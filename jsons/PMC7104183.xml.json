            "text": "The 2012 emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia was the second major introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population since the outbreak of SARS-CoV in China in 2003 (Assiri et al., 2013, Zaki et al., 2012). The global spread of SARS-CoV resulted in more than 8,000 infections and nearly 800 deaths worldwide (Peiris et al., 2004). Fortunately, the SARS-CoV epidemic rapidly died off because of conventional public health measures, even if the exact mechanism of its introduction into, and disappearance from, the human population still remains a mystery (Graham et al., 2013). By contrast, the MERS-CoV epidemic has persisted for more than 5 years with no signs of abating (http://www.who.int/csr/don/10-november-2017-mers-oman/en/). Apart from the sudden initial outbreak in Saudi Arabia, MERS-CoV has spread to other countries outside the Arabian Peninsula carried by infected travelers (Bermingham et al., 2012), leading to an outbreak in South Korea in 2015 (Choi, 2015). These are continuous reports of human MERS-CoV infection in affected regions, largely due to contact with dromedary camels, which are believed to be a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and the immediate source of human infection (Haagmans et al., 2014, Hemida et al., 2014). Compared with SARS-CoV with a fatality rate of approximately 10% (Peiris et al., 2004), MERS-CoV appears to be more deadly, with its fatality rate reaching as high as 35% (de Wit et al., 2016). All of these facts indicate that MERS-CoV will remain as a severe and long-time threat to global health and highlight the urgent need for effective prophylactic and therapeutic measures.",

            "text": "Scientific progress achieved since the SARS-CoV epidemic has greatly increased our capacity to respond to MERS-CoV. Like that of SARS-CoV, the spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV plays a critical role in mediating viral entry and in inducing a protective antibody response in infected individuals (Raj et al., 2013, Zumla et al., 2016). The isolation of potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies has been reported shortly after the identification of MERS-CoV. This was achieved by using various technological platforms such as phage or yeast display of antibody library (Jiang et al., 2014, Tang et al., 2014, Ying et al., 2014), immunization of experimental animals (Chen et al., 2017a, Du et al., 2014, Li et al., 2015, Pascal et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015a), and direct isolation from human survivors of MERS-CoV infection (Chen et al., 2017b, Corti et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2018). Currently, close to 20 different neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been characterized in cell culture and experimental animal models. A large majority target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein and interfere with the binding of the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). We previously reported the isolation of the two neutralizing antibodies MERS-4 and MERS-27 via screening of a yeast-displayed library of human scFv (single-chain variable domain fragment) using the MERS-CoV RBD as bait (Jiang et al., 2014). Both antibodies demonstrated potent neutralizing activity against live and pseudotyped MERS-CoV, and a high level of synergy when used together.",

We and others have demonstrated that MERS-CoV RBD possesses core and receptor-binding subdomains (Chen et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2015a). A large majority of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV, including MERS-27, 4C2, D12, JC57-14, m336, MCA1, and CDC-C2, have been found to target the receptor-binding subdomain and overlap with the DPP4 binding surface (Chen et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015a, Wang et al., 2018, Ying et al., 2015, Yu et al., 2015). Therefore, these antibodies share at least one similar aspect of neutralization by directly competing with the cellular receptor DPP4 for binding to RBD.",

In contrast to all the reported RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies that compete with DPP4 for binding to the RBD, MERS-4 and MERS-4V2 approached the RBD from the outside of the RBD-DPP4 binding interface. Site-directed mutagenesis identified several key residues critical for binding and the neutralizing activity of MERS-4 and MERS-4V2. Structural comparisons of the RBD in unbound, DPP4-bound, and antibody-bound states revealed significant conformational changes in the RBD when bound to MERS-4 or MERS-4V2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that a MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody can indirectly interfere with DPP4 binding through conformational changes. Its unique epitope specificity and unusual mechanism of action enable MERS-4 to synergize with other antibodies, providing a valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against MERS-CoV infection.",

However, the yield of MERS-4 from the transfected HEK293F cells was rather low (<1 mg/L), hampering our efforts toward detailed structural analysis. To identify a variant with improved productivity, we generated a library of mutant MERS-4 comprising random replacements in the 5-residue-long CDR3 region, displayed on the surface of yeast, and selected for binding to the RBD through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based sorting as described previously (Jiang et al., 2014). Among a total of 17 selected mutants, only the variant MERS-4V2 demonstrated a substantial improvement of productivity (>10-fold) while maintaining potency as strong as that of the original MERS-4 in neutralizing pseudotyped virus and binding the S trimer (Figure S1A). Sequence analysis showed that the original CDR3 residues Ala-Gly-Asn-Asp (AGND) of MERS-4 were replaced by Thr-Asn-Thr-Tyr (TNTY) in MERS-4V2 (Figure S1B).",

However, despite our repeated efforts in optimizing and screening more than 200 crystals, we were only able to obtain X-ray diffraction data of RBD in complex with MERS-4 Fab at 4.5 \u00c5 and with MERS-4V2 Fab at 7 \u00c5. Nevertheless, we solved the structure of the MERS-4 Fab/RBD complex (PDB: 5ZXV) and refined it to R\nwork and R\nfree factors of 30.2% and 34.4%, respectively (Figure S2A; Table S1). We went further to construct an scFv version of MERS-4V2 and replaced the MERS-4V2 Fab during complex formation with RBD. The structure of the MERS-4V2 scFv/RBD complex (PDB: 5YY5) was successfully solved to a resolution of 2.8 \u00c5 with R\nwork and R\nfree factors of 24.7% and 27.7%, respectively (Figure S2B; Table S1).",

At the binding interface, the \u03b27-\u03b28 loop of RBD inserted into the cavity between the antibody heavy and light chains, forming interactions with all CDR loops of the antibody except for HCDR3 (Figures 1C and 1D). In particular, the short \u03b25-\u03b26 loop interacted with the HCDR1 and HCDR2 loops of the antibody heavy chain, and the long \u03b26-\u03b27 loop predominately interacted with the LCDR2 loop of the antibody light chain (Figures 1C and 1D).",

At the binding interface, 16 MERS-4V2 scFV residues from all 6 CDR except for HCRD3 formed contacts with 15 residues from the \u03b25-\u03b26, \u03b26-\u03b27, and \u03b27-\u03b28 loops of the receptor-binding subdomain of the RBD (Figure 2A; Table S2). Specifically, the RBD residues Leu507 and Ser508 from the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop interacted with Ser30, Asn31, and Tyr53 from the heavy chain (Figure 2B; Table S2). The RBD residues Gln516, Asn519, Asn521, Gln522, Tyr523, and Pro525 from the \u03b26-\u03b27 loop interacted with Tyr50, Trp51, Asp53, Gln54, Arg55, and Asp61 from the antibody light chain (Figures 2C and 2D; Table S2). Furthermore, the RBD residues Lys543, and Leu545 to Gly550 from the \u03b27-\u03b28 loop interacted with Ala33, Tyr35, Tyr53, and Tyr59 from the heavy chain, as well as Asn32, Tyr33, Tyr35, Trp51, and Trp92 from the light chain (Figures 2B and 2E; Table S2). Among all interactions at the interface, one example of hydrophobic interactions involved Leu548 (RBD \u03b27-\u03b28 loop), Tyr35 (heavy chain), Tyr35 (light chain), and Trp92 (light chain) (Figures 2B and 2E; Table S2). Examples of hydrogen bonds included Ser508 (RBD \u03b25-\u03b26 loop) to Tyr53 (heavy chain), Asn519 (RBD \u03b26-\u03b27 loop) to Tyr50 (light chain), Asn521 (RBD \u03b26-\u03b27 loop) to Asp61 (light chain), and Gln522 (RBD \u03b26-\u03b27 loop) to Arg55 (light chain) (Figures 2B\u20132D; Table S2). As indicated above, the HCDR3 appeared not to be involved in the RBD interaction within a distance cutoff of 4.0 \u00c5. This may explain the unchanged neutralizing and binding activities of MERS-4V2 compared with the parental MERS-4 despite the four-residue replacement in the HCDR3 (Figures S1A and S1B).",

            "text": "We have previously shown that MERS-4 interfered with the interaction between soluble RBD and the cellular receptor DPP4 expressed on the surface of Huh7 cells (Jiang et al., 2014). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis showed that the binding of soluble RBD to chip-coupled DPP4 was reduced in the presence of increasing concentrations of MERS-4 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S3). However, structural superimposition demonstrated that the epitope targeted by MERS-4 and MERS-4V2 is located outside the DPP4 binding surface on the RBD (Figure 3\n). This apparent disconnect prompted us to compare all of the available RBD structures in the unbound (PDB: 4ZPW, 4KQZ, and 4L3N) (Chen et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2015a), DPP4-bound (PDB: 4L72 and 4KR0) (Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013), MERS-4-bound, and MERS-4V2-bound states (Figure 3A). While the overall structure of RBD remained relatively stable in all the different states, the MERS-4- or MERS-4V2-bound RBD was found to have a conformational change of the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop (Leu506 to Glu513) (Figure 3A). This particular change involved the folding of the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop toward a shallow groove on the RBD interface critical for accommodating a short helix of DPP4 (Figure 3A). The maximum distance change occurred at Asp510, whose C\u03b1 atom moved more than 3 \u00c5 into the groove (Figure 3B). Our previous study revealed that the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop participates in the formation of a shallow groove to accommodate the docking of a short helix of DPP4 in patch 2 of the binding interface (Figure 3C) (Wang et al., 2013). Residues Leu506, Asp510, and Glu513 from this loop were found to be involved in forming the core hydrophobic and peripheral hydrophilic interactions in patch 2 (Figure 3C), and mutations of these residues decreased the binding affinity between RBD and DPP4 significantly. The conformational change identified here is therefore expected to bring steric clashes between Asp510 from RBD and Ser292 and Arg317 from DPP4 (Figure 3D), thereby preventing the docking of the short helix of DPP4 into the shallow groove of RBD.",

The working hypothesis is that all three RBDs in the \u201cdown\u201d position keep the S trimer in an inactive, non-receptor-binding state, whereas at least one RBD in the \u201cup\u201d position is required for the S trimer to be in an activated, receptor-binding state (Pallesen et al., 2017, Yuan et al., 2017). To study which state MERS-4 could bind and access its epitope, we superimposed MERS-4 Fab/RBD crystal structures onto the MERS-CoV S trimer structure in the two major conformational states. At the same time, we also analyzed the binding of receptor DPP4 and MERS-27 to the S trimer glycoprotein. As shown in Figure 4\n, severe steric clashes would be expected between MERS-4 Fab and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighboring S monomer when all three RBD are in the \u201cdown\u201d position, suggesting that the epitope of MERS-4 is covered and inaccessible in the inactivated state. By contrast, when there was one RBD in the \u201cup\u201d position, the epitope of MERS-4 became readily exposed and accessible. Similarly, the receptor DPP4 also favored RBD in the \u201cup\u201d over the one in the \u201cdown\u201d position (Pallesen et al., 2017, Yuan et al., 2017). However, the MERS-27 epitope was readily accessible regardless of the state of the RBD. Taken together, these results indicate that MERS-4 binds to the RBD in the \u201cup\u201d position when the virus becomes partially activated. MERS-27, however, binds to the RBD irrespective of the conformational states within the S trimer.",

All of the mutants except for Leu548 could be expressed and purified in insect cells as the same way as the wild-type RBD. The SPR analysis showed that mutations at Leu507, Leu545, Ser546, Pro547, and Glu549 in the RBD significantly decreased the binding affinity to MERS-4 (Figures 5\nA and S4A) and MERS-4V2 (Figures 5A and S4B) by more than 10-fold. The mutation at Ser508 decreased the binding affinity to both antibodies by less than 3-fold (Figures 5A and S4). We next measured the neutralization activity of MERS-4 against pseudotyped viruses bearing wild-type or mutant S glycoprotein (Leu507Ala, Leu545Ala, Ser546Ala, and Pro547Ala) in the cell entry assay. Consistent with the binding changes, pseudotyped viruses bearing these mutations became less sensitive to MERS-4 neutralization (Figure 5B). Those bearing Ser508Ala, Leu548Ala, or Glu549Ala mutations failed to produce detectable amounts of infectious viral particles and therefore were excluded from our experiments. Lastly, we went further to study whether the binding of MERS-4 to the mutant S glycoprotein was also reduced when the protein was expressed on the surface of cells. Specifically, transfected HEK293T cells expressing either the wild-type or mutant S glycoprotein were harvested, stained with MERS-4 or antibody 5F9 specific for the NTD of S glycoprotein as a control (Chen et al., 2017a), and analyzed by FACS. As shown in Figure 5C, MERS-4 demonstrated variable levels of reduction in its binding to the mutant S glycoprotein, while the control antibody 5F9 remained virtually unchanged. Furthermore, the L545A mutation completely abolished the binding activity of MERS-4, which was consistent with the results obtained using the pseudotyped viruses. These results suggest that reduced binding affinity of MERS-4 to the mutant S glycoprotein is one of the major contributors to viral resistance. Collectively, we confirmed the unique epitope targeted by MERS-4 and MERS-4V2 observed in the crystal structures and highlighted the unusual mechanism of neutralization by these antibodies.",

It prompted us to study the combined binding of MERS-4 and MERS-27 to the RBD. Gel filtration analysis showed that the peak of the mixture comprising RBD, MERS-4 Fab, and MERS-27 Fab had a forward shift compared with that of the RBD/MERS-4 Fab complex (Figure S6A), indicating that MERS-4 and MERS-27 could bind to the RBD at the same time. To confirm this, we used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) study on the purified ternary complex in solution. We initially built a monomeric model of the RBD/MERS-4/MERS-27 ternary complex, which was generated by superimposing the RBD/MERS-4 and RBD/MERS-27 crystal structures. However, the monomeric model fits poorly to the SAXS data with a \u03c7 value of 7.0 (Figure 6\n). To investigate the assembly of the complex, we built a dimeric model of the ternary complex using the interface observed in the RBD/MERS-27 crystal structure. To understand the dynamic assembly, MultiFoXS was applied to define the population of the models in solution (Pelikan et al., 2009). SAXS fitting with multi-state models (31% monomer model, 18% dimer model of the RBD/MERS-4/MERS-27, and 51% RBD/MERS-27) significantly improved the goodness of the fit with a \u03c7 value of 2.0 (Figure 6), revealing the transient complexation of Fabs. The transient behavior was also observed from the SEC-SAXS (size exclusion chromatography in line with SAXS) (Figure S6). The broad distribution of radius of gyration (Rg) values across the SEC-SAXS peak, ranging from 47 to 37 \u00c5 (Figure S6B), suggests a multi-state mixture of the complex, which was further confirmed by the good fits obtained for various sections of the SEC-SAXS peak using ensemble models (Figures S6C and S6D). These results collectively showed that MERS-4 and MERS-27 are capable of binding to RBD at different epitopes to form a ternary complex.",

The synergy between them was consistent with the unique epitopes of MERS-4 and MERS-27 on the RBD (Figure 7\nC). Here, we further tested whether MERS-4 could synergize with additional antibodies targeting either the RBD (m336) or NTD (5F9) of the S glycoprotein. As shown in Figure 7A, the percent neutralization obtained using combined MERS-4 and m336 demonstrated a 2.60-fold reduction of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and 2.73-fold reduction of IC80 compared with that of either MERS-4 or m336 alone. Furthermore, the combination index (CI) values of combined MERS-4 and m336 at fractional effect values of effective dose 50%, 75%, 90%, and 95% (ED50, ED75, ED90, and ED95) were 0.48, 0.38, 0.30, and 0.26, respectively. As a CI value of 1 indicates an additive effect, <1 indicates synergism, and >1 indicates antagonism, the combination of MERS-4 and m336 works in a clearly synergistic manner. Furthermore, the combination of MERS-4 and 5F9 demonstrated better synergy in particular at relatively lower concentrations (Figure 7B). The percent neutralization of combined MERS-4 and 5F9 demonstrated a 15.21-fold reduction in IC50 and 52.7-fold reduction in IC80 compared with that of either antibody alone. Furthermore, the CI values of combined MERS-4 and 5F9 at fractional effect values of ED 50%, 75%, 90%, and 95% (ED50, ED75, ED90, and ED95) were 0.06, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.06, respectively.

The structure of MERS-4 Fab bound to RBD was determined at a resolution of 4.5 \u00c5, and that of MERS-4V2 scFv bound to RBD was solved at 2.8 \u00c5. MERS-4 and MERS-4V2 demonstrated the same binding mode and epitope specificity. In contrast to all other RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies, which directly compete with DPP4 for binding to the RBD, MERS-4 and MERS-4V2 approached the RBD outside the RBD-DPP4 binding interface by targeting the \u03b25-\u03b26, \u03b26-\u03b27, and \u03b27-\u03b28 loops. MERS-4- and MERS-4V2-bound RBD demonstrated significant conformational changes largely involving the folding of the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop toward a shallow groove on the RBD interface critical for accommodating a short helix of DPP4. In the context of the S trimer, MERS-4 prefers binding to the RBD in the \u201cup\u201d rather than the \u201cdown\u201d position when virus becomes partially activated. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the key residues critical for binding and neutralizing activities of MERS-4 and MERS-4V2. Reduced affinity for the RBD appeared to be the major contributor to the compromised neutralizing activities against the mutant viruses. A synergistic effect was observed between MERS-4 and RBD-specific (m336) as well as NTD-specific (5F9) antibodies, although the exact mechanism remains unknown. Taken together, our study reveals that MERS-4 and MERS-4V2 recognize a unique neutralizing epitope with an unusual mechanism of action. Such special features will enable MERS-4 to synergize with other antibodies and provide a valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against MERS-CoV infection.",

Among close to 20 reported neutralizing antibodies, the large majority (MERS-27, m336, D12, 4C2, MCA1, CDC-C2, and JC57-14) were shown to directly compete with the cellular receptor DPP4 for binding to the RBD (Chen et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015a, Wang et al., 2018, Ying et al., 2015, Yu et al., 2015). This dominant mechanism of action is further supported by structural studies in which their epitopes were found to clearly, although variably, overlap with the DPP4 binding surface (Figure S7). Because MERS-4 shares many biochemical and biological features with the abovementioned antibodies, it was expected that its mechanism of neutralization would follow the same suit. However, a novel epitope specificity and unusual mechanism of action came as a pleasant surprise. This not only reveals a new vulnerable site on the RBD, but also provides a novel target for future vaccine design and development.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that antibody binding can indirectly disrupt the interaction between RBD with DPP4. While the exact process requires further study, there are at least two possibilities. One is that the antibody captures and fixes one of the RBD conformational states when the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop spontaneously bends toward the receptor binding interface. Given the highly dynamic nature of RBD in the context of the S trimer, it is plausible that some of the loop structures in the RBD could also be quite flexible, providing opportunities for antibody binding during the structural transformation. The other is that the antibody itself triggers such a structural alteration. If this were the case, the heavy chain of MERS-4 or MERS-4V2 would likely push and fold the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop toward the receptor binding interface in order to achieve optimal binding. This hypothesis is supported by atomic analysis of the interaction between MERS-4V2 and the RBD. Among a total of 16 interactive binding residues, 14 from the \u03b26-\u03b27 and \u03b27-\u03b28 loops interacted with the light chain, whereas 2 in the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop participated in binding with the heavy chain. The interactions between the \u03b26-\u03b27 and \u03b27-\u03b28 loops of the RBD and the light chain of MERS-4V2 are therefore the most likely the driving force of antigen-antibody binding. However, optimal binding of MERS-4 would require the heavy chain to overcome the steric obstruction by pushing and folding the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop toward the binding interface, resulting in a distorted conformation as shown in the crystal structure. Regardless of the exact process, the observed folding of the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop toward the binding interface would be expected to disrupt the docking of the short helix of DPP4 onto the binding surface of RBD, thereby blocking virus entry. Of note, such unique mechanism of action has not been reported for other viruses. Antibodies against the receptor binding site (RBS) of influenza virus and the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of HIV type I (HIV-1) exert their neutralizing activities largely through direct competition with their respective receptors (Wu and Kong, 2016, Ren and Zhou, 2016). Perhaps the closest scenario to MERS-4-mediated inhibition is found in antibodies targeting the V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope where binding may capture or induce conformational changes that block the subsequent interaction between the V3 region and the co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. Certainly, such a hypothesis would have to be verified in the future (Barnes et al., 2018, Mouquet et al., 2012, Pejchal et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein showed limited sequence variation among different strains, especially in the RBD that is responsible for receptor binding. However, this does not mean the spike glycoprotein will remain unchanged as the virus continues to spread among multiple animal species and to probe and adapt in human population. For stronger and broader protective effect against MERS-CoV, a combined use of two or more antibodies will provide a superior alternative (Wang et al., 2018). However, any effective combination would require the candidate antibodies to recognize distinct epitopes for additive or synergistic effect. The unique epitope of MERS-4 and MERS-4V2 therefore makes them good candidates for combination use with those reported elsewhere (Chen et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015a, Wang et al., 2018, Ying et al., 2015, Yu et al., 2015). Indeed, combinations of MERS-4 and MERS-27, MERS-4 and m336, and MERS-4 and 5F9 demonstrated impressive synergy in the pseudotyped MERS-CoV assay. The exact mechanism in achieving the synergy, however, is uncertain, particularly for those sharing the same mechanism in disrupting interaction between RBD and DPP4 (MERS-4 and MERS-27, and MERS-4 and m336). Presumably, the two antibodies may preferentially act on RBD at the different spatial and temporal points during interaction with the receptor DPP4, allowing better exposure of otherwise less accessible epitopes. If this is the case, the observed synergy would be most likely derived from the recognitions of distinct epitopes rather than the same neutralization mechanism. Obviously, antibodies with distinct mechanisms and binding at disparate epitopes would be more likely to have synergy than those shared mechanism and overlapped epitopes. Synergy showed here between MERS-4 and 5F9 is a good example. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms underlying synergy must be complex and should be treated differently from case to case. The preliminary results presented here do offer some rationales for MERS-4 as a valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against MERS-CoV infection.",

The scattering vector is defined as q = 4\u03c0 sin\u03b8/\u03bb, where 2\u03b8 is the scattering angle. SEC in line with SEC-SAXS was performed to ensure the aggregation-free state of the sample. The SEC column was equilibrated with running buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.3], 100 mM NaCl, 3% glycerol, and 0.01% sodium azide) with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The 50-\u03bcL sample was run through the SEC and 2-s X-ray exposures were collected continuously during an \u223c25-min elution. The SAXS frames recorded prior to the protein elution peak were used to subtract all other frames. The subtracted frames were investigated by R\ng and scattering intensity at q = 0 \u00c5\u22121 (I(0)) derived by the Guinier approximation I(q) = I(0) exp(\u2212q\n2\nR\ng\n2/3) with the limits qR\ng < 1.5 (Guinier and Fournet, 1955). I (0) and R\ng values were compared for each collected SAXS curve across the entire elution peak. The elution peak was mapped by plotting the scattering intensity at q = 0 \u00c5\u22121 (I (0)) relative to the recorded frame. Graduate decreasing of R\ng values across an elution peak indicates transient sample behavior. SAXS was also acquired in the high-throughput modality at sample concentrations between 1 and 5 mg/mL to compare with the SEC-SAXS profile (Hura et al., 2009). The full atomic model was built with the program MODELER to construct the missing loops and linkers (Sali and Blundell, 1993). The theoretical SAXS profile and the corresponding fit to the experimental data were calculated using the program FoXS (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2013). A multistate model of complexes coexisting in solution was selected by MultiFoXS (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2016). The size of the multistate model was selected based on the level of improvement in the SAXS fit.",
