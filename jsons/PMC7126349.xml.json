            "text": "Recoding is a mechanism of gene expression that permits more than one polypeptide to be translated from an otherwise monocistronic mRNA, often with important biological consequences (15, 18). Translational recoding events include shifts in reading frame during translational elongation. Normally, maintenance of the reading frame is a highly accurate process, with error rates of less than 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 per codon (Kurland 1992); however, specific signals and structures in mRNA can increase the probability of the elongating ribosome to change reading frame as much as 104-fold (2, 15, 18). Shifts in frame are almost always limited to one base and can occur in either the upstream, or leftward, direction (termed \u22121 frameshifts) or in the downstream, or rightward, direction (termed +1 frameshifts). In eukaryotes, frameshifting had been found only in mRNAs of retrotransposons, retroviruses, and certain RNA viruses until their recent discovery in certain herpesvirus and cellular mRNAs (24, 35, 38). Examples of ribosomal hopping, which have been documented in either the Escherichia coli trp gene or the T4 gene 60, have not yet been described in eukaryotes (6, 46).",

The stimulatory structure pauses elongating ribosomes on the slippery sequence (42, 44), which is thought to facilitate slippage of the P and A site tRNAs on the mRNA from XXY\u2013YYZ to XXX\u2013YYY (requiring bonding between each tRNA\u2013codon pair at at least two out of three positions). Translation then proceeds in the \u22121 frame. All examples of eukaryotic +1 frameshifting thus far also entail a site at which recoding occurs, and a stimulator. Frameshifting occurs either by slippage (Belcourt and Farabaugh 1990) or by a mechanism whereby specific structural features of the tRNA in the P site appear to facilitate out-of-frame binding of an aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site (16, 35, 36, 45). As is true for \u22121 frameshifting, stimulators of +1 frameshifting cause translational pausing. They include \u201chungry\u201d codons that are decoded by rare tRNAs, termination codons, and pseudoknots (5, 16, 35). However, in the case of the yeast retrotransposon TY3, an additional distal sequence also stimulates frameshifting by an as yet unknown mechanism (15, 16).",

            "text": "Recently, we have described a recoding event in a herpes simplex virus (HSV) mutant that permits the expression of low levels (1%\u20132% of wild type) of full-length thymidine kinase (TK) despite a single base insertion in the HSV tk gene (Hwang et al. 1994). Expression of full-length TK thus requires a net +1 shift in frame, which has been shown to occur during translation (Hwang et al. 1994). The biological consequences of this recoding event include the reactivation of the mutant from latent infection upon explant of mouse trigeminal ganglia; truly TK\u2013negative mutants do not ordinarily reactivate from such infections (10, 13, 27). This may have clinical importance, especially in immunocompromised patients such as those with AIDS, in whom reactivation of HSV from latent infection can cause severe disease. Therapy with the antiviral drug acyclovir (ACV) has been successful in the treatment of such disease; however, treatment failures associated with ACV-resistant virus are a problem (14, 23). Since the selective action of ACV entails its specific phosphorylation by HSV TK (Fyfe et al. 1978), tk mutations can confer resistance (Coen and Schaffer 1980). Indeed, the tk mutant in which recoding occurs is ACV-resistant and arose in a patient who suffered severe herpes esophagitis despite ACV therapy (Sacks et al. 1989). We hypothesize that this mutant was selected in the patient because it expresses too little TK to activate ACV effectively but enough TK to cause disease.",

Because this recoding event was not very efficient (1%\u20132%) and was difficult to quantify, we decided to make use of a sensitive and quantitative enzyme reporter system that has been used to investigate the role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T cell leukemia virus II sequences in frameshifting in transfected cells (30, 37). To adapt this system for in vitro analysis, the reporter genes encoding \u03b2-galactosidase and luciferase separated by the HIV elements were placed under the control of bacteriophage T3 promoter to create T3 LucLac (Figure 1). A 207 bp SnaBI\u2013SacI blunt-ended fragment from pTK-4, containing mutant tk sequences sufficient for recoding (Experimental Procedures), was then cloned between the reporter genes, replacing the HIV slippery sequence (Figure 1). This plasmid was called BCH2. Following transcription with T3 RNA polymerase and translation of the synthetic mRNA in reticulocyte lysates, luciferase activity from the \u03b2-galactosidase\u2013luciferase fusion protein can be detected when a recoding event that shifts translation into the +1 frame occurs. The relative enzymatic activities of \u03b2-galactosidase and luciferase reflect the frameshifting efficiency. To normalize this efficiency, we constructed two control plasmids. Reference plasmid, BCH1, was created by cloning the corresponding wild-type tk sequences from pTK-wt (Experimental Procedures) between the reporter genes (Figure 1). This plasmid expresses an in-frame \u03b2-galactosidase\u2013luciferase fusion. Its ratio of luciferase activity to \u03b2-galactosidase activity was set at 100%. A negative control plasmid, BCH0, was created. It contained luciferase-coding sequences in the +1 reading frame relative to \u03b2-galactosidase but lacked any HSV sequence. This allowed subtraction of background \u201cnoise\u201d generated within the system (0.05%). For each plasmid, assays were repeated 4 to more than 30 times to obtain means and standard deviations. In these assays, BCH2 reproducibly yielded a low but significant efficiency (1%) of net +1 frameshifting (Figure 1). This efficiency will be referred to as frameshifting at \u201cstandard levels.\u201d\n",

However, a control plasmid, BCH4a, which contained 16 nt of a randomly generated sequence, did not frameshift (Figure 1).

This model has been borne out in the examples examined thus far (42, 44). Given the lack of effect of the HIV stimulator, we asked whether paused ribosomes could be detected during recoding in the HSV tk system, using the translational inhibitor edeine (Somogyi et al. 1993). Briefly, ribosomes were allowed to initiate on mRNA in the presence of 35S methionine. Then, after a short time, the drug was added to prevent further initiation. This resulted in a relatively synchronous pulse of ribosomes whose products could be sampled at various times throughout the reaction. Interruption of elongation, i.e., pausing, can result in a detectable \u201cpaused\u201d product on SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gels.",

EcoRI cuts just 3\u2032 to the G-rich sequence; thus, transcription and translation resulted in a labeled product of the same size as the potential paused product, approximately 44 kDa (Figure 3B, lane P). ScaI-digested DNA was transcribed, the synthetic RNA translated (with edeine added following initiation), and the products electrophoresed through SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gels. Paused products of the expected size were not detected (Figure 3B; data not shown [the product below and clearly resolved from the 44 kDa marker was due to methonine labeling of an endogenous reticulocyte polypeptide]). In contrast, a control plasmid, pPS1a (Somogyi et al. 1993; a gift of I. Brierley), which contains a coronavirus pseudoknot, produced a paused product of the expected size, 42 kDa (data not shown). However, as the sensitivity of these assays was limited, we cannot totally discount the possibility that a very low level pause occurs at the HSV recoding site.

Thus far, however, all attempts to determine the site of recoding by protein sequencing have failed, primarily due to low frameshift efficiency (B. C. H. and S. Matusfuji, unpublished data). Therefore, we decided to use site-directed mutagenesis to address this question. In an initial attempt to define the site of frameshifting, we mutated the C at position 7 in BCH15 to a T, yielding plasmid BCH16, i.e., GGG-GGG-CGA-GGC-TGG-G to GGG-GGG-TGA-GGC-TGG-G. (Bold characters represent the differences; T's indicated in the DNA sequence become U's in the RNA). This mutation resulted in a termination codon (underlined) in-frame with \u03b2-galactosidase. This termination codon did not measurably affect frameshifting, since luciferase expression of BCH16 and BCH15 were comparable (Figure 1). This indicates that ribosomes enter the luciferase reading frame without recognizing the termination codon. (Also, the termination codon, which is known to stimulate +1 frameshifting in other systems, did not stimulate the HSV recoding event.) Luciferase expression from pBCH16a, TGA-GGG-GGG-GGA-GGC-TGG-G, which has a TGA codon inserted in the \u03b2-galactosidase reading frame immediately upstream of the G(8) motif, was not detectable (Figure 1). The results from BCH 16 and BCH16A, taken together, imply that the frameshift at least initiates between the termination codons; that is, on the G-string.",

The likely site of recoding, underlined, is decoded by two tRNAGLY\nCCC species, whereas the next two codons, GGA and GGC, are decoded by tRNAGLY\nUCC and tRNAGLY\nGCC. None of these is a rare tRNA (Gupta et al. 1980) and consequently should not induce a pause to facilitate tRNA/mRNA realignment. Nevertheless, we wished to investigate the effect that different glycine tRNA isoacceptors might have on frameshifting. (Glycine tRNAs decode the sequence GGX, where X = G, A, C, or UGupta et al. 1980). We mutated the third and sixth G of the recoding site (bold characters above) to A, C, or T (plasmids BCH12, BCHH3, and BCHH4, respectively). Analysis of these constructs revealed that BCH12 (GGA-GGA-GGA-GGC-TGG-G) expressed low but detectable levels of luciferase, whereas BCHH3 (GGC-GGC-GGA-GGC-TGG-G) and BCHH4 (GGT-GGT-GGA-GGC-TGG-G) did not (Figure 1). These data suggest that if specific tRNAs are involved in the recoding event, they would have to be tRNAGLY\nCCC decoding GGG or tRNAGLY\nUCC decoding GGA. Importantly, the results with BCH12 indicate that a tRNAGLY\nUCC slippage model is unlikely because tRNA does not form a middle base pair with the next +1 codon, GAG; the predicted C:A pair has been shown to inhibit frameshifting 80- to 240-fold in a +1 frameshift system that utilizes slippage (Curran 1993).",

We first mutated the BCH4 sequence, GGG-GGG-GGA- GGC-TGG-G, to AGG-GGG-GGG-AGG-CTG-G, creating BCH13 (Figure 1). This mutant, decoded by ARG-GLY-GLY-ARG-LEU, frameshifted at standard (1%) levels (Figure 1), indicating that when two Gly GGG codons are bounded by G residues, they direct recoding as well as do eight or more G residues comprising three glycine codons. This finding was underscored and extended by the construction and expression of BCH18. The seventh nucleotide in the G-string of BCH13 was mutated to an A. While this conserves the purine richness of the sequence, it shortens the G-string to 6 nt. BCH18 (AGG-GGG-GAG-AGG-CTG-G), decoded by ARG-GLY-GLU-ARG-LEU (only one Gly codon, GGG), expressed luciferase at just slightly lower levels than BCH15 and BCH16, whereas BCH6 (GGG-GGA-GGC-TGG-G), decoded by GLY-GLY-GLY-TRP (one GGG and one GGA codon), did not frameshift (Figure 1). However, we would not expect BCH6 to frameshift if the recoding event were a \u22122 slip, because tRNAGLY\nCCC is able to slip either +1 or \u22122 in mutant BCH15, BCH16, and BCH18 but only +1 in mutant BCH6 (tRNAGLY\nCCC does not form a middle base pair with the \u22122 codon GAG in BCH6; Figure 1). Therefore, we constructed two additional mutants, BCH20 (AGG-GGG-TGA-GGC-TGG-G) and BCH21 (AGG-GGG-TAG-AGG-CTG-G), in which tRNAGLY\nCCC would be able to slip \u22122 or +1 equally well. These mutants included a UAG or UGA termination codon (underlined), which when downstream of a recoding site can act as stimulators of programmed frameshifting (35, 46). Neither mutant frameshifted (Figure 1). These results imply that neither specific glycine tRNAs nor tRNA slippage mechanisms are likely to be responsible for the recoding event. Rather, the G-richness of the mRNA sequence is important.",

Mechanisms that have been invoked to explain the actual recoding event at the frameshifting site, which both entail a kinetically slow step that is more favorable when ribosomes are paused, are, first, slippage; and second, specific peptidyl tRNAs, which are thought to facilitate out-of-frame binding of tRNAs at the A site (reviewed byFarabaugh 1996). The efficiency of frameshifting is generally considered to depend on the extent of pausing, and, in particular, weakly functioning recoding sites are most affected by the presence of stimulators. We failed to detect paused ribosomes at the HSV tk recoding site (Figure 3B), suggesting that the HSV frameshift does not involve a kinetically slower second step. Given the low efficiency of the tk frameshift, it could be argued that the pause was too short for us to detect. Nevertheless, if pausing were important for the tk frameshift, one would expect that stimulators would greatly increase frameshift efficiency. Instead, neither a downstream RNA structure nor termination codons increased frameshift efficiency. Thus, it appears that the tk frameshift operates via a mechanism that does not entail a kinetically slow step that is enhanced by ribosomal pausing.",

Of these, UAG and UGA are nonsense codons and are, in general, more slowly decoded than sense codons. (These nonsense codons operated efficiently in the antizyme frameshift system, which, like the HSV frameshift system, has been characterized in a mammalian systemMatsufuji et al. 1995). GGA is an intermediately used codon, and GGG and GAG are very commonly used (\u201cwell-fed\u201d) codons (Haas et al. 1996). Thus, if the HSV frameshift were conventional, we would expect higher frameshift efficiencies with A-site codons UAG and UGA, intermediate frameshift efficiencies with GGA codons, and lower frameshift efficiencies with GGG and GAG codons.

Indeed, replacement of A- or U-rich codons with G- or C-rich triplets reduced frameshifting in \u22121 frameshift systems that utilize slippage (7, 26), and replacement of third position U's in the in-phase triplet decreased frameshifting in a +1 system, suggesting that the weakness of wobble pairs facilitates +1 slippage (Curran 1993). One might imagine a scenario whereby the mRNA G-string interacts, for example, with rRNA (see below) in a way that might promote tRNA slippage. For example, if the G-string formed non\u2013Watson-Crick base pairs with rRNA, that would weaken the hydrogen bonds between the O6 positions of G's in the codon and C's in the anticodon. It would be tempting to speculate that the weakening of these bonds could add to the slipperiness of the mRNA\u2013tRNA complex. However, for this scenario to be viable, we would expect that an A string would also promote net +1 frameshifting, since A\u2013U base pairs have even less energy than the weakened G\u2013C base pairs imagined above. This did not occur (BCH 11; Figure 1). Moreover, this model would predict that an RNA structure or termination codon that enhanced the probability of the second, kinetically slower, slip would increase the efficiency of frameshifting, which did not occur. Thus, it is difficult to consider slippage on G-strings as a viable explanation for our results.",

Grosjean and co-workers (1978) demonstrated that centrally positioned C:A or A:C pairs abolished synthetic anticodon\u2013codon complexes. Such mismatches decrease frameshifting more than 80-fold in the +1 E. coli RF2 system (Curran 1993), compared with the only 3-fold decrease in the HSV tk frameshift (BCH12, Figure 1). Thus, the ability of BCH12 to frameshift is very difficult to explain by either conventional slippage or by the unconventional mechanism considered above.

Formation of an intramolecular structure in the ribosome has been proposed to account for the T4 gene 60 ribosomal hop (22, 47). In the intramolecular model for the tk frameshift, one of the nucleotides within the G-string would bulge out so that it does not pair with a tRNA, either in the P site or in the A site. Thus, in the ribosome, the two tRNAs bound to the mRNA would form an RNA helix in which an extra nucleotide between the tRNAs is excluded from base pairing. However, as pointed out by Farabaugh et al. 1993, who considered a similar model to explain the TY3 +1 frameshift, it is more likely that such an excluded base would still stack between the paired nucleotides on either side. This has been observed in several RNA structures (1, 28). Thus, in this model, some kind of folding of the mRNA on itself would be required to stabilize a bulge. We have obtained preliminary evidence that the G-string is contained within a structure resistant to RNase T1, consistent with this idea (data not shown).",

Our results indicate that shorter G-strings (e.g., G6), within purine-rich contexts, promote net +1 recoding, although at lower levels (Figure 1).

For example, HSV-1 tk genes contain one G(6) and one G(7) string, and HSV-2 tk genes contain two G(6) and one G(7) string. It has been suggested that the high mutation frequency in the tk gene of HSV may be a consequence of these guanine repeats (Kit et al. 1987), and, indeed, Hwang and Chen 1995 have obtained evidence that frameshift mutations can occur frequently in the G(7) string. If this is so, why would a virus retain sequences that accumulate mutations? Perhaps the virus can tolerate mutations in these sequences because it generates so many wild-type copies per infected cell. Nevertheless, one speculation is that the G-string sequences have been retained because they permit the expression of alternate polypeptides. Regardless, a consequence of our results is that the translational machinery can partly compensate for mutations in the G-string, permitting low level \u201cribosomal rescue\u201d of the mutations and expression of some of the normal gene products. In the case of the drug-resistant mutant we have studied, it may be that this low level of TK expression was insufficient to activate ACV effectively but was sufficient for pathogenesis in a human, leading to selection of the mutant in the infected patient. Given that the G(7) string is a mutational hotspot, we predict that other ACV-resistant mutants associated with human disease will contain the same mutation. Study of other drug-resistant HSV tk mutants may identify different signals that allow relaxation of the constraints involved in reading frame maintenance.",

Lane 1, TK-wt (wild-type tk gene); lane 2, TK-4 (mutant tk gene); lane 3, TK-4a (mutant tk gene, except the recoding site sequence has been altered to correspond to that of BCH4a [Figure 1]); lane 4, TK-SL+ (mutant tk gene, except the HIV stem\u2013loop has been inserted downstream of the recoding site, i.e., to correspond to BCH4 [Figure 1]); lane 5, water control. M indicates molecular mass standards. White and black arrowheads indicate full-length or truncated species, respectively. The frameshift products from lanes 2 and 4 are 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively, relative to wild-type levels by densitometry. The multiple TK products observed (e.g., between A and B in lane 1 and below B in lane 2) are due primarily to translational initiation at internal AUG codons owing to leaky scanning (see Irmiere et al., 1989).",
