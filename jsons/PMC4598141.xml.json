In HIV, two major genes, gag and pol overlap by 205 nucleotides [7]. The downstream pol gene that encodes the protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase within a single polypeptide does not have its own initiation codon and is in a different reading frame (\u22121) relative to gag. A change in the reading frame (or frameshift) is required for the encoded information for these proteins to be translated. This leads to a gag-pol fusion polyprotein being synthesized dependent upon a \u22121 frameshifting event. Efficient programmed translational frameshifting requires two elements within the mRNA: a highly conserved slippery sequence (U UUU UUA) [8], and a downstream RNA stem-loop that enhances the efficiency of \u22121 frameshifting [7].",

Genetic variations in the frameshift element that reduce frameshifting by as little as 3-fold (that is, decrease the rate from 5\u201310% down to 2\u20133%) have profound defects on viral replication [10], and even more modest changes can reduce viral replication [11].

            "text": "When interest in \u22121 frameshifting mechanism as a potential drug target first arose there were no documented examples of specific human genes (or indeed any genes in the animal kingdom) that used the mechanism in their expression, but the human genome contains an evolutionary history of retroelement insertions, and there was potential for frameshifting in those now domesticated as functional human genes. Indeed the human developmental gene PEG10 (paternally expressed gene 10) undergoes \u22121 frameshifting [14]. Important for placental development [15], PEG10 is expressed 10 days post- conception in mouse placenta and amniotic membranes. Synthesis of the protein has not been found in adult tissues [14] but preliminary evidence has been obtained that the protein is also expressed in the hypothalamus [16], and the adrenal glands [17]. However, as yet we have no definitive evidence for frameshifting [16]. Another poorly characterized family of 15 human genes, MA/Pnma, has been determined to have retroelement ancestry, and two members have the potential for frameshifting, Ma3 and Ma5. The Ma3 frameshift element has been shown to support 20% frameshifting in vitro [18] but to date no evidence has been presented for its occurrence in vivo, or what function it might be supporting. Also more recently, the chemokine receptor CCR5 has been identified as a human gene that utilizes \u22121 frameshifting for fine tuning the regulation of its expression [19]. The new reading frame leads to a premature stop codon, initiating nonsense-mediated decay for destabilization of the mRNA. CCR5 frameshifting is stimulated by endogenous microRNAs, emphasizing the importance of screening in cells in vivo where endogenous modulators are functioning.",

For example, a screen of 56,000 compounds by Ribogene Inc. identified a compound RG501 (also known as DB213) that enhanced frameshifting leading to a 50% decrease in viral replication in vitro, although this compound was not a suitable candidate for use as a therapeutic agent [20].

This element was cloned between the same reporter genes to indicate whether inhibitory or stimulatory compounds were specific for the frameshift element or affected readthrough of nonsense mutations as well. We also tested effects on a purified Luc+ enzyme for a counter screen. An orthologous cell-based assay with fluorescent reporters was used to ensure effects of promising compounds were not related to the specific luciferase reporter assay. Finally we tested the effects of the most promising compounds on the frameshift efficiency of the human PEG10 frameshift element, to determine their specificity for HIV-1.",

Firstly the compounds were tested for toxicity for the host H9 cells at increasing concentrations and at the three time points (24, 48 and 72 h) that were used for the HIV-1 infection experiments, comparing with untreated cells, or those treated with AZT as a control. For two compounds, A1 and A3, the results were within the normal variability expected and there was no significant cytotoxicity, whereas the other compound A2 showed >25% toxicity at the highest concentration and so was put aside for this study. Then H9 cells were either infected with HIV-1 IIIB or uninfected as a control, and treated with enhancer compounds A1 and A3 (at 1, 5 and 20 \u03bcM) and a DMSO vehicle solvent control (0 \u03bcM) and cells were harvested at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h for analysis by Western immunoblot of gag protein (P24) expressed in the 0-frame, with specific antibody followed by the appropriate secondary antibody/detection reagent. The filter was then stripped and re-probed with anti-GAPDH for lane-to-lane normalization of the protein extract and consistency of immunoblot development. On a separate gel the protease enzyme in the \u22121-frame was detected using an anti-protease antibody together with appropriate secondary antibody. The filter was stripped and re-probed as before with anti-GAPDH for lane-to-lane normalization of protein extracts and consistency of immunoblot development. The intensity of the developed bands was digitized and quantitated, and the frameshift efficiency calculated at each time point for each compound and at each concentration, and for the DMSO vehicle control. These analytical data were normalized to variations of the GAPDH intensities, and compared with the DMSO control.",

This enabled the cloning of the HIV-1 frameshift element, and expression of the downstream reporter indicated a frameshift rate within the expected range of 5\u221210% with slight variation depending on the reporters used [27,36]. Two HIV frameshift elements were constructed, the wild-type slippery sequence, U UUU UUA, followed by GGG and the extended stem-loop [28], and a variant U UUC CUA that does not support frameshifting. For an additional control (0-frame), an A was inserted immediately 3\u2032 of the modified SS (ie U UUC CUA A), placing the downstream reporter in the 0-frame with respect to the upstream reporter. The cell lines expressing this sequence were used in counter screens to determine any off-target activity of the compounds being evaluated.

Frameshift enhancers like compound A1 showed increases in frameshifting with no apparent change in canonical protein synthesis up to 10 \u03bcM, as indicated by the upstream reporter (hRLuc) expression when the cells were assayed at 24 h after compound addition (Fig 3A green). The downstream reporter was not affected by these compounds when it was in the same frame as the upstream reporter (translation ratio 1.0) (Fig 3A red). This was reinforced separately by showing enhancer A1 did not modulate recombinant Luc+ enzyme activity. To ensure specificity for frameshifting, assays were employed to measure effects of the selected compounds on a different type of a genetic recoding site, the common UGA nonsense mutation W1282X found in the cystic fibrosis gene, CTFR [29]. As shown in Fig 3B enhancer A1 did not affect this different recoding event, either the readthrough of the UGA stop codon (green), or a UGG sense codon control at that site (red). As a positive control PTC124, the putative stop-codon readthrough enhancer, that is now known also to bind to and inhibit Luc+ enzymatic activity, was tested. The expected inhibition of Luc+ with increasing concentration of PTC124 [37] is reflected in Fig 3C (red) where there is an apparent decrease in the translation ratio of the sense codon control. This was confirmed directly by showing PTC124 decreased recombinant Luc+ activity. However, PTC124 enhanced readthrough of the UGA stop codon as expected when normalized against this sense codon control as shown in Fig 3C (green) and this effect was also dependent upon concentration. Collectively these data implied the enhancer A1 was a specific modulator of \u20131 frameshifting and did not affect the reporter enzymes or simply modulate ribosomal activity more generally.",

No significant effects were detected in this assay with the compounds found to enhance or inhibit frameshifting in the screen by ~2\u2013fold at 20 \u03bcM. This was not surprising as the ~2-fold fold change in frameshift efficiency was likely below the limit of change required to inhibit infectivity [13]. Improvement of these compounds is ongoing. To determine whether the same pattern and degree of modulation that had been obtained in the screening programme could be reproduced with HIV-1 proteins in the 0- and \u20131-frames, we tested the most promising enhancers in HIV-1 infected H9 cells. Following toxicity screens the effects on synthesis of the viral protease encoded in the \u22121-frame compared with the 0-frame gag structural protein were determined at three time points and three concentrations of the compounds. With each compound from 1\u221220 \u03bcM there was an increasing concentration-dependent enhancement of viral protease compared to gag protein (1.5\u22122.2 fold at 20 \u03bcM) compared with solvent control (Fig 5).

They are compared with the dual luciferase reporters also containing either of the two elements (Fig 6; HIV-1 above and PEG10 below). Each compound enhanced frameshifting of the HIV-1 element in both the bifluorescent and luciferase assays and to a similar extent in each reporter system (Fig 6 upper panel). In contrast to the results with the HIV-1 element, frameshifting at the PEG10 frameshift site was affected by only one of the compounds, A1, and was inhibited rather than enhanced with both reporter systems (Fig 6, lower panels).

These two human genes have themselves quite different frameshift elements with different functional consequences. Frameshifting has been identified in vivo after extensive studies with PEG10 [14,16]. The different slippery sequences, intercodons, and downstream secondary structures facilitated a frameshift efficiency that was ~2.5-fold higher for PEG10 than for HIV-1 (Fig 1). This is despite the fact that after \u22121 slippage the HIV-1 sequence can make two cognate codon/anticodon pairings [39] whereas slippage allows for only one cognate re-pairing in the PEG10 gene. The intercodon is highly conserved in HIV-1 [26], but substitution with a stop codon had a greater effect in PEG10 decreasing frameshifting 4\u20135-fold compared with 2\u20133-fold in HIV-1. With the HIV-1 element this can be further reduced by overexpressing the decoding molecule eRF1 and this can be explained as we identified frameshifting can occur at a site within the sequence element after the intercodon has been decoded (Fig 2). Hence with the substituted intercodon the 0-frame UGA would be decoded before frameshifting. By contrast PEG10 was insensitive to overexpession of eRF1, and it was shown to frameshift predominantly at two sites only in our heterologous system, both before the intercodon. There was however, suggestive evidence of a low frequency event after decoding of the intercodon (Table 1). Frameshifting at multiple sites with a frameshift element has recently been reported in the dnaX gene, and drop-off of incomplete polypeptides is inferred to occur from fidelity checks when the base pairing is non-cognate [40]. Such an outcome could contribute significantly to the large reduction in the output of the downstream reporter in the \u22121-frame in our PEG10 study when the UCC intercodon is substituted with UGA. Having only one rather than two cognate re-pairings on frameshifting might destabilize the complex, allowing a significant amount of drop-off and thereby reduced frameshift efficiency.",

Using specific purpose-based cell-based assays, in this study we have screened a large small molecule library that included compounds that are desirable starting points for further lead development. Several frameshift enhancers showed no activity against the 0-frame control element or in counter screens. A primary isolate from the screen and two analogues were tested also with bifluorescent reporters (Fig 6), and they mimicked the enhancement of frameshifting seen in the luciferase assays within the HIV-1 element (Fig 3A) indicating the observed activity was independent of the reporter set. These compounds also had no effect on readthrough of a nonsense codon at a different recoding site, the CFTR W1282X UGA nonsense mutation context, found in patients with cystic fibrosis (Fig 3B). The isolated enhancers in their current configuration did not give sufficient frameshift modulation to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity significantly in cell viability assays, but the synthesis of the protease enzyme in the \u22121-frame was enhanced ~2-fold by these compounds in HIV-1 infected cells relative to the 0-frame gag protein. While the minimum increase in frameshift ratio needed to inhibit infectivity is not known precisely, collective studies suggest it might be at least in the order of 3-fold. Hence further chemical modifications to the isolated compounds are needed to facilitate improvement in their efficacy and potency.",

            "text": "While programmed \u22121 translational frameshifting is a rare recoding event used mainly by viruses it has yet to be exploited as a therapeutic target. Now human genes are emerging that use the same generic mechanism. PEG10 protein expression with frameshifting has been documented only in placenta, in amniotic membranes and at low levels in embryos, and not observed in other tissues despite extensive analysis [14,16]. Here, we tested our isolated enhancer compounds on the PEG10 element. Two of the compounds A2 and A3 (Fig 6) that enhanced frameshifting with the HIV-1 element had no or little effect on PEG10 frameshifting. The other enhancer, A1, modestly inhibited PEG10 frameshifting in a concentration-dependent manner. This illustrates discovery of compounds specific for HIV-1 should be possible. Some frameshift modulators, depending on their mode of action might affect all frameshift sites however, and comprehensive testing of all human \u20131 frameshift sites is therefore important. The direct mechanism of action of the promising compounds we have identified is now being determined. Since they differentiate the HIV-1 and PEG10 elements that have quite different secondary structural components (stem-loop and pseudoknot) we predict they would likely target this part of the element. Nevertheless modulating compounds could target the coding RNA at the slippery sequence, or the secondary structural element, or indeed the active center of the host human translating ribosome that has a major function of maintaining the reading frame. The sites of interaction of the A1, A2 and A3 compounds with the HIV-1 frameshift element are currently being investigated.",
