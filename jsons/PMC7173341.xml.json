            "text": "In spring 2009, a novel influenza A causing acute respiratory illness was identified in North America (Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team 2009). In the United States, an estimated 60 million infections, 270,000 hospitalizations, and 12,270 deaths had been caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus as of mid-March 2010 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Rapid laboratory detection of pandemic A/H1N1 must rely upon detection with 1) direct fluorescent antigen testing; 2) rapid antigen or immunodiagnostic testing formats (RIDT); or 3) conventional or real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing (Storch, 2003). During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis was frequently obtained to help with the early initiation of antiviral therapy and the implementation of interventions by infection prevention and control. The 2009 H1N1 was the first pandemic influenza virus to be tested by many of the molecular diagnostic advances in medical microbiology since 1968. In order to evaluate the importance of obtaining rRT-PCR as the first-line diagnostic test for detecting 2009 H1N1, we studied 426 NP swab specimens by RIDT and 3 different PCR-based detection methods, including a laboratory-developed rRT-PCR assay (LDT rRT-PCR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2009 H1N1 rRT-PCR protocol, and the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) (xTAG RVP).",

Viral RNA detection by PCR is described by the WHO as the method of choice for the detection of 2009 H1N1 virus infection (WHO, 2009b). The use of rRT-PCR testing permits the highest sensitivity for the detection of influenza in respiratory specimens and uniquely allows for the specific identification of the influenza A 2009 H1N1. RIDTs have been widely adopted because they are rapid, convenient, and require less expertise to perform. As a consequence, a great deal of attention has been placed on the accuracy of RIDT for detecting 2009 H1N1. RIDT has been previously demonstrated to have a lower sensitivity than RT-PCR in the detection of seasonal influenza, often ranging from 41% to 87% depending on the prevalence, specimen type, and age of the patient (Liao et al., 2009). The analytical sensitivities of several RIDT assays have been shown to be comparable between 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza H1N1 (Chan et al., 2009). The clinical sensitivity for the 2009 H1N1 virus was reported to be 11\u201370% (Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, 2010) or, compared with only RT-PCR as the reference, in the range of 45\u201363% when 30 positive specimens were included (Karre, 2010, Velasco, 2010, Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, 2010). Similar to these findings, the Binax NOW FluA/B RIDT in this study had a sensitivity of 42.3% compared to PCR (Table 1). The low negative predictive value of RIDT for influenza A has serious implications for the continued reliance of RIDT as the first-line diagnostic test for influenza when a laboratory diagnosis is required for patient management. This observation agrees with the consensus that a negative result should not be used to make decisions with respect to treatment or infection prevention (Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, 2010).",

These findings highlight the importance of accurate laboratory testing to support the diagnoses of patients with signs and symptoms of influenza. The xTAG RVP has a valuable capability to detect novel influenza A virus strains and it was utilized during the early months of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic before an H1N1 2009\u2013specific PCR could be validated.",

The protocol for the CDC H1N1 rRT-PCR assay which has been distributed worldwide by the World Health Organization is published to be compatible with a diverse number of different instruments, but each laboratory needs to thoroughly validate its in-house performance.",
