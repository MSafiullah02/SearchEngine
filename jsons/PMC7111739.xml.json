            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2003, Drosten et al., 2003). The illness is characterized by inflammatory exudation in the alveoli and interstitial tissue accompanied by hyperplasia of fibrous tissues and fibrosis (Nicholls et al., 2003). Destruction of lung tissue is thought to result from an over-exuberant immune response rather than from the direct effects of viral replication. Particularly, it has been shown that IFN-\u03b3 may be activated in SARS patients (Wong et al., 2004; Cameron M.J. International Conference on SARS, Lubeck, May 8\u201311, 2004), suggesting that proinflammatory cytokines may be associated with lung infiltration and proliferation of lymphomononuclear cells (Nicholls et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2004, Bauer et al., 2000, Beijing Group of National Research Project for SARS, 2003). Another clinical feature of SARS is leukopenia (Wong et al., 2003) which may be consequent to the recruitment of lymphomonocytes from the periphery to the inflamed tissue. A short time after the onset of the disease, the presence of the replicative intermediates of SARS-CoV has been shown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) taken from patients (Li et al., 2003). In addition, SARS-CoV genome replication has been detected in PBMC in vitro (Ng et al., 2004), and low titers of infectious progeny production have been observed in cultures of purified monocyte/macrophage (Yilla et al., 2005). Minute and variable amounts of IFN-\u03b1  have been detected in these cultures, suggesting a potential role of this cytokine in restricting SARS-CoV replication in monocytes in vitro. Recently, both macrophages (m\u03d5) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) have been shown to be unable to sustain productive replication of SARS-CoV, although initial phases of virus replication cycle have been detected in the latter cells (Tseng et al., 2005, Law et al., 2005).",

The levels of IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 mRNA in the cells and the corresponding cytokine levels in the supernatants were measured. The results of a representative experiments are shown in Fig. 1\nand indicated that SARS-CoV is able to induce both IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, being MOI 10 the most effective (Fig. 1a). In addition, IFN-\u03b1 mRNA levels reached a peak after 24 h, whereas IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels were steadily increasing at 48 h of culture (Fig. 1c). The dose-dependence and the kinetics of IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 release in the supernatants, shown in Figs. 1b and d, were consistent with the mRNA results. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24\u201348 h.p.i. (Fig. 1d) and remained rather stable up to day 4 p.i., then started to decline thereafter (not shown). The response to SARS-CoV infection was consistently found in PBMC from different donors, although with great variation in the extent of response. To give an idea of this variation, individual results from 4 different donors, referring to one representative time and dose, are shown in Figs. 1e and g (for mRNA) and Figs. 1f and h (for immunoreactive cytokines). The stimulation of IFN response to SARS-CoV was observed in all experiments, but, as can be seen, the extent of response for mRNA varied from 3 to 45 stimulation over background and was even more pronounced when measuring cytokine levels by ELISA. The overall pattern of variation was not concordant for mRNA and ELISA at individual PBMC level, suggesting that it did not merely reflect the different activation state of PBMC from different donors.",

In Fig. 2a, the infectious virus concentration in PBMC infected at the various MOI is shown. A decreasing amount of infectious virus was observed along the whole study period, probably resulting from thermal inactivation of residual viral inoculum, suggesting the absence of newly formed progeny yield. Similar results were also obtained with mitogen (phytohemoagglutinin, PHA)-activated PBMC (not shown). To test if at least part of the virus replication cycle took place in PBMC, we measured the levels of both virus-specific minus-RNA strand and genomic RNA. A peak of minus-RNA strand could be visualized only at low MOI 0.1 due to high background in the inoculum at higher MOI, whereas genomic RNA quantification revealed a trend similar to infectious virus yield titration, with a decreasing residual inoculum detected along the whole observation period (not shown). To lower the background noise at high MOI, we repeated the infection experiments in PBMC from 3 additional donors and performed trypsinization and extensive washing of the cells after the adsorbtion phase. Under these conditions, we could clearly appreciate a peak of minus strand viral RNA in 3 out of 3 PBMC samples, ranging from 50- to 250-fold increase over background levels. In two PBMC samples, the peak was observed at day 1 p.i., while in one PBMC sample, it was observed at day 2 p.i. followed by a decline to background levels thereafter in all 3 cases. Fig. 2c shows one representative case. However, also in these conditions, no increase of either infectivity or genomic RNA could be appreciated, as shown in Figs. 2b and c. No damage of PBMC apparently occurred in such cultures, as assessed as both overall mortality and apoptotic cell death (never exceeding the background levels of 5\u20136%). These results suggested the occurrence of an incomplete virus replication cycle in PBMC.",

To this aim, normal PBMC were cocultivated with fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells at different ratios (from 6:1 to 200:1). Fixed uninfected Vero cells were used as negative control. Fig. 3\nshows the results of a representative dose- and time-dependence experiment. As can be seen, both IFN types were dose-dependently induced by the fixed SARS-CoV-infected cells. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b1 release peaked at day 1, remaining at plateau levels thereafter, whereas IFN-\u03b3  reached plateau levels at 48 h.p.i. only with the highest concentration of the inducer, while it was still increasing at this time at lower inducer concentrations. Similar results were obtained with PBMC from different donors, although with some variability in the extent of response. In fact, range for peak IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 levels were 800\u20132500 and 200\u20132000, respectively (not shown). On the whole, the IFN response was higher than that observed in the experiments using live virus since average cytokine levels were about 2- and 5-fold higher for IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3, respectively.",

In this study, we extended the observations to the recently discovered etiologic agent of SARS, obtaining evidence that SARS-CoV has the intrinsic ability to activate both IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 gene expression in PBMC cultures. In fact, we observed a dose- and time-dependent induction of both mRNA and protein release for both cytokines when using live virus as IFN inducer in normal PBMC cultures. Recently, SARS-CoV antigens have been shown to be able to induce a recall response, including the production of IFN-\u03b3, in PBMC from vaccinated mice (Takasuka et al., 2004), but, to our knowledge, there were no previous data showing IFN-\u03b3 response to SARS-CoV by unprimed human PBMC.",

However, the levels of cytokines in the supernatants showed a similar pattern for both IFN types, being stable for up to 4 days.

            "text": "Concerning the first line of evidence, the present study adds significant advancement to previous data. In fact, recent results from another group indicated that SARS-CoV is able to infect in vitro PBMC and to determine virus-specific RNA production (Ng et al., 2004). However, infectious viral yield was not tested in this paper. Here, we show that, under our experimental conditions, productive viral replication does not occur in PBMC, although initial phases of virus infection take place. In fact, both viral infectivity and genomic RNA progressively decreased along the observation time. Even after removal of background levels by trypsinization, we failed to detect any increase of both infectious progeny yield and genomic RNA. However, removal of background noise allowed us to consistently detect a peak of newly formed negative strand at day 1 or 2 p.i., declining thereafter. These findings suggest that, under these conditions, initial phases of virus replication started in PBMC, but the cycle did not progress to completion. No damage of PBMC apparently occurred in such cultures, as assessed as both overall mortality and apoptotic cell death, further supporting the absence of virus replication in bulk PBMC cultures. These results remind what has been observed in two recent studies in blood mononuclear cell cultures (Tseng et al., 2005, Law et al., 2005). Particularly, in the study by Tseng et al., the infectious virus titer progressively decreased, and viral subgenomic RNA was not produced in primary m\u03d5 or monocyte-derived DC. The authors conclude that in these cells SARS-CoV fails to establish productive infection, although affecting some functions of both cell types (Tseng et al., 2005). Similarly, Law et al. did not observe production of infectious virus yield in DC, although initial phases of viral replication seemed to occur (Law et al., 2005).",
