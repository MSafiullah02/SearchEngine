            "text": "This study aims to explore the impact of healthcare digitalization on smart hospital project financing (PF) fostered by pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives. Digital platforms are a technology-enabled business model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents. They represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the scalable value of networks. Application to healthcare public-private partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder's interaction. In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players cooperate, usually following PF patterns. This relationship is complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly patient-centric. This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the cost-benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. Whereas diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with long-term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent costs. \"Digital\" savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P schemes, incentivizing value co-creation patterns. Efficient sharing may apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding nodes are digitally connected. This innovative approach improves stakeholder relationships, which are re-engineered around digital platforms that enhance patient-centered satisfaction and sustainability. Digital technologies are useful even for infectious disease surveillance, like that of the coronavirus pandemic, for supporting massive healthcare intervention, decongesting hospitals, and providing timely big data. not due to population aging per se, but to the increase in demand for new medical technologies that improve and/or extend life as real per-capita incomes grow [3, 4] .",

The relationship between medical technology and spending is complex and often conflicting. The impact of technology on costs differs across technologies, in that some (e.g., cancer drugs, invasive medical devices) have significant financial implications, while others are cost-neutral or cost-saving [7] . Medicine in the 21 st century is increasingly dependent on technology. Unlike in many other areas, the cost of medical technology is not declining, and its increasing use contributes to spiraling healthcare costs. Many medical professionals equate progress in medicine to the growing use of sophisticated technology, which is often expensive and beyond the reach of the average citizen [8] .",

Digital healthcare is a major driver of innovation, growth, and competitiveness. Digital technology is reported to reduce healthcare costs by 7 to 11 percent [9,10]. Cashless (digital) payment savings account for 0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) [11] . To the extent that GDP can roughly be assimilated to revenue, and considering an incidence of some 80% of operating costs (EBIT/revenues), the estimated operating cost reduction due to cashless payments is around 0.4%. An international comparison of health prices across countries can improve the private competition for international public-private partnership (PPP) tenders [12] .",

The increasing pace of change in healthcare technologies and policies has generated increased interest in the future adaptability of the physical infrastructure that supports health services [17] . Technological investments are often made possible by public-private cooperation within healthcare PPP agreements backed by project finance (PF) patterns. The introduction of health information technologies (HIT) increases organizational performance, including productivity enhancement and cost reductions. HIT can contribute to hospital profitability, for instance, by reducing paper chart pulling and document transportation, reducing medical errors, and potentially lowering medical liability costs as well as decreasing back-office expenses [18, 19] . These technological advances hence contribute to making the model sustainable and profitable for all the stakeholders.",

A corollary aspect is represented by the (optimal) public-private-patient sharing of savings with P4P schemes. The methodology also contains an outline of the investigation area and a description of the consequential reasoning that it brings to the empirical case. Section 4 analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks that are part of the study background, and whose softening is an ancillary component of the motivation and purpose of the paper. Section 5 addresses specific solutions to some healthcare bottlenecks, through an analysis of value co-creation patterns based on digital health platforms. Digitalization and networking of key stakeholders will be analyzed as an ideal interactive background for these solutions. Section 6 analyzes the cost-benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. The economic and financial impact of digitalization will be tested with a sensitivity analysis on a sample of healthcare PPP investments. The discussion (Section 7) and the conclusions (Section 8) critically examine and summarize the main findings. Some policy implications (P4P sharing of digital savings; impact of digitalization on PPP contracts) will be analyzed, together with practical recommendations and tips for further research.",

Eighty-five percent of general medical doctors (81% of specialized doctors) use email to communicate with patients (64% of general doctors and 57% of specialized doctors use WhatsApp). Online booking is used by 11% of patients and 7% pay online. A total of 41% of citizens use wearables, smartwatches, or other devices to monitor their health. Image diagnostics is digitalized in 88% of cases (86% of lab analyses). Digital apps are widely used in radiology (84%), but less in ultrasound (40%), ECG/EEG (33%), or digital pathology apps (7%). The use of mobile applications (m-apps), blogs, or online health searches for information is continuously growing. eProcurement of digital solutions is still a bottleneck due to insufficient awareness of its potential and to legal obstacles. More comprehensive application of digital health in Italy may substantially improve the quality of life of some 24 million people (40% of the population) that suffer from chronic diseases.

This template can be easily extended to other international cases, since PPP initiatives like those considered here show consistent similarities. This is due also to European legislation, according to which big EU tenders are open to international competitors that require standard rules. The basic model is therefore easily generalizable to other healthcare PPP investments.

First, the supply chain bottlenecks that increase costs and reduce efficiency, productivity, and value for money, exemplified in Table 1 for the peculiar healthcare case, need to be tailor-made for other occurrences that are typically very different. Additionally, the economic and financial plan, exemplified in Table 2 (and with a detail of opex items in Table 3 ), needs careful personalization, reflecting the nature of heterogeneous business plans.

Only time will tell, even if the insights of this study may help conception of an innovative legal context where digital savings can be equitably shared.
