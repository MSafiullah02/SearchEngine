These systems may vary from the most simple one, i.e. the counting of new cases (numerical system) to a somewhat more informative one in which name and age of patients are also noted (nominative system). In more extensive information-notification systems further data of epidemiological value may be included, such as the suspected source and place of infection, data on the onset of disease, occurrence of other similar cases etc. All reporting systems have their weaknesses and have to be evaluated with great caution and by persons who are aware of the limitations. A low incidence may be due to a poor reporting system; conversely, an improvement of a reporting system may give a false impression of an increase in the number of cases.",

It should be emphasized that healthy infected individuals are a relatively more important source of infection than diseased bed-ridden individuals and, further, that diseased individuals frequently spread large quantities of virus either before the appearance of overt symptoms or during the prodromal phase of disease. The incubation period for viral diseases varies from between a few days and many months. In these days of extensive international travelling it is a fact that within the incubation period of most viral diseases any part of our world may be reached. Consequently, a broader spectrum of viral diseases is now being encountered, in particular in industrialized countries. A broader assortment of available methods for the laboratory diagnosis of imported virus infections therefore is required in these countries.",

Respiratory infections may spread by aerosol. However, the importance of this route of transmission probably is overrated. Instead, spread of infected mucosal secretion from mouth-nose via hand (object) may play a dominating role. In special cases infected saliva may spread the infection in connection with kissing, for example, EBV in teenagers, or biting, for example rabies from a dog or other animal. Gastrointestinal infections spread from stool via hand or contaminated water. An example of the latter situation is hepatitis A; the virus may be excreted into sewage water for more than a week before the appearance of disease and this virus may accumulate in clams, for example, and spread via the ingestion of contaminated seafood. Swimming pools are another potential source of water-borne virus infections.",

That the urogenital tract may be an important source of virus infections has become inreasingly apparent only recently. Urine may be contaminated with viruses, for example large quantities of CMV is excreted by children with urogenital disease. However, the presence of viruses in secretions or blood in the genital tract probably plays a much larger role than virus-contaminated urine in the spread of infections. Sexual transmission can be a vehicle for herpes simplex virus type 2, hepatitis B, CMV and other infections. Transmission of virus via infected blood is seen in the case of hepatitis B and non-A and non-B hepatitis from transfusions or contaminated needles and syringes and, inevitably, in the wide spectrum of infections spread by vectors such as mosquitos, ticks, etc. Infected skin is the origin of the spread by contact for infections caused by poxviruses, some herpesviruses (HSV, varicella) and papillomaviruses. A final route of transmission to be mentioned is the vertical (transplacental) spread of virus from a pregnant woman to the fetus.",

            "text": "The third prerequisite for the continued spread of infections is the availability of susceptible hosts. Some virus infections induce an immunity of limited duration. This pertains to certain local infections in the respiratory tract and probably also in the gastroenteric tract. In this case repeated infections may occur. However, it is a characteristic feature of most generalized virus infections that they induce a highly efficient immunity which confers a lifelong protection against disease. Local reinfections without symptoms may occur in the immune individuals, but these limited infections probably do not represent a source of further spread of infection. With epidemics of generalized virus disease, for example measles, there is an accumulation of immune individuals. When a certain fraction of the population is immune the further spread of an infection, which is dependent on a chain of transmission between acutely infected individuals, is restrained. The percentage of the population which needs to be immune to establish this herd immunity varies for different viruses. In the case of a highly contagious virus like measles it has been shown to exceed 90 per cent. The size of a population and the frequency of contact between individuals also influence the possibilities for maintaining a continued, and most of the time, low-grade, endemic spread of infections. It has been found that under conditions prevailing in industrialized countries a population in excess of 300 000 is required to allow a continued circulation of measles virus. Thus in a country like Iceland measles epidemics will \u2018burn out\u2019. New epidemics will occur provided that a sufficient number of non-immune individuals have accumulated and the virus is reintroduced into the society from without.",

In order to reach this goal it was not found necessary to establish a herd immunity in populations in all countries. Instead it was experienced that the chain of transmission of disease could be effectively interrupted by vaccination of individuals in the surrounding areas of the infected population, a technique referred to as containment measures.\n",

The nomenclature used for classification of the different influenza virus variants include identification of the serotype A, B or C, the place where the strain was first isolated and its H and N characters. The PR8 variant from the 1930s was named A/PR8/34 (HON1). In the years 1947 to 1956 a variant with the H and N characters H1N1 prevailed. In 1957 a new extensive pandemic wave started, the \u2018Asiatic flu\u2019 caused by influenza A/Asia/57 (H2N2), and in 1968 there was again an antigenic shift to influenza A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2). The most likely explanation of the occurrence of antigenic shifts in influenza virus is a genetic reassortment in connection with a simultaneous infection of cells with a human and animal influenza A virus.

The most important cases of fetal damage caused by such a transmission are congenital rubella and CMV infections (see\nChapter 15). From the epidemiological point of view it is of importance that children with these congenital diseases are excreting virus for periods of months to years after birth. The paradoxical effect \u2013 that a pregnancy causes a physiological immunosuppression which leads to activation of some latent infections \u2013 should also be mentioned. One example is activated CMV infections. This virus can be isolated from 4 per cent of pregnant women at the time of delivery. However, in terms of fetal damage, primary infections with CMV appear to play a major role.",

It was revealed that the causative agent was likely to have been transmitted in connection with funeral rituals. The practising of these rituals ceased in 1957 and no person born after that year has developed the disease. However, cases of kuru still appear. The routes of natural transmission of Jakob\u2013Creutzfeld disease, which is the equivalent of kuru in countries other than New Guinea, are unknown. Clusters of cases at various times and locations have been encountered, but the source of infection has not been detected. Certain cases of Jakob\u2013Creutzfeld disease may be due to intrafamiliar spread. In a few cases transmission in connection with medical interventions has been identified.",

At least 50 different haemorrhagic fevers have been categorized, mainly from tropical areas (see\nChapter 26). Yellow fever is the most wellknown disease. In Europe tick-borne encephalitis of eastern and Scandinavian types are prevalent. The reservoirs are wild and domestic animals. Characteristics of this kind of disease are the endemicity and, in temperate climates, seasonal appearance. The epidemiology of these diseases is determined by a complex interaction between factors such as infected animals, environment, climate, season and immunity. From the epidemiological point of view zoonotic infections in man in most cases represent a blind alley, i.e. no further spread of infection to other individuals can occur. The only exception is second- and occasionally third-generation spread of Ebola\u2013Marburg virus infections to relatives and hospital personnel from close contact with patients under primitive conditions. The risk of transfer to laboratory personnel in connection with analysis of samples from patients with these kinds of rare diseases, including Lassa fever, should be appreciated.",
