            "text": "Numerous anthropogenic factors have been implicated in the decline of LPCHs. Conversion of native grassland communities to cropland, fire suppression leading to juniper (Juniperus spp.) encroachment, excessive grazing by livestock, suburban developments, and fossil-fuel drilling and exploring are suspected to be the primary factors (Giesen 1998 , Woodward et al. 2001 . These factors, coupled with periodic drought, may have driven long-term population lows to critical levels. Continued human encroachment and overgrazing likely will exacerbate population declines. Management guidelines have been published for sage grouse (Centrocercus spp.) and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (T. phasianellus columbianus), species of conservation concern (Braun et al. 1977 , Giesen and Connelly 1993 , Connelly et al. 2000 , but not for LPCHs. We provide a synopsis of the current state of knowledge and provide guidelines to monitor, maintain, and enhance LPCH populations and the habitats upon which they depend. Lesser prairie-chickens occupy 3 distinct vegetative communities; however, data are available primarily for populations inhabiting sand shinnery oak and sand sagebrush communities, and our guidelines reflect the available information.",

In Kansas, Jamison (2000) estimated annual survival of radiomarked males to be 57%. Male and female 6-month survival curves (April-September) that included breeding and nesting were 74%, and this estimate extrapolated to 12 months=55%.

However, movements of LPCHs in southwest Kansas resembled partial migrations; approximately 5% of radiomarked individuals moved 30-50 km from their capture areas during nesting or postnesting and returned to the capture area during winter (Hagen 2003) . Prenesting (spring) ranges tended to be larger for females (355-596 ha) than spring ranges for males (120-211 ha) in Colorado and Kansas (Giesen 1998 , Jamison 2000 , Walker 2000 . In Colorado the combined annual ranges (95% ellipses) of all birds, males and females, from a lek were 2,450-5,130 ha (24.5-51.3 km 2 ) (Giesen 1998) . In Kansas summer ranges (95% fixed-kernel) generally were smaller than spring ranges for both males (120 ha) and females (150 ha) (Jamison 2000) . Lesser prairiechickens in New Mexico and Oklahoma moved considerable distances in years of drought, but prenesting, nesting, and postnesting ranges of females had patterns similar to those of Colorado and Kansas, although they were slightly smaller (Copelin 1963 , Riley et al. 1994 . Winter ranges of male LPCHs in Kansas were 300-700 ha (Jamison 2000) and 331-1,945 ha in Texas (Taylor and Guthery 1980a) . These enlarged ranges have been attributed to foraging in grain fields, which may be some distance from winter loafing and roosting sites in native rangeland (Taylor and Guthery 1980a) .",

Mechanical shrub removal is uncommon in habitats typically occupied by LPCH; therefore, no data are available on the effects of brush-beating on the species. Effects of shrub-specific herbicides on LPCHs probably are compounded by interactions with livestock grazing, size of treated area, and resulting herbaceous cover (Jamison et al. 2002a ). Herbicide treatment kills shrubs and allows an increase in grass cover if grass cover is not reduced by heavy grazing (Donaldson 1966 , Doerr and Guthery 1983 , Olawsky 1987 , Olawsky and Smith 1991 . There are no data that demonstrate how herbicides can be used to create an interspersion of different vegetation types or that any herbicide treatments will increase survival or recruitment of LPCHs. Negative effects of herbicide treatment on shrub cover may not become evident until >3 years following herbicide applications as the treated shrubs fall and decay (Rodgers and Sexson 1990, Jamison et al. 2002a) .",

Overgrazing is a major reason for declines in numbers of LPCHs because of degradation to nesting habitat (Taylor and Guthery 1980b , Leslie et al. 1999 , Mote et al. 1999 . However, few data demonstrate the mechanisms by which grazing impacts LPCH demography. In sandy soils heavy grazing may result in a shortage of the tall residual cover (Berg et al. 1997, Sims and Gillen 1999) required for successful nesting (Hoffman 1963 , Jackson and DeArment 1963 , Litton et al. 1994 , and in firmer soils grazing may result in conversion of tall-and mid-grass communities to a shortgrass-dominated community (Quinn and Walgenbach 1990) . Alternatively, moderate grazing in sandy regions can yield greater basal cover of mid-grasses and forbs (Quinn and Walgenbach 1990, Sims and Gillen 1999) that may be beneficial to both nesting success and brood rearing, respectively. In Oklahoma, Copelin (1963) noted that LPCHs used moderately grazed pastures more frequently than heavily grazed pastures. In New Mexico, LPCHs used lightly grazed habitats during drought years but were able to use more heavily grazed habitats in years of near-average precipitation (Merchant 1982) .",

In Texas displaying males abandoned one lek after an elevated road was built across it (Crawford and Bolen 1976b) . Power lines placed near leks may negatively affect breeding activity of males (C. A. Hagen, unpublished data) as raptors perching and hunting from these poles may result in reduced lekking activity. Acoustical disturbance (noise pollution) from oil or gas pumps also may affect lekking displays. Proposed windpower-generation farms also may increase visual fragmentation of rangeland and cause abandonment of lekking sites. Pitman (2003) reported that females selected nest sites in southwestern Kansas that were significantly farther from anthropogenic features (e.g., power lines, pump-jacks, improved roads, and buildings) associated with energy development than expected at random (Table 4 ). Hagen (2003) found that areas used by radiomarked male and nonnesting-female LPCHs were significantly farther from these same features than areas not used by LPCHs (Table 4 ). These studies indicated that LPCHs likely would use less-disturbed areas even though vegetation composition or structure may be similar between used and unused sites. Much research is needed to determine the effects of energy exploration and development on LPCHs.",

(2002) documented the first incidence of infectious bronchitis (a coronavirus) antibodies in LPCHs. If a coronavirus should become widespread in a population, the effects could be devastating, and Peterson et al. (2002) urged that further work be conducted to assess the prevalence of coronaviruses in LPCHs. Robel et al. (2003) reported the presence of helminthic parasites of Tetrameres spp. (stomach worm), Oxyspirura petrowi (eye worm), and Subulura spp. (caecal worm) in 92, 95, and 59% of LPCH carcasses (n= 93), respectively. Alternatively, incidence was lower in fecal samples of radiomarked individuals (n=46 parasitized birds, n=52 nonparasitized birds), but the presence of helminths did not measurably affect body mass, clutch size, nesting success, daily movements, or survival of radiomarked LPCHs (Robel et al. 2003) .",

Identifying and prioritizing target areas will facilitate better field management and working relationships with private landowners, thus creating a framework for ensuring connectivity throughout a management zone. Concentrating habitat restoration and management efforts in target areas will ensure that funding and personnel resources are used efficiently. Given the fragmented nature of LPCH habitat, management zones will encompass large areas of unsuitable habitat (Figure 3 ). Identifying target areas where habitat restoration, management, and population monitoring are the most efficacious will facilitate protection and creation of large habitat blocks and maintain adequate levels of connectivity ( Figure 3 ). These target areas should be ranked for management action based on existing habitat quality and quantity, LPCH populations, and the potential for LPCH to expand into a target area.",

Maintain or increase shrub cover in sand sagebrush communities (particularly in areas where taller species of grass have been reduced by grazing practices). Manage grazing to maintain adequate height (>25 cm) and density of residual grasses and forbs. Consider fencing areas (>1.6 km 2 ) to prevent grazing during the nesting season; because breeding females generally space their nests to avoid predation pressure, fencing small areas will not provide nesting cover for significant numbers of females. Evaluate the feasibility of predator removal efforts to enhance nesting success of imperiled populations in small areas (<2,000 ha) of habitat (Bergerud 1988, Schroeder and Baydack 2001) . Predator removal can increase nest success of prairie grouse (Lawrence and Silvy 1995) and other ground-nesting birds (Garretson et al. 1996 , Witmer et al. 1995 , but long-term intensive management may not be economical. Passive predator management, through relaxation of restrictions on harvest, take, or opportunistic gunning of certain furbearers, should be considered within the boundaries of management zones. Nesting habitats should be interspersed with brood habitats to facilitate easier movements of young broods between habitats and reduce predation or starvation rates (Bergerud 1988 , Pitman 2003 .",

Experimental spring burns could be conducted at sites recently abandoned by LPCHs but adjacent to areas still inhabited. Conserve shinnery oak motts and protect oak bud, mast, and catkin production in relatively mesic shinnery oak communities by discing firebreaks around motts, and avoid annual burning of large areas to conserve residual nesting cover (Boyd and Bidwell 2001, Harrell et al. 2001) . Alternatively, burning may be an advantageous tool to reduce juniper (Wright 1974) or mesquite (Prosopis spp.) encroachment (Harrell et al. 2001) .

To achieve this heterogeneity, grazing systems must incorporate periods of rest to prevent excessive grazing. Because excessive grazing yields lower-quality concealment cover and reduces foraging habitat (particularly for nesting and brood rearing) continuous grazing is not recommended (Bidwell 2003) . Alternatively, we recommend light or moderate grazing that will ensure 60-70% of key herbaceous species (Holochek et al. 1989 ) will be available as residual nesting cover (Berg et al. 1997 , Snyder 1997 , Sims and Gillen 1999 . At least 20-30% of a pasture should be rested completely in rotations of about once every 3-5 years Engle 2001, Bidwell 2003) , and this vegetative response can be maintained using patch-burning methods in which 20-30% of an area is burned annually (Bidwell 2003) . Livestock preferentially graze recently burned patches, leaving the remaining 70-85% in various successional stages. No data are available on the effects of deferred grazing systems (which postpone grazing until grassland plants have matured) or rest-rotation grazing systems (which involve multiple pastures through which livestock are rotated) on LPCH populations, but appropriate use of these systems probably would create suitable interspersion of different vegetation heights (Manely et al. 1997) . Large pastures and fewer livestock water sources also will result in a diversity of grazing pressures at the landscape level. We suggest an adaptive grazing strategy that would adjust stocking rates and season of use based on grazing system and annual precipitation. One such adap-tive framework would allocate different levels of livestock grazing based on the previous 12 months' precipitation. This system would allow the rancher to manage the operation more effectively with few surprises.",

However, if herbicides must be used, we recommend that such treatments not reduce sand sagebrush or shinnery oak to less than 25% of the canopy within one year after treatment. Shrub removal treatments should create a mosaic of treated and untreated areas to provide an interspersion of vegetative structures dominated by grasses and shrubs for nesting cover and areas with a diversity of vegetation for brood rearing, foraging, and adult autumn and winter cover. To create a mosaic of vegetative structures, apply tebuthiuron in strips <10 m wide at rates of 0.2-0.4 kg/ha. Such treatments should be applied with a tractor-mounted sprayer (Snyder 1997) . Preserve small (<10-ha) motts of tall shinnery oak that produce mast crops by excluding these areas from herbicide applications. Treat shrubs in contour strips on a 10year rotation to provide suitable interspersion of nesting and brood-rearing habitats while reducing wind erosion of sandy soils (Jamison et al. 2002a) . Avoid annual chemical brush treatment of large areas because this may reduce LPCH production (Wiedenfeld et al. 2001) . Woody vegetation >3 m in height also should be thinned using mechanical methods when possible. Similar protocols should be followed with mechanical treatment of LPCH habitat to ensure that a mosaic of habitats is provided.",

In the interim, surveys that attempt to count all leks in areas known to be occupied, where occurrence is likely, and that may be restored should be implemented by wildlife and natural resource agencies rangewide (Davison 1940, Hamerstrom and Hamerstrom 1973) . This should include surveying known leks and potential sites at least 3 times during the peak of breeding (approximately 21 March-21 April) and between the 30 minutes before and no later than 1 hour after sunrise (Crawford and Bolen 1975) , on days with wind <16 km/hr and no precipitation.",

Lek surveys may provide an index to the size of the breeding population and may detect long-term changes in policy or land use that impact LPCH populations (Beck and Braun 1980) . In the absence of mark-recapture studies and harvest information (sex and age ratios), lek surveys are the primary method of estimating minimum spring breeding populations. In states where LPCHs are hunted, age ratios are difficult to estimate, given the low harvest rates and the trophy status of the species (i.e., hunters probably are not willing to contribute wings or other parts).",
