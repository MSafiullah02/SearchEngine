Since TCR CDR3 analysis visualizes objectively every alteration in the TCR composition, it may be helpful to define new markers of disease activity in autoimmune diseases; it may also present a potential matrix to gauge immuno-suppressive effects of novel drugs. For instance, TCR diversity has been suggested as a readout in PBL from patient suffering from SLE (39) , or in the synovial fluid from patients with RA (40) and TCR CDR3 analysis suggested that the T-cell infiltrates in patients with Crohn's disease are indicative of an antigen-driven process (41) . Recently, TCR CDR3 analysis supported the notion that T-cells play a major role in mediating inflammation in patients with MS (42, 43) or in patients with Guillain-Barre and Fisher syndrome (44) and shed light on the association of psoriatic lesions and joint inflammation (45) as well as a certain form of polymyositis and HTLV-infection (46) . In addition, TCR CDR3 analysis may be helpful to appreciate the TCR repertoire of individuals with exposure to defined pathogens. For instance, TCR CDR3 analysis in HIV+ and HIV negative men, but with 'high-risk-exposure to the pathogen showed that -in general -high antigenic exposure is associated with a restricted T-cell repertoire (47) . This underlines the need to select appropriate control populations if the TCR repertoire is compared to 'healthy controls'.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 967, "end": 971, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1025, "text": "(40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1167, "text": "(41)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1300, "text": "(42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1304, "text": "43)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1364, "text": "(44)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1513, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1856, "text": "(47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "In search of a culprit"}, {"text": "Comprehensive reports may include (for CD4 / CD8-sorted T-cells) the following data: Data acquisition and data analysis.
