ORFs 1a and 1b comprise more than 75% of the genome, and encode for enzymes responsible for viral replication (non-structural proteins). ORF2a, and ORFs 3\u20135 are coding the membrane associated glycoproteins; ORF2b and ORF6 are encoding the nonglycosilated membrane proteins and the ORF7 codes for the nucleocapsid protein (Meulenberg, 2000, Wu et al., 2001).",

The latter is the keypoint of this assay, since PRRSV is one of the most variable and rapidly evolving RNA viruses. In a TaqMan assay when mismatch is present in the probe binding site, the probe is displaced rather than hydrolysed, and the quencher molecule remains in the close proximity of the reporter. This can lead to signal loss, reduced sensitivity, and possible false negative results. For the PriProET reaction a 5\u2032 exonulcease deficient enzyme is used for the polymerisation that will prevent the hydrolysis or displacement of the probe offering more stable fluorescence signal.",

The PriProET assay uses only one primer-probe set to detect the full range of strains of both genotypes by tolerating numerous mutations on the target-probe area. By using fewer oligonucleotides in the reaction mixture it will be less prone to primer and primer-probe dimerisation and aspecific annealing leading to loss of fluorescence signal and sensitivity. The T overhang added to the oligonucleotides on their labelled enhanced the level of the fluorescence signal during the reactions, thus increasing the sensitivity of the system. Previous results obtained with the reverse primer and probe without the overhang showed significant lower fluorescence. The possible explanation of this phenomenon is that since T is the smallest nucleotide, it causes weaker quencher effect then the others, enhancing both the FRET and the light emission of the acceptor chromophore.",
