Cholesterol, a major constituent within LNPs, contributes to their morphology that influences gene delivery. Herein, we examine the structure of LNPs containing cholesterol derivatives using electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and membrane fluidity assays. LNPs formulated with C24 alkyl derivatives of cholesterol show a polymorphic shape and various degrees of multilamellarity and lipid partitioning, likely due to phase separation. The addition of methyl and ethyl groups to the C24 alkyl tail of the cholesterol backbone induces multilamellarity (>50% increase compared to cholesterol), while the addition of a double bond induces lipid partitioning (>90% increase compared to cholesterol). LNPs with multilamellar and faceted structures, as well as a lamellar lipid phase, showed higher gene transfection. Unraveling the structure of mRNA-LNPs can enable their rational design toward enhanced gene delivery.",

Upon further inspection of Sito LNPs with a cryo-transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM), we found that Sito LNPs have a faceted surface, as opposed to spherical Chol LNPs with smooth curvature, likely due to phase separation of comprising lipids, 11 and potentially, the formation of two-dimensional lipid crystals in the LNP membrane. 8 In this study, we investigated the structure of LNPs containing naturally occurring phytosterols (namely, \u03b2sitosterol (Sito), fucosterol (Fuco), campesterol (Camp), and stigmastanol (Stig)) using cryo-TEM, thermal analysis, and a fluorescent assay (TMA-DPH probe). We found that the incorporation of Chol analogs significantly affects the morphology of the LNPs and enhances nucleic acid delivery.

The differences in particle morphology are likely due to the separation of the comprising lipids. 11 The comparison of LNP sizes measured by DLS and cryo-TEM ( Figure 3C ) revealed a consistently smaller size in the micrographs, likely due to the contrast challenges associated with cryo-EM where the PEG chains may not be visible.

We speculate that there is an optimal percentage of multilamellar structures per Nano Letters pubs.acs.org/NanoLett Letter particle population. Out of these three analogs, Camp LNPs have the highest percentage of internal defects (15%), while Sito and Stig LNPs have <2% of particles with irregularities in the internal structure. Interestingly, Sito and Stig LNPs formed faceted structures, suggesting the formation of two-dimensional crystals. 8 Camp LNPs, however, show a predominantly smooth curvature (much like the previously proposed \"onion\" structure). 16 Chol LNPs have a small fraction of particles with internal defects (8%) but hardly any multilamellarity. Fuco LNPs have ca. a 2-fold improved transfection compared to Chol LNPs, and 95% of Fuco LNPs have internal defects and no multilamellarity.

Bernsdorff and Winter previously used TMA-DPH in structurally similar DPPC vesicles to investigate their phase transitions and were able to identify changes in the probe orientation as a function of vesicle composition and temperature. 18 We utilized this probe to investigate if lipid membranes of phytosterol LNPs exhibit differences in rigidity, as this observation could provide more insights into their cellular uptake and endosomal escape; Sun et al. have LNPs possess a dense inner core, bilamellar structure, and smooth particle curvature. Camp, Stig, and Sito LNPs all form multilamellar structures, although only Stig and Sito LNPs demonstrate a polymorphic shape, with multilamellar structures forming along the flatter edges. Fuco LNPs show inner areas with distinctly different electron density, also referred to as internal defects. Examples of LNP classification are highlighted in the boxes: green, bilamellar, internal defects; black, bilamellar, no internal defects; blue, multilamellar, no internal defects; white, multilamellar, internal defects; red, multilamellar, no internal defects, faceted. The scale bar in all images denotes 100 nm. Nano Letters pubs.acs.org/NanoLett Letter previously reported that \"rigid\" polymeric nanoparticles were more successful at passing the cellular barrier compared to the \"soft\" ones, suggesting that the higher rigidity should correlate with the higher transfection. 21 We tested the probe anisotropy in the range of 20 to 80\u00b0C, focusing on the physiologically relevant temperatures. In addition to the cholesterol analogs mentioned above, we also tested LNPs prepared with vitamin D2 (D2) and stigmasterol (Ster) as controls, as these previously showed high mRNA encapsulation but no transfection and poor encapsulation but improved transfection compared to Chol LNPs, respectively. 10 The results are shown in Figure 4A ,B. Chol and Camp LNPs demonstrated the highest anisotropy throughout the entire tested range, followed by Sito and Stig and, last, Fuco LNPs. As mentioned before, this indicates that Fuco LNPs have the most disorganized bilayer structure. The anisotropy pattern matched for cooling and heating cycles, suggesting that the lipids do not separate during the heating process. The drop in the anisotropy with increasing temperature was expected due to the increased Brownian motion ( Figure S3 ). Chol and Camp LNPs, as well as Sito and Stig LNPs, showed nearly identical anisotropy trends over the entire tested temperature range.",

            "text": "At the physiologically relevant temperature (35\u00b0C), the TMA-DPH assay revealed marginal differences in anisotropy of analog LNPs, except for Fuco LNPs that showed higher anisotropy (ca. 0.29 vs 0.27 on average for the other phytosterol LNPs). Ster and D2 LNPs, previously identified outliers, showed significantly lower anisotropy at 35\u00b0C (approximately 0.25 and 0.22, respectively). These findings suggest that there is likely a Goldilocks membrane rigidity range; the somewhat fluid lipid membrane of D2 LNPs may disintegrate before the LNPs pass the cellular barrier, while the excessively rigid membrane of Fuco LNPs perhaps fails to successfully release the cargo due to their excessive stability in the biological environment. However, low encapsulation efficiency may compromise cellular uptake despite optimal rigidity. Ster LNPs demonstrated an anisotropy value more similar to the LNP baseline and were more successful at transfection than Chol LNPs; however, their encapsulation efficiency was significantly lower, likely due to the lack of free rotation of the alkyl tail. 22 Thermal Analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermal analysis method used to characterize phase transitions, frequently used for liposomes. 23 Phospholipid-based liposomes containing Chol analogs undergo phase transitions in the physiological temperature range, 24\u221226 which change lipid organization and may even induce changes in lipid membrane curvature. 27, 28 These properties may have implications on the nucleic acid cargo delivery; for example, complexes of cationic liposomes containing DNA show various transfection efficiencies, depending on the organization. 29 Coupled with the membrane rigidity assay, DSC could be a useful tool in understanding the effect of Chol analogs on membrane structure 23 and, potentially, deducing whether the phase transitions of LNPs occur at the membrane surface or in Figure S4 ).

Jovanovic\u0301et al. previously reported that DPPC/Chol and Sito liposomes undergo phase transitions in a similar range, although melting temperatures depended on the lipid content. 23 These phase transitions were attributed to the gel-to-liquid transition, and it has been demonstrated that the increasing fraction of phytosterols in the liposomal formulations induces ordering in the lipid membrane, suppressing the said transition. 18, 23 siRNA-LNP formulations with Chol-based cationic lipids undergo endothermic phase transitions in a similar range, which were identified as lamellar-to-inverted-hexagonal based on smallangle X-ray scattering. 30 We have previously identified that the Chol and Sito LNPs containing mRNA possess a lamellar internal structure at 25\u00b0C, 10 which may suggest that LNPs with phytosterols undergo lamellar-to-inverted hexagonal transition when heated.",

Reduced transition temperatures would suggest reduced intermolecular interactions. 31 Analysis of the transition peaks among the \"empty\" phytosterol LNPs suggests that the Camp LNPs have weaker intermolecular interactions compared to Chol LNPs, while the rest of the LNPs have increasingly stronger intermolecular interactions. This could be interpreted as the increasing LNP membrane rigidity; therefore, Camp LNPs are the least rigid, while Stig LNPs are the most rigid. Since membrane rigidity may concur with the multilamellarity, DSC data explains why Sito and Stig LNPs both have a high degree of lamellarity and transition peaks at ca. 55\u00b0C. Stig LNPs, however, exhibit an additional, more pronounced peak at 102\u00b0C, which signifies the inherently different lipid arrangement in the formulation. Similarly, Fuco, Camp, and Chol LNPs show additional thermal events after the main transition; Fuco LNPs showed an additional phase transition while Chol and Camp LNPs showed glass transitions. The differences in thermotropic behavior correlate with the classification suggested on the basis of the results of cryo-EM and suggest that phytosterol LNPs may exhibit different lipid phases at physiological temperatures.",

This is evident from the DLS data shown in Figure 4D . DLS analysis revealed that LNPs containing no mRNA payload possess a smaller size with a much larger deviation compared to those with mRNA, reiterating that the presence of mRNA is instrumental in the lipid self-assembly and may influence lipid phase behavior. This assumption is further supported by TMA-DPH assay results ( Figure S3 ), which showed no defined phase transitions between 20 and 80\u00b0C. This observation might be the result of compromised binding of the hydrophilic TMA-DPH probe to the outer membrane layer due to the PEG shield or water displacement, previously observed in response to the incorporation of cholesterol into phospholipid membranes. 32, 33 Although the previous cryo-TEM study indicates that the incorporation of siRNA into LNP formulations does not alter the LNP morphology, 9 future studies are needed to deconvolute further the effect of the solvent and the chemistry of RNA cargo as well as the lipid composition and ratios.",

Camp LNPs showed a thermal pattern similar to Chol yet possessed a much larger degree of multilamellarity and, potentially, the inverted-hexagonal phase at a physiological temperature. Fuco, the only phytosterol in the series containing a double bond in the alkyl chain, likely induces an entirely different lipid ordering due to the lipid separation, as evident from both the distinct fraction of internal defects and the thermal pattern. Despite the subtle variations in the chemical structures of these phytosterols, they greatly affect the lipid packing in LNP formulations.
