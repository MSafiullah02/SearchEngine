S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious disease. Its clinical manifestations include fever, progressive pulmonary infiltration, lymphopenia, and in severe cases, respiratory failure. 1,2 SARS outbreaks have swept quickly through many regions in the world, particularly East Asia. 3 The number of patients with newly diagnosed SARS exceeded 5000 in Mainland China and reached 2490 in Beijing by May 24, 2003. 4 Patients with compromised immune function, such as those age \u03fe 60 years and those with other severe chronic conditions, had a poor prognosis and high fatality rates. 5 Most patients with cancer had poor immune function and were vulnerable to infections that could present with fever, an important manifestation of SARS. The differential diagnosis of SARS in patients with cancer sometimes was challenging. Although definitions of SARS were issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), simple adoption of the established criteria could lead to overdiagnosis in patients with cancer or to an increase in the risk of spreading SARS within cancer hospitals. Therefore, special attention should be paid to patients with cancer in the diagnosis of SARS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 385, "end": 386, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 513, "end": 514, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 681, "end": 682, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In the current report, we present our experience with exclusion and quarantine for SARS in patients with cancer during the peak of the SARS epidemic in Beijing, China.

However, the patient presented with the same signs and symptoms previously during chemoembolization. This indicated a febrile reaction to tumor necrosis. Patient 5 had a sudden onset of rigor and fever 1 hour after receiving a thymosin transfusion.

Her body temperature would decrease after she received prophylactic antibiotics and agents that increased leucocyte counts. Thus, febrile neutropenia was suspected. SARS was ruled out for the other seven patients due to their positive responses to experimental antibiotics. In these seven patients, body temperature decreased, and pulmonary lesions were absorbed. Two of these seven patients (Patients 7 and 10) had lung carcinoma and presented with dyspnea and fever.

Patients could not respond to an attack by the SARS virus in the same way that healthy individuals could. 6, 7 The clinical manifestation of SARS in patients with cancer may be atypical. Moreover, the increased possibility of infection in patients with cancer paralleled the decline in neutrophil counts and increased significantly when the number of neutrophils in the peripheral blood decreased to 1 \u03eb 10 9 /L. 8 Both situations made the differential diagnosis of SARS in patients with cancer difficult. In addition, patients sometimes denied their contact history during the peak of the SARS epidemic; this exacerbated the difficulty of diagnosing SARS and rendered the epidemiologic evidence for the WHO case definitions unreliable. Based on our experience, we recommend the following steps to improve the accuracy of diagnosis: 1) clinical data related to fever should be collected and reviewed carefully, and a consultant panel should be organized that includes experts from internal medicine, clinical oncology, surgery, and medical radiology departments in cancer hospitals; 2) attention should be paid to differential diagnoses between primary diseases (such as lung cancer) and diseases caused by other factors, even if symptomatic, laboratory, and radiographic findings are consistent with SARS; 3) radiographic manifestations should be reviewed carefully, with special attention paid to possible causes other than SARS and to radiographic changes following experimental therapy; 4) experimental therapies should begin early and should be adjusted in a timely fashion, and clinical and radiographic presentation should be followed closely; and 5) most importantly, quarantine and close surveillance should be performed once SARS is suspected.
