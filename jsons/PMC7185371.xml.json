            "text": "Viral invasion and replication are detected by innate immune sensors in cells, triggering downstream signaling pathways that can ultimately result in the activation of systemic immune responses. Several innate immune sensors recognize cytoplasmic viral RNA [1], and lead to the production of IFNs which in turn trigger various antiviral pathways aimed at halting viral replication and spread. These antiviral effects include double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-dependent inhibition of mRNA translation, and 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L-mediated RNA degradation [2]. Innate immune responses also trigger the activation of adaptive immunity in the form of T and B cell activation and proliferation, and modulate the phenotype and function of these adaptive responses 3, 4.",

            "text": "In some cases, viral infection also induces the formation of cytoplasmic granules similar to those induced by cellular stresses such as heat, oxidation, hypoxia, and osmotic pressure, which are referred to as stress granules (SGs). SGs are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) aggregates that contain translationally stalled mRNAs, 40S ribosomes, and various RNA-binding proteins 5, 6, 7 (Box 1\n).Box 1An overview of SG biologyCells respond to various insults including heat, oxidative stress, nutrient starvation, and proteotoxic stress by forming cytoplasmic nucleoprotein aggregates termed SGs 5, 68, 69, 70. Multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) localize to SGs, and some have been used as markers for these cytoplasmic bodies (Table I\n). Although the formation of SGs in live cells can be detected by monitoring fluorescence-tagged SG marker proteins, biochemical isolation of SGs is notoriously challenging because these are not membrane-sequestered compartments.SG formation has been interpreted as a response aimed at preventing the generation of abnormal proteins by transient stalling of translation in times of cellular stress. Stalled transcripts undergo translation upon recovery from stress, or alternatively they are degraded in another granular compartment termed the processing body (P-body, PB) 71, 72. Unlike SGs, PBs are present in the unstressed cell, and contain enzymes for mRNA degradation such as decapping enzymes and 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonucleases (Table I). It is thought that transcripts and proteins can move from SGs to PBs (and vice versa), and these aggregates share some of their components (Table I) [60]; however, the mechanisms underlying the proposed exchange of contents are unclear.SG proteins, as defined by studies using proteins characteristic to SGs as markers [73], are either diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm or localized in the nucleus in normal conditions; stress triggers their aggregation in the cytoplasm 5, 74. A common event downstream from the aforementioned cellular stresses is phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at serine 51, which is considered to be an initial trigger for SG formation. Four eIF2\u03b1 kinases, PKR, GCN2, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and heme-regulated eIF2\u03b1 kinase (HRI), can phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 in mammals (Table II\n). The mechanisms that connect eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to SG formation remain to be elucidated.Some proteins have been shown to be crucial for the formation and or stability of SGs. These include G3BP1, a phosphorylation-dependent endonuclease 30, 75, and T cell restricted intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1) and TIA-related protein (TIAR) that are collectively termed TIA1/TIAR 74, 76. Removal of these regulators by genomic deletion or RNAi blocks SG formation by sodium arsenite, and a mutant form of G3BP1 (S149E) acted as a dominant inhibitor of SG formation [75]. However, because of analytical constraints, the molecular machinery underlying the formation of SGs remains unclear.",

When viral RNA binds at the helicase and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RIG-I, its N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) are covalently modified with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the E3 ligase, tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) [20], and oligomerize [21]. The ubiquitinated and oligomerized CARDs bind to the CARD domain on IPS-1 on mitochondria, peroxisomes, and/or mitochondrion-associated membrane (MAM) regions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [22]. The translocation of RIG-I to these locales is facilitated by the chaperone protein 14-3-3\u025b [23]. The requirement for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains is complex because several reports have demonstrated the importance of non-covalent interaction between RIG-I CARDs and the unanchored K63\u2013ubiquitin chains 21, 24. Furthermore, it has been reported that RIG-I forms a signaling-competent filament on substrate dsRNA independently of ubiquitins [25]. Although a recent structural report suggests that the conformation of the active tetramer of RIG-I CARDs can be stabilized by covalent conjugation with ubiquitin chains, and that filament formation may partially compensate for ubiquitin-dependent RIG-I activation [26], further analysis will be necessary to clarify the molecular role of ubiquitin chains in RIG-I signaling. The RIG-I/IPS-1 interaction recruits signaling molecules including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). Subsequent activation of TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1)/inducible I\u03baB kinase (IKKi), and IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2 induces downstream signaling via the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathways, respectively. These pathways ultimately culminate in the activation of the transcription factors IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-\u03baB, which activate the transcription of IFN and proinflammatory cytokine genes [27]. These pathways are summarized in Figure 1\n. Moreover, secreted IFN amplifies the expression of ISGs, such as RLRs, PKR, and OAS, as a host strategy to amplify antiviral signaling.",

For instance, in the case of infection of several picornaviruses, such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), transient formation of SGs is associated with the cleavage of Ras-GAP SH3 domain binding protein-1 (G3BP1) by the viral 3C protease 29, 30, 31. This was confirmed by the observation that ectopic expression of cleavage-resistant G3BP1 leads to stable SG formation. On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated that infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) produces oscillating SGs [34]. HCV strongly activates PKR via the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of its genome [35], thereby inducing SGs 34, 36, but stress-inducible expression of growth arrest DNA-damage-inducible 34 (GADD34), a regulatory component of host protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), leads to dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and terminates SG formation. In the stress-recovered condition, GADD34 protein is rapidly downregulated by an unknown mechanism and the phosphorylated form of eIF2\u03b1 reaccumulates in the cells, resulting in an oscillating pattern of SGs.",

An implication of these findings is that SGs have an antiviral role and that, accordingly, viruses have developed strategies to suppress their formation (Figure 2). Indeed, there are multiple examples of viruses actively inhibiting the formation of SGs through varied mechanisms 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. An inverse correlation between SG formation and viral propagation has been reported in multiple viral replication systems. In the case of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection, SG formation is inhibited by the viral core protein, which directly interacts with SG component, caprin 1 [44]. In cells infected with a mutant virus whose core protein fails to interact with caprin 1, inhibition of SG formation is abrogated and viral propagation is significantly impaired both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that SGs impact negatively on viral replication. This notion is further supported by studies showing that RLRs localize to virus-induced SGs, suggesting that SGs may act as a platform for viral RNA sensing and the activation of downstream signaling pathways [42]. There is a strong correlation between PKR-dependent SG formation and IFN production in some viral infections 29, 42, 49 (Figure 2).

            "text": "Whether PKR is required for virus-induced IFN production is controversial. Some reports indicate that IFN production is significantly impaired in PKR-deficient cells 29, 42, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, whereas others show that deficiency of PKR has no effect 54, 56, 57, 58. One possible explanation for these observations is that there are differences in the viruses and cell types used in each study. In the early 2000s, several studies demonstrated that virus-induced activation of IFN is independent of PKR in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are known to be \u2018IFN-producing cells\u2019. However, subsequent reports revealed that robust IFN induction by pDCs is exclusively induced by TLRs, suggesting a dispensable role for PKR in TLR-mediated signaling. By contrast, the PKR-dependency of RLR-mediated signaling is more complicated. Because viruses are extraordinary diverse in their genome structures and life cycles, different viruses are likely to produce different RNA species during viral replication at distinct locations in the infected cells. Thus, the ability of these viral RNAs to activate PKR and/or RLRs could be divergent. Moreover, as mentioned above, viruses employ a variety of strategies to terminate antiviral responses. For instance, it has been demonstrated that Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN production is independent of PKR 53, 54. Indeed, infection of SeV can activate IFN without SG formation [29]; however, infection by a mutant virus in which accessory protein C is deleted leads to significant activation of PKR and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, with concomitant upregulation of IFN 45, 59, suggesting that PKR is dispensable for SeV-induced IFN activation, but is responsible for the enhancement of IFN production. Thus, the PKR-dependency of IFN production might vary depending on the ability of each virus to modulate host responses. This notion is supported by reports in which IFN production following stimulation with a virus-mimetic synthetic dsRNA such as poly(I:C) showed significant PKR-dependency 29, 42, 49, 53, 55.",

It has been proposed that, if the stress stimulus is not resolved, the stalled transcripts are transferred to processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs) for degradation [60]. This view requires reexamination because SG formation does not necessarily result in translational shut-off. Indeed, it is unclear whether SG formation results in total host cell translational shut-off or translational arrest at limited areas in the cytoplasm. Many viruses hijack host cellular compartments to form replication complexes for viral transcription and translation 61, 62. The fact that IFN is efficiently translated in virus-infected and SG-containing cells 29, 42, 49 suggests that SG formation does not necessarily correlate with total host translational shut-off.",

In response to various stresses, eukaryotic cells initiate stress responses, including the formation of SGs, in which cytoplasmic mRNAs are compartmentalized to escape dysregulation. Accumulated lines of evidence show that viral infection can also induce stress responses including SG formation concurrently with the initiation of innate antiviral responses via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The observations that (i) there is a strong correlation between SG formation and IFN production, (ii) there is a reverse correlation between SG formation and viral propagation, and (iii) RLRs are localized in viral-induced SGs together with viral non-self RNAs, together strongly suggest that SGs have an antiviral role and possibly function as platform to initiate innate responses. Interestingly, this notion clearly indicates that the quality control machinery for \u2018self RNA\u2019 and the host defense mechanism against invasion of \u2018non-self RNA\u2019 are closely coordinated with each other. Moreover, it is interesting to note that these observations may help us to develop a novel therapeutic or preventive strategy for virus-induced infectious diseases.",

Translation-stalled mRNAs may be transferred to a distinct cellular compartment, the P-body, to be degraded. Viral RNAs are also recognized by RLRs, which are recruited to SGs with several signaling molecules including antiviral proteins and ubiquitin ligases. The OAS\u2013RNase L pathway cleaves viral RNAs, and the cleaved RNAs may act as ligands for RLRs. IPS-1, which is localized on mitochondria and/or MAM, forms prion-like aggregates, interacts with RLRs on SGs, and activates IFN-inducing signaling. Areas that require further investigation are highlighted with question marks.",
