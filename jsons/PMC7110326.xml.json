These experimental animals are the progeny of (C \u00d7 B6)F1 females and (C3 \u00d7 D2)F1 males and are referred to as UM-HET3 mice. The F1 breeding animals were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were housed segregated by sex (except for the BCA [Breast Cancer and Aging] females from 3 to 6 months of age; see below) in a single suite of specific pathogen-free (SPF) rooms and were exposed to identical environmental conditions (12:12 hour light:dark cycle, 23\u00b0C). Mice were given ad libitum access to water and Purina (St. Louis, MO) laboratory mouse chow. The cages were covered with microisolator tops to minimize the spread of infectious agents. Sentinel mice were tested every 3 months to verify the pathogen-free status. The test battery always includes titers for Sendai, minute virus of mice (MVM), and coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus), and one of the four quarterly tests includes, in addition, assessment of titers for PVM (pneumonia virus of mice), GD-7, Reo-3 (reovirus), Mycoplasma pulmonis, LCMV (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), ectromelia, K virus, polyoma virus, mouse adenovirus, and parvovirus. All such tests were negative throughout the course of the study. This work was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Michigan.",

Mice judged by an experienced technician to be so severely ill that survival for more than a few additional days was unlikely were taken to the necropsy suite and humanely euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation; this group made up 59% of the total. The set of criteria used for this decision include: (a) large and/or bleeding tumor mass; (b) inability to eat or to drink; (c) loss of more than 10% of body weight in a week; (d) lethargy and lack of responsiveness to gentle prodding; and (e) other signs of inanition, such as poor grooming and hunched posture. Mice found dead were also submitted for necropsy. The necropsy protocol has been described in detail elsewhere (1), and involved both gross inspection and histological examination of sections from 37 organs. Histopathological evaluation of cases in the LAG1 and BCA cohorts was conducted by the late Clarence Chrisp. Evaluation of cases in the LAG2 cohort was performed by Ruth Lipman. A selection of cases with a provisional diagnosis of fibrosarcoma (from the LAG1 and BCA cohorts) or hemangiosarcoma (from the LAG2 cohort) were directly compared to ascertain that the difference in diagnosis reflected physical differences in the lesion and not merely a difference in nomenclature. Although it is difficult to determine the cause of death in mice found dead, or to assign a cause of death in cases where severe morbidity prompted euthanasia of the animal, for this study, a lesion was deemed to be the cause of death if it was the sole serious lesion present, or if the lesion was so severe that it was likely to have led to the death of the mouse or to the symptoms that led the husbandry staff to submit the animal for euthanasia. Mice with no severe lesions or with multiple severe lesions were classified as \u201cunknown\u201d in the cause of death tabulation.",

From the conceptual point of view, QualTL is an example of a latent class model in which the categorical outcomes (phenotypes) are modeled as a function of unknown (unobservable) putative genotype at a putative marker. The computational algorithm is outlined in Galecki and colleagues (5), and the method has been used successfully in a previous study of fitness and life span in Caenorhabditis elegans (6). In the context of the current article, single marker analysis was used instead of interval mapping, so a simplified version of the QualTL algorithm corresponding to a standard logistic regression was used. The analysis performed is designed to evaluate the effects of genetic differences on the proportions of mice dying of specific causes, or with specific lesions. This approach is biased to an unknown extent by a potential confound between the cause of death and the life span of the mice; the data set cannot provide information about risks for specific diagnosis in mice at times later than the age at death.",

Key features included at least daily inspection for recent deaths (typically twice a day for 5 days each week), and a willingness to euthanize mice that appeared so severely ill that survival for more than a few additional days seemed unlikely. This system allowed us to obtain informative necropsies on more than 90% of the mice in this study (excluding those culled for fighting or because of errors in record-keeping or mouse husbandry). An attempt was made to infer a most likely cause of death in each case, and this was possible in 886 of the 1004 cases evaluated. In the other 118 cases, no single cause of death could be assigned, either (a) because advanced tissue autolysis prevented evaluation, (b) because two or more lesions were judged to have contributed to death or moribund state, or (c) in a small number of cases, because no lesion serious enough to have caused death could be identified.",

There is evidence of unanticipated differences in pathology between the LAG1 and LAG2 cohorts. Mouse urinary syndrome, for example, was common among males in the LAG1 group, but not noted in the LAG2 males. In addition, we found unexpectedly that fibrosarcoma was frequently a cause of death in the LAG1 and BCA mice (18% of virgin females and 5% of virgin males), but was infrequent in the LAG2 series (3% of virgin females and 1% of virgin males). Conversely, hemangiosarcoma was rare in the LAG1 group (3% and 1% in females and males, respectively), but much more common in LAG2 (13% and 10%, respectively). These variations in lesion prevalence may reflect subtle environmental differences under which the cohorts of mice were raised. It is also apparent that the proportion of mice dying of mammary adenocarcinoma was far higher among multiparous females (24% of diagnosable cases) than for virgin females (9%), consistent with previous assessments of the effects of hormonal environment on mammary cancer in mice.",

For hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphoma, the calculations involved data from both male and female mice pooled together. Because the risk of mammary adenocarcinoma differs between multiparous and virgin females, the calculation for this cause of death was done three times, once for multiparous females (BCA cohort only), once for virgin females (LAG1 and LAG2 cohorts), and once for all females regardless of mating status. Only the multiparous females showed a significant genetic effect, which is therefore listed in Table 3. The genome scan found no significant QualTL for hemangiosarcoma or for fibrosarcoma, but did find a strong association between D4Mit170p on mouse chromosome 4 and the likelihood that the mouse would die either of fibrosarcoma or hemangiosarcoma, considering these two histologically distinct lesions as a single combined category.",

Some of these differences are matters of design, such as the inclusion of virgin mice in LAG1 and LAG2 and the use of multiparous females for the BCA population. It is clear, though, that the studies also differ in ways that were unanticipated. For example, males in the LAG1 group had a high incidence of the mouse urinary syndrome (13,14), which for unknown reasons was not observed among the LAG2 males. Fibrosarcoma, though commonly judged to be the cause of death among the LAG1 mice (particularly among the virgin females), was much less common in the LAG2 series; conversely, hemangiosarcoma was a frequent cause of death in the LAG2 mice only. Because each population was produced by breeding (BALB/c \u00d7 C57BL/6J)F1 females to (C3H/HeJ \u00d7 DBA/2J)F1 males, we can only speculate that these differences reflect some uncontrolled factor(s), such as unknown contaminants in water or food or subtle alterations in environmental noise, air quality, or the like.",

The basis for the increased risk of mammary adenocarcinoma in multiparous as compared to virgin female mice is not understood, and contrasts with the relation between mammary cancer risk and child-bearing in humans. It seems likely that the locus on chromosome 4 modulates the factors, presumably hormonal, that increase mammary cancer risk in multiparous female mice, although it is noteworthy that mating increases the risk of breast cancer (from 6.7% to 12%) even in mice that inherit the low-risk allele at D4Mit55.

This is a lesion much more common in male than in female UM-HET3 mice, and post hoc analyses showed that this C allele was associated with an 80% increase in the risk of lethal pulmonary tumors in male mice, with an insignificant effect in females. We can postulate that the sex-specific factors that increase risk of lung cancer in these males may themselves be modulated by this chromosome 6 polymorphism. These data also provide a new perspective on a prior study (15) of strain differences in tumor susceptibility in mice given a single oral dose of the potent carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). This earlier work included analyses of induced tumor incidence in BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, and DBA/2J mice, the grandparental stocks used to produce UM-HET3 mice. Among the four inbred stocks, the highest incidence of pulmonary adenocarcinoma was seen in the BALB/c mice, and it is thus tempting to note the provisional association of the C allele at D6Mit198 with this lesion in the UM-HET3 stock.",

There are two potential confounding factors: (a) slides from the LAG2 mice were not evaluated by the same individual responsible for evaluating the LAG1 and BCA cohorts; and (b) the two groups of animals were produced and raised several years apart, and might therefore have been exposed, inadvertently, to different dietary or environmental influences. Comparison of a sample of cases with these lesions from each of the two necropsy series confirmed that they were indeed histologically distinct. Angiosarcoma in humans has been noted to exhibit microscopic heterogeneity; in one series, for example (16), all cases were reported to have focal vasoformative components similar to those in hemangiosarcomas in the LAG2 cohort, but 7% of the cases also contained solid components resembling the fibrosarcoma seen in the LAG1/BCA mice. Although it is possible that sampling at necropsy resulted in systematic differences in lesion presentation between the two series of cases, we do not consider this a likely explanation for the disparity. The second possibility is that the difference in lesion presentation was due to unknown environmental factor(s) that were different for the two groups of mice. We suspect that some unknown variation in environmental conditions between 1995 and 1998, such as an inadvertent change in the composition of the natural products diet or some alteration in water quality, may have led to the reciprocal increase in vascular neoplasia and reduction in fibrosarcoma risk, but we cannot put this idea to any immediate test. Our genetic results show that an allele linked to D4Mit170 in the BALB/c genome leads to a two-fold increase in risk of hemangiosarcoma and fibrosarcoma compared to the corresponding B6 allele. The experiment-wise p value <.009 makes it unlikely that this is a chance association. We thus hypothesize that the vascular tumors and sarcomas may, in UM-HET3 mice, share a common underlying basis, modulated by this chromosome 4 locus.",

A second, weaker, association was seen for paternal alleles mapping between 50\u201392 cM. The current study found no evidence for the proximal gene, but did detect a paternal allele linked to marker D4Mit170 at 67 cM. These two results, though consistent for the distal marker, cannot be considered as independent confirmation, because the LAG1 mice evaluated by Xu and colleagues were included in the current, much larger data set.

In contrast, the current data set was evaluated using an algorithm adapted for mapping of qualitative traits, in which the phenotype takes on one of a small number of discrete values, in the current instance, either the presence or the absence of a specific lethal lesion.",

Each mouse in these three cohorts has been genotyped at > 150 biallelic markers, and DNA has been archived that would support fine-scale mapping of chromosomal regions of interest in later studies. Tissue blocks and stained sections are available from each of the necropsy cases as well, which could promote follow-up studies of questions concerning the histopathology of spontaneous late-life tumors, and, potentially, of their molecular constituents as evaluated by tissue microarrays or related immunohistochemical techniques. Each mouse in the series has also been tested for levels of several serum hormones (10,18) and for age-sensitive T-cell patterns (3,7). The combination of genetic, physiological, and terminal histopathological resources for these mice provides a unique resource for future studies of tumor biology in aging animals.",
