Evidence suggests that a Chinese rare earth element ban would do little more than raise prices of consumer electronics (Hsu 2019).

This decoupling would increase political risk as well as opportunity. Decoupling in general increases risk for two reasons: First, decoupling leads to less communication between two sides, and less communication increases misunderstanding and risk of conflict. Second, decoupling in some scenarios gives one side an opportunity to dominate the other side without negative consequences. Take this example: if rival countries A and B operate with two completely different R&D pipelines for supercomputers, and A develops an incredibly powerful supercomputer that\u2019s years ahead of B, A could potentially sabotage its rival\u2019s computer infrastructure with little repercussion (Denning 2019). US-China decoupling, however, also increases opportunity.

Additionally, China currently exports its methods of internet censorship and surveillance to other countries (Dave 2018). Evidence opposing decoupling includes plentiful international opportunities for Chinese business, especially in Europe where China already has well-established business networks.

The US and China are both making some progress regarding quantum computing, but neither country is likely to develop an ultra-powerful computer that can break encryptions (Naughton 2019). Nonetheless, the US and China may still race to develop powerful computers. In terms of artificial intelligence, the November 2019 Interim Report from the US Commission on Artificial Intelligence signals that the US is willing to step up funding for AI as well as wall off its AI-related intellectual property from China, and the US and China could be beginning a race for the best AI capabilities.

In terms of 3D printing, China wants to use this along with other manufacturing advances to become a leading supplier of high-tech components and equipment (Naughton 2018, pp. 320\u2013322).
