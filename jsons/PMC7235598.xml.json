During these times, the drug shortage could lead to serious consequences when it comes to patient outcomes. Certain patients might get transferred to other medical centers in order to access the required drugs affected by the local shortages.6 The risk of medication errors may be heightened, including that of drug omission, dispensing, or administration. For instance, replacing an institutional formulary medication that is experiencing shortage with another nonformulary medication involves creating a new computerized physician order entry build, familiarizing physicians with the new order entry, as well as pharmacists and nurses with preparation and administration. All of these additional steps carry a higher risk of error particularly in a pandemic situation where it is common to see healthcare providers deployed from their routine practice area or even patient population to serve in a new setting. It may also increase the frequency of patient monitoring, which increases the projected healthcare costs.6 The conduction of clinical trials will also be affected by drug shortages thus delaying the delivery of essential, lifesaving, and breakthrough drugs.7\n",

For example, recently, this has involved the compassionate use basis for drugs such as remdesivir. This medication has resulted in a numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in patients with severe symptoms.17 Pharmacists are involved in corresponding with health authorities, granting institutional review board approvals, and submitting the necessary related paperwork. However, the role of the pharmacists does not stop here. It extends to preparing the required computerized order entry build, communicating with supply chain, and up till the process of actually preparing the medication for administration. This is in addition to the role of the clinical pharmacist in collaborating with physicians to select candidates for the medication and optimizing overall medical therapy.",

The media and high-level political attention given to such therapies have resulted in a dramatic increase in demand. The pharmacist is entrusted with advocating for appropriate prescribing and also continuing to secure such medications for patients who depend on them for their main indications. The pharmacist is not only involved in provider and patient education but also helping in setting institutional and community pharmacy policies on appropriate prescribing and dispensing of these medications. As has been previously suggested in a report from China, systematic pharmacist approach begins with drug demand analysis to identify drugs of interest, formulate special approval procedures and design best practice alerts to avoid inappropriate prescribing and drug hoarding.18\n",

Pharmacists are expected to be involved in strategies to deal with these shortages which involve evaluating and switching to alternative generic medications and switching between therapeutic options. Examples here include the switching from neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium, on shortage due to increased demand, to rocuronium. Another example is switching between the intravenous analgesic fentanyl to remifentanil. Such changes while they may seem simple involve a crucial role for the pharmacist in educating other members of the healthcare team on the appropriate use and other associated ordering and administration information to avoid the medication errors that we previously discussed. Other strategies include using adjuvant medications to spare the use of those in high demand as well as supplementing with oral or transdermal formulations to stretch the supply of the intravenous ones. Examples here include utilizing dexmedetomidine, and the use of oral formulations of lorazepam through feeding tubes for those with a functional gastrointestinal tract to attempt weaning propofol and midazolam. In addition, the use of transdermal fentanyl has the potential to help lower the rate or completely stop the intravenous infusion. Pharmacists are involved in designing specific algorithms to successfully implement these strategies utilizing their knowledge of the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of these agents.",
