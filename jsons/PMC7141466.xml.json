We allowed the reproduction number, R, to vary over time in our model, rather than simply fix this value, to capture possible variation in transmission as a result of control measures and behaviour change. However, our median estimate for the reproduction number in mid-January of 2\u00b74 is consistent with other estimates from the same period by use of a fixed R.2 As there is a delay from infection to symptom onset to hospitalisation, our model incorporated a delay to account for the time it takes for changes in transmission to be reflected in the observed data. Our estimate for transmission reduction was similar to that in another study, which focused on case counts in Wuhan and estimated that R had declined to around 1\u00b73 by the last week of January, 2020.3 We disagree that our assumed incubation period was inappropriate; our assumption of a 5\u00b72 day (SD 3\u00b77) value is consistent with later studies that have estimated a similar value.4\n",

            "text": "Xiong and colleagues raise an important point about the need to disentangle the precise drivers of the reduction in transmission. Although our model estimated an overall reduction in transmission, we did not have sufficient data to identify precisely how social distancing, quarantine, travel restrictions, and other lifestyle changes influenced these dynamics. There is no clear evidence that variation in the viral genome has driven changes in transmission,5 but sequence data could be useful for understanding the expansion and size of the outbreak. In a follow-up study, we have considered the effect of the timing and length of a lockdown, and the implications for ongoing transmission.6 As more data become available on the timing of control measures and subsequent outbreak dynamics, we agree that it will be crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to provide a robust evidence base for future policy- making.",
