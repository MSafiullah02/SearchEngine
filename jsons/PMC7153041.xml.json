Of special interest is the breadth of glycan-mediated recognition events, which comes from the extremely high information-coding capacity of glycans. The diversity of oligosaccharides is inherent in their configurational variability, created by the broad range of monosaccharide species, anomeric configurations, multiple linkages, and branching. Glycan complexity is potentially suitable for coding biological information, and interest is growing to \u201cdecode\u201d the sugar codes. To this end, investigating glycan-protein interaction at the atomic level is a necessity as only then will we understand the detailed mechanisms of these glycan-mediated biological activities. Recent techniques introduced include glycan microarray analysis and other high-throughput screening methods, and now we can begin to have a more systematic approach to analyzing glycan-protein interactions. We here introduce biophysical approaches to analyze the structure and function of glycan-protein interactions.",

Normally, 5\u201310 mg of purified protein is required. Bacterial expression systems are frequently used to express lectin domains in recombinant form (Fig. 7.1a), but obtaining large amounts of pure lectin in a soluble form is often difficult using bacterial expression systems. For instance, C-type lectin and C-type lectin-like domains contain three conserved disulfide bridges, and the cysteine residues hamper soluble expression with correct folding. Refolding of protein from inclusion bodies may be needed to produce functional lectin domains. The protein is solubilized and refolded under controlled conditions. This refolding procedure has been effective for the purification of mammalian C-type lectins and C-type lectin-like domains (Nagae et al. 2013b, 2014a, b, 2016b).\n",

Single chain Fv (scFv) originating from anti-carbohydrate MLS128 antibody was successfully expressed as a soluble form with PDI fusion (Subedi et al. 2012), while the other fusion tags such as thioredoxin or disulfide isomerase DsbC were not sufficient to produce soluble scFv (Fig. 7.1b). The expressed MLS128-scFv retains full binding activity toward synthetic carbohydrate antigens. The lectin domain of a C-type lectin-like receptor Dectin-1 was expressed as a GB1-fused protein (Dulal et al. 2016). The domain is correctly folded, is a monomer, and specifically binds a \u03b2-glucan ligand. The addition of the GB1 tag to the lectin domain greatly increased both yield (fivefold) and solubility (14-fold) (Fig. 7.1c).",

In these cases, mammalian expression systems may be necessary to express correctly folded proteins with posttranslational modifications. HEK293 cells, CHO cells, and their variant cells are frequently used as hosts. For example, protein O-mannosyl kinase (POMK), which phosphorylates the mannose residue on \u03b1-dystroglycan, has three N-glycosylation sites within the catalytic domain, and two sites out of three are partially N-glycosylated. To abolish the heterogeneity originating from partial N-glycan occupancy, two asparagine residues were mutated to glutamine and the mutated POMK expressed in HEK293 variant cells lacking N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase I (GnT-I), to produce uniformly glycosylated protein (Man5GlcNAc2-glycan attached), which was successfully crystallized and the atomic structure elucidated (Nagae et al. 2017b).",

Prior to interaction analysis, it is necessary to design and prepared a suitable glycan ligand. Ligand design is an extremely important step. The design may arise from information in the literature, or else the binding specificity needs to be ascertained experimentally (Steps 2 and 3). Several methods can be used to prepare glycan ligands: (1) purification of a free natural glycan or liberation of a specific glycan from natural glycoconjugates ( glycoprotein, glycolipid, etc.), (2) chemical synthesis, and (3) chemoenzymatic synthesis. Liberation of glycan from natural glycoprotein can yield large amounts of glycan provided that there is a plentiful supply of the natural glycoprotein. N-glycans attached onto glycoproteins can be liberated by chemical methods (e.g., hydrazinolysis) or by enzymatic methods (e.g., PNGase F) and then labeled with a fluorescent tag 2-aminopyridine for detection. Pyridylamino derivatives of oligosaccharides can be purified by HPLC, and their chemical structures confirmed by solution NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. For example, a biantennary N-glycan bearing bisecting GlcNAc was successfully purified with a yield of 120 \u03bcg from 200 mg of IgG and used for the analysis of a plant lectin E4-PHA (Nagae et al. 2014c, 2016b).",

It is known that several lectins recognize not only the glycan part but also the aglycon part (Nagae and Yamaguchi 2015), and here it is best to use the appropriate glycoconjugate (e.g., glycopeptide, glycolipid, etc.) as the ligand molecule. A C-type lectin receptor CLEC-2 binds to O-glycosylated podoplanin, and binding requires both disialyl core 1 glycan (NeuAc\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21\u20133[NeuAc\u03b12\u20136] GalNAc) and neighboring amino acid residues. The O-glycosylated podoplanin glycopeptide was prepared by overexpression using engineered yeast cells and in vitro sialylation (Kato et al. 2008). The substrate of POMK was chemoenzymatically synthetized, composed of core M3 trisaccharide unit ( GalNAc\u03b21\u20133GlcNAc\u03b21-4Man) and \u03b1-dystroglycan peptide. Mono-mannosylated peptide was chemically synthesized in advance, and then additional disaccharide units were successively introduced by two glycosyltransferases (Nagae et al. 2017b).",

            "text": "When doing the glycan microarray analysis, it is essential to immobilize a series of glycans onto the plate. The immobilization is one of the critical issues in the development of a glycan microarray. There are several ways to immobilize carbohydrate probes onto a suitable surface with retention of function. The chemically modified or unmodified glycans can be non-covalently or covalently attached onto the surface (Fig. 7.2a). Neoglycolipid (NGL) is an artificial glycolipid used to construct glycan microarrays via non-covalent interaction. In NGL technology, lipid-conjugated oligosaccharides prepared from natural sources or chemically synthesized are immobilized onto nitrocellulose-coated microarray slides (Palma et al. 2014). In covalent immobilization, various chemical reactions have been developed (Hyun et al. 2017). Among them, the conjugation reaction using amine-linked glycans is most widely used, and the Consortium for Functional Glycomics uses this chemistry for a glycan microarray platform (Fig. 7.2b). Several different functional groups which react with amines are utilized such as cyanuric chloride, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS), and epoxide. Measuring lectin binding requires labeling of the lectin with a fluorescent probe or the use of an antibody. Even so carbohydrate-lectin interaction is often too weak to be detected. In such cases, oligomerization of the lectin is a strategy to enhance inherent weak binding. Interactions may be detected by introducing dimeric glutathione S-transferase (GST) into the lectin as a fusion tag, as in the case of a mammalian lectin ZG16p-binding immobilized glycans (Kanagawa et al. 2014; Hanashima et al. 2015). Alternatively, it is possible to enhance binding by increasing the amount of surface glycans (Hanashima et al. 2015). However, it should be noted that the density of immobilized glycans may affect the specificity of lectins (Horan et al. 1999). Instead of fluorescence detection, label-free glycan biosensors have been developed to push the limit of detection (Hushegyi and Tkac 2014).\n",

Microarrays usually simply display relative binding affinity, but quantitative parameters (e.g., dissociation constant, K\nD) can be obtained by applying various concentrations (Liang et al. 2007). The estimated K\nD values are comparable to those obtained by other methods such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Moreover, effects of heterogeneous glycan mixing can be evaluated by immobilizing a mixture of glycans onto one spot (Liang et al. 2011). On-array inhibition assays can show if two different ligands bind competitively to the lectin (sharing a common binding site) or independently (each using a different binding site) (Fig. 7.2b) (Kanagawa et al. 2014). Glycan microarrays can also evaluate direct binding of mammalian cells and viruses (Nimrichter et al. 2004; Song et al. 2011), as well as biologically active glycans, if cell signaling can be linked to a fluorescent probe (Pai et al. 2016). This could result in rapid progress toward elucidating pathway-specific glycans.",

In addition, non-specific binding is usually present, which contributes a background signal. Therefore it is preferable to include other screening methods to validate the results. Several methods have already been developed to screen glycans which bind target lectins. The thermal shift assay is widely used for ligand screening. In this approach, melting temperature is measured in the absence and the presence of ligands and any shifts assessed (Vedadi et al. 2006). A temperature shift is indicative of increased stability acquired upon ligand binding. The purified protein is mixed with ligand in the presence of a fluorescent probe, such as SYPRO Orange, that binds to the denatured state. This method is simple and can be used for rapid ligand screening. Frontal affinity chromatography (FAC) can quantitatively evaluate weak interactions between lectins and glycans, as explained in the following section. The FAC method can also be used to screen for ligand binding. NMR is an excellent technique to determine the binding epitope of a lectin-glycan interaction. When the binding epitope is determined, a suitable ligand of minimum size is designed for use in X-ray crystallography. NMR can also be applied to high-throughput ligand screening (Meyer and Peters 2003) and be advantageously used with a mixture of binder and non-binders.",

            "text": "Saturation transfer difference NMR (STD-NMR) spectroscopy is a method for studying protein-ligand interactions by observing signals emanating from the ligand (Mayer and Meyer 2001; Haselhorst et al. 2009). When the target protein is saturated with selective pulses, the saturation is transferred to a bound ligand through intermolecular 1H-1H cross relaxation (Fig. 7.3a). Protons which are spatially close to the protein surface receive a higher degree of saturation compared with protons further away, and those on a non-binding ligand do not receive any saturation from the protein and are therefore not attenuated in the on-resonance spectrum. The subtraction of two spectra, one with protein resonance saturation (on-resonance) and the other without saturation of the protein resonance (off-resonance), results in a final STD-NMR spectrum showing only signals from bound ligands. For binding epitope analyses, the signal intensities of each peak are evaluated from an amplification factor (AF) = (I\noff \u2013 I\non)/I\noff, where I\non is the on-resonance signal intensity and I\noff is off-resonance signal intensity. Association constants can be estimated from a plot of AF against ligand concentration or initial growth rates of STD AF (Hanashima et al. 2010; Angulo et al. 2010). STD-NMR requires only a small amount of native protein, and no expensive protein labeling is necessary. STD-NMR spectroscopy can be utilized to detect binding of ligands with K\nD values in the 10\u22122\u201310\u22128 M range. Often screening for optimum STD-NMR conditions is required, such as probe temperature and optimal ligand-to-protein ratio (Fig. 7.3b). D2O solvent is preferred over H2O, to avoid direct and water-mediated saturation artifacts. High-affinity ligands typically reside longer within the protein binding site, undergo slow chemical exchange, and are thus not detectable by STD-NMR spectroscopy.\n",

For instance, the ring proton signals from the two branches (\u03b11-3 and \u03b11-6 branches) of bisected biantennary N-glycan largely overlap in 1D STD-NMR analysis. In contrast, the methyl proton signals from GlcNAc and core fucose are sharp and well separated for certain glycans. Hence these signals can be used as a reliable probe for branch-specific epitope mapping as exemplified by an analysis of the interaction between biantennary bisected glycan and a legume lectin PHA-E (Nagae et al. 2014c). The methyl proton signals of GlcNAc from outer branches and inner chitobiose unit show almost comparable intensities, indicating that the entire glycan contributes equally to binding with PHA-E (Fig. 7.3c). Consistent with this result, the crystal structure of bisected glycan-PHA-E complex showed that most sugar residues of the glycan ligand are recognized by PHA-E (Fig. 7.3c, right panel). Another approach is the use of 2D 1H-13C STD-heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( HSQC) to avoid the severe signal overlap in 1D NMR spectra. 2D STD- spectra have been collected to investigate the interaction between oligosialic acid and anti-oligosialic acid antibodies, 12E3 and A2B5 (Hanashima et al. 2013). STD-NMR is also applicable to analyze multiple binding modes of a unique ligand in a single binding site (Angulo and Nieto 2011). The duplicate sugar-binding modes of C-type lectin, DC-SIGN (Angulo et al. 2008), and anti-HIV antibody, 2G12 (Enr\u00edquez-Navas et al. 2012), have been analyzed in this way.",

Calcium-dependent intermolecular interactions of the LewisX-Ca2+ complex are observed, via the proton exchange rates of each hydroxyl group in an equimolar H2O/D2O solution (Fig. 7.4b). The conformation of the glycan ligand can also be analyzed by this method, including that of \u03b2(1,3)-glucan dependent on the degree of polymerization (DP) (Hanashima et al. 2014a). With \u03b2-glucan, the exchange of 13C-OH/D is dramatically retarded as DP extends, suggesting changes in quaternary structure (Fig. 7.4c).

In this way, Calsepa was found to specifically bind bisected N-glycans (Nagae et al. 2017a) (Fig. 7.5a). The specificity is explained by the crystal structure of bisected glycan-Calsepa complex (Fig. 7.5a, right).

As DP increases so does the affinity of scFv735. Thermodynamic parameters revealed that a large entropy loss upon interaction (T\u0394S = \u221272.7 kcal/mol for polysialic acid) is compensated for by a larger enthalpy gain (\u0394H = \u221280.1 kcal/mol). Importantly, the crystal structure of scFv735-ligand complex indicates that antibody 735 can recognize internal residues of polysialic acids (Fig. 7.5b, right). Therefore, increasing DP may provide a rapid cycle of dissociation-association and thereby enhance the affinity (Nagae and Yamaguchi 2014).",

There are two major methods to calculate kinetic parameters, first is by directly fitting the curve sensorgram to ideal binding models (more applicable to slow association/dissociation binding) and the second is steady-state analysis (for fast association/dissociation interactions). Maximum resonance values of a series of analyte concentrations (R\neq) are plotted against analyte concentration. In simple 1:1 steady-state binding model, the plot is fitted to the following equation:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ {R}_{\\mathrm{eq}}=C\\times {R}_{\\mathrm{max}}/\\left(C+{K}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\right) $$\n\\end{document}Req=C\u00d7Rmax/C+KDwhere C is concentration of analyte, R\nmax is maximum binding response, and K\nD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. For example, the heterophilic interaction of p24 Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domains is shown between p24\u03b21 and p24\u03b41. These GOLD domains interact with each other to form a hetero p24 family protein complex which is involved in the transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. The sensorgram shows fast association/dissociation binding and was analyzed by a 1:1 steady-state model (Nagae et al. 2016a) (Fig. 7.5c). To avoid immobilization artifacts, two experiments were performed: first p24\u03b21 was immobilized and p24\u03b41 injected and then the vice versa experiment performed. The estimated K\nD values of the two runs are comparable (1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M). SPR is widely used in lectin-glycan interactions, either alone or combined with other methods such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ITC, and thermal shift assays (Wesener et al. 2015; Ribeiro et al. 2016; Machon et al. 2017). When the lectin is immobilized and glycan injected, the SPR detection limit needs to be confirmed in advance. To overcome the sensitivity problem, biotinylated carbohydrates are immobilized onto streptavidin or neutravidin-coated sensor chips. Diluted lectins are injected and affinities calculated .",

In the presence of Calsepa lectin, long-range inter-residual trNOEs were observed between core \u03b2-mannose (Man-3) and GlcNAc-5\u2032 on the outer branch (Fig. 7.6e). The presence of this long-range trNOE indicates that the glycan assumes a compact back-fold conformation when bound to Calsepa lectin. In a second example, the interaction between ZG16p and phosphatidylinositol mannoside glycans (PIM1 and PIM2) was investigated by trNOE (Hanashima et al. 2015). In the presence of ZG16p, several inter- and intra-residual NOE correlations were observed in PIM1 (Fig. 7.6f). There were none with the inactive ZG16p mutant D151N. From these correlations, the conformation of PIM1 in ZG16p-bound state was elucidated.",

MD simulations yield the dynamic behavior of the glycan attached to Orysata lectin (Fig. 7.7b). Several docking models of Orysata in complex with a series of N-glycans were constructed, and the calculated binding free energies suggest that multiple binding modes exist in the solution, and the binding preference seems somehow to originate from an average of multiple binding modes that favors \u03b11-6 branch binding (Fig. 7.7c).
