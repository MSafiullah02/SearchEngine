            "text": "Objective: To quantify coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and to explore whether quantitative computer tomography (CT) could be used to assess severity on admission. Materials and methods: From January 17 to February 9, 2020, 38 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled in our hospitals. All clinical data and the chest CT on admission were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Firstly, a quantitative method based on multi-scale convolutional neural networks was used to assess the infected lung segments and this was compared with the semi-quantitative method. Secondly, the quantitative method was tested with laboratory results and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) by correlation analyses. Thirdly, both quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters between patients with different PSI were compared. Results: Thirty cases were finally enrolled: 16 (53.33%) of them were male, and the mean age was 48 years old. The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days. The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P < 0.001 for all; rs \u00bc 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), CRP (P \u00bc 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs \u00bc 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P \u00bc 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs \u00bc 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P \u00bc 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs \u00bc \u00c00.42, \u00c00.53, \u00c00.48). There was a positive correlation trend between the proportion of total infection and the pneumonia severity index (P \u00bc 0.0994; rs \u00bc 0.30) and a tendency that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had higher percentage of consolidation and total infection (P \u00bc 0.0903, 0.0989). Conclusions: Quantitative CT may have potential in assessing the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.",

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can develop a condition called coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), which can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and even death; therefore, detection of the infection is pivotal, as is making an early initial assessment so that subsequent planning of appropriate treatment and careful follow-up can be prepared in advance (see Figs. 1 and 2).",

Suspicion of COVID-19 would be high in patients with fever, typical imaging features and contact history. Two caseecontrol cohort studies found that for the factors associated with severity certain clinical characteristics and laboratory results differed between hospitalized patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and those not in ICU [6, 2] , suggesting that these characteristics might be used as predictors for the severity. Previous investigations into severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) reported the number of involved lung segments might be used as a predictor [7, 8] , which indicates that quantitative imaging might also be used as a method to assess severity. As quantitative computer tomography (CT) using a deep learning algorithm might have better performance and efficiency than the traditional semi-quantitative method based on visual score, in this study we intend to explore whether the quantitative method could have potential in assessing the severity of the COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.",

The lymphocyte decreased in 16 cases, which suggests that COVID-19 shares characteristics with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus can prohibit the cellular immune function by consuming a great deal of immune cells and finally lead to exacerbation of the patients [1, 16] . Therefore, the lymphocyte count could be used as a predictor for the severity of the infectious disease. The CRP and ESR elevated in 20 and 18 cases, although they were not specific indexes of infection, the continuously increased level might indicate the co-infections with some other kinds of bacteria and fungi, and the on course of deterioration of the disease. The LDH level increased in half of our cases, which might own to the cardiac and hepatic injury. The LDH reported in critically ill patients was higher than that in the noncritically ill patients [2, 6] , indicating increased LDH might be a predictive index among the hospitalized patients. The serum potassium slightly decreased in 18 cases, which might due to the increased angiotensin II leading to the aldosterone secretion from adrenal cortex, and the increased angiotensin II was found to have a correlation with the severity of the lung infection [17, 18] . The total or partial quantitative parameters positively correlated with CRP, ESR and LDH, and negatively correlated with lymphocyte, which implies that the quantification from the baseline chest CT is in accordance with the possible pathophysiological change of the COVID-19 and might be used as a biomarker for assessing the severity of the disease. PSI is a well-known scoring system for the assessment of the severity of community acquired pneumonia, and has also been verified in application of viral pneumonia [9] . We used PSI as a control to test the potential of the quantitative CT in assessment of the severity and found a tendency of a slight positive correlation between the proportion of total infection and the PSI score although there was no significantly statistical difference. The imbalanced proportion of cases in our study may be the reason for this. Of the 30 patients, 16 were in PSI grade I, and there was no specific score for these cases. Furthermore, only 2 cases were in PSI grade III and 1 case in PSI grade \u2163. Therefore, a more balanced proportional study is warranted in the future. Although the proportion of GGO or consolidation had no correlation with the PCI score, statistically. We should interpret this with caution that these two imaging features stand for different pathological courses, are the manifestations of infection and lung injury, and their dynamic changes might be possible predictors for the prognosis during the follow-up, which needs to be further explored in the following work.",
