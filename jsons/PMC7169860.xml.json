After transplantation, most patients received triple\u2010drug immunosuppression with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), prednisone, and either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Patients had gradual reduction of immunosuppressive therapy as time from transplant increased, if there was no evidence of significant acute or chronic graft rejection on radiographs, transbronchial biopsies, and lung function test results. Target CNI trough serum concentrations varied by center and were not recorded for this study. Additionally, prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and routine transbronchial biopsies to assess for rejection were not standardized across centers and changed over time within centers. Prophylaxis for RVI was routinely prescribed at only 1 institution that administered amantadine during the duration of the study, although individual subjects at other institutions may have received preventative therapies. Vaccination against influenza was routinely recommended at participating sites, although not all subjects may have received vaccination in the first year after transplantation due to the timing of transplantation.",

The site of RVI specimen was recorded when available in the medical chart, although no distinction was made between upper and lower RVI due to the limitations of the data available.

A seasonal distribution of RVI was observed for some viruses (Fig. 1). The viruses most commonly recovered during the winter months were influenza and RSV. Adenovirus occurred more frequently in the spring months while parainfluenza and rhinovirus peaked in the fall and spring. Herpesvirus infection occurred rarely. HSV presented as pneumonitis in 4 of the 5 documented episodes. The single subject with varicella died secondary to disseminated varicella zoster virus infection with associated pneumonitis.",

However, despite advances in surgical care and management, the pediatric mortality rate post lung transplant has remained relatively unchanged and is among the highest rate of all pediatric solid organ transplant procedures. RVI represents a potential obstacle to achieving improved outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated that RVIs occur in many adult lung transplant recipients and have been associated with post\u2010transplant morbidity including BOS. In a small cohort of pediatric subjects, adenovirus infection was associated with graft failure and death (7). However, the current scientific literature lacks a comprehensive examination of the risk factors for and the impact of RVI in pediatric lung transplant. This retrospective study evaluated the incidence and impact of RVI in pediatric lung transplant recipients from multiple centers throughout the United States and Europe.",

The seasonal variation of the viruses encountered reflects that seen in the general pediatric population. Clinicians should be aware of circulating community acquired viral infections to assist not only with the preparation of the patient for hospital discharge but also with evaluation of patients who return with acute illness. In addition, the viruses recovered are similar to those reported in previous studies (8, 9). Rhinovirus, which until recently was recovered with conventional viral culture, comprised a significant proportion of the RVI (20%), similar to that reported in adults (9). This reflects the importance of testing method, as newly available molecular testing becomes more widely available for respiratory specimens to detect not only rhinovirus but also other emerging viruses such as coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (9, 24, 25).",

In this cohort, younger age at the time of transplant, absence of induction therapy, etiology other than CF, and a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen were identified as independent risk factors for the development of RVI within the first year following lung transplantation. Younger age and etiology of transplant are both independently significant risk factors without evidence of an interaction. Younger children may be at increased risk for RVI for several reasons including immunologic naivety and increased exposure to infectious peers as seen in the general population. In addition, the proportion of subjects with adenovirus <3 years of age was significantly higher than the older cohort. Although this study did not distinguish primary adenoviral infection from reactivation of latent virus, younger children have been shown to harbor virus at higher levels in their tonsils that reactivated after in vitro stimulation (26). This provides another potential mechanism for increased risk of RVI in young transplant recipients. The observation that young age is associated with RVI development contrasts with what has been observed with pulmonary fungal infections in pediatric lung transplant recipients, where an older age is an independent risk factor. This suggests that patients may be at risk for distinctly different infections based on the age at transplantation.",

Interestingly, acute rejection episodes were not associated with increased risk of RVI.

The types of infecting agents, and most importantly impact, are significantly different between the 2 classes of RVI; RVI of the lower tract have been reported to carry more serious risks for subsequent mortality and rejection post transplant (8). Unfortunately, the locations of the RVI could not be accounted for in this study owing to limitations in the availability of information, specifically the site of specimen collection for viral culture and diagnosis. In addition, the exclusion of clinical episodes along with the lack of routine screening protocols for RVI during the period for which data were collected likely underestimates the actual incidence of RVI in this population. Underestimation of RVI, especially if more severe episodes were detected, may overestimate the impact of RVI in this population. A prospectively collected cohort, including molecular evaluation for all symptomatic episodes, is in process. The duration of viral shedding was not addressed in the study; however, reports in the literature indicate that viral shedding for both rhinovirus and RSV may be prolonged in transplant recipients (27, 28, 29). Clinicians should consider this possibility with continuation or recurrence of symptoms after an RVI. Although nosocomial and community\u2010acquired RVI were not specifically delineated in the data collection, a significant number of early nosocomial infections were detected with the analysis of a large subset of subjects for which duration of transplant hospitalization was known. Increased awareness and enhanced infection control measures could decrease the risk of early RVI in this at\u2010risk population.",

Although infection is the most serious complication beyond 1 month but <1 year post transplant, it remains a potentially serious complication regardless of the time since transplant. Limiting analysis of outcomes to 1 year post transplant may have censored the true occurrence of RVI in the patient population. Furthermore, it is possible that the relationships reported between RVI and pretransplant risk factors and negative outcomes, such as chronic graft rejection and/or retransplantation, may not manifest within the first year post transplant, limiting the ability to identify significant associations. In this case, the HRs of the univariable and multivariable Cox proportional models may be artificially low. Moreover, truly significant risk factors and events may have been excluded altogether. In addition, the impact of newer RVI therapeutics such as cidofovir (for adenovirus) and ribavirin (for RSV and human metapneumovirus) may impact the outcome related to treated RVI (30, 31, 32). Future studies are planned to examine associations between RVI and post\u2010transplant morbidities such as acute and chronic graft rejection beyond 1 year post transplant.",
