Bacterial infections typically progress within 24 h, whereas viral, mycoplasma, nocardial, mycobacterial, and fungal infections evolve over 2-7 days. Pneumonia caused by respiratory viruses is often preceded by symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection; these symptoms have been reported in \u223c85% of cases of PIV3 infection. However, during a nosocomial outbreak at Westmead Hospital (Westmead, Australia) in late 2003 that involved 7 allogeneic HSCT recipients and 1 autologous HSCT recipient, 3 patients presented with lower respiratory tract infection, 3 with upper respiratory tract infection that progressed within 19 days to lower respiratory tract infection, and 1 with an upper respiratory tract infection alone [6] . Radiological results indicate that areas of consolidation are typical of bacterial pneumonia, that peribronchovascular lesions are more likely due to viral or Pneumocystis pneumonitis, and that nodular (size, 11 cm) infiltrates are associated with fungal, nocardial, and tuberculous infections [7] .",

However, these manifestations require functioning neutrophils [16] and are late radiological signs in the HSCT recipient with prolonged neutropenia who may not develop cavitation until neutrophil recovery many days or weeks after nodules are first seen. In a recent report, it was determined that there were multiple nodules (diameter, !10 mm) in the lungs of 12 patients with viral pneumonitis (cytomegalovirus, influenza A virus, or adenovirus) associated with HSCT, hematological malignancies, or AIDS [8] and that there were multiple nodules (diameter, 110 mm) in the lungs of 19 patients with fungal infection (Aspergillus and Cryptococcus neoformans). The association between the presence of multiple small nodules and the diagnosis of viral pneumonitis was statistically significant [8] . Nodules !5 mm in diameter may be a more discriminatory finding for patients with viral pneumonitis, based on our case series. These changes were readily apparent for all CT scans, which were performed on days 2-10 of respiratory illness and preceded the microbiological diagnosis by 3-27 days in 4 of the 6 patients.",

The limitations of our study included nonsystematic screening, the introduction of new diagnostic testing during the study period, and the small sample size. It is possible that PIV3 infections were missed prior to 2005 and that other viral pathogens may have been present in cases not tested by PCR. However, this case series was not intended to suggest that all HSCT recipients with PIV3 infection will manifest nodular changes on high-resolution CT scans but to highlight that respiratory viruses, including PIV3, are potential causes of multiple small nodules. Currently, published diagnostic strategies recommend BAL for the investigation of nodular infiltrates on high-reso-lution CT scans of the lungs of allogeneic HSCT recipients, with testing for fungi, bacteria, and herpes viruses, but these strategies do not mention specific testing for respiratory viruses [19] . The presence of multiple small nodules on high-resolution CT scans should prompt clinicians to test for respiratory viruses, including PIV3.",

Furthermore, because of the high potential for person-to-person transmission of respiratory virus infection, the consequent risk of nosocomial infection [5] , and the increased risk of morbidity and/or mortality from HSCTs [2, 3, 6] , the identification of multiple, small, peribronchial nodules on high-resolution CT scans should stimulate an assessment and, if necessary, a review of infection control practices in HSCT units.",
