In certain instances, however, the presence of specific antibodies can be beneficial to the virus. This paradoxical process is known as the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection. In ADE, virus-specific antibodies enhance the entry of the virus into, and in some cases, its replication within T cells, monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells, through interactions with Fc and/or complement receptors. A significant, 4 log-fold or even greater increase in the in vitro production of several viruses was observed following exposure to low-affinity antibodies [7]. ADE of infection has been described for numerous viruses belonging to different families and orders as reviewed [8], [9]. Common properties of these viruses include (a) replication (partially or exclusively) in macrophages; (b) induction of the abundant production of antibodies that poorly neutralize even the homologous virus; and (c) they cause persistent infection commonly characterized by prolonged viremia.",

In the clinical setting, a greater risk to develop DSS was demonstrated in children with specific maternal antibodies or in patients who had previously been infected with either of the four DV serotypes and were subsequently exposed to the DV-2 strain of the virus [11]. Accordingly, it was found that DV produced more severe clinical manifestations in older individuals with subneutralizing levels of antibodies (induced by previous DV infections), than in individuals who had never been exposed to the virus [12]. Additionally, case-control studies demonstrated that the presence of DV antibodies is a significant risk factor for increased severity of disease and mortality in DHF/DSS [13], [14].",

As summarized recently by Robinson [38], binding of the antibody to gp41 initiates the complement cascade, leading to deposition of the complement component C3d,g on the virion. Opsonized virions subsequently bind to complement receptor type 2 (CD21). Ultimately, the engagement of CD21 and CD4 receptors by opsonized virions leads to an increased rate of HIV spread through the tissue culture and to a ten-fold increase in the release of reverse transcriptase (RT) into the culture medium, as well as to an increase of the level of HIV genomic RNA. Most importantly, C-ADE leads to an almost 100-fold increase in the number of the infective progeny virus synthesized, compared with infections by HIV-1 alone. C-ADE of HIV-1 infection requires CD4, but the binding of C1q to C1q-R of virions may also increase C-ADE [39]. According to recent studies by Robinson [38], the CXCR4 coreceptor is also required \u2013 in addition to CD4 and complement receptors \u2013 for enhanced entry of HIV into MT2 cells.",

We used a method described first in [44] in all of our studies to measure C-ADE. Briefly, serum samples from patients were heat-treated (56 \u00b0C, 30 min) and diluted at 1:64 with culture medium. Test serum dilutions were mixed with identical volumes of fresh pooled sera from HIV-seronegative healthy persons; HIV-1IIIB (100 TCID50) was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then, the mixture was added to and incubated together with 5 \u00d7 105 MT-4 cells without a change for 4 days at 37 \u00b0C. Growth of HIV in the cultures was monitored on days 3 and 4 with reverse transcriptase (RT) assay. The results were measured as count per minute, and expressed finally as an index (enhancement/neutralization index = E/N I) value. This E/N index is a ratio between virus growth in the presence and in the absence of test serum. Samples with an E/N I below 0.5 (i.e. two-fold decrease in virus production) were considered neutralizing, whereas samples with an E/N I over 2.0 (i.e. two-fold increase in virus production) were considered enhancing. The method has two major benefits: (1) it uses almost physiological complement concentration (25% in the infecting mixture) and (2) virus production is measured by RT assay, which measures only infective viruses.",

Recent, elegant studies by Mitchell et al. [37] and Robinson [38] help to resolve this apparently paradoxical situation. According to Mitchell et al. [37], the primary antigenic domain of gp41, responsible for the C-ADE of HIV and SIV, is a conservative sequence, which is critical for the gp41\u2013gp120 interaction. Even more importantly, Robinson [38] found anti-HIV immunoglobulin-enhanced replication of HIV strains belonging to different clades, indicating that antibodies mediating C-ADE are broadly reactive.",

They did not find any difference in the frequency of neutralizing or enhancing antibodies (measured in the presence of complement) in patients in different stages of HIV disease. Additionally, long-term non-progressor state was similarly not associated with the lack of enhancing antibodies. The main difference between their method and our procedure was the final concentration of human complement in the mixtures added to target cells. While complement concentration was 25% in our experiments, Montefiori's group [48], [49] used a concentration of 2.5%. It seems reasonable to suppose that the closer are the experimental conditions to in vivo conditions, the higher is the pathological relevance of the measurement.",

As it was detailed above, enhancing antibodies appear earlier after HIV infection than neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, the balance of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d antibodies changes during the progression of HIV disease, and \u201cbad\u201d, enhancing antibodies become predominant in the advanced stage. This issue was addressed by the elegant study of Subbramanian et al. [43]. These authors measured in parallel the concentrations of virus-neutralizing antibodies (NAs), NA in the presence of complement (C-NA), as well as those of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating (ADCC) antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies in the presence or absence of complement (C-ADE versus FcR-ADE). Antibodies that may control HIV progression (NA, C-NA or ADCC) were found mainly in asymptomatic patients, whereas in AIDS stage, the balance shifted towards infection-enhancing (FcR-ADE or C-ADE) antibodies.",

Similarly, it seems plausible that, similarly to natural infections, they may abrogate the beneficial effect of neutralizing or ADCC-mediating antibodies. Certain data from the SIV-monkey model and HIV vaccine trials indicate that this may indeed occur. Antibodies to the putative SIV infection-enhancing domain diminish the beneficial effects of an SIV gp160 vaccine in Rhesus macaques [42]. Verrier et al. [50] demonstrated that in hyperimmunized Rhesus macaques, whole virus particle-based HIV-1 vaccines can play a facilitator role in the transmission of the virus and/or the evolution of the disease. In a recent passive immunization study, SIV immunoglobulin decreased plasma viremia and delayed disease progression in four monkeys out of six; however, the remaining two animals in the group had higher viral loads in their peripheral blood cells than any other of the 12 control animals, and progressed more rapidly than the controls [51]. In another, recent experiment conducted on Rhesus macaques immunized with a recombinant Varicella\u2013Zoster Virus vaccine expressing HIV gp160, those that received the vaccine raised high amounts of non-neutralizing antibodies and manifested increased levels of SIV replication, more rapid CD4 depletion, and accelerated progression to AIDS, compared with controls. This observation indicates that candidate AIDS vaccines may not simply be either efficacious or neutral; they may also have the potential to be harmful [52].",

            "text": "It seems highly probable that enhancing antibodies may develop in human volunteers immunized with candidate HIV vaccines. For example, complement-dependent enhancing antibodies were detected in two trials: in 11 of 19 volunteers [53], and in 6/24 subjects [54] vaccinated with high dose (640 \u03bcg) of a HIV-1 gp160 candidate vaccine. Indirect evidence indicates that enhancing type antibodies could have developed during recent phase III vaccine trials as well. Gilbert et al. [55] have recently reported on the correlation between immunological responses to the recombinant gp120 vaccine and the incidence of HIV-1 infection in a phase 3 vaccine trial. They found that vaccinees who developed low antibody responses had a slightly, but significantly higher chance of becoming infected, than placebo recipients. In Caucasian recipients, this odds ratio was as high as 2.20 (1.29\u20133.74; p\n = 0.004), and 2.00 (1.22\u20133.29; p\n = 0.006) for MN CD4 blocking and for GNE8 V2-binding antibodies, respectively. On the other hand, even the high antibody response appeared to fail to protect vaccinees against HIV-1 infection. The authors put forward two alternative explanations of their findings: (a) the vaccine induced an immune response that enhanced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in low responders and (b) differing antibody responses to rgp120 merely identified the diverse capabilities of vaccinees to resist HIV-1 infection [55]. In the discussion of their paper, they weighed the relative plausibility of the two explanations, but could not decide. In accordance with the Editorial Comment by Graham and Mascola [56], we would like to discuss the possibility, corroborated by the abundance of literature data summarized above, that antibody-mediated enhancement may develop and can diminish or abrogate the beneficial effects of the vaccine or can even be harmful for vaccinated volunteers. We believe that this risk should be seriously considered during the future development of vaccines.",

We suppose that these findings obtained in HIV-infected persons may have relevance for HIV-1 vaccination trials as well. Based on these assumptions, we would like to put forward four proposals.(1)Since it cannot be excluded that HIV vaccines increase the likelihood of infection, we propose that serum samples obtained from vaccinated and placebo-treated volunteers with breakthrough infections in major vaccine trials be tested for C-ADE and FcR-ADE.(2)In accordance with the proposals of Robinson [38], we also suggest to avoid the inclusion of the whole gp41 or at least the major epitopes for C-ADE on gp41 into HIV vaccines, and to reinvestigate the epitopes responsible for the development of different types of enhancing antibodies. With this approach, it may be possible to develop preventive vaccines with strong neutralizing and weak ADE inducing characteristics.(3)Based on literature data referred to above\u2014indicating that a neutralization assay performed in the presence of complement exhibit much stronger correlations to disease progression than the traditional test, we propose using an alternative to the traditional method for measuring neutralizing antibodies, in order to find an effective vaccine. It is reasonable to assume that measurement of the balance between neutralizing and enhancing antibodies in the presence of complement may reflect also the proportion of protective and anti-protective antibodies present in vaccinees. This method can be easily adapted to animal experiments. Therefore, it may prove useful as early as during the selection of candidate vaccines by eliminating potentially harmful vaccines.(4)We also believe that measurement of the virus production by cells infected with HIV-1 in the presence of antibodies and complement may provide a better immune correlate than we have currently.\n",
