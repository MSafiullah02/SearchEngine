Onset of MS typically occurs during early adulthood, making MS the most common neurological disease affecting people under the age of 30. It is the major cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. The social costs associated with MS are high because of its early age of onset, patients with MS experience an early loss in productivity, they need assistance in performing activities of daily living, and they require immunomodulatory treatments and multidisciplinary health care. Currently, nearly 400,000 people are living with MS in the United States, and in the 1990s, there were at least 250,000 patients with MS in the United States [1].",

In the majority of cases, MS develops in an episodic fashion, with phases of clinical disease followed by recovery. In this form of MS, called relapsing\u2013remitting MS (RRMS), white matter lesions can typically deteriorate to permanent tissue injury that is associated with neural loss and clinical disability. Over time, RRMS patients may develop chronic lesions that promote irreversible axonal injury, resulting in the conversion of RRMS to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). SPMS is characterized by minimal or no intermittent recovery of function [2], [3]. Cognitive impairment is also common in MS, occurring at all stages of disease progression. Dysfunction in free recall from long-term memory, speed of information processing, working memory, and abstract reasoning are frequently observed in MS [4].",

However, basic research in MS has not help explain many disorders associated with MS, such as depression, which is the most frequent psychiatric disorder in MS patients. The cause of depression is multifactorial and is likely associated with psychosocial stress, focal demyelinating lesions, and immune dysfunction. Early intervention in depression can prevent a decline in quality of life that typically characterizes MS patients and has even prevented suicide [6]. Despite advances in reducing clinical symptoms in patients with MS through the use of immunomodulating pharmacotherapy, not all respond well to these treatments, especially when the patient is in SPMS, probably due to disease heterogeneity and multi-local, multi-cell damage throughout not only the white matter [7], [8], but also the gray matter of the central nervous system (CNS). Gray matter involvement has been detected in the earliest stages of MS, and cortical gray matter atrophy has been found to occur at a faster rate than white matter atrophy early in disease progression [9], [10], suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in MS development and progression. This hypothesis challenges current research on MS that has focused on white matter. To deny or confirm this hypothesis, additional research is needed. It argues for the development of new approaches and therapies.",

MS is more likely to strike siblings than the general population, and it is more likely to strike monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins. Recently, whole genome screens were conducted in different populations and identified discrete chromosomal regions potentially harboring MS susceptibility genes [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. However, with the exception of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on 6p21, no single locus generated overwhelming evidence of genetic linkage [21]. These results suggest a complex genetic etiology for MS, including multiple genes of small to moderate effect and probable genetic heterogeneity. On the other hand, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was found to control immune response genes in MS, with HLA associations indicating the involvement of autoimmunity. Further, MS was one of the first diseases proven to be HLA-associated, primarily linked to HLA class II factors [19], [22]. The HLA-DRB1\u204e1501 molecule may explain about 50% of MS cases. Furthermore, CD45 or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type C (PTPRC) has been reported as a candidate in some families with MS, 77C\u2192G PTPRC polymorphism is present and preferentially transmitted in a small subgroup of MS families, which may only be detected with complementary methods of analysis [23].",

            "text": "Recently, large international research collaborations have provided strong evidence for the involvement of the polymorphism of two cytokine receptor genes in MS pathogenesis: the interleukin 7 receptor alpha chain gene (IL7RA) on chromosome 5p13 and the interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain gene (IL2RA (= CD25)) on chromosome 10p15. It is estimated that the C allele of a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs6897932, within the alternative spliced exon 6 of IL7RA is involved in about 30% of MS cases. These investigations indicate that MS has a strong genetic component [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Interestingly, some of these findings (such as HLA-DRB1 and IL2RA) were confirmed by recent pathway and network-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [20]. In GWAS, neural pathways, namely axon guidance and synaptic potentiation, were also over-represented in genes from MS patients. In addition to identifying immunological pathways previously identified, for the first time GWAS described the potential involvement of neural pathways in MS susceptibility. For example, GWAS revealed more comprehensive and extensive immune antigens, cell adhesion, and signaling molecules associated with MS, such as CD4, CD11b, CD58, CD82, ITGB2, and STAT3, as well as glutamate receptors, multimeric scaffold molecular DLG1, and DLG2. Using a pooling-based, genome-wide approach, and high-density, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, GWAS also identified a novel risk locus for MS on chromosome 13, in addition of the HLA class II genes (such as HLA-DRB1) [15].",

A large multicenter clinical trial of glatiramer acetate in primary progressive multiple sclerosis indicates that there exist differences in the rates of clinical diseases between men and women with MS [34]. Sex dimorphism in MS may be explained by the effects of sex chromosomes and of sex steroid hormones on the immune system, blood\u2013brain barrier, and parenchymal CNS cells [35]. Both clinical and experimental studies have found that sex steroid supplementation may be beneficial in MS patients in order to reduce symptoms. Interestingly, beneficial neuroprotective effects of MS were noted in clinical studies for elevated levels of hormones in both female and male hormones (estrogens, progesterone, and androgen), an elevation that could be related to anti-inflammatory actions on the immune system or the CNS or related to direct neuroprotective properties [35], [36], [37]. It should be mentioned that these actions can also be seen in estrogen receptor regulators in animal model [38]. These observations may further stimulate current clinical studies to determine the efficacy of and tolerance to sex steroid therapeutic approaches for MS as well as other related diseases.",

According to some observers, this geographical distribution implicates an environmental disease pathogen that may not be ubiquitously distributed. However, the geographic distribution of MS might also be explained, at least in part, by regional variations in genetic risk factors [22]. Interestingly, residential or occupational exposure of MS patients to sunlight may be associated with a lower mortality rate from MS slower progression with vitamin D mediating this effect [43]. Since ultraviolet radiation is the principal catalyst for endogenous vitamin D3 synthesis in humans, and low levels of vitamin D3 are more common at northern latitudes than at southern latitudes, this may be another reason for persons in southern European countries having lower rates of MS.",

However, the reason for these attacks is largely unknown, although genetic factors may influence immune-mediated inflammation as well as neuronal and glial survival by modulating the MS phenotype [45]. Therefore, autoreactive T cells are thought to be generated in response to the interplay of (environmental) triggers and genetic susceptibility factors. Differentiation of such CD4+ T cells results in pro-inflammatory Th1, Th17 cells and/or regulatory Th2 cells, all of which produce cytokines such as interferon-gamma, IL-17, IL-4 and IL-10. After activation, myelin-specific T cells are able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier via interaction of adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. In the CNS, including the cerebral cortex, reactivation of these T cells involves local APCs. These APCs initiate a detrimental cascade that typically involves the attraction of microglia, macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and plasma cells, which produce myelin-specific antibodies. It may be that, in MS, these tiered mechanisms in combination may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal demyelination, and irreversible tissue damage characterized by axonal loss and gliosis [46], [47], [48]. Recent evidence showed that myelin-specific T cells also recognize neuronal autoantigen in a mouse model of MS, further indicating that multiple autoantigens may be involved in spontaneously developing human MS disease [49].",

In addition, foamy macrophages were occasionally found in some of the clusters. Together, these features strongly suggested that the progression of MS may include a stage that actually precedes what has been termed the traditional reactive MS lesion. Although events that give rise to preactive lesions are still to be identified, oligodendrocyte abnormalities appear to be crucially involved [13]. Importantly, preactive lesions do not always develop into demyelinating lesions. Therefore, preactive lesions in MS may represent early stages in the development of MS lesions. As many of them spontaneously resolve, they are expected to hold important clues to halt the inflammatory demyelinating process in MS [13]. While the activation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms in microglia may favour disease progression, the upregulation of genes involved in anti-inflammatory and antioxidative mechanisms driven by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes may protect the CNS environment and thus limit lesion formation [52], [54], [55]. Interestingly, a dysfunction of mitochondria in lesions as well as in the normal-appearing white and gray matter is increasingly recognized in MS and could be an important determinant of axonal dysfunction and degeneration [56]. Together, these observations indicate that mitochondria and mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant agents may have the potential for the disease, in addition to anti-inflammatory.",

These mediators deplete ATP and perturb mitochondrial function, causing failure of the Na+\u2013K+ ATPase, the enzyme that is responsible for rapidly correcting Na+ and K+ levels and for extruding Na+ from the axon and preventing a pathological influx of Na+ in both resting and active axons [59].",

It has been shown that hypoxia can inhibit Na+\u2013K+ ATPase activity and ROS increases Na+\u2013K+ ATPase degradation [61], [62]. Even in normal-appearing white matter in MS, microarray analysis revealed that transcription factor HIF-1alpha, a key regulator of hypoxia-induced gene regulation, and its downstream genes were significantly and consistently upregulated [52], [54], indicating a hypoxia condition in this area. As shown in studies of anoxia, the high intra-axonal Na+ concentration that results from this failure will cause increased activity of the Na+\u2013Ca2+ exchange channel, with the efflux of Na+ requiring a higher degree of Ca2+ influx [63]. This, in turn, activates intra-axonal proteases, resulting in neurofilament fragmentation and perturbation of axon transport and integrity, ultimately leading to neuronal degeneration [12], [57]. In fact, Na+\u2013K+ ATPase enzymatic activity and distribution were reduced or undetectable in chronic MS patients [64], [65], [66]. It appears that chronically demyelinated axons that lack Na+\u2013K+ ATPase cannot exchange axoplasmic Na+ for K+ and are incapable of nerve transmission. Therefore loss of axonal Na+\u2013K+ ATPase is likely to be a major contributor to continuous neurological decline in chronic stages of MS.",

This is due, at least in part, to changes in environmental signals governing remyelination. In particular, myelin debris within lesions appears to contain powerful inhibitors of precursor cell differentiation [67], [68]. It has been shown that the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) accumulates in demyelinated lesions from patients with MS and in mice with EAE, and that HA can prevent remyelination by inhibiting OPC maturation [69]. Efficient removal of such molecules and myelin debris by macrophages (microglia) and other functional systems may thus facilitate OPCs differentiation and permit successful remyelination of damaged axons. Interestingly, the elimination of myelin debris is extremely efficient in young animals, whereas old animals show very poor clearance of myelin debris [70]. Systemic progesterone administration could reverse partially this age-associated decline in CNS remyelination in male rats [71]. These observations indicate that the inhibitors of remyelination are increased and/or clearance systems are not efficient in aged animals and steroid hormones and tissue/neurotrophic factors may be involved in this process. Further identifying signaling molecules in this network (the myelin sheath and myelin debris) probably represents very promising therapeutic targets for pharmacological strategies aimed at enhancing remyelination.",

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of RNA isolated from blood samples of the experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mice revealed a strong correlation between Atg5 expression and clinical disability. Analysis of protein extracted from the T cells confirmed both the upregulation and post-translational modification of Atg5 genes, the latter of which was positively correlated with EAE severity. Analysis of RNA extracted from T cells isolated by negative selection indicated that Atg5 expression was significantly elevated in patients with active RRMS compared to non-diseased controls. Brain tissue sections from RRMS patients, examined by immunofluorescent histochemistry, suggested that encephalitogenic T cells may be a source of Atg5 expression in MS brains. Together, these data suggest that increased T cell expression of Atg5 may contribute to inflammatory demyelination in MS [79].",

The destruction of proteins is as important as their synthesis for the maintenance of protein homeostasis in cells. In eukaryotes, the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system is responsible for most protein degradation: the small protein ubiquitin acts as a death warrant, tagging and targeting other proteins to the large proteolytic chamber of the proteasome. It is now known that ubiquitin-mediated destruction plays a crucial part in many basic cell functions. Given the central role of UPS in diverse cellular processes, it is not surprising that its dysfunction contributes to neurodegenerative and immunological disorders, either as a primary cause or secondary consequence [80], [81]. Importantly the proteolysis system is ATP-dependent [82], [83]. Recently it has been shown that assembly of the proteasome base is a rapid yet highly orchestrated process, and proteasome regulatory particle is chaperone-mediated [84], [85].",

The classic MBP isoforms are predominantly expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the CNS. A recent in vitro cleavage study determined that MBP, and its splice variants, are highly sensitive to redundant matrix metalloproteinases proteolysis. MT6-MMP (initially called leukolysin), however, was superior over all of the other MMPs in cleaving the MBP isoforms. This study demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinase proteolysis of the MBP and its isoforms is a source of immunogenic peptides in autoimmune MS [88].

The PAR family consists of four members: PAR-1, -3, and -4 as thrombin receptors, and PAR-2 as the trypsin/tryptase receptor. These four members are abundantly expressed in the brain throughout development of MS. The expression of PARs in the brain is differentially upregulated or downregulated under pathological conditions in neurodegenerative disorders, including MS [89]. Noorbakhsh et al. [90] found that PAR2 expression was significantly increased on astrocytes and infiltrating macrophages in human MS and murine EAE CNS white matter. Indeed, PAR2 wild-type mice showed markedly greater microglial activation and T lymphocyte infiltration accompanied by worsened demyelination and axonal injury in the CNS compared to their PAR2 knockout littermates. Enhanced neuropathological changes were associated with a more severe, progressive relapsing disease phenotype in wild-type mice. These studies revealed pathogenic interactions between CNS PAR2 expression and neuroinflammation with ensuing demyelination and axonal injury [90]. Therefore, PARs are capable of mediating either neurodegeneration or neuroprotection in MS as well as other neurodegenerative disorders, and they represent attractive therapeutic targets for treatment of these diseases.",

The origins of EAE date back to the 1920s, when Koritschoner and Schweinburg induced spinal cord inflammation in rabbits by inoculating with tissue from a human spinal cord [94]. Since then, EAE has been developed in many different species, including rodents and primates.

Immunohistochemistry of brain tissues showed that the expression of amyloid precursor protein, a sensitive marker of axonal damage, occurs in axons within acute MS lesions and in the active borders of less acute lesions that had not been identified as MS [106]. Recently, evidence for widespread axonal damage even at the earliest clinical stages of MS has been reported [51], [107], leading to the hypothesis that MS is a neurodegenerative disorder in which axonal injury, neuronal loss, and atrophy of the CNS begin in the earliest stages of the disease and then intensify over time [108], [109], [110], even axonal loss could be found in normal-appearing white matter in a patient with acute MS [111]. Such evidence has called into question the previously long-held hypothesis that axonal pathology is the end-stage result of repeated inflammatory events in MS and argues strongly in favor of early neuroprotective intervention [112], [113].",

The mitochondrial respiratory chain is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of five complexes (complexes I\u2013V); the fifth complex is directly involved in ATP synthesis [114], [115], [116]. The complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are made up of multiple subunits, and all contain proteins encoded by nuclear DNA and mtDNA, except for complex II, which is entirely encoded by nuclear DNA [117], [118]. Neurons are highly dependent on oxidative energy metabolism. Axons, in particular, consume significant amounts of ATP, which it uses primarily to fuel the sodium/potassium ATPase, or sodium pump that functions to remove the sodium ions that enter the axon during impulse activity. Mitochondria are not only the energy factory for cells but also the seat of a number of important cellular functions, including essential pathways of intermediate metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation, steroid metabolism, calcium handling and apoptosis [56], [114], [116], [117]. Of key importance is the role of mitochondria in oxidative energy metabolism. Oxidative phosphorylation generates most of the cell's ATP, and any impairment of the organelle's ability to produce energy can have catastrophic consequences, not only due to the primary loss of ATP, but also due to indirect impairment of downstream events. Moreover, the production of superoxide occurs mostly within the mitochondria, mainly in complexes I and III, TCA cycle and conditionally in complex II [115], [118], [119], [120], [121].",

Further, genetic alterations in uncoupling proteins are reported to be implicated in patients with MS. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a member of the mitochondrial proton transport family that uncouples proton entry to the mitochondria from ATP synthesis. Vogler et al. reported that the UCP2 common \u2212 866G/A promoter polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to MS in a German population. In a study of 1097 MS patients and 462 control subjects, they found the common G allele associated with disease susceptibility (P\n = 0.0015). The UCP2 \u2212 866G allele was correlated with lower levels of UCP2 expression in vitro and in vivo. Thus, UCP2 may contribute to MS susceptibility by regulating the level of UCP2 protein in the CNS and/or in the immune system [130].",

This finding raises the possibility of a shared mitochondrial genetic background between these two autoimmune diseases.

This overlap between the two diseases may be related to the association of MS with an mtDNA haplotype (a set of mtDNA polymorphisms) within which pathogenic LHON mutations preferentially occur [133], [134]. In a recent study, 58 unrelated Bulgarian patients with RRMS and 104 randomly selected healthy individuals were analyzed for the presence of 14 mtDNA polymorphisms determining major European haplogroups as well as three (4216, 14 798, 13 708) secondary LHON mutations. Restriction enzyme analysis, used to screen patients and controls for common haplogroup-associated polymorphisms, showed that each of these changes which occurred in MS patients at a similar rate to control subjects. However, 21 of the 58 patients (36.2%) were positive for the T4 216C mutation, while only 11.3% of the controls carried this mutation (P\n < 0.01; OR = 4.38), suggesting that the 4216C base substitution may be a predisposing marker for MS. These findings also supported the hypothesis that particular mtDNA variants may contribute to the genetic susceptibility of some people with MS [132], [135]. To further study the relationship between LHON and MS, Hwang et al. [136] tested 20 Korean MS patients for the presence of mtDNA mutations at nucleotide (nt) 11778, and nt 14484, 3460, and 15257. However, none of the MS patients exhibited any pathogenic LHON mtDNA mutations. This result is in agreement with that of Japanese MS patients [137]. It may be the case that racial characteristics may influence the association.",

Further, the gene expression study showed an unbalanced gene expression in MS patients [57]. As reduced energy production is a major contributor to Ca2+-mediated axonal degeneration, authors focused on changes in oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitory neurotransmission. Compared with controls, 488 transcripts were decreased and 67 were increased in the MS cortex. Twenty-six nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and the functional activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and III were decreased in the MS motor cortex. Reduced mitochondrial gene expression was specific for neurons. In addition, synaptic components of GABAergic neurotransmission and the density of inhibitory interneuron processes also were decreased in the MS cortex.",

The lack of immunohistochemically detected COX-I is apparent in oligodendrocytes, hypertrophied astrocytes and axons, but not in microglia. These findings suggest that hypoxia-like tissue injury in Pattern III MS lesions may be initiated from mitochondrial impairment. On the other hand, in inactive areas of chronic MS lesions the complex IV activity and mitochondrial mass, judged by porin immunoreactivity, are increased within approximately half of large chronically demyelinated axons compared with large myelinated axons in the brain and spinal cord. The axon-specific mitochondrial docking protein (syntaphilin) and phosphorylated neurofilament-H were increased in chronic lesions [141].

Similar to brain, muscles are also highly dependent on mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism, so it is reasonable that there is a weaker muscle in MS patients, indicating muscle is also one of the targets of MS. In some rare cases, MS could have a mitochondrial myopathy combination, in which MRI showed widespread white matter lesions, muscle biopsy showed ragged red fibres and COX (complex IV) deficiency, Southern blot analysis revealed a large deletion of mtDNA [144].

The mitochondrial permeability transition leads to mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture and the release of apoptotic mediators. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) is thought to consist of the adenine nucleotide translocator, a voltage-dependent anion channel, and cyclophilin D (CyPD, the Ppif gene product), a prolyl isomerase located within the mitochondrial matrix. CyPD is a key regulator of the PTP and they are required for mediating Ca2+- and oxidative damage-induced cell death [145], [146]. In experimental animal MS disease model, EAE mice lacking CyPD showed that neurons missing CyPD, are resistant to oxidative agents thought to be the mediators of axonal degeneration observed in both EAE and MS and have mitochondria that are able to more effectively handle elevated Ca2+. Consistent with this neuronal resistance, animals missing CyPD are able to recover, clinically, following the induction of EAE [109]. These results directly implicate pathological activation of the mitochondrial PTP in the axonal damage occurring during MS, in other word, PTP and mitochondria are the critical target of EAE, perhaps multiple sclerosis.",

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress is an important component in the pathogenesis of MS. The inflammatory environment in demyelinating lesions is conducive to the generation of reactive oxygen species. Macrophages and microglia are known to express myeloperoxidase (MPO) and generate ROS during myelin phagocytosis in the white matter. Recent research involving the cerebral cortex in MS indicates that microglial production of ROS is also likely to be involved in cortical demyelination [153]. Protein kinase C (PKC) could induce an increased production of ROS in mononuclear cells of patients with MS compared to those of controls, and it was predominantly or exclusively generated by PKC activated NADPH oxidase [154]. The concentrations of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (e.g. superoxide, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite) can increase dramatically under conditions such as inflammation, and this can overwhelm the inherent antioxidant defences within lesions. Such oxidative and/or nitrative stress can damage the lipids, proteins and nucleic acids of cells and mitochondria, potentially causing cell death [155]. Oligodendrocytes are more sensitive to oxidative and nitrative stress in vitro than are astrocytes and microglia, seemingly due to a diminished capacity for antioxidant defence, and the presence of raised risk factors. Oxidative and nitrative stress might therefore result in selective oligodendrocyte death, and thereby demyelination in vivo. The reactive species may also damage the myelin sheath, promoting its attack by macrophages/microglia.",

When the ROS/RNS are generated in MS and animal models of MS, products such as superoxide and peroxynitrite are formed that are highly toxic to both glia and neuronal cells. Kalman's group has determined the level of DNA damage in MS patients using 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OH-dG) as an oxidative marker, they found that a significant increase in DNA oxidation within plaques compared to NAWM specimens in MS cerebella. A tendency for increase of oxidative markers in normal-appearing cortical tissues located in the proximity of MS plaques was also observed when compared to those in control cortical specimens [157]. Also, oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and impaired activity of mitochondrial enzyme complexes in MS lesions suggest that inflammation can affect energy metabolism, ATP synthesis, and viability of affected cells [138].",

It is reasonable that some of structurally-damaged myelin proteins are the targets of immune system, which are recognized as foreign antigens.

Micromolar NO rapidly inhibits cytochrome c oxidase in turnover with physiological substrates. The respiratory chain is inhibited by NO, either supplied exogenously or produced endogenously via the NO synthase activation. Inhibition of respiration is reversible, although it remains to be clarified whether reversibility is always full and how it depends on concentration of and time of exposure to NO. At least under hypoxic condition, NO irreversibly inhibits cytochrome oxidase [164]. NO and superoxide radicals combine to form peroxynitrate (ONOO\u2212), which breaks down to form the highly reactive radicals hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide [148].

On the other hand, uric acid, a purine metabolite and peroxynitrite scavenger inhibits blood\u2013CNS-barrier permeability changes, CNS inflammation and tissue damage in EAE and in mice with spinal cord injury [165], [166]. More recently the concentrations of uric acid, purine profile and creatinine in samples of cerebrospinal fluid and serum of MS patients were measured in detail by HPLC [167]. The values of all compounds assayed were significantly higher in both biological fluids of MS patients with respect to values measured in controls. In particular, serum hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid and sum of oxypurines were, respectively, 3.17, 3.11, 1.23 and 1.27-fold higher in these patients than corresponding values recorded in controls. Though differently from what previously reported, these data clearly demonstrate that all purine compounds, including uric acid, are elevated in biological fluids of MS patients. Reinforced by the trend observed for creatinine, this corroborates the notion of sustained purine catabolism, possibly due to imbalance in ATP homeostasis, under these pathological conditions. As observed in other pathological states, uric acid, purine compounds and creatinine, can be considered markers of metabolic energy imbalance rather than of reactive oxygen species, even in MS.",

Four immunomodulatory treatments (glatiramer acetate and three interferon-b preparations) and two immunosuppressants (natalizumab and mitoxantrone) are now approved for the treatment of MS and allow the frequency of attacks to be diminished and the progression of disability to be slowed, at least in the shorten medium-term. In addition, a number of new strategies were developed for the treatment of the disease, such as novel immunomodulators (including antibodies/immunosuppressants), therapeutic strategies targeting leukocyte differentiation molecules, costimulatory molecules, anti-adhesion molecules, chemotaxis, autologous stem cell transplantation, anti-infectious therapies and strategies for neuroprotection neurorepair and remyelination (for detail, see previous reviews [3], [5], [172], [173], [174]). Furthermore, there are good scientific rationales for the use of combination therapy in MS, and the clinical trials are also currently underway to establish the therapeutic efficacy and safety of various combination therapies for MS patients [175]. Recently a small scale, open-label, 7-month trial of combination therapy with intramuscular interferon beta-1a and oral doxycycline, a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, in patients with RRMS was successfully completed [176]. The combination of doxycycline and interferon beta-1a treatment resulted in reductions in contrast-enhancing lesion numbers and posttreatment Expanded Disability Status Scale values (P\n < 0.001 for both). Totally this combination treatment was effective, safe, and well tolerated. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of this combination, more important work is double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in larger cohorts of patients with MS. This hopeful trial may encourage related reasonable combination study in the near future. In EAE animal models, some novel combination or cocktail therapy studies already showed the therapeutic efficacy. For instance, multiple Ag peptides (MAPs) containing 8 PLP (139\u2013151) peptides arranged around a dendrimeric branched lysine core were tested to influence the expression and development of relapsing EAE in SJL mice. The PLP (139\u2013151) MAPs were very efficient agents in preventing the development of clinical disease when administered after immunization. The treatment effect with these MAPs was peptide specific and long lasted over a 60-day observation period [177]. Such effective cocktail agents should be tested in different EAE models (including non-human primate model) prior to clinical patient trial. Hence evaluation of specific combination therapies in the controlled setting of preclinical studies and clinical trials should be a priority in MS research.",

Because of this, many people with MS often seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies to manage their disease symptoms [178]. Results from the literature showed that around 63% of people with MS reported that they used one or more CAM therapies [178], [179]. The major reasons for choosing CAM were as follows: conventional treatment was not effective, anecdotal reports of CAM's help, and doctor referral [178]. Common CAM therapies that people use include dietary modification, nutritional and herbal supplementation, and mind\u2013body therapies, including acupuncture and massage [178], [180]. There is a revival of interest among MS researchers about the therapeutic potential of low-fat diet and essential fatty acid supplementation in MS. The efficacy of specific vitamin supplementation remains unclear. Recently, cannabis and yoga have been studied in more controlled studies and have provided evidence that they may have some benefit [180]. The research on CAM therapies in MS is still exploratory, but considering peoples' interest and common use of these therapies, further research in this area is clearly warranted [180].",

It has been used for several thousands of years and today it is still an important part of the Medicine in China. Interestingly, the Journal of the Integration of Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine showed that the most MS patients could be divided to two main types by syndrome typing according to their clinical manifestations, the Gan-Shen yin-deficiency (GSYD) type and the both yin-yang deficiency (YYD) type [181]. They found that the age of first attack was later, level of MBP in cerebrospinal fluid was higher, in the YYD type than those in the GSYD type. Besides, the relapsing time in GSYD type, and the blood\u2013brain barrier index and level of MBP in YYD type showed an ascending trend (P\n = 0.056, 0.074, 0.093, respectively). The distinguishing and classification of patients with MS is the first step for treatment of patients with the disease by using TCM. However, more important issue is randomized, well-controlled clinical trial on the MS patients. This is a difficult task but it should be completed as soon as possible. On the other hand, the existed immunological difference between the MS patients of GSYD type and those of YYD type indicates that traditional Chinese medicine has scientific basis even it is not fully understood. Recently, an Iranian herbal-marine medicine, MS14, was reported to ameliorates experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in mice [182]. Hence the CAM exploration of both basic and clinical study is widely performed and it would be expected to provide more useful therapeutic agents for treatment of MS patients.",

Current treatments for MS include immunomodulatory agents but no neuroprotective or regenerative therapy is available. Especially not all patients with MS respond well to treatment with these agents. From various animal models, we have learned that remyelination in the CNS is a potent neuroprotective mechanism [183]. The knowledge about oligodendrocyte biology and the process of remyelination has greatly increased in recent years [58], [184], [185], [186]; however, the precise mechanisms are far from being understood, and remyelination, neurogeneration as well as neuroprotection occur only in animal models. Although remyelination is, in principle, also possible in the diseased MS brain, it is not clear why it fails in many MS patients. The clinical trials performed so far either failed to show an effect or were insufficient in design. Thus, further knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of the repair processes and MS pathophysiology is required to achieve the ultimate goal of a neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatment in MS.",

Multiple pathways of DNA repair have been elucidated for nuclear DNA. However, it appears that only base excision repair is functioning in mitochondria [190]. This repair pathway is responsible for the removal of most endogenous damage including alkylation damage and oxidative damage. Interestingly, astrocytes exhibit efficient repair, whereas, other glial cell types and neuronal cells exhibit a reduced ability to remove lesions from mtDNA [190]. A strategy of targeting DNA repair proteins to mitochondria to enhance mtDNA repair capacity was developed [190], [191]. Enhancement of mtDNA repair in oligodendrocytes provided protection from reactive oxygen species- and cytokine-induced apoptosis. These experiments provide a novel strategy for protecting sensitive CNS cells and thus provide new treatment options for neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that neurotrophic factors influence proliferation, differentiation, survival, and regeneration of mature oligodendrocytes and oligodendroglial precursors in favor of a myelin repair. Since myelin breakdown is often severe in MS, the possibility of growth factors use in the treatment of MS has been considered and recently, some have been shown to reduce lesion severity and promote myelin regeneration in EAE [196], [197]. To investigate the role of endogenous CNTF in inflammatory demyelinating disease, MOG-induced EAE in CNTF-deficient and wild-type C57BL/6 mice was studied. Disease was more severe in CNTF-deficient mice and recovery was poor, with a 60% decrease in the number of proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells and a more than 50% increase in the rate of oligodendrocyte apoptosis. In addition, vacuolar dystrophy of myelin and axonal damage were more severe in CNTF-deficient mice. These specific pathological features could be prevented by treatment with an antiserum against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting that endogenous CNTF may counterbalance this effect of TNF-\u03b1 [198]. Hence CNTF modulates, in an inflammatory environment, glial cell survival and is an outcome determinant of EAE and it may be a hopeful agent for treatment of MS patients. More recently the neuroprotective role of CTNF was confirmed by overexpression of CNTF in EAE mice, possibly by exerting their immunoregulatory activity, inhibiting inflammation, reducing demyelination, and stimulating oligodendrogenesis [199].",

Notably remyelination is regulated by stimulators and inhibitors [69], [184], [200]. Leucine-rich repeats and Ig domain-containing, neurite outgrowth inhibitor receptor-interacting protein-1 (LINGO-1) is a potent negative regulator of axonal myelination. Loss of LINGO-1 function by Lingo1 gene knockout or by treatment with an antibody antagonist of LINGO-1 function leads to functional recovery from EAE. This remyelination role is associated with enhanced OPCs differentiation. Therefore antagonism of LINGO-1 or its pathway is a promising approach for the treatment of MS [201], [202].",

The beneficial effect of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (LA) on these phenomena has been investigated [205]. Interestingly, LA dose-dependently prevented the development of clinical signs in a rat model for MS, and clinical improvement was coupled to a decrease in leukocyte infiltration into the CNS, in particular monocytes. Live cell imaging assessed that ROS are produced within minutes upon the interaction of monocytes with brain endothelium. Monocyte adhesion to an in vitro model of the BBB subsequently induced enhanced permeability, which could be inhibited by LA. Hence LA has a protective effect on EAE not only by affecting the migratory capacity of monocytes, but also by stabilization of the BBB, making LA an attractive therapeutic agent for the treatment of MS.",

Recently we discovered a potential direct interaction between neuropeptide CART and subunit B of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB). We found that CART significantly increased SDH function, mt complex II activity and ATP generation in purified mitochondria and primary cultured neurons. Furthermore, pretreatment with CART enhanced mitochondrial mechanisms of neuronal survival and prevented the decline in SDH and CII activities and ATP production after OGD. The findings suggest that CART's neuroprotective mechanism of action may be linked to preservation of mitochondrial function and prevention of energy failure after ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury [206]. Importantly, CART has a transcription activity and stimulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor production in cultured neuronal cells [207], [208]. More recently we found that CART has a protective role in a mouse EAE model (unpublished data). This observation further indicates that mitochondrial-targeted neuroprotection benefit EAE and probably MS patients.",

The Ginkgo group also exhibited less fatigue at follow-up compared with the placebo group. This exploratory pilot study also showed that no adverse events or side effects were reported. Therefore Ginkgo exerted modest beneficial effects on select functional measures (e.g., fatigue) among some individuals with MS.

Several cellular mechanisms have been proposed, including genetic factors, viral infections, autoimmune attack, demyelination, mitochondrial dysfunction, free radicals production, ionic imbalance and cellular clearance system dysfunction leading to final neuron loss. These factors work either as a primary cause or secondary consequence, however in many cases they work together to cause the MS disease. On-going efforts across world in searching genetic loci that may cause vast majority of patients with MS may provide some important clues to understand the disease process. Given the central role of the mitochondria in many important cellular functions including energy production, it is reasonable that its dysfunction is the key contributor to neurodegenerative process of this disease. We propose that the inflammation may be initiated by infection or by intrinsic imbalance (such as cellular energy failure and increased oxidative stress in neurons or oligodendrocytes), and tissue response to this inflammation that controlled by DNA defects (in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes) in MS patients. Therefore, mitochondrial-targeted and neuroprotective treatments, or combination of neuroprotection and immunomodulatory may represent new and correct approach of MS therapy.",
