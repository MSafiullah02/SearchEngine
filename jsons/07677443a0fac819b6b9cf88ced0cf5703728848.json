Throughout the middle ages, several descriptions of dermatophytosis were produced where it is described as 'tinea'. The keratin-destroying moths which made circular holes in the woollen garments are known as Tinea. Due to similarity in the structure of circular lesion of dermatophytosis on the smooth skin with the circular hole made by moth, Cassius Felix introduced the term 'tinea' to describe the lesions. In 1806, Alibert used the term 'favus' to describe the honey-like exudate in some scalp infections. However, the fungal aetiology of tinea was first detected by Robert Remak, a Polish physician who first observed the presence of hyphae in the crusts of favus. This detection is also a landmark in medical history because this is the first description of a microbe causing a human disease. He himself did not publish his work, but he permitted the reference of his observations in a dissertation by Xavier Hube in 1837. Remak gave all the credits of his discovery to his mentor Schoenlein who first published the fungal etiological report of favus in 1839. He observed the infectious nature of the favus by autoinoculation into his own hands and also successfully isolated the fungus later (1945) and",

The mammalian immune system has pattern recognition receptors (dectin-2, chi-lectins) which identify fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) such as mannan and chitin. The mannan-dectin interaction can upregulate the pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF\u03b1) production by macrophages. However, relationship between the chitin recognition and development of innate or adaptive immune response is not established. The antimicrobial peptide such as cathelicidin plays a role to limit the invasion of dermatophytes. During atopic dermatitis the level of cathelicidin is decreased which helps in invasion of dermatophytes. The fungal hyphae can activate complement via the alternative pathway and generate chemotactic factors for neutrophils. Further, during fungal invasion of keratin layer, the keratinocytes release IL8 which also attracts neutrophils in the stratum corneum. The neutrophils and monocytes can ingest and kill the spores of T. rubrum. For development of adaptive immune response, the dermatophyte antigens are trapped and processed by the skin Langerhans' cells in the epidermis. The Langerhans' cells present the antigens in MHC class II restricted fashion to T cells in the lymph nodes draining the skin. The migration of Langerhans' cells for antigen presentation is initiated by the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In calves, experimentally infected with T. verrucosum, influx of different immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were observed. The protective role of Th2-mediated immune response producing anti-Trichophyton antibodies in calves is questionable. In human, Th2-mediated response produces IL4 which induces antibody class switching to IgG4 and IgE, associated with immediate hypersensitivity (IH) reaction (wheal and flare reaction). The IH reaction is often detected in chronic infection which also indicates the inefficiency of humoural immunity in offering protection.",

For suspected onychomycosis, the nails should be cleaned with alcohol and affected nail bed should be exposed by removing the onycholytic nail plate with a nail clipper. The subungual hyperkeratotic material should be collected with a scalpel or curette. They are wrapped in brown paper (or coloured paper) and are kept in a tight container preferably without moisture for transport into the laboratory. 4.1.14.2 Laboratory Examination 1. Direct examination: The skin scrapings, hair including the hair bulb, nail fragments can be observed under microscope by wet mount with 10 % KOH preparation. The digestion of keratin with the KOH can be speed up with heat. An alternative preparation is 20 % KOH with 36 % DMSO that provides rapid diagnosis without heating and the specimens can be preserved for long time. The hyphae are observed under the microscope invading the hair and producing arthrospores. There are two types of hair invasion by the dermatophytes, known as ectothrix and endothrix invasion. In ectothrix invasion, the arthrospores are observed on the surface of the hair, whereas in endothrix invasion, the spores are found within the hair. There are some Trichophyton species also which cannot attack the hair. The different Trichophyton species associated with hair invasion are enlisted in Table 4 .5. The specimens can be stained with chlorazol black or Parkers blue ink.

It binds fungal cell wall and increases the visibility of fungal hyphae and spores. 2. Isolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. 3. Histopathology: The histopathological slides are prepared with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Grocott methenamine silver and calcofluor white (CFW) stains. The histopathological section shows the dead and degenerating mycelium with cellular debris at the centre of the lesion with well preserved hyphae at the periphery of the lesion. In T. schoenleinii infection, the 'scutulum' (concave, cup-shaped yellow crust) is observed on the atrophic epidermis. Inflammation with roundcell infiltrate is seen in the adjacent dermis. In comparison to direct microscopy histopathological investigation is much reliable, although it cannot detect the species of dermatophyte. The diagnostic sensitivity can be increased with biopsy which is not always possible to conduct especially in human patients suffering with diabetes. 4. Molecular biology: The conventional PCR have developed for identification of different Trichophyton species using nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), chitin synthase 1 (chs1), topoisomerase II (TOP2) genes, small (18S rRNA) and large subunit (28S rRNA) of ribosomal RNA as major target genes. Further, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), PCR fingerprinting, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and sequencing of microsatellite markers, have been successfully applied to species identification in dermatophytes but were mostly unable to discriminate between the strains. The sequencing of the internaltranscribed spacer (ITS) region is commonly used for phylogenetic analysis and identification of dermatophyte species. Although, the ITS region shows high sequence similarities between the species of Trichophyton (90-100 %), the discriminating polymorphisms (barcode sequence) exists in ITS1 and ITS2 region of the members of T. tonsurans and T. equinum. In addition, non-transcribed spacer (NTS) region of the rRNA genes is also considered suitable for strain typing of some Trichophyton species, such as T. rubrum, T. interdigitale and T. tonsurans. Recent progress includes the use of PCR-ELISA which can specifically identify the PCR amplified product with the help of enzyme labelled probe producing colour reaction in positive cases. The uniplex-PCR-ELISA can identify T. rubrum, T. interdigitale, T. tonsurans and T. violaceum individually. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) can identify the species of Trichophyton from the grown cultures which is very fast and specific method and the result shows 98-99 % similarity with PCR.

He also described the sexual form of Microsporum gypseum as Gymnoascus gypseum. Griffin validated the Nannizzi's investigations and confirmed the existence of the sexual phase of Microsporum. This sexual stage was renamed as Nannizzia in the name of Nannizzi. In1934, Emmons first classified the dermatophytes into three genera, i.e. Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton. This description is till date considered as the standard system of classification for dermatophytes. Bodin first described two species of Microsporum such as M. canis and M. gypseum. Kligman (1952) described the epidemics of tinea capitis due to Microsporum audouinii which was known as the Atlantic City board epidemic among the school children.",

The fungi can also act as opportunistic pathogen of plants and animals including human. In the saprophytic phase, they are present either as mycelium or a heavily melanised survival structures called sclerotia. In favourable environment, they produce conidiophores with conidia which are transmitted by air or any other means into the plants. After the establishment of the infection in the susceptible host, aflatoxins are produced. It is most prevalent in warm regions, especially between latitudes 35 N and 35 S.

The conidia are engulfed by tracheal epithelial cells, alveolar type II cells and nasal epithelial cells. Most of them are killed by the phago-lysosome, although the remaining conidia are capable to germinate and exit the phago-lysosome.

In immunosuppressed animals having defective alveolar macrophage function, the conidia are able to escape the phago-lysosome-mediated killing. The virulence factors of Aspergillus such as melanin, rodlets and superoxide dismutase can protect the conidia from reactive oxygen species. Other blood cells such as platelets can also damage the A. fumigatus conidia by releasing serotonin. The conidia which survive from this first line of defence can germinate. The germination involves conidial swelling (isotropic growth) followed by protrusion of germ tube (polar growth). The polar growth occurs along with mitotic nuclear division followed by a septum formation at the base of the germ tube. Several such septi are formed after completion of each mitotic cycle to create elongating hyphae which can invade the tissues. This germination depends on nutrient sensing, acquisition and biosynthetic pathways for obtaining the nutrients from the host. Under the nutrient-limited condition and other stress factors, the protein-folding capacity of the fungal endoplasmic reticulum reaches its maximum limit and the unfolded protein response (UPR) initiates. The enzymes such as elastase, aspartic proteinase, serine protease and metalloprotease produced by Aspergillus help in the breakdown of host tissue for nutrient acquisition and invasion. For survival and virulence of the fungi in vivo, there is a requirement for biosynthesis of uracil/uridine, folate and lysine. Aspergilli can also utilise a wide range of nitrogen sources in which environmental nitrate is taken and converted into ammonium and subsequently glutamine and glutamate. They degrade the host proteins to obtain amino acids and other nutrients or they can synthesise the amino acids from carbon-and nitrogen-containing precursors. This synthesis is regulated by cross pathway control (cpcA) locus. A. fumigatus can also uptake the iron with the help of siderophores or through the reductive iron assimilation. Besides nutritional requirements, A. fumigatus also adapts with the in vivo environment by the expression of different factors such as pH regulator (PacC) for adaptation in alkaline pH, sterolregulatory element-binding protein (SrbA) for adaptation in hypoxic condition, etc. Production of different toxins such as gliotoxin, ribotoxins and haemolysin also help in the establishment of infection by preventing cellular effector function and causing cellular apoptosis.",

Haematogenous dissemination of the hyphae into vital organs may take place. During angioinvasion, thrombosis and infarction occur creating a necrotic focus (plaque) where the fungi can grow. The hyphae are not effectively phagocytosed by the macrophages due to their larger size. The neutrophils aggregate around the hyphae and damage them by reactive oxygen species and a variety of antimicrobial compounds such as proteases, defensins, lysozyme and lactoferrin released from their granules. The neutrophils can also inhibit the hyphal growth by the lactoferrin sequestration of iron, an essential nutrient for fungal growth.

Horses Keratomycosis It is characterised by corneal opacity, ulceration and formation of endothelial plaques in the centre of the cornea (\u03b2-glucan, GM, chitin) act as ligand (pathogenassociated molecular pattern, PAMP). The soluble receptors act as opsonin which enhances phagocytosis by the alveolar macrophages. Pentraxin (PTX3) specifically binds the conidia (not hyphae) and enhances their phagocytosis by dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages. After the compatible binding of the fungi and cell-associated PRRs, the cytoplasmic tail attached with the receptors which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM)-like motif gets phosphorylated. This phosphorylation activates several pathways to stimulate the phagocytes for killing of the conidia through the production of NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS). The phosphorylation also activates the NF\u03baB and stimulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL12, TNF\u03b1). The cytokines help in the recruitment of the immune cells at the site of the infection. Further, A. fumigates hyphae (not conidia), through the production of ROS, can stimulate NLRP3 inflammasome to release active IL1\u03b2 which can recruit more amount of neutrophils. These neutrophils produce a neutrophil entrapment traps (NETs) to engulf the larger hyphae which are not phagocytosed by the macrophages. The innate immune system also influences the subsequent development of T cell-mediated adaptive response. The adaptive response is initiated with the dendritic cells which can engulf the conidia or hyphae to carry them into the draining lymph nodes. The conidial engulfment occurs through the 'coiling phagocytosis' in which the dendritic pseudopods rotate around the conidia to form a layer following the binding of the mannose receptor DC-SIGN and complement receptor 3 (CR3). Whereas the hyphal engulfment occurs through 'zipper phagocytosis' after the binding of Fc receptor (as ligand) and complement receptor 3 (CR3), this kind of phagocytosis occurs following the contour of the fungi which further activates the IL4-producing CD4 T cells in the spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes. The dendritic cells can also recognise the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) of the fungi through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) to activate the T cells. The epithelial cells in addition express the pattern recognition receptors for fungal recognition and as a consequence induce the T cell tolerance.",

Th17 cell activation correlates with Aspergillus infection during immunodeficiencies. The Th17 cells secrete IL17 and IL22 which recruits neutrophils. Further, fungal growth, inflammatory immunity and tolerance to Aspergillus are controlled by the activation of natural (n) Treg cells. This kind of Treg cells can suppress the neutrophils through the combined actions of IL10 and CTLA4 acting on dendritic cells to produce indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO).

Pulmonary infection produces either acute or chronic pneumonia. The acute pneumonic patients show fever, chills and productive purulent cough, with or without haemoptysis. The patients with chronic pneumonia show weight loss, night sweats, fever and cough with sputum production. The extrapulmonary infection is characterised by skin lesions which are either verrucous (raised lesion with sharp and irregular border) or ulcerative, osteomyelitis, prostatitis, orchitis and meningitis are also demonstrated by the negative staining with the Diff-Quik (DQ) stain which demonstrates the unstained yeast cells present in the stained background. Since they are not commensal and colonisation does not occur so their detection in direct smear establishes the diagnosis, and it is considered as most rapid diagnostic technique for blastomycosis. However, negative finding is inconclusive as 37-46 % of human blastomycosis patients reveal the presence of Blastomyces in direct smear. 2. Isolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. It is the most sensitive and gold standard method for diagnosis of blastomycosis. However, the mycelial form is highly infectious, and the caution should be taken in handling of the culture in the laboratory and it is a time-consuming process causing delay in diagnosis. The confirmation of culture can be done by conversion of yeast phase into the mould phase, PCR and commercially available DNA probe. 3. Histopathology: In the clinical specimens such as saliva or sputum, fine needle aspirates and formalin-fixed tissues, the classical look of the Blastomyces yeasts such as round to oval multinucleate cells with a single broadbased bud located intra or extracellularly helps in diagnosis. The tissue sections are stained with haematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS), PAS with haematoxylin counter stain and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS). If the classical look is not detected, then the diagnosis becomes difficult as it produces confusion with other yeasts. In such cases, the mucicarmine stain can differentiate the Cryptococcus neoformans and Blastomyces as it can specifically stain the capsule present surrounding the Cryptococcus cells. Melanin stain can also differentiate Blastomyces from other yeasts. The Alcian blue or acid-fast stain can be used for differentiation between Blastomyces and Coccidioides immitis. Blastomyces is weakly positive, whereas Coccidioides immitis is negative. In situ hybridisation with specific probe can diagnose Blastomyces within the tissues. 4. Detection of antigen: In human, the ELISAbased kits are available to detect the Blastomyces antigen (A-antigen) in urine, cerebrospinal fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Sometimes it produces crossreaction with Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum due to the presence of shared carbohydrate fraction of A-antigen. Currently BAD1 is the antigenic target having no crossreaction with Histoplasma as it does not contain carbohydrate. Detection of \u03b2-D-glucan (BDG) is not so effective in blastomycosis.",

The protease present in the spherule can digest the antibody or other opsonins to evade phagocytosis. Further, the spherules showed moderate resistance against reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide produced by the host macrophages. The spherules also inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) by the host phagocytes. So, even after phagocytosis, they can inhibit the oxygenmediated killing. However, the spherule outer wall glycoprotein (SOWGp) can bind antibody to enhance opsonisation and subsequent phagocytosis. The peak of SOWGp production occurs during isotropic growth of the spherule but then suddenly decreases during endospore formation.

Influenza-like, pneumonic and pleural presentations are the most common. The disseminated form is noticed causing tissue damage in the skin, bone, joints and central nervous system to bind and internalise the spherules. It is followed by production of a T cell-mediated response because they can elevate the T cell co-stimulatory molecule production. The PAMP-PRR interactions stimulate the production of IL12 and IL23 which can convert the naive T cells into antigen-specific T cell populations. There are two functionally distinct subsets of CD4+ T cells, i.e. Th1 and Th2 cells. Both clinical and experimental evidence have demonstrated that Th1-mediated immunity is essential for defence against coccidioidomycosis. The activation of Th1 cells will increase the level of IFN\u03b3, IL2 and other cytokines which provides the signals for recruiting and activating immune effector cells, whereas the activation of Th2 response increases the antibody level such as serum IgG, IgE and IgA which does not offer any protection. 4.6.14 Diagnosis 4.6.14.1 Clinical Specimens The clinical specimens for diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis include pus or exudates from lesion, transtracheal washes, skin scrapings and biopsies from lymph node, bone, etc. In human, the specimens include sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, transtracheal aspirates and lung biopsies. All specimens should be labelled as potentially hazardous during transport. 4.6.14.2 Laboratory Examination 1. Direct examination: The wet mounts with 10 % KOH are employed on the clinical specimen for detection of the spherule with endospores which is diagnostic of coccidioidomycosis. The presence of immature spherule or endospores without spherule may be confused with other fungal infection. The calcofluor white (CFW) fluorescent stain offers best detection of the fungi by binding the chitin and cellulose of the cell wall. However, it can also nonspecifically stain the plant and fatty substances. 2. Isolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. However, Coccidioides is extremely hazardous to handle, and several cases of infection from the laboratories are documented through inhalation of arthroconidia. It is also considered as a 'select agent' of bioterrorism. So, Coccidioidesspecific laboratory should have biosafety level 3 containment maintained with negative air pressure. Further, expertise is needed in handling of the colonies because the arthroconidia are easily generated. However, the routine laboratory where suspected culture of Coccidioides is handled should have minimum biosafety level 2 facilities. All the cultures are handled under class II biological safety cabinet containing vertical laminar airflow with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter and exhaust air.

The glucan (Glc) and N-acetylglucosamine persists as a polymer (\u03b2-1,4 linkage) known as 'chitin'. Two different glycosidic linkages (\u03b1 and \u03b2) are present in the glucan structure of both yeast and mycelium. An \u03b1-glucan contains \u03b1-(1, 3)-glucosyl linear residues, while \u03b2-glucan consists of a linear \u03b2-(1, 3)-glucosyl-linked backbone with \u03b2-(1, 6)-glucosyl-linked side chains that vary in length and distribution. Especially in the yeast cells of Histoplasma, the chitin forms the inner layer with an outer fibrous covering made of \u03b1-glucan, whereas the mycelial form is predominantly made of \u03b2-glucan. Based on this chitin and \u03b1-glucan concentration, H. capsulatum is classified as chemotype I and II. The chemotype II strains consist of less chitin and more glucan than chemotype I. Further, concentration of \u03b1-glucan is associated with virulence of the strains. The virulent H. capsulatum strains may possess 1,000-fold more \u03b1-glucan than nonpathogenic strains. Sometimes H. capsulatum produces nonpathogenic strains lacking the \u03b1-glucan in their cell wall. They may produce an unusual morphology and can persist within the macrophages for prolonged period, observed in chronic animal and human infections. The \u03b1-glucan is found to be associated with multiplication of yeast cells within the macrophages, maintenance of yeast cells within phagolysosome and blocking of innate immune recognition of H. capsulatum by a particular receptor.",

In addition, changes in chemical composition of the cell wall are also noted. In yeast phase, the \u03b1-glucan content of the cell wall is increased than the mycelial phase as discussed earlier and also the changes occurred in lipid composition of the membrane due to adaptation in higher temperature (37 C). Some phase-specific virulence factors are expressed by H. capsulatum yeast cells such as CBP1, Yps 3 and Yps 21:E9. The sulphur metabolism can influence the morphotype in H. capsulatum. Addition of sulfhydryl-reducing agent (dithiothreitol) fixes cells in the yeast phase independent of temperature, whereas the addition of sulfhydryl-oxidising agents (p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, PCMS) fixes cells in the mycelial phase independent of temperature. The enzyme hybrid histidine kinase (DRK1) regulates this phenotypic switch in H. capsulatum. It acts as a sensor in the change of environmental temperature and regulates the expression of the genes for yeast phase-specific virulence factors like CBP1, AGS1 and Yps-3. This phenotypic change is reversible and blocking the transition may prevent the disease progression. H. capsulatum is also divided into phylogenetically distinct lineages/clades based on geographical distribution. The major clades are North American class 1 (Nam1), North American class 2 (Nam2), Eurasian, Latin American group A (LamA), Latin American group B (LamB), Australian, Netherlands (Indonesian) and African.",

Humid climate, temperature ranging from 25 to 35 C and neutral to alkaline pH are required for their optimum growth. Sometimes darkness favours the sporulation and mycelial phase requires Ca ++ for their growth. The bird droppings and bat guano can enrich their growth with nitrogen supplementation.

Most of the human outbreaks occur when they disturb the soil of old bird roosting site or they visit bat-inhabited caves for adventure or tour.

H. capsulatum var. capsulatum follows different strategies to survive within the phago-lysosome. They can increase the pH of the phago-lysosome with the help of urease and release of ammonia or bicarbonate, although it is not established whether they inhibit or reverse the lowering of pH. It also prohibits the accumulation of vacuolar ATPase/proton pump required for maintenance of H + . Thus, they elevate the pH of the phago-lysosome up to 6.5, optimum for iron acquisition from transferrin with the help of siderophores and lowering the action of lysosomal hydrolase. Calcium-binding protein released by the yeasts also lowers the lysosomal enzyme capacity by chelation of calcium. Other virulence factors such as catalase B, betaglucosidase and melanin help in the survival of the yeast cells within macrophages as described in Table 4 .18. The infected macrophages enter the lymph nodes and spread subsequently through haematogenous route. In the absence of a protective cellular immunity, the disease with dissemination may occur. Sometimes the yeasts remain dormant in the host throughout their life and rejuvenate to produce disease during impairment of host immunity. 4.7.10.2 H. capsulatum var. farciminosum After transmission into the host, the exact mode of dissemination especially at the cellular level is unexplored. It causes suppurating lesions in the skin of limbs and neck associated with the lymphatics followed by the development of ulcer and enlargement of the lymphatics with tortuous cord formation. In mucosal form of the disease, lesions are observed in the nasal passage, pharynx, larynx, trachea, lung and genitalia with possibility of venereal transmission. In ocular form, conjunctivitis, keratitis, papule formation in conjunctiva or nictitating membrane is found.",

Seeber described the similarities of the organism with Coccidioides immitis. Accordingly, Robert Wernicke, advisor of Seeber, named the organism as Coccidioides seeberia or Coccidium seeberi in 1900. In 1903, O'Kineley first described the histological changes caused by the organism which were isolated from India. Minchin and Fantham (1905) further studied O'Kineley's Indian isolates and named the organism as Rhinosporidium kinealyi. The earliest evidence of animal infection was noted by Theiler (1906) in South Africa in a horse. Later, similar organism from the horses was reported by ZSchokke (1913) in South Africa, who also named them as Rhinosporidium equi. Ashworth (1923) revised all the nomenclature proposals and finally concluded Rhinosporidium seeberi as the name of the pathogen. Thus, the different names such as Rhinosporidium ayyari (isolated from buffalo), Rhinosporidium hylarum and Rhinosporidium amazonicum are currently known as R. seeberi.",

Primary juvenile sporangium (trophocyte) is a thinwalled structure with a single nucleus, nucleolus and granular cytoplasm containing mitochondria. The cytoplasm also contains endoplasmic reticulum, lipid-rich globules and vacuoles. The cell wall is unilamellar in nature with a fibrillar capsule of electron-dense material. This juvenile sporangium undergoes the sequential morphological changes to produce immature, intermediate, early mature and mature sporangia. The intermediate sporangia (70-150 \u03bcm) contain thickened bilamellar cell wall made of chitin (thinner electron-dense outer wall and thicker translucent inner wall), several nuclei, several flat cristae mitochondria and an early pore. The cytoplasm condenses around each of the nucleus to develop endospores (4-10 \u03bcm in diameter), and the sporangium with such endospores is known as early mature sporangia. The mature sporangium is a large (up to 400 \u03bcm) spherical body containing hundreds of mature and immature endospores and a pore or operculum. It is enclosed within a thin cell wall with three prominent inner layers. The mature endospores are located near the centre and towards the pore, whereas the immature endospores are located at the opposite pole of the sporangium (germinative zone) (Fig. 4.16) . The mature endospores contain a bilaminated thin cell wall (1-3 \u03bcm), 15-20 spherical (1-3 \u03bcm in diameter) electron-dense bodies (EDB), nucleus with nucleolus, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The electron-dense bodies either act as nutrient reservoir or precursor of endosporulated sporangia and they are known as 'spore-morula'.",

Another explanation states that due to high antigenicity of the sporangia, anti-sporangia antibodies are developed by the host defence system.

Further studies revealed its eukaryotic nature and claimed its morphological similarities with Chytridiales group of fungi. However, comparative studies by other workers showed certain morphological dissimilarities especially in the cell wall structure between R. seeberi and prototype member of Chytridiales.

The pathogenic potentiality was recognised later when the human infection (rhinocerebral zygomycosis) due to Zygomycetes was detected in Germany by Platauf (1885) . He described the infection as 'mycosis mucorina'. The sketches drawn by Paltauf to describe the etiological agent were more similar with Rhizopus than Mucor. In 1943, similar kinds of human cases, affecting meninges and central nervous system, were reported from patients with diabetes mellitus. Bauer et al. (1955) first isolated the major etiologic agent of rhinocerebral zygomycosis, i.e. Rhizopus arrhizus (R. oryzae). Baker (1957) coined the term 'mucormycosis' to describe Zygomycetes infection. Clark (1968) restricted the term 'mucormycosis' for the infection produced by Mucorales and introduced the term 'Entomophthoromycosis' to describe subcutaneous phycomycosis caused by Entomophthorales fungi. Chick et al. (1958) first described amphotericin B as a therapeutic agent for human zygomycosis experimentally produced in rats with the inoculation of Rhizopus arrhizus (R. oryzae).",

The toll-like receptors (TLR 2) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRR) present in the phagocytes can interact with the fungal patterns (PAMP) in the spores or hyphae. The interaction can transmit the intracytoplasmic signal for pro-inflammatory cytokine release and activation of antifungal activities of the phagocytes.

The study indicated that in comparison to Aspergillus fumigatus, the R. oryzae spores are less killed by healthy human neutrophils, whereas the magnitude of cytokine release (IL6, IL8, TNF\u03b1) from blood monocytes is more in R. oryzae-induced cells than A. fumigatus. The probable reason is that the cell wall of R. oryzae contains more chitin than other fungi which is considered as a potent PAMP for the phagocytes.

The capsule can be best observed in fresh preparations by staining with diluted India ink or phase contrast microscopy. Giemsa can also partially stain the capsule. In tissue section, it can be viewed with mucicarmine or Alcian blue stain. The capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans consists primarily of two polysaccharides, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal), along with smaller amounts of mannoproteins. In addition to being associated with the cell, these molecules are also shed as an exopolysaccharide. It is noticed that the Ca ++ acts as the bridge between the negatively charged glucuronic acid residues of neighbouring GXM fibres, mediating capsule assembly through GXM-GXM aggregation. So in absence of Ca ++ , there is increased GXM shedding, and in the presence of EDTA the capsule size is decreased. The assembly of capsule is also influenced by the cell wall composition present beneath it. The cells without \u03b1 (1, 3)-glucan in their cell walls do not display the surface capsule, whereas the cells lacking cell wall \u03b2 (1, 3) glucan form larger capsules than those of wild-type cells. Two major transcription factors, namely, cryptococcal Nrg1 and Cir1, play central role in regulation of the capsule formation. Recently seven more transcriptional regulators that affect capsule size are also elucidated (Gat201, Tup1, Gcn5, Rim101, Hap3, Hap5 and Ada2). The capsule size is increased with iron deprivation, increased CO 2 concentration and the presence of serum in vitro and increased age of the organism or duration of infection in vivo.",

The reported genome sequence of two related strains of C. neoformans serotype D (JEC21 and B-3501A) revealed a 19-Mb genome sequence (excluding the ribosomal RNA repeats) which spans 14 chromosomes from 762 kb to 2.3 Mb. A total of 6572 protein-encoding genes were identified, which contain an average of 6.3 exons of 255 bp and 5.3 introns of 67 bp. There was no evidence of whole genome duplication. Overall 65 % of the genes of C. neoformans are conserved, 10 % of the genes are unique to C. neoformans and the remaining 25 % have non-fungal sequences. There are total 11 gene families, among them 2 are exclusive for C. neoformans, one encodes protein required for capsule formation and the other encodes nucleotide sugar epimerases associated with cell wall formation. Approximately 5 % of the genome is constituted with transposons clustered in single blocks (40-100Kb) that may represent sequence-independent regional centromeres. Each block contains Tcn5 and Tcn6 transposons. The transposons are also clustered adjacent to the rDNA repeats and within the mating-type (MAT) locus. The genome shows the evidence of alternative splicing (e.g. exon skipping, truncation, etc.) and antisense transcripts which have no coding potentiality. There is a single mating locus regulating the sexual growth phase spanning over 100 kb with more than 20 genes. It is quite larger than other MAT loci of different fungi. This locus can encode one of the two idiomorphic alleles which determines whether the cell will be MATa or MAT\u03b1. In general two types of genes in a MAT loci, one encoding pheromone and pheromone receptor and the other encoding homeodomain transcription factor, are required for sexual mating. Initially during mating of C. neoformans, compatibility of the pheromone and pheromone receptor genes is required for cellular fusion, followed by dikaryon formation which is dependent on compatible homeodomain transcription factors (Sxi1\u03b1/Sxi2a). Further, CLP1 gene products also have regulatory role in dikaryon formation which is Sxi-dependent.

However, human-to-human transmission is not recorded, and it seems that human/animals are the dead-end host from where the cells can be recycled in the nature. 4.12.12 Pathogenesis 4.12.12.1 C. neoformans var. neoformans The spores lodge in the lung alveoli of the animals or human after inhalation. Initially the infection is asymptomatic and dormant. The dormancy of the yeast cells is associated with several adaptive and immune evasion mechanisms. Calcineurin, produced by C. neoformans dephosphorylates a group of proteins that allow for their growth at physiological body temperature (37 C), elevated CO 2 and alkaline pH. It also induces metabolic and oxidative stress genes required for their survival within the host tissues. The capsule of the fungi helps in evasion of immune system and survival within the host. The capsule is constituted with mannan (polysaccharide) which is highly hydrophilic. It makes a gelatinous zone surrounding the yeasts that conceals the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) from the immune system. Further, the mannan component can induce the production of IL10 (anti-inflammatory) and reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes. It also reduces the surface expression of activation markers and thus downregulates the macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. The capsule also prevents antibody binding with the yeasts. Other capsular characteristics such as antiphagocytic property, shedding of L-selectin from the neutrophil surface associated with reduced adhesion and chemotaxis of neutrophils into the inflammatory site and altered phagocytosis (binding of capsular GXM with FcR\u03b3IIB of host cells produces IL10 which decreases the immune response) also help in immune evasion. However, persistence within the host for the longer period depends on survival of the yeasts within the macrophages and It helps the yeast to grow at body temperature (37 C) and alkaline pH.

During immunosuppression of the hosts, the spores reactivate and disseminate into the different organs such as the skin, eyes, myocardium, bones, joints, lungs, prostate gland, urinary tract and the central nervous system (CNS). The dissemination into the blood circulation can occur through the infected macrophages ('Trojan horse mechanism').

Occasionally the daughter cells exit by extrusion without lysis. Sometimes they are again engulfed by fresh macrophages to avoid the contact with the host defence. After development of fungaemia, through the blood circulation, they can reach the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and penetrate the barrier to enter the CNS and cause rapid multiplication and meningoencephalitis as a consequence.

They can induce the formation of microvilli-like protrusions by the reorganisation of the host cell cytoskeletal structures. These protrusions help the yeast cells to enter brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Sometimes the yeast cells utilise CD44 protein present in the lipid rafts of the host endothelial cells as receptor for invasion of BMECs (hyaluronic acid of the yeast acts as ligand). After close attachment with the host endothelial cells, the activation of host protein kinase C \u03b1-isoform occurs followed by cytoskeleton rearrangement that contributes to the intracellular transport. Within the cell cytoplasm, they are present in a membrane-bound vacuole, and they can exit from the cells with minimal damage. Thus, the endothelial cells are used as a vehicle by the yeasts to penetrate the barrier (transcytosis). Occasionally it is observed that occludin (tight junction maker protein) is degraded during the Cryptococcus and BMEC interaction which suggests the partial disruption of tight junction to allow the passage of the yeasts.

Further it can produce extracellular fibrils which can prevent the phagocytosis by the neutrophils and help to establish the initial pulmonary infection. Trehalose is detected as major antioxidant in C. gattii. The genes encoding for trehalose synthase (TPS1p and TPS2p) are required for thermotolerance, virulence and expression of the capsule and melanin in C. gattii.",

The professional phagocytes especially the bronchoalveolar macrophages engage in complement-mediated phagocytosis of the yeasts. The dendritic cells (DC), natural killer cells (NK) and neutrophils can also be lethal for the nonpathogenic Cryptococcus. The capsule can activate the alternative complement pathway and the binding of C3 with the yeasts. This C3-mediated binding is absent in CNS explaining another reason for their CNS affinity. Most pathogenic strains produce different virulence factors (Table 4 .28) which can evade the innante response. The innate response helps to develop the adaptive immune response. The protective anti-Cryptococcal immunity is T cell-mediated (CD4+ Th1 and Th17). After effective clearance of the infection, regulatory T cell (Treg) response develops for the suppression of the response through the production of tumour growth factor (TGF\u03b2) and IL10. However, pathogenic yeasts can also induce Treg response for their survival. The antibodies are also part of the immune response because the antibodies against the capsule component glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) can lyse the fungi in vitro.",

Detection of antigen: Detection of Cryptococcal antigen in the CSF (antigenaemia titre) can be performed by latex particles coated with polyclonal serum and ELISA. Both of the tests are specific and sensitive. The detection of antigen is possible from both the live and dead organisms. During initial phase of therapy, disintegration of the yeast cells releases the capsule which produces high titre (>1: 60,000). So, the tests should not be done within 6-8 weeks after initiation of the therapy. The titre can be observed even after successful treatment as the dead organisms also have the intact capsule. However, negative titre is inconclusive because the relapse of the infection may occur if the organism persists in the nasal cavity. So, nasal culture should be done as a supplementary test for confirmation. 5. Serological tests: The serological tests for detection of Cryptococcal antibodies in serum are not very useful because the healthy animals also produce antibody titre due to carriage or persistent infection. Latex particle coated with monoclonal rabbit anticapsular antigen and indirect fluorescence antibody test (FAT) can be used for the detection of serum antibody.

Amphotericin B (0.5 mcg/mL minimum inhibitory concentration) is the suitable antifungal for the animals especially with the CNS involvement. Other antifungals such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, albaconazole and fluconazole may be used. Itraconazole is more effective in the lung and bone involvement. Periodic assessment of liver enzymes is required with prolonged ketoconazole therapy in animals. Further, management of increased intracranial pressure is required especially during the first 3-4 weeks of the infection. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is recommended as the corticosteroids are not useful in Cryptococcal infection. For evaluation, fungal antigen detection should be performed just after completion of therapy and 1 month later to know whether there is any relapse.

Surgical intervention, cryotherapy and administration of amphotericin B and sodium iodide are recommended for treatment of Cryptococcal rhinitis.

Some species such as C. glabrata can express the yeast and pseudohyphae forms, but primarily a yeast form both in the environment and host tissue without any morphological switch. The morphological switch between the yeast and filamentous form is correlated with the virulence. Several external (environmental cues) and internal factors regulate the morphological switch of Candida. The environmental cues include presence of serum, temperature (37 C), low levels of oxygen, high levels of CO 2 and poor nutrition. Bacterial peptidoglycan present in serum, N-acetylglucosamine found in mucus of gastrointestinal tract, 5 % CO 2 as a product of host cellular respiration and poor nutrition can induce the filamentous growth through the activation of cAMP/PKA pathway (regulated by Candida Ras protein). The pH change response is mediated through Candida Rim101 pathway. The contact-dependent response and osmotic sensing are regulated by Mkc1 and Hog1 MAPK pathway, respectively. The internal factors include the filament-induced gene (HGC1) which encodes a cyclin-related protein required for septin phosphorylation and inhibition of cell separation. Several members of secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) gene family (SAP4, SAP5, SAP6) are also expressed during morphological switch required for invasion of host tissues. The transition from yeast to hyphal phase in Candida is regulated by the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathways which can also coordinately regulate the virulence gene expression associated with this transition. Three sensor histidine kinases (Sln1, Chk1, Nik1) also regulate the phase conversion and mutants are unable to produce hyphae.

In the laboratory, this switching is rare (1 in every 10 4 cell division) and it is regulated by host environmental factors. These morphological types are genetically stable, i.e. white or opaque cells always produce white or opaque type of progeny, respectively. The 'white' cells are relatively round and form smooth colonies on solid media, while 'opaque' cells are large and elongated and form flat and grey or opaque colonies. Certain phenotype-specific genes (WH11, EFG1) are expressed by white cells, while OP4 and SAP4 are expressed by opaque cells. White cells are more virulent and can easily colonise the host internal organs, whereas the opaque cells are associated with cutaneous infection probably due to expression of SAP4 gene. The stable opaque type and either a or \u03b1-mating-type cell can undergo efficient sexual mating. Master regulator of this complex switching system is WOR1 which can convert the white cells into opaque cells. This WOR1 expression produces a direct positive feedback loop by binding its own promoter and turning 'on' its own expression. The a/\u03b1-heterodimer cells (mating type) cannot switch from white to opaque because they directly repress the WOR1 promoter.

The adhesion is a complex process as both the cells (Candida and host cells) are negatively charged which will repeal each other.

Successful adherence depends on the interaction between these forces [extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory]. Overcoming the repulsive forces, C. albicans detects the host environment either by contact sensing due to body temperature, pH change or any other unexplored mechanism to express different invasins (Table 4 .31) on their surface for attachment with the host cells.",

Sometimes below the surface inoculation is preferred for better chlamydospore production in low-oxygen tension. The plates are incubated at 30 C for 2-4 days. A coverslip is placed over the surface, and the plate is observed under the high dry objective for the detection of thick-walled chlamydospores (8-12 \u03bcm) at the tips of pseudohyphae. 5. Histopathology: The presence of blastospores and pseudohyphae in the histochemically stained smear can be identified. A monoclonal antibody (3H8) is developed against C. albicans cell wall mannoprotein which can specifically recognise C. albicans in culture and in paraffin-embedded tissue sections using immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining. This antibody specifically detects the mycelial forms and to a lesser extent blastospores of C. albicans and does not react with any other Candida spp. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) using oligonucleotide probes directed against 18S rRNA has been used to differentiate C. albicans from C. parapsilosis in tissues. 6. Immunological assays: The ELISA-based tests are developed to detect the Candidal antigens such as secreted aspartyl proteinase, mannan and \u03b2-D glucan. Dissociation of antigen-antibody complexes is necessary for the optimal detection of mannan in the circulation. This antigen is heat stable and resists boiling, proteinase treatment and acidic pH. So antigen-antibody complexes are routinely dissociated by boiling with EDTA or by Unknown 4.13 Candida enzymatic treatment. The sensitivity and specificity of the mannan-based test is 58 and 93 %, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of \u03b2-D glucan (BDG) detection test is 77 and 85 %, respectively. These immunological assays are useful in diagnosis of Candida in immunocompromised patients who produce negligible or undetectable amount of antibodies. 7. Serological tests: The ELISA-based serological tests are developed for detection of antibodies against Candidal aminopeptidase, mannan and secreted aspartyl proteinase in the suspected serum. Indirect immunofluorescence assay is also developed for the detection of anti-Candidal antibody (IgG). However, serological tests for detection of Candida are not so much reliable. The false-positive reaction occurs due to superficial colonisation, and false-negative reaction occurs in immunocompromised patients producing low or undetectable level of antibodies. 8. Molecular biology: Several types of PCR such as semi-nested and nested PCR, multiplex PCR followed by DNA sequencing or pyrosequencing are developed for detection of Candidal DNA. The target DNA includes rRNA (5.8S, 18S, 28S) gene, internaltranscribed spacer (ITS) and intergenic spacer (IGS) region. However, liberation of DNA from the cell is challenging due to the presence of a highly rigid cell wall which often produces false-negative result. The falsepositive result is produced when highly conserved rRNA (5.8S, 18S, 28S) or other genes are targeted and airborne fungal contamination occurs. Confirmation of PCR amplicon by enzyme immune assay (EIA) using colorimetric substrate is considered as an easy and cheapest method. Real-time PCR method is also developed using Taqman probe or light cycler system for the identification of Candida. They also lack the post amplification detection costs; however, the initial cost for setup of the laboratory and instruments is high.",

In 1900, Hektoen and Perkins further reported sporotrichosis from cutaneous lesion of a patient in the Unites States. The dimorphism of Sporothrix was described by Howard in 1961. However, the erroneous classification of the fungi under the genus Sporotrichum continued until 1961.

Direct examination: The wet mounts with 10 % KOH are employed on the clinical specimen for detection of the yeast cells which is diagnostic of sporotrichosis. However, detection of yeasts depends on the fungal burden in the body. So detection is easier in cat specimens than human clinical samples due to high fungal burden in cats. Staining can be performed with Gram stain or Giemsa stain (for diluted pus sample). They are not so much confirmatory because 'cigar-shaped buds' are present only in 1-2 % cases. Instead, fluorescent staining offers confirmatory diagnosis of the yeasts. 2. Isolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. 3. Histopathology: The yeast cells of S. schenckii can be demonstrated in the tissues with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. The cells appear as spherical with PAS-positive capsule. The granuloma produced by the fungi consists of three zones. The central or chronic zone contains neutrophils, histiocyte and lymphocytes along with 'asteroid bodies'. Surrounding the central zone, there is a second zone which contains epithelioid cells and giant cells (strange body and Langerhans type). The third and outer zone is composed of lymphocytes, plasmocytes and fibroblasts. However, the zones are not a constant diagnostic feature and the cells can mingle with each other. In dogs, the granuloma is characterised by increased neutrophil infiltration and absence of lymphocytes and macrophages which can differentiate it with the leishmaniasis lesion.",

The Splendore-Hoeppli reaction is a localised immunological response in fungal, bacterial or parasitic infection, and it is characterised by the formation of radiating homogenous, refractile, eosinophilic club-like material surrounding a central eosinophilic focus (Fig. 4.32) . The asteroid bodies in Sporotrichosis consists the viable yeast cells in the Fig. 4 .32 Splendore-Hoeppli reaction in sporotrichosis. Arrow indicates the radiating club-like material surrounding a central eosinophilic focus (Photograph courtesy: Prof. P.P. Gupta, Ex-Director of Veterinary Research, Punjab Agricultural University, Punjab, India) centre along with the host IgG and IgM on the spikes of the radiated crown. Thus, the asteroid bodies use the host immune molecules to provide a safe shelter to the yeasts. 4. Serological tests: The serological tests such as agarose gel precipitation test (AGPT), tube agglutination (96 % sensitivity), latex agglutination (94 % sensitivity) and immunoelectrophoresis can be employed for detection of antibodies against S. schenckii. The AGPT does not cross-react with the sera from leishmaniasis. However, these tests are not so much sensitive for the diagnosis of cutaneous form of the infection. Enzymatic immune assay such as ELISA is a preferred choice of serodiagnosis. The test was initially developed against the S. schenckii conA-binding fraction (SsCBF) antigen. However, in serodiagnosis of cutaneous form, this antigenbased ELISA produces cross-reaction with other infection such as paracoccidioidomycosis. Later, the exoantigens produced by a mycelial phase of S. schenckii strain, isolated from Brazil, were used in ELISA which produced no cross-reaction with antigens and serum samples from patients with coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis or paracoccidioidomycosis. 5. Skin test for detection of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH): The 'sporotrichin test' is a tuberculin-like skin test for the detection of DTH against sporotrichosis. The antigen used for the test varies with the country and accordingly the result also varies. The 5 McFarland standard suspension of heat-killed yeast cells, extracted mycelial antigens at 1:2,000 dilution (approximately 5 \u00c2 10 7 cells/mL) or diluted yeast phase antigens at 1:4,000 were used as antigen in Brazil and Mexico, respectively. The antigen is inoculated at 0.1 mL into the forearm or back of the suspected patient. A positive result involves an indurated, erythematous and painful area of more than 5 mm in diameter at the site of the injection 48 h after inoculation. The test is sensitive for detection of lymphocutaneous and fixed cutaneous forms. Rarely, the false-negative reaction is produced in anergic or immunosuppressed patients and false-positive reaction is produced in healthy patients previously suffered from the infection. Experimentally the sporotrichin test with SsCBF antigen in guinea pig was found reactive. In Brazil, the sporotrichin test was carried out among the captive mammals present in a zoo for epidemiological investigation. 6. Molecular biology: The chitin synthase gene (ChS1)-based PCR was first developed which can detect up to 10 picogram of genomic S. schenckii DNA. Further PCR-based assays are also developed, detecting DNA topoisomerase II and internal transcriber space in the rRNA gene of S. schenckii.",

KI has immunostimulation property which can activate the neutrophils and monocytes to destroy the fungi. Some authors claim its proteolytic nature which helps to resolve the granulomas. However, exact mechanism of action is not known. The KI therapy should be continued for 2-3 months for complete cure. However, in human, some side effects such as nausea, vomition, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and metallic taste are noted. Some cats are also susceptible to iodide toxicosis. In human, itraconazole is the first choice treatment with the dose rate of 100-200 mg/day orally (for lymphocutaneous and fixed forms). It has minimal toxicity and good tolerance even in long-term treatment except during pregnancy. In cats and dogs, also itraconazole is preferred nowadays. For disseminated form of sporotrichosis, amphotericin B is preferred even in pregnant women (after 12 weeks of pregnancy) and immunosuppressed patients. Fluconazole is less effective and is preferred only for those patients who are allergic to itraconazole. The ketoconazole is not used due to poor efficacy and high level of toxicity. The terbinafine and posaconazole showed good in vitro activity against S. schenckii. The thermotherapy is recommended for fixed cutaneous form in pregnant or drug-allergic patients because S. schenckii cannot grow at more than 40 C. The hot baths (45 C) for 15-20 min three times a day and topical thermal compression are advised ( Fig. 4.33 ).",

In the seventeenth century, a German physician (Engelbert Kaempfer) working in India first reported clinical human cases of mycetoma which is followed by case reports of French missionaries in Pondicherri, India (eighteenth century). In 1842, John Gill, a British Army physician working at South India, also reported a case of human mycetoma. Godfrey (1846) first described an authentic clinical report of four human mycetoma cases from Madras (Chennai), India, and named them as 'morbus tuberculosis pedis'. Due to its widespread occurrence among barefooted natives in Madurai (India), it was popularly known as 'Madura foot'. In 1860, Carter established the term 'mycetoma' and its etiological correlation with the fungi. In 1874, Carter wrote a monograph entitled 'On mycetoma or the fungus disease of India' where he established firmly the correlation between the fungus and the menace. Laveran (1902) first isolated Streptothrix mycetomi as the fungal agent from the mycetoma (black grain). Brumpt (1905) reclassified Streptothrix mycetomatis as Madurella mycetomi. British Medical Research Council (1977) further changed the name from Madurella mycetomi to Madurella mycetomatis which is accepted worldwide. Radaeli (1911) first isolated a fungus (Monosporium apiospermum) from the whitegrain mycetoma in Sardinia. Currently this fungus is known as Pseudallescheria boydii (teleomorph).",

Direct examination of the wet mount slides prepared from the clinical specimen or culture and stained with lactophenol cotton blue or calcofluor white can be done (Fig. 4.43) . The tissues can be stained with Gridley fungus stain, Grocott's modification of Gomori methenamine silver, PAS with or without diastase and haematoxylin-eosin (less sensitive). Prototheca appears as large, spherical, oval or elliptical, non-budding cells both in wet mount and tissues. The size of Prototheca sporangia is usually smaller (10-30 \u03bcm) than the other fungi, and it contains 2-20 numbers of sporangiospores. In Gramstained smears, spores stain as gram positive and the empty sporangia are gram negative. The PAS staining with diastase can differentiate Prototheca and green algae. The green algae contain cytoplasmic starch granules that are PAS negative following diastase treatment. Serological tests for the detection of anti-Prototheca antibodies can be performed in cattle to confirm the subclinical infection. The PCR based on 18S rDNA sequence is developed for differentiation of three P. zopfii genotypes. Taqman probe-based quantitative PCR is recently developed for the differentiation of P. zopfii genotype which is based on small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences.",

The first human case was described by Jorge Lobo (1931) in Brazil. Lobo designated the infection as 'keloidal blastomycosis' due to the presence of organisms resembling Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Later the disease was named Jorge Lobo's disease. It is caused by Lacazia loboi, a yeast-like organism which is noncultivable in artificial culture medium. Lacazia loboi is taxonomically related (sister taxon) with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and belongs to the order Onygenales. Both of the fungi share antigenic proteins (gp43, chitin synthase). The sequencing of L. loboi gp43 revealed its higher degree of nucleotide similarity (85 %) with P. brasiliensis gp43 and comparatively lower similarity (75 %) in amino acid level. Probably the high degree of nucleotide similarity occurs due to lack of known sexual reproduction and contact with its natural habitat for prolonged period (40-50 years) which helps to retain the original nucleotide motif in L. loboi genome. Further genomic study revealed about the loss of certain nucleotides (reductive evolution) which was earlier observed in other uncultivated, host-restricted pathogens such as Mycobacterium leprae, Rickettsia prowazekii and Buchnera. The reductive evolution occurs due to lack of known sexual cycle to acquire new DNA during recombination, and as a consequence decreased evolutionary fitness with every possibility of early extinction takes place.",

The conidiophores come up at right angle from the vegetative hyphae and produce small aleurioconidia (2-4 \u03bcm). These spores are transmitted into the host by inhalation. In the lung tissue (or in artificial culture at 40 C), the spores are converted into a spherical structure (adiaconidia). The adiaconidium matures into a thick-walled spherule (200-400 \u03bcm in diameter). No further replication of spherule is observed. The spherule wall is refractile and bilayered. The outer layer is narrow and eosinophilic, whereas the inner layer is wide, hyaline and chiefly made of chitin.

The forms are solitary granuloma, localised granulomatous form and disseminated form. In low concentration of spores, pulmonary nodules develop and the infection remains asymptomatic. In disseminated form, fever, cough and dyspnoea are observed due to compression and displacement of alveolar parenchyma by the expanding granulomas. Rarely the infection may spread into the other body parts such as the skin, peritoneum and bone. In animals, the infection is mostly asymptomatic and light grey to yellowish lesions are observed in the lungs.",

In the tissues, the spherule is detected in the centre of a granuloma produced by giant cells, epithelioid cells and fibrous tissues. All the granulomas are in the same developmental stages, indicating that no replication of spherule occurs. The distinguishing thick wall and absence of sporangiospores help in differential diagnosis of Emmonsia spherules from others such as the spherules of Coccidioides immitis or Rhinosporidium seeberi. The fungi are difficult to isolate. Common fungal media such as Sabouraud dextrose agar without antibiotic are used (30 C). The serological tests are not reliable for diagnosis. PCR and sequencing is developed for the confirmation of Emmonsia crescens from clinical specimens.",

The lesions are circular, painless, thick, white and scattered. The lesions appear in the head, neck, paw and less frequently in the back, flank and limbs. The secondary bacterial infection may occur associated with pruritis. Other clinical signs are skin scaling and loss of hair M. gypseum Horses Equine dermatophytosis: The dry, scaly and multiple lesions appear in any part of the body especially in the groomed part. Sometimes the lesions become larger to produce a 'moth-eaten appearance' M. gallinae Poultry Favus (white comb): Birds of all age groups kept under poor management are susceptible. White patches are noticed in the comb of male birds. The lesions may coalesce and the whole comb is covered with thick white coating. The infection may progress into the feather, gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract. Necrotic foci with yellowish mass are observed in trachea. Emaciation followed by death may occur M. nanum, M. canis, M. gypseum Pigs Large breeds (Yorkshire) and all age groups are equally susceptible. Unhygienic condition, high humidity, high stocking density favours the transmission. The lesions are small, circular, mildly inflamed and are located throughout the body. The skin becomes reddish with formation of crusts. No alopecia is observed. with desquamation, erythema in the margin and central healing. Lesions are single or multiple, mostly confined in the head. Occasionally lesions are found in legs and tails. Intensity of pruritis is variable and usually no fever or anorexia is observed. 'Miliary dermatophytosis' affects dorsal trunk. In immunosuppressed patients, larger area of alopecia, erythema, pruritis and crusts develops. Rarely nodular granulomatous dermatitis (pseudomycetoma) develops. Feline otitis is also produced which is characterised by waxy, ceruminous discharges from the ear canal M. canis, M. gypseum Dogs The lesions are circular (2.5 cm in diameter) and are located in face, elbows, paws. The skin becomes dry and scaly M. audouinii, M. canis Human Tinea capitis: It is dermatophyte infection of the scalp and hair shaft, commonly occurs in children. The transmission occurs due to close contact with infected pets. The infection causes mild erythema, patchy area of scaling, grey hair stumps. Sometimes the infection causes huge inflammation, folliculitis and kerion (boggy, sterile, inflammatory scalp mass) formation, areas of scaring and alopecia. The swollen hairs fracture a few millimetres from the scalp and produce 'black dot' alopecia.

The family contains another important genus known as Penicillium. Currently, the Trichocomaceae family is proposed to be further divided into three subfamilies such as Aspergillaceae, Trichocomaceae and Thermoascaceae. The genus Aspergillus contains more than 250 species grouped into subgenera and species complex. There are eight such subgenera, i.e. Aspergillus, Fumigati, Circumdati, Candidi, Terrei, Nidulantes, Warcupi and Ornati. The important species complexes are A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. niger, A. nidulans and A. ustus. Molecular studies revealed several cryptic species (hidden species that are morphologically indistinguishable) within the Aspergillus species complex. For example, Neosartorya peudofischeri, Aspergillus lentulus, A. viridinutans and A. fumigatiafinnis are cryptic species described under A. fumigatus species complex.",

Other histological stains, such as periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), haematoxylin-eosin, Giemsa, papanicolaou and mucicarmine, can also be used as a substitute. 4. Detection of antigen: Detection of antigen is useful in the very early stage of coccidioidomycosis when antibody is not developed (within 1 week) and in the patients suffering from hypogammaglobulinaemia or other immunodeficiency who are unable to produce the antibody. The tests such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) and inhibition ELISA were developed to detect the protein-carbohydrate conjugate antigen of the fungi. 5. Serological tests: The serological tests are not only diagnostic but also indicative about the prognosis of the infection. Detection of anti-Coccidioides IgM (within 1-3 weeks of infection) can be done by tube precipitin (TP) and immunodiffusion (ID) tests. The TP is based on heat-stable 120 kDa \u03b2 glucosidase antigen, whereas detection of IgG (after third week-several months) can be done by complement fixation test (CFT) which is based on heat-labile chitinase antigen. However, canine serum contains anticomplementary substances; so CFT cannot be performed in the dogs. Serological IgG titre can indicate about the severity of the infection in human. For example, increasing IgG titre such as 1:32 or more indicates about the disseminated infection in human, whereas IgG titre between 1:2 and 1:16 is considered as positive for infected dogs.",

Further, a real-time PCR is developed with primers amplifying a 170 base-pair part in the ITS2 (internal-transcribed spacer 2) region of the rDNA genome.

In 1934, William DeMonbreun established the association of histoplasmosis with fungus. He first isolated the organism in artificial media, showed its dimorphism and experimentally produced the infection in laboratory animals to meet the conditions of Koch's postulate(De Monbreun 1934).

Nodular lesions appear in the skin, subcutaneous tissues and lymphatics. In other forms of the disease, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and multifocal pneumonia are also observed. The disease is endemic in tropical countries such as North, East and Northeast Africa and some parts of Asia such as India, Pakistan and Japan. It occurs sporadically in other parts of the world such as France, Russia, Egypt and Italy H. capsulatum var. capsulatum Human Two clinical forms, i.e. self-limiting mild respiratory tract infection and disseminated forms, are noted. The later form is found life-threatening in elder or immunocompromised patients such as AIDS patients or recipients of organ transplants. The fungus is endemic worldwide, but there are regions with high incidences of infection, such as areas along the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys in the United States and in Rio de Janeiro State in South eastern Brazil Dog Three clinical forms, i.e. pulmonary, disseminated and clinically inapparent form, are found. Appearance of clinical signs depends on organ involvement. In general the signs include coughing, dyspnoea, anorexia, ascites and ulceration of oral and nasal mucosa, fever and diarrhoea Cat Respiratory disease, fluctuating fever, weight loss, lethargy H. capsulatum var. duboisii Human African histoplasmosis: This form is prevalent in western and central Africa and in the island of Madagascar. The disease involves the skin, subcutaneous tissue, lymph node, bone and rarely the lung or other organs after appearance of the clinical signs. The infected animals produce a delayed hypersensitivity reaction after inoculation of mycelial extract (histofarcin). For detection of H. capsulatum var. farciminosum, the exudate or biopsy samples can be collected from unruptured nodules with the help of fine needle. The material should be kept in sterile peptone water with antibiotics and transported to the laboratory in a flask with ice and proper label. The swabs of the material should be prepared for direct examination. For histopathology, sections of lesion material should be placed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin. For detection of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum, urine, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (pneumonia patients), cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis patients) and bone marrow aspirates can be collected from human patients. Pulmonary aspirate, gastric washings, peripheral blood (febrile condition), faeces, sternal bone marrow, biopsied liver, spleen or lymph node can be collected from dogs. 4.7.13.2 Laboratory Examination 1. Direct examination: The wet mount or gramstained smear is prepared with the swab sample and observed under microscope for detection of typical H. capsulatum var. farciminosum yeast cells, which will appear as gram positive, pleomorphic or pear shaped, double contoured, approximately 2-5 \u03bcm in diameter. They are intracellular within macrophages or neutrophils or occasionally they are extracellular. Budding may be visible from the pointed end of the yeast cells. The electron microscopy can be applied for detection of H. capsulatum var. farciminosum with minute cellular details in the skin biopsy samples. Direct examination provides best result for detection of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum in pulmonary histoplasmosis patients. In South America, Tzanck cytodiagnosis technique provides a useful and rapid diagnosis method for AIDS-associated histoplasmosis, due to the high frequency of mucocutaneous lesions in these patients. 2. Isolation and identification: Isolation of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum from bone marrow aspirates and blood samples suffering from disseminated histoplasmosis is an important diagnostic tool. In blood culture, the lysis-centrifugation technique should be employed, since it is sevenfolds more sensitive than the conventional techniques used for clinical sample preparation. Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. 3. Animal inoculation test: Laboratory animals such as mice, guinea pig and rabbits are used for experimental inoculation of H. capsulatum var. farciminosum. Impression smear of the liver and spleen from the inoculated animals should show the yeast cells 2-4 weeks post inoculation in positive cases. 4. Detection of antigen: ELISA and fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) are successfully used for the detection of H/M antigen of H. capsulatum var. farciminosum from cultured mycelium.

            "text": "38 Clinical features of mycetoma in human and animals Species Clinical features HumanThe incubation period is unknown. Mean duration of eumycetoma is 9.8 years. The infection starts with a small, firm, painless tumour-like mass in subcutaneous tissue which further spreads into the subcutaneous fat, muscle, ligaments and bones. With the progress, multiple nodules develop, ulcerate and drain through the sinuses. The sinus tracts appear within 3 months-1 year. The discharge is purulent or serosanguinous and it contains the grains. The draining sinuses may heal and a new one opens simultaneously. The lesion is painless due to nerve damage by fibrous tissue reaction. Intense pain is felt only when there is bone involvement and secondary bacterial infection. Most of the mycetoma cases (70 %) occur in the feet. It may occur at other sites such as the hand, knee, arm, leg, head, neck and face, thigh, perineum and rarely at chest and abdominal wall, eyelid, testis, vulva, middle ear, paranasal sinus, mandible and lymph nodes Horses Mycetoma in horses is characterised by the subcutaneous nodules which may suppurate and drain a serosanguineous or purulent discharge through multiple sinus tracts. The discharges contain the fungal grains Cats Subcutaneous nodules are detected in dorsal trunk which drains purulent exudate containing yellow-coloured granules DogsNodules are observed in subcutaneous tissues and sometimes in the ribs and thorax with visible granules. Rarely disseminated mycetoma is found which involves the lymph nodes, heart, kidneys, adrenal glands, bone, pancreas, brain and eyes GoatsMycetomal lesions are observed in hind legs and scapula CattleLesions are found in the skin, nasal cavity and lymph node Grand Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus roratus)Black nodules were detected in thoracic cavity and lung causing central nervous system disorder and wing paralysis4.15.13 ImmunityMacrophages are the first line of defence against Scedosporium apiospermum which are able to phagocytose both the hyphae and conidia. The hyphae are opsonised with the serum, and the macrophages can produce oxidative burst/ superoxide anion (O 2 \u00c0 ) to control the opsonised hyphae. The polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) can also participate in phagocytosis and oxidative burst-mediated killing of Scedosporium. However, the cytokine (IL15) can enhance this oxidative burst of PMNs against Scedosporium prolificans but not against Scedosporium apiospermum.The cell wall \u03b1-glucan of P. boydii is recognised by toll-like receptor (TLR2) and CD14 of host macrophages and dendritic cells. The interaction can transduce the signal to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines.4.15.14 Diagnosis 4.15.14.1 Clinical Specimens The diagnosis of mycetoma depends on three major clinical symptoms (triad of clinical symptoms) such as edematous subcutaneous tissue, multiple draining sinuses and excreation of grains. The clinical specimens include pus, exudate, bandage gauze and biopsy tissues which are used for naked eye examination to detect the grains. The physical properties of the grains are indicative of the etiological agent(Table 4.36).Fine needle technique is also used for the collocation of grains from the lesions. A fine needle attached to a syringe is inserted within the lesion, and it is moved up and down in 3-4 different locations to collect the exudates. The bloody material is kept for some time to clot. 4.15.14.2 Laboratory Examination 1. Direct examination: For the detection of etiological agent (fungi or bacteria), the grains are crushed and fixed with 10 % formal saline on a microscopic slide. The slide can be stained with modified acid-fast staining to detect the bacterial etiological agent, if any. For the detection of fungal aetiology, the slides are immersed in 20 % KOH followed by fluorescence microscopy using the Uvitec, Blankophor or calcofluor white. However, the fluorescence microscopy cannot differentiate between the fungal genera. 2. Isolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. 3. Histopathology: The grains can be identified in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections. Gram-Weigert stain can be used to detect bacterial mycetoma and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Gomori methenamine silver, and Gridley stains are used to detect hyphae and fungal spores in eumycetoma.The grains have differentiating characteristics in the tissue section which creates an idea regarding the aetiology. For example, the black grains of Trematosphaeria grisea (M. grisea) have a non-pigmented centre and dark-coloured periphery with brown cementing substances. Further, the tissue reaction is also suggestive for the fungal aetiology. The grains are surrounded by neutrophils in M. mycetomatis infections and by eosinophils in P. boydii infections. However, most of the fungi-causing eumycetoma cannot be differentiated by histopathology. For example, the fungal species such as Scedosporium, Aspergillus and Fusarium produce hyaline hyphae with septation at regular intervals and dichotomous branching. Sometimes Scedosporium produce terminal or intercalary chlamydospores which are confused with the yeasts. 4. Serological tests: Indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA) and immunodiffusion test (ID) are developed for the detection of Pseudallescheria boydii. For the detection of M. mycetomatis antibodies in human, immunodiffusion and counter immune electrophoresis (CIE) are widely used. Sometimes, ID tests produce false-negative reaction especially during the early phase of the infection and when the treatment is ongoing. The CIE is found to be superior than ID for better sensitivity. ELISA is also used for the detection of antibodies. Previously the ultrasonicated mycelial extract (cytoplasmic protein) was used as antigen in serological tests which produce variable results and cross-reaction with other fungi. The use of recombinant antigens [fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) and pyruvate kinase (PK)] in ELISA produces promising result for detection of M. mycetomatis antibodies. 5. Molecular biology: The PCR is developed for the detection of M. mycetomatis and Pseudallescheria boydii using the primer for internal-transcribed spacer (ITS) located between 18S and 28S genes and beta-tubulin (BT2) genes, respectively. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique is used to detect P. boydii which is based on the amplification of the ITS region with pan-fungal primers. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is also developed for the confirmation of P. boydii which do not require sophisticated instruments and is suitable for endemic zones of developing countries.",

            "text": ", a veterinarian working in India, first described a chronic cutaneous granulomatous disease in horses known as 'bursattee' in local language. Later the aetiology of the disease was correlated with the fungi based on histology. In 1901, Dutch investigators (de Haan and Hoogkamer) working in Indonesia isolated the fungi and identified them as Zygomycetes (due to lack of sporulation) from the horses having similar kind of infection (Hyphomycosis destruens equi). Witkamp (1924), another Dutch scientist, also isolated the fungi from the horses showing a similar kind of syndrome. In 1974, Austwick and Copland recognised them as a member of the genus Pythium under oomycete family. Based on this finding, Chandler et al. (1980) proposed the term pythiosis for the infection. In 1987, de Cock first identified them as a new species under the genus Pythium and proposed the nomenclature of Pythium insidiosum.",

The samples are washed thrice with the sterile saline solution before culture and are cut into 5-10 mm blocks. The tissue blocks are impregnated directly into the agar plates. 3. Histopathology: The histological sections are stained with H&E, Gomori methenamine sliver (GMS) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). However, the hyphae are clearly visible only with GMS stain. Affected tissues contain multiple foci of necrosis surrounded by neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages. plasma cells, multinucleate giant cells and fewer neutrophils and eosinophils.

Serological tests: In the laboratory, different serological tests such as immunodiffusion, ELISA, immunochromatographic assay and Western blot are developed for the detection of anti-P. insidiosum antibodies. Immunodiffusion test is however unable to detect the antibodies in dogs, whereas ELISA shows potential in early detection of postoperative recurrence.

New eosinophils replace the older ones which accumulate in the tissues as a necrotic mass. The clinical signs associated with cutaneous form are itching, biting of the wound area and auto-mutilation, lameness, enlargement of regional lymph nodes, anaemia and hypoproteinaemia. The cutaneous form is known as 'swamp cancer' or 'Florida horse leeches'. In intestinal form (rare), stenotic fibrous and GI tract lesions are observed DogsIntestinal form is more frequent than the cutaneous form. The symptoms are vomition, weight loss and intermittent diarrhoea. There is segmental transmural thickening of the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, oesophagus or pharynx. Enlargement of mesenteric lymph node is observed which becomes palpable in the mid-abdomen. In cutaneous form, the lesions are found in the face, leg, ventrum, perineum and tail Cattle Pythiosis in cattle is a sporadic infection which is common in subtropical area during rainy season. Granulomatous lesions are observed in the limbs. The animals cannot stand and in untreated cases death may occur due to dehydration.
