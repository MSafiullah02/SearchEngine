Influenza infections cause complications including primary and secondary viral pneumonia [1, 2] and prolonged periods of viral shedding [3]. Since the last influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, an increased knowledge of influenza infection has confirmed the severity of the infection in this population. Different studies in SOT recipients have reported a rate of mortality associated with influenza infection ranging from 4% to 8%, with severe cases or complications in 12\u201320% of cases [1, 4].",

However, the response to influenza vaccination in the transplant setting is discordant, with lower efficacy than in the general population with a seroprotection rate that varies between 15% and 90% [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Suboptimal vaccination response may be partly a result of the incomplete protection against influenza reported for vaccination in high\u2010risk individuals [17]. Older individuals appear to be at particular risk for vaccine failure, perhaps as a result of immune senescence [18].",

In a multicentre study mentioned previously, we demonstrated a rate of clinical failure after receiving one dose of the pandemic vaccine of 1.1% [20]. However, there are no clinical studies that evaluate the impact of the antecedent of influenza vaccination in the SOT recipients with influenza disease.

Hence, more than half of patients with influenza illness had received 2010\u20132011 influenza vaccination, and most of them required hospital admission, with a severe disease occurring in 12% of them. However, influenza vaccination was associated with a lower incidence of pneumonia and shorter length of hospital stay.",

This is especially relevant, as influenza infection must not be ruled out in influenza\u2010vaccinated SOT recipients with respiratory symptoms or pneumonia in pandemic or epidemic periods. A high index of suspicion and an early diagnosis is mandatory, given the fact that, as previously reported, we found that time from onset of symptoms to initiating oseltamivir therapy was associated with the severity of the illness. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies characterizing the immunological response to influenza vaccine in SOT recipients. Although some of these studies have shown similar responses in renal [16] and liver [9] transplant recipients compared with that of the general population, most of them showed a reduced humoral immune response in renal [7, 10, 14, 15], liver [8, 25, 26], lung [27] and cardiac [6, 8] transplant recipients, with a seroprotection rate that varies between 15% and 90% [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and a lower seroprotection rate after vaccination of 78% compared with healthy subjects [7].",

Attenuation of disease severity has been described for other vaccines such as the 23\u2010valent polysaccharide vaccine against S. pneumoniae that was tested in the elderly, where vaccination was associated with a reduction of risk of death due to pneumonia complications [28, 29]. Limited data of a similar effect are available for non\u2010replicating influenza vaccines [30, 31], but no studies have been performed in transplant recipients. Reduction in illness severity, even among those who are not protected against infection, would enhance the population health benefits of this vaccine.",

First, the number of patients included in the study may be underpowered to demonstrate the association of the mortality rate and previous vaccination. In addition, although all patients were advised to seek care at the hospital if they had respiratory tract infection symptoms, it is possible that some patients with mild influenza infection did not attend the hospital. However, all severe cases of influenza were included in the study. As the objective of the study was not to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the vaccine, but to determine vaccination frequency among clinical cases of influenza, the loss of some mild cases does not invalidate our results, which show that vaccination failed in half of SOT recipients with severe influenza. Finally, given the association of severity and seroconversion, the episode of respiratory illness could be caused by other microorganisms and the detection of influenza virus might be related to an asymptomatic colonization. However, although investigated, no other viral co\u2010infections were detected in these patients and the positive predictive value of respiratory symptoms during the influenza epidemic period is very high [32]. We therefore think that these episodes corresponded to true influenza infections.",
