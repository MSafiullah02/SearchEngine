To do so we first need to understand species' responses to local-level habitat attributes in order to inform the decision-making process and on-ground conservation actions. Patterns in the occurrence of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species in 59 sites located in remnant urban habitat fragments of Brisbane City were assessed against local-level environmental characteristics of each site. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling ordination, and principal axis correlation were used to investigate relationships between species' occurrences and environmental characteristics. Native reptiles were most strongly associated with the presence of termite mounds, a high amount of fallen woody material, and a moderate amount of weed cover. Native small mammals were most strongly associated with the presence of grass trees (Xanthorrhoea spp.), and both reptiles and small mammals were negatively influenced by increased soil compaction. Significant floristic characteristics were considered to be important as structural, rather than compositional, habitat elements. Therefore, habitat structure, rather than vegetation composition, appears to be most important for determining native, terrestrial reptile and small mammal species assemblages in urban forest fragments. We discuss the management implications in relation to human disturbances and local-level management of urban remnants.",

Agricultural land use has previously been regarded as the primary cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, yet as areas of suitable arable land are exhausted, agricultural expansion is declining (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) . Comparatively, urban development is expanding rapidly, encroaching on agricultural and natural, non-arable, landscapes (Levia & Page 2000; Lugo 2002) . It therefore seems likely that urban development will surpass agricultural land use as the primary anthropogenic driver of land use change and habitat loss and fragmentation.",

These habitat modifications potentially have important consequences for concomitant fauna assemblages, with significant differences being apparent between urban and preurban assemblages (Jones & Wieneke 2000; van der Ree 2004; Tait et al. 2005) . Within the urban matrix, introduced species and a handful of native generalist species tend to dominate, while habitat and dietary specialists and migratory species tend to decline in numbers or become locally extinct (How & Dell 1993 , 2000 White & Burgin 2004; Tait et al. 2005 ).",

For native fauna assemblages, native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species are considered to be the fauna groups most sensitive to urbanization and its associated disturbances (How & Dell 1993 , 2000 van der Ree 2004; White & Burgin 2004; Tait et al. 2005) . Although many native mammals and reptiles are negatively influenced by urban development, some native mammal and reptile species, such as the common brush-tail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), blue-tongue lizard (Tiliqua scincoides), and fence skink (Cryptoblepharus virgatus) may adapt, and even thrive, within the built environment (Koenig et al. 2002; Matthews et al. 2004; Garden et al. 2006) . In contrast, urban-sensitive species (e.g. dunnarts, Sminthopsis spp., antechinus, Antechinus spp., geckos, and large reptiles) face significant dispersal, predator avoidance and, resource adaptation challenges within the human-dominated urban matrix. Consequently, these urban-sensitive species are restricted to the often isolated, remnant native vegetation patches that occur within the urban matrix or in the fringing peri-urban landscapes (How & Dell 1993 Tait et al. 2005; Garden et al. 2006) .",

Much of the current available scientific knowledge is based on non-urban ecological research (Garden et al. 2006) . In non-urban environments there is a strong global consensus that, regardless of the disturbance pressure, many native reptile and small mammal species depend more on structurally complex habitats, than compositionally diverse floristics (e.g. Bennett 1993; Southgate et al. 1996; Flemming & Loveridge 2003; Lenders & Daamen 2004; Spencer et al. 2005; Kanowski et al. 2006) . Similar findings have also been reported for native species within Australian urban landscapes (e.g. Dufty 1994; Jellinek et al. 2004; White & Burgin 2004) . Although, Fischer et al. (2003) and Jellinek et al. (2004) found that vegetation composition, in addition to structure, was important for reptile species in grazed and urban affected habitats. In contrast, Wilson et al. (1986) reported that within coastal heathlands of Victoria, several native rodent and dasyurid species displayed no floristic or vegetation structural preferences.",

This limitation is further compounded by differences in the type, rate and intensity of disturbances within urban landscapes compared with non-urban landscapes. A further complication is the large variation in habitat requirements among species (e.g. Jellinek et al. 2004; Monamy & Fox 2005 ), but also within species according to age. For example, although Fischer et al. (2003) found that four-fingered skinks (Carlia tetradactyla) responded to habitat structure and composition in grazing-affected landscapes, they also found that the relative importance of different attributes varied between juveniles and adults. Consequently, Australian urban conservation managers face significant uncertainty regarding the most appropriate management strategies for achieving long-term conservation outcomes for a diversity of native fauna species.",

This requires understanding how both species' composition and species' richness are influenced by local-level habitat factors. However, local-level habitat management is often focused on maintaining overall species' diversity within the landscape by managing habitat patches so that current concomitant assemblages of native fauna are conserved before they become locally extinct, thereby avoiding the need for expensive reintroduction programs. Conserving native fauna in urban landscapes first requires understanding what local or in situ factors are important for maintaining diverse assemblages of native fauna. This knowledge may then by used to inform urban conservation managers and planners about priority habitat management decisions and activities so that native fauna occupying urban habitat fragments are adequately conserved. This was the focus of our study. This paper investigated correlations between the composition of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal fauna within urban habitat fragments and local-level (<1 ha) habitat factors such as habitat structure, vegetation composition, fire and human disturbances. These habitat factors were considered ecologically important for the target species and also can be manipulated and managed by conservation managers. Investigations were based in urban habitat fragments located within the Brisbane City Council (BCC) local government area, where local government is responsible for setting within-patch management priorities and actions.We applied cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling and principal axis correlation to identify significant habitat attributes and examine their importance for reptile and small mammal assemblages. Mammal and reptile assemblages were analysed separately. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications for conservation management within Brisbane City.",

Brisbane has a subtropical climate and is Australia's third largest and most rapidly growing capital city (Commonwealth of Australia 2003). As European settlement in the early 1800s approximately two-thirds of the original woody vegetation has been cleared for agricultural, industrial and/or urban development purposes (Brisbane City Council 2001) . More than 80% of this clearing was of lowland forests (<100 m from sea level) resulting in the current, highly fragmented and isolated lowland remnant vegetation patches that vary in their internal condition and disturbance and management histories (Catterall & Kingston 1993; Brisbane City Council 2001) . Of the remaining 33% remnant vegetation cover, about 20% is protected for conservation purposes, yet much of this area is concentrated in contiguous forest on the city's outskirts, particularly in the D'Aguilar ranges to the west (Brisbane City Council 2001).",

Despite recent rapid urban expansion and subsequent habitat destruction and modification, Brisbane still supports high floristic and faunal diversity and endemism, boasting the highest diversity of native vertebrate species of any of Australia's capital cities (Queensland Museum 1995) .

Initial surveys (2004 were conducted at all 59 sites, yet repeat surveys (2005) occurred at only 51 sites, as nine sites were abandoned owing to recent fire or substantial human interference. Native reptile and small mammal species were identified at each site using a combination of live-trapping, direct observation and trace survey methods, to maximize the probability of detecting the range of target species. Each site was surveyed using: eight cage traps, 10 Elliott traps (two sizes: 80 \u00a5 85 \u00a5 220 mm; 80 \u00a5 100 \u00a5 320 mm), five dry pitfall traps (10 L buckets) and three hair funnels. Opportunistic species identifications from scats, visual observations and vocalizations were also recorded. Cage traps, Elliott traps and hair funnels were baited with the standard Australian native small mammal bait mixture (Menkhorst & Knight 2001) . Pitfall traps were unbaited. The dense vegetation and fallen woody debris at several sites prevented the use of drift-fences, which have previously been used with pitfall traps to improve capture success (e.g. Mengak & Guynn 1987; Crosswhite et al. 1999; Menkhorst & Knight 2001) . Cage and Elliott traps were set and baited each afternoon, checked for captures each morning and closed during the day. Pitfall traps remained open for the entire trap cycle (3 days and nights) and were checked for captures each morning and afternoon. Hair funnels were set at the beginning of a trap cycle and left undisturbed until collection at the end of the trap cycle. Scat collection, direct observations and vocalization records occurred opportunistically throughout each site visit. At the point of capture, animals were identified to species-level using a relevant field guide (Menkhorst & Knight 2001; Wilson 2005) , photographed, weighed, sexed (if possible) and immediately released. Scat and hair samples were identified ex situ by one of two independent experts (initial surveys analysed by Michiala Bowen; repeat survey samples analysed by Barbara Triggs 1996) .",

This involved a 1 m 2 screen, divided into 10 cm 2 grid cells, viewed at waist height from a 2-m distance. Three understorey measurements were recorded: (i) the total number of grid cells obscured by vegetation; (ii) the highest grid row obscured by vegetation (0 cm-100 cm); and (iii) the highest grid row with at least one grid cell \u054650% obscured by vegetation. These six stratum records were later averaged to provide measures of average per cent cover for each stratum and average understorey density at each site.

Per cent and types of ground cover were assessed visually. A 40-cm ruler was used to record ground cover depth. Soil compaction was measured using a penetrometer (e.g. Fox et al. 1996) and counting the number of hits taken (up to 20 hits) to drive a weighted probe 20 mm into the soil. For both ground cover depth and soil compaction, six measurements were made every 5 m.

Similarities between sites in terms of species' composition were first investigated using the Bray & Curtis index (Bray & Curtis 1957) . Clusters were derived from the data set using the flexible unweighted pair group using arithmetic averaging method (upgma) with a beta (b) value of -0.1. The upgma clustering method is considered superior as it considers more than one species at any fusion (Wardell-Johnson & Williams 1996; Podani & Schmera 2006) . At a beta value of -0.1, the upgma clustering method is space-dilating (cf. spacecontracting), thereby creating even-sized groups and preventing the formation of a single large group (Belbin 1993; Wardell-Johnson & Williams 1996) . We examined the acceptability of the resulting site groups and patterns using semi-strong hybrid multidimensional scaling ordination. The ordination was considered in conjunction with the minimum spanning tree (MST) and dendogram.The MST represents pairwise associations between group objects. Its use is comple-mentary to ordination and may be used practically to confirm or deny close relationships or identify trends in the data (Belbin 1993) . The dendogram schematically displays the hierarchical clustering of groups.The number of site groups was adjusted until maximum congruence was obtained between the ordination, MST and dendogram, thereby indicating that the most robust site groupings had been attained.",

The two most commonly captured reptile species, C. virgatus and L. delicata, dominated Group 1 sites (n = 24), being identified at 92% and 67% of sites, respectively (Fig. 3a) .This indicates a high degree of overlap in the distribution of these species within Group 1. However, these skink species showed little or no overlap in the 12 and 13 sites that, respectively, comprised Groups 2 and 3. Group 2 sites were characterized by the ubiquitous presence of L. delicata (detected in all sites) and the absence of C. virgatus (Fig. 3a) . The presence of C. virgatus rather than L. delicata dominated Group 3 (38% and 8%, respectively) (Fig. 3a) . Species' richness also varied between groups, with Group 3 containing the highest overall native species richness (12 species), more than 40% greater species richness than Group 2 (Fig. 3a) . Group 4 represented the fewest sites (n = 10) and was characterized by a total absence of native reptile species. MCAO reported eight native reptile species that were highly correlated with the ordination of reptile groups: Carlia foliorum, Carlia vivax, Cryptoblepharus virgatus, Dendrelaphis punctulata, Diporiphora australis, L. delicata, Carlia pectoralis, and V. varius (Fig. 2b) . Of these species, the presence of C. virgatus, L. delicata, and C. vivax explained the largest amount of variation in the ordination (r 2 = 0.52, 0.67 and 0.35, respectively) and were highly significant at P < 0.001 (Table 3) . C. foliorum, and D. australis were less significant (P < 0.05). Although C. pectoralis, D. punctulata, and V. varius were highly correlated with the ordination, these species were not found to be statistically significant (Table 3 ).

Our results initially appear to imply that both vegetation composition (weed cover and grass trees) and habitat structure (termite mounds, wood volume and soil compaction) are important for native reptile and small mammal species. However, when previous research and species' behaviours and life history traits are examined, it seems likely that species in this study were responding to the structural role fulfilled by weed cover and grass trees rather than the compositional or floristic role. Therefore, we conclude that at the local-level, habitat structural complexity is more important than vegetation composition for the occurrence of terrestrial, native reptile and small mammal species in Brisbane's lowland remnant habitat fragments.",

Many of these and similar studies indicate distinct speciesspecific responses to particular habitat attributes, yet it was not possible in our study to identify speciesspecific relationships because of the low detection rate of many species in several sites. The low detection of several species may potentially be explained by localized species' declines owing to urbanization and its associated disturbances and/or, owing to the cryptic nature of habitat use, dietary preferences and seasonal population fluctuations resulting in a high degree of false-absences. Additional surveys conducted over a longer time period are likely to have improved detection rates, added certainty to our results and, provided more information on the habitat preferences of individual species. However, such long-term surveys were not possible in this study owing to time and resource constraints. Consequently, our analysis focused on the influence of habitat characteristics on native reptile and small mammal species' compositions rather than individual species' occurrences.",

Weediness was particularly associated with Group 2 which was characterized by comparatively 'secretive' reptile species such as L. delicata, L. amicula and Burton's snake-lizard (Lialis burtonis). Although all species require habitats that facilitate thermoregulation, Group 2 species appear to tolerate of a moderate amount of certain habitat disturbances (as indicated by weediness), so long as adequate vegetation cover is available either to facilitate thermoregulation or to provide rapid refuge from predators.This is consistent with Bragg et al. (2005) who found that L. delicata was more likely to inhabit forested areas, which had more leaf litter, ground and shrub cover than the adjoining open habitat of regenerating minedisturbed areas. Furthermore, in our study L. delicata, unlike C. virgatus, were more likely identified from pitfall captures than direct observations, a trend that is indicative of the more cryptic nature of L. delicata. Similar capture trends were noted by Singh et al. (2002) for L. delicata and C. virgatus surveyed in contiguous forest near Brisbane. L. burtonis and Pseudechis porphyriacus were also identified from direct observations as pitfall traps were not large enough to trap these larger-bodied species. However, upon detection, these species were observed to actively seek refuge within relatively dense thickets of lower-stratum vegetation.",

(2004) reported that overall reptile species' richness was negatively associated with increased weediness. Our results provide some agreement with these previous findings. Moderate weed cover was most associated with Group 2 which, compared with Groups 1 and 3, also had the lowest overall native species richness. Further, the highest amount of weed cover (50-75%), although not significantly correlated with the ordination, appeared to be associated with Group 4 (no reptiles detected). Jellinek et al. (2004) discuss the possible influence of weediness and time since isolation, commenting on smaller and older remnants being more likely to be dominated by weeds than larger and younger remnants. This may potentially be critical for effectively managing reptile species' compositions investigated in the current study. As weed invasions are indicative of disturbed habitats, it seems likely that, as highlighted by Jellinek et al. (2004) and suggested by the current study's findings, certain reptile species are sensitive to habitat disturbances and so will respond negatively to even a low amount of weed cover. Conversely, some reptile species are able to tolerate a certain degree of habitat disturbance and may even benefit from the cover provided. It is therefore difficult to make generalizations of the importance of weeds for all reptiles.",

There are two possible explanations for this finding. The first directly implicates soil compaction and considers its impact on species' behaviours, whereas the second considers indirect implications of soil compaction, its associated disturbances on vegetation structure, and the resulting influence on reptile species. Soil compaction was least associated with Group 1, indicating that reptiles in this group occur more frequently in habitats with soft soils. This is consistent with the two fossorial skink species identified, C. scutirostrum and Anomalopus verreauxii, which were found only at sites within this group. Owing to their burrowing behaviour, these species do no inhabit or persist in areas with hardened soils where burrowing is difficult.",

Increased soil compaction is often a result and a consequence of decreased vegetation cover (e.g. Groves & Keller 1983; Hadden & Westbrooke 1996) . This cyclic condition is intensified by external disturbances which directly compact the soil and destroy ground cover vegetation. Hence, habitats with compacted soils are also likely to be indicative of highly disturbed habitats. Inappropriate fire regimes (including arson fires) and aesthetic clearing which decrease vegetation cover and do not promote vegetation regeneration are likely to increase soil compaction and, in turn, make it more difficult for plant species to regenerate (Amrein et al. 2005) . As a result, the habitat structure and soil condition degrades, negatively impacting on various reptile species dependent on structurally complex habitats. Similarly, off-track trampling within urban bushland habitats compacts soil and destroys or degrades ground cover vegetation, making these habitats less suitable for reptiles.",

This is consistent with previous studies (e.g. Bennett 1993; Haering & Fox 1995; Monjeau et al. 1998; Vernes 2003; Monamy & Fox 2005) which concluded that vegetation structure, rather than vegetation composition, was more important for small mammal occurrence, although species-specific responses to various aspects of structure were evident. For instance, small-bodied mammals, such as dasyurids, are likely to be more capable of moving rapidly through dense undergrowth, whereas largebodied mammals such as kangaroos are impeded by dense midstorey cover, but are less likely to be affected by dense understorey and ground cover. Comparatively, large areas of dense undergrowth may present a significant locomotor (and escape) obstacle for medium-bodied mammals, such as bandicoots, and may also inhibit bipedal vigilance behaviours (Garden 2000) . Vernes (2003) found that northern bettongs (Bettongia tropicana) avoided areas of dense ground cover, particularly dense cover within 0.5 m above ground, which approximates the height of an adult bettong. Keiper and Johnson (2004) similarly reported that short-nosed bandicoots (Isoodon obesulus peninsulae) in north Queensland forests avoided habitats with a tall, dense grass understorey. Such a response is also likely to be true for bandicoots in urban landscapes and so these animals may actively select habitats that are structurally complex, yet are not vegetatively dense. Therefore, as suggested by previous bandicoot studies (e.g. Dufty 1994; Scott et al. 1999; Chambers & Dickman 2002) , optimal habitats for Peramelidae are structurally complex and encapsulate a mosaic of open foraging areas and denser shelter sites that are not so dense as to impede locomotor ability.",

(2005) similarly found that native bush rats (Rattus fuscipes) responded negatively to the decrease in grass tree cover following fires. Likewise, Lunney (1995) commented that 'cover-seeking' R. fuscipes prefer habitats with dense ground and understorey cover -a structural requirement that would be partially filled by the presence of grass trees in the understorey layer. Grass trees have also been documented as providing important nesting habitats for small dasyurid species such as the common dunnart (Fox 1995) and the yellow-footed antechinus (Marchesan & Carthew 2004) . Our results support these previous findings, in that the presence of grass trees was most strongly associated with Group 2, which was dominated by dasyurids and R. fuscipes.",

            "text": "Soil compaction, as for reptiles, was also associated with mammal species occurrences. Like reptiles, mammal species also appear to avoid habitats with very hard soils and the reasons may be similar. First, certain mammal species such as some dasyurids may nest in terrestrial burrows (Woolley 1989 ; J. Garden, pers. obs. 2005) and harder soils would inhibit their ability to burrow. However, unlike the reptile results, certain mammal species appear to respond positively to compacted soils. Mammal Group 3 was most strongly associated with moderately compacted soils rather than very hard soils. This group was dominated by the Peramelidae (bandicoot species). Bandicoots are omnivorous and most commonly feed on subterranean invertebrate prey and plant structures such as roots and hypogeal fungi (Vernes 2003; Keiper & Johnson 2004) , a behaviour that is obvious from the conical diggings left from foraging (Triggs 1996; J. Garden, pers. obs. 2005 J. Garden, pers. obs. -2006 . Their ability to obtain these food resources is possible owing to specialized strong claws on their forefeet which make them powerful diggers. This morphological trait may provide them with an advantage over other species in enabling them to penetrate into harder soils and therefore utilize habitats with increased soil compaction. However, if soils become too hard, vegetation cover decreases (Amrein et al. 2005) , resulting in decreased soil moisture and microbial activity, and hence less food availability and increased energy output (for foraging). Structurally complex habitats are likely to occur where there is low to moderately compacted soils influencing vegetation floristics and cover. In addition, although bandicoots appear to prefer structurally open habitats for foraging, they have also been reported to require structurally dense habitats for diurnal shelter (e.g. Dufty 1994; Southgate et al. 1996; Chambers & Dickman 2002; Vernes 2003) . Therefore, as soils harden and vegetation cover decreases, important food resources decrease as does critical vegetation cover. However, in the urban landscape, Dufty (1994) reported that the easternbarred bandicoot (Perameles gunii) used a range of natural and artificial structures as shelter sites, implying a certain degree of disturbance tolerance, including moderately compacted soils.",

            "text": "Although it is important to understand the habitat requirements of individual fauna species, when the goal is conserving, restoring or increasing native fauna diversity, habitats must not be managed based on the requirements of a single species. This is often difficult owing to the variety of species-specific responses and the cryptic nature of many native Australian terrestrial fauna. A potential way to address this challenge and facilitate effective management of habitats for multiple species is to construct ecological species profiles (Opdam et al. 2002) . Such profiles enable various species to be categorized based on similarities in their habitat requirements and disturbance responses. The resulting ecological species profiles may then be used to guide habitat management decisions, such as priority areas, actions and funding allocation, and facilitate the long-term conservation of multiple species. In addition, long-term monitoring of remnant habitat fragments, and associated adaptive management strategies, is recommended in order to minimize inherent problems of short-term studies such as false-absence records and seasonal fluctuations in species diversity and abundance.",
