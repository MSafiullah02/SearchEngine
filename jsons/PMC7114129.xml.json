The clinical symptoms of cholera are mainly induced by the cholera toxin (CT) released by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae in the small intestine of the host (Holmgren, 1981). The CT is an AB5 holotoxin with molecular mass of 85 kDa composed of five B subunits (CTB) noncovalently linked to the A subunit (CTA). The CTB is a 58 kDa non-toxic pentameric subunit of CT that binds specifically to the membrane lipid ganglioside GM1 on the surface of target human intestinal epithelial cells, promoting CT endocytosis. CTA is a 27-kDa protein with an enzymatic toxic ability that is proteolitically cleaved within the host cell in the domains A1 and A2 (Lhoir et al., 1990, Spangler, 1992). Integral CT travels from the plasma membrane of the epithelial cells to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the toxic subunit A1 crosses the membrane into the cytosol and ADP-ribosylates a trimeric G protein to activate adenylyl cyclase (Fujinaga et al., 2003, Lencer and Tsai, 2003). The consequent stimulated production of cyclic AMP by intoxicated cells initiates a metabolic cascade that results in the excessive secretion of fluids and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, characteristic of the disease (Bernardi et al., 2008).",

The refolding of oligomers present the additional drawback that is the necessity of high protein concentration, a condition that potentially induce the association of misfolded monomers and that can favor reaggregation instead of the proper association of the monomers. HHP was previously described to be a useful tool for solubilization of aggregated proteins, enabling for the refolding of monomeric (Chura-Chambi et al., 2008, Chura-Chambi et al., 2013, Fraga et al., 2010, Malavasi et al., 2011) and oligomeric proteins (Foguel et al., 1999). In the present study we present the refolding of CTB expressed as IB in E. coli to the pentameric and biologically active state utilizing HHP to solubilize the aggregates. We show that the association of the monomers occurs at atmospheric pressure after the treatment at HHP with a relatively high yield (45%).",

For the expression of CTB, a colony was randomly picked from transformants that were grown on LB plates (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl) containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicilin and inoculated in 2-HKSII rich medium (Jensen and Carlsen, 1990). Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C, and the expression of CTB was induced by addition of isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mM) when the O.D. at A\n600 nm reached approximately 3. The culture was separated into flasks that were then incubated at different temperatures (20 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C). After incubation with constant orbital agitation (150 rpm) for a 16 h period, bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 2500 \u00d7 \ng for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mM EDTA. Lysozyme, at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml, was added to the suspension, followed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature. The suspension was sonicated in the presence of 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and centrifuged at 8000 \u00d7 \ng for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was suspended in 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, with 5 mM EDTA and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate.

To verify if the temperature of bacterial host cultivation affects the recombinant CTB fractionation into soluble/insoluble fractions, the transformed bacteria induced for CTB expression at different temperatures of cultivation were analyzed (Fig. 1\n). The CTB is largely expressed in the form of insoluble precipitates regardless of the temperature of production, in the range 20\u201337 \u00b0C. The refolding of proteins from IB produced by bacteria cultivated at low temperature was shown to produce proteins presenting structure that resemble the corresponding native state (Vera et al., 2007). Additionally, cultivation at high temperature promotes the formation of more stable aggregates, as this condition favors intermolecular interactions at the expense of native intramolecular contacts (de Groot and Ventura, 2006). Therefore, in order to produce CTB aggregates as similar as possible to the native protein and requiring milder conditions for solubilization, we chose to express this protein in the lowest temperature tested (20 \u00b0C).",

Thus, moderate pressures (1\u20133 kbar) are generally effective for dissociating protein oligomers and aggregates, whereas protein denaturation generally requires higher pressure levels (>3 kbar) (Silva et al., 2006). The solubilization of insoluble aggregates is the first step in the refolding processes. The refolding of proteins presenting secondary native-like structures can be improved in comparison to proteins denatured by the presence of high levels of urea or guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), a step required for IB solubilization in the traditional refolding process at atmospheric pressure. Thus, the advantage of using HHP is to solubilize aggregated proteins in a relatively mild condition for posterior refolding. Hydrogen bonds are insensitive to pressure and low levels of urea or GdnHCl may be necessary to improve the solubilization of the IBs exerted at HHP (St John et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The reaggregation from misfolded species after removal of the factor that promotes solubilization of the aggregates, such as high pressure or denaturing concentration of urea or GdnHCl, is the main cause of low levels of refolding yields. Therefore, inhibition of protein interactions that lead to intermolecular contacts and aggregation can be an effective strategy to suppress the formation of these states. The presence of chemical compounds, such as low concentrations of chaotropic agents, amino acids, surfactants and osmolytes can be a useful tool to avoid reaggregation and improve refolding yields (Qoronfleh et al., 2007, Shukla et al., 2011). However, for the refolding of oligomeric proteins, a balance must be found between favoring the native inter-monomer interactions and disfavoring of non-native contacts that lead to aggregation. In order to evaluate the utility of the presence of additives, we compressed suspensions of CTB IB in the presence of low levels of GdnHCl (1.5 M) and the other reagents (shown in Fig. 2A) at 2.4 kbar, a pressure level condition that usually promotes the dissociation of the aggregates, followed by step decompression and centrifugation to remove insoluble aggregates and dialysis of the soluble fraction to remove the additives. In the samples that were compressed in the absence of additives, no bands corresponding to the pentameric form of CTB are seen in the SDS-PAGE of the soluble fraction of the treated IB suspension. However, the presence of the surfactants that were analyzed, Triton X-100, and especially Tween 20, contributed for the obtainment of the CTB pentamer. The immunoblot (Fig. 2B) shows that in addition to the monomer and pentamer, an intermediate form, possibly a trimeric form of CTB, is also present in the soluble fraction. Our results indicate that Tween 20 leads to a productive CTB folding pathway, assisting in oligomerization of CTB to the pentameric form. Tween is a polyoxyethylene sorbitol ester, a nonionic surfactant that contains hydrophobic groups that was shown to reduce the extent of self-association and aggregation, improving the refolding yield of the human monomeric growth hormone, possibly driven by hydrophobic interactions with the protein (Bam et al., 1996). It was also previously shown that the presence of nonionic surfactants can assist for the refolding of the oligomeric proteins OmpA (Wang et al., 2013) and OmpF (Visudtiphole et al., 2005).",

At temperatures below the freezing point of water, the hydrophobic effect, which is considered the main driving force for protein folding and also for intermolecular protein interactions that leads to aggregation is weakened because at low temperatures the interaction of non polar amino acids with water is favored (Tsai et al., 2002).

The incubation for 1.5 h at 2.4 kbar (schemes 1, 3\u20136), was effective to disaggregate IB (Fig. 3) however incubation at this pressure for a longer time, 16 h (scheme 2), increased the yield of soluble monomeric CTB. Thus, in order to generate higher concentration of soluble monomeric forms, likely able to interact for the oligomerization to the native pentamer, the compression for 16 h at 2.4 kbar was utilized for the subsequent assays. Incubation at the intermediary pressures of 0.8 kbar (scheme 4), 0.4 kbar (scheme 5) or 0.2 kbar (scheme 6) was not useful for increasing the concentration of neither CTB monomers nor pentamers. The application of 2.4 kbar for 1.5 h and incubation at 1 bar for 16 h (scheme 1) was the most effective scheme to obtain pentameric CTB, which suggests that the formation of oligomers occurs preferentially at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, incubation at atmospheric pressure during longer periods of time was subsequently analyzed.",

The incubation at 2.4 kbar for 16 h and direct decompression to 1 bar yielded the highest level of monomeric protein and incubation for longer periods at atmospheric pressure was essential to increase the yield of pentameric CTB. Another important factor to obtain high yields of the pentameric form of CTB was the incubation at high (960 \u03bcg/ml) protein concentration. Purification of CTB and separation of the forms generated after the high pressure treatment has proved troublesome due to the presence of monomeric forms together with the pentamers of interest.
