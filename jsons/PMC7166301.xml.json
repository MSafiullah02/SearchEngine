All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria [3]. Sixty six COVID-19 patients with MAFLD were included in the analyses and were divided into two groups [those with obesity (n = 45) and those without (n = 21)]. All patients received standard treatment based on the COVID-19 Management Guidance (7th edition) [8]. This study was approved by the local ethics review boards of all three hospitals.

In the current analysis, the risk of severe illness in MAFLD patients with co-existing obesity was >6-fold greater after adjustment for confounders. These findings are distinct, suggesting that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is significantly greater in those with MAFLD. However, the virological and physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship we observed is not clarified by the present data. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, a common complication in severe COVID-19 [12], is promoted by the activation of CD14+ and CD16+ inflammatory monocytes producing a larger amount of interleukin (IL)-6 and other proinflammatory factors. This suggests IL-6 is a key proinflammatory factor that triggers the inflammatory \u201cstorm\u201d in patients [13]. In MAFLD patients, particularly those with obesity, increased inflammatory activity in the liver and visceral fat is independently correlated with increased levels of IL-6 [14], which might have an additive/synergistic role in promoting greater severity of COVID-19. It is conceivable that the secretion of hepatokines for example, reduced adiponectin or the altered secretion of inflammatory lipid mediators in obese patients with MAFLD [15], may also contribute to the current observations.",

Waist circumference, a risk factor for MAFLD, was not measured in our patients, which precluded adjustment of this confounder. In addition, patients were of Asian ethnicity and thus the applicability of the results to other ethnic groups is uncertain.
