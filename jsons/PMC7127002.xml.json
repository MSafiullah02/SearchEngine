It is often the case that a city has multiple public special service phone numbers, such as 110-public security, 119-fire alarm, 120-first aid and 122-traffic police. It is not easy for the public to keep them all in mind. And there are some other emergency phone numbers even more rarely known to common people.\u2022That city has no a centralized command and control system for all types of emergency sub-systems results in difficulties for different emergency command centers and departments to mutually support and coordinate timely and effectively. Their respective data resources cannot be shared so that some cities repeated construction of data resources and wasted their limited resources.\u2022As Emergency Response Systems are complicate, it is not easy for the public to remember and understand operating modes of different systems.

Wang (2000) discussed spatial data and spatial analysis requirements for chemical monitoring and emergency response in detail and studied a chemical monitoring and Emergency Response System under development by combining GIS and expert system for both chemical distribution centers and public response personnel. Ford and Schmidt identify nine ways that emergency response training programs can be modified to improve the effectiveness of nuclear power plant personnel who must respond to accident conditions (Ford and Schmidt, 2000). Chunlin et al. (1999) and Wang and He (2002) established a multi-objective dispatch model based on \u201cthe earliest emergency-start-time\u201d and \u201cthe fewest number of selected depots\u201d. The optimal and worst solutions of each objective function are obtained, and the solution with the earliest start-time under the fewest number is found. Xin et al. (2000) studied the dispatching process of urban fire fighting using non-autonomous colored Petri net and simulated the dispatching process of the Shanghai 119 Command Center. The City of Chicago\u2019s Department of Environment developed and implemented a Flood and Storm Emergency Response Plan. Key components of the Plan included identification and prioritization of at-risk facilities, design of mitigation measures, preparedness, procurement of additional flood-fighting equipment, and designation of available resources for response and recovery. Since 1997 the plan has been activated several times, with the result that disruption and damage to Lake Shore Drive and other City infrastructure has been reduced (Wagstaff and Ferguson, 2002).",

In the Petri net, the moving of tokens represents the information process. The markings of the Petri net represent the special state of the system. Forward markings decide the set of all possible states of the system with a given initial state. In the continuous-time stochastic Petri net, one transition needs certain time delay from being generable to practical execution, that is, the period from a transition being generable to its execution is regarded as a continuous random variant which is subject to exponential distribution. It has been proved that a stochastic Petri net is isomorphic to a continuous-time MC. Application of stochastic Petri net to system performance analysis includes the following steps (Rongxi, 1997):\u2022Set up the stochastic Petri net model for the system.\u2022Define possible states of the stochastic Petri net, that is, derive its reachable marking set.\u2022Build up the isomorphic MC of the stochastic Petri net.\u2022Analyze the system performance based on the stable probability of MC.\n",

Such systems may command and control all fielded public security, traffic police, fire fighting and first aid resources, help emergency controllers to select best resources to make quick response to emergencies. Developed countries generally use single special service phone number for emergency, such as 911 in US, 999 in UK, 110 in Japan and South Korea and 900 in Sweden (Farazmand, 2001). However, UERS in China is still in the stage with multiple emergency service phone numbers co-existing. Urban emergency phone numbers generally include mayor\u2019s open number, 110 for public security, 119 for fire fighting, 120 for first aid, 122 for traffic police, 12315 for consumers\u2019 complaints, and 148 for legal aid number. Such command systems and information network system share various resources and realize unified inter-function and inter-alarm-area command and control among different alarms. China\u2019s built-up UERS allow municipal leaders to call officials responsible for different departments in the emergency center during major events to carry out special command and control for dealing with such events. Wireless communication systems facilitate two-way transmission of voice, file and picture data between the emergency center persons on the event site. The truck-mounted wireless group communications station may be used as the temporary field command center, and may also be used to provide field emergency command communications for the blind zone of certain wireless group communication. The satellite image transmission system may transfer real-time field situations of major events to the emergency response center. Powerful data checking functions and wireless data transmission terminals facilitate field operators and command and control persons in the center to call various information in the center as well as on the truck on the mission. The main procedure of emergency response of UERS is shown in Fig. 2\n.",
