The disease has acquired endemic proportions in tropical countries where the hygienic conditions are not satisfactory while the environmental conditions favor the proliferation of parasite and its transmission, particularly through the female anopheles. It is obvious that to square up the problems, there is a need for designing and development of more effective drugs, which can combat the drug-resistant strains of the parasite. Molecular biology of the parasite and its homing into host cellular tropics provide multiple drug targets that could judiciously be considered for engineering and designing of new generation antimalarial drugs and also drug delivery systems. Though the recent reports document that against malaria parasite the vaccine could be developed, nevertheless, due to smart mutational change overs by the parasite, it is able to bypass the immune surveillance. The developed vaccine therefore failed to assure absolute protection against the malarial infection. In the conventional mode of treatment antimalarial drugs, the dose and dosage regimen that is followed at large crops up the contraindicative manifestations, and hence compromising the effective treatment. The emerging trends and new updates in contemporary biological sciences, material sciences, and drug delivery domain have enabled us with the availability of a multitude of mode and modules which could plunge upon the nanotechnology in particular to treat this challenging infection. The nanotechnology-based option may be tuned or customized as per the requirements to mark and target i.e. the infected RBCs, for targeted drug delivery.",

Although various approaches have been adopted for the eradication of malaria, still it remains a major health concern, particularly where it acquires an endemic dimension. Thus, malaria has drawn the attention of many researchers, especially in developing countries. This is due to the death of the children, pregnant women, and HIV-infected patients due to malaria [1] . According to the WHO, the worldwide total number of 219 million cases of malaria were reported in 2017 and out of the reported cases, 435,000 clinical death occurred. Although the disease is reported worldwide, yet most affected areas are tropical and subtropical regions. The causative organism of malaria is a protozoan pathogen of Plasmodium species. Malaria in humans is caused by four species of Plasmodium, e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. However, 5th species of Plasmodium is also reported, which normally infects animals; it is P. knowlesi. Malaria is transmitted by Plasmodium-infected female anopheles bites. Infected female anopheles injects sporozoite into the blood during its blood meal. Sporozoites travel through the vasculature from the skin and infect liver [2] .",

            "text": "The possibility of complete elimination and protection against malaria needs some effective antimalarial vaccine to be developed against the pre-erythrocytic stage of the cycle that may offer effective protection. The emergence of resistance against drugs and evasion of immune could lead to excessively high morbidity and mortality. It is not only drug resistance that is developed by the parasite but also pathogen borne toxicity; thus, they are a major concern. Other factors including patient compliance, misdiagnosis, incorrect dosing, poor drug quality, and poor living conditions taken together are responsible for the failure of malaria treatment. Therefore, this seems to be an imperative that delivery systems based on the current cutting edge technologies should be developed capable of circumventing the possibilities of drug resistance development. Because of various drawbacks of present malaria treatment as highlighted above, it is desirable that an attempt should be made to replace conventional monotherapy with combination therapy which reportedly reduces the occurrence of drug resistance. However, combination therapy too could not assure complete eradication of malaria infection [3] . Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) have become a primary clinical choice which results in rapid clearance of parasite. The combination therapy, however, appears to be costly and also suffers some added side effects. It is also dependent on the socioeconomic condition, drug-drug interaction, drug-food interactions, lacking the drug quality distributed in the malarious region, and self-medication which add to the existing challenges. Nevertheless, gene sequencing of P. falciparum and advancement in malaria genetics present several novel molecular targets for effective drug designing and also for targeted drug delivery [4] . Currently, various pharmaceutical companies and research agencies are involved in the drug discovery and development process of antimalarial therapy, which could be accomplished with the advancements of novel drugs with better pharmacokinetic profile and costeffectiveness and also suitable for the children and pregnant women [3] . Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of drawbacks of current antimalarial drug therapy.",

The erythrocytic membrane also contains proteins, which serve as receptors and transporters. Hence, antimalarial drugs can reach their target either by carrier-mediated transportation or diffusion through lipid membrane. Carrier-mediated transportation is referred to as facilitated diffusion in case energy is not utilized or active transport if energy is consumed in the process. Carrier-mediated transportation is saturable, subjected to inhibition and stereospecific. Uncharged chemicals exhibit lipid-based diffusion; however, charged molecules are not able to cross the lipid membrane [5] .",

Nanocarriers are below < 1000 nm in size. They are essentially colloidal nanoparticles characterized by high surface area to volume ratio [6] . Nanocarriers should be designed appreciating some important parameters including plasma concentration which is directly proportional to the toxic effects of the drugs and efficacy that in turn directly correlates with the area under the curve (AUC). Thus, to alter the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and achieve high drug concentration at the target site, these parameters become of paramount significance. PEGylated nanocarriers reportedly enhance the drug efficacy, reduce the dose of the drug, reduce the dosage frequency, and improve the AUC of the drug. The contact period or circulation time of nanocarrier is of importance in the treatment of malaria. Long circulation time enhances the interaction between RBCs and nanocarriers, ultimately leading to iRBCs specific targeting and improved efficacy [7] . The exact mechanism by which nanocarrier contained antimalarials are delivered to the infected RBCs is not clear. There are two proposed mechanisms, referred to as the traditional sequence pathway and a parallel pathway. Infected RBCs become leakier as compared with the normal RBC to fulfill their nutritional requirements from the extra RBC environment (fluid). Nanocarrier which is of the size below < 80 nm diameter may have direct access to the infected RBCs due to their leakiness. Thus, nanocarriers reach within the infected RBCs along with the contents. Selectivity could also be achieved by exploring this proposed mechanism because normal RBCs do not have a leaky membrane and hence a nanocarrier may enter directly into the infected RBCs only. Another proposed mechanism is membrane fusion, i.e., a drug bearing formulation fuses with iRBC membrane. There is a basic dissimilarity between these two pathways about the role of the cytosol of RBC. In the first proposed mechanism, nanocarrier is noticed to bypass the cytosol of RBC; in contrast, drug molecule passes through the cytosol in case of the second mechanism. New permeation pathways (NPP) are responsible for enhanced permeability of iRBCs to a small solute. Tubovesicular membrane (TVM) arises from the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane that extends up to RBC membrane [8] (Fig. 3) . TVM is near NPP, so nanocarrier having a size below 80 nm may sink directly into parasite while escaping the cytosol of RBCs. The secondary mechanism involves membrane fusion and active targeting to the iRBCs. In this mechanism, the drug enters the parasite via cytosol of the iRBC [9] .",

Alteration of the surface properties of nanocarriers such as PEGylation prevents its opsonization and further clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [11] . PEGylation is the phenomenon where nanocarriers are modified with the covalent conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Moreover, circulation time also increases by an increase in the molecular weight of the PEG chain. PEGylation is used to overcome various drawbacks associated with the biopharmaceutical parameters of a drug/carrier such as pharmacokinetic properties, drug solubility, immunogenicity, and low retention time. It enhances the retention time of the nanocarrier in the blood which is a prerequisite in the case of malaria [12] .

Blood stage of the Plasmodium parasite relies on glycolysis, as the main source of ATP production. Thus, glucose is a major need of the Plasmodium parasite and to fulfill its need hexose transporters 1 (PfHT1) are expressed on the surface of the iRBCs. PfHT1 and the mammalian glucose transporter (GLUT-1) are overexpressed on the infected erythrocyte, for increased uptake of glucose [21] . Shafi et al. use carbohydrates as a ligand to specifically target the infected RBCs. Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) exhibits competitive behavior with glucose for GLUT-1 binding. They prepared chloroquine-loaded chitosan nanoparticle with 170-200 nm in size with 50-57% entrapment efficiency. CSN is superior in terms of uptake and preferential targeting to the infected RBCs as compared with normal RBC. Parasite inhibition was achieved at 1 nM concentration, while free drug exhibited a comparative activity at 100 nM. It is convincing that specific targeting can reduce the dose and overcome the efflux-based drug resistance [22] .

Poorly water-soluble drugs can be effectively delivered and also the system may prevent drug degradation in the GIT. SMEDDS provides the larger surface area for the diffusion of the drug [43] . Primaquine is a gametocytocidal which is used to prevent transmission of malaria by preventing the spread of malaria. Primaquine, however, has some drawbacks like short halflife (5.6 h), first-pass metabolism, and dose-dependent side effects such as leukocytosis, methanoglobenmia, leukocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient patients. Thus, frequent administration of primaquine (PQ) is needed and sometimes it shows some severe adverse effects. To overcome these issues, PQ was encapsulated in the SMEDDS to achieve higher therapeutic efficacy. Chudiwal and coworkers delivered the primaquine (PQ) as a SMEDDS to enhance liver uptake and increase efficacy against the liver stages of P. vivax. Pharmacodynamic efficacy was evaluated by applying Peter 's Four Day Suppressive Test in a murine model. SMEDDS show higher antimalarial efficacy than marketed formulations. Results of biodistribution studies suggest that SMEDDS are specifically targeted to the liver [44] . Thus, it is a suitable carrier for liver-stage malaria.",

Thus, curcumin-loaded F\u0394Fnanoformulation shows greater parasite inhibition as compared with free curcumin in malaria-infected mice. The biocompatible short peptide-based nanoparticles appear to be an excellent carrier for the loading of hydrophobic antimalarials [62] .

Trimer is most active against HCMV in vitro replication and has a EC50 value of 0.026 \u03bcm. [58] the pathogenesis of CM as a marker of severity. These are the submicron vesicles (200-1000 nm diameter) released from the cells in the microvasculature such as platelets, endothelial cells, erythrocyte, and leucocytes. During CM, neurological symptoms are increased as the level of MV increases. MV analysis gives a strong basis, which helps to understand the pathophysiology of CM. miRNA is the small, non-coding single-stranded RNA, which helps to control 30% of protein-coding genes via post-transcriptional regulation and RNA silencing. microRNA within the MV showed to be dysregulated in malaria. Cohen et al. worked on the microRNA cargo of MV to understand the pathogenesis of CM. miRNA changes were recorded in CBA-infected mice with P. berghei ANKA strain and P. yoelii, which are responsible for severe malaria devoid of cerebral complications hence termed as non-CM. A comparison of the MV with healthy and CM mice for miRNA expression using microarrays was made. The results reveal that miRNA plays an important role in inflammation and dysregulation during CM, which is critical for the beginning of neurological syndrome through the regulation of downstream targets [63] . Clinical development of Pfs25 is hindered due to its limited immunogenicity. It is a transmission-blocking vaccine antigen candidate. Thus, to enhance its immunogenicity, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged Pfs25 is mixed with the preformed liposomes which contain cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid; thus at the time of immunization, nanoliposome antigen particleization (SNAP) 762 formation takes place. The antigen is stably presented on phospholipid bilayer, without covalent modification, and hence retains antigen conformation. The histidine-tagged P. falciparum polypeptide was found to induce strong antibody production and could be useful in the preparation of multistage particulate vaccines using SNAP for immunization [64] .",

Seemingly, it can improvise the existing conventional drug delivery modules and also it can improve the therapeutic outcome of the drug discernibly and may allow curtailing down the contraindicated manifestations well below the tolerable limits. Most of the nano biotechnological have demonstrated improved and effective performance at preclinical stages. However, the results at the end have been discouraging due to toxicological and interactive manifestations of such drug delivery systems. There appears to be a gap between preclinical and clinical phases inviting intensive, consistent, and sincere attention of researchers to logistically design and develop the systems for their safe and effective use. It is appreciated that the molecular interplay involved in the malaria parasite invasion and its subsequent proliferation and molecular mechanistic involved therein can open up the vistas of multiple options, opportunity, potential, and promises based on molecular events and judicious intervention thereon, which could only be possible through nanobiotechnological stratagems. The target (infected RBCs) could be selectively delivered with a load of drug which could not only eradicate the parasitemia but also the problem associated with drug resistance that emerges due to sub-therapeutic drug exposure. The nanobiotechnology may include the use of site-directing antibodies, aberrant and variant expression of protein determinant on infected cells, biodevices developed as a variant, and bioprocesses and also the smart material which could be developed by structuring a drug/drug(s) carrier selective or with proficiency to the target site. Adding to the proposed possibilities, the molecular modifications as nutrient-based prodrug and antimetabolites could be other possible diversities that can be brought in place in the designing, development, and tailoring of drug delivery systems for exclusive use in cellselective targeted drug delivery.",
