            "text": "The diagnosis of bacterial infections in the laboratory relies on isolation of the bacterium, its identification, and antibiograms. This direct diagnostic approach is limited by: the delay before obtaining culture results, sometimes after caregiving; the presence of non-cultivable bacteria in the sample because of the presence of inhibitors such as antibiotics or because of inappropriate culture conditions; and the capacity to isolate and differentiate the various colonies of a polymicrobial sample. For example, around 75% of bacterial species in the digestive microbiotium, cannot be identified routinely with culture techniques [1]. An alternative to this direct diagnostic is the detection de universal gene sequences 16S rRNA or rpoB [2], [3] by PCR followed by hybridization of a fluorescent oligonucleotide probe, with real time PCR [4]. As an alternative, the product of PCR amplification may be hybridized on a solid base fixing a great number of oligonucleotide probes, using the DNA microarray technique which is reviewed in this article. Searching for \u201cDNA microarray\u201d in the NCBI search engine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) gives 60,630 references (May 2012), showing the importance of the molecular biology tool described for the first time in 1995 [5] (Fig. 1\n). The \u201cDNA microarray and infectious diseases\u201d combination, gives 721 references (May 2012); the first reported use of this tool, for the diagnosis of a hantavirus infection, was published in 1993 [6].",

The probes correspond to: universal genes 16S rRNA [2] or rpoB\n[3]; or to genus, species, or serotype specific genes; to genes coding for resistance to antibiotics; or to toxinic genes. The DNA microarray technique includes several steps, such as manual or automatic extraction of nucleic acids from the clinical sample, their amplification by PCR, the labeling of amplification products by a fluorescent cyanine (Cy3- or Cy5-dCTP): a monochrome labeling is less expensive but a two-colored one has a better reproducibility [7], [8]; then hybridization of labeled nucleic acids for 24 to 50 hours on the DNA microarray which is later scanned to measure the specific probe/DNA interactions of the sample. These interactions are measured by fluorescence as numerical data (Fig. 2\n). The total time for the procedure is inferior to 4 hours, not including time for hybridization.",

Among these, the intestinal microbiota counting 1011 to 1014 bacteria [11] has a major role in the individual's homeostasis and in some diseases [12]. Three teams studied the intestinal microbiota with DNA microarrays carrying the probes of 25 to 40 bases targeting the 16S rRNA gene and detecting from 500 to 1140 bacterial species [11], [13], [14]. These authors reported that the intestinal microbiota includes a part found in all individuals belonging to phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, and a part specific to each individual [13]. DNA microarrays also allowed observing a decrease of some Firmicutes and an increase of Enterococcus, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria spp. species in patients presenting with Crohn's disease compared to healthy individuals [14].",

The authors of the second study analyzed the oral microbiota in 74 children 3 to 18 years of age, in four different groups according to the development stage of their teeth: (1) milk teeth, (2) early mixed dentition, (3) late mixed dentition, and (4) final dentition. The results of the two studies prove that Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria are the most prevalent phyla in the oral microbiota depending on the individual's dentition: there are more proteobacteria than bacteroidetes in the final dentition group, contrary to the 3 other groups. The prevalence of Prevotella increases with age [16]. Finally, Porphyromonas catoniae and Neisseiria flavescens are significantly correlated to the presence of carries [16].",

A second kind of DNA microarray targets the virulence genes of enteropathogenic bacteria, for a combined detection of E. coli, V. cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, S. enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, and L. monocytogenes\n[22]; or of enterotoxinogenic E. coli [ETEC], enterohemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC], S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. flexneri, S. sonnei, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Y. enterocolitica\n[23]; or of the 19 most frequent serogroups of enterotoxic E. coli\n[24]. A common limitation of all these chips is sensibility of detection. Indeed, some enteropathogens such as Salmonella spp. or Campylobacter spp. are presents in low inoculum less or equal to 103 organisms/mL of diarrhea stools [25], [26]. These inoculums are at the DNA microarray's threshold of detection [20], [21], because of interference with some commensal species. A PCR amplification stage of pathogens before hybridization partly decreases this limitation [21].",

Indeed, DNA microarrays allow a microbiological diagnosis within 48 hours (including hybridization time) compatible with the delay for medical management of patients. DNA microarrays also allow multiplexed detection adapted to a syndromic approach of infectious diseases diagnosis and to the diagnosis of polymicrobial infections extended to viruses. All authors agree that DNA microarrays have a sensibility and specificity at least equal to reference tests.",

The various chosen probes should have a very similar length and fusion temperature to optimize hybridization conditions, the current limiting stage. Several teams have solved the problem of cross-reaction by fixing, on the slide, specific probes for the same pathogen, in a redundant manner, and the current standard is a triplicate test. The sample preparation and the labeling of nucleic acids should be even more simplified for a routine use in bacteriological laboratories, to decrease time and cost of the test, and to integrate DNA microarrays among available techniques for the diagnostic point-of-care of infectious diseases [44]. Indeed, the currently available techniques, real time PCR and immunochromatographic methods are rapid diagnostic methods for a single pathogen per test. DNA microarrays have the advantage to allow multiplexed diagnosing perfectly adapted to a syndromic approach of infectious diseases diagnosis.",
