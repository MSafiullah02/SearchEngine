For a number of reasons, including microbiologic safety, non-human primates are no longer considered to be the preferred animal organ source despite their immunologic closeness to humans [2\u00b15] . Most effort is being directed to the use of the pig, for reasons that have been elucidated and discussed elsewhere [6, 7] . Although several major immunologic hurdles need to be overcome, the pig has many logistic advantages, one of which is its suitability for genetic manipulation, which can, for example, provide its organs with some protection against human complement [8] . The risk regarding the potential for the transfer of infectious agents to the human recipient with the transplanted tissues or organ is considered less if the pig (rather than a non-human primate) is the source (donor) animal. The very few studies carried out to try to assess this risk have been largely limited to an assessment of non-viral agents, and have demonstrated that swine [commercial speci\u00aeed pathogen free (SPF)] are largely free of bacteria, fungi and parasites that might be pathogenic in humans [9] . Nevertheless, some concern remains [10\u00b112].",

            "text": "With human organ donors, present technology is able to identify most serious pathogens, such as toxoplasma, hepatitis viruses, and human immunode\u00aeciency viruses, but the presence of one or more of these agents is sometimes accepted when the patient's condition is critical. Other organisms, which are likely to cause disease that may be considered less serious, such as cytomegalovirus and Epstein\u00b1Barr virus, are commonly knowingly transferred from donor to host; to exclude them would entail excluding an unacceptably high number of potential donors. Although there will be much greater control over the microbiologic status of specially bred and housed swine, there remains an unknown risk of the transfer of a porcine infectious agent that is not seen in humans. This risk may not be restricted to the recipient, but may have consequences for public health. For example, as pig endogenous retroviruses (PoERVs) are present in the pig cell genome [10\u00b115], their transfer with the transplant would be inevitable. This does not necessarily imply, however, that PoERVs would be expressed, propagated, transmitted and become pathogenic in humans. With implantation of a pig organ into a human patient, many barriers to infection are bypassed. If an infection with a pig agent were established in a patient, further adaptation to the host may follow. Several recent examples of interspecies transmission of viruses accompanied by adaptation to a new host have been reported [16, 17] . The immunosuppression required to prevent xenograft rejection further reduces the host's resistance to infection.",

Several bacteria, viruses and protozoa express Gal on their cell sufaces, and anti-Gal antibodies may form part of the body's immune defence mechanism against them [19, 20] . Weiss [21] has emphasized that lysis of certain nonhuman retroviruses is triggered in humans by the binding of anti-Gal antibodies to Gal residues expressed on the viral envelope [22\u00b124]. Many current strategies for xenotransplantation involve depletion of anti-Gal antibodies and/or suppression of Gal-reactive B cells. Such modi\u00aecations may remove a barrier to infection with both PoERVs and other infectious agents.",

This may provide opportunities for human viruses to infect the porcine organ. It has been shown, for instance, that two of these human complement regulatory proteins are receptors for human viral pathogens [21] . CD46 can function as a cell surface coreceptor for the measles virus [25] and CD55 can serve as a binding receptor for Echo and Coxsackie B viruses [26, 27] . A theoretical possibility is that human viruses might adapt to replication in transgenic pig tissue. Consequently, transgenic pigs may become susceptible to human and other viruses to which they were not susceptible previously. Subsequent transmission to domestic and wild pigs could have adverse economic and environmental consequences. Consideration of this issue is, however, beyond the remit of this paper.",

The alternative would be for the source pigs to be naturally farrowed and, after \u00aeve days, undergo segregated early weaning (Isowean) [28, 29] , which is known to minimize the transmission of undesirable microorganisms from the\u00afora of the breeding herd. This method is probably preferable when large numbers of pigs are being bred (and will be considered the method of choice for the purposes of this paper). Whichever method is chosen for delivery and initial care, each cohort of pigs (perhaps 10 to 20 in number) will subsequently be reared in strict isolation in separate barriers away from the breeding herd. Such barrier techniques are well-established in the rearing of high-health and immunocompromised laboratory animals.

In addition to the swine-speci\u00aec viruses, many other viruses must be rigorously excluded.

Genetic variation within retroviruses is favored by the lack of \u00aedelity of reverse transcriptase. Moreover, there is the potential for recombination between the porcine retrovirus and endogenous retroviral elements within the human genome [57] . The potential risk of PoERV can therefore be evaluated at several levels. Will virus be produced from the cells of the xenografted organ?

It should be emphasized, however, that the latter two approaches suffer from some limitations. First, the susceptibility of non-human primates to PoERV infection may differ from that of humans. Secondly, most humans who have been exposed to viable pig tissues to date have not been severely immunocompromised, and exposure to these tissues has in many cases been relatively short. However, detailed studies on the PoERV status of persons transiently exposed to living porcine tissues have recently been published [58\u00b160], and have been encouraging in being unable to identify any de\u00aenite transmission of PoERVs to the recipients. In view of these \u00aendings, limited, carefully controlled trials of pig organ transplantation may be the only means of con\u00aerming whether there is a quanti\u00aeable risk of PoERV infection from xenotransplantation. We would suggest that the unequivocal detection of the PoERV genome in non-human primate or human cells, or the detection of a plasma viremia, would be cause to pause and review the development of a clinical trial of xenotransplantation using pig organs.",
