Furthermore, animal model data in diabetic mice indicate that ACE-2 activity may be increased in the pancreas.9 Thus, it is not surprising that ACE-2 overexpression is further explored as a risk factor for COVID-19.10 This potentially places patients with diabetes at additional risk of worsening hyperglycemia in case of a SARS-CoV2 infection, and further supports the clinical evidence that T2DM constitutes a crucial risk factor for rapid deterioration and worse prognosis of COVID-19.11\n",

An important example of such crucial services in the context of diabetes, is the management of patients with acute and severe presentations of diabetes foot disease/ulcers. In the Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications, a relevant paper has been published on the surgical treatment of diabetic foot ulcers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.14 Based on the relevant local experiences and guidelines in China (i.e. the first epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic), Tao et al. describe a \u201cdouble triage, double buffer, and dual mode\u201d model and the process for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers which was followed in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University during the COVID-19 pandemic.14 This proposed strategy for diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers under the emergency conditions posed by the COVID-19 outbreak aims not only to maintain the appropriate and timely care of patients with diabetic foot ulcers, but also mitigate the risks to the safety of involved healthcare professionals and other patients at the treating hospitals.14 Indeed, practical ways of rigorous triage and various levels of buffer wards/zones are essential in order to achieve both these objectives.",

This is also highlighted in another paper published in the Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications by Cushscieri & Greech which outlines how hyperglycemia may have a likely negative impact in the context of COVID-19, including suppression of the antiviral response, pulmonary structure changes and historic evidence of increased viral infection in hyperglycemia.17 Therefore, the proper use of diabetes medications is also essential in managing the risk of COVID-19 to patients with diabetes. Interestingly, the most commonly prescribed medication in diabetes care, i.e. metformin, was in fact initially used as a drug for patients with influenza and malaria,18 and has been postulated to have the potential to not only prevent the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the ACE-2 pathway, but also prevent detrimental sequelae by causing activation of ACE-2 through AMPK-signaling.19\n",

The challenge of doing so should, however, not be underestimated given the high demands required by clinical services and the acutely unwell patients needing care in both our hospitals and communities.",
