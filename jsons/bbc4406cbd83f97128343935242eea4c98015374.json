It takes as input a set of objects (learning set) described with respect to a collection of condition and decision attributes. It generates a set of if-then decision rules. Initial versions of dominance based rough set approximation methods assume a single decision maker. Furthermore, the proposed extensions to group decision making mainly use an input oriented aggregation strategy, which requires a high level of agreement between the decision makers. In this paper, we propose an output oriented aggregation strategy to coherently combine different sets of decision rules obtained from different decision makers. The proposed aggregation algorithm is illustrated by using realworld data relative to a business school admission where two decision makers are involved. Results show that aggregation algorithm is able to reproduce the individual assignments of students with a very limited preferential information loss.",

The DRSA takes a set of assignment examples (learning set) and generates a collection of if-then decision rules as output. The conventional DRSA assumes a single decision maker while several real-world decision problems need to take into account the presence of multiple decision makers. Different group decision making extensions to DRSA have been proposed in the literature, including [1- 6, 8, 11, 12] .",

The aggregation algorithm contains two steps: (i) transformation of overlapping rules, and (ii) elimination of redundant decision rules. We should mention that steps (i) and (ii) may be inverted without affecting the final result. However, in this paper, we maintain the order given above for several reasons. First, the other solution (i.e. proceeding by computing the minimal cover and then transformation of overlapping rules) requires an additional step to compute the minimal cover after the transformation operation. Indeed, the latter may lead to new redundant rules. Second, as a consequence of the first point, the computing time will automatically increase. The only shortcoming of the solution adopted in this paper is that in step (i) both redundant and non-redundant rules are considered. This may have minor effects on the overall computing time.",
