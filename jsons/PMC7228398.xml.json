Culture times were 4 days on human airway epithelial cell lines and 6 days on Vero E6/Huh\u20107 cell lines. The single\u2010stranded RNA was 29 903 bp in length.

SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 exhibits very high sequence similarity to the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses in the receptor\u2010binding domain which indicates pangolins may be an intermediate host of the virus before dissemination to humans.\n8\n SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has weak resistance, 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes, 75% ethanol, chlorine\u2010containing disinfectant, and peracetic acid can inactivate SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n9\n SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010S uses the SARS\u2010coronavirus receptor, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE\u20102) for entry host cells. ACE\u20102 is a surface molecule highly expressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon which indicated digestive system along with respiratory systems is a potential route for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n10\n, \n11\n The expression level of ACE\u20102 in Asian populations is significantly higher than that in European and American populations, and ACE\u20102 on male cells are higher than on female cells, which can partially explain the incidence rate of novel coronavirus pneumonia are higher in male and Asia.\n12\n, \n13\n\n",

The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 rapid spread in children suggests that it has a strong transmission capacity in the special population (neonate, children). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection can range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress in neonates and children. However, Respiratory distress occurs in children with underlying conditions. One patient had severe malnutrition and survived surgery for congenital heart disease, the other had bilateral hydronephrosis and left\u2010kidney calculi. The clinical course of COVID\u201019 was generally milder in children than adults.The most common clinical symptoms of COVID\u201019 included fever, fatigue, and dry cough. A few patients showed upper respiratory symptoms such as nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and sore throat. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may also occur. C\u2010reactive protein was normal or temporary upregulation, ALT levels and myocardial enzyme were not obviously abnormal changes. Chest imaging normalities were present in asymptomatic infected patients. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be mixed to different pathogen including mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and EB virus. The clearance time of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid from nasopharyngeal swab was recorded in three children, 9 days in two patients, 12 days in one patient.\n19\n Thus far, no deaths have been reported in the children which are similar to SARS.\n19\n, \n20\n Three newborns have been diagnosed up to date who mainly belonged to family cluster cases. One 17 days old neonate diagnosed as COVID\u201019 infection had a fever, cough, and vomiting milk. In his family, the housemaid was the earliest case, subsequently, the mother was infected.\n21\n The second newborn appeared fever on 5 days after birth whose mother also confirmed infected. The third one who was born by the infected mother was silent and diagnosed on 30 hours after birth by the viral nucleic acid test. Short breath, vomiting milk, cough, and fever were present in neonates. The vital signs of those neonates were stable, there is no severe emergency case until now.\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n\n",

Treatment mainly depends on adult patients' clinical experience due to few cases in children. There is no specific drug treatment for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 being similar to MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV.\n19\n, \n26\n Symptomatic and supportive treatment is the mainstay of therapy for patients of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection including the supply of oxygen, the maintenance of water\u2010electrolyte, and acid\u2010base balance. The supplement of water and electrolyte should be appropriate, so as to avoid aggravating the pulmonary edema and reduced oxygenation.\n27\n For newborns with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, high\u2010dose pulmonary surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, high\u2010frequency oscillatory ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane lung may be useful. In the United States, patients' conditions were improved apparently after the treatment with nucleoside analog\u2010remdesivir, but there was just one case, the efficacy needs further verification.\n28\n Interferon\u2010\u03b12b nebulization were be applied in MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV, so it could be considered to use in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n29\n, \n30\n In addition, three potential drug combinations (sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) are candidate repurposable drugs.\n31\n Moreover, convalescent sera from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010recovered patients may be useful for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, because of a significant reduction in the mortality following convalescent sera from SARS\u2010recovered patients treatment.\n32\n\n",
