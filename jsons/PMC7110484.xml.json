Local outbreaks usually start in the summer following the importation of dengue virus (DENV) strains, reach a peak in October and November, and then slow down and cease in the winter of each year. Therefore, dengue is listed as a quarantine agent at the international airports in Taiwan, and in 2003 active surveillance for dengue was integrated into the airport fever screening program to reduce the importation of DENV strains. An empirical investigation into the impact of this intervention has not been carried out to date. In this study, we evaluated the effect of this intervention on community transmission. The findings of this study will contribute towards our understanding of dengue epidemics in Taiwan and this information may be applied in other epidemic areas to develop effective control measures in the future.",

            "text": "In 2003, Taiwan introduced airport fever screening using non-contact infrared thermometers (NCIT) at international airports. This surveillance system successfully identified 45% (244/542; 95% confidence interval 33.1\u201357.8%) of imported dengue cases during 1998\u20132007 (Table 1). The efficacy of airport thermal screening for detecting DENV infection was tested and the derived positive predictive value (PPV) varied from 30.5% to 62.6% (Table 1). However, results from two-way ANOVA indicated that there was no significant difference between the fluctuating numbers of imported cases and indigenous cases (F\n = 0.15 < 4.49, p\n = 0.71; F\n = 2.64 < 4.49, p\n = 0.12), or the interaction effect (F\n = 0.26, p\n = 0.62) between them, i.e., the impact of imported cases on the annual trends of indigenous cases with or without airport fever screening. Throughout the island of Taiwan, the number of indigenous dengue cases and imported dengue cases also exhibited very little association (\u22120.2 < \nR\nID\u2013IP\n < 0.3), even in the epidemic years of 2002, 2006, and 2007 (R\nID\u2013IP\n = \u22120.035, 0.002, and 0.2, respectively). Nevertheless, in view of the geographical heterogeneity, the association of imported cases with indigenous cases (R\nID\u2013IP\n = 0.08\u20130.95 by Pearson) was relatively higher in 2003\u20132007 in southern Taiwan after airport fever screening had been implemented, than in 1998\u20132001 (R\nID\u2013IP\n = \u22120.54\u20130.89) prior to airport fever screening (Figure 3\n). Furthermore, the imported dengue cases detected by airport fever screening may provide a guide to the total number of imported dengue cases; during 2003\u20132007, the total number of imported cases = 3.459 + 0.418 \u00d7 number of imported cases detected by fever screening (n\n = 5, R\n = 0.90, R\n2\n = 0.80, p\n < 0.05). Considering the geographical heterogeneity, the number of imported dengue cases was positively associated with indigenous cases in a linear regression manner; during 2003\u20132007, in which airport fever screening had been implemented, the number of indigenous cases = \u2212169.283 + 53.398 \u00d7 number of imported cases (n\n = 25, R\n = 0.78, R\n2\n = 0.61, y\n = 53.40x\n \u2212 169.28). This association was lower (n\n = 25, R\n = 0.13, R\n2\n = 0.02) during 1998\u20132002, prior to the implementation of airport fever screening in southern Taiwan (Figure 3).",

            "text": "By analyzing the dengue case database recorded by the Taiwan CDC surveillance system, trends in seasonality and geographical distribution were clearly exhibited. Dengue outbreaks were mainly clustered in southern (tropical) Taiwan, especially in the metropolitan areas. The heterogeneity of dengue incidence in time and geography might be attributed to the complexity of risk factors involved in the disease in Taiwan, including the interaction of ecological factors, such as mosquito vectors, human density, and climate. The mosquito vectors Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti coexist in tropical southern Taiwan. The multi-meal feeding vector, A. aegypti, is the main vector, often found among humans in urban dwellings.[5], [6] For example, the distribution of A. aegypti in densely populated Kaohsiung City was found to be wider than A. albopictus and appeared to be increasing, whereas this was not found in the nearby counties.11 Also, a significant correlation was found between the number of dengue cases per week and the adult A. aegypti index obtained 5 weeks before the disease occurred, whereas no correlation was found between the number of cases and the adult A. albopictus index in the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas during 2004\u20132008.11 In subtropical northern Taiwan, however, only A. albopictus has been found and only sporadic dengue cases have been recorded during the past decade. The weather in tropical Taiwan, with heavy rain, lasting high temperatures averaging 28 \u00b0C, and a moist environment (50\u201355% relative humidity), has been considered optimal for mosquitoes seeking their hosts,[12], [15] leading to DENV replication.[12], [13], [14] However, in winter, dry conditions, relatively low temperatures averaging 20 \u00b0C, and occasional drops in temperature to 10\u201318 \u00b0C, could be a bottleneck for virus survival, amplification, and transmission.[16], [17] In northern Taiwan with a subtropical climate, the rainfall is moderate and temperatures are relatively mild.[4], [5] We observed that the dominant DENV abated each winter (December to February) even in tropical Taiwan, with diverse serotypes causing subsequent epidemics in following years (Table 1). This annual diversity in the dominant serotype and data from phylogenetic studies[7], [9], [10] indicate that dengue is not endemic in Taiwan.",

Wu et al.5 proposed that the utilization of incidence rates to assess the occurrence of dengue infections gave limited results. In this study, we assessed the dengue incidence rate based on the number of cases divided by the stratified population of each separate region, instead of dividing by the total population. This provided meaningful differences between subtropical and tropical zone regions in epidemic years, but the results were rather meaningless in non-epidemic years or other areas (Table 1).",

However, airport fever screening followed by laboratory confirmation by real-time RT-PCR8 successfully identified approximately half, 45% (244/542), of imported dengue cases in the viremic stages on days 1\u20135 after onset of illness. Our results also indirectly demonstrate that about 55.0% (298/542) of imported cases were temporary, non-febrile, i.e., latent cases, undetected by airport fever screening, entering Taiwan with some risk of community transmission. We agree with the findings of a previous report17 that 50\u201390% of dengue infection cases are asymptomatic, and therefore transmission of DENV into Taiwan via incoming travelers may be inevitable. Nevertheless, our findings that the total number of imported cases = 3.459 + 0.418 \u00d7 number of imported cases detected by fever screening (R\n2\n = 0.80, p\n < 0.05), and that the geographical heterogeneity was the number of indigenous cases \u2212169.283 + 53.398 \u00d7 number of imported cases (R\n2\n = 0.61) during 2003\u20132007 when airport fever screening had been implemented, indicate that border screening might provide a guide to the total number of dengue imported cases and indirectly alert authorities of possible domestic outbreaks in southern Taiwan. The immediate quarantine of infectious cases could also help to block partial domestic transmission, reducing the risk to the population and the need for subsequent intervention, including vector control and medical care for patients. The efficacy of screening symptomatic passengers passing through Taiwan airports by NCIT was found to have a PPV = 30.5\u201362.6% when fever prevalence among passengers was <1%; this is similar to a previous report.[8], [18] However, the effect on mitigating community transmission in dengue epidemics was not significantly different between pre-2003 border control methods (filling out questionnaires) and post-2003 methods (fever screening). This limitation was attributed to latent dengue cases, resulting from asymptomatic infection and possibly other factors, such as passengers hiding their symptoms.[8], [18] All of these factors that could impair airport screening strategies should be considered when setting up border control measures to delay the pandemic progression of DENV.",
