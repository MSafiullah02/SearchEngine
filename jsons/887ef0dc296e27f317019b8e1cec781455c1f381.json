In most cases, live vaccines are prepared with attenuated strains of the respective virus and therefore, these viruses replicate in the tissues of the respiratory tract, inducing a reaction that is known as postvaccination reaction. The degree of this reaction varies from very mild to severe, depending on factors such as degree of attenuation, concentration, route, and age of administration of the vaccine virus. Severe postvaccination reactions are observed when environmental factors or secondary infections with other microorganisms occur, resulting in what is commonly known as complicated postvaccination or respiratory reactions. The vaccine viruses most frequently involved in these type of reactions are the IBV and NDV viruses, probably because these two viruses are commonly used in vaccination programs throughout the world.",

            "text": "The Coronavirus IBV constitutes one of the most important viruses in poultry medicine because of its numerous serotypes that have been described (Hopkins, 1974; Johnson and Marquardt, 1975) . The Massachusetts (Mass) strain of IBV is considered to be the prototype strain for the group and is the representative of the Mass serotype. Viruses or strains that differ from the Mass strain are known as serotypes, and have been described in numerous countries of the world. Variant strains, or isolates that differ from the common serotypes, have also been described (Gelb et al., 1991) . Numerous descriptions of viruses that differ from the common IBV serotypes have appeared in the recent literature. In Australia, two genotypically distinct groups of strains have been described, some of them exhibiting nephropathogenicity (Sapats et al., 1996) . In Japan, IBV strains with additional tropism for tissues other than the respiratory tract have been described (Otsuki et al., 1990; Animas et al., 1994) . In Hungary, nephrotropic strains were identified as different from the Mass 41 and H52 strains (Tarcha et al., 1990) . French workers described the IBV strain PL 84084 as a variant strain (Bonnefoy et al., 1993) . Strain 624/I isolated in Italy was described as being distinct from several European and American strains (Capua et al., 1994) . Several variant serotypes isolated from commercial layers and broilers were described by Gelb et al. (1991) in the U.S. Enterotropic strains of infectious bronchitis virus have also been reported in the U.S. (Karaka et al., 1990; Lucio and Fabricant, 1990) , and in England (Ambali and Jones, 1990; Ambali, 1992) .",

To control the condition, vaccines of chicken embryo origin as well as cell culture have been used with limited success. The recommended application route of these vaccines is the intraocular procedure, a method clearly inappropriate for the broiler industry. Several applications via the drinking water have given mixed results in broilers, where postvaccination reactions have been observed as well as a decrease in the production parameters in the vaccinated flocks. When outbreaks are present, new vaccines should be tested for use in broilers. In Japan, a cell-associated vaccine has been developed for injection at 1 d of age (Taneno et al., 1990 (Taneno et al., , 1991 Honda et al., 1994) . The authors reported satisfactory results in broilers.

            "text": "Sporadic outbreaks of avian influenza were reported in several countries (O. I. E. Bulletin, 1996) . In general, the highly pathogenic form of the disease is easily diagnosed mainly because of the high mortality and typical lesions observed. However, the disease caused by the low pathogenic strains is not always easily recognized, and the virus can rapidly spread to other susceptible poultry populations. Also, low pathogenic strains can become highly pathogenic, as it has already been observed in outbreaks in the USA in 1983, and in Mexico in 1994.",
