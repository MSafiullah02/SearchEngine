However, the serum of all sampled animals, except for the sick new-borns, was positive for RV antibodies, including the adult guanacos (45 of 45) ( Table 1 ). The high antibody prevalence detected in both farms (95%) adds evidence indicating that guanacos, as observed in previous studies of other South American camelids, such as Lama pacos (Rivera et al., 1987) and Lama glama (Puntel et al. 1999 ) are susceptible to rotavirus infection. Further serologic analysis indicate that RV antibody titres in convalescent animals in farm A ranged from 64 to 4096 [geometric mean titre (GMT) 637], whereas in farm B, they ranged from 256 to 16 384 (GMT 1326).

The present data suggests an absence of adequate levels of passive protection that may be associated with the high mortality observed after the diarrhoea outbreak.
