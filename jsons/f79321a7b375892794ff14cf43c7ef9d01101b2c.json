A key step in the establishment of infectious disease is microbial virulence, which has been described as an emergent property of host-microbe interaction [ 1 ] . At the molecular level, entities like proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids enable the pathogens to establish themselves in a susceptible host. These molecules form inherent part of the pathogen cellular system and are collectively termed \"virulence factors\" [ 2 , 3 ] . Virulence factors in various pathogens play diverse roles in the establishment of disease. These include colonization of the host, evasion of host defense mechanisms, immunosuppression, acquisition of nutrients from host cell, mediation of entry and exit into host cell in intracellular pathogens, and sensing change of environment [ 4 , 5 ] .

However, this approach would lead to large number of false positives as not all proteins possessing transmembrane domains are adhesins. 5. Domain Search: Domains are conserved autonomously folding functional unit of a protein [ 34 ]. The domains of a protein together defi ne the function of the protein. The domain information of an unannotated protein sequence can be used to predict its function ( see Note 4 ). Some adhesin domains are known.
