Like previous epidemic and pandemic diseases, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza posed an increased risk of severe illness among pregnant women [2-9]. A report from the first month of the pH1N1 outbreak noted that the rate of hospitalization among pregnant women was approximately four times the rate in the general population in the USA [3]. As reported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), a total of 10% of the 1088 patients who were hospitalized or died from the 2009 pH1N1 influenza were pregnant [10]. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the People's Republic of China, pregnant women accounted for 13.7% of deaths associated with 2009 pH1N1 influenza [11]. Pregnant women with influenza appear to have an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth and stillbirth [2,12,13]. Reports from Victoria in Australia [14,15], New York [16], and California [17], demonstrate that 2009 pH1N1 infection was associated with substantial maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. However, information is limited concerning the risk factors for maternal and neonatal death when pregnancy is complicated by severe or critical illness related to 2009 pH1N1 influenza.",

A confirmed case was a person whose pH1N1 virus infection was verified by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with or without the presentation of other clinical symptoms. Patients were excluded if they had been treated as outpatients or in emergency rooms or duration of hospitalization < 24 h, or if they had incomplete records of clinical outcomes. Severe and critical cases were defined according to the H1N1 2009 Clinical guidelines (Third Edition, 2009) released by the MOH (Additional file 1: Table S1). Our research retrospectively collected the patient's clinical information and did not involve the patient's personal information and samples, so there was no informed consent.",

Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using height and weight recorded in the case report form, patients with BMI \u2265 30 were categorized as obesity. Indications for applying non-invasive ventilation (NIV): pregnant women who complained shortness of breath or blood gas analysis confirmed hypoxemia PaO2 to FiO2 < 300. One non-pulmonary major organ dysfunction or unconsciousness was contraindications for NIV. Indications to change from NIV to invasive ventilation: A cautious trial of NIV was attempted and response to NIV was monitored after the first hour or two. If there was a deterioration of oxygenation, invasive ventilation was considered. Definition of successful NIV: PaO2 to FiO2 improved and respiratory rate decreased during one or two hour NIV therapy. The patients successfully weaned off NIV and survived. Definition of failed NIV: During the one or two NIV trial, a deterioration of oxygenation was observed and invasive ventilation was needed. Data collection and analysis were coordinated by the MOH. A standard data collection form was used for each study site. Site investigators were primarily infectious disease physicians closely involved in taking care of such patients at their centers. The data were entered in duplicate into a computerized database. Patient confidentiality was maintained by recording only patient date of birth and gender on the data collection form. The research ethics board at Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital and The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University approved the study.",

For categorical variables, percentages of patients in each category were calculated. We compared clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes by using an ANOVA test, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test as necessary. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We performed univariable logistic analysis to investigate the potential factors on admission that might be associated with the maternal mortality. Factors with statistical significance (p < 0.05) in the univariate analyses were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All analysis was carried out using SPSS for Windows (release 13.0).",
