Facing unprecedented risks in the markets, people have increasing needs to find a safe haven for their investments. Given that the nature of this crisis is a combination of multiple problems, it is substantially different from all other financial crises known to us. It is therefore urgent to re-evaluate the safe-haven role of some traditional asset types, namely, gold, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange and commodities. This paper introduces a sequential monitoring procedure to detect changes in the left-quantiles of asset returns, and to assess whether a tail change in the equity index can be offset by introducing a safe-haven asset into a simple mean-variance portfolio. The sample studied covers a training period between August-December 2019 and a testing period of December 2019-March 2020. Furthermore, we calculate the cross-quantilogram between pair-wise asset returns and compare their directional predictability on left-quantiles in both normal market conditions and the COVID-19 period. The main results show that the role of safe haven becomes less effective for most of the assets considered in this paper, while gold and soybean commodity futures remain robust as safe-haven assets during this pandemic.",

The outbreak of COVID-19 has been considered a \"once-in-a-century\" pandemic (Gates, 2020) . To contain this extremely contagious virus, countries across the world have implemented extensive measures, including the lockdown of cities and the closing of borders, which has caused a temporary economic suspension in many places. In 2003, the severe acute J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f respiratory syndrome, better known as SARS , was estimated to cost the world between $30-100 billion (Smith, 2006) . A much larger impact on the global economy is expected from the COVID-19 outbreak. Fernandes (2020) , for example, estimated that the outbreak could cause a median economic slowdown of 2.8%, while the extreme case, such as Spain, could fall by more than 15%. With the great uncertainty on when the virus might be fully contained, financial markets are expected to see more troubles and many related issues call for further investigation (Goodwell, 2020) . Facing great losses, the need to search for safe-haven assets has resurfaced for both practitioners and researchers.",

A major perception is that safe-haven assets are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with other assets or portfolios during times of market turmoil (Baur and Lucey, 2010; Shahzad et al., 2020) . This definition makes sense as safe haven-assets can help investors build a portfolio that mitigates the downside market risk. From an econometric modeling point of view, we thereby need to assess the dependence between assets on left-quantiles of the return distribution. However, many of the conventional methods hardly deliver precise results simply because the task is timely demanding and sufficient observations are not available. This challenge can be addressed, however, if we only focus on the stability of left-quantiles from safe-haven assets. The idea is that the tail-quantiles should maintain a stable level for an effective safe-haven asset during the market stress period. If a safe-haven asset experiences a tail change like other assets experience, it is more likely to correlate with those assets and will lose its effectiveness.",

We use a sequential surveillance test to monitor the stability of the tail behaviour of potential safe-have assets. Moreover, taking the idea that practitioners hope to use safe-haven assets to offset market risk, we construct mean-variance optimised portfolios between equity indices and safe-haven assets, and we test the tail behavior of portfolio returns during the COVID-19 period. As a robustness check, we also apply the cross-quantilogram method to identify the safe-haven property toward equity indices for each asset in both a normal market and a market during turbulent phases.

For example, Baur and McDermott (2010) use 30 years of data from major emerging and developing countries to test the safe-haven asset hypothesis of gold. They confirm this property of gold for the US and major European stock markets but not for other markets. Reboredo (2013) finds that gold can have both the role of a hedge and an effective safe haven. Similar results are found also in Beckmann et al. (2015) . Meanwhile, Hood and Malik (2013) suggest that gold is a hedge for the US stock market, but its role as a safe haven is weak relative to the volatility index (VIX). Lucey and Li (2014) study the role of precious metals as safe havens in a time-varying framework and they find the strength of gold being a safe haven changes over time. extend their earlier study (Lucey and Li, 2014) to eleven countries.

Crisse and Nitschka (2015) add further evidence that the Swiss franc exchange rate can act as a safe-haven currency in some cases. Shahzad et al. (2019b) show that the commodity index is a weak safe haven for some stock indices. For other commodities, Creti et al. (2013) include oil, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coffee and cocoa together with gold to examine their links with stocks between 2001 and 2011. Gold is found to have the safe-haven properties, whereas other commodities' correlation with stock prices changes according to market conditions. The role of commodities in hedging and as safe-haven assets are affected by the recent trend of financialization (Zhang, 2017; Zhang and Broadstock, 2018; Bouri et al., 2020) . In other words, commodities such as crude oil (Xia et al., 2019) and food commodities (e.g., soybeans) behave quite differently since the 2008 global financial crisis (Wu et al., 2020) . Their role as safe-haven assets related to the current health crisis is therefore worthy of further exploration. In general, what can be considered safe-haven assets remains a controversial topic. Even with gold, the most popular candidate, its role as a safe haven is not entirely secure.",

The effectiveness of a safe-haven asset is subject to the particular asset class or market studied. Second, safe-haven property may change over time or depend on the fundamental characteristics of the market turmoil. In this sense, we would expect that safe-haven assets under the COVID-19 pandemic are different from those in the 2008 global financial crisis. Third, the controversies in the current literature may be due to the methodology used. For example, the DCC approach only looks at correlations and do not allow for asymmetric responses. In terms of risk management in financial markets, it is often important to look at the tails of return distribution (Shahzad et al., 2019b) .",

In addition, Baur and Lucey (2010) and Shahzad et al.

Detecting changes in the quantile regression was studied by Qu (2008) as well as Oka and Qu (2011) . However, their methods are not applicable in the current context because limited observations could be made from the period studied. Particularly, our focus is on studying asset behaviour during the global outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, i.e., at the end of the sample. This renders many conventional econometric methods impotent. We, therefore, apply a sequential surveillance test (Hoga and Wied, 2017) to monitor the tail behaviour of the return series. The sequential test accords more with the current situation as its statistics can J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f converge to an asymptotic limit with less data so that the test successfully detects a tail change in a responsible period with the help of real-time observations. More importantly, to add more practical values, along with time-series observations during the pandemic, the results are easy to update.",

Recall that / = 0.2 kn , this leads to the surveillance procedure beginning from 25 December 2019, as a fraction of the testing sample is used for preparation. The detector n W \uf074 is then computed day by day in the testing sample, but the detection stops once there is the detector that exceeds the threshold \uf074 . Figure 2 illustrates the sequential surveillance procedure for each of the assets, as well as the VaR estimators. Combined with the last column in Table 2 , the results show that the equity indices in all three markets suffer from a tail change in March 2020. In particular, note that major market indices in the US fell more than 7% on March 9. Another remarkable case is the crude oil commodity future that experiences a tail change on March 18. This comes with a collapse of oil price, which dropped by 24% and was recorded as one of the worst days in the history. This partially explains why a breakdown found in the VaR estimation for the corresponding assets. On the other hand, four safe-haven candidates (bitcoin, gold, CNY-USD exchange rate, and soybean commodity futures), do not incur a tail change over the testing period (for a robustness checking, we also perform detections when = 0.10 \uf074 , 0.15, 0.20 , and obtain similar results).

Figure 4 shows example plots of the time varying cross-quantilogram between equity indices and bitcoin, for the solid blue and dot red lines standing for time varying cross-quantilogram and bootstrapped 95% confidence interval, respectively. The vertical green lines indicate that bitcoin can be used as a strong version of safe-haven asset for that particular window, which is evidenced by the blue line across the lower bound of red lines. From the plots we observe that the role of bitcoin, as a potential safe-haven asset to equity indices, becomes less effective during the pandemic period.

Nonetheless, a few exceptions can be seen for bitcoin, gold and soybean commodity futures paired with MSCI-CN, CNY-USD paired with MSCI-US and MSCI-EU. In addition, we also need to note that the worst scenarios of this crisis happened in the very end of COVID-19 sample, which may further change the role of safe-haven assets.",

Figure 5 illustrates the results of cross-quantilograms, in which the green color on the heatmap represents negative lead-lag effect, meaning the candidate asset can be considered as a strong safe-haven asset. Red color represents a positive spillover effect between equity indices and candidate asset, while yellow color stands for no predictability on their left-quantiles, i.e., a weak version of safe-haven asset. An independence test is performed to test the significance of the cross-quantilogram under the stationary bootstrapping procedure (see Equation 3 ). We therefore assign a zero value to the cross-quantilogram if the null or no predictability cannot be rejected.",

Second, the rest of the safe haven candidates (gold, EUR-USD, and the soybean commodity futures) either keep the same status of being safe-haven assets, or they act as a better safe-haven during the COVID-19 sample. And the third, with no conflict with the first two points, the directional predictive patterns between asset candidates and equity indices are quite similar in US and EU market, and patterns regarding China are slightly different in some cases, for example, there are positive spillover effects between MSCI-CN and gold and soybean in the training sample.

Using data from August 2019 to December 2019 as a training period for the model, and then taking the outbreak between December 2019 and March 2020 as the testing period, our empirical results suggest that gold and soybean commodity futures can be used as safe-haven assets during the outbreak of COVID-19.

The strong and robust role of soybean futures is slightly surprising as it is not normally considered a strong candidate. The logic behind this once again links to the nature of the current crisis. The financial turmoil is essentially driven by the health crisis. By implementing measures to contain the virus, both the industrial and consumer sector are affected, leading to an over-supply of crude oil and also ruling out its relevance as a safe-haven asset. The locking down of cities and borders also affect international trade, and thus put the foreign exchange market into great uncertainty. The crisis, however, raises the need for agricultural products. Food security, for example, has become a major issue for many countries (e.g., Deaton and Deaton, 2020) , which makes agricultural commodities a strong hold under the current crisis. Our findings are also in line with the literature that safe-haven assets can change over time and across countries. In addition, when searching for safe-haven assets, investors cannot ignore the underlying characteristics/driving forces of the market turmoil.",
