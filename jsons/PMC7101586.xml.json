This rising incidence has been attributed to several risk factors that are prevalent in critically ill patients, such as debility, underlying malignancy, blood and marrow transplantation, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), prolonged ICU and hospital stay, neutropenia, use of antibiotics and corticosteroids, and administration of parenteral alimentation [4\u201310]. In most cases, the yeast\u2019s portal of entry is the gut, yet in other patients, especially those with central venous catheters (CVCs), skin is the most likely culprit [11, 12].",

In immunocompetent patients, Candida esophagitis is quite rare and is associated with certain predisposing factors, such as use of H2-receptor antagonists, antacids, prior vagotomy producing hypochlorydria, administration of antibiotics and systemic or inhaled corticosteroids, functional or mechanical obstruction of the esophagus, malnutrition, metabolic disorders, and alcoholism [14\u201316].

The study protocol was approved by the hospital\u2019s ethics committee. Because of the patients\u2019 inability to give informed consent for participation in the study, consent was obtained from their next of kin. Eligible for participation in the study were patients who had been hospitalized for >48 h and had developed candidemia during their ICU stay. Blood cultures were ordered at the discretion of the attending physicians, when clinically indicated. Patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelets <60,000/\u03bcl) or coagulopathy were excluded because our study included a biopsy procedure. Patients receiving or who had received prior antifungal therapy the last month before the ICU admission and patients with a confirmed systemic fungal infection prior to the diagnosis of candidemia also were excluded because the focus of the study was to be a population with ICU-acquired canidemia.",

Patients who received systemic corticosteroids for ICU indications, such as sepsis or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), after their ICU admission were classified in the NIC group.

Candida colonization as a risk factor is still controversial. It has been studied as a predictor of invasive candidiasis in the ICU setting; in fact, a \u201ccolonization index\u201d has been proposed to predict invasive candidiasis in ICU patients, although guidelines for identifying patients who would best benefit from antifungal prophylaxis are not established [23, 24].

The development of Candida esophagitis is a two-step process that includes colonization of the esophagus and invasion of the epithelial layer. When the intraluminal concentration of Candida spp. is high, the fungus is able to transmigrate the wall of the digestive tract and gain access to the circulation, a process known as persorption [25]. In NIC patients, this process, although rare, has been associated with certain predisposing factors and as-yet-unknown mechanisms of infection [25]. The NIC patients in our study developed candidemia during their ICU hospitalization, and none manifested esophageal candidiasis, although one developed oral thrush. Our autopsy findings, which showed that six NIC patients had no organ involvement, suggest that candidemia probably resulted from transient fungal translocation across the gastrointestinal tract without affecting the mucosal membranes. However, we performed autopsies in only 40% of the NIC patients.",

In our study, the simultaneous diagnosis of oral thrush and a stool culture positive for Candida spp. in IC patients was associated with a 67% specificity and a positive predictive value for development of esophageal candidiasis. The lack of correlation between candidemia/systemic candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis in NIC in comparison to IC patients can likely be explained by the defective primary defense mechanisms against tissue invasion and dissemination that are common in IC patients. We would like to emphasize that oral candidiasis that presents as erythematous candidiasis (in the absence of other specific symptoms and signs) could be difficult to diagnose in critically ill patients and might be occasionally misleading because (a) tubes and other devices placed in the oral cavity are themselves able to produce mild inflammatory lesions, and (b) the increased respiratory secretions and, often, the regurgitated enteral nutrition content may cause inflammation of the oral mucosa.",

Total parenteral nutrition has been a known risk factor for BSI due to Candida spp., and its use has recently been associated with candidemia due to C. parapsilosis in both children and adults [29, 30]. Interestingly, candidemia due to C. parapsilosis in non-neutropenic patients with an intravenous hyperalimentation catheter has a low mortality rate and a good prognosis [30]. In our study, C. parapsilosis was isolated from the blood cultures of two patients, one NIC and one IC, making it the third most common Candida sp. encountered, after C. albicans (15 blood isolates total; 10 in NIC patients) and C. tropicalis (3 blood isolates, all in NIC patients). The NIC patient with C. parapsilosis candidemia in our series had Charcot disease complicated by pneumonia, but she survived. The other patient with C. parapsilosis candidemia had AIDS and succumbed to his disease. The higher Apache II scores in our IC patients are suggestive of an increased severity of the underlying critical illness. Lower (<21 points) Apache II scores have been associated with a higher probability of survival in a multicenter study of non-neutropenic critically ill patients with candidemia [31], and higher Apache III scores have been associated with increased mortality in cancer patients with candidemia in a study of 479 episodes at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center [32].",

First, we were unable to pinpoint the exact time of onset of the esophageal candidiasis, especially since oral thrush was already present before admission to the ICU. Due to obvious ethical reasons, we evaluated our patients for esophageal candidiasis with endoscopy only once. Thus, we do not know if the esophagus was involved before or after the ICU admission. Second, it is unclear if the esophageal candidiasis resulted from hematogenous spread of the fungi in the esophagus, or if the bloodstream involvement was directly related to the oral thrush or the esophageal candidiasis. Third, we did not focus on the treatment administered to patients with candidemia, although we did report that patients with C. albicans and non-albicans candidemia received fluconazole and liposomal amphotericin B intravenously, respectively. Fourth, we do not have readily available data on the length of stay of all patients who received care in the ICU or the total number of cases of candidemia in the ICU, including those excluded, to know how common candidemia is among ICU patients. Fifth, there are no readily available data regarding the type of therapy and the removal of CVCs and the influence of either factor on outcome in the two patient groups studied. Sixth, the sample of our study population is relatively small (study population from a single center) and thus does not permit a powerful statistical analysis; unfortunately, various practical reasons prevented us from incorporating data from other large ICUs into our study. Finally, we do not have readily available data on MICs because the laboratory usually reported the results for an isolate as either \u201csusceptible\u201d or \u201cnot susceptible\u201d to fluconazole.",
