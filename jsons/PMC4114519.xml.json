Patients in the present analyses enrolled in ACTG 384 in 1998 and 1999 in the USA and received ddI/d4T-containing regimens. Cases were patients who developed clinical signs or symptoms of distal sensory neuropathy within the first 96 weeks of initiating ddI/d4T. Controls were patients who did not develop such signs or symptoms within 96 weeks of initiating ddI/d4T. Patients with peripheral neuropathy documented prior to initiating ddI/d4T were excluded from these analyses. Peripheral neuropathy was assessed at each study visit and was categorized as grade 1 (asymptomatic with sensory alteration on exam or minimal paresthesia causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional activities), grade 2 (sensory alteration or paresthesia causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and functional activities), and grade 3 (sensory alteration or paresthesia causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities).",

Meta-analysis of grade 3 peripheral neuropathy showed the lowest P value for a polymorphism near KIF1B. In White patients, the polymorphism with the lowest P value for association with all grades of peripheral neuropathy and with grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was in KIF1A, while in Black patients, the lowest P values were for polymorphisms in LITAF. KIF1A encodes a protein involved in anterograde transport of organelles along axonal microtubules, and KIF1A mutations have been associated with spastic paraplegia and hereditary sensory neuropathy (Klebe et al. 2012; Riviere et al. 2011), while KIF1B encodes for a protein involved in apoptosis and axonal transport of membranous organelles. Mutations to KIF family genes have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A, while LITAF mutations have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C (CMT1C) (Street et al. 2003). In Hispanic patients, the polymorphism with the lowest P value for association with all grades of peripheral neuropathy was in NEFL, which encodes the neurofilament light polypeptide. Mutations in NEFL have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease types 2E and 1F (Jordanova et al. 2003; Shin et al. 2008)",
