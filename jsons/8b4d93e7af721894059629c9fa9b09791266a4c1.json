No effective vaccine or drugs are available, which makes it very challenging to treat or prevent the deadly COVID-19.

In the air, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be present as droplets, or as dust, or particulate matter (PM). The decay of the virus under various environmental conditions would determine the survival of the virus. These conditions may include the size of particulate matter and aerosols, humidity and temperature. These suggest the potential role of climate change on occurrence and the fate of the virus. Environmental chemistry research on the fate of pollutants in air (Kfoury et al. 2016; Yu 2019; Gopinath and Kadirvelu 2018) , water (Gopinath and Kadirvelu 2018; Mahmood et al. 2012; Rodgers et al. 2019; Wen et al. 2019 ) and wastewater (Padervand et al. 2020; Simas et al. 2019; Villase\u00f1or and R\u00edos 2018; is therefore highly relevant to the study of pathogenic microbes. Future detailed investigations about the physiochemical role of environmental parameters of air might therefore address the control of future outbreaks or pandemics with greater efficiency.",

For example, the novel coronavirus may survive for prolonged periods on surfaces such as latex gloves, sterile sponges, aluminum, wood, laminate, steel and plastics. Viruses usually have longer survival in a host and thus may have increased likelihood of transmission. Similarly, complete information is essential on how the novel coronavirus interacts with surfaces on a mask that vary in composition, material and pore size to understand survival and protection. Systematically designed experiments will help us gain insight into the virus survival on various surfaces, thus minimizing the exposure of the novel coronavirus to the humans. Here, recent research in environmental chemistry has shown the role of surface materials on antimicrobial resistance (Khan et al. 2019 ) and bacterial communities (Dong et al. 2019) .",

During wastewater treatment, oxidants and disinfectants can inactivate enveloped viruses (Manoli et al. 2020 ). However, many poor communities lack the infrastructure to provide clean water, and therefore would face exposure of infectious viruses. Additionally, faulty plumbing in buildings may increase exposure to the viruses. Very limited data sets are available on human viruses in the literature. Research on enveloped-virus transmission and on the treatment of wastewater must include a wide range of enveloped viruses. Here, environmental chemists have developed a wide array of wastewater treatment techniques Bello and Raman 2019; Lichtfouse et al. 2019; Bouabidi et al. 2019; Bourgeois et al. 2015) , which deserve further testing for virus inactivation.",
