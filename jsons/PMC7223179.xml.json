More than 40% patients in intensive care units (ICU) require MV as a part of their process of care [1]. Clinicians in ICU are often challenged with the decisions regarding when and how to wean critically ill patients from MV. Weaning from MV is initiated as early as possible to avoid the complications associated with prolonged ventilation, such as ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). However, clinicians have to balance the benefits of early extubation with the risk of failure extubation and reintubation, while reintubation increases risk of hospital acquired pneumonia by 8 times, death by 6\u201312 times [2].",

The diaphragm, as the major respiratory muscle, is responsible for approximately 60\u201380% of the workload [3]. As a result, the diaphragmatic function plays a critical role in weaning from MV. Consequently, the thinning diaphragm, descending movement, and impaired contractility easily develop VIDD in patients with COPD due to systemic inflammatory response, oxidative stress, malnutrition, and chronic hypoxia [4]. In fact, the previous studies have demonstrated a majority of mechanically ventilated patients spent a staggering 40% of the time devoted to weaning from MV in the ICU, 60% for COPD [5\u20137]. In general, the evaluation of diaphragmatic function was common in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU. Several traditional variables for evaluating diaphragmatic function have been used in clinical practice, such as maximum inspiratory, expiratory pressure, and maximum trans-diaphragmatic pressure. But these variables presented some limitations that were invasive and dependent greatly on patient\u2019s cooperation, which make them to be put into difficult practice in the ICU. Other methods of assessing diaphragmatic function showed also disadvantages, like radiolesion, movement artifacts, and non-continuity, as in the case of chest X-rays, or were difficult to be carried out at the bedside, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging [8].",

Along with the growing use of ultrasonography in the ICU in recent years, it could be used to observe the morphology of the diaphragm, thus to evaluate diaphragmatic function and spontaneous breathing ability [9\u201311]. The previous studies have showed that the DE measured by ultrasound could be used to assess respiratory effort, and while diaphragmatic thickening fraction was shown to be correlated strongly with diaphragm strength and ventilator support level, the right DE assessed by ultrasound was more reliable, more feasible, and more repeatable [12\u201318]. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore the value of the right DE and its variation assessed by ultrasound in predicting extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated patients with COPD.",

During the SBT, diaphragmatic movement was examined and recorded by the ultrasound physician (all images of ultrasound were saved, and measurements were repeated again.). In the whole process of SBT, infusion speed of drugs and other treatment remained unchanged. The patient was monitored by the ECG monitor to record the changes of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiration rate (RR), and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2), and to observe the change of mental status. The patients were divided into successful extubation group and failure extubation group according to extubation outcome. General information and various weaning parameters of patients were collected prospectively, such as fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The efficacy (sensitivity, specificity, etc.) of DE and its changes assessed by ultrasound in predicting extubation outcome were calculated and compared.

MV for 6\u201312 h can result in significant diaphragmatic atrophy or diaphragmatic dysfunction, as showed by animal studies [24, 25]. Therefore, diaphragmatic dysfunction can interact with MV, and it is time-dependent increase in diaphragmatic dysfunction in patients with the increase of MV time [26, 27]. Diaphragmatic dysfunction has a relatively higher incidence in patients with COPD undergoing MV [28]. Consequently, the prompt and accurate evaluation of the diaphragmatic function is crucial to successful weaning from MV in patients with COPD. SBT has been usually employed to predict extubation outcome. Even if patients passed SBT, the rate of failure extubation could still reach approximately 25% [11, 29, 30]. As a result, it will be very valuable to seek an easily available and accurate indicator to predict extubation outcome and improve survival rate of patients in the ICU.",

However, recent studies shown that DE was closely correlated with the first second exhalation, lung volume, residual volume, minute ventilation, and maximum inspiratory volume [14, 31]. Moreover, DE correlated well with trans-diaphragmatic pressure [15]. DE assessed by ultrasound was more accurate than diaphragm-thickening fraction in predicting successful weaning from MV [16]. Accordingly, DE assessed by ultrasound could evaluate well-diaphragmatic function. In addition, the right DE was usually easier to be observed, while the descending lung, bowel, and gas on the left side often interfered with the evaluation of diaphragmatic function during inspiration. Furthermore, descending diaphragm was more susceptible to interference from the surrounding intestine in patients with COPD. Previous studies suggested ultrasound measured successfully the right DE of 195 patients in 210 patients with a 93% success rate, while the success rate of the left DE was only 21% [17, 18]. Therefore, the right DE and its variation were assessed by ultrasound in this study.",

Moreover, compared with DE5, DE30 was more accurate (characterized as higher sensitivity and specificity, larger AUCROC). The key to the successful extubation is not only the respiratory muscle contractility but also the endurance of the respiratory muscle contraction. Therefore, one measurement often does not sufficiently show the endurance of the respiratory muscle contraction. The variations among each time point for DE may more sufficiently reflect the endurance of diaphragmatic contraction. Our study indicated that compared with \u0394DE30\u22120, the AUCROC and sensitivity of \u0394DE30\u22125 were significantly larger and higher, but specificity was lower.

            "text": "Accordingly, our study showed that the positive predictive value was 94.7% when both indicators were positive, in contrast, the negative predictive value of 80%. When the DE30 plus \u0394DE30\u22125 was used to predict extubation outcome by binary logistic regression analysis, the AUCROC and sensitivity were significantly larger and higher compared with \u0394DE30\u22120 and DE30. On the whole, DE30 plus \u0394DE30\u22125 was considered to be more accurate in predicting extubation outcome. Furthermore, this study showed that compared with traditional parameters such as RSBI, DE30 plus \u0394DE30\u22125 was considered to be more accurate in predicting extubation outcome(the AUCROC and specificity were significantly higher). RSBI reflected effort of all respiratory muscles. So, in presence of diaphragmatic fatigue, accessory muscles could preserve tidal volume for a short time of SBT but not a long time and thus it was prone to failure extubation despite successfully passing the SBT.",

Secondly, the diaphragmatic ultrasound was not operated by two observers at the same time. Thirdly, the left diaphragm was not assessed by ultrasound. The subjects were older COPD patients in this study, and the left hemidiaphragm was frequently obscured by the expanding lung. However, Kim et al.\u2019s study showed that unilateral diaphragm dysfunction was more common than bilateral, and the bilateral evaluation of ultrasound can more accurately represent the diaphragm function [20]. At last, The RR, RSBI, and P/F are also commonly used to predict extubation outcome. When we analyze DE30 combined with these indicators, we found that the predicted value of joint judgment has not been improved significantly (the AUCROC has not been increased). Perhaps because this study is a single-center study, the number of cases is a limitation, and the selected patients are older and more severe. Further research was required to enlarge sample number.",
