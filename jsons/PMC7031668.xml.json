Another class of explanations suggested reciprocity as a reason for cooperation [15], focusing on the benefit to the cooperating individual. When interactions are recurring, conditional cooperative behaviour can evolve, if directed towards individuals that cooperated in previous rounds\u2014even if they are not relatives [2,16\u201318]. This includes direct reciprocity (A helps B and B helps A), and indirect reciprocity (A helps B and C helps A, based on the reputation of A) [19,20]. Cooperation was further suggested to be favoured as a signal for the quality of the cooperating individual, resulting in increased social status, mating success, etc. [21,22]. More recent work investigated the effect of population structure and viscosity\u2014affecting, among other things, the probability of repeating interactions and interactions among kin\u2014on the evolution of cooperation [23\u201328].",

Recently, we suggested an alternative explanation, focusing on the microbes carried by the interacting individual, that can be transmitted both from parent to offspring and between interacting hosts. We showed that microbes that induce host cooperation can evolve under wide conditions [29]. Here, we combine the two approaches and consider both the host's genes and its microbiome coevolving with respect to cooperation. We use the term \u2018cooperation\u2019 throughout, but note that similar phenomena were referred to also as \u2018altruism\u2019 in the literature.",

In light of this evidence, we raised the hypothesis that microbes can also affect the tendency of their hosts to cooperate. Note that in this work, we use the term microbe in the most general sense, referring to an element that inhabits an organism, can affect its behaviour, and can be transmitted both vertically and horizontally. Our results can be relevant to any element that applies to these characteristics (e.g. plasmids, viruses, multicellular symbionts).",

Similarly to genes, microbes can be transmitted vertically, namely inherited, from one individual to its offspring [55\u201359]. Yet, as opposed to genes of multicellular organisms, microbes can also be transmitted horizontally during interactions between hosts [60\u201363]. In fact, interactions among hosts, such as feeding, grooming, sharing resources, and co-sheltering, involve close proximity between the hosts, and thus serve as a platform for microbial transmission [64\u201366]. Due to the ability of microbes to transmit horizontally, they can benefit from inducing their host to help another host, that could be inhabited by their transmitted kin\u2014even when the hosts are not related. In that respect, our theory corresponds to the theory of kin selection, where the relevant \u2018kin\u2019 are not the interacting individuals, but rather the microorganisms that inhabit them.",

First, we broaden the perspective and claim that in fact, the evolution of cooperation by horizontally transmitted elements is relevant to almost any species, via its microbiome, or any other symbiont. Second, we emphasize the link between social interaction and horizontal transmission, which we show, enables the evolution of cooperation under wide conditions.

Hosts interact in pairs, and microbes can affect their hosts' behaviour: microbes of type \u03b1 increase the tendency of their hosts to cooperate during interaction, while microbes of type \u03b2 do not have any effect over their host's behaviour. In addition, a bi-allelic locus at the host genome determines the susceptibility of the host to the microbial effect. Hosts carrying allele S are susceptible to the microbe's effect, and act cooperatively when carrying microbes of type \u03b1. Hosts carrying allele R are resistant to the microbial effect and do not act cooperatively regardless of the microbes they carry. This resistance confers a fitness cost of 0 < \u03b4 < 1 (the case where the resistance cost depends on the microbe type showed similar dynamics, see electronic supplementary material, S1\u2013S3). We thus model a population with four different types of hosts: \u03b1S, \u03b1R, \u03b2S, \u03b2R, defined by the combination of microbe type (\u03b1/\u03b2) and host allele (R/S).",

During interaction, the fitness of the hosts changes according to their behaviour: a host that behaves cooperatively (type \u03b1S only) pays a fitness cost 0 < c < 1 while its partner receives a benefit b > c. A selfish host does not pay the fitness cost, but receives the benefit if its partner is a cooperator. In addition, horizontal transmission of the microbes might occur during interaction (figure 1b). We denote by T\u03b1 the probability of microbes of type \u03b1 being transmitted from one host to the other during interaction, establishing and replacing the resident microbes, and similarly with T\u03b2. We assume that transmission of one microbe is independent of the other microbe, and when both occur, they occur simultaneously. We note that T\u03b1 and T\u03b2 encompass the probability of completing the entire transmission process: traversing the physical barrier, competing with the native microbial community, and establishing a colony. We assume that during an interaction, a host behaves according to the allele\u2013microbe combination it carried before the interaction. If horizontal transmission occurs, the new microbes establish and start affecting host behaviour right after the current interaction.\n",

Denoting the proportions of hosts carrying allele S (\u03b1S and \u03b2S hosts), and of hosts carrying both allele S and microbe \u03b1 (\u03b1S hosts) by xS and x\u03b1S, respectively, we find that the proportion of allele S increases from one generation to the next if and only if (see analysis in electronic supplementary material, S3):2.2x\u03b1SxS<\u03b4c.When \u03b4 > c, condition (2.2) is always satisfied and thus the proportion of allele S increases to fixation for any xS > 0. That is, when the cost of cooperation (c) is smaller than the cost of host resistance to the microbial effect (\u03b4), cooperation will fixate in the population (area II in figure 2a,b). Furthermore, we find that when \u03b4 < c, cooperation can evolve and be maintained in polymorphism, and that a polymorphic equilibrium, when it exists, satisfies x\u03b1S/xS=\u03b4/c.

In addition, we find that the cost of resistance to the microbial effect (\u03b4) is a crucial factor.

In addition, the host behaviour can be modelled as a continuous trait, where the level of cooperation is varied, or condition-dependent. Other interesting host\u2013microbe dynamics can arise when the cooperative behaviour is applied only under certain circumstances, e.g. when the hosts are under stress, similarly to other stress-induced behaviours [76\u201379]. It would also be interesting to examine the evolution of the rates of microbe horizontal and vertical transmission, in the context of microbe-induced cooperation.

Among eukaryotic hosts, Lactobacillus is a promising candidate: accumulating evidence demonstrates that Lactobacillus decreases stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour, potentially increasing the tendency of its host to interact with other individuals, and promoting cooperative behaviour [82\u201385]. In plants, carbon sharing among trees is, at least partially, mediated by mycorrhizal fungi that form networks connecting neighbouring tree roots [86,87]. This behaviour can be considered as cooperation among trees, induced by their fungi. And if considering bacteria as hosts inhabited by mobile genetic elements, it was shown that genes responsible for public goods secretion are prevalent on mobile elements that can be transmitted both horizontally and vertically between host cells [68,69]. Our results suggest that such effects may be common in many other systems as well, and call for experimental tests.",

Moreover, like microbes, culture interacts and coevolves with the genome, and genes can also affect the tendency of individuals to follow cultural rules or not (resistance) [91,92].

These results strengthen the theory of microbe-induced cooperation, and may help explain occurrences of cooperation that are difficult to explain by current theories. Our results provide verifiable predictions that can be tested in future experimental efforts: first, that altering the composition of microbial communities (e.g. by antibiotics [93\u201395], probiotics [96,97], pesticides [98], and herbicides [99]) may affect the host's social behaviour; and second, that polymorphism with respect to cooperative behaviour can be expected in natural populations, originating in a conflict between host genes and microbes.",
