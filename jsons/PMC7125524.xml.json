The GIT is one of the largest and heaviest organ systems of the animal. It is initially divided into the upper GIT (oral cavity, esophagus, forestomachs, abomasum) and the lower GIT (intestines, rectum, and anus). In healthy cattle, the forestomachs occupy more than half the abdominal cavity. The rumen (Fig. 1\n) alone has a capacity range of 102 to 148 L (which approximates to a similar weight in kilograms), whereas the abomasal volume ranges from 10 to 20 L.1 The intestines occupy a much smaller space in the peritoneal cavity but have a length that is considerable, ranging from 33 to 63 m.1 Thus, a thorough examination is physically demanding because of its size and requires a significant proportion of time to adequately examine its entirety.",

The often semifluid to pasty consistency of intestinal contents may obscure the mucosa beneath impairing its thorough examination. It is tempting to scrape this material off of the mucosa with the edge of the necropsy knife, but that damages the underlying epithelium if histopathology is desired. If that is the only means of assessment, then ensure that other segments with similar gross lesions are sampled for histopathology. Small amounts of water under low pressure or small amounts poured over the mucosa more gently clear the contents from the surface and allow more detailed examination. If a pathogen is suspected, representative sections of bowel should be collected for microbiologic testing before opening or flushing the segments. Ensure that segments of intestine collected for microbial testing are kept closed, using string to seal the ends of the segments. When submitting to the laboratory, it is imperative that segments of bowel are packaged separately from other fresh tissues.",

Many dead cattle can have segments of quite red intestine, even with bloody contents, that histologically do not translate into hemorrhage or inflammation. Smudgy red to pink discoloration of gastrointestinal serosa is frequently encountered in adult cattle with prolonged postmortem intervals caused by lysis of red cells with leakage or imbibition of hemoglobin into the tissue interstitium. With time and proliferation of bacteria, imbibed hemoglobin can react with bacteria-derived hydrogen sulfide to produce iron-containing compounds that impart a dark green to black tissue discoloration, referred to as \u201cpseudomelanosis.\u201d",

Ruminal contents tend to have a sweet aromatic scent when cattle are on pasture or fed silage but become more sour and acidic in the face of high-grain diets or in cases of acidosis. Intestinal contents tend to move from coarse to liquid to pasty to semisolid when moving from oral to anal. Deviation from this often correlates with various disease states.

Typically, affected animals present with signs of obstruction or possibly sudden death. The lesion can be segmental with variably sized collections of clotted blood that tend to minimally distend affected loops and yet have an underlying mucosa that is typically grossly normal. Isolation of Clostridium perfringens type A from cattle with this condition has been reported but likely does not represent a definitive cause.17 Others have reported in dairy cattle that intensive management procedures and minimal exposure to pasture in high producing herds are predisposing factors to the development of this syndrome.18\n",
