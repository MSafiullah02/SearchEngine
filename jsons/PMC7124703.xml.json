            "text": "Innate immunity acts in the first line of immune defense mechanisms, having an important function against foreign pathogens in vertebrates and invertebrates. In teleosts, the innate immune system plays a critical role in protecting organism against invading pathogens (Aoki et al., 2013). Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) on antigen-presenting cells play a significant role in innate immunity which recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Zhu et al., 2013a). C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) characterized by the presence of one or more homologous carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) are a large family of Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate binding proteins which can specifically recognize a number of PAMPs including bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi (Lepenies et al., 2013). The CLRs including the collectins, selectins, lymphocyte lectins and proteoglycans were initially divided into two types based on the quantity of conserved CRDs: Type I CLRs such as the macrophage-mannose receptor, DEC205 and selectins have multiple CRDs at their NH2 terminus; and type II CLRs such as hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors, macrophage lectin, DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), Langerin, DC-associated C-type lectin (Dectin-1) and DC immunoreceptor (DCIR) have a single CRD at the COOH-terminus (Redelinghuys and Brown, 2011). Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin, DC-SIGN (CD209) and its homolog, liver/lymphnode-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin, L-SIGN also known as DC-SIGN-related receptor (DC-SIGNR), are two kinds of the type II CLRs sharing similar structure and both serve as cell adhesion and phagocytic pathogen recognition receptors (Khoo et al., 2008). Characters and functions of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN in human had been studied, that both can bind various viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, Dengue virus, and SARS-coronavirus (Alvarez et al, 2002, Geijtenbeek et al, 2000, Lozach et al, 2003). Meanwhile, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN also have different physiological functions and ligand-binding properties that DC-SIGN prior to binding to fucose whilst L-SIGN to mannose to recognize different pathogens (Khoo et al., 2008). Differences are also seen in their tissue distribution that DC-SIGN is expressed on dendritic cells and some types of macrophages, while L-SIGN is expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver, lymph node sinusoids and in the placenta (Boily-Larouche et al., 2007). Human DC-SIGN and L-SIGN structures are composed of 3 domains: a transmembrane domain, CRD and a neck-region which is highly conserved. The two genes were coded by 404 amino acids and 376 amino acids separately sharing 77% identical at the amino acid level (Khoo et al, 2008, Li et al, 2013). The dileucine motif, the tri-acidic cluster and an EPN sequence motif are conserved in both human DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (Khoo et al., 2008). But the structures, genomic organizations and functional motifs in teleost are not very clear. Until now, there have been almost no studies of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN structure and characters in teleost; only DC-SIGN in the zebrafish had been studied which showed that DC-SIGN in zebrafish has conserved domains with other vertebrates and plays a crucial role for the initiation and development of adaptive immunity in zebrafish (Lin et al., 2009). In this study, we analyzed genomic organizations, gene structures, and synteny, evolutionary process and expression of miiuy croaker DC-SIGN (mmDC-SIGN) and L-SIGN (mmL-SIGN). We are the first to comprehensively analyze L-SIGN in fish and gene synteny on genomic level of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN in teleost.",

All the other species DC-SIGN and L-SIGN cDNA sequences were obtained from the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/) and Ensemble Genome Browser (http://www.ensembl.org/) databases (Supplementary Table S3). MEGA 5 software (Tamura et al., 2011) and DNAman were used for the multiple alignment and DNAstar was used to gain the divergence and percent identity values of all the known DC-SIGN and L-SIGN amino acid sequences (Thompson et al., 1994). A phylogenetic tree of several kinds CLRs (CD23, CLEC4G, CD207, ASGR1, CD205, DC-SIGN, L-SIGN and L-SIGN-like) was constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method with bootstrapped 1000 times using the Poisson model in the MEGA5 program. While another phylogenetic tree of all the known L-SIGN sequences was established via the Bayesian approach using MrBayes v3.2 which is running 5,000,000 generation with 25% of trees burned (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) and the resulting tree was visualized and edited by TreeView (Page, 1996). The neighboring genes of mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN were confirmed in genomic regions by BLAST programs and the neighboring genes locations of L-SIGN in other fishes were confirmed by Genomicus (Muffato et al., 2010).",

Introns in both mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN appeared the pattern of GT/AG known by comparison with other vertebrates DC-SIGN and L-SIGN sequences separately, while comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that mmDC-SIGN shared 50.8% to 96.4% identity with DC-SIGN from other species and mmL-SIGN shared 46.9% to 77.3% identity with other species separately (Supplementary Table S2). Both mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN amino acid sequences had two domains: a transmembrane region and a CRD differing from primates which had specific internal repeat domain (Fig. 1C, D). In the DC-SIGN CRD domain, EPD motif and WYD motif existed in miiuy croaker and large yellow croaker instead of EPN motif and WND motif in all other species for determining the carbohydrate binding specificity (Kong et al., 2011); EPN motif, WND motif and four amino acids (Glu269, Asn271, Glu276 and Asn292) existing in CRD domain of mmL-SIGN are well conserved from fish to human. All of the conserved motifs are essential for interacting with Ca2+ for recognizing carbohydrate ligand (Khoo et al., 2008). The tri-acidic cluster is conserved in human DC-SIGN (Svajger et al., 2010) and L-SIGN (Koppel et al., 2005), but not in miiuy croaker. Mm-DC-SIGN and mm-L-SIGN both have four conserved cysteine residues in positions Cys102, Cys181, Cys196, Cys204 and positions Cys169, Cys180, Cys201, Cys278 to form the internal disulfide bridges revealed by multiple sequence alignment which also existed in other known DC-SIGN and L-SIGN sequences of vertebrate (Huang, Meng, 2009, Lin et al, 2009). Miiuy croaker DC-SIGN and L-SIGN had the same domains with other fish, amphibian and bird that showed both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN had conserved domains from fish to mammals except primates.",

L-SIGN-like gene was obtained from miiuy croaker, tilapia, medaka, stickleback from the genome databases. Meanwhile, only one L-SIGN gene existed in human, chimpanzee, rat and xenopus known from genome databases in Ensemble, but there are L-SIGN and L-SIGN-like in some fishes maybe in consequence of the fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD or 3R) to adapt to the specific environment. Only one L-SIGN was found in platyfish maybe because the L-SIGN-like gene was lost after L-SIGN duplicated in platyfish (Fig. 2B). The L-SIGN-like genes with L-SIGN genes formed a cluster that the genes were located in scaffold 59, scaffold GL831260.1, chromosome 22, scaffold JH556680.1, and group XV in miiuy croaker, tilapia, medaka, platyfish and stickleback genomes separately. Sequence alignment of L-SIGN and L-SIGN-like from several fishes was carried out by DNAman software to show that L-SIGN-like shared high similarity with L-SIGN genes containing conserved cysteine residues, a relatively conservative EPN, WND motifs (Fig. 1E). This finding provide more information to reveal the adaptive evolution and selection of L-SIGN genes.",

Miiuy croaker L-SIGN was located between L-SIGN-like and TTC8, and also differences happened among the linear organization of the five fishes in basic chromosome number and the amount of surrounding genes. Both miiuy croaker and tilapia formed a cluster containing five C-type lectin receptors, but only two C-type lectin receptors were clustered together in other three fishes. There was one L-SIGN and one L-SIGN-like in four fishes except platyfish (Fig. 1G). Among these fish genomes, genes from TTC8 to ENTPD5 located downstream of L-SIGN had conserved synteny only differing in no RABEPK gene in miiuy croaker and no RABEPK and ALDH6A1 in stickleback. Upstream of L-SIGN gene, only miiuy croaker had C14ORF140 and medaka had two NEK9 which were the biggest difference among these fishes. Stickleback was lacking in ACYP1, different from all other fishes (Fig. 1F). Among the CLR members, two genes (L-SIGN-like and MRC2) in tilapia had different orientation from other fishes. But synteny analysis still revealed that the gene loci for L-SIGN in teleost were quite conserved.",

Firstly, the value of \u03c9 was 0.26 in the one-ratio model which assumed that one unique \u03c9 in all branches of the tree (p = 0.00, Supplementary Table S4), showing that the entire L-SIGN genes underwent the purifying selection. Secondly, the free-ratio model fitted the data significantly better than the one ratio-model (p = 0.00, Supplementary Table S4). Finally, the branch-site model was used to detect whether positive selection sites existed in ancestral lineages of fishes. No positive selection sites were found in ancestral lineages of fishes (Supplementary Table S4). Meanwhile, multiple ML methods were carried out to explore the selective pressures on L-SIGN genes of fishes. For fishes L-SIGN genes, no positive selection genes were detected in M2a and M8 model (Table 1\n), but other ML methods detected positive selection sites in this group (Table 2\n). To improve the accuracy of positive selection sites, we considered that the site under positive selection should be detected in at least three of the ML methods. So we found one positive selection site (287, Table 2) on fishes L-SIGN genes. The result showed that the ancestral lineages of fishes underwent purifying selection, but the current lineages of fishes underwent positive selection. The fishes had lived in aquatic environment which was filled with countless types and numerous amounts of pathogens. As the years went by, the aquatic environment had changed greatly and the pathogen significantly differs from before. Due to the change of aquatic environment, the fishes must further evolve to adapt to the environment. So we detected positive selection sites in current fishes of L-SIGN genes.",

The highest expression level of mmDC-SIGN was in liver, muscle and intestines, while the expression in gill and heart was weak. Miiuy croaker L-SIGN have a very high level expression in intestines and spleen and moderate expression in kidney and liver, while the expression level in heart, muscle, eye, gill, fin and brain was much lower than other tested tissues (Fig. 3A\n). In Vibiro anguillarum challenged groups, the tissue distribution and temporal response levels of mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN at different hours were detected in the infected liver, kidney and spleen. In infected liver group, both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have a sharp up-regulation in 6 h and floating up and down from 12 h to 36 h, then reaching the peak at 48 h and sharply decreasing in 72 h (Fig. 3B). In spleen, the expression of DC-SIGN was volatile from 6 h to 72 h; the highest expression level and lowest expression level were at 24 h and 12 h. The expression of L-SIGN floats up and down from 6 h to 36 h, then increased gradually and reached its peak at 72 h (Fig. 3C). In the kidney, the expression of DC-SIGN increased and reached its peak at 24 h and the lowest expression level was at 36 h, while the highest expression level and lowest expression level of L-SIGN occurred in 48 h and 72 h, respectively (Fig. 3D). Both the expressions of mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN were up-regulated in infected liver, spleen and kidney at different sampling time points, and mmL-SIGN had the same trend with mmDC-SIGN in floating up and down in liver and kidney.

But only one L-SIGN gene was found in mammals and frog. Two L-SIGN genes existed in some fishes maybe because of FSGD. From gene synteny, the L-SIGN and L-SIGN-like clustered together maybe to perform more functions to recognize and defend pathogens.
