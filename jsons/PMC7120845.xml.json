            "text": "Coronaviruses, and other nidoviruses such as arteriviruses, produce one of the largest sets of viral polypeptide species among the RNA viruses. This feature is related to the polycistronic nature of their genome, which contains up to 12 open reading frames and, in particular, to the polyprotein strategy used to produce the large viral replicase/transcriptase, the complex set of nonstructural proteins that is responsible for replication and transcription of the nidovirus genome [see (\n1) and the references therein]. In coronaviruses (Fig.\n16.1), the larger of the two replicase polyproteins (pp1ab) can be more than 7000 amino acids long and is processed into 15 or 16 cleavage products, now commonly referred to as nonstructural protein (nsp) 1 to 16 (\n2,3). In arteriviruses, despite their much smaller replicase size (pp1ab is \u201conly\u201d \u223c3100 to 3900 amino acids), the complexity is not very different and replicase processing yields 13 or 14 cleavage products. The regulated autoproteolysis of nidovirus replicase pp1a and pp1ab is driven by two to four proteinases that reside in the ORF1a-encoded part of the replicase. Cleavage sites for coronavirus and arterivirus proteinases have been identified for several prototypic nidoviruses through a combination of theoretical and experimental methods and can now be confidently predicted for other members of these virus groups.\n\n",

It should be noted that intermediates of replicase polyprotein processing, which have been described for various nidoviruses, are not taken into consideration in this count and are likely to even further increase the repertoire of viral polypeptides produced in infected cells. Replicase precursors and processing intermediates in fact complicate certain types of analyses, such as those that rely on microscopy, since antibodies will usually not discriminate among precursors, intermediates, and processing end products. In the infected cell, many nidovirus proteins are targeted to specific locations (Fig.\n16.2), some of them even to multiple specific locations.\n\n",

In particular, when the target protein has to be studied against a background of a large number of other proteins, either in whole fixed cells or in cell lysates, specific antibodies can provide a rapid and reliable method for discriminating signal from noise. Three commonly used antibody-based detection techniques, which are also important for screening of the immune response during antiserum production, are discussed below:\nIn situ immunodetection of the target in fixed cells, either by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy (IEM).Detection of the target by Western blotting (WB), i.e., electrophoresis of a cell lysate containing the target and transfer of the (denatured) proteins to a solid carrier such as nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes.Immunoprecipitation (IP) of the target from a cell lysate, often used in combination with radioactive labeling of protein synthesis in the cells for a specific time prior to cell lysis.\n",

Furthermore, in the context of specific research questions, polyclonal antisera may sometimes even be preferred over monoclonal antibodies since they contain a mixture of immunoglobulin molecules, derived from different B-cell lines in the immunized animal, often recognizing multiple epitopes of the target protein. Moreover, if desired, the chances of cross-reactivity of the antiserum with related proteins, e.g., from different strains of the same virus or from closely related other virus species, are considerably better for polyclonal antisera, particularly when they have been raised using a larger and/or conserved part of the target protein.",

For rabbits, if necessary, bleeds of \u223c15\u201320 ml can be obtained at 4-week intervals, and the final bleed can yield up to 50 ml of serum from about 80 ml of whole blood. Since monoclonal antibodies are routinely produced in mice, the use of other species such as rabbits also creates the possibility of convenient in situ double-labeling experiments (see below). In such experiments, using species-specific secondary antibodies, a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the target of choice and, for instance, a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing a cellular protein can be used in combination to detect both proteins in the same specimen simultaneously.",

The production of antigens in E. coli are not covered in any detail in this chapter and the reader is referred to the extensive literature on this topic published elsewhere (and in 10.1007/978-1-59745-181-9_13 in this volume). E. coli allows for the cheap production of large amounts of antigen, but clearly such antigens have to be purified prior to use for immunization. This can be facilitated, e.g., by the use of a variety of tags (such as fusion to glutathione-S-transferase, maltose-binding protein, or the commonly used hexahistidine tag) for which convenient affinity resins are available. Reasonably pure antigens (>80% pure) are required and in the case of larger tags one should consider removing the tag proteolytically to ensure that the immune response will be directed against the target rather than against its tag. If the E. coli expression product turns out to be insoluble, which will usually interfere with its straightforward affinity purification, it may still be possible to purify a reasonably pure protein sample from inclusion bodies by repeated extraction of this material with increasing concentrations of urea (or guanidium isothiocyanate). As long as small amounts of this material can be used (i.e., the protein concentration is sufficiently high), after washing of the protein pellets with PBS, such urea-containing samples can be used for mixing with the adjuvant and immunization without the need for dialysis.",

For example, cross-linking at lysine residues can be represented as:\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n{\\rm BSA(Lys)}{-}{\\rm NH}_2 + {\\rm O}{=}{\\rm CH(CH2)}_3{\\rm CH}{=}{\\rm O} + {\\rm NH}_2{-}{\\rm (Lys)peptide} \\rightarrow\\\\\n{\\rm BSA(Lys)}{-}{\\rm N}{-}{\\rm CH(CH2)}_3{\\rm CH}{-}{\\rm N}{-}{\\rm\n(Lys)peptide} + 2 {\\rm H}_2{\\rm O}\n\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\nIn a microfuge tube, prepare a solution of \u223c5 mg/ml of the peptide in PBS. (Routinely, our peptide synthesis yields about 5 mg of product, of which \u223c4 mg is the peptide and the remainder consists of salts). Weigh the dry peptide on a piece of paper and carefully split it with a scalpel (wear gloves). For a solution of \u223c5 mg/ml, dissolve about half of the peptide in a final volume of 0.4 ml of PBS. Solubility in PBS is usually good if the freeze-dried product looks \u201clarge and fluffy.\u201d If it looks small and granular, it may be better to first dissolve the peptide in a small volume of DMSO and then dilute this solution in PBS. The final concentration of DMSO should be less than 5%.Add BSA (the carrier protein) to the peptide solution at the correct molar ratio. The aim is to couple one peptide per about 50 amino acids of carrier protein, for about 12 peptides per BSA molecule. The amount of peptide can be estimated with the following formula, which assumes an average molecular mass (Mr) of 110  Da per amino acid: (volume)\u2217(concentration)/(x-mer\u2217110), or\u2014 in a 21 mer example\u2014 (0.4 ml)\u2217(5 mg/ml)/(21\u2217110 \u03bcg/\u03bcmol) = 0.86 \u03bcmole. Calculate the required amount of BSA, which is 618 amino acids long (including 59 lysine residues) and thus weighs \u223c68 mg/\u03bcmol. Mixing peptide and BSA at a molar ratio of 12:1 means that in our example using 0.86 \u03bcmol of peptide, we would use 0.86/12 = 0.072 \u03bcmol of BSA (or 4.9 mg, or 98 \u03bcl of a 50-mg/ml solution).\n",

Clearly, since the sequence is known, the Mr of the peptide can be calculated more precisely. However, since we usually add extra lysines to the peptide there will be different ways in which it can be coupled to the carrier and a variety of complexes will be formed (BSA \u201ctrees\u201d with a varying number of peptide \u201cbranches\u201d scattered all over the backbone), presenting the epitope in many different ways.\n3.To the peptide-BSA mixture, add PBS to give a final volume of 670 \u03bcl; then (carefully, slowly, and while mixing) add 330 \u03bcl of a freshly prepared 0.3% glutaraldehyde solution (equaling approximately 10 \u03bcmol).4.Incubate the coupling reaction on a roller device at room temperature for 1 h to allow cross-linking of peptide and carrier protein.5.Add 200 \u03bcl of 1-M glycine in order to quench the remaining free glutaraldehyde and continue rolling for 1 h.6.Dialyze the coupling reaction overnight against PBS to remove small molecules such as uncoupled peptide, glycine, and glycine-glutaraldehyde. Dialyze two or three times against at least 500 volumes of PBS at 4\u00b0C. The final step can be overnight. Usually, after dialysis, the concentration of peptide-BSA complex is around 4 mg/ml and the solution is ready for direct use as an antigen in immunization.\n",

            "text": "When using synthetic peptides or proteins purified from E. coli, adjuvants containing immunostimulatory molecules are applied to enhance the immune response to the antigen. Freund\u2019s adjuvants have been used in our studies; Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (FCA) for the initial immunization and Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant (FICA) for subsequent booster immunizations. FCA (but not FICA) contains heat-inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium butyricum (or extracts thereof), which stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity. The water-in-oil emulsion that is the basis for FCA guarantees the slow release of the antigen from the site of immunization, but it should be noted that the mineral oil component is quite toxic and induces granulomatous reactions. Mix FCA/FICA with the antigen-containing solution to form a \u201ctoothpaste-like\u201d stable emulsion. See below for details. In our standard protocol, \u223c200 \u03bcg of antigen (peptide-BSA complex) is used for the primary immunization, and the same amount for subsequent booster reactions.\nBefore use, mix the FCA, e.g., gently on a roller device to get the bacteria into suspension. For the primary immunization, the antigen (200\u2013250 \u03bcg) is diluted with PBS to give a final volume of 0.8 ml PBS, which is mixed with 0.4 ml of FCA. Transfer this mixture to a 3-ml syringe (luer-lock). Use a P1000 micropipette; put the tip in the opening of the syringe, and slowly pull the plunger back. In the same manner, fill a second syringe with 0.4 ml of FCA and 0.4 ml of air (to promote the formation of the emulsion).Connect the two syringes with a three-way stopcock (Fig.\n16.3). Mix the contents of the two syringes until a thick, white emulsion is obtained. This means that the suspension is converted into an oily mass that includes the water. This emulsion, when properly prepared, is stable and will not disperse when a droplet is put into PBS. The emulsion will ensure the slow release of the antigen into the animal.\n\nDisconnect the syringes and use the antigen suspension the same day. Optionally, the syringes can be stored for later use, overnight at 4\u00b0C or for longer periods at \u201380\u00b0C.For booster immunizations FICA is used instead of FCA. Material for two boosts can be prepared in one action by doubling the volumes above. Filled syringes can be stored at \u201380\u00b0C for prolonged periods of time.\n",

The most reactive rabbit antisera that we have produced can be used in IF assays at dilutions of between 1:1000 and 1:5000. For initial testing, however, dilutions on the order of 1:100 to 1:500 are advised.\nWash the cells once with PBS and fix the cells at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for at least 30 min (or overnight).Wash the cells once with PBS containing 10 mM glycine (coverslips in sealed dishes can be stored at 4\u00b0C in PBS for many weeks).Using sharp tweezers, carefully transfer coverslips to the wells of a prelabeled 24-well cluster containing PBS-glycine. Be sure to remember, every time you handle the coverslips, on which side there are cells. While in the cluster, cells should always be facing upward.Permeabilize the cells at room temperature for 10 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100.In 5 min, wash the cells three times with PBS-glycine and leave them in the last wash step.Dilute the primary antiserum (initial dilutions, e.g., 1:100 and 1:500) in PBS containing 5% FCS; 50 \u03bcl per coverslip (10-mm-diameter) will be needed.Cut a large piece of parafilm, place it in a larger dish, label the position of the various samples, and place 50-\u03bcl drops of the antiserum dilutions on the parafilm.

            "text": "In contrast to WB analysis, immunoprecipitation relies on recognition of the target in solution. Depending on the conditions used, proteins can either be close to their native confirmation, partially denatured, or completely denatured (e.g., in the presence of high concentrations of SDS). Thus, the conformation of the antigen used for immunization may influence the results. In our experience, linear antigens such as synthetic peptides may yield antisera that work considerably better in immunoprecipitation assays carried out under stringent denaturing conditions (e.g., 0.5\u20131% SDS), which will often also reduce the background in the assay (Fig.\n6\nB). Nevertheless, the optimal concentration of SDS should be determined for every antigen-antiserum pair since the optimum may be as low as 0.1% SDS, e.g., when using antibodies recognizing mainly (or exclusively) conformational epitopes. Furthermore, the amount of antiserum in the immunoprecipitation assay is important. For initial screening of rabbit antisera we usually test 1 and 5 \u03bcl of the antiserum in a 300 \u03bcl total IP volume.\nTake 50 \u03bcl of 35S-labeled cell lysate in protein lysis buffer (\n12)(equaling about 2\u20134 \u00d7105 cells; obviously the expression level of the target protein is to be considered as well); add 250 \u03bcl of IP buffer and the antiserum (1 or 5 \u03bcl). Incubate these \u223c300-\u03bcl samples overnight (or for at least 3 h) at 4\u00b0C while swirling.Wash the pansorbin cells (25 \u03bcl for each sample) by mixing with an equal volume of IP buffer, spin down for 20 sec at full speed in a microcentrifuge, and resuspend the pansorbin cell pellet in the original volume (again, 25 \u03bcl for each sample).Add 25 \u03bcl of washed pansorbin cells to each immunoprecipitation and incubate at 4\u00b0C for more than 1 h while swirling.Spin down for 1 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge, remove the supernatant, and add 500 \u03bcl of weak wash buffer A; vortex until the pellet is completely resuspended. (Optionally, this step can be repeated once to get a cleaner result.)Spin down for 1 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge again and repeat the same washing procedure with weak wash buffer B.Resuspend the pellet in 30 \u03bcl of LSB by pipetting up and down.Before loading the samples on an SDS-PAGE gel, denature at 96\u00b0C for 3 min. (For some proteins, e.g., very hydrophobic ones, it may be better not to heat the samples and just leave them in LSB for 15 min or longer.)Spin the pansorbin cells down for 2 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge; do not resuspend the pellet! Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and load part of this sample onto an SDS-PAGE gel.Following SDS-PAGE, process the gel for autoradiography or phosphorimager analysis according to standard protocols and expose for 1\u20137 days.\n",

Remnants of PBS on the coverslip can cause background when the dried PBS forms crystals.Mounting solutions can sometimes have strange side effects, especially when the cells are not freshly fixed. For example, the use of ProLong Gold mounting fluid can generate a green nonspecific nucleolar signal.When microscopy slides used for embedding are not clean, wipe them first with a tissue with 70% ethanol, next with water, and then with a dry paper towel/tissue. When ethanol is not removed, a (sometimes bright) orange background may result.Occasionally, antisera judged to be negative in IF using paraformaldehyde-fixed cells can become positive using methanol-fixed cells (or the other way round). However, methanol fixation is less gentle and generally the morphology of the cell is less well preserved. Fixation is performed for 10 min at \u201320\u00b0C (using ice-cold 100% methanol or 95% methanol/5% acetic acid) and cells are subsequently transferred to and kept in PBS-glycine. Methanol immediately dissolves all cellular membranes, so there is no need for permeabilization with Triton-X100 during the IF assay.Western blotting results can be improved by using longer washing steps.\n",

Depicted is the cytoplasmic replication cycle, which starts with virus entry and release of the genome into the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the genome is translated to produce replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved to yield 16 nonstructural proteins (\n2). A complex for viral RNA synthesis is assembled on cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). This complex is involved in genome replication and the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs, which are required to express the genes in the 3\u2032-proximal third of the genome. Translation of the smallest subgenomic mRNA yields the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) that assembles into new nucleocapsid (NC) structures together with newly generated genome RNA. Other subgenomic mRNAs encode viral envelope proteins that are (largely co-translationally) inserted into membranes of the host cell\u2019s exocytic pathway and migrate toward the site of virus assembly [the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)]. Following budding of the NC through membranes that contain viral envelope proteins, the new virions leave the cell via the exocytic pathway. [Adapted from (\n1).]",

Detection was with an anti-rabbit IgG HRPO conjugate and a chemiluminescence assay.

Following the IP, samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and signal was detected using autoradiography. As specificity controls, the preimmune serum was tested on EAV-infected cells and the postimmune serum was tested on mock-infected cells. Furthermore, for the left panel the binding of the antiserum to the antigen was done in the presence of 0.1% SDS, whereas 0.5% SDS was used for the right panel.
