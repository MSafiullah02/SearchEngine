Unlike other pharmaceutical products, which have large commercial markets to justify the expense of manufacturing capacity, vaccines have limited markets, often with governments or NGOs such as GAVI as the only purchasers [4]. In the case of the Ebola rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine developed by Merck, approval by regulatory authorities took years to achieve, and concerns about the ability to rapidly scale-up manufacturing in response to a worsening Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo prompted discussions about reducing the vaccine dosage or using the vaccines sparingly [5].

Countries with sufficient resources need to invest in new technologies, processes, and governance to be able to rapidly immunize a large proportion of the global population. Three interrelated approaches would permit rapid scale-up of vaccine manufacturing. First, the continued refinement and use of platform technologies can shorten the pre-clinical phase of development [9]. Indeed, annual seasonal influenza vaccines are rapidly developed from a platform that requires replacement of a subsection of the vaccine matched to the circulating strain(s). From a more technologically advanced perspective, vaccine approaches such as viral-vector, peptide-based, DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines may offer true \u201cplug-and-play\u201d capabilities and thus appear to be a particularly promising platform technology [9].",

This evaluation could include a combination of epidemiologic and economic modeling, operations research, and a social and behavioral health component. We would suggest that this novel approach could improve the reach and timeliness of mass vaccination campaigns across high-, middle-, and low-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, and should be supported by governments, researchers, and funders.
