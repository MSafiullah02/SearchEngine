The supervised learning methods require CC records to be labeled with syndromes before being used for model training. Naive Bayesian [8], [9], [10] and Bayesian network [4] models are two examples of the supervised learning methods studied. One prerequisite of supervised learning methods is collecting a sufficient amount of training records, which is usually costly and time-consuming. Another major disadvantage of supervised learning methods is the lack of flexibility. New syndromic definitions may be required by public health practitioners as new events may indicate new surveillance focuses. However, it is often difficult to produce new training data for new syndromic definitions.",

Based on this measure, EMI will be substantially higher than other random patterns if c is by itself a phrase and its subpatterns a and b appear in the text only because of c. For instance, c\n = \u201c\u201d may appear in the text 9 times. Its subpatterns a\n = \u201c\u201d and b\n = \u201c\u201d appear in the text only because they are the subpatterns of c.

It is interesting to note that MIM has significantly higher F measure and F2 measure in all syndromic categories except the fever syndrome.

A review of translation results in this syndromic category shows that one keyword (\u201cfever\u201d) can cover more than 90% of all true positive cases.
