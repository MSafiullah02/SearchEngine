Traditional method on attribute prediction make great effort on the study of social network data, but ignore massive volumes of disparate, dynamic, and temporal data derived from ubiquitous mobile and sensor devices. For example, daily walking step counts produced by pedometer. Multiple demographic prediction on temporal data have two problems. First one is that differential effectiveness of different time period data for prediction is unclear. And another one is how to effectively learn the complementary correlations between different attributes. To address the above problem, we propose a novel model named Correlation-Aware Neural Embedding with Attention (CANEA), which first directly separates different attribute oriented feature using separated embedding layer, and use attention mechanism to assign a higher weight to dominant time point. Then it captures informative correlations using correlation learning layer. Finally we obtain the refined task-specific representations with optimal correlation information for predicting certain attributes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.",

Conventional applications of demographic prediction tend to pay attention to users' behavior in social networks, and few people pay attention to mobile and sensor devices. However, sensor data for demographic prediction has it's own unique applications. For example, it's hard to use online speech to infer the age and gender of a person who rarely speaks on social networks, but it's easier to infer such attribute via his or her pedometer records, as the walking is a daily stable behavior. Besides, the attributes predicted through sensor data could be directly used to enable human-computer interaction more humanized and friendly in smart home system. For example, when a young lady go home from outside, the air conditioning and audio could select a gender/age-aware response (air conditioning temperature and music) from many possible candidates to make the user more comfortable [10] .",

They mostly come from Facebook [12] , Twitters [2, 13] , microblogs [17] , YouTube [4] , web search queries [6] , social networking chats [11] , and forum posts [3] . And little work is put into the management of sensor data. Besides, traditional demographic prediction model can not fully learn the complementary correlations between different attributes. Existing work usually infer users' different attributes separately without taking account of correlation learning or infer all the attributes together using shared embedding at the bottom of model. For example, wang et al. [16] proposed a Structured Neural Embedding (SNE) model that use shared embedding to leverages the potential correlations for multi-task learning by concatenating structured label. However, the concatenated formalization makes the prediction task more difficult than separated tasks since the output space for each task becomes much larger. Raehyun et al. [8] proposed an Embedding Transformation Network (ETN) model that shares user representations at the bottom and converts them to task-specific representations using a linear transformation. But this model does not take any steps to explicitly learn the complementary relationship between different task-specific features.",

We have to admit that shared embedding retain informative correlations among multiple attributes, and separated embedding method seems to ignore these correlations. But this shared embedding lacks explanations for correlation extraction. And in the next section, we will introduce correlation learning layer to learn these correlations in a more interpretable way. Considering that the pedometer data is a kind of temporal data, we adopt the most popular sequence learning model of LSTM [5] as the backbone of each embedding branches. In this paper, we assume that the contexts from both past and future are useful and complementary to each other. Therefore we combine forward (left to right) and backward (right to left) recurrent to build a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) [14] . Moreover, the stacked recurrent layers are used to build a deep RNN model to enhance the representation ability of the separated embedding layer.

According to this result, it could be demonstrated that capturing such correlations has great significance in multi-task prediction. (2) As we emphasized in this paper, the ability to learn correlations between different tasks is important in multi-task learning. JNE, SNE, ETN and ETNA use the shared embedding that implicitly leverage these correlations, but ignore the interferences among multiple tasks. We first use the separated embedding to avoid such interference, and then employ the correlation learning to obtain the correlations. Although we use the most simple architectures of our models for baseline comparison (see Sect. 4.4) , which still outperform all the baselines with a significant gap. (3) The attention mechanism is helpful for separation embedding. As shown in Table 2 , the CANEA is obviously better than the CANEA b . As aforementioned, they have the similar architecture, except that the former model introduces the attention mechanism into separated Embedding layer to weaken unimportant factors and highlight the important factors of the input.
