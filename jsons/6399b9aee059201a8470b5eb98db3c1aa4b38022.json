Here, we introduce a system for long-term assessment of AF susceptibility (substrate) in ambulatory rats implanted with miniature electrodes on the atrium. Rats were subjected to excessive aldosterone (Aldo) or solvent only (Sham). An additional group was exposed to myocardial infarction (MI). AF substrate was tested two-and four-weeks post implantation and was also compared with implanted rats early post-implantation (Base). Aldo and MI increased the AF substrate and atrial fibrosis. In the MI group only, AF duration was correlated with the level of atrial fibrosis and was inversely correlated with systolic function. Unexpectedly, Shams also developed progressive AF substrate relative to Base individuals. Further studies indicated that serum inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha) were not elevated in the shams. In addition, we excluded anxiety\\depression due to social-isolation as an AF promoting factor. Finally, enhanced biocompatibility of the atrial electrode did not inhibit the gradual development of AF substrate over a testing period of up to 8 weeks. Overall, we successfully validated the first system for long-term AF substrate testing in ambulatory rats.",

However, over the last two decades, rodents have been increasingly used to study various mechanistic aspects in the pathophysiology of AF 12-18 , and the possibility of using rodents to test new therapies seems attractive. However, several technical limitations constrain the widespread utility of rodents in AF research. Particularly, the small and delicate rodent atria render the implantation of chronic pacing and recording open Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:553 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57528-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ electrodes challenging. As a result, AF substrate is evaluated using either ex-vivo preparations or invasive studies in deeply anesthetized rodents that are sacrificed at the end of the procedure. Indeed, repeated testing of AF substrate development over time utilizing measurements under physiological conditions, (i.e. in the unanesthetized state) has not been reported thus far to the best of our knowledge. Recently, Hulsmans et al. 19 reported the development of a miniaturized pacemaker for long-term pacing studies in rodents. However, although this technically-advanced system may open remarkable new opportunities, the currently introduced pacer could not be used for the electrophysiological (EP) testing, which was done conventionally under deep anesthesia as a single terminal procedure.",

Failure of the initial procedure occurred in less than 10% of cases and included either periprocedural mortality or failure in the implantation of the atrial MBHE leading to absence of effective atrial pacing. During preliminary experiments we encountered failures to reach the final EP testing at 4 weeks in several occasions as a result of self-extraction of the back connector. This problem was totally resolved by the placement of a shielding ring over the back connector ( Fig. 1) . Initial experiments included 43 rats divided into 3 groups: Base group (n = 12) implant with the atrial pacing & recording device EP tested at 1 W only. These animals were thereafter used for atrial tachypacing experiments, which were recently reported 25 and are beyond the scope of the current study. Sham group (n = 15) co-implanted with atrial pacing & recording devices and osmotic mini-pumps delivering solvent only (PEG-400). Aldosterone (Aldo) group (n = 16) co-implanted with atrial pacing & recording devices and osmotic mini-pumps delivering Aldosterone dissolved in PEG-400. An additional MI group (n = 14) included rats subjected to device implantation and left coronary artery ligation. An additional sham-operated group maintained two in a cage separated by a mesh barrier, was also included (n = 7) in order to test the contribution of social isolation as a source of intrinsic AF substrate. Finally, a new MBHE composed of medical-grade silicone and Platinum-Iridium (Pt-Ir) poles was also evaluated (n = 13). Apart from the base group, all of the reported EP results are only for rats that could be tested serially at 2 W and 4 W. For the new MBHE, reported results include serial tests up to 8 W from the initial surgery.",

Briefly, the implantable device is composed of an 8-pin 'female' connector that is attached by highly flexible insulated electrical wires (AS155-36, Cooner wires, Chatsworth, CA) to a single miniature-bipolar hook electrode (MBHE). The MBHE contains a distal head with two sharp tungsten pins (100 \u03bcM in diameter, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA) that are curved and isolated by an insulated coating (transparent melting glue) up to their tips (Fig. 1A) . By means of small lateral thoracotomy the MBHE can be fixed on the selected epicardial surface without the need for additional suturing 20, [22] [23] [24] . Three additional single lead electrodes are utilized for grounding and peripheral ECG measurements (Fig. 1A) . Before implantation, the 8-pin 'female' connector and the distal part of the MBHE were covered with latex to prevent direct contact with the skin and subcutaneous tissue during the procedure. Electron beam radiation was applied for sterilization of the device before its use. For device implantation animals were anesthetized (IM ketamine/ xylazine 75/5 mg kg \u22121 ) and mechanically ventilated. Under sterile conditions and constant heating, the MBHE was implanted on the RA, the peripheral electrodes were positioned in the animal's back and the 8-pin 'female' connector was exteriorized through the skin. A shielding ring with four plastic restraints was used to prevent extraction of the device over time (Fig. 1A,B) . After implantation, the ring was inserted over the connector, sutured to the skin and glued to the connector over four plastic restraints. This procedure largely prevented cases of connector extraction during the long periods in which the rats were fully ambulatory (Fig. 1C) . Post-operative recovery and analgesia were performed as described previously 24 .",

This MBHE is composed of Platinum-Iridium (Pt-Ir) electrical poles, miniature stainless steel hooking pins and medical-grade silicon. In order to fabricate this MBHE, the distal end of two flexible electrical wires coming from the implantable device (AS155-36, Cooner wires, Chatsworth, CA) were inserted in their distal end with Pt-Ir rods (2 mm in length, 200 \u03bcM in diameter). The Pt-Ir rods were then placed parallel to each other on the bottom of a cubic shaped Teflon template (5 mm length \u00d7 2.5 mm width \u00d7 2 mm height), which was subsequently filled with medical-grade silicon (MED-6219P, Nusil, CA). Following incubation of the silicon for 24 hours at room temperature, the electrode was extracted from the Teflon template and two stainless steel insect pins (26002-10, Fine Science Tools, Vancouver, Canada) were angled and embedded into the silicon to form a double hook. An additional shorter pin was inserted in the rear part of the electrode to prevent extraction of the MBHE from the cardiac tissue over time. Following preparation electrodes were excessively washed with 70% ethanol and were sterilized with electron beam radiation before use. AF substrate evaluation. Each AF substrate evaluation was done following overnight adaptation of the animal to the EP cage according to standard burst pacing protocol. The protocol was performed during the early daytime hours of the circadian cycle when animals were inactive. Each AF substrate evaluation protocol included 20 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ consecutive atrial pacing bursts (20 S, double diastolic threshold, 10 ms cycle length-CL). Analysis of AF inducibility was performed by calculating the percentage of positive episodes (defined as episodes lasing more than 1 S). Analysis of AF duration was performed by calculating \"Total AF duration score\" as detailed below. Arrhythmic episodes were identified by recordings demonstrating more than one atrial signal per QRS and atrial signal which was clearly different in morphology in comparison with the regular atrial signal during sinus rhythm. We did not discriminate between regular and irregular atrial rhythms in the current analysis. Arrhythmic episodes lasting more than 5 minutes were aborted using short (1 S) pacing bursts of increasing intensity until sinus rhythm was restored. The minimal time between pacing bursts was 1 minute. If an episode of more than 1 minute was detected, the delay from the end of this episode to the next pacing burst was equal to the duration of the episode.",

Although most of the arrhythmic episodes induced by burst pacing in rats are rather short and convert spontaneously to sinus rhythm, the analysis of total AF duration is sometimes complicated by sporadic long lasting episodes that can last several minutes and more. While the latter episodes are not common, they can have a profound effect on the analysis. In order to be able to evaluate changes in AF duration that attenuate the contribution of these long sporadic episodes, the \"total AF duration score\" (range 0-5) was defined as follows: 0 -negative (less than 1 S); 1-episode duration between 1-5 sec; 2-episode duration between 5-20 sec; 3-episode duration between 20-60 sec; 4-episode duration between 60-240 sec; 5-episode duration of more than 240 sec.

Our MBHE system normally requires holding of the rats in separate cages in order to prevent damage to the back connector by the cage mates. Since chronic social isolation is a known trigger of anxiety\\depression in rats 33 , we raised the possibility that this factor might be involved in the observed AF substrate formation. To test this option in a direct manner we used a simple manipulation allowing socially rewarding interaction between rats through a mesh-barrier 34 . First, we directly confirmed that behavioral parameters of anxiety\\depression are markedly inhibited in rats interacting through a mesh-barrier (Supplemental text and Supplementary Figure S2 ). Based on these findings, an additional group of sham-operated rats were maintained for 4 W in cages containing a mesh-barrier. Interestingly, EP analysis revealed that this manipulation could not reduce the AF substrate (Fig. 6) . On the contrary, at 4 W animals in the non-isolated group had small but significant increase in AF induction compared to the original (Isolated) sham group. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ AF substrate with the new Platinum-Iridium based MBHE. Based on the above results, we next hypothesized that intrinsic AF substrate of the sham-operated rats might be related to local interaction between components of the MBHE and the RA tissue, possibly triggering local toxic\\inflammatory effects over time. Specifically, we suspected that tungsten, which was recently suggested to have unfavorable long-term effects as a chronically implanted material 35 , was involved in this phenomenon. To address this possibility, a new type of MBHE was fabricated. In this type of MBHE, tungsten was replaced by Pt-Ir electrode poles and miniature stainless steel pins were used for hooking of the MBHE on the atria (Fig. 7A,B ). In addition, as detailed in the methods section, medical grade silicon was used in this electrode instead of the transparent melting glue, which was used in the original MBHE. Thus, all of the components of the new electrode were made out of inert biocompatible components.",

However, this study is the first in which the system was successfully employed for repeated EP evaluations over a period of several weeks (up to 8 W with the new MBHE, Fig. 7) . A rather simple technical improvement that enabled this achievement was the use of a shielding ring that was sutured to the skin around the back connector (Fig. 1A,B ). This addition www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ efficiently prevented device extraction over time by the rats. Apart from this modification, our previously developed MBHE system was well-suited for the long-term EP studies of the present work. Repeated AF substrate evaluations were efficiently obtained from the RA electrode while leaving the LA tissue free of surgical operation Fig. 3) , maintained in separate cages (Isolated) and an additional group of sham rats in which chronic social isolation was prevented by placing two rats in each cage separated by a mesh barrier preventing the rats from damaging each others' connectors (see details in text). (A) AF inducibility. (B) Total AF duration score. Note that in contrast to our prediction, prevention of social isolation did not prevent AF substrate formation.

Atrial-unipolar recordings which we utilized to view the atrial activity of the rats were far superior to the peripheral recordings in terms of atrial signal detection and analysis (Fig. 1E ) as we also reported recently (See Fig. 1C in Mulla et al. 25 ). However, a clear limitation of the current setup was the inability to obtain additional EP parameters such as atrial refractoriness (AERP). This is related to the fact that only two electrical poles are present in the current MBHE design and such setup does not allow clear detection of the atrial signal during pacing 20 . Clearly, a future improvement of the system enabling the insertion of two pairs of electrical poles (one pair for pacing and additional one for recording) would be of great value. Such an improvement might also enable measurements of conduction velocity, another critical parameter which could not be addressed in our unanesthetized rats using the current setup.",

The MI group mimics a heart failure model of AF substrate formation. Thus, the observed correlations between the AF substrate parameters and atrial fibrosis or LV systolic dysfunction in this group are to be expected 36 . In contrast, the large variance in the developed AF substrate of the Aldo group as well as the absence of correlation between the AF substrate and the level of LA fibrosis are surprising. High Aldo states have been associated with increased prevalence of AF and experimental results also indicate increased density of its receptors in the fibrillating atria [37] [38] [39] [40] . Aldo promotes atrial fibrosis and blockade of its receptors can efficiently block this effect 37, [41] [42] [43] [44] . Interestingly, while excessive Aldo promotes AF substrate locally in the atria, its systemic effects can promote insulin resistance, resistant hypertension, tissue generation of oxygen free radicals and systemic inflammation 45 . Thus, the involvement of Aldo in the pathogenesis of AF might comprise complex interactions between local and systemic effects. In rats Reil et al. 26 , demonstrated that 8 W of exposure to Aldo causes atrial fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and conduction disturbances. However, their ex-vivo EP studies did not identify AERP changes following exposure to Aldo and the authors concluded that fibrosis leading to decreased conduction velocity is the main factor promoting AF substrate. In contrast Lammers et al. 29 , did identify action potential duration shortening following 4 W of exposure to Aldo, which was associated with increased expression of Kir2.1 and Kv1.5 potassium channels in isolated atria of the Aldo-treated rats. Our current findings strongly suggest that although atrial fibrosis is indeed a uniform finding in Aldo-treated rats, factors other than fibrosis probably contribute to the development of AF substrate. Nevertheless, our current study was not specifically designed to mechanistically address this issue and further insights on this important issue will have to await future analysis.",

This intriguing finding led us to several additional experiments in order to try to reveal possible source\\s for this phenomenon. The results strongly argue against the involvement of systemic inflammation as an underlying mechanism based on direct serum measurements of inflammatory cytokines as well as the absence of atrial fibrosis which is expected to occur in the presence of systemic inflammation 31, 32, 46 . Post-operative AF due to the thoracotomy we performed in the implantation surgery is another option that should be considered. However, post-operative AF typically demonstrate peak incidence between days 2 and 4 after surgery and frequent recurrences, especially during the first postoperative week 47 . This time course in in clear contrast with the very low AF burden that we consistently encountered 1 W post-op, which gradually developed and increased over time. Thus, although we cannot totally exclude this option, the kinetics of AF development in the Sham animals makes this possibility quite unlikely.",

Anxiety\\depression related to chronic social isolation is a well know phenomenon in rodents including rats 33, 49 . Thus, we invested substantial effort in delineating the possible role of social isolation as a cause for the intrinsic AF substrate. Using a simple manipulation allowing socially rewarding interaction between rats through a mesh barrier 34 , we confirmed a substantial reduction in anxiety\\ depression. However, we found that this inhibition of anxiety\\depression slightly augmented rather than reduced the developed AF substrate. The possible mechanism\\s of this augmentation can only be speculated and require further and more detailed characterization in future studies. Nonetheless, our data can unequivocally rule out the possibility that chronic social isolation may have a causative roll in the intrinsic AF substrate development of rats implanted with our MBHE system.",

While, the new electrode was highly effective in EP terms, it did not prevent the progressive development of AF substrate over time. It is possible that the local injury induced by the delicate stainless steel pins of the new MBHE is enough to cause some non-uniform conduction leading to AF substrate formation. However, the gradual development of the substrate over a period of many weeks is somewhat inconsistent with this option. Another possibility is that the local load of the implanted electrode on the contracting RA caused stretch related remodeling over time 50 . Sterile pericarditis due to local removal of the RA pericardium is another option that should be considered. In any case, on a practical level it appears that the intrinsic AF substrate that we characterized here is unavoidable under the current conditions and should be taken into consideration in any future study utilizing this or similar system for mechanistic or pharmacological studies of the AF substrate in rats.",

The MBHE is implanted on the RA for atrial pacing (yellow arrow). Peripheral ECG and ground poles are implanted subcutaneously (grey & green arrows). Signal from one pole of the MBHE recorded against an ECG pole (Atrial-unipolar) is used to acquire high resolution readings of the atrial activity. A shielding ring (orange arrow) with four plastic restraints is used to prevent extraction of the device over time. (B) Side view and upper view of the shielding ring over the back connector. After implantation, the ring is inserted over the connector, sutured to the skin and glued to the connector over four plastic restraints. (C) An implanted rat ambulatory in the cage between the electrophysiological studies. (D) An implanted rat connected to the pacing & recording apparatus for AF substrate evaluation. Recording amplifiers and pacers are connected to the rat through commutator and flexible electrical cable (arrow). The rat has free access to food and water. (E) Recording of an AF episode triggered by burst pacing. Left: Baseline ECG and atrial-unipolar recordings. Middle: a standard AF triggering burst (20Sec, 100 Hz, double threshold).
