In that setting the domain \u2126 \u2282 R 2 represents the area of an image whose grey values f are known only in some subset K \u2282 \u2126 and the goal of the inpainting problem is to recover the complete image by filling in the missing information at G := \u2126\u2212K. The diffusion tensor D : R 2 \u2192 R 2\u00d72 depends on the gradient of a Gaussian-smoothed version of u, denoted u \u03c3 , and is usually designed in order to steer the diffusion process in such a way that important geometrical information is taken into account. The Dirichlet boundary condition (2) , on the other hand, enforces the inpainted result u to be coherent with the known data f at the boundary of the known data region \u2202K.

            "text": "EED inpainting. The choice of the ellipticity condition (4) covers the inpainting problem with Edge-Enhancing Diffusion (EED) [11, 13, 4] . In that setting the diffusion tensor is such that the differential operator encourages diffusion along edges over diffusion across edges. More precisely, D(\u2207u \u03c3 ) is defined as a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix with eigenvectors \u2207u \u22a5 \u03c3 and \u2207u \u03c3 having as corresponding eigenvalues 1 and g(|\u2207u \u03c3 | 2 ), where g is the Charbonnier diffusivity [3] given by g(s) := (1 + s 2 /\u03bb 2 ) \u2212 1 2 . For the rest of this work we also assume w.l.o.g. that \u03bb = 1 except when stated explicitly otherwise. Edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion was first proposed as a parabolic evolution process for denoising [11] , where it can be regarded as an anisotropic alternative to isotropic regularisations [2] of the Perona-Malik filter [9] . This evolution has been shown to be well-posed in the continuous, space discrete, and fully discrete setting [12] . Later on, the elliptic steady state equation of EED has been supplemented with Dirichlet data and used for inpainting missing regions in matrix-valued images [13] . Its main application today is inpainting-based lossy image compression, where only a sparse, carefully optimised subset of the data is stored and the missing data are recovered by EED inpainting [4] . In this context, experiments have shown that EED gives state-of-the-art results that outperform other partial differential equations in terms of reconstruction quality [10] . Fig. 1 depicts an example for EED inpainting of sparse data, using a photo of Professor Nina Uraltseva. In spite of its qualities in practical applications, there is no existence theory for EED inpainting so far. Our paper closes this gap. . Middle: Selecting 10 % of the data with the probabilistic sparsification strategy from [7] . These data locations specify the set K. Right: Reconstruction from the sparsified data using a finite difference scheme for the EED inpainting model with \u03bb = 1 and \u03c3 = 0.8.",

Our paper is organised as follows: Section 2 covers the existence of a solution for (1)-(3). We apply the Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem [5, 6] in order to show the existence of at least one weak solution which corresponds to a fixed point of an appropriate operator. In Section 3 we show that the set of possibly multiple weak solutions is bounded and can be characterised as the minimisers of an appropriate functional. Finally, in Section 4 we study the behaviour of sequences obtained by iteratively applying the operator used in the existence theory. We show that under some conditions these sequences are bounded and hence contain convergent subsequences. Appendix A lists some auxiliary results.",

As a result, it is even not clear whether we have uniform estimates in the class W 1,1 . Our approach in this direction is sketched in Section 4.1.1, where the basic inequality (69) is iterated and leads to a combination of convergent series, provided that a suitable smallness condition holds true. Note that we do not have to establish regularity results on the Neumann part of the boundary, since we localize the mollification procedure under consideration. In Section 4.1.2 we then restrict the operator T to a set M of uniform local W 1,1 -bounds, T : M \u2192 M. The existence of fixed points of the iterated operators T n now follows by familiar Leray-Schauder arguments. This provides the background for investigating an iteration of T as a numerical tool in our considerations. The main difficulty is due to the fact that in general (even after passing to suitable subsequences)",
