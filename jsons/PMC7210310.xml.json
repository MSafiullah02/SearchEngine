The prefusion conformation of Env trimer is the state recognized by most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)5\u20137, and thus considered a major vaccine target.

Other cryo-EM structures of detergent-solubilized Env constructs with or without the CT has been reported14\u201316, but the MPER, TMD, and CT regions are all disordered in detergent micelles that probably failed to mimic a real membrane. We have recently determined the NMR structures of the trimeric MPER and TMD reconstituted in bicelles that mimic a lipid bilayer8,9. In particular, the MPER matches well the low-resolution cryo-ET density near the membrane of the unliganded viral Env, suggesting the MPER conformation observed by NMR is consistent with the structure of prefusion Env on the virion9.",

The HIV-1 Env CT can be divided into distinct regions based on their biophysical properties (Supplementary Fig. 1a): a loop, commonly known as the Kennedy sequence (KS), followed by three segments predicted to form amphipathic \u03b1-helices, named lentivirus lytic peptide 2 (LLP2), LLP3, and LLP117. Earlier studies suggested that the CT forms three membrane-bound amphipathic helices in an extended conformation19,20. These structures are very informative about the secondary structures of the CT, but they fall short of explaining how truncation in the CT can influence the antigenic structure of the ectodomain on the opposite side of the membrane5,21,22. In this study, we used NMR to obtain high-resolution information of the HIV-1 Env CT folding in the context of the TMD and lipid bilayer. We find that the CT adopts a structure different from the previous model19 that can explain the physical coupling between the CT and the ectodomain.",

We first mutated the palmitoylation site C764 to serine (C764S) to avoid non-physiological disulfide formation. We then found that the KS (residues 710\u2013738) was completely unstructured according to the NMR data and that removal of its central region (residues 726\u2013736) did not affect the protein structure (Supplementary Fig. 2). This region was thus deleted to reduce NMR signal overlap. The final NMR construct, designated TMD\u2013CTLLP2, included residues 677\u2013725 and 737\u2013788. TMD\u2013CTLLP2 is trimeric in DMPC\u2013DHPC bicelles with q = 0.5 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Comparison of the NMR spectrum of the bicelle-reconstituted TMD\u2013CTLLP2 with those of the MPER\u2013TMD (residues 660\u2013710)9 and the TMD (residues 677\u2013716)8 used in previous studies showed that the peaks corresponding to the TM core (residues 685\u2013700) are almost superimposable (Supplementary Figs. 1c and 3a), indicating that its structure is essentially identical in all three overlapping constructs. Therefore, the CT did not disrupt the TMD structure.",

One is the inter-chain proton\u2013proton distance, derived from nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) using previously established protocols9,23 (see the Methods section and Supplementary Fig. 4). The other is the plane restraint (confinement of an assigned atom in a plane)24, derived from NMR-based membrane partition analysis of the protein in bicelles25. The plane restraints are rarely used in NMR structure determination but useful here for constraining the CT segments that reside mostly on the plane of the bicelle. The residue-specific plane restraints were derived by (1) measuring solvent and lipophilic paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) amplitudes along the bicelle normal using the paramagnetic probe titration (PPT) method25, and (2) calibrating the PRE amplitudes against the established structure and membrane partition of the TMD (residues 678\u2013710)8,26 (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5). The final structure of the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 trimer was independently validated by inter-chain PRE analyses of multiple site-directed spin-labeling (Supplementary Fig. 6).",

            "text": "The structure of the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 trimer in bicelles shows a novel membrane protein fold in which the CT winds around the TMD (Fig. 1a). The LLP2 is not a long continuous helix as previously proposed19; instead it forms two helices, designated H1 (residues 741\u2013764) and H2 (residues 769\u2013786), adopting a ring-like structure around the C-terminal region of the TMD trimer. The three H1s make direct contacts with the TMD trimer to form an inner ring around the TMD (Fig. 1a, b). The CT\u2013TMD interactions involve the H1 nonpolar residues (L748 and L755), which form a hydrophobic cluster with TM residues (V701, L704, V705, and V708) of the same chain, and the polar H1 residue D759, which can make a salt bridge with the TM residue R709 of the neighboring chain. These residues thus collectively mediate the specific association between the CT ring and the TMD trimer. Indeed, hydrogen\u2013deuterium (H\u2013D) exchange data confirmed that residues 704\u2013706, which showed fast H\u2013D exchange in the TMD construct26, are protected in the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 sample, as expected (Supplementary Fig. 7). The three H2s fold around the inner ring at its periphery (Fig. 1a, c). This folding appears to be driven mainly by hydrophobic interactions involving H2 residues (V778, I781, and V782) of one chain and H1 residues (I746 and V749) of the neighboring chain. Based on the membrane partition data (Fig. 1d), H1s and H2s all reside in the headgroup region of the lipid bilayer. The palmitoylation site C764 (S764 in this construct) faces the lipid bilayer interior, consistent with its role in anchoring the LLP2 to the membrane.",

As such, we merged the NMR restraints from the three samples and constructed a model of the MPER\u2013TMD\u2013CTLLP2 (residues 660\u2013788) (Fig. 1d, e) in the context of lipid bilayer, as described in the Methods section.

When reconstituted in bicelles, the CTLLP2 did not trimerize according to the OG-label analysis27 (Supplementary Fig. 9a). In contrast, when reconstituted in the presence of the TMD\u2013KS, the CTLLP2 trimerized (Supplementary Fig. 9b) and folded around the TMD as shown by the PRE analysis (Fig. 2). In addition, to evaluate the structural impact of weakening the interaction between CT and TMD, we introduced five mutations in the CT H1 including L748S, L755S, D758A, D759A, and S762A. The mutant (designated CT2-tmd, also used in the antigenicity studies below) appeared to have maintained the overall trimeric structure of the wild type in bicelles as the NMR resonances of the TMD and H2 did not change significantly (Fig. 3a). The conformational stability of the mutant was examined by inter-chain PRE analysis, as was done in Supplementary Fig. 6b. Comparison of residue-specific PREs to that measured under identical condition for the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 showed that the TMD PRE values of the mutant were reduced by as much as 30% (Fig. 3b). Since the two samples carried the same spin-label at C764, the results indicate that the H1 mutations above indeed had weaken the CT\u2013TMD interaction and probably loosened the CT baseplate. The above independent experiments collectively suggest that the specific TMD\u2013CT interactions drive spontaneous formation of the CT ring around the TMD.",

With the new CT structural information, we now probe this effect with CT mutations designed to disrupt CT\u2013TMD or CT\u2013CT interactions shown in Fig. 1. The effect of the mutations on the antigenic structure of the Env ectodomain was evaluated by a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay31, using bnAbs VRC01 (CD4 binding site)32, PG9, PG16, and PGT145 (trimer-specific)33,34, as well as non-neutralizing or strain-specific neutralizing antibodies, including b6 (CD4 binding site)32, 3791 (V3)35, and 17b (CD4-induced)36 (mutant list and results in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively; epitope mapping is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10). Although virus neutralization is not a direct measure of antibody binding to the Env as the process could be influenced by other factors such as possible CT-matrix protein (MA) interaction and membrane fusion kinetics, earlier studies have shown that loss of neutralization is overall correlated with the loss of Env binding to bnAbs5,37. We generated 28 Env mutants using the sequence of a clade A isolate 92UG037.8, and we further characterized 11 of them (indicated in Supplementary Table 1) which showed significant phenotype in the antibody neutralization assay. When expressed in 293T cells, these mutants produced comparable levels of Env, with similar extents of cleavage between gp120 and gp41 (Supplementary Fig. 11). In particular, none of these mutations in the CT region have led to dramatic increase in cell-surface levels (Supplementary Fig. 12). At a low Env expression level to mimic the low surface density on HIV-1 virions38, only the mutant TMD-ct showed a moderate reduction in cell\u2013cell fusion activity, but still at ~50% of that of the wild-type Env (Supplementary Fig. 13a). At a high Env expression level, the fusion activity of all the mutants was essentially indistinguishable from that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig. 13b), suggesting the high cell-surface density of Env can compensate for defects in membrane fusion caused by the CT mutations, as observed for mutations in the TMD and MPER previously8,9. When these mutations were introduced into pseudoviruses, there were moderate changes in Env incorporation for mutants V749K and A756N, and in processing for those with large-scale mutations, including the mutant TMD-ct (Supplementary Fig. 14), consistent with the role of the CT in Env incorporation39. In addition, the mutant F774N showed substantially increased viral infectivity (165%) while the rest of mutants have impaired infectivity, ranging from 10 to 63% of that of the wild-type Env, suggesting that the CT can both positively and negatively modulate the efficiency of viral entry (Supplementary Fig. 15).",

The single mutants all showed neutralization patterns very similar to that of wild-type Env (Supplementary Fig. 16). Among the four double mutants, the two containing D759R showed minor but noticeable reduction (~20%) in sensitivity to the trimer-specific bnAbs. The triple mutant (L702S-A756N-D759R) showed very significant resistance (~40%) to the trimer-specific bnAbs, especially for PG9 and PGT145 (Fig. 4b). These results suggest the important role of D759 in interacting with either R709 or N706 of the TMD (Fig. 1b), while underlining the nature of the CT structure being resistant to small changes. Larger scale mutagenesis of the CT\u2013TMD interface resulted in mutants consistently less sensitive to the trimer-specific bnAbs, but remained totally resistant to the non-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 16). As a negative control, the mutant (A756N-L760S-L763N-C764E), containing mutations on the other side of the H1 helix, did not show any phenotype (Fig. 4d). Finally, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity swapping of the key TMD residues in the CT\u2013TMD interface generated a mutant (TMD-ct) that, while still sensitive to VRC01, was completely resistant to the trimer-specific bnAbs and also substantially sensitive to b6, 3791, and 17b (Fig. 4e). These results suggest that disrupting the packing interface between the TMD and CT can destabilize the Env ectodomain and shift it to an open conformation10,40,41, further supporting our previous notion that the CT can modulate the antigenic structure of the Env trimer5.",

As expected, the TMD-ct mutant became much more sensitive to the HIV+ chronic sera than the wild type, consistent with an open Env conformation and the tier-1 phenotype42, while the two intermediate mutants were similar to the WT in the tier phenotype probably due to limited local changes near the trimer apex. We also tested additional bnAbs that target epitopes in CD4bs (binding site), V3-glycan, V1/V2-glycan, gp120/gp41 interface, and the MPER (Supplementary Table 4). While the wild-type and mutant viruses showed no major differences in sensitivity to most of these bnAbs, the mutants were ~10-times more sensitive to the MPER-directed antibody 4E10 than the wild-type virus, suggesting that the mutations in the CT and/or TM regions significantly alter the MPER structure.",

We thus examined backbone dynamics across the TM in the MPER\u2013TMD and TMD\u2013CTLLP2 constructs by measuring the product of NMR 15N R1 and R2 relaxation rates, R1R2, which is a probe for relative ms\u2013\u03bcs motion associated with conformational exchange43. The MPER\u2013TMD shows significantly higher dynamics in the MPER and C-terminal region of the TMD than the hydrophobic core of the TMD (residues 686\u2013689), suggesting that both ends are unconstrained (Fig. 5a). We then locked the MPER by introducing the L660C and A667C mutations, which are positioned to form inter-chain disulfide in the MPER prefusion structure (Supplementary Fig. 17a). Locking the MPER resulted in substantially reduced motion not only in the MPER, as expected, but also in the C-terminal region of the TMD at the opposite side of the membrane; no change in the TMD hydrophobic core (Fig. 5a). Similar effects are observed in the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 where the R1R2 values for the TMD C-terminal region are less than that of the unlocked MPER\u2013TMD (Fig. 5a). These data suggest that the three TM helices undergo a \u201cscissor-like\u201d movement around the hydrophobic core (or the hinge), at which the trimer remains tightly associated as shown by H\u2013D exchange analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 and ref. 26), and that constraining either N- or C- terminal end of the TM helix with locked MPER or CT, respectively, can affect the opposite end of the TMD. Therefore, disruption or deletion of the CT baseplate can in principle destabilize the MPER structure via the TMD (Fig. 5b). Since the MPER is a control relay that modulates the ectodomain conformation and antigenic properties9, the CT-MPER coupling is also expected to shift conformational equilibria of the ectodomain and alter its antibody binding profile.",

The other two LLP segments (LLP3 and LLP1) of the CT can also form amphipathic helices19 and we suggest that they may fold around the LLP2 ring to further expand the baseplate (Fig. 5b). This model provides a structural explanation for our previous observations that progressive truncations of the CT incrementally reduced sensitivity of the Env ectodomain to PG16-like bnAbs, and that the effect reached maximum after the complete deletion of the LLP25, as progressive truncations of the CT would gradually weaken the base support for the TMD. Indeed, our data on the co-refolding of the TMD\u2013KS and CTLLP2 fragments show that the interaction between H1 and TMD is critical to the proper formation of the baseplate and possibly to the structural integrity of the entire Env. It is unclear whether the CT baseplate is relevant to viral entry.

Our NMR dynamics study of the MPER\u2013TMD and TMD\u2013CTLLP2 fragments in bicelles provided compelling data suggesting physical coupling between the MPER and CT. The observation that locking the MPER with inter-chain disulfides reduced dynamics of the C-terminal end of the TMD ~50 residues away suggests that the proposed cross-membrane coupling of the Env is entirely possible by structural consideration. It was somewhat surprising that TMD C-terminal end showed slightly more dynamics in the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 than in the locked MPER\u2013TMD, because we thought CT\u2013TMD interaction may impose a more direct constraint on the TMD motion. Nevertheless, this result is not inconsistent with the proposed model in Fig. 5. Comparing to the unlocked MPER\u2013TMD, the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 construct indeed showed reduced dynamics at the C-terminal end of the TMD, although the CT\u2013TMD interaction still may not produce an effect as strong as covalently locking the MPER. The key message from the dynamics data is that the pivotal or the scissor-like motion of the TMD can be modulated by either MPER or CT.",

Structural definition of the prefusion Env trimer at high resolution, which can provide a useful tool to facilitate immunogen selection and design, has limitations due to artificial modifications, extra ligands required for stability or the absence of membrane, compounded by observations with other spectroscopic approaches, such as single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and double electron\u2013electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy50\u201352.

The small Ig-fold protein named GB1 (MW = 8.4 kDa) has been proven to serve as the SCP very effectively. A TriNTA molecule is linked via PEG-2-SMCC (succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) to the N-terminus of GB1, while a His6-tag is added to the C-terminus of the oligomeric protein, so that the TriNTA-GB1 conjugate can strongly attach to the protomer (the binding affinity of TriNTA to His6-tag is 20 \u00b1 10 nM). The GB1s are then cross-linked to report the oligomeric state of the protein, as the local concentration of stoichiometric amount of GB1 to the oligomer allows for more efficient cross-linking than for the free GB1 in solution.

The His6-tagged proteins were expressed, purified and reconstituted in bicelles (q = 0.5) as previously described, except the sample buffer was a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for better cross-linking efficiency. To prevent unwanted cross-linking between the membrane protein and GB1, all the free primary amines of TMD\u2013CTLLP2, CTLLP2, or TMD\u2013KS were blocked by reacting with 100-fold molar excess of Sulfo-NHS acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Excess Sulfo-NHS acetate was removed by dialysis while tightly controlling the bicelle q. After dialysis, the samples were concentrated to 40 \u03bcM and mixed with 60 \u03bcM TriNTA-GB1 to ensure that all the His6-tags were saturated with TriNTA-GB1.

Assigning inter-chain distance restraints, however, faced the challenge of measuring NOEs between structurally equivalent protomers having the same chemical shifts. To overcome this problem, we used a mixed sample in which half of the protomers were 15N, 2H-labeled and the other half 13C-labeled. Recording a 3D 15N-edited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC (\u03c4mix = 200 ms) on this sample allowed identification of NOEs exclusively between the 15N-attached protons of one protomer and the aliphatic protons of the neighboring one. The identified NOEs were unambiguously confirmed by performing the 3D JCH-modulated NOE experiment9,23, in which two interleaved NOESY spectra were recorded with varying the JCH evolution (JCH = 0 ms and JCH = 8 ms) before the NOE mixing. Subtraction of the two spectra allowed selection of only the inter-chain NOEs. Finally, a control sample containing only (15N, 2H)-labeled protein was used to perform an identical 3D 15N-edited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC experiment as done for the mixed sample above (note: the 15N, 2H-labeled TMD\u2013CTLLP2 in the mixed and control samples were from the same protein expression batch). Comparison of the mixed and control spectra provided another confirmation that the detected inter-chain NOEs were due to the mixing of protomers with different labeling schemes and not to residual protonation. This assignment strategy is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 4, where several examples of unambiguously assigned inter-chain NOEs are shown.",

As previously shown, DMPC/DHPC bicelle with sufficiently large q (\u22650.5) allows direct use of measurable paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) to probe residue-specific immersion depth of the protein in the bilayer region of the bicelle. Two PPT analyses were performed: titrating the bicelle-reconstituted TMD\u2013CTLLP2 with (1) the soluble paramagnetic agent Gd-DOTA, and (2) the lipophilic paramagnetic agent 16-Doxyl-stearic acid (16-DSA). The titrants were taken from concentrated stock solutions (600 mM Gd-DOTA and 24 mM 16-DSA) in the same buffer as that of the protein sample and were added in small aliquots (few \u03bcL per step) to minimize sample dilution. The PRE increase was monitored by recording a 2D 1H\u201315N TROSY-HSQC spectrum at each of the titrant concentrations: 0 (reference), 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 mM for Gd-DOTA; 0 (reference), 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, 3.0, 3.6, and 4.2 mM for 16-DSA.

The mutant proteins were prepared as in the \u201cProtein expression and purification\u201d section above. After reconstitution in bicelles under reducing conditions, DTT was removed from the samples by dialysis at low pH (6.2). The pH was then rapidly raised to 7.4 and 100 mM MTSL (in DMSO) was added to a final ratio of 10:1 (MTSL to Cys-mutant TMD\u2013CTLLP2) and allowed to react at room temperature overnight. Excess MTSL was removed by extensive dialysis (pH 6.7). The samples were then concentrated to 360 \u03bcL for NMR measurements. During the entire sample preparation, MTSL-containing solutions were shielded from light. As a negative control, a sample containing only (15N, 85% 2H)-labeled TMD\u2013CTLLP2 (without Cys) was prepared using the same MTSL-labeling procedure used for the mixed samples, to ensure that free MTSL removal with our protocol was complete (Supplementary Fig. 6d). To quantify the PREs, defined as the ratio of the peak intensities in the paramagnetic (I) and diamagnetic state (I0), a 2D 1H\u201315N TROSY-HSQC spectrum was recorded before and after reducing the spin-label by addition of 20 mM sodium ascorbate (pH 6.7).",

Provided that the bicelle is sufficiently large (q \u2265 0.5), the PPT method allows to determine the projection of each amide proton (rZ) along the protein C3 symmetry axis, which is also parallel to the bicelle normal and aligned to the Cartesian Z axis for convenience. Therefore, rZ can be assigned as residue-specific plane restraint if the PREamp values are calibrated against a known structure with known membrane partition. Since the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 and the TMD show remarkable chemical shift and structure similarity for residues 677\u2013710 (Supplementary Figs. 1c, 3a, and 8), this region was used to calibrate the PREamp values of the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 (from both Gd-DOTA and 16-DSA) against the previously established structure and membrane partition of the TMD8,26 (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Specifically, we generated the PREamp vs. rZ plot for residues 679\u2013710 using the residue-specific PREamp from the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 and the known rZ from the known TMD structure. The data were then fitted to the sigmoidal function (Eq. (2)) to yield parameterized Eq. 2 for Gd-DOTA and 16-DSA, which were then used to determine rZ for the other residues of the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 not used for the calibration (711\u2013788). Out of the calculated rZ, only those in the sensitive region of the sigmoidal curves were retained. Finally, rZ derived from Gd-DOTA and 16-DSA data sets were averaged and merged into one single data set, yielding the final set of plane restraints. The plane restraints used for the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 structure calculation included rZ from the published TMD structure (residues 679\u2013-710) and the newly calculated rZ for residues 711\u2013788, with an uncertainty of \u00b11 \u00c5.",

Since the TMD\u2013CTLLP2 (677\u2013788) is an extension of the previously studied TMD (677\u2013716) and both constructs exhibit almost identical chemical shift for residues 677\u2013710 (Supplementary Figs. 1c, 3a, and 8), we used the structure of the TMD8 as a starting point for the new calculation. To implement this strategy, we first performed TALOS+59 analysis using the assigned backbone chemical shift values (15N, 13C\u03b1, 13C\u03b2, and 13C\u02b9), and then used the \u201cGOOD\u201d dihedral angles generated by TALOS+ to build a secondary structural model of the TMD\u2013CTLLP2. Second, we assembled a trimer using the previously assigned NOE restraints for residues 677\u2013702 (from PDB accession code 5JYN). Finally, we applied the newly assigned inter-chain restraints (most of them from residues 704\u2013785) to complete the trimer of the TMD\u2013CTLLP2. For each inter-chain restraint between two adjacent protomers, three identical distance restraints were assigned respectively to all pairs of neighboring protomers to satisfy the condition of C3 symmetry. The assembled trimer was then refined against the complete set of NOE restraints (intra- and inter-chain) and dihedral angles using a simulated annealing (SA) protocol in which the temperature was lowered from 1000 to 200 K in steps of 50 K. The NOE restraints were enforced by flat-well harmonic potentials, with the force constant ramped from 2 to 40 kcal/mol \u00c5\u22122 during annealing. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were enforced by flat-well (\u00b1 the corresponding uncertainties from TALOS+) harmonic potential with force constant ramped from 10 to 1000 kcal/mol rad\u22122. The plane restraints were fixed in space and enforced by flat-well (\u00b11 \u00c5) harmonic potentials, with force constant ramped from 1 to 5 kcal/mol \u00c5\u22122 during annealing.

Upon interaction, the TMD\u2013KS is expected to experience PRE generated by the CTLLP2 spin-label. b Residue-specific PRE (I/I0) of (15N, 85% 2H)-labeled TMD\u2013KS mixed with MTSL-labeled CTLLP2 (left). Error bars represent the uncertainty derived from cross-peaks signal to noise. Missing bars are due to prolines (indicated by gray triangles) or overlapping residues. The horizontal dash lines mark the four PRE regimes used to map the PREs onto the protein structure (right). The TMD\u2013KS and the CTLLP2 are shown as white ribbons and blue cylinders, respectively. c Labeling scheme for probing intermolecular CTLLP2\u2013CTLLP2 interaction. CTLLP2 (white) is isotopically-enriched for NMR readout while CTLLP2 (blue) carries the spin-label at C789, and TMD\u2013KS (green) serves as scaffold. After purification, the three proteins are mixed at ~1:2:3 molar ratio, respectively, and co-reconstituted in bicelles. d Residue-specific PRE (I/I0) of (15N, 85% 2H)-labeled CTLLP2 mixed with MTSL-labeled CTLLP2 and scaffold TMD\u2013KS (left). Error bars represent the uncertainty derived from cross-peaks signal to noise. Missing bars are due to overlapping residues.

The yellow box highlights the decrease of R1R2 in the C-terminal part of the TMD due to locking the MPER or CT presence. b Proposed mechanism of CT-ectodomain coupling mediated by the TMD. For simplicity, only two chains of the trimer are illustrated. Left: the CT baseplate confines the TMD motion, important for stabilizing the Env trimer in the prefusion state. Right: deletion of the CT baseplate or disruption of CT\u2013TMD interactions allows greater TMD hinge motion, destabilizing the MPER, which in turn modulates the antigenic structure of the ectodomain.
