            "text": "Toroviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a pleomorphic virion morphology. The first report on toroviruses described the identification of an unclassified virus from diarrheic calves (Woode et al., 1982), now designated as the Breda virus (BRV), or bovine torovirus (BoTV), two serotypes of which have been identified (BoTV-1 and BoTV-2). The virus is endemic in cattle herds, with asymptomatic cows possibly acting as reservoirs. Newborn calves generally develop symptoms of diarrhea, typically lasting 2\u201313 days (Koopmans et al., 1990, Koopmans et al., 1991) and BoTV has been commonly recovered from calves with diarrhea (Duckmanton et al., 1998a, Duckmanton et al., 1998b, Hoet et al., 2003a, Hoet et al., 2003b). Infection with BoTV has also been conclusively associated with diarrhea in veal calves (Hoet et al., 2003a, Hoet et al., 2003b). Interestingly, BoTV has been reported as well in nasal secretions, and may therefore be able to infect both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract (Hoet et al., 2002), as is the case with some coronaviruses (Lai and Holmes, 2001), including the SARS coronavirus (Leung et al., 2003). The equine torovirus (EqTV), or Berne virus (BEV), has been designated as the genus prototype; it can be grown in cell culture (unlike BoTV) and consequently is better characterized. Despite the presence of anti-EqTV antibodies in horses, no disease has been firmly associated with EqTV infection. Toroviruses have also been reported in humans with gastroenteritis (Beards et al., 1984, Duckmanton et al., 1997, Jamieson et al., 1998) and pigs (Kroneman et al., 1998, Smits et al., 2003). Antibodies reacting against BoTV and EqTV antigens have been detected in various other mammals, suggesting toroviruses may be widespread (Brown et al., 1987, Weiss et al., 1984).",

Approximately 16 kb of sequence from the 3\u2032 end of the genome, and approximately 1.5 kb from the 5\u2032 end of genome have been determined. These sequence data have revealed the basic torovirus genome organization and the presence of conserved replicase domains(Snijder and Horzinek, 1993). These findings were instrumental in the revision of the Coronaviridae taxon to include the genus Torovirus, as well as the creation of the order Nidovirales which currently includes the families Coronaviridae (comprising two genera, Coronavirus and Torovirus), Arteriviridae and Roniviridae (Cavanagh, 1997, Cavanagh et al., 1994, Cavanagh and Horzinek, 1993, Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003). The complete genome sequence of EqTV has yet to be published, although Smits et al. (2003) reported the completion of the EqTV genome sequence in a recent study of torovirus field variants. The published sequence of BoTV is limited to that of the structural genes, which account for approximately 7.5 kb of the 3\u2032 end of the genome (Cornelissen et al., 1997, Duckmanton et al., 1998a, Duckmanton et al., 1998b). Consequently, the genus Torovirus remains the only genus within the order Nidovirales without a representative complete genome sequence.",

Primer names, sequences, and positions within the BoTV-1 genome are given in Table 1\n. One primer, APPR-RS, was designed within a conserved region of the coronavirus open reading frame (ORF) 1a of the replicase gene. This region was first identified by ORF1a amino acid alignment, followed by the corresponding nucleotide alignment of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), GenBank accession no.

Alignments were done using ClustalX 1.8 (Thompson et al., 1997). The sequence of the APPR-RS primer was based on the consensus sequence of the nucleotide alignment described above. The EEAT7 primer used in the amplification of the 3\u2032 non-coding region (3\u2032 NC) is a coxsackie virus B6 specific primer (Martino et al., 1999). The complementary sequence of the first 21 nucleotides (3\u2032\u20135\u2032) of this primer were incorporated into the BRE-3\u2032NC-CVB6 primer used in the reverse transcription reaction. Lastly, the AAP-CVB6 primer used in the 5\u2032 RACE PCR reaction was designed to bind within the poly(A) of the cDNA transcripts, and contained sequence complementary to the 3\u2032 end of the EEAT7 primer, allowing for the option of using EEAT7 in a reamplification of 1st round PCR products.",

The mixture was aliquoted in a thin-walled PCR tube (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and overlaid with 40 \u03bcl of molecular grade mineral oil (Sigma). The master mix was transferred to a room dedicated for cDNA synthesis where 2 \u03bcl of the RT (or dilution) was added under the oil and the reaction tube was transferred to a Robocycler thermal cycler (Stratagene) in another room.

For 2nd round PCR where the template used was an amplicon purified from an agarose gel, only the ddH2O was adjusted, to bring the final reaction volume to 50 \u03bcl. The RT protocol was modified for amplicon J, using the RT primer listed in Table 1, primer set 10. After thawing on ice, the 2.5 \u03bcl aliquot of primer was added to the RNA and the mixture was heated at 99 \u00b0C for 5 min (Kostouros et al., 2003); the remainder of the reaction was carried out according to the protocol above.",

A stretch of seven thymidine residues (27,715\u201327,721), as opposed to eight in the previously reported sequence, is responsible for this difference. This resulted in a shift of the ORF leading to extension of the gene and protein sequence. The sequences of several BoTV isolates characterized by Smits et al. (2003) are in agreement with the length of the HE gene/protein sequence reported here. Of the six isolates sequenced within the structural genes, four of these had HE genes of 1260 nts, identical to what is reported here. The other two isolates contained HE genes shorter by only 3 nts, although the structural genes were identified as having undergone recombination with a porcine torovirus resulting in an HE gene of mixed origin (Smits et al., 2003).",

Therefore, it is not surprising that similar potential secondary structures were identified in the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap, and the same conserved domains of ORF1b identified in EqTV and other nidoviruses were also found in BoTV ORF1b (Snijder et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 1990).",

This ORF encodes a protein of 4445 aa (pp1a), larger than the pp1a of the majority of the coronaviruses, with the sole exception of the 4470 aa MHV pp1a. The pp1a of the nidoviruses also contain conserved domains with functions important to viral replication. All nidoviruses studied to date contain at least one protease domain within pp1a, known as the \u2018main\u2019 protease or 3C-like protease (3CLP), after the picornaviruses 3C protease, and located within the C terminus of the pp1a protein (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). Although all of the nidoviruses possess this domain, the protease is slightly different in each family. The coronavirus 3CLP contains a cysteine as its catalytic nucleophile, but does not appear to contain an acidic residue common to the catalytic triad, His-Asp(Glu)-Cys, found in this family of proteases (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The 3CLP of the gill associated virus (GAV), genus Oakavirus, family Roniviridae, is also a cysteine protease and like the coronavirus 3CLP, possesses a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Ziebuhr et al., 2003). Finally, the arterivirus main protease is referred to as a 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP) due to the presence of a serine nucleophile in the triad His-Asp-Ser, more common in the cellular homologues, such as the pancreatic enzyme chymotrypsin (Snijder et al., 1996). It was, therefore, surprising to find that the main protease of BoTV appears to be a serine protease, similar to the arterivirus 3CLSP. Repeated attempts at aligning the BoTV sequence with the coronavirus 3C protease failed to provide a convincing alignment. The results presented here were obtained with supporting data from PSI BLAST analysis, the protein sequence alignment shown in Fig. 5A, and secondary structure prediction analysis using the 3D-PSSM protein fold recognition (threading) server that identified the BoTV main protease sequence reported here as having trypsin-like or chymotrypsin-like protease folds.",

A distance matrix is generated from comparison of the predicted proteomes of the viruses, calculating the frequency of short amino acid sequences of a fixed length (K-tuples of amino acids, K being a parameter that can be adjusted in each analysis). Phylogenetic trees can then be built from the distance matrix using standard methods such as the Neighbor Joining (NJ) or Minimum Evolution (ME) methods (Chu et al., 2004, Qi et al., 2004a, Qi et al., 2004b). This method circumvents the difficult, and often impossible task of making alignments of distantly related sequences, and analyzes the entire genomes rather than sections which may have evolved separately. Since we report here the first complete torovirus sequence it is the first time that such an analysis can be done with representatives of all genera in the order Nidovirales (Fig. 6\n). The trees in Fig. 6, calculated using a value of K\n = 5, illustrate a topology only, since calibration of branch lengths in CVTrees present several complications (Qi et al., 2004a, Qi et al., 2004b). Nonetheless, interesting inferences on evolutionary relatedness can be drawn from the topology alone. It is noteworthy to observe that whereas the arteriviruses and the coronaviruses each form a cluster in both trees, BoTV-1 is quite distinct from both clusters in these trees.",

The limited BoTV sequence available for primer design posed a challenge, which was overcome by the use of available sequence from related viruses such as EqTV and the coronaviruses. Using this approach almost 21 kb of novel BoTV-1 sequence was obtained without the benefit of cultured virus. With the availability of the complete genome sequence of BoTV-1, and with more than half of the EqTV genome sequence reported, future studies involving the molecular characterization of other toroviruses should be greatly facilitated. For example, the identification and characterization of the human coronavirus responsible for the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was successful, in part, due to the use of RT-PCR assays targeting conserved domains within ORF1b of the viral replicase gene (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003).",

In that regard, it is remarkable that most differences occur at isolated nucleotides except for a region of 217 nts in the putative bulbous domain (S1) of the spike glycoprotein.

The conservation of these domains within the nidoviruses further emphasizes their significance. The hydrophobic domains in the arteriviruses have been shown to dramatically alter the host-cell membrane architecture in addition to mediating the association of the replication complex with cellular membranes (Pedersen et al., 1999, van der Meer et al., 1998). A similar role can be conjectured in the toroviruses.",

Taking advantage of the BoTV sequence in this study, a new alignment of the RdRp protein sequences was done (data not shown) and the dendrogram obtained was highly similar to that obtained by Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003) but showing the two toroviruses, EqTV and BoTV, clustering together. However, the exact boundaries of the RdRp domains were difficult to establish for many sequences used in the alignment. The availability of the first complete torovirus sequence enabled the establishment of CVTRees with representatives from of all genera within Nidovirales (Fig. 6). The topology of the trees shows that whereas the coronaviruses and the arteriviruses form distinct clusters, in both trees the BoTV-1 sequence stands apart from these clusters. Presently, Coronavirus and Torovirus are two genera within the family Coronaviridae. Viral taxonomy currently uses a polythetic approach which considers numerous properties simultaneously (Condit, 2001). Based on their phylogenetic analysis, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003) proposed that the differences between coronaviruses and toroviruses are large enough that the two genera be elevated to subfamilies or even to families within Nidovirales. The data presented here support further taxonomic separation between the genera Coronavirus and Torovirus.",
