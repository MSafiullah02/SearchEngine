            "text": "Innate immune responses, primarily triggered by interferons (IFNs) and their antiviral effectors, can establish an extremely potent antiviral state to efficiently restrict virus replication and virus-induced pathologies in the susceptible host1. To initiate these innate responses, viruses are detected by the host pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) through recognition of viral molecular signatures known as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)1. PAMPs associated with most viruses include viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is produced as replicative intermediate and single-stranded adenosine/uridine (AU)-rich regions2. These PAMPs effectively activate cascades of signalling events that culminate in the production of IFNs in virus-infected cells. The released IFNs transcriptionally activate hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in uninfected neighbouring cells that instigate direct or indirect antiviral activities3,4. Well-studied examples of these antiviral effectors are dsRNA-activated protein kinase R and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase which bind to dsRNA, and interferon induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)-1 and -5 that bind to 5\u2032-triphosphate containing RNA1,5.",

All members of the IFIT family consist of multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) throughout the length of the protein that are mainly responsible for the protein-protein interaction and assembly of larger protein complexes7,8. Most mammals encode several IFIT genes including IFIT1/ISG56, IFIT2/ISG54, IFIT3/ISG60 and IFIT5/ISG58, however, mice and rats lack IFIT5 and horses lack IFIT16. Amongst all known members of the family, IFIT1 and IFIT5 are highly responsive both at the transcription and translation levels to diverse cellular stresses including those induced by dsRNA, virus infections and lipopolysaccharides1,5. The IFIT proteins family is responsible for diverse array of cellular activities including nucleic acid sensing and direct antiviral effects9. Specifically, IFIT1 is proposed to be a negative-feedback regulator of virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs and cellular antiviral responses10 whereas IFIT5 potentiate antiviral signalling11. Additionally, mammalian IFIT5 can sense and bind to numerous short cellular RNAs such as initiator tRNA, and these interactions are mapped across the protein surface12.",

IFIT5 protein, in addition to IFIT1, discriminates the cellular and viral mRNA for initiating downstream antiviral activities by recognition of discrete features at the 5\u2032 termini7,13. Most eukaryotic cellular ribosomal and transfer RNAs (rRNAs and tRNAs) carry monophosphate at 5\u2032-termini whereas messenger RNAs (mRNAs) bear N7-methlguanosine cap (cap0) attached to the first base through 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge that recruits cellular factors involved in RNA processing and translation initiation14,15. Additionally, in most higher eukaryotes methylation occurs at the 2\u2032-O position of the first or second base yielding the cap1 (m7GpppNmN) or cap2 (m7GpppNmNm) structures, respectively14. Although cap1 and cap2 are not crucial for mRNA translation, human and murine IFIT1 protein can inhibit translation of cap1-lacking mRNA16,17. These features of cellular RNAs are also mimicked by several viruses as countermeasure strategies17. However, viral genomic and subgenomic RNA of negative sense single-stranded viruses such as influenza A viruses (IAV) and Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) bear triphosphate at the 5\u2032-termini14. These PAMPs are sensed by cellular PRRs and initiate innate immune responses, which ultimately restrict virus growth1,5.",

There is limited information available on the repertoires of cellular proteins that recognizes different populations of viral nucleic acid in avian species especially in chickens which differ significantly in mounting innate immune responses and are infected by pathogens that continuously pose zoonotic threats to public health5. Here, we have genetically characterized chicken IFIT and revealed that chickens, in contrast to other vertebrates, encode only one IFIT gene (chIFIT5). The chIFIT5 gene was transcriptionally highly responsive to both type I IFNs and RNA viruses (IAV and NDV) and interestingly this responsiveness was mapped to ISRE motif in the cis-acting elements. We also demonstrated that chIFIT5 specifically interacts with ssRNA carrying 5\u2032-ppp moiety. Through this interaction, chIFIT5 applies strong antiviral activities in lentivirus-transduced stable cell lines whereas CRISPR/Cas9-mediated chIFIT5 knockout promoted virus replication. Finally, employing the RCAS-based retroviral gene transfer vector system20, we generated transgenic chicken embryos expressing chIFIT5 and demonstrated its antiviral potential in ovo. These findings were further evaluated by RCAS-mediated gene silencing in developing transgenic chicken embryos by assessing the replication kinetics of RNA viruses.

In addition, several pseudogenes have been identified in different animal species including IFIT1B (in human, mice and rabbits), IFIT1C (in mice), IFIT3-like (in dogs and mice) and IFIT5-like gene (in dogs and rabbits). To identify corresponding IFIT homologues in chicken, initially several IFIT genes from human and mouse were used in the BLAST algorithm in the Ensembl database.

Since only a single IFIT gene (IFIT5) was identified in the chicken genome, we next examined an approximately 9.0 kb genomic sequence spanning AADN04000218.1 contigs in the chicken chromosome 6 (Chromosome 6: 19,342,835\u201319,429,041). Immediately adjacent to the LIPA gene, a sequence gap was identified whose estimated length was 400 bps in the Ensembl chicken genome build (Ensembl release 85 - July 2016) (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Long primers (Supplementary Table 1) flanking each end of the gap were used to amplify genomic fragments and subsequent sequencing of the products was used to cover the genomic gap. We used the sequenced fragments as input in WebAUGUSTUS and predicted any possible genes in the entire IFIT locus. Only one gene (IFIT5) was predicted in any strand of the input DNA using chicken as species parameters (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The genomic gap has now been filled with the latest Ensembl chicken genome (Ensembl release 87 - Dec 2016) and no gene other than IFIT5 has been identified (until 17 April 2018).",

Complete sequence analysis of the gene revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1440 bps (479 amino acids excluding stop codon) with high sequence identity (48% and 67%) with the human and duck IFIT5 proteins, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The identified gene showed a characteristic exon/intron organization where two exons were separated by a few kilobases (kb) long intron (Fig. 1B). The first exon encodes barely a Kozak sequence (CATG) and 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). The second exon codes the rest of the ORF (1435 bps) and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) for chicken IFIT5 gene. Based on the transcriptomic data from Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV, strain RB1B)-infected CEFs (Fig. 1B) and cDNA sequencing data, a complete IFIT5 gene was annotated. Phylogenetic analysis of characterized chicken (ch) IFIT5 gene with all known human, mouse and duck IFIT genes clustered the chicken gene with duck and human IFIT5 (Fig. 1C). One of the structural hallmarks of all IFIT proteins is the presence of multiple TRP motifs dispersed throughout the length of the protein6,21. The consensus chicken, duck and human IFIT5 sequences were used to predict TRPs using NCBI\u2019s Conserved Domain Database. Both duck and human IFIT5 proteins structurally carried ten TRP motifs and two multi-domains whereas chicken IFIT5 encoded eight predicted and ten structure-based TPRs (Fig. 1D).",

Beside the distribution pattern of mouse IFIT1, no other IFIT proteins have been investigated for their subcellular distributions. To delineate the expression dynamics and sub-cellular distribution, DF-1 cells were transfected with V5-tagged chIFIT5 and transient expression of chIFIT5 was compared in NDV-stimulated or mock-treated cells. Confocal microscopy using anti-V5 antibodies showed that chIFIT5 was exclusively cytoplasmic and was expressed throughout the cytoplasm; however, this expression was concentrated at the cell surface (Fig. 1E, upper panel). We were unable to demonstrate the distribution pattern of chIFIT5 under NDV infection (Fig. 1E, lower panel) probably due to the profound antiviral state induced by chIFIT5 so that infection of NDV in the chIFIT5-expressing cells could not be achieved. It has previously been demonstrated that human IFIT5 enhances the innate immune responses by interacting with RIG-I (not identified in chicken) and MAVS and this interaction occurs at the mitochondria11. Since MAVS localizes on both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes (MEM), we labelled mitochondria and ER in presence of chIFIT5 to assess the distribution and localization of chIFIT5 with MAVS. In DF-1 cells, chIFIT5 localized in close proximity to the mitochondria and no co-localization was observed between ER and chIFIT5 (data not shown). Owing to lack of cross-reactivity of human IFIT5 antibodies and specificity of anti-sera which we have raised against chIFIT5, these experiments were performed using tagged-chIFIT5. Therefore, future studies are required to assess the expression patterns of the endogenous chIFIT5 under virus or non-virus stimuli.",

Different ligands that can either directly induce the transcription of IFIT5 such as IFN-\u03b2 or stimuli that result in the expression of IFNs, which in turn induce the IFIT5 transcription, were assessed (Fig. 2A). TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and TLR3 (poly I:C, synthetic dsRNA) ligands significantly induced the expression of chIFIT5 gene by 25 and 1500 folds, respectively (Fig. 2B). The induction is likely through the activation of IFNs since the chIFN-\u03b2 stimulated cells profoundly increased the transcription of chIFIT5 by 4000 folds compared to untreated or mock-treated cells. There are evidences that negative sense single stranded RNA viruses (e.g. influenza and NDV) produce dsRNA as intermediate by-product during the virus replication cycle2,22\u201324. Therefore, it is plausible that induction of chIFIT5 expression in chicken cells infected with NDV is mediated by virus-generated dsRNA (Fig. 2B). To further assess the temporal effect of NDV infection on the induction of chIFIT5, a time course profiling IFN and IFN-regulated genes was evaluated. The virus-induced expression of chIFIT5 was profoundly observed as early as 2 hours post-infection (Fig. 2C) and the expression was maintained for 4 hours. A slight reduction in IFIT5 expression was observed at 8 hours post-infection (hpi) was reconstituted at 24 hpi (Fig. 2C). This biphasic expression of IFIT5 after virus infection was repeatedly observed in chicken cells. However, the pattern of expression of myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx) gene, which is another well-characterized ISG25, shows a steady up-regulation and peak expression was observed at the latest time post-infection (Fig. 2E). The levels of chIFN-\u03b2 gene induction was proportional to the NDV replication (Fig. 2D), therefore, it can be inferred that the virus-induced expression of chicken IFIT5 is IFN-dependent and that chIFIT5 is an early-ISG with capacity to modulate initial steps of virus life cycle.",

Since our data and previously published transcriptomics studies26 support the profound expression of IFIT5 gene against a wide range of stimuli, we analysed the 5\u2032 flanking region of chIFIT5 gene for motifs that regulate the expression of chIFIT5. In addition to the gene-encoding sequences, approximately 1.2 kb sequence including the putative promoter (Supplementary Fig. 2A) was isolated and sequenced. Inspection of the promoter region revealed the presence of two consecutive ISRE motifs within 85 bps from the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 2B). These elements were preceded by TATA element, and the binding motif for specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor. A putative and weak IFN-gamma-activated site (GAS) was identified at the distal end of the promoter and six consecutive GAAANN elements were predicted between GAS and Sp1 motifs (Fig. 3A). GAS is essential for IFN-gamma-mediated transcription of the genes whereas GAAANN elements have been demonstrated to regulate the virus-induced and type I IFN-regulated genes via the binding of interferon regulatory factors27,28.",

Additionally, five reporter constructs were generated each containing either all of the GAAANN elements, Sp1, TATA box, double or single ISRE promoter sequences (Fig. 3A,B). Luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess whether the upstream region of the chIFIT5 gene can mediate responses to stimuli from chIFN-\u03b2, dsRNA or virus infection. DF-1 cells were transiently transfected with these reporter plasmids and subsequent luciferase activity was monitored after stimulation with either chIFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 3C), dsRNA (Fig. 3D) or with NDV (Fig. 3E). Similar to IFN-induced promoter activation of chMx gene25, the chIFN-\u03b2 induced 13-fold higher luciferase activities in full-length promoter (Fig. 3C). However, further deletion of GAS, GAAANN, Sp1 and TATA box resulted in an approximately 4-fold reduction in basal transcription activity. Additional deletion of the distal ISRE reduced the IFN-responsiveness of the promoter. However, repetitive luciferase assays demonstrated that ISRE motif just proximal to the transcriptional start site was exceedingly responsive to the IFN-treatment with a highest of 19-fold induction in luciferase activity as compared to the control vector without a promoter sequence (Fig. 3C). In the dsRNA-dependent promoter induction (Fig. 3E), results demonstrated that the above elements and motifs (GAAANN, SpI and TATA box) are least important in controlling the transcriptional activation of luciferase gene and a non-significant difference was observed in the absence or presence of these motifs. However, promoter sequence containing dual ISRE motifs severely compromised the responsiveness of dsRNA on the IFIT5 promoter and the dsRNA-dependent promoter induction was restored when distal-ISRE was deleted, further suggesting the importance of this ISRE motif (Fig. 3E). Similar to dsRNA induction, the construct containing only one ISRE motif was highly inducible by NDV compared to the construct carrying both ISRE motifs (Fig. 3E). As was observed in the NDV-induced chMx promoter activation, all other constructs with variable lengths and motifs were also responsive to virus infections. Comparison of these three stimuli indicated lower luciferase activities in NDV and dsRNA-treated chicken cells compared to chIFN-\u03b2 induced promoter activation, presumably due to indirect activation of IFIT5 promoter by inducing endogenous IFNs.",

In silico analysis of highly responsive 122 bp sequence indicated that the ISRE motif (5\u2032-GCTTTCACTTTCT-3\u2032 at position \u221229 to \u221213 in pchIFIT5 \u2212101/+123 construct) was identical to the consensus ISRE (G/A/T)G/CTTTCN1-2TTTC(A/T/C) found in most of the IFN-inducible genes including chMx promoter sequence (Fig. 4A). For further absolute delineation of importance of this motif, we mutated both triplet thymidines (TTT), the core residues for the IFN-inducible activation of genes (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 2C). Responsiveness of the wild type (wt) and mutated ISRE motifs was assessed in chicken DF-1 cells with or without stimulation by chIFN-\u03b2, dsRNA or NDV using luciferase assays. While both pchIFIT5\u2013101/+123 and pchIFIT5\u2013101/+123-mut promoters were not auto-stimulatory, stimulation with either of the stimuli positively regulated the luciferase genes in pchIFIT5\u2013101/+123. Interestingly, stimulation of mutated promoter with chIFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 4C), dsRNA (Fig. 4D) or NDV (Fig. 4E) induced significantly lower promoter activation. These results revealed that the 16 nucleotide sequence containing single ISRE motif is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of the luciferase reporter gene. Taken together, structural and functional analysis of chIFIT5 promoter demonstrates that an ISRE motif approximately 16 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site is minimum essential cis-acting element required for the transcriptional activation of the IFIT5 gene in chickens.",

CEF cells were transduced with the appropriate VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral particles and infected with GFP expressing NDV. After 24 hours, the virus infectivity (GFP+) was quantified in lentivirus transduced (RFP+) cell population using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Fig. 5A). Lentivirus expressing firefly luciferase (ffluc), not expected to affect the virus replication, was used as a negative control. Human IRF1 (huIRF1), a potent virus restriction factor3, was used as a positive control (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. 3A). Compared to ffluc control, both huIRF1 and chIFIT5 significantly inhibited NDV replication (Fig. 5B,C), while the antiviral effect of chIFIT5 was greater than that of huIRF1 in CEFs. Since two populations of GFP+ cells were observed, further gating of low GFP+ and high GFP+ indicated a profound and cumulative antiviral effect compared to ffluc control (Supplementary Fig. 3B). These results showed that the chIFIT5-mediated antiviral effect is not profound at individual cell levels but it attenuates replication of the virus after initial infection.",

Similar to chIFIT5, both huIRF1 and huIFIT5 showed significant inhibition of NDV replication whereas no antiviral activities were observed by other huIFIT proteins in chickens (Fig. 5D). To further demonstrate the effect of IFIT5-induced inhibition of NDV replication, we observed an exclusive replication of either NDV (GFP+) or transduction of lentivirus expressing IFIT5 (RFP+) in 85% cells compared to ffluc expressing cells (n = 200) (Fig. 5E, upper panel). It is possible that transduction of lentivirus particles may interfere with the virus entry and/or NDV replication. To examine the lentivirus-mediated restriction of NDV replication, we used ffluc-transduced cells in the control group. The analysis of several microscopic fields showed simultaneous expression of lentiviruses-transduced ffluc protein and NDV infection (Fig. 5E, lower panel and Fig. 5B), demonstrating that the transduction of lentivirus particles doesn\u2019t interfere with the NDV replication.

DF-1 cells were co-transfected with hybridized crRNA and tracrRNA as well as a vector expressing hSpCas9 and puromycin resistance marker (PuroR) gene. For fast and efficient enrichment of genetic modification, a population of stably-integrated cells was selected with puromycin, and was further enriched using FACS (Fig. 6A). The relative frequency of gene editing in the puromycin-resistant and FACS-enriched cell was estimated from a DNA mismatch detection assay using T7 Endonuclease I (T7E1) (Fig. 6B). T7E1 assay showed a mutation frequency of 40% within the chIFIT5 gene, however, T7E1 assays are likely to underestimate the fold enrichment29. We subsequently sequenced the mutated sites and confirmed the in-frame or out-of-frame gene editing (Fig. 6C). Results of the T7E1 assay and sequencing showed that sgRNA2 sufficiently edited the gene and puromycin selection greatly improved the enrichment of the cells. Additionally, most of the mutations in the chIFIT5 gene appeared to be deletions, which introduce a pre-mature stop codon to the beginning of Exon 2 of the chIFIT5 gene.",

Both wt DF-1 and chIFIT5KO DF-1 were infected with NDV and VSV, and replication of viruses was monitored for 24 hours. Both NDV (Fig. 6D) and VSV (Fig. 6E) replicated efficiently in wt DF-1 cells over the time course of infection (2 to 24 hours). However, deletion of chIFIT5 by CRISPR/Cas9 further supported the replication of NDV (Fig. 6D) and VSV (Fig. 6E), confirming that chIFIT5 is a crucial antiviral effector and elimination of such factors weakens the hostile barriers of the host. These results also highlight the possible exploitation of innate immune genes in promoting virus replication for vaccine production. Additionally, we applied FACS to quantify the percentage infectivity of the wt DF-1 and chIFIT5KO DF-1 cells for GFP-expressing recombinant NDV. Data demonstrated that the wtDF-1 cells infectivity by NDV (45.6%) could further be enhanced (63.2%) in the absence of chIFIT5 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Cumulative quantitative measurement of NDV-infectivity was significantly enhanced in chIFIT5KO DF-1 cells compared to wt DF-1 cells (Fig. 6F). Next, in order to counter-confirm the antiviral potential of chIFIT5, the level of VSV replication was assessed in conventional plague assay in DF1 cells either overexpressing or knocked out with chIFIT5 (Fig. 6G). The VSV replicated effectively in wt DF-1 cells and overexpression of chIFIT5 suppressed the VSV whereas CRISPR/Cas9 knockout DF-1 cells substantially supported the virus replication (Fig. 6G). Together, these results confirm the potential of chIFIT5 as an important host restriction factor, at least against evaluated RNA viruses.",

In order to explore the molecular mechanisms of chIFIT5 recognition of RNA, we used 378 bp RNA without any known similarity to viral RNA sequences and structure, and generated (i) RNA bearing terminal 5\u2032 hydroxyl group (5\u2032OHRNA), and (ii) RNA bearing 5\u2032 triphosphate (5\u2032pppRNA) (Fig. 7A). These populations of RNA, mimicking viral RNA ends, were biotinylated and coupled with agarose beads. The beads were then incubated with chicken DF-1 cells expressing V5-tagged chIFIT5, the ribonucleoproteins were purified (Fig. 7B) and the interaction of chIFIT5 was determined by staining chIFIT5. While neither huIFIT5 nor chIFIT5 interacted with the 5\u2032OHRNA, both proteins recognized RNA carrying ppp at the 5\u2032 end (Fig. 7C).",

Transfection of chicken DF-1 cells with these vectors expressing shRNA under a chicken U6 promoter showed a reliable level of expression of the RFP marker gene indicating the functional integrity of the system (Fig. 9B). Although all shRNA were effective in silencing, quantitative analysis of NDV-induced chIFIT5 mRNA showed that shRNA#3 was the most effective (>50%) (Fig. 9D). Next, the validated shRNA cassette that included chicken U6 promoter, shRNA, leader and trailer sequences was transferred to the compatible RCASBP(A) vectors for silencing of chIFIT5 in ovo (Fig. 9C). Additionally, we used shRNA silencing-resistant RCASBP(A)-chIFIT5 retroviruses (Supplementary Fig. 5) to stably express the chIFIT5 in developing embryos in the presence of shRNA against endogenous chIFIT5 gene. The replication competency of shRNA expressing retroviruses was compared to the wt retroviruses (Fig. 9E) before using them to generate transgenic chicken embryos.",

The retroviral overexpression of chIFIT5 or silencing of chIFIT5 were normalized to non-infectious DF-1 cells or wt RCASPB(A) that did not express the transgene. Quantitative analysis of NDV showed an expected reduction in replication of the virus in IFIT5-overexpressing embryos, whereas silencing of endogenous chIFIT5 favoured the replication of NDV compared to the control DF-1 cells (Fig. 9G). A moderate reduction in the virus replication was observed in transgenic embryos that were simultaneously silenced for endogenous chIFIT5 and were stably expressing silence-resistant chIFIT5 (Fig. 9G). Taken together, these results not only confirm the antiviral activities of chIFIT5 in different experimental settings but also highlight the potential use of RCASPB(A) in enhancing the replication of avian viruses in embryonated eggs.",

Among the myriad of ISGs, members of the IFIT family have attracted recent attention for both immunological as well as virological reasons due to their abundant and profound transcription and translation responses to diverse stimuli such as IFNs and viruses9,19. Significant advances have been made during studies of the mechanisms of both human and mouse IFIT proteins19. However, the knowledge on the breadth and plasticity of the antiviral properties of IFIT proteins are currently inadequate for non-mammalian hosts. Characterizing the repertoire of IFIT proteins and investigating their functions in chicken are of special interest because of the unique features of the chicken immune system including the absence of essential components of innate immune induction and signalling such as RIG-I, IRF3, and IRF95 in chickens. Intriguingly, while chickens are lacking these components, they still mount profound innate responses against virus infections. Understanding the alternative means of innate immune regulation and antiviral defences in chicken could establish the foundation to control chicken-mediated emergence of zoonotic infections such as influenza viruses36.",

Based on its sequence and structure similarities, and phylogenetic associations, this single chicken IFIT gene is classified as IFIT5 (chIFIT5). Currently the chicken genome is about 90% annotated and all chromosomes are correctly characterized37, however, the possibility of orthlogous and pseudogenes in the non-annotated part (10%) of the chicken genome cannot be excluded at this stage. With regard to the complex IFN pathways and a number of major missing genes in chicken, the innate immune genes, as general sensors of self and non-self, are under continues evolutionary selection pressure compared to the pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. Therefore, it is plausible that IFIT proteins are generated by paralogue expansions and/or gene deletions in chicken6. IFIT5 is the only gene that is missing in the mice and rat genomes6 whereas it is the only gene identified in chicken, as this study shows. It remains to be determined in future if chIFIT5 also plays additional antiviral functions of the redundant IFIT1 and IFIT3.",

Interestingly, structural and functional characterization of the chIFIT5 promoter, required for effective transcriptional regulation of chIFIT5, was mapped within 100 bp of the transcriptional start site and carried a single ISRE motif. This minimum essential requirement of the promoter justifies several folds induction of chIFIT5 gene as early as 2 hours of post NDV-infection. Although transcription of IFIT5 was generally proportional to the virus replication and IFN induction, an IFN-independent regulation of chIFIT5 is also possible, especially when the chIFIT5 gene up-regulation was observed in earlier time points of virus-infection when the IFN gene was barely detectable. It is also plausible that transcriptional activation of chIFIT5 is directly regulated by IRF7 or related transcription factors and thus warrants future investigations. Nevertheless, these transcriptional patterns augment essential roles of the chIFIT5 protein during the early stages of virus replication such as interaction with viral genetic material (viral RNA/DNA) and viral protein translation.",

Probably due to these structural flexibilities, reports on IFIT5 functionalities are inconsistent7,30\u201332.

In order to understand the binding potential of chIFIT5 to modified RNA that either interacts specifically with human IFIT5 or with human IFIT1, we coupled modified RNA-coated beads with quantitative binding assays for chIFIT5. Our results indicated that chIFIT5 specifically interacted with RNA that carried 5\u2032-ppp modifications and failed to interact with RNA in which 5\u2032-ppp was replaced with OH.

The amplified PCR products were cloned between NheI and MluI into microRNA (miRNA) cloning sites of pRFPRNAiC (kind gift of Stuart Wilson, The University of Sheffield, UK). All shRNA coding plasmids were sequenced to confirm the inserts and orientations. To evaluate the silencing potential of individual shRNA, DF-1 cells were transfected with 500 ng plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and the knockdown effects on the chicken IFIT5 was monitored and compared with the scrambled RNA transfected control. Next, the validated shRNA cassette that included chicken U6 promoter, individual shRNA, leader and trailer sequences was transferred to the RCASBP(A) retrovirus vector between NotI and ClaI sites. Rescue of RCASBP(A)-sh3IFIT5 retroviruses and generation of mosaic transgenic chickens are detailed below.",
