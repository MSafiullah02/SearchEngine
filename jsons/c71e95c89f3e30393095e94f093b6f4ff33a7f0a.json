An immunochromatographic test to detect IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was used for the analysis (RC-NC002, KURABO Industries Ltd. https://www.kurabo.co.jp/bio/English/index.html). Ten microliter of serum was infused into the test kit, and the interpretation of the test results were made 15 minutes after the buffer was placed.

It was considered that identifying clusters occurring in Japan with monitoring and isolating close contacts with the identified patients were prudent strategy and it would be able to comprehend the trend of COVID-19 infections in Japan. 4 However, since difference between those who were identified and those who actually had infections was so huge according to our findings, Japan might not have comprehended the epidemic dynamics occurring in the nation.",

A similar study by Bendavid et al. identified that seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 at Santa Clara County, the United States, was 1.5%, and the estimated number of cases were 50-85 fold more than confirmed cases. 5 A previous study tried to estimate actual cases of COVID-19 and it concluded that close to half the cases are identified in Japan. 6 We consider this report underestimated the actual infection rate and excessively overestimated the ability of Japan's capability of diagnosing COVID-19. The study on the outbreak of COVID-19 in a cruise ship Diamond Princess suggested that there are about 20-40% asymptomatic cases among those infected with SARS-CoV-2, 7 and this could suggest finding of every case of COVID-19 rather unrealistic. However, even with this assumption, missing cases by several hundred fold is not acceptable, and better strategy should have been implemented to better fight against this infection.",

Rather, Japan probably had significant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 like other countries. On the other hand, is the data on mortality due to COVID-19 reliable in Japan? There is no thorough investigation on the accuracy of mortality data regarding COVID-19 in Japan, but concordance of death certificates and autopsy diagnoses for pneumonia in Japan was only 9%, and the possibility of underestimates of mortality also needs to be considered. 8 If we consider the mortality data in Japan accurate, it raises another question why there is fewer deaths due to COVID-19 in Japan. Vaccination of BCG (Bacille de Calmette et Guerin) are hypothesized to affect the clinical impact of COVID-19, 9 but further studies will be needed to confirm its effects.",

There might be underdiagnosis of the viral infection, particularly at the early stage of infection, or those with immunosuppressed. The possibility of overdiagnosis by cross-reaction with other viruses, such as conventional coronavirus as a cause of common cold, although it had never been documented as of this writing, should be considered. Second, the population of our cohort might not be the same as one in Kobe City. The samples were obtained from the patients from the clinic. Although we adjusted the age and sex distribution to fit the general population, the selection bias should be unavoidable. Further serological studies targeting randomly selected people in Kobe City could clarify this potential limitation. However, even we put these potential limitations into consideration, the difference between what had been reported as the confirmed cases and estimated cases in our study is so huge, and our interpretation of the findings sounds rather robust and valid.",
