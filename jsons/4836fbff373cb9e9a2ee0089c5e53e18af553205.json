TGEV appearance in 1946 preceded identification of PEDV (1971) and PDCoV (2009) that are considered as emerging CoVs. A spike deletion mutant of TGEV associated with respiratory tract infection in piglets appeared in 1984 in pigs in Belgium and was designated porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is considered non-pathogenic because the infection is very mild or subclinical. Since PRCV emergence and rapid spread, most pigs have become immune to both PRCV and TGEV, which has significantly reduced the clinical and economic importance of TGEV. In contrast, PDCoV and PEDV are currently expanding their geographic distribution, and there are reports on the circulation of TGEV-PEDV recombinants that cause a disease clinically indistinguishable from that associated with the parent viruses. TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV cause acute gastroenteritis in pigs (most severe in neonatal piglets) and matches in their clinical signs and pathogenesis. Necrosis of the infected intestinal epithelial cells causes villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhoea. Profuse diarrhoea frequently combined with vomiting results in dehydration, which can lead to the death of piglets. Strong immune responses following natural infection protect against subsequent homologous challenge; however, these viruses display no cross-protection. Adoption of advance biosecurity measures and effective vaccines control and prevent the occurrence of diseases due to these porcine-associated CoVs. Recombination and reversion to virulence are the risks associated with generally highly effective attenuated vaccines necessitating further research on alternative vaccines to ensure their safe application in the field.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Keywords Porcine coronaviruses \u00b7 Transmissible gastroenteritis virus \u00b7 Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus \u00b7 Porcine deltacoronavirus \u00b7 Enteropathogens \u00b7 Porcine respiratory coronavirus \u00b7 Pathology \u00b7 Detection \u00b7 Vaccine", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "All known porcine coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus of the subfamily Coronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, of the order Nidovirales (de Groot et al. 2008) [https://data. ictvonline.org/taxonomy-search.asp?msl_id=30 ( (5) the PDCoV (porcine deltacoronavirus) described in 2012.

While there is no evidence of the existence of different PEDV serotypes (Lin et al. 2015a) , genetically, PEDV strains are classified into two groups: (1) classical (isolates from Eurasia that are genetically similar to the prototype CV777 strain) and (2) emerging PEDV strains Vlasova et al. 2014 ).
