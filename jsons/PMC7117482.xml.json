Climate change and climate variability, in part the consequence of atmospheric pollution, add new layers to this conglomerate of basic driving forces, as do the numerous factors which underlie human over- and under-nutrition (Gage et al., 2008, Patz et al., 2008). Infectious diseases are nonlinearly correlated with poverty as the burden falls most heavily on poor people in developing countries (Guerrant and Blackwood, 1999), particularly on infants and children, e.g. about three million children die each year from malaria and diarrhoeal diseases alone. The disability-adjusted life year (DALY), a measure of overall disease burden (WHO, 2008), of diarrhoea and malaria of all age groups in 2004 accounted for 4.8% (72.8 million) and 2.2% (34 million) of total DALYs, respectively (WHO, 2004)",

            "text": "All infections involving an agent (or pathogen) and/or host(s) are already present in the environment. Some agents (or pathogens) require vectors or intermediate hosts to complete their life cycles, a situation which can amplify impact (Butler, 2012, McMichael, 2004). Environmental conditions have a broad-based influence by either favouring or hindering pathogens, vectors, host defences directly or by changing the habitats exploited by the participating species (host or infectious agent). On rare occasions, changing environmental conditions can provide the opportunity for new pathogen variants to emerge, for instance, new influenza viruses (Aguirre and Tabor, 2008, Epstein, 2001, Zell, 2004). Landscapes altered by agricultural development can also become more sensitive to changes in other environmental variables, setting up a feedback loop that further degrades the ecosystem affecting human society adversely. Poor agricultural practises, for example, have the power to directly degrade living conditions via malnutrition due to food shortage (Sheeran, 2008), while water-borne diseases emerge following water resource development (Hunter et al., 1993, Keiser et al., 2005, Steinmann et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2005). Indeed, most influenza pandemics appear to have an agricultural origin (Ho and Su, 2004, Zhong, 2008). There are many examples of interaction between environmental or agricultural changes and infectious diseases, e.g. the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the People's Republic of China (P.R. China) in 2003 (Zhong, 2008) and Lyme disease in Europe in 2000 (Aguirre and Tabor, 2008, Ogden et al., 2008, Randolph, 2008). Changed interaction between humans and wild or domestic animal populations comes to mind as the most probable facilitator of the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), avian influenza, Nipah virus and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Chastel, 2004, Genne, 2007, Kong et al., 2008, Snowden, 2008).",

First, environmental changes cause significant hazards to human health, which might exacerbate due to increased air pollution, declining water quality, inadequate sanitation, and toxic industrial discharges (Harpham and Tanner, 1995). Second, agricultural practices, including intensive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other industrial input, degrade natural resources and the environment leading to a slowdown or even decline in agricultural growth in addition to negative impact on human health, biodiversity and ecosystems (Trias, 1987). Third, a specific disease can have either positive or negative effects on an individual or entire communities (McMichael, 2004, WHO, 2003). For example, an infectious disease outbreak can alert more people to take attention to the health development of a community, while poverty cannot be eliminated. Environmental degradation exacerbates malnutrition, disease, and injury, whereas infectious diseases of poverty cannot be alleviated in circumstances of hazardous lifestyle, and poverty (Zhou, 2012). Hence, all components of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG) are closely interlinked (Wagstaff et al., 2006) and concerted efforts are reputed to break the poverty cycle related to human health (Tyer-Viola and Cesario, 2010).",

Consequences of this change are manifested in environmentally induced challenges such as reduced water run-off in some rivers and flooding in others, extreme weather events (floods, blizzards and dust storms) (Yang et al., 2005). Most recently, the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province took the life of 70,000 people, about 1300 schools had to be reconstructed and 25 townships relocated (Hu et al., 2012). There is also growing concern about the potential future effects of climate change on agricultural productivity. While P.R. China has made progress in controlling and eliminating infectious diseases, important public health challenges such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis and hepatitis B persist (Yang et al., 2008). In recent years, the country has witnessed outbreaks of newly emerging infectious diseases (Aguirre and Tabor, 2008, Yan et al., 2012), including the occurrence of SARS in 2003, avian influenza in 2004, Streptococcus suis infection in 2005, angiostrongyliasis in 2006, enterovirus 71 (EV71) in 2008, and chikungunya fever in 2010.",

            "text": "Schistosomiasis is caused by infection by with the blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum through water contact, as the intermediate host is a snail. Historical records show a high correlation between schistosomiasis transmission intensity and environmental or ecological factors, such as temperature, vegetation and rainfall (Yang et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2008). More recently, research focused on the impact of climate change on schistosomiasis transmission based on the fact that January mean temperature of \u22640 \u00b0C restricts the distribution of Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host of S. japonicum (Mao, 1990). The impact of global warming on the transmission of schistosoma japonica can be grouped into (i) direct and (ii) indirect effects (Fig. 1\n). It has been reported that the 0\u20131 \u00b0C isotherm in January, a crucial feature determining O. hupensis survival, has shifted latitude from 33\u00b015\u2032N to 33\u00b041\u2032N between the 1960s and the 1990s (Yang et al., 2005). This shift translates to a potential surface area expansion of 41,335 km2 (Yang et al., 2005). An estimated additional 20.7 million people are thus potentially at risk of S. japonicum infection in central P.R. China (Yang et al., 2005). In view of the current estimate that 779 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis worldwide (Steinmann et al., 2006), the 20.7 million additional at-risk Chinese translates to 2.7% on the global scale. Although moderate, this increase will have profound public health and economic implications. However, these figures are dwarfed by might be in store in the longer perspective. Using combined indexes, namely temperature thresholds of both the parasite and the intermediate host snail, together with predicted temperature increases in P.R. China of 0.9 \u00b0C by 2030 and 1.6 \u00b0C by 2050, indicates that the areas at risk of schistosomiasis may grow to as much as of 662,373 km2 and 783,883 km2 by 2030 and 2050, respectively. By 2050, this translates to 8.1% of the surface area of P.R. China. The same study also suggests that the transmission intensity would increase in the areas endemic for schistosomiasis today due to higher temperature (Zhou et al., 2008).",

It comes in four slightly different serotypes and has been an emerging public-health problem in P.R. China, as well as in other parts of Southeast Asia for some time (Chastel, 2004). Early documented Chinese epidemics of dengue in 1902, 1915 and 1922 in Penghu Islet, Taiwan (King et al., 2000) estimated infection rates as high as 80%. Two subsequent outbreaks occurred in 1931 and 1942\u20131943 (Wu et al., 2003). In mainland P.R. China, dengue fever was probably imported at the beginning of the 20th century, and epidemics occurred in the cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Haikou in the 1920s and the 1940s. A severe outbreak occurred in 1978 in Fushan, Guangdong province, with a total of 22,122 cases infected with the DEN-4 dengue virus variant (Fan et al., 2004, Qiu et al., 1993, Zhao, 1981). Since then, epidemics with high incidence rates were mainly reported from the south-eastern part of P.R. China with hotspots in Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces (Fan et al., 2004, Huang, 1982, Li et al., 1986, Qiu et al., 1991, Yang et al., 1989). Due to globalization and rapid urban development, a shift of occurrence of dengue cases from rural to urban and peri-urban areas has been observed in recent years (Wenming et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2005).",

Avian influenza also affects humans by increasing the opportunity of generating new influenza viruses by gene rearrangement involving the human influenza virus. The outbreak of avian flu in Hong Kong in 1997 showed, for the first time, that avian influenza can directly infect people and cause death (Kim et al., 2011). Therefore, the public health significance of avian flu, especially the HPAI type, needs to be re-evaluated. On 8 August 2006, the Chinese Ministry of Health announced the first laboratory-confirmed human pulmonary infection with HPAI in P.R. China. Seven, 12 and five human infections with HPAI resulting in five, eight and three deaths were reported in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. In December 2008, eight cases of human infection of HPAI (H5N1) were reported, five of which was fatal (Chen, 2009, Wu, 2009).",

Although the disease is not yet transmitted efficiently from person to person, transmission of influenza A/H5N1 virus through air has been proved ferrets (Herfst et al., 2012).

Outbreak investigations found that 75.1% of the patients had eaten raw apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata) or raw giant African land snails (Achatina fulica) (Lv et al., 2008, Lv et al., 2009b). The import and sale of infected P. canaliculata was the likely trigger for this angiostrongyliasis outbreak. Among the different factors facilitating the spread and transmission of A. cantonensis in P.R. China, the two invasive mollusk species P. canaliculata and A. fulica, play a central role (Lv et al., 2009b, Lv et al., 2010). Indeed, P. canaliculata and A. fulica have invaded the southern part of P.R. China after being imported from South America (through Taiwan) in the 1980s and East Africa in the 1930s. While both snail species were imported as food, they also became established in the wild fauna and are now common in the southern part of P.R. China (Deng et al., 2011, Lv et al., 2006). Vast habitats with suitable environmental conditions are found in many parts of the country. As a result, there is a need for strengthening food safety inspections and food-borne disease surveillance (Lv et al., 2009a).",

The first survey revealed an overall infection rate of intestinal parasites of 62.6%, with an average infection rate of hookworm at 17.2%, Ascaris lumbricoides at 47% and Trichuris trichiura at 18.8%. The second national survey revealed that soil-transmitted helminth infections decline substantially by 407 million infections compared with that in the first national survey (CONSIHPD, 2005). The standardized rate of hookworm, A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections had decreased by 61%, 71%, and 74%, respectively (CONSIHPD, 2005, Xu et al., 1995, Yu et al., 1994). Although the infection rate tended to increase gradually from the north to the south of the country (CONSIHPD, 2005), the infection rates in some southern areas, i.e. Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces/municipalities were lower than those of many other central and southern provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities due to large-scale control activities, rapid local economical development, and improved living standards of the farmers (CONSIHPD, 2005, Yu et al., 1994). In some less-developed counties and townships in central and western P.R. China, the number of soil-transmitted helminth infections remained high and difficult to control due to complicated natural, social, and behavioural factors. The inaccessibility of transportation as well as budgetary constraints were key impediments for parasitic disease control (CONSIHPD, 2005, Yu et al., 1994).",

This cycle cannot be interrupted without a clear understanding of the interplay between environment, agriculture, and infectious diseases of poverty (Butler, 2012, Zhou, 2012).

            "text": "To begin to understand the correlations between environment, agriculture and infectious diseases, the following four research priorities are proposed:1.Identification of an appropriate set of metrics of infectious diseases and environmental/agricultural factors (Hunter, 2003, WHO, 2012, Yang et al., 2010). Previous estimates were either too broad to be useful or too narrow to cover the full spectrum of environmental challenges. In addition, metrics applied in different regions were not commensurable. A standardized set of metrics would help by spotting current problems and identifying priority environmental issues.2.Definition of risk factors, quantitatively and qualitatively, due to infectious diseases and the environment (Chen et al., 2002, Yu et al., 2005). Environmental and health challenges come in several forms which vary with the level of wealth and development. Without a standardized index, comparisons between various diseases are hazardous. The use of the DALY metric is a step in the right direction but it needs further development, e.g. by inclusion also of subtle pathology. For example, some of the neglected tropic diseases have considerable subtle morbidity which is inefficiently taken into consideration in the current version of DALY estimation (Jia et al., 2007, Jia et al., 2011, King et al., 2005).3.Establishment of models to evaluate the proportion of a particular disease that is influenced by a single or interacting risk factors (Yang et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2008). To evaluate the relationships between these factors, robust and accurate statistics and mathematical models are required, which allow prompt regional and global responses to changes in the transmission intensity of the infectious disease in question.4.The design of disease-related policies and programmes for decision-makers (Lv et al., 2009a, Odermatt et al., 2010). Fuelled by advances in information technology, data-driven decision-making has and become a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for surveillance and response activities (Yang et al., 2012). In the policy domain, quantitative and qualitative performance metrics should reshape activities as it is necessary to apply a similar, data-driven, fact-based empirical approach to provide concrete evidence for health policy makers (Malone et al., 2010).\n",

One is mitigation, i.e. to limit the risk factors, and the other is adaptation, which means that although all efforts must be made in seeking to limit the negative impacts of industrial development, some degree of inevitable environmental or agriculture changes should be accepted. Mitigation and adaptation share the same ultimate purpose, which is to reduce undesirable impacts (Swart and Raes, 2007). The bottom line is that the more effective mitigations undertaken now, the less need will there be for adaptation in the future. The most successful example is the current responses to climate change, which is undertaken by a majority of all countries (Dowlatabadi, 2007, Willbanks and Sathaye, 2007). However, even the most rigorous mitigation efforts cannot avoid further impacts of climate change because of historically committed emissions, making action on adaptation essential. At the same time, adaptation cannot be allowed to rule indefinitely, so urgent mitigation is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Investigations needed to answer how to best balance these demands are proposed to be implemented in community-based studies involved by local stakeholders to get more evidence-based results (Willbanks and Sathaye, 2007).",

The specific four-pronged approach (Yang et al., 2010), including identifying metrics (Lv et al., 2009b, Steinmann et al., 2006), defining risk factors quantitatively and qualitatively (Lv et al., 2006, Matola et al., 1987, McMichael et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2000), establishment of models to explore the interactions among risk factors (Keiser et al., 2005, Li et al., 1986, Lv et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2008), and designing policies and programmes for specific disease for decision makers (Collins et al., 2012, Lv et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2005), are proposed to identify the multi-risk factors related to the global changes in environment, agriculture, and health. A response strategy based on mitigation and adaptation is important to interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases (McMichael, 2004). Finally, the assessment plays the key role in providing information to adaptation of intervention strategies that tailored to local settings in order to reduce the impact of global changes (Kong et al., 2008). Such an integrated and trans-disciplinary approach should provide tangible evidence for policy-makers regarding the best possible and the most cost-effective interventions (Huang et al., 2002, Hunter, 2003, Zhou, 2012) (see Box 1, Box 2\n).Box 1Key points of the review\n\u2022There is a vicious cycle between poverty and infectious diseases affected by factors of environmental changes, agricultural practices and social status.\u2022Emerging and re-emerging diseases, e.g. schistosomiasis, dengue, avian influenza, and angiostrongyliasis, can be limited to environmental and agricultural change in P.R.
