In African rangelands, species such as African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) may kill livestock and are therefore themselves killed by local pastoralists. Such conflict has led to the extirpation of these species from many areas, and also impacts the livelihoods of local livestock farmers. To investigate the possibilities for coexistence of people, livestock, and large predators in community rangelands, we measured the effectiveness of traditional livestock husbandry in reducing depredation by wild carnivores, using a case-control approach. Different measures were effective against different predator species but, overall, the risk of predator attack by day was lowest for small herds, accompanied by herd dogs as well as human herders, grazing in open habitat. By night, the risk of attack was lowest for herds held in enclosures ('bomas') with dense walls, pierced by few gates, where both men and domestic dogs were present. Unexpectedly, the presence of scarecrows increased the risks of attack on bomas. Our findings suggest that improvements to livestock husbandry can contribute to the conservation and recovery of large carnivores in community rangelands, although other measures such as prey conservation and control of domestic dog diseases are also likely to be necessary for some species.",

Human-wildlife conflict is a particularly serious issue in the conservation of large mammalian carnivores, which can prey on livestock (and occasionally people), and are therefore frequently killed by farmers or wildlife managers.",

There is a clear need, therefore, to identify measures which demonstrably reduce livestock depredation by wild carnivores. Such measures may be particularly valuable where populations of highly threatened carnivores live alongside people and livestock, and where local people may benefit from carnivores' presence through tourism or hunting.",

The staff did not collect data over the whole area, and their home locations (shown in Fig. 1 ) and work schedules were dictated by their other duties: hence the number and distribution of predator attacks that they investigated may not give an accurate picture of the relative depredation rate in different areas or by different predators. Fig. 1 The distribution within the study area of reported predator attacks on herds grazing by day, along with the approximate home locations of field staff investigating attacks. The number of field staff locations is smaller than the number of field staff because some staff worked in pairs. Commercial ranches are shaded in grey; communities inhabit remaining areas In particular two staff were employed in the north-west of the study areas specifically to monitor a pack of wild dogs that were chronic predators of livestock; attacks by this pack were highly localised (Woodroffe et al. 2005a ) and the proportion of the investigated livestock attacks that were made by wild dogs is therefore very unlikely to be representative of true proportion across the entire study area.",

Staff recorded the location and timing of each attack, whether livestock were killed while out grazing or when enclosed in a boma, and the number and age of livestock killed or injured. For attacks on grazing herds, they also recorded the herder's perception of whether the predator(s) initiated the attack by approaching the herd, or whether the herd stumbled upon a resting predator. Detailed data on livestock husbandry on the day of the attack were then collected for the herd or boma which had been attacked (the case herd) and between one and three nearby control herds or bomas that had not been attacked. Controls were selected on the basis of proximity alone and were not matched to cases in any other way. The median distance between case grazing herds and their controls was 656 m, and the median distance between case and control bomas was 323 m; hence a high proportion of control herds and bomas are likely to have been detectable to the predators that attacked the case herds. Fig. 2 The distribution within the study area of predator attacks on herds enclosed in bomas at night. Commercial ranches are shaded in grey; communities inhabit remaining areas For each grazing herd, observers recorded the number of livestock of different species present, and the number of herders (men, women and children), and domestic dogs, accompanying the herd. The type of terrain grazed was recorded in five categories (flat, rolling hills, single escarpment, hilly, mountainous), and the density of the vegetation in the grazing area was recorded in four categories (open grassland, light bush, dense bush, very dense bush), using reference photographs provided to all observers. For case herds, details of terrain and habitat density were recorded for the site of the attack, as well as for the grazing area in general.",

A small number of bomas were constructed from a combination of solid posts and wire; classifying these as either ''solid'' or ''wire'' did not influence overall conclusions. For thornbrush, solid and wire bomas, the number of gates into the boma was also recorded. The height (in cm) of the boma walls was recorded at 10 m intervals around the perimeter of the boma. Likewise, for thornbrush bomas, the thickness of the boma walls was measured at 10 m intervals using a thin pole and a tape-measure. In addition, the density of thornbrush boma walls was estimated every 10 m by measuring the transparency of the wall; transparency was scored by having an assistant hold a 'chequerboard' marked with 100 2 cm \u00b7 2 cm squares, shaded alternately black and white, against the inside boma wall at a height of 1 m from the ground, and recording the number of white squares which were more than 50% visible to an observer outside the boma with their eye also 1 m from the ground (hence maximum transparency received a score of 50). Analyses used the minimum height and width, and the maximum transparency, excluding (where appropriate) any site where the predator or livestock had broken through the boma wall. For thornbrush bomas, observers also recorded whether the majority of tree branches were facing the inside or the outside of the boma, and also the time since the boma walls were last repaired.",

The two primary analyses considered all data on all attacks on either (i) grazing herds, or (ii) bomas, pooling data for all predators and all livestock prey species. Data were pooled in this way because farmers experience the same loss whether a calf is, for example, killed by a lion or a hyaena. Subsequent analyses were restricted to attacks by single species of predator, to investigate the husbandry measures most effective against each. Some predator species apparently specialised on particular livestock prey (e.g. cheetahs killed sheep and goats, but never cattle); hence a nearby control herd might have been ignored by the predator not because of differences in husbandry, but because it did not contain the preferred prey species. Analyses of attacks by specific predator species were therefore restricted to the cases involving only the most common prey species, omitting also any control herds or bomas not including the favoured prey. Hence, for example, analyses for leopards involved 39 attacks on grazing sheep and goat herds (excluding nine attacks on grazing cattle) and 35 attacks on sheep and goats in bomas (excluding one attack on cattle).",

Analysis of attacks by different predator species on their most common domestic prey revealed marked variation in which husbandry features were most effective. Results for leopards were similar to those for all predators (perhaps because leopard attacks were most common, Table 2 ); multivariate analysis (n = 39 matched sets) revealed that leopard attacks were more likely for sheep and goat herds that were unaccompanied by herd dogs (odds ratio 0.091, 95% CI 0.02-0.45, v 2 = 8.63, df = 1, P = 0.003), and those that grazed in more dense habitat (open & light bush vs. dense & very dense bush; odds ratio 7.33, 95% CI 1.22-43.94, v 2 = 4.76, df = 1, P = 0.029).

Nevertheless, Figs. 1 and 2 suggest a non-random distribution of attacks by different predators. Wild dog attacks appear concentrated in the north-western part of the study area; reasons for this are discussed in detail elsewhere (Woodroffe et al. 2005a ) but probably reflect severe depletion of wild prey in this area. Figures 1 and 2 also indicate that most of the investigated lion attacks occurred on or near commercial ranches, even though observers were working primarily on community land. This probably reflects lions' marked preference for commercial ranches , perhaps because wild prey are more abundant there (Khaemba et al. 2001) .",

However, our case-control approach allowed us to more precisely quantify the relative impacts of different husbandry factors and should be helpful in indicating improvements that could reduce livestock losses to predators. For example, analyses indicate that having a domestic dog accompanying a herd reduces the risk of attack by 63% (Table 1 ), yet only 24% of herds were so accompanied even though dogs were present at 71% of bomas. Likewise, we found that each gate in a boma wall increases the likelihood of attack by 40% (Table 3 ), yet the average boma had 2.4 gates. These sorts of findings are helpful because they allows farmers (and conservation managers) to make informed decisions about optimal livestock husbandry, taking into account, for example, that a more densely constructed boma wall will provide more effective protection for livestock (and hence lead to fewer predators being killed), but will also be more labour-intensive to construct (and involve greater offtake from slowlygrowing native trees, Okello et al. 2001) .",

Concurrent findings in line with expectations-for example that predation events were more likely to occur in dense bush, or that domestic dogs help to deter attacks-suggest that these counter-intuitive findings should not be dismissed as anomalous. The detrimental effect of scarecrows was particularly marked for leopards although, after adjusting for the significant effects reported above, non-significant trends for lions (P = 0.137) and hyaenas (P = 0.127) were in the same direction. This unintended effect of scarecrows might perhaps reflect attraction to a visual cue (cloth moving in the wind)-although similar moving flags have been shown to deter wolves from attacking livestock (Musiani et al. 2003) . While the detrimental effect of multiple child herders was unforeseen, community members had an immediate explanation for this findings: lone herd boys are likely to be more attentive to their flocks than those with companions to talk or play with.",

It should be noted that the dogs involved are not selectively bred for guarding livestock, nor do they actively chase predators away; their main role is to alert people to predators' presence. It is perhaps not surprising that domestic dogs reduce livestock depredation, and, by extension, reduce the numbers of predators killed by livestock farmers. This finding is important, however, because domestic dogs also have negative consequences for predator conservation: they carry infectious diseases that have the potential to substantially reduce the viability of wild carnivore populations (Cleaveland and Dye 1995; Laurenson et al. 1998; Roelke-Parker et al. 1996) , and are also widely used for hunting wild prey. While, from a disease perspective, control of domestic dog populations might be desirable (Laurenson et al. 2004 ), our findings suggest that benefits to carnivore conservation achieved by reduced disease risks might be countered by increased retaliatory killing associated with livestock depredation. This reinforces the idea that-outside protected areas at least-vaccination (rather than control) of domestic dog populations is a more sustainable solution to disease threats for wild carnivores (Laurenson et al. 2004 ). These benefits of domestic dogs are widely recognised by local people: interviews conducted at 562 bomas revealed that 49% of interviewees wanted more dogs at their boma, compared with 42% wanting to keep the same number and just 9% wanting fewer (R. Woodroffe unpubl. data). The possibly (though not statistically significantly) detrimental effects of domestic dogs on livestock predation by wild dogs are perhaps unsurprising; there are several anecdotal reports of wild dogs being attracted to domestic dogs (R. Woodroffe unpubl. data; Butynski 1974) .",

Since attacks by leopards and hyaenas dominated our dataset, effects on these species will have strong effects on the overall results presented in Tables 1 and 3; hence findings for the particular species may be more appropriate for applying to other areas with different predator problems. For example, in the majority of community areas studied, the principal predators of livestock were leopards and hyaenas (Figs. 1, 2) , suggesting that the most effective husbandry approaches would involve ensuring that domestic dogs accompany grazing herds as well as staying at bomas at night, building bomas with thick walls and the minimum number of gates (ideally reinforced to further reduce losses), and removing scarecrows from bomas. In the north-west of our study area, however, wild dogs were the principal predator of livestock. Here, therefore, the most important improvements to livestock husbandry would be to avoid assigning herding duties to groups of children, and perhaps also to discourage domestic dogs from accompanying herds. These differences illustrate how local conditions need to be taken into account in extrapolating our findings to other areas where predator communities may differ.",

Similar approaches would presumably also be effective in other parts of Africa, or for similar species elsewhere. However, whether such approaches would be adopted in other areas depends on multiple factors including local herding traditions, access to materials to construct bomas, the availability of education and alternative employment for potential herders, and opportunities for generating income from predator conservation (through tourism or trophy hunting) as well as from livestock farming. Moreover, preventing wild carnivores from killing livestock will only contribute to their conservation if alternative, wild, prey are available to them. For species such as wild dogs and cheetahs, which can survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Durant 1998; Mills and Gorman 1997) , the maintenance of traditional livestock husbandry (perhaps combined with control of domestic dog diseases) may be sufficient to allow populations to persist in pastoralist community lands (Woodroffe et al. 2005a ). In contrast, evidence suggests that lions may require higher densities of wild prey , indicating that improvements to livestock husbandry will not allow lion populations to recover in community lands in the absence of measures to promote conservation of their prey.",
