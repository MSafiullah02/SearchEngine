On the other hand, women-focused OSH research has concentrated on the relatively small number of professions that master the majority of the female work-force. This fact probably explains the relatively large volume of studies on health-care professions (which are easily accessible to research), while women workers remain heavily underrepresented in OSH studies in other sectors (Messing & Stellman Mager 2006 ) c.
