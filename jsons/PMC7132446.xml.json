Lower respiratory tract infections have been estimated to cause over 4 million deaths a year (range 3.6\u20134.4 million), of which approximately 40% are caused by respiratory viruses (Global Burden of Disease Collaborators, 2018). The emergence of high morbidity viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2004, influenza A(H5N1) in 2005, Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and influenza A(H7N9) in 2013, as well as discovery of novel viral pathogens such as human metapneumovirus in 2001 and human bocavirus in 2005 have highlighted the importance of international collaboration on respiratory virus research for their prevention and control. The International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses Diseases (isirv) is an independent international scientific professional society promoting the prevention, detection, treatment, and control of influenza and other respiratory virus diseases. The Antiviral Group is a special interest group of isirv (isirv-AVG) with specific objectives to promote the understanding and development of antivirals against respiratory viruses, and to collate and provide up to date information on the emergence of antiviral resistance to the established therapeutics. It also aims to provide information on the evaluation of resistance to new therapies under development. To communicate advances in preclinical and clinical development of potent novel antivirals five previous conferences have been organized by the isirv-AVG.",

The high mortality associated with human infections with novel coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and avian influenza strains (influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)) have raised questions about the possible role of a dysregulated immune response, a so called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory disease. As some patients may not respond to typical anti-pathogen therapeutics (e.g. antivirals), BARDA is pursuing therapeutics which target the host in order to modify the immune/host response. More work needs to be done to identify these host targets and develop therapeutics towards the dysregulated immune response. The field also needs better diagnostics to guide treatment as over-suppression of the immune response can be just as dangerous as over-stimulation.",

This is not because of lack interest by the pharmaceutical industry. Yet despite the cost, there is no guarantee of success in commercial markets. With this perspective, BARDA views the development landscape as having 2 valleys of death \u2013 advanced development valley (where candidates that look promising in early studies fail in pivotal studies) and the sustainability valley (where candidates have success in pivotal studies, but fail to find commercial success). BARDA has historically seen a role in mitigating the risk of advanced development; however, all vested parties need to come together to find ways to mitigate the risk of sustainability.",

            "text": "Induction of acute lung injury caused by infection can occur due to the cytokine storm resulting from the activation of the inflammatory response. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition receptor and its prototype \u201cpathogen-associated molecular pattern\u201d (PAMP) is gram-negative bacteria endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR4 has been implicated in the pathology associated with other infections as well as tissue damage caused by non-infectious insults. The TLR4 signaling pathway is activated by LPS binding initially to CD14, which transfers the LPS to a non-covalently associated TLR4 co-receptor, MD2. LPS binding to MD2 leads to TLR4 dimerization and activation. The Vogel laboratory previously showed that TLR4-null mice were highly resistant to infection by the mouse-adapted influenza A/PR/8/34(H1N1) [PR8] strain (Shirey et al., 2013), providing the rationale that blocking TLR4 signaling might be protective against influenza infection. Eritoran, a structural analog of LPS, functions as a TLR4 antagonist by binding to MD2, thereby preventing the interaction of LPS with MD2. Eritoran was demonstrated to have therapeutic benefit in the context of protection against acute lung injury in experimental murine and cotton rat models of influenza infection. Administration of eritoran once daily for 5 consecutive days to wild-type mice starting 2 days after PR8 infection resulted in highly significant protection against lethality and improved lung pathology. Moreover, a significant degree of survival was observed even when eritoran was administered to PR8-infected mice starting as late as day 6 post-infection. Protection against influenza infection was confirmed using other TLR4 antagonists including an anti-TLR4-specific antibody, TLR4 cell-permeable decoy peptides, a structural analog antagonist (FP7), and the small molecule TLR4 antagonist, TAK242 (Perrin-Cocon et al., 2017; Piao et al., 2015). Eritoran was also protective in cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) infected with non-adapted human influenza A and B strains.",

Infection of mice or cotton rats with influenza causes the release of HMGB1, a host-derived protein that has been shown to be a TLR4 agonist and is released from dying cells. The administration of eritoran blocks release of HMGB1 and blunts influenza-induced cytokine induction which, in turn, results in improved lung function, reversal of edema, and reduced viral titer. Moreover, administration of an HMGB1 small molecule antagonist provides the same degree of protection to PR8-infected mice as eritoran.",

The rationale for targeting the host rather than virus is that the host is less likely to develop resistance to the therapeutic. Furthermore, as viruses can utilize common host molecular pathways, a number of different viruses could be potentially targeted by a single therapeutic. By utilizing therapeutics that have already been approved, or have completed phase 2 or 3 clinical trials for their initial indication, it would reduce the regulatory burden and lower development costs. Clinical gene expression signature data obtained from hospitalized influenza-positive patients was used to screen for potential drug candidates. During an infection the virus will modify cellular expression to create an environment that will facilitate translation and replication of the virus. The goal was to find a drug that can reverse this process and create an environment within the host that is unfavorable for the virus.",

Lung injury and inflammation are the primary drivers of severe disease during influenza infection and also set up conditions for secondary infection, they are a new focus for treatment options. The acute lung injury that occurs as a result of pneumonia is driven by a number of mediators, including innate immune cells such as macrophages and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMP-9 is associated both with lung development and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) where it has a role in remodeling. Digestion of collagen by MMP's generate short tripeptides (PGP acetylated) that serve as matrikines (extracellular matrix-derived peptides which regulate cell activity) and these bind to the IL-8 receptor causing neutrophils to enter the lung (Gaggar et al., 2008). Digestion of the extracellular matrix and remodeling that occurs in the lung and transmigration of immune cells into the interstitial spaces and air spaces are both important in driving the biology of a number of infections. Preliminary work using samples taken from a cohort study at Brigham and Women's hospital showed that patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and enrolled with pneumonia with a pO2 less than 80 mmHg and required supplemental O2 had elevated levels of MMP-9, even more pronounced in those patients with seasonal and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. This was also shown to occur in mice as well. A related serendipitous observation demonstrated inhibiting MMP-9 was protective in a mouse model for influenza exacerbation in COPD. These observations provided the impetus to identify candidate therapeutics that target MMP-9 for use as potential treatment options.",

The physiochemical properties of the minibinders (Fleishman et al., 2011) and manufacturability (Chevalier et al., 2017) have significantly improved in recent years. Minibinder (A13) is a small protein (40 amino acid) that binds with high affinity and has improved physiochemical properties where it is stable at temperatures up to 80 \u00b0C. In vivo studies have shown that protection conferred by the minibinder A13 is independent of the presence of an Fc.

Neutrophil activation and migration are orchestrated by different stimuli like platelet activating factor (PAF) and its receptor PAFR; the chemokine CXCL8 (CXCL1/2 in mice) and its receptor CXCR1/2; the anaphylatoxin C5a and others. The aim of this investigation was to test 4 potential pharmacological strategies modulating the host inflammatory response using compounds with different targets involved in neutrophil activation and migration for their ability to improve disease outcomes in murine influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infection models. Key measurements in the reported studies include assessing neutrophil cell counts in the BALF and lungs of infected mice, viral and/or bacterial loads, histopathology scores in the lungs, weight loss, and lethality rates. For the first target, PAFR, a PAFR antagonist, (PCA 4248 from ToCris Bioscience Co.), given by oral gavage twice a day from day 3 to day 7 after infection reduced weight loss and protected mice from lethal influenza infection improving survival by 40 percent at day 21. PCA 4248 reduced neutrophil transmigration to the airways and consequent lung pathology at days 5 and 7 after infection. For the second target, C5a, a tick saliva derived protein that blocks C5 cleavage into C5a (OmCl), was given intraperitoneally from day 0 to day 5. OmCl was able to reduce C5a levels, which reduces neutrophil transmigration to airways, release of neutrophil extracellular traps and consequent lung pathology after influenza A infection.",

Treatment with DF2162 during influenza infection was reported to reduce neutrophil transmigration to airways and consequent lung pathology after influenza infection. In addition, DF2162 given from day 3 to day 7 after influenza infection protected mice from secondary (14 days after influenza) Streptococcus pneumoniae morbidity by reduction of neutrophil infiltration in the lungs and bacteremia in mice. In a fourth approach, the use of steroids during influenza infection was examined. The corticosteroid dexamethasone was given alone or in combination with suboptimal doses of oseltamivir starting at day 0 or day 3 until day 10 after infection. Reduced lethality was observed when dexamethasone was given therapeutically (initiated at day 3 post-infection) but not when given prophylactically (Day 0). In all cases, the ability of the host to deal with the infection seen by lymphocyte numbers and/or viral titers in the lungs was unchanged. In conclusion, these compounds targeting different steps of neutrophil activation and migration have an important therapeutic potential that should be investigated in humans.",

One approach is to directly target host factors involved in essential viral functions without causing major effects to the host cell. The influenza A virus genome contains 8 vRNA segments. vRNA segment 7 codes for the matrix protein M1 which has splice variants. M1 mRNA is also alternatively spliced to encode the M2 ion channel. It has previously been shown that post-transcriptional splicing of the full-length M1 mRNA occurs at nuclear speckles, which are specialized storage sites for splicing factors inside the nucleus. M1 and M2 mRNAs are then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. The M1 and M2 proteins are necessary for viral trafficking and generation of new viral particles. Since most cellular mRNAs are not spliced at nuclear speckles, inhibiting the splicing of the viral M mRNA presents a possible avenue for development of new classes of antiviral inhibitors. A high throughput chemical screen was performed starting with 232,500 compounds to identify small molecule effectors of viral mRNA splicing and nuclear export using a multistep approach. Compounds showing strong inhibition of M mRNA splicing and nuclear export but no activity toward bulk poly(A) RNA nuclear export and no toxicity to host cells were identified. Two influenza inhibitors were identified with different phenotypes. One compound inhibited a subset of influenza strains while the other presented broad antiviral activity and provided a promising lead for further drug development.",

VH244 is modeled on defective interfering influenza viral particles that occur in nature and typically contain a highly deleted form of the viral genome which are unable to replicate. VH244 is being developed for the treatment of multiple respiratory viral infections. The effective moiety is derived from segment 1 of influenza A and is a truncated 395 nucleotide RNA packaged within a viral particle derived from influenza A PR8 (H1N1). VH244 enters host cells efficiently but results in a non-productive infection because it cannot replicate, lacking a full-length segment 1 encoding an essential component of the RNA polymerase complex. VH244 significantly reduces replication of respiratory viruses in vitro by two separate mechanisms of action: 1) a pan-respiratory viral infection activity against other respiratory viruses including influenza B, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), RSV, and human rhinovirus (HRV) through stimulation of host innate immunity and activation of the cell antiviral state and 2) against influenza A through genomic interference.",

Later administration at day 4 provided less protection from disease and weight loss and no efficacy when given starting at day 5 post-infection. VH244 also demonstrated a high barrier to emergence of viral drug resistance after prolonged in vivo passaging experiments. The expanded therapeutic window of protection offers the possibility that VH244 may provide effective treatment of respiratory viral infection even when treatment is delayed.

Potent and selective M2-1 chemical inhibitors were identified after a series of elegant mode of action studies with RSV reporter constructs, a mutant RSV virus with a single point mutation in M2-1, and evaluation of a series of chemical probes based on cyclopamine. Cyclopamine is a steroidal alkaloid and smoothened receptor (Smo) antagonist which inhibits RSV replication, but it also has undesirable off-target effects interacting with the hedgehog pathway which impacts important biological processes of the host cell. To address this issue, chemical analogues of cyclopamine were designed using the structure of cyclopamine-Smo, were synthesized and tested to determine if the anti-RSV activity [RSV(+)] could be separated from the unwanted Smo-mediated signaling activity. The compounds were tested for inhibition of essential functions in RSV replication such as the formation of inclusion body associated granules (IBAGS). Time-of-addition studies with cyclopamine showed that it targets the post-entry phase of viral replication, reduces transcription of downstream genes in RSV replication and IBAG formation is disrupted. Several Smo(\u2212)/RSV(+) molecules were identified and were able to specifically suppress RSV lung infection in the mouse model in a dose-dependent and M2-1-specific manner. Target validation studies of the M2-1 were conducted using the RSV mini-replicon system, reverse genetics of recombinant RSV expressing the luciferase reporter gene and a mutant RSV virus with a single R151K mutation in M2-1.

Prior guidance from the FDA has noted a \u201csingle best endpoint has not been identified in seriously ill hospitalized patients\u201d and \u201csponsors are encouraged to provide evidence for the ability of their proposed endpoint to directly measure how a patient feels, functions, or survives\u201d (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2011). In order to construct these endpoints, we need to better categorize severity of disease in those hospitalized with a respiratory virus. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was developed in the United Kingdom for identifying patients at risk for deterioration or escalation of care. Several studies have used or proposed using NEWS to define a population with severe influenza, but this score has not been validated for this purpose. A retrospective study was conducted at Northwestern University Hospital evaluating 315 patients hospitalized with influenza, and were categorized by NEWS (1\u20133, 4\u20136, >6) and an ordinal scale of clinical outcomes (death, in the ICU on a mechanical ventilator, in the ICU but not on a mechanical ventilator, hospitalized on supplemental oxygen, hospitalized not on supplemental oxygen, discharge but has not resumed normal activities, and discharged with resumption of normal activities). Prior studies had demonstrated early treatment led to better clinical outcomes, and this was used as a surrogate for therapeutic benefit from antivirals in the current analysis. When analyzed using an ordinal scale endpoint, a higher baseline NEWS was associated with greater but later therapeutic benefit from neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) based treatment. However, recruitment may be affected as there were fewer numbers of patients as the NEWS increased (Ison, 2016).",

In addition to standardized forms, data from digital health technology can also be used to collect COAs.

To assist in this process, the FDA published the Guidance for Industry, Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2009).

Is it reproducible within and across raters? To assist in answering these questions, the FDA has developed several pathways for assessment, review and advice, whether the planned development program is for an individual drug; or for the development of novel COAs for use in multiple programs. One pathway is the Critical Path Innovation Meetings where, general non-binding advice can be sought on a specific methodology or technology in its early stages of development (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018).

Influenza is seasonal, meaning that for each season enrollment per clinical site is limited to approximately six weeks, with peak activity covering only two weeks on average. Additionally, more than one third of hospital clinical sites do not enroll a single patient and another quarter enroll only one or two subjects (Beigel et al., 2017; de Jong et al., 2014; Marty et al., 2017). To facilitate adequate enrollment, a large number of sites across the globe are required to complete the study in a timely manner. However, global variability in clinical care and standard of care (SOC) poses considerable challenges to study design, interpretation, and generalizability. Another challenge occurs when enrollment spans multiple seasons making it difficult to compare across varying strains with differing clinical presentations. In addition, there is no agreed upon clinical endpoint for hospitalized influenza clinical studies. The poor correlation between a viral load and clinical symptoms, makes a clinical endpoint (rather than a virologic endpoint) more logical. However, the subjective nature of a clinical endpoint, along with variability in SOC requirements and regional differences in quality of healthcare makes it harder to determine the real effect of a treatment. Furthermore, in many countries, Institutional Review Boards (Ethics Committees) require that a hospital-based phase 3 clinical trial use SOC (oseltamivir) in addition to the investigational drug compared to SOC alone (Yang et al., 2012). Therefore, investigational drugs must demonstrate superiority to oseltamivir to meet the endpoints for the study.",

The approach taken to identify a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate was outlined. Initially, a high throughput screening (HTS) assay using a library containing 180,000 compounds was screened against a validated replication-competent influenza A virus (IAV) reporter virus. This screening yielded a broad spectrum ribonucleoside inhibitor (EIDD-1931) which has activity against RSV and influenza. EIDD-1931 was used in further rounds of testing against a panel of laboratory-adapted and clinical strains representing RSV, IAVs, and influenza B viruses (IBVs) in both established cell lines and primary human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells (HBTECs). It was shown that EIDD-1931 has activity against influenza A group 1 and 2 strains, including pathogenic avian influenza isolates and influenza B in sub-micromolar range. The putative mechanism of action is the induction of virus error catastrophe (inability to replicate as a result of excessive mutations). Experimental data shows that it has a high barrier against resistance as there were no resistant viruses identified after ten passages and deep sequencing of the virus populations.",

Efficacy testing using the ferret model of influenza infection demonstrated low toxicity and potent efficacy of the EIDD-2801 pro-drug, outlining a broad therapeutic window. Initial dosing at 100 mg/kg either prophylactically or when administered 24 post exposure showed a reduction in viral load of several orders of magnitude in nasal lavages. EIDD-2801 was then dosed 24 h post infection at 20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg and tested against influenza A group 1 and 2 strains and influenza B strains. This resulted in an equivalent reduction in viral load (>4 orders of magnitude) within 12 h of administration of the first dose. Clinical signs, fever and airway tissue damage, were significantly alleviated. Application of pharmacokinetic profiles to in vitro studies of well-differentiated 3D human air-liquid interface airway epithelium models revealed sterilizing efficacy and toxicity thresholds in primary human tissues, informing prediction of drug concentration targets for clinical trial (Yoon et al., 2018).",

The goal of these studies was to ascertain if treating severely ill influenza positive patients with 3-fold increase in the oseltamivir dose would show clinical benefit. This was an open label study and 27 influenza-positive patients in an ICU on mechanical ventilation were randomized. The treatment groups consisted of 13 and 14 patients and they received either a double (150 mg) or a triple dose (225 mg) of oseltamivir, respectively. The primary outcome was the rate of viral clearance (day 5) with secondary outcome given as 28-day mortality. Most of the patients were influenza A positive with a bacterial coinfection and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) severity score greater than 20. Some difficulties were encountered in recruiting patients due to high rates of renal failure. The results from the study showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in either the primary or secondary endpoints. A small difference in the viral load in the nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates was observed with the higher dose of oseltamivir, however this difference was not statistically significant.

A murine model was developed to recapitulate the chronic infections observed in immunocompromised patients, and test investigational and approved therapeutic agents. Genetically modified immunocompromised BALB scid mice infected with influenza B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008) display susceptibility to infection and persistent viral replication recapitulating chronic infection. The efficacy of a representative NAI (peramivir) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (favipiravir) was assessed using BALB/c and BALB scid mice (Pascua et al., 2017). Starting 24 h post-infection, peramivir (75 mg/kg/day) was administered to mice intramuscularly (IM) once every other day with groups receiving single, double or quadruple doses. Favipiravir was administered orally 10, 50 or 250 mg/kg/day twice daily for 5 or 10 days. It was observed that most of the control BALB/c mice succumbed to infection while those treated with peramivir survived. For scid mice, 60% of those animals that received 2 or 4 doses of peramivir survived compare to 40% for the one-dose-treated group. Virus replication was examined in the lungs and nasal turbinates in the one- and two-dose groups. Peramivir suppressed virus replication in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) but required two treatments to suppress replication in the nasal turbinates in BALB/c mice. In contrast peramivir did not suppress viral replication in the turbinates or lungs of the scid mice. BALB/c mice treated with a 50 mg/kg/day dose of favipiravir significantly increased survival rates and suppressed viral replication in the lung. However, suppression of viral replication in the nasal turbinates was only observed in those animals dosed at 250 mg/kg/day. For scid mice, administration of 50 and 250 mg/kg/day resulted in 100% survival and similar trends were observed in the effectiveness at suppressing viral replication in the nasal turbinates. Neither agent was able to suppress replication in the upper respiratory tract. The establishment of an immunocompromised murine models for influenza B virus infection will facilitate evaluations of the efficacy of currently available and investigational anti-influenza drugs in immunocompromised populations (Pascua et al., 2017).",

To assess the impact of polymorphisms within the HA epitope the sequences of currently circulating strains, covering the years 2015 through 2017, were obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID) database. Approximately 40,000 influenza A H1 and H3 sequences were analyzed for changes in the VIS410 epitope. Mostly there were no changes in amino acid frequency that were above 2% at positions that comprise the VIS410 epitope. However, a change in the A(H1N1) HA at position HA2 45 from L to V was observed at low frequency in the last season. Full length HAs were cloned and expressed on the surface of 293 cells to facilitate binding analysis using flow cytometry.

The immune response to two of the vaccine candidates was assessed in mice for their ability to elicit broadly reactive neutralizing serum antibodies. The peptides were conjugated to a carrier protein known as Cross reacting material (CRM), a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin (DT). Peptide 11 CRM-conjugate vaccine was administered subcutaneously as a prime boost with live influenza A(H3N2) (Wuhan) administered intramuscularly at a dose of 106. After priming with live influenza virus on Day 0 and 14, the mice were injected subcutaneously with 20-\u03bcg peptide 11 composite vaccine on days 30, 42, and 70. The immunological response was assessed using individual peptides and viruses including influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2). The initial immunologic response was low, but became more robust over time peaking at day 77. The second subunit vaccine (5906) is a composite vaccine that contains M2e peptide sequences, a tetanus T-cell epitope sequence, and is conjugated to CRM. This vaccine (50 \u03bcg) was administered subcutaneously with no prime boost and the mice were given boosts on days 21, 35 and 41.

Monoclonal antibodies were identified that bound to individual and composite peptides and live viruses, while also showing cross neutralizing potential against influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) in the microneutralization assay. mAb GA4, along with other monoclonal antibodies that bind HA and NA protein, are being evaluated for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity.",

These RCTs have been limited by enrollment of a highly heterogenous hospitalized population, and experienced difficulty in patient enrollment. Use of a standardized assessment to consistently measure the severity-of-illness may help to identify a more homogenous trial population that is seriously ill due to influenza infection. One example of a clinical severity-of-illness scale is the National Early Warning Score (NEWS/NEWS2) (Royal College of Physicians, 2018); however, it still requires prospective evaluation of its use in this population. In addition to the use of a severity-of-illness scale, other eligibility criteria such as use of supplemental oxygen, respiratory support, or other influenza-related conditions may also be useful to target an appropriate trial population for enrollment for which clinical benefit from a therapeutic may be demonstrated.",

Currently approved treatment options in infants are limited to inhaled ribavirin in some EU member states, and palivizumab as prevention for high risk infant subgroups. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recently adopted and published guidance for the clinical evaluation of medicinal products indicated for the prophylaxis or treatment of RSV disease. The guidance covers the development of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of RSV disease and direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for the treatment of RSV disease (European Medicines Agency, 2018). The focus is on the assessment of safety and efficacy in populations most likely to develop RSV LRTI and severe RSV disease, including infants and toddlers (aged 28 days to 23 months) and older adults (e.g. aged \u226560 years). For candidate DAAs, double-blind superiority trials (candidate DAA versus uncontrolled group) based on clinically relevant primary endpoints are currently feasible (this may need reconsideration in the future) It is also essential that there are clear definitions of RSV cases based on a combination of clinical and laboratory criteria.",

New drugs for treatment and prevention should demonstrate broad antiviral activity against diverse RSV strains and sponsors should monitor for the emergence of amino acid substitutions that may confer resistance. Randomized, double-blind, comparative trials should be conducted for both treatment and prevention products. Optimal endpoints have not been established for treatment trials. Phase 2 studies should evaluate a combination of clinical and virologic endpoints, while phase 3 trial endpoints should reflect improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of RSV-associated illness (\u201cfeel, function, and survive\u201d).

In special populations including the immunocompromised (Beaird et al., 2016), it is often delivered in the oral or IV form which generates drug concentrations at sites of RSV replication far lower than needed to inhibit viral replication (Kim et al., 2017). Several potent and selective small molecule antiviral compounds have been identified and have progressed to clinical trials. MDT-637 is a novel RSV fusion inhibitor that may produce a superior clinical effect compared to ribavirin on natural RSV infections (Kim et al., 2017). GS-5806 is another fusion inhibitor that has been shown to decrease viral load and severity of clinical disease (DeVincenzo et al., 2014). ALS-008176 (lumicitabine) is an oral nucleoside analog that demonstrated proof of concept in a human RSV challenge model (DeVincenzo et al., 2015). Finally, PC786 is a nonnucleoside L protein polymerase inhibitor that has undergone preclinical characterization (Coates et al., 2017). Other antivirals are also in clinical development including those representing the fusion inhibitor class and replication inhibitor class. Further understanding of RSV replication kinetics in the individual at-risk populations, as well as virus dynamics in their upper and lower respiratory tract disease, are needed to adroitly design clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of these and other antivirals in clinical settings.",

            "text": "Treatment of patients with MERS has proven challenging, with no specific antiviral therapy of proven efficacy available to date. In one multicenter cohort study that adjusted for time-varying confounders, corticosteroid treatment in MERS-CoV infected patients was not significantly associated with a difference in mortality rates but was associated with delay in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (Arabi et al., 2018b). Treatment with convalescent plasma, while promising is likely not feasible, given the limited pool of potential donors. One study showed that even recovering patients from MERS do not have sufficient antibody titers for therapeutic use (Arabi et al., 2015, 2016). Ribavirin and interferon \u03b12b treatment produced promising preclinical data in rhesus macaques, including moderate reductions in viral load and partially effective prevention of progression to pneumonia when infected animals were compared with untreated infected controls (Falzarano et al., 2013). However, data on MERS-CoV infected patients treated with a combination of ribavirin and interferon (either \u03b12a or \u03b21) have been inconsistent depending on the statistical analysis methods used to compare the datasets (Al Ghamdi et al., 2016; Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014; Omrani et al., 2014; Shalhoub et al., 2018). The largest study that adjusted for time-varying confounders that might influence the decision to initiate ribavirin and interferon therapy did not show an improvement in mortality (Arabi et al., 2017a). Furthermore, the dose of ribavirin required to reduce MERS-CoV replication are often associated with significant toxicities in humans (Hart et al., 2014). Of all interferons tested, interferon \u03b2 was the most effective against MERS-CoV in vitro at doses that were lower than clinical treatment regimens (Chan et al., 2013; Hart et al., 2014). The human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon \u03b1 treatment have been shown to be effective in SARS-CoV infected patients and also reduced weight loss, clinical scores, viral titers and disease progression in MERS-CoV infected marmosets (Chan et al., 2015; Chu et al., 2004; de Wilde et al., 2013). Lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon \u03b2 treatment is now being evaluated in the MIRACLE trial for MERS-CoV infected patients (NCT02845843) and has currently recruited 35 patients from 10 sites (Arabi et al., 2018a).",

Gilead Sciences' nucleotide analog prodrug remdesivir has broad spectrum antiviral activity against filoviruses, paramyxoviruses and highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. Remdesivir has both prophylactic and therapeutic effectiveness for SARS- and MERS-CoV in multiple animal models (Sheahan et al., 2017). Pharmacokinetic studies have already been completed and clinical trials are underway for remdesivir to treat Ebola virus. Future studies should focus on increasing the number of sites where MERS-CoV clinical trials can be conducted, recruiting patients to trials earlier in the infection time course, and the possibility of having a mobile response team to recruit patients anywhere in Saudi Arabia. Finally, additional studies that evaluate the benefits of combination therapies should be performed in hopes of finding ways to both reduce viral replication and strengthen immune responses that reduce disease burden following MERS-CoV infection.",

Ziresovir (AK0529) is a fusion inhibitor, active against RSV A& B, with the EC90 in nanomolar concentrations and no drug resistance in clinical isolates (McKimm-Breschkin et al., 2018). The current VICTOR study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in children 1\u201324 months hospitalized with RSV. Here, the results for the single dose (Part 1) were reported. This was a dose escalation study with doses 0.5\u20134 mg/kg studied. The primary objective is safety and tolerability. There were no SAEs reported, and only 13 AEs reported from 8 patients (no AEs were thought to be dose related). There was a dose dependent decrease in symptom score at 24 h after a single dose of ziresovir. No patient who received ziresovir deteriorated, in contrast to the placebo group. Early results suggest ziresovir has clinical efficacy against RSV. This would be the first antiviral that has shown clinical benefit in infants and in naturally acquired RSV disease. These encouraging results have supported continuation of the phase 2 trial in multi-dose cohorts, which are currently ongoing.",

Phenotypic NAI assays are well-characterized but require a cultivated isolate, which make them inadequate as a point-of-care diagnostic, and they are generally less sensitive for detecting resistant variants in mixed populations (Wetherall et al., 2003); however, newer technologies have attempted to reduce turn-around time and increase the sensitivity of the standard NAI assay (Gubareva et al., 2017). Lack of standardization and a clear relationship between the level of reduced susceptibility and clinical outcomes make phenotypic assays difficult to interpret, but this also is a continuing area of study. Genotypic assays are generally rapid and sensitive, but require prior knowledge of the effect of certain mutations on virus susceptibility. Genotypic assays can vary in scope, from real-time PCR SNP detection to Sanger or \u2018next-generation\u2019 sequencing of whole genes or genomes. The advent of influenza antivirals with distinct mechanisms of action will require new assays and approaches. Phenotypic assays for baloxavir are currently neither rapid nor high-throughput, although advances are currently being made, and the genetic determinants of reduced susceptibility to baloxavir are still being defined. As with all classes of drugs, surveillance will involve the use of genotypic and phenotypic assays to account for the emergence and spread of resistance.",

Oseltamivir treatment was least effective against type B virus infection, which exhibited an IC50 10-fold greater than type A viruses. Among type A viruses, which varied by approximately 3- to 5-fold in IC50 values, there was no clear association between virus shedding reduction and IC50 values. There was no demonstrable antiviral effect of oseltamivir compared to placebo in ferrets infected with viruses with NA resistance substitutions, which had IC50 values ranging from 65.6 to 414.8 nM. Based on a linear regression model of the relationship between infecting virus IC50 value and virus shedding AUC in ferrets, IC50 values > 14.7 nM and >68.4 nM were associated with >50% and >90% reductions in oseltamivir effectiveness, respectively. Large differences in susceptibilities of viruses in a NAI assays may be predictive of impacts of oseltamivir treatment on virus shedding, but how such differences relate to clinical outcomes in humans, and whether smaller differences in susceptibility may be predictive of treatment response, requires additional investigation.",

Viruses with apparent reduced susceptibility were observed after as few as 5 passages, and virus recovered after 16 passages exhibited a 179-fold increase in EC50 value (from 3 nM to 538 nM). The resistant phenotype was maintained after an additional 5 passages in the absence of RO-7 selective pressure, indicating the fitness cost of reduced susceptibility to RO-7 may be limited. Sequencing of PA revealed a single amino acid substitution: I38T, which has also been selected by baloxavir acid in cell culture (Byrn et al., 2015), and is to date the most frequently observed treatment-emergent resistance substitution in baloxavir marboxil-treated patients (Omoto et al., 2018). Co-crystallization of RO-7 and the PA N-terminal region, which contains the endonuclease domain, revealed that the I38T disrupts a strong hydrophobic interaction between RO-7 and the binding pocket. Isothermal calorimetry of the PA protein in the presence of RO-7 revealed a nearly 500-fold reduction in the KD of RO-7 binding to PA (9.5 nM\u20134600 nM) associated with the I38T substitution.",

The plaque assay is well characterized and robust, but depends on visualization of the cytopathic effect of virus spreading among neighboring cells and requires several days of incubation for plaques to form that are large enough to visualize. In addition, some viruses are not highly cytopathic.

There were no clear outliers indicative of significantly reduced susceptibility, and all viruses expressed wild-type PA I38; however, the limited variation in EC50 values observed could be driven by other viral genetic determinants.

However, drug-resistant influenza viruses can become transmissible and spread widely; it is essential to monitor drug susceptibility among seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses.",

Most cell culture-based assays are slow and cumbersome, requiring multiple rounds of virus replication. To facilitate surveillance efforts, the CDC laboratory has developed a single-cycle assay: high-content imaging-based neutralization test (HINT). In this assay, MDCK-SIAT1 cells are infected with influenza virus in the absence of trypsin to limit virus spread. After 16\u201324 h of incubation, cells are fixed, immuno-fluorescently stained with anti-NP antibody, and imaged using an automated fluorescent cell counter. Baloxavir EC50 values measured using the HINT assay were within approximately 2-fold of values obtained by focus reduction and plaque reduction assays (Omoto et al., 2018). The HINT assay revealed that the PA-I38L substitution, detected in two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, but as yet un-characterized, conferred a 7-fold reduction in baloxavir susceptibility, which is comparable to the 10-fold reduction observed for the previously characterized treatment-emergent I38M substitution (Omoto et al., 2018). For pimodivir, the HINT EC50 values were 8-fold higher than EC50 values determined by focus reduction assay; nevertheless, the fold changes conferred by PB2-S324C and S324R substitutions remained consistent between two assays. The HINT assay provides a higher throughput option for phenotypic surveillance of seasonal and other low pathogenic influenza viruses; HINT does not work with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. As the HINT assay is not yet available for influenza C and D viruses, their susceptibility to baloxavir was assessed using the virus yield reduction assay. Baloxavir potently inhibited replication of all viruses tested and showed the highest activity against type A and the lowest (\u223c8-fold) against influenza D viruses.",

Such determinants have not been yet been identified, although the rate of treatment-emergent substitutions is far higher in type A influenza virus compared to type B influenza virus. It is not clear if this difference in rates between influenza virus types is driven primarily by reduced activity of baloxavir against type B virus or a greater fitness cost of resistance in type B virus.",

The SARS-CoV/bat-CoV spike viruses were evaluated in cell lines expressing either the human, bat, or civet angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, cellular receptor) to determine host species specificity, and to identify candidate bat-CoV strains to generate infectious clones based on the entire bat coronavirus genome. Four of the six SARS-CoV/bat-CoV spike viruses tested could use all three ACE2 molecules for entry and replicated to high titers (>106 plaque forming units/mL) (Becker et al., 2008; Menachery et al., 2015; Rockx et al., 2007). These four bat coronavirus strains were then isolated from infectious clones derived from their respective genomes and the resulting virus progeny used to characterize replication kinetics in immortalized cell lines and primary human lung cell cultures and to perform in vivo vaccination or treatment experiments in comparison to wild type SARS-CoV. SHC014 and WIV1 replicated to high titers, the same titers as wild type SARS-CoV, in primary lung cell cultures suggesting that these strains were fully competent to infect humans. In murine disease models of highly pathogenic human coronavirus infection the bat coronavirus strains were attenuated in comparison to wild type mouse adapted SARS-CoV. Vaccination studies demonstrated that vaccines specific for SARS-CoV were not effective against the bat coronavirus strains and antibody treatments that were protective for SARS-CoV failed against the bat strains (Becker et al., 2008; Menachery et al., 2015; Rockx et al., 2007, 2008). These data highlight how crucial it is to evaluate all treatment options on more than just the current and past human strain(s) and SARS- and MERS-CoV so that appropriate treatment and vaccination strategies are stock piled to be prepared for future epidemics.",

Remdesivir pharmacokinetic studies have been completed and this compound is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for Ebola virus efficacy (NCT03719586). Nucleotide/side analogues including remdesivir were tested to determine if they were effective against highly pathogenic human coronaviruses despite previous studies demonstrating that nucleotide analogues generally have poor activity against coronaviruses due to the proofreading enzyme that is part of the viral replication machinery. Studies in human lung cell lines and primary human lung epithelial cell cultures demonstrated that remdesivir is effective against both SARS- and MERS-CoV as well as the pre-epidemic bat-CoV strains described earlier (Sheahan et al., 2017). In parallel, in vitro passage studies were also performed to determine if coronavirus genomes could evolve to replicate in the presence of remdesivir. After 23 passages in the presence of drug, two mutations were identified in the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene (F276L and V553L) that allowed for increased replication in the presence of remdesivir (Agostini et al., 2018). These two amino acid changes decrease viral fitness overall and attenuate SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model of SARS-CoV induced disease (Agostini et al., 2018). In both prophylactic and therapeutic (24 h post infection) dosing regimens of SARS-CoV infected animals, remdesivir treated animals had a >2 log reduction in viral titers by Day 4 or 5 post infection (Sheahan et al., 2017). Remdesivir treated animals also maintained their starting weight throughout the infection time course while vehicle treated animals lost 20% of their starting weight by Day 4 or 5 post infection (Sheahan et al., 2017). Finally, improved lung function (less airway constriction and reduced times between breaths) was seen when treated animals were compared to SARS-CoV infected untreated control animals (Sheahan et al., 2017). Similar results were seen with MERS-CoV in prophylactic dosing studies performed in the Baric laboratory's MERS-CoV mouse model (Cockrell et al., 2016). In contrast, therapeutic treatment with human monoclonal antibodies did not protect against MERS-CoV induced severe disease or protect from loss of lung function in animal models of highly pathogenic human coronavirus disease (Cockrell et al., 2016). Remdesivir is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral that may prove useful in the treatment of highly pathogenic human coronavirus.",

A wide range of compounds have been evaluated for activity against highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including biologics and small molecules. Among them, nucleotide analog remdesivir showed potent activity against coronaviruses (reviewed above in the Baric and Arabi summaries). Remdesivir is currently being evaluated in a randomized clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Ebola virus disease (NCT03719586). The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is an FDA approved antiviral for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (Croxtall and Perry, 2010; Perry et al., 2016). Previous studies on the antiviral activity of lopinavir against MERS-CoV are conflicting with one study reporting micromolar EC50 values in a human hepatoma cell line (Huh 7) yet another reported that lopinavir had no activity in a non-human primate kidney cell line (Vero) (Chan et al., 2013; de Wilde et al., 2014). Type I interferons are approved for treating multiple indications including hepatitis B and C, and multiple sclerosis (Dumitrescu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018). Two studies showed interferon-beta was effective against MERS-CoV infection in non-human primate kidney cells (Vero) with EC50 values < 10 IU/mL (Chan et al., 2013; Hart et al., 2014). Clinical observations and in vivo animal models indicate outcomes of MERS-CoV infection are mediated by both virus replication and the resultant host inflammatory response, so combination therapies directly targeting both the virus and host may represent the best course of treatment for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. As such, the cocktail of lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-beta is currently being evaluated in patients infected with MERS-CoV in the MIRACLE trial (Arabi et al., 2018a).",

Infected and mock-infected human lung epithelial cells (Calu 3) were treated with dilution series of lopinavir (50 \u03bcM\u20130.05 \u03bcM), ritonavir (50 \u03bcM\u20130.05 \u03bcM), interferon-beta (2800 IU/mL to 5.5 IU/mL), or remdesivir (10 \u03bcM\u20130.02 \u03bcM) and results were assayed 48 h post infection. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in non-infected cells and EC50 values were determined for each drug. Both lopinavir and ritonavir demonstrated moderate to minimal inhibition of virus replication with respective EC50 values of 10 and 34 \u03bcM. Interferon-beta treatment of MERS-CoV infected human lung epithelial cells inhibited viral replication similar to previous studies in non-human primate kidney cells (Vero) (Chan et al., 2013; Hart et al., 2014); however, the EC50 value in our studies was higher (175 IU/mL in human lung cells and <10 IU/mL in non-human primate kidney cells). In contrast, remdesivir potently inhibited MERS-CoV replication with sub-micromolar EC50 (0.11 \u03bcM) (Sheahan et al., 2017). To facilitate in vivo efficacy studies with MERS-CoV in rodents, a mouse model was generated through the humanization of the murine ortholog of the human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Cockrell et al., 2016) in conjunction with the genetic deletion of carboxyl esterase 1 (Ces1c\n\u2212/\u2212) to minimize rodent serum esterase-specific remdesivir degradation (Sheahan et al., 2017). The dosage for the combination of lopinavir (160 mg/kg, QD) and ritonavir (40 mg/kg, QD) were based on human equivalent dose using body surface area. Mouse recombinant interferon-beta was dosed at two concentrations (1.6 \u00d7 106 and 4 \u00d7 107 IU/kg, QD) to cover 1x and 25x human equivalent doses, respectively. Dosage of remdesivir (25 mg/kg BID) was chosen based on pharmacokinetic studies performed in Ces1c\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Sheahan et al., 2017). When treatment was initiated one day post infection (dpi) with mouse adapted MERS-CoV, lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-beta treatment did not reduce levels of virus replication as compared to their vehicle controls 6 dpi, while remdesivir treatment reduced viral titers by 3 logs relative its vehicle controls. These findings support the potential clinical development of remdesivir as a MERS-CoV antiviral.",

Nasal wash titers were \u223c0.5 log10 lower on 4 dpi in the PA-I38M-infected animals. No reversion from methionine to isoleucine at residue 38 in the PA protein was detected at any time point by pyrosequencing analysis. To get additional insights into replicative capacity of the wild type vs PA-I38M virus, a competitive growth experiment was carried out, where ferrets were co-inoculated with both viruses at ratios of 70:30, 30:70 or 10:90 at a total of 10\u02c63 PFU. Pyrosequencing analysis of virus populations in nasal washes collected over a 7-day period revealed an incremental reduction in the proportion of the PA-I38M virus population.

A randomized controlled trial conducted shortly after the emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 randomized thirty-five participants to receive high titer anti-influenza immune immunoglobulin (IVIG) or non-immune pre-pandemic IGIV (Hung et al., 2013). 29% of those receiving immune IGIV died compared to 24% of those receiving standard IGIV (p = not significant), though benefit was reported in a post hoc analysis of the 22 participants who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset. FLU-IVIG was an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled in adults hospitalized with laboratory confirmed influenza who had a NEWS \u22652. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single infusion of anti-influenza high titer IVIG or saline placebo, and all participants were to receive standard NAI treatment. Outcome was measured by a 6-point ordinal scale of clinical status on Day 7.",

A prior randomized, phase 2 study in those with severe influenza A or B demonstrated the resolution of hypoxia and tachypnea by Day 28 in 67% of those receiving plasma vs 53% in the standard care arm (p = 0.069 (Beigel et al., 2017)). This study, however, had differences in baseline characteristics of the study groups, and an asymmetrical loss to follow up between the two study groups possibly due to the unblinded study design.",

As previously noted, the high mortality rates in emerging diseases such as novel coronavirus infectious (MERS and SARS) and novel avian influenza strains (influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)) have raised questions about the possible role of pro-inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis. Prior studies demonstrated cytokine hyperactivation associated with uncontrolled viral replication; and a sustained inflammatory state correlates with disease progression leading to respiratory failure and ARDS. Therapeutics targeting the pathogen alone have thus far largely unsuccessful in reversing such processes.",

Corticosteroids are associated with increased risk of superinfection, prolonged viral replication, and increased risk of death, and should not be used (Rodrigo et al., 2016). For most other adjunctive therapies, the data is less clear. The areas where adjunctive therapies have some supporting data and may be worth further studies were then reviewed. The combination of oseltamivir and azithromycin had been shown to downregulate the proinflammatory cytokines, without impairing viral clearance in one small RCT (Lee et al., 2017). The triple combination of oseltamivir, clarithromycin, and naproxen was demonstrated to reduce adverse outcomes in another study (Hung et al., 2017), but these findings, though intriguing, should be confirmed. Sirolimus has been used with apparent benefit in critically ill influenza patients in the context of an RCT (Wang et al., 2014), confirmatory studies of this approach without concomitant corticosteroid therapy can be explored. The efficacy of other agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), statins, nitazoxanide (NTZ), IFNs, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonists, cyclooxygenase (COX 2) inhibitors, recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), diltiazem, and herbal medicine, all have some supporting preclinical or clinical data, but these need to be studied more intensely, preferably by RCTs (Hui et al., 2018).",
