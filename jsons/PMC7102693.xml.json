            "text": "Cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) are native to North America and were used by Native Americans to treat bacterial infections [11\u2022]. The phytochemicals associated with cranberry bioactivity include flavonoids, phenolic acid derivatives, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, organic acids, and isoprenoids (including ursolic acid and lutein) [12]. Cranberries have a high content of oligomeric and polymeric pigments, also referred to as condensed non-hydrolyzable tannins or proanthocyanidins [13]. Cranberry proanthocyanidins (CPAC) consist primarily of epicatechin tetramers and pentamers with at least one A-type linkage [20]. The proanthocyanidin content of raw cranberries can average 410 mg/100 g fresh fruit weight [3]. In addition, 100% cranberry juice contains tannins at concentrations as high as 0.13 g/L [14]. Cranberry phenolics possess antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities, with health benefits that include anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties [3].",

These researchers also attempted to understand the mechanism of action of CPAC, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and showed slight structural changes for FCV-F9 treated with CJ and CPAC. To understand effects of CJ and CPAC on virus binding to host cells, cell monolayers treated for 1 h with CJ (pH 7) or 0.3 mg/ml CPAC, followed by FCV-F9 or MNV-1 infection, were not reported to show any reduction in FCV-F9 titers, while MNV-1 titers were reported to be reduced by 0.51 and 0.91 log PFU/ml with 50% CJ and 0.3 mg/ml CPAC, respectively [16]. When these researchers first infected CRFK and RAW cells with FCV-F9 and MNV-1 to determine effects on replication, followed by treatment with CJ at 50% and 0.3 mg/ml CPAC for 1 h, FCV-F9 titers were reduced by 0.43 and 0.44 log PFU/ml, respectively, while MNV-1 titers were reduced by 0.80 and 0.42 log PFU/ml, respectively. Thus, they concluded that CJ and CPAC showed some modest effects on both MNV-1 adsorption and replication. These data along with the infectivity data, confirmed that CJ and CPAC show some antiviral effects against the tested HNoV surrogates.",

However, concentrations lower than 10% produced no significant reduction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed that CJ-treated phage T4 was unable to attach to bacterial host cells. CJ at 20% concentration was also shown to completely inhibit hemagglutination of simian rotavirus [17]. These researchers proposed that CJ led to alterations in glycoprotein moieties, resulting in failure of virus binding to the host-cell receptors. They also showed that CJ and CPAC had antiviral activity against waterborne rotavirus SA-11 and bovine reovirus [17]. Rotavirus SA-11 treated with cranberry extracts had single-shelled or anomalous virus-like particles, while the control samples contained the typical double-shelled, icosahedral \u2018wheel-like\u2019 particles by TEM. Additionally, they reported that pretreatment of MA-104 host cell monolayers with a concentration of 5% NC-90 (NutriCran-90\u2122) and NC-100 (NutriCran-100\u2122) extracts (cranberry cocktail) reduced reovirus infectivity titers to \u223c50% of control, while commercial CJ cocktail caused only 10% reduction [17]. Earlier, in vitro studies using polio virus type 1 treated with a cranberry drink at pH 2.6 (natural pH) and 7.0 demonstrated maintenance of 21% and less than 1% poliovirus infectivity, respectively [18].",

They also showed that pretreatment of host cell monolayers with PJ or PP for 45 min, followed by FCV-F9 or MNV-1 infection, resulted in 1.05 and 0.40 log PFU/ml reduction of FCV-F9 with 20% PJ and 0.4 mg/ml PP, respectively, and 0.55 and 0.29 log PFU/ml reduction of MNV-1 with 30% PJ and 0.8 mg/ml PP, respectively. These slightly higher reductions with pretreatment of cells suggested that PJ bioactives and PP may block viral binding to host-cells to some degree. Using ELISA, cranberry and pomegranate juices were shown to reduce the specific binding ability of HNoV P particles of GII.4 [27]. This is in agreement with earlier reported work using cranberry and pomegranate juices and their extracts against HNoV surrogates [25, 26].",

            "text": "In a study that evaluated four flavonoids associated with citric and other fruits (myricetin, L-epicatechin, tangeretin, and naringenin) against HNoV surrogates, FCV-F9 at low titers was found to be reduced to undetectable levels by 0.5 mM and 1 mM myricetin, and by 1.4 log PFU/ml with 0.5 mM L-epicatechin after 2 h at 37 \u00b0C [40]. It was also shown that FCV-F9 at high titers was decreased by 3.17 and 0.72 log PFU/ml with myricetin and L-epicatechin at 1 mM, respectively and by 1.73 log PFU/ml with 0.5 mM myricetin. However, MNV-1 was not reported to be reduced by these flavonoids at the tested concentrations. These results suggest that the antiviral effects of the tested flavonoids were dependent on the flavonoid concentration, virus type, and virus titer [40]. However, since these phytochemicals at the concentrations studied did not show any significant effect on MNV-1, caution is advised when extrapolating these data for HNoV inactivation.",

Plant polyphenols derived from tree barks or that are by-products of the food industry such as GSE show promise for industrial applications due to their decreased cost and availability. Overall, it appears that the tested plant extracts have antiviral activity through destruction of the viral structure and prevention of host-cell binding and/or entry into the host. Though most studies with plant extracts have been conducted in vitro focus should be placed toward application in food systems and environments to control the spread of viral disease.",
