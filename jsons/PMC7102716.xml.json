Human MERS-CoV is believed to have originated via cross-over from dromedary camels, but the major outbreaks experienced in the Middle East and Korea have been healthcare facility\u2013associated and linked to a lack of, or breakdown in, infection prevention and control procedures [5], [6], [9], [10], [11], [12]. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified issues such as overcrowding in emergency department waiting rooms and insufficient attention to basic infection control procedures, such as hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), in hospitals in Saudi Arabia [11]. New infection prevention and control guidelines for MERS-CoV patients were introduced by the Ministry for Health (MOH) in Saudi Arabia, largely based on WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, with modifications based on epidemiological evidence, clinical experience and local circumstances [6], [13], [14], [15], [16].",

However, in order for MOH-prescribed infection prevention and control measures to be effectively implemented in individual healthcare facilities and their constituent departments, clear direction must be given to employees. Expectations of both management and employees should be clearly defined, communicated and understood [1], [7]. The objective of this questionnaire-based study was to gauge staff awareness of infection prevention and control policies and procedures in different healthcare facilities in Saudi Arabia, including government hospitals, private hospitals and poly clinics. The questionnaires were completed by a range of HCWs, including nurses, physicians, laboratory staff and others such as physiotherapists. They addressed staff training and access to information, confidence in the ability of HCWs to implement policies and carry out procedures, their assessment of the main threats in terms of possible outbreak causes and factors contributing to infection spread, and preparedness of their institution to deal with an infection outbreak.",

There was no significant variation on the question of whether their hospital is enrolled in the national surveillance system (Question 6; Chi square 8.015; p = 0.237; Table 2, Appendix B). On this question, there were uniformly high levels of uncertainty across the groups, with an overall level of \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 answers of 35.09% (Table 2). By contrast, on the question of whether there was a list of reportable infectious agents available in their unit and accessible to all staff (Question 7), there was significant variation (Table 2; Chi square 23.58; p = 0.000624; Table 2, Appendix B). This was largely due to the higher than expected levels of nurses reporting positively compared to other groups. It was also attributable to the high levels of uncertainty (don\u2019t know percentages) of both laboratory and other staff compared to both physicians and nurses (Table 2, Appendix B). Overall, only 46.95% of participants reported that there is an accessible list in their unit (Table 2). On the related question of which infections are reported to the MOH (Question 8), there was again significant variation in responses (Chi square 19.7608; p = 0.00305; Table 2, Appendix B). This was mainly attributable to higher than expected numbers of nurses responding that all infections were reported and lower than expected levels of \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 answers for nurses compared to the other groups, and to higher than expected levels of uncertainty among lab staff (Table 2, Appendix B). On the question of whether their institution had a known turnaround time of laboratory results for reportable infectious agents (Question 9), there was a substantial level of uncertainty among staff, with overall \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses of 28.99% (Table 2).

On the question of whether their hospital is prepared for any infection outbreak, there were significant differences of opinion (Question 10; Chi square 26.74; p = 0.000162; Table 2, Appendix B). In particular, while the majority of nurses (58.64%) thought their hospital was prepared for an outbreak, only 37.60% of physicians agreed. Overall, only 48.76% of total staff thought their hospital was prepared for an outbreak (Table 2, Appendix B). On the question of whether the surveillance tool used in their institution is effective to prevent or control infection (Question 11) there was no significant variation (Chi square 9.955; p = 0.1265599; Table 2, Appendix B), with an overall \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 response level of 22.24%. On the question of whether all staff in their unit were following promptly infection control policies, rules and guidelines (Question 12), there was a high level of pessimism across the groups, with 54.01% of all staff responding negatively (Table 2). There was significant variation between the groups (Chi square 19.583; p = 0.00328437). This was mainly attributable to the substantially lower than expected numbers of physicians responding positively, and the lower than expected \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses of nurses and higher than expected \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses of physicians on this question (Table 2, Appendix B). On the related question of whether all staff can differentiate between different isolation protocols such as droplet or contact (Question 13), again there was significant variation (Chi square 39.826; p = 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22127; Table 2, Appendix B). This was mainly attributable to the higher than expected number of \u2018yes\u2019 responses and lower number of \u2018no\u2019 responses from nurses and to the opposite trend for physicians (Table 2, Appendix B). Additionally, both the lab and \u2018others\u2019 staff had higher than expected levels of \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses, while nurses had lower than expected levels.

This was mainly attributable to the responses of the poly clinics staff, who had lower than expected levels of \u2018yes\u2019 responses, and higher than expected \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses, compared to government or private hospitals (Table 3, Appendix C). In terms of whether staff had received some form of training or orientation about infection prevention and control, there was also significant variation (Question 2; Chi square 7.0553; p = 0.029373; Table 3, Appendix C). This was mainly due to private hospital staff being less likely than expected to report no training in comparison to the other institution types (Table 3, Appendix C). There were also significantly different levels of awareness between staff at different institutions of whether there was an active infection control team (Question 3; Chi square 32.5774; p < 0.00001).

However, there was variation across the institution types (Chi Square 12.7713; p = 0.012449), mainly due to the private hospitals staff being more likely than expected to respond positively (Table 3, Appendix C).

In all cases, training of staff and effective communication of specific guidelines, policies and procedures are imperative in ensuring implementation. Responses in our study suggested relatively high levels of uncertainty among HCWs on personnel and institution-specific issues, surveillance and reporting standards, and readiness and competence to implement policies and respond to outbreaks. There was evidence of variability between different HCW professions, institution types, age groups, and between Saudi versus non-Saudi staff. Evidence emerged, for example, that many staff were unaware of availability of information on reportable infections in their own units, did not feel they had sufficient training and were not confident that infection control guidelines and procedures were being implemented by colleagues. Staff in private hospitals expressed more confidence than those in government hospitals on a number of issues.

The largest hospital-associated outbreak occurred in a government hospital in Jeddah in 2014, in which illness spread among both hospital patients and HCWs [5], [9], [11], [12]. Other government hospital-based clusters of MERS-CoV cases occurred in Riyadh in 2014 and 2015 [5], [22]. A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation revealed issues such as overcrowding in emergency department waiting rooms, and inconsistent application of basic infection control procedures, such as hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), as factors in MERS-CoV outbreaks in hospitals in Saudi Arabia [11]. In the Jeddah hospital, aggressive improvement in infection control deficiencies resulted in a decline in cases [18]. The MOH introduced new infection prevention and control guidelines for MERS-CoV patients [6], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Many of these guidelines are generally applicable to infection prevention and control for all infectious diseases, with emphasis on standard, contact, droplet and airborne precautions, management of overcrowding, and triaging in the emergency department [6]. The MOH expressed the hope that they would be strictly adhered to by all HCWs and in all healthcare facilities [6].",

While nurses were more likely to be female than male, gender had no impact on responses to any of the questions asked, thus the variation in nurses\u2019 responses did not relate to gender. Physicians were notably more pessimistic than other staff on these points. While staff in private hospitals were more likely to think that staff in their unit were following promptly infection control policies, rules and guidelines, nevertheless positive responses were confined to a minority of staff, and there was no significant difference across institution types on whether staff can differentiate between different isolation protocols such as droplet or contact.

This suggests that the level of staff training is not considered adequate by HCWs to equip them for implementation of infection control and prevention policy and guidelines. Consistent with this, there was a low level of confidence in the preparedness of institutions for any infection outbreak, although staff in private hospitals and nurses in general were more positive. Staff perceive that government hospitals and poly clinics in particular need urgently to address staff training and orientation to ensure effective implementation of MOH guidelines and ensure preparedness for any infection outbreak.",

A combination of advanced and basic infection control measures also reduced transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs in a recent study in a tertiary care institution in Saudi Arabia [17]. However, for effective implementation of MOH-prescribed infection control and prevention measures, consultation of front-line employees is vital, and expectations of both management and employees should be clearly defined, communicated and understood [1], [7]. Understaffing, frequent staff turnover, poor design and infrastructure of facilities and lack of education and training opportunities are factors that can impact on effective infection prevention and control [23]. Consistent with this, in our study staff identified hospital infrastructure and design, lack and shortage of staff and no infection control training program as the top factors contributing to the spread of infection in the hospital. Participants perceived that carelessness of healthcare workers was the main cause of outbreaks. Although this perception may be faulty, the pressures imposed on staff by inadequate nurse/physician to patient ratios, lack of adequate system resources and sub-optimal hospital infrastructure can challenge the ability of staff to consistently and carefully apply infection prevention and control procedures. Furthermore, there was a relatively high level of uncertainty among some staff types, notably physicians and staff in poly clinics, as to existence of infection control policies and guidelines in their unit. This suggests a breakdown in communication of expectations and guidelines. This could contribute to apparent carelessness in application of procedures, as staff are unclear as to what the required procedures are. There was also a strikingly high lack of uncertainty among staff of all HCW professions as to whether their institution had an emerging infectious diseases task force (dealing with outbreaks), and indeed as to whether their institution has ever experienced an outbreak. Uncertainty on these questions was particularly striking among younger staff, suggesting that further training and communication with HCWs in the 18\u201329 year old age group across all professions would be beneficial.",

There was also high uncertainty as to what infections should be reported, with nurses and staff at private hospitals being less uncertain than other staff. Again, younger staff were significantly less certain than staff aged over 45 years old. Lack of certainty on this point may relate to lack of availability of, access to, or awareness of, a list of reportable infectious agents available within units.

For example, increased compliance with hand hygiene practices due to a series of interventions over a five year period was associated with reduction in HC-MRSA and device-associated infections in a Saudi hospital [24]. Also, a suite of advanced infection control measures in addition to basic IC measures resulted in no transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs [17]. The results of our study suggest that HCWs in Saudi Arabia are aware of limitations in infection control and prevention implementation, and of exacerbating factors in their institutions. Multiple steps are needed to facilitate staff in implementation of guidelines and policies and to improve awareness and compliance, for example on hand hygiene compliance in ICU units [7]. Thus, as evident from the responses of staff in our study, the approach to infection prevention and control measures should be multi-factorial and include ongoing provision of education and training, prominent reminders and reliable provision of the materials needed to implement the policies and guidelines, as well as the involvement and support of hospital management [7]. Attention should also be paid to differences in emphases that may be required in different vulnerable units or departments, including the emergency department, inpatient areas, the dialysis unit and outpatient areas [18], [23], [25].",
