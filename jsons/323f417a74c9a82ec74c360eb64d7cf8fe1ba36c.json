COVID-19, the most serious public condition caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes. Unavailability of specific therapeutics or approved vaccine has made the recovery of COVI-19 more troublesome and challenging. The present in silico study aimed to predict a novel chimeric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of coronaviruses. Conserved regions from the homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) were identified through multiple sequence alignment. The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins (S, E, M and N) reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV-1 and bat coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis.",

The alarming situation is that the number of confirmed cases worldwide has exceeded one million by this time. It took more than three months to reach the first 10000 confirmed cases, while required only 12 days to detect the next 100000 cases. The situation is getting worse in European region.

It shares genome similarity with SARS-CoV (79.5%) and bat coronavirus (96%) Zhu et al., 2020) . However, there are still obscured hypothesis regarding the vector or carrier of SARS-CoV-2, though its detection was primarily linked to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood wholesale market (Lu et al., 2020; WHO, 2020) . Though the species of SARS-CoV-1 and bat coronavirus shares sufficient sequence similarities with the COVID-19, the known way mechanism of infection to the host, and the death rate is quite different in case of the novel coronavirus. In addition, there is an evolutionary distance between SARS-CoV-1 and bat coronavirus as well as the COVID-19 (Hu et al., 2018; Wu, 2020b) . Because of high sequence variability of the pathogen, many of the efforts that have been undertaken to develop vaccine against SARS-CoV2, remain unsuccessful . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop vaccines for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 based on the understanding of actual evolutionary ancestral relationship. While some natural metabolites and traditional medication may come up with comfort and take the edge off few symptoms of COVID-19, there is no proof that existing treatment procedures can effectively combat against the diseased condition (WHO, 2020). However, inactivated or live-attenuated forms of pathogenic organisms are usually recommended for the initiation of antigen-specific responses that alleviate or reduce the possibility of host experience with secondary infections (Thompson & Staats, 2011) . Moreover, all of the proteins are not usually targeted for protective immunity, whereas only a few numbers of proteins are necessary depending on the microbes (Tesh et al., 200, Li et al., 2014) . Depending on sufficient antigen expression from experimental assays, traditional vaccine could take 15 years to develop, while sometimes can lead to undesirable consequences (Purcell et al., 2007 , Petrovsky & Aguilar, 2004 .",

In this method, computation analysis towards genomic architecture of pathogenic candidate could predict the antigens of pathogens without the prerequisite to culture the pathogens in lab condition. Although, few pathogens that challenge to develop effective vaccines so far may become possible through such approach (Rappuoli, 2000) which initiates a huge move in the development of vaccine against the deadly pathogens. The strategy included the comprehensive utilization of bioinformatics algorithm or tools to develop epitope based vaccine molecules, though further validation and experimental procedures are also needed (Moxon et al., 2019) . In addition, peptide based subunit vaccines are biologically safer due to the absence of continuous in vitro culture during the production period, and also implies an appropriate activation of immune responses (Purcell et al., 2007; Dudek et al., 2010) . Such immunoinformatic approaches have already been employed by the researchers to design vaccines against a number of deadly pathogens including Ebola virus (Khan et al., 2015) , HIV (Pandey et al., 2018) , Areanaviruses , Marburgvirus , Norwalk virus (Azim et al., 2019b) , Nipah virus (Saha et al., 2017) , influenza virus (Hasan et al., 2019b) and so on. At present, a suitable peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently necessary that could efficiently generate enough immune response to destroy the virus. Hence, the study was designed to develop a chimeric recombinant vaccine against COVID-19 by targeting four major structural proteins of the pathogen, while revealing the evolutionary history of different species of coronavirus based on whole genome and protein domain-based phylogeny.",

Again, more than 20% gaps from the spike protein alignment was removed. PartitionFinder-2.1.1 (Lanfear et al., 2017) indicated the best fit substitution model of the completed genome sequences and the protein sequences. The phylogeny of the whole genome sequences of coronavirus was constructed using both the Maximum Likelihood Method and Bayesian Method.

All other betacoronavirus contains spike receptor binding protein (IPR018548), coronavirus spike glycoprotein hapted receptor 2 domain (IPR027400) and spike receptor binding domain superfamily (IPR036326). SARS-CoV-1 contains an extra domain, namely spike glycoprotein N-terminal domain (IPR032500), which is also present in some the sub-genera (Embecovirus) of Betacoronavirus, but not in COVID-19. One important finding in our study is that the COVID-19 candidates do not contain the domain spike glycoprotein (IPR042578), which is present in the SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 3) . The secondary structure prediction study shows a large numbers of cysteine residues which contribute to the formation of disulfide bonds within the spike protein. Most of them fall within the S1 spike protein, which is 654 amino acid long in SARS-CoV-1, while 672 amino acids long in COVID-19. The RGD motif which is conserved within the COVID-19 is present in the vicinity of the S1 protein. It exists as KGD that clearly demonstrates the mutation over the short time period. Again, the receptor binding domain and receptor binding motif analyses disclose variations within several region between the COVID19 and SARS-CoV-1 (Supplementary File 2). The domain-based phylogenetic analysis reflects two main divisions, where the all the novel betacoronavirus i.e., COVID19 form clade with the SARS-CoV-1; while other betacoronavirus fall in another clade which further divide to give rise different sub-genera. This clearly shows that the COVID-19 exerts specific ancestral connection to the SARS-CoV-1 in terms of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, our study also revealed close relatedness of both the SARS-CoV-1 and COVID-19 to the bat betacoronavirus that belongs to the Hibecovirus sub-genus. However, in our study, the bat coronaviruses of Nobecovirus subgenus did not fall into the same clade of novel coronaviruses. The phylogenetic study and MSA also revealed that, the functional portion of the spike glycoprotein domain and spike glycoprotein N-terminal domain might be lost from the COVID-19 during the course of evolution.",

The new species has been renamed as 2019-nCoV or, SARS-CoV-2, already causing considerable number infections and deaths in China, Italy, Spain, Iran, USA and to a growing degree throughout the world. The major outbreak and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 forced the scientific community to make considerable investment and research activity for developing a vaccine against the pathogen. However, owing to high infectivity and pathogenicity, the culture of SARS-CoV-2 needs biosafety level 3 conditions, which may obstructed the rapid development of any vaccine or therapeutics. It had been found that about 35 companies and academic institutions are engaged in such works (Spinney et al., 2020 , Ziady et al., 2020 . Among the potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the pipeline, four have nucleic acid based designs, four involve non-replicating viruses or protein constructs, two contain live attenuated virus and one involves a viral vector (Pang et al., 2020) , while only one, called mRNA-1273 (developed by NIAID collaboration with Moderna, Inc.), has confirmed to start phase-1 trial (NIH, 2020) . However, in this study we emphasized on a different approaches by prioritizing the advantages of different genome and proteome database using the immunoinformatic approach. Computational vaccine predictions were adopted by the researchers to design vaccines against both MERS-CoV (Sudhakar et al., 2013; Fernando et al., 2013) and SARS-CoV-1 (Yang et al., 2003; Oany et al., 2014) , targeting the outer membrane or functional proteins (Sharmin and Islam, 2014) . Several in silico strategies have also been employed to predict potential T cell and B cell epitopes against SARS-CoV-2, either emphasizing on spike glycoprotein or envelope proteins (Behbahani, 2020; Rasheed et al., 2020) . None of the studies, however, focused on other structural proteins. Moreover, random genetic changes and mutations in the protein sequences (Yin, 2020) may obstruct the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against human coronavirus in the future.",

Cytotoxic CD8+T lymphocytes (CTL) play a crucial role to control the spread of pathogens by recognizing and killing diseased cells or by means of antiviral cytokine secretion (Garcia et al., 1999) . Thus, T cell epitope-based vaccination is a unique process to confer defensive response against pathogenic candidates (Shrestha, 2004) . Approximately 800 MHC-I peptides (CTL epitopes) and 600 MHC-II peptides (HTL epitopes) were predicted via IEDB server, from which we screened the top ones through analyzing the antigenicity score, transmembrane topology, conservancy level and other important physiochemical parameters employing a number of bioinformatics tools ( Table 2 ). The top 10 epitopes from each protein was further assessed by investigating the toxicity profile and allergenicity pattern. Different servers rely on different parameters to predict the allergenic nature of small peptides. Therefore, we used 4 distinct servers for such assessment and the epitopes predicted as non-allergen at least via 3 servers were retained for further analysis (Supplementary Table 5 ). Vaccine initiates the generation of effective antibodies that are usually produced by B cells and plays effector functions by targeting specifically to a foreign particles (Cooper & Nemerow, 1984) . The potential B cell epitopes were generated by three different algorithms (Bepipred linear epitope prediction 2.0, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity prediction and Emini surface accessibility prediction) from IEDB database (Table 3) .",

As PADRE sequence was usually recommended to lessen the polymorphism of HLA molecules in the population (Ghaffari-Nazari et al., 2015) , it was also considered to construct the final vaccine molecule. Here, adjuvants would enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine constructs and appropriate separation of epitopes in the host environment would be ensured by the linker (Yang et al., 2015) . Allergenicity, physiochemical properties, antigenicity and three-dimensional structure of vaccine constructs were characterized, and it had been concluded that V3 was superior to V1 and V2 vaccine constr. The final construct also occupied by several interferon-\u03b1 producing epitopes (Supplementary Table 8 ). The vaccine protein (V3) was subjected to disulfide engineering to enhance its stability. Analysis of the normal modes in internal coordinates by iMODS was employed to investigate the collective motion of vaccine molecules (Lopez-Blanco et al., 2014) . Negligible chance of deformability at molecular level was analyzed for the putative vaccine construct V3, thereby strengthening our prediction. Moreover, molecular docking was investigated to analyze the molecular affinity of the vaccine with different HLA molecules i.e. DRB1*0101, DRB5*0101, DRB3*0202, DRB1*0401, DRB3*0101 and DRB1*0301 (Table 5) . It had been reported that a specific receptor-binding domain of CoV spike protein usually recognizes its host receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) (Li. et al., 2003; Li, 2015) . Previous studies also identified dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as a functional receptor for human coronavirus (Raj et al., 2013) . Therefore, we performed another docking study prioritizing these immune receptors to strengthen our prediction ( Figure 11 ).",

COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2 formed clade with SARS-COV-1 and bat betacoronaviruses(Figure 2), which is consistent with the previous finding(Ceraolo & Giorgi, 2020).

While, the length of the gamma coronavirus candidate in our study, which utilizes turkey as host is 99 amino acids. The average length of the COVID-19 envelope proteins is 75 amino acid long. The NS3/E protein domains spans the whole length of the protein and possess mainly one transmembrane domain, one non-cytoplasmic domain and a cytoplasmic domain. However, some species from the sub-genera of Embecovirus shows two transmembrane domains (Figure 4, Supplementary File 1 and 2). While in our in-silico study, we found 2 transmembrane domains in SARS-CoV-1 and 2-3 transmembrane domains in MERS virus, previous experiments proved that both contains only one \u03b1 -helical transmembrane domains (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011; Surya et al., 2015). Though the computational analysis of CoVID-19 envelope protein secondary structure shows 2 transmembrane domains, our domain analysis shows only one such domain in their structures. Again, the Turkey corona virus also possess the same transmembrane, non-cytoplasmic domain and cytoplasmic domain, with a variation in the orientation.

The next two domains belong to the M matrix/glycoprotein domain family. The membrane proteins of coronaviruses ranges from 221 to 230 amino acid long. Computational analysis of secondary structures shows some variations of COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS virus (Supplementary File 3).

Again, both SARS-CoV-1 and MARS contain parallel beta sheets, while it is completely absent in the novel corona virus (Supplementary File 3).
