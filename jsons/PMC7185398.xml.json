            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral agent of acute respiratory infections in infants, young children and immunocompromised and elderly individuals [1], [2]. RSV can be rapidly transmitted within childcare institutions [3]. Infection with RSV can result in mild to severe illness, including lower respiratory syndromes such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. It has been estimated that nearly all two-year-old children have been infected [4]. The attachment G glycoprotein (G protein), a type II glycoprotein, is the most variable region both within and between the major RSV genotypes [5]. The G protein contains 2 hypervariable regions (HVR), with the second HVR (HVR2), located at the C-terminal end, which is widely used to study the genetic diversity of RSV [6], [7]. To date, 13 RSV-A genotypes, GA1-GA7 [8], [9], SAA1 [10], NA1-NA4 [11], [12], and ON1 [13], and 22 RSV-B genotypes, GB1-GB4 [8], BA1-BA6 [14], BA7-BA10 [15], SAB1-SAB3 [10], SAB4[16], URU1-URU2 [17], CB1, and BA-C [12] have been identified based on sequence analyses of HVR2. The frequent appearance of new genotypes may facilitate RSV evasion of existing herd immunity, further influencing disease severity, causing repeated infections and even larger outbreaks [11], [18].",

Our study shows a significant difference found in fever rates between mono-infected and co-infected groups of RSV-positive patients, while there was no difference found in fever rates reported by Zhang et al., [31].

It is interesting to point out that ON1 genotype strains appear to have emerged during the same period. The precise geographic distribution of ON1 genotype still awaits further elucidation. By early 2013, ON1 strains had spread so efficiently that they had nearly replaced other RSV-A strains in Italy [35]. In Hangzhou, we have only collected the samples from January to March in 2013. Among the 38 RSV positive strains, there were only 6 RSV-A strains, among them, 5 were successfully sequenced and all belonged to the ON1 genotype.

Similar patterns were observed in Kilifi, Kenya[39], the 27 novel Kilifi RSV genomes (11 RSVA and 16 RSVB) were used to assess local versus global RSV variety. Kilifi RSV strains are similar to strains that circulate in other regions of the world and reveal only limited local evolution. Phylogenetic clustering appeared to be more influenced by time of virus sample collection than by geographical location. Also, Agoti CN et al. [39] indicated that RSVB variants may spread less efficiently, with a higher variation, which is specific for local. Our study clarified this phenomenon, it may have strong consequences on the efficacy of any RSV vaccine used locally.",

These results demonstrate that subgroup B viruses display more mechanisms of variation in the G gene than subgroup A viruses. Similar amino acid homologies were also observed by Zhang and colleagues [31]. The variation was greatest among the four CB1 strains where three different lengths of the protein G were found (80aa, 83aa and 86aa). This prompts further RSV monitoring, particularly of CB1 genotype.",
