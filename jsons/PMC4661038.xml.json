            "text": "Mammalian defensins are cationic, tridisulfide\u2010containing peptides comprising 3 subfamilies denoted as \u03b1\u2010defensin, \u03b2\u2010defensin, and \u03b8\u2010defensin. Defensins contribute to host defense as antimicrobial agents [1, 2, 3, 4, 5\u20136] and by regulating inflammatory [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\u201313] and adaptive immune responses [14, 15, 16\u201317]. \u03b1\u2010Defensin and \u03b2\u2010defensin have similar 3\u2010dimensional topologies but differ in their disulfide linkages [18]. \u03b8\u2010Defensins are macrocyclic peptides expressed in Old World monkeys (e.g., macaques and baboons) and are the only known cyclic proteins in animals [19]. The \u03b8\u2010defensin backbone is produced by head\u2010to\u2010tail splicing of 2 nonapeptides excised from \u03b1\u2010defensin\u2010like precursors [20]. In rhesus macaques, alternate binary splicing of nonapeptides encoded by 3 precursor genes gives rise to 6 \u03b8\u2010defensin isoforms, RTD\u20101 to RTD\u20106 [20, 21]. In baboons, alternate nonapeptide splicing produces 10 \u03b8\u2010defensin isoforms [22]. \u03b8\u2010Defensins are expressed at high levels in granules of neutrophils and in monocytes [20], and RTD\u20101 is the most abundant \u03b8\u2010defensin in macaques, constituting \u223c55% of the total \u03b8\u2010defensin content of rhesus neutrophils [23]. \u03b8\u2010Defensins have a major role in the antimicrobial activities of rhesus neutrophil\u2010granule extracts [23]. Humans and other hominids lack \u03b8\u2010defensins because of a stop codon in the prepro\u2010coding sequence of \u03b8\u2010defensin genes in these species [24]. It has been suggested that the expression of \u03b8\u2010defensins in Old World monkeys underlies differences in immune and inflammatory responses of these nonhuman primates from those of humans [19].",

For example, some \u03b1\u2010defensins and \u03b2\u2010defensins are chemotactic for T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and monocytes [14, 15, 16\u201317], and they induce secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from activated dendritic cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and epithelial cells [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\u201313]. In contrast to these proinflammatory activities, we recently reported that \u03b8\u2010defensins have anti\u2010inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. RTD\u20101 was a potent inhibitor of cytokine secretion by human peripheral blood leukocytes stimulated with diverse TLR agonists [26]. Naturally occurring \u03b8\u2010defensin isoforms (RTDs 1\u20136) [23] possess variable potency in suppressing TNF expression by LPS\u2010stimulated or Escherichia coli\u2010stimulated leukocytes. RTD\u20101 suppressed inflammatory cytokines, including TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and several chemokines in mouse models of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus infection [27], E. coli peritonitis, and in polymicrobial sepsis [26], and these effects strongly correlated with reduced mortality in each model. These results suggest that \u03b8\u2010defensins modulate inflammation via regulation of pathways shared by diverse inflammatory stimuli. To identify regulatory pathways mediated by these novel macrocyclic peptides, we analyzed the effects of RTD\u20101 on stimulated THP\u20101 macrophages and human monocytes, evaluating effects of the peptide on cytokine expression and secretion and on signal transduction pathways involved in the inflammatory response.",

Consistent with these findings, 10 \u00b5g/ml RTD\u20101, a concentration that we previously found was very effective in blocking TNF secretion from stimulated blood cells, was highly effective in blocking secretion of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20108 by LPS\u2010stimulated THP\u20101 cells and in human monocytes (Fig. 1). Because RTD\u20101 binds inefficiently to LPS, its immune regulatory effects are not mediated by neutralization of LPS [26].

RTD\u20101 treatment markedly inhibited NF\u2010\u03baB activation by each agonist (Fig. 3) and the inhibitory effect was dose dependent. Consistent with these findings, RTD\u20101 inhibited translocation of NF\u2010\u03baB p65 to the nucleus in LPS\u2010stimulated macrophages (Fig. 4) and stabilized I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig. 6).

PI3K\u2010Akt is a known negative regulator of NF\u2010\u03baB and MAPK pathways and inhibits TNF\u2010\u03b1 gene expression in LPS\u2010stimulated cells [31, 47, 48]. Consistent with this, resveratrol inhibits secretion of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u03b2 in LPS\u2010stimulated RAW264.7 cells by stimulating the PI3K\u2010Akt pathway, which is accompanied by inhibition of p38 and JNK MAPK [49]. Inhibition of the PI3K\u2010Akt pathway increases the mortality and circulating proinflammatory cytokine levels in endotoxemic mice [50], as well as in mice with polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture [51]. Additionally, glucan phosphate, which protects mice in the cecal ligation and puncture model, increased tissue PI3K activity in kidney, lung, and heart, correlating with survival of these animals [51]. Interestingly, both human \u03b1\u2010defensin HNP1 and human \u03b2\u2010defensins HBD2 and HBD3 stimulate expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from human conjunctival epithelial cells, which are accompanied by phosphorylation of Akt [12]. Both \u03b1\u2010defensins and \u03b2\u2010defensins are known to regulate cellular responses through receptor\u2010mediated pathways; human neutrophil peptides induce signaling pathways through the P2Y6 receptor [7]. The human \u03b2\u2010defensins HBD2 and HBD3 induce chemotaxis in monocytes through the CCR2 receptor [52], and HBD2 induces chemotaxis in dendritic and T cells through the CCR6 receptors [15]. To date, there have been no reports of a receptor for \u03b8\u2010defensins. Nevertheless, studies are underway to identify RTD\u20101 targets upstream of the PI3K\u2010Akt pathway and the relationship of RTD\u20101\u2010induced pAkt to downstream signaling pathways. The suppression of TNF\u2010\u03b1 secretion by RTD\u20101 is extremely rapid, suggesting that RTD\u20101 may also regulate pathways distinct from those involved in signaling and expression of proinflammatory genes [26].",

It has been suggested that the contrasting proinflammatory and anti\u2010inflammatory properties reported for \u03b2\u2010defensins may reflect differences in structural features and/or in the purity of the peptide preparations [53]. Another possibility, as suggested by others, is that the proinflammatory vs. anti\u2010inflammatory properties of a single peptide may be a function of local concentration [55, 56\u201357]. In this context, we speculate the \u03b8\u2010defensins, expressed at very high levels in granules of circulating neutrophils and monocytes [23], provide a physiologic dampening of inflammatory processes following their release and/or secretion systemically or locally.",
