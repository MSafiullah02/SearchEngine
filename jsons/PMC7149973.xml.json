An ultimate goal for virologists and structural biologists alike is antiviral targeting of pertinent RNA helicases. A daunting task because retroviral RNA biology is intertwined with nuclear RNA helicases at every step, genetic, biophysical, and structural studies have defined RNA helicases important to early and late steps in HIV replication. The deepening knowledge of RNA helicase ancillary domains and cognate viral nucleotide\u2013nucleotide pairings subject to helicase unwinding is critical information to eventually segregate retroviral RNP targets from cellular RNPs necessary to cell viability. The following sections trace the steps in retroviral replication in context of cell biology and prospective antiviral activity of select RNA helicases (Table 7.3\n).",

These observations have been attributed to aberrant reverse transcription of the incoming genomic RNA in an unseemly relationship to the posttranscriptional life of primary retroviral transcripts.

Downregulation of DHX9 by siRNA in producer cells did not affect viral genomic RNA dimerization or packaging, but those virions were poorly infectious, as determined by activation of a galactosidase indicator (MAGI) in Hela-T4 cells (Roy et al., 2006). Similar virion infectivity loss was also observed by infection of primary cells (Bolinger et al., 2010). The tRNALys3\u2013viral RNA complexes extracted from DHX9-deficient virions were less efficient in base extension in a primer extension assay (Roy et al., 2006, Xing et al., 2011). In addition to reverse transcription initiation, the strand transfer step was also impaired in the absence of DHX9 (Roy et al., 2006). Importantly, a gain-of-function experiment demonstrated that exogenously expressed DHX9 packaged into HIV-1 virions rescues reverse transcription initiation when the endogenous DHX9 has been silenced (Xing et al., 2012).",

            "text": "DHX9 associates with HIV-1 Gag and is recruited into virus particles in an RNA-dependent manner (Roy et al., 2006). In 2012, the observed stoichiometry of DHX9 in virions was determined proportional to the genomic RNA, n = 2 (Sharma and Boris-Lawrie, 2012). Recently, isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed that the dimeric HIV-1 5\u2032UTR conformation binds one DHX9 molecule per RNA strand, in a manner independent of binding to the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra using a deuterium-labeling approach resolved the structure of the dimeric 5\u2032UTR in complex with the N-terminal dsRBDs of DHX9. The structure of the large molecular mass complex was found to be dependent on DHX9 binding to a double-stranded region of the primer-binding site (PBS) segment of the 5\u2032UTR. These results are consistent with measurement of DHX9-depleted virus particles of reduced level of tRNALys3 that annealed onto the PBS (Roy et al., 2006). In the viral RNA, a single A-to-C substitution was sufficient to disrupt the conformation of the PBS segment and attenuate virion infectivity in cells. Therefore, the contribution of DHX9 to virion infectivity is attributable to its structure-dependent binding at the PBS segment of the HIV 5\u2032UTR during virus assembly (Boeras et al., 2016), consistent with prior data positing DHX9 fosters conformations favoring the action of viral reverse transcriptase (Xing et al., 2011).",

Once integrated, nuclear RH associates with provirus, supporting transcription and viral RNA processing, export, translation, dimerization, and genomic RNP assembly. The intimate association between the provirus and cellular RNPs mimics that of a cellular gene, and conceivably those nuclear marks shield viral genomes in newly infected cells from recognition by DHX58/RIGi and other innate sensors that detect cytoplasmic viral replication intermediates and trigger interferon response.",

MOV10 is associated with Gag nucleocapsid RNA\u2013binding domain and is detectable in HIV virions (Abudu et al., 2012), but its activity is controversial. Biochemically, MOV10 interacts with Rev in an RNA-independent manner, and Rev/Rev response element\u2013dependent nuclear export was reduced by dominant-negative helicase mutant (Fig. 7.1). Exogenous expression of MOV10 diminishes production of virions and those virions exhibit deficient HIV reverse transcription and poor infectivity, positing MOV10 as an antiviral factor (Goodier et al., 2012). In unresolved controversy, independent research identified siRNA downregulation of endogenous MOV10 did not change virion production and considered endogenous MOV10 acts as cofactor (Arjan-Odedra et al., 2012). In aggregate, modulation of MOV10 incurs an imbalance in HIV RNP activity, consistent with indirect and possibly beneficial effect on biogenesis of infectious HIV (Huang et al., 2015).",

The dhx9 gene lays in the 1q25 tumor susceptibility locus associated with neoplasms of prostate, lung, and breast. Roles for DHX9 in tumor biology involve dysregulation of DNA damage response related to gene expression and DNA genotoxic stress. A nucleocytoplasmic shuttling DEIH helicase, DHX9 bridges chromatin-bound transcription coactivator proteins (e.g., EP300/CBP) to RNA polymerase II (Table 7.2). The tethering requires DHX9\u2019s N-terminus and flanking residues of a minimal transactivation domain (Aratani et al., 2001, Nakajima et al., 1997). By connecting coactivators with RNA polymerase II through a DHX9 bridge, this RNA helicase activates transcription of specific genes. Susceptible coactivators, in addition to CBP, include NFkB p65, BRCA1 breast cancer\u2013specific tumor suppressor BRCA1, the Zic2 protein, EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein, p16INK4a tumor suppressor and multidrug resistance 1 protein (MDR1).",

Because of limited P-TEFb, RNA polymerase II stalling of HIV transcription complex occurs within the R region of the HIV long terminal repeat yielding truncated transcripts of \u223c100 nucleotides that are identified as Tat transactivation responsive element, TAR (Table 7.2). Tat/TAR interaction facilitates 5\u2032end capping of nascent RNA necessary to recruitment of nuclear cap\u2013binding proteins CBP80/CBP20 (Zhou et al., 2003). In the absence of Tat, DHX9 exhibits biochemical affinity for TAR, an observation that may explain DHX9 overexpression activates transcription of HIV TAR-luc reporter RNA (Fujii et al., 2001). Overexpression of DHX9 is posited to tip 7SK-P-TEFb equilibrium toward dissociation of P-TEFb, ultimately facilitating Tat/TAR transactivation of HIV. Released from 7SK RNP, P-TEFb stimulates HIV Tat/TAR-dependent transcriptional elongation through a mechanism that involves both phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and by interfering with the activity of negative elongation factors (Table 7.3). Speculation is DHX9 loading to TAR during basal transcription modulates 5\u2032UTR RNA conformation and the retention of CBP80 in later stages of HIV expression (see below).",

A component of the exon junction complex that binds nascent RNA, UPF1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm using the CRM1 pathway, and activates RNA surveillance at exon\u2013exon junctions through a series of phosphorylation events during pioneer-round translation. In association with nuclear cap-binding proteins CBP80/CBP20, UPF1 is a sentinel in the process of NMD. NMD parses nonsense-free mRNAs from nonsense-containing transcripts that have potential to translate polypeptide deleterious to the cell. UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3 activate cotranslational RNA decay when scanning ribosome encounter a stop codon that is aberrantly positioned within an open reading frame. However, UPF1 bound to retrovirus unspliced RNAs is responsible for alternative activity: subverting NMD at the premature stop codon laying within the polymerase open reading frame of unspliced transcripts (Fig. 7.1).",

Reconciling the beneficial activity of shuttling RNA helicases to retroviruses with the antiviral activity of cytosolic helicases that oppose other RNA viruses remains to be fully understood. From the vantage point of a retrovirus, RNA helicases are cofactors required to transcribe provirus DNA, stimulate transcriptional elongation and RNA processing, and facilitate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of retroviral RNPs to become translated. From the vantage point of a cell, RNA helicases are antiviral sensors, detecting non\u2013self-RNA in the cytoplasm and triggering an antiviral state. However, retroviruses circumvent these cellular RNA sensors, instead co-opting nuclear RNA helicases and using them in a manner analogous to cellular transcripts, dissipating the restrictive activity of RNA helicases that actively thwarts cytoplasmic replication of many other RNA viruses.\n",
