More than 200 000 laboratory confirmed cases and nearly 10 000 deaths in over 100 countries have been reported to date [2] , leading the World Health Organization in March 11, 2020 to characterize the infection, subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , as a pandemic [3] . The spectrum of symptomatic COVID-19 ranges from mild respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction [4] . It is well established that fever along with respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnoea represent the common symptoms of COVID-19 similar to the diseases caused by the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 [5] . There is uncertainty about extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, including those affecting the liver and gastrointestinal tract. This review aims to provide insight into characteristics, possible mechanisms and implications of hepatic and gastrointestinal involvement caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, adding to our knowledge of the spectrum of COVID-19.",

SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter its target cells [20] . Data from two independent cohorts revealed significant enrichment of ACE2 expression in cholangiocytes (59.7% of cells) compared to hepatocytes (2.6% of cells) suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might directly bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function [21] . Although ACE2 is highly expressed in bile duct cells, recent works suggest that gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) was elevated in 54% of COVID-19 patients, whereas only 1.8% of patients (1/56) had elevated alkaline phosphatase level [22] . Elsewhere, pathological analysis of hepatic tissue from a patient who died from COVID-19 did not find viral inclusions in the liver [23] .",

Previous studies have shown that inflammatory cytokine storm is associated with adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV [24] or MERS-CoV infection [25] . Inflammatory cytokine storm is an overactive inflammatory response, which leads to persistent activation of lymphocytes and macrophages that secrete huge amount of inflammatory cytokines [26] . Lymphocytes are important for inhibiting overactive innate immune responses during viral infection [27] . Thus, the typical lymphopenia during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-c levels and aggravated inflammatory responses, leading not only to pulmonary injury, but also the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver [28] . A study of the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, found that lymphopenia and CRP level were independently associated with liver injury, suggesting that inflammatory cytokine storm might be the major mechanism [29] .",

SARS patients with HBV/HCV infection were more prone to develop severe hepatitis, probably due to enhanced viral replication during SARS-CoV infection [33] . Individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 are typically of older age and/or present with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, a similar profile to those at increased risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, making them more susceptible to liver injury. In patients with COVID-19 with autoimmune hepatitis, the effects of administration of glucocorticoids on disease prognosis is unclear.

Firstly, interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 might result in diarrhoea. A recent bioinformatics analysis revealed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in alveolar type II (AT2) cells in the lung, but also in the glandular cells of gastric and duodenal epithelia [44] . Similar findings were found in the study by Liang et al. [45] , ACE2 was highly expressed in proximal and distal enterocytes, directly exposed to food and foreign pathogens. The ACE2-expressing enterocytes are invaded by SARS-CoV-2, leading to malabsorption, unbalanced intestinal secretion and activated enteric nervous system, resulting in diarrhoea finally [44] . Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 indirectly damages the digestive system through a chain of inflammatory responses [42] . Another possible factor causing diarrhoea in COVID-19 patients might be antibiotic associated diarrhea [43] . Finally, changes in the composition and function of digestive tract flora mutually affect the respiratory tract through immune regulation, the so-called ''gut-lung axis\" [46] .",

Considering the evidence of faecal excretion for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [49] , it is possible that the digestive system may serve as an alternative route of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been reported that the stool from confirmed cases tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 [39] . In terms of the fact that most of the patients in the initial outbreak reported a link to a wild animal market, this observation raises questions about whether this virus was transmitted via contaminated food at the small intestine [45] . Another issue of potential significance, is the extended duration of viral shedding in faeces. In one study, it was observed that for over half of patients, faecal samples remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a mean of 11.2 days after viral clearance in respiratory tract samples [50] . According to current guidance, the decision to discharge hospitalized COVID-19 patients is based on negative results of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two sequential respiratory tract specimens collected !24 h apart [51] . Therefore, routine stool sample testing with RT-PCR could be added and transmission-based precautions should be continued if faecal samples test positive [50] .",

Patients with COVID-19 and cancer had a higher risk of severe events [53] . Likewise, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using biologics and immunosuppressive agents are at increased risk for more frequent and severe infections and could be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [48] . Fortunately, with early precautions for COVID-19 prevention and control, not a single patient of the 318 patients (204 with ulcerative colitis and 114 with Crohn's disease) in the IBD registry in Wuhan, has been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 [54] . These precautions included recommendations on the use of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, diet, and intentional postponement of elective surgery and endoscopy, as well as personal protection provisions [55] .

Risk assessment and stratification of patients prior to any endoscopic procedure: A high index of suspicion to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection, is crucial for prevention of transmission. Screening of patients for COVID-19 should be based on case definitions established by WHO and local health authorities [63] . The assessment must include history of fever, respiratory symptoms, or diarrhea, history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 and any recent travel to a high-risk area [61] . 3. Negative-pressure room: Whenever possible, endoscopy should be performed in an isolated room with negative pressure. If not available, endoscopy should be performed in a dedicated room with adequate ventilation [64] . 4. Staff protection: The minimal composition of personal protective equipment (PPE) for personnel in endoscopy units should include gloves, hairnet, protective eyewear (goggles or face shield), waterproof gowns, and respiratory protective equipment, modified on the basis of risk stratification [61] . The surgical facial mask is effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets, whereas, filtering facepiece (FFP) respirator class 2 or 3 (FFP2/FFP3) achieves efficient filtration of airborne particles (up to 0.3 mm) [65] . In addition to PPE, health care workers must be educated the principles of contact and airborne precautions for both suspect and probable COVID-19 patients [64] .",
