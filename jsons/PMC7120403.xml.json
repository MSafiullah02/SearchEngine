With rich per capita availability of natural resources, wealth metrics thrive to embark Saudi Arabia upon economic diversification and long-term strategic economic objectives requiring large number of externally sourced labour\u2014both highly skilled and low skilled (Khraif 2009a, b; Ali 1986). This has increased the number of expatriates, despite the increasing attention to native human resource development (UNDP 2004; Khraif 2000). Labour force in the Kingdom experiences structural changes, with service sector taking the lead in replacing the agricultural sector which perpetuated the heavy need for foreign labour (Khraif 2000; Sufian 1993; United Nations 1990). Expatriate labour force, with their sincere involvement in daily responsibilities, created a total reliance even in private space\u2014direct impact of non-nationals on the lives of citizens (Forstenlechner and Rutledge 2011).",

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has the largest land area and population among the GCC members, where expatriates form 25.9 per cent of the total population (Center for Population Studies 2012). That is, one in every four persons in the Kingdom is an expatriate, indirectly influencing fertility decisions (Khraif 2009a, b; Courbage 1995). The expert and technical labour force brought in to fulfil the increasing requirements of technological development and innovation affects the locally available native manpower in the fast changing Saudi Arabia, resulting in an imbalance on regional and urban scales, impacting upon economy, urban planning, transport, housing and employment and, in return, creating an over-urbanization (United Nations 2009, 2006; Khraif 2007, 2001; Makki 1986). Still, from the role played by migrants in the economy, provisions of government services and social contracts, citizens benefit from their unregulated cheap employment at domestic level (Forstenlechner and Rutledge 2011).",

However, as compared with the other GCC countries\u2014Bahrain, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE)\u2014the effect of migration on population growth is found lesser in the Kingdom, despite the push to develop infrastructure\u2014power stations, government ministries and industries (Khraif 2000). Perhaps, the Saudization policies that changed labour and immigration laws since 2000 have influenced this trend. On the other hand, it is a fact that liberalization and globalization attract professional or skilled labour force from East Asia and Africa to Western countries. With the changing labour visa regulations, a decline in immigration in the Kingdom is expected in the future, which will create a population structure and distribution conducive for enabling an equitable treatment, policies and programmes. To achieve a positive relation between population dynamics and socioeconomic development, planning for migration at all levels should be associated with decentralization of decision-making in large urban centres and distribution of economic investment over a wide area, where urban population spreads out in medium and small centres (Makki 1986).",

That is, the immigrants have started returning to their native countries more often (Fig. 5.3). In contrast, the national censuses show a continuously increasing immigrant population in the Kingdom but with lower growth rates, during 2004\u20132010, as compared to 1992\u20132004. In short, the migration data (net migrants) as given by the US Census Bureau do not tally with the national datasets. A similar trend is visibly noted in all the other GCC states but at different periods. Oman started experiencing negative net migration since 2003. Similarly, Qatar has the highest rate of net migration, followed by Bahrain. Definitely, these countries will soon follow the trends of Saudi Arabia, as the labour laws of Saudi Arabia are usually adopted by the other GCC states. These data also require comparisons with the national censuses for understanding the trend of immigration.\n",

There exits tremendous and varying degrees of pull and push factors determined by socioeconomic development, industrialization and urbanization. The major in-migrating areas are Tabouk, Al-Riyadh and Eastern region, while the major out-migrating destinations are Al-Baha, Jazan, Hail, Al-Qaseem, Aseer and Northern Borders. A few areas remain more or less stable without pulling or pushing native population. Public sector employment and proximity to metropolis (Riyadh, Jeddah/Makkah or Dammam) are major pull factors. Makkah Al-Mokarramah maintains the status without being influenced significantly by the migration flows. Again, as seen elsewhere, males migrate more than females, as observed in the absolute numbers of in-migrants and out-migrants as well as net migrants. The regional development\u2014infrastructure development and promoting medium-sized cities\u2014with an aim to create employment encourages native population to continue living at their own birth places. Those areas experiencing substantial levels of immigration require redistribution policies, both for population and infrastructure development programmes. The spatial mobility may be regulated by encouraging local-level human resource development and regional development efforts underway in the Kingdom such as the creation of industrial, educational and medical townships at various geographic destinations.",
