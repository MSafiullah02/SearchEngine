As a consequence of improved emergency medical treatment, early death rates (48 h post injury) have been significantly reduced. However, death rates resulting from trauma-related complications have not diminished. The most common and dangerous complication that can develop post surgery/trauma is infection caused by opportunistic pathogens, which pose a significant challenge to the healing process [1] . In addition to interference with the healing process and direct damage to infected tissues caused by the infecting organism, systemic complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and acute renal failure (ARF) can develop. These complications significantly exacerbate a patient's already deteriorating health and increase recovery times that correlate directly with increased mortality. Therefore, these infections are a major threat to trauma patients, early detection and control of respective infectious agents is essential in decreasing the rates of post trauma-associated morbidity and mortality.",

            "text": "Community acquired infections often occur at the injury site and, despite the use of preventative measures (including antibiotics), the significant incidence and severity of post-traumatic infections needs to be addressed. Improvements to support therapies facilitating the survival of severe trauma patients are threatened by emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens, making treatment of post-traumatic infections challenging, especially since even the best treatment options are not guaranteed to prevent infections. Wound infections. Most primary wound suture infections are caused by S. aureus. Farming accidents and other outdoor traumas often include inoculation of wounds with Gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa. The identification of the causative agent of industrial accident or mechanized farming trauma-related wounds is very important since atypical bacteria may be present on the equipment associated with these accidents. Suppurative infections caused by insect stings are primarily caused by S. aureus, therefore, if a Gram-positive cocci is identified, the likely cause of the infection can be deduced without additional microbiological testing. Bacterial infections. Bacterial infections can develop into necrotizing fasciitis that can be caused by group A Streptococcus, aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. Necroinflammation may develop relatively slowly in infections caused by multiple organisms. Various gram-negative enteropathogens that are typically obligate anaerobes are associated with infections resulting from intestinal puncture wounds, and S. aureus infections can also result from these types of trauma. Group A Streptococcus and S. aureus are also associated with toxic shock syndrome resulting from hemodynamic instability and soft tissue necrosis. In addition, deep wound infections can be caused by gangrenous anaerobic spore-forming bacteria, and drainage of respective wounds is typically associated with short gram-positive bacteria. Open fractures. Soft tissue infections (STI) are frequently associated with open fractures, and infections are typically caused by S. aureus infections. However, nosocomial infections occur more frequently than infections caused by environmental wound infections. Intra-abdominal infections. Bacteria associated with peritonitis resulting from intestinal trauma are typically of intestinal origin. However, celiac cultures may not be an effective means of identifying microbial species during emergency laparotomies, and the nature of the respective pathogens is consistent with the region of the intestine damaged. Therefore, the accuracy of hypothesizing, as to the nature of the causative agent responsible for respective infections resulting from bacteria of intestinal origin, is limited to the experience of the physician. The types of bacteria, which can cause infections presenting an abdominal abscess, are highly variable, further supporting the observations that damage to different regions of the intestine can result in vastly different types of infections. For example, patients suffering from a ruptured colon can become infected with intestinal gram-negative bacteria and/or anaerobic bacteria. Abscesses caused by S. aureus, Pseudomonas species and other nosocomial, drug-resistant bacteria can often occur in patients with abdominal drainage tubes. The most common pathogen-associated pleural cavity trauma-related infections are S. aureus related and these infections typically result from bacterial colonization of abrasions present on the patient's skin or contamination of indwelling devices. Contamination of indwelling devices with Gram-negative organisms should be considered, if pyothorax infections are secondary to sub-diaphragm infections.",

            "text": "Most patients suffering from traumatic injuries receive timely treatment in hospitals, including antibiotic prophylaxis and wound debridement. Therefore, any resulting infections are nosocomial, typically occur superficially and are generally easy to manage. Most infections of this nature develop within 48 h in hospital and are the most common type of infection observed in burn and trauma patients. Unfortunately, the rates of nosocomial infections continue to rise, in part due to the development of more invasive (and frequent) therapies, the misuse of antibiotics and iatrogenic contamination. Currently, nosocomial infections have seriously affected the quality of medical treatment, resulting in significant economic losses and wasted resources [2] . Although most burn and trauma patients are relatively young, the incidence of nosocomial infections is highest in this population since these types of injuries predispose patients to infections for the following reasons: loss of skin due to burns leaves an unprotected area vulnerable to infection by numerous pathogens, damage to the intestine can expose the body to flora not typically present in extra-intestinal tissues; treatment involves the use of indwelling devices that also provide a conduit for infectious pathogens; the use of conventional antibiotic prophylaxis may not prevent infections with virulent antibiotic resistant antibiotics and massive bleeding and serious damage may affect the host immunity. Respiratory and urinary tract infections are the most common sites of post-traumatic nosocomial infections, compared to wound (incision infections), blood, chest and abdominal infections, which are rarer. Nosocomial infections of burn and trauma patients can be caused by various pathogens, including gram-negative organisms such as P. aeruginosa, E. coli, enterbacteriaceae, crayresearch bacteria and gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci. In addition, fungal infections caused by Candida albicans and other yeasts are also common. The rate of drug-resistant nosocomial infections is 91.6% and the rate of MSRA infections in burn and trauma patients was higher than in other in-hospital patient populations. Although nosocomial infections from different geographic locations vary in the context of the organisms most frequently identified, the group of pathogens associated with these infections remains constant worldwide.",

UTI infections in this group occurred at a reduced frequency (from 76.8% to 35%). Severe injuries (ISS 19) presented with even higher incidence rates of respiratory infections ranging from 51.9% to 41.7% and blood and UTI infections remained at 8% and 2.6%, respectively. In summary, mild injuries are associated with UTIs and moderate and severe injuries with respiratory and blood infections. It has been reported that blood infection rates in patients with serious wounds reached as high as 19%. Blood infections commonly were reported to occur 1-week post injury. In addition, since trauma patients often present multiple wounds, it is common for more than one site to become infected. Studies have shown that 58% of post-traumatic nosocomial infections may involve two or more sites, while single site infections accounted for only 42% of infections.",

Both S. aureus and S. epidermidis have acquired multiple antibiotic-resistance genes including methicillin resistance i.e. methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE). In addition, S. aureus has acquired the ACME element from S. epidermidis that facilitates the intracellular survival of S. aureus.

Enterococcus species are part of the normal intestinal flora of both humans and other mammals, and the prevalence of infections from these organisms are only second to S. aureus infections. In addition, Enterococcal infections are common causes of UTI and sepsis cases post surgery. Treatment complications are associated primarily with enterococcal strains that are resistant to a broad range of antibiotics. Streptococcus. Streptococcus genera include 40 subtypes and these organisms are a part of the normal oral cavity and gastrointestinal flora. Not surprisingly, infections with these organisms are common agents of post-surgical or post-trauma infections. Group A streptococci are some of the more virulent streptococci, in part due to their ability to produce numerous enzymes and exotoxins, including the M protein, hyaluronidase, streptokinase, streptodornase, streptococcal hemolysin and pyrogenic exotoxin.

Pseudomonas. Pseudomonas sp. is widely distributed in nature and comprises more than 200 species, some of which comprise members of normal human flora. Depressed immune responses associated with post surgical procedures and trauma, in addition to invasive treatment protocols (i.e. tracheotomies and the use of indwelling devices) lead to Pseudomonas sp. infections, making infections with this pathogen important to consider in the context of nosocomial infections. P. aeruginosa infections are the fourth leading cause of Gram-negative sepsis, and the leading cause of sepsis-related deaths. In addition, exposure to Pseudomonas sp. can easily progress into respiratory infections, infective endocarditis, UTI, central nervous system infections, digestive tract infections, joint infections and skin and soft tissue infections. Escherichia. Escherichia sp. infections are primarily caused by different E. coli strains even though many non-pathogenic E. coli strains comprise a significant percentage of the healthy intestinal flora. Pathogenic E. coli have been divided into five primary categories: enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). The most common infection route associated with these E. coli strains results from parenteral infections that are present as UTI and acute diarrhea. These types of E. coli infections are common post surgery and trauma. Klebsiella. Klebsiella sp. is a Gram-negative bacilli comprising 7 strains that include K. pneumonia, the primary Klebsiella sp. associated with iatrogenic infections. K. pneumonia isolates have been demonstrated to produce extracellular toxic compounds (ETC, the primary [63%] capsular polysaccharide), lipid polysaccharide (30%) and small amounts of protein (7%). Some strains produce thermolabile (LT) and thermostable (ST) toxins and capsule formation is also related to pathogenicity. Serratia. Serratia sp. is small, gram-negative bacteria which can produce water-insoluble yellow, purple and red pigments. Serratia sp. has been discovered in soil, water, plants and in animal and human intestinal tract and urinary tract samples. S. marcescens is the main nosocomial-associated Serratia sp., and infections with this pathogen are associated with pneumonia, sepsis, blood transfusion infections and surgical, postoperative infections and UTI.",

Finally, Proteus infections are a primary cause of post-surgical and wound infections. Acinetobacter. This genus can be divided into 6 species that are also widely distributed in external environments such as water, soil, and other damp environments. Acinetobacter sp. comprises 25% of the normal human skin flora of humans in addition to 7% of bacteria recoverable from pharynx (7%) cultures. In addition, it has been found to colonize the conjunctiva, gastrointestinal tract and has been identified in both saliva and vaginal secretions. Due to their adherence properties, these organisms are difficult to remove from medical instruments and are a primary cause of post-surgical iatrogenic infections and trauma. Their prevalence in clinical settings is only second to that of P. aeruginosa. Enterobacter. Enterbacteriaceae in general comprise a group of pathogens that are widely distributed in nature and are members of the intestinal flora of both humans and other animals. E. aerogenes and E. cloacea are common causative agents of UTI and respiratory infections occurring post-surgery or trauma. Infections with these pathogens can progress to sepsis or meningitis.

Debridement not only prevents infections, but also creates an environment conducive to the repair and healing of deep tissues and in the restoration of function and structural integrity of the injured area. The process of debridement includes the removal of necrotic tissue, hematomas and/or foreign bodies while retaining viable tissues. The beneficial effects of debridement are more effectively observed if this process is carried out no later than 6 -8 h post injury, since bacteria during this time frame have not yet penetrated into deeper tissues of the contaminated wound. For smaller wounds resulting in less serious injuries contamination is less likely and less severe, particularly in cooler climates. Smaller wounds can be sutured 24 h post injury if they are correctly cleaned. For severely contaminated wounds, debridement is more difficult 24 h after injury and in warmer climates debridement must be carried out quickly to prevent pathogen dissemination. Studies have demonstrated that repeated debridement every 48 -72 h is important in the removal of necrotic tissues not removed following the initial debridement procedure. Full thickness wound resection, followed by a second resection, are the most effective debridement procedures. For some wounds, which may not have been completely resected all at once, should be repeatedly washed to remove all contaminants prior to continuing with the resection process. Open fracture wound closures should be carried out as soon as possible to reduce infection rates since avoiding dehydration of deep tissues will accelerate fracture healing.",

Primary sutures put in after debridement are important in protecting wounds from infection and environmental contaminants. However, for seriously contaminated wounds of soft tissues, or tissues where efficient debridement cannot be performed, primary sutures are not recommended and should not be put in until the wound can be better stabilized.

Antibiotics should be administered intravenously at a rate that ensures that the correct antibiotic concentration is achieved in blood and tissues. If necessary, antibiotics can be administered during surgical procedures and the antibiotics selected should be used short-term and not utilized post-surgery. Some researchers believe that a single dose of antibiotics can be used to treat purulent S. aureus infections when combined with debridement, irrigation and primary sutures. However, systemic antibiotic use is unnecessary following wound closure, particularly since antibiotic use at this juncture will result in microflora imbalances and will select antibiotic resistant organisms without reducing wound infection rates. Early use of antibiotics for the prevention of infections associated with open fractures, however, is well accepted. Studies have indicated that bacterial contamination of open fracture wounds likely occurs within the hospital environment and early use (3 -5 days) is recommended prior to treatment. Lee et al. reported that positive rates of bacterial cultures from fracture wounds were not high before debridement, are not predictive of infection nor did they reflect the species of bacteria that may be the causative agent of an infection (if it develops) [7] .

Therefore, proliferating microorganisms can spread rapidly at the fascia surface, sometimes resulting in fascia necrosis. Surgical contamination of hollow organs as a result of inappropriate antibiotic use and serious primary suture infections can often result in necrotizing fasciitis. Infections resulting in necrotizing faciitis are the result (in most cases) of mixed infections comprised of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria resulting in the production of fetid pus production. Rea and Wyrick confirmed the presence of gram-positive bacteria (including Streptococcus and S. aureus), gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria in necrotizing faciitis tissues. The most prominent clinical manifestations of disease are fascia necrosis, cellulitis, edema, skin discoloration and gas gangrene.

Clostridium muscular necrosis (gas gangrene): Clostridium muscular necrosis (gas gangrene) is a rapid developing, severe, acute infection caused by infections with Clostridium perfringens; a gram-positive, short and thick spore-forming anaerobic bacteria. This type of infection is common following severe trauma, especially in patients with open fractures, significantly contaminated muscle wounds and infections in tissues with poor blood circulation.

The incubation period of this infection is shorter, i.e. 3 or more days after injury is common. Wound pain is one of the first symptoms to present itself and is severe and difficult to control. Edema develops around the wound site and the skin becomes pale, shiny, rapidly turns purple and finally turns a dark gray, accompanied by the emergence of large and small blisters containing foul-smelling serous or blood liquid.

The nature of this flora has evolved with humans and serves various beneficial purposes at respective anatomic sites. The quantity of microorganisms comprising the human intestinal flora is larger than that in any other organ in the body and the number of bacteria (10 14 ) is 10 -20 times the number of human cells comprising the human body. Intestinal microflora form a biological intestinal barrier that protects the intestinal epithelium from colonization with pathogenic bacteria, participates in host metabolic processes and contributes nutritional value that promotes (host) growth and health. In 2001, Hooper et al. found that the major human intestinal bacteria formed part of the host biological and immune barriers that contribute to intestinal growth, symbiotic bacterial metabolism, nutrient absorption and angiogenesis. Therefore, the balance and health of the intestinal microflora is a sign of health. The functional integrity of the normal intestinal flora (and the intestinal barrier they provide) has an important role not only in preventing bacterial infections, but also in diminishing inflammation, ulcer formation and preventing allergic and neoplastic diseases. When the intestinal barrier function is impaired, intestinal bacterial translocation can occur. The currently accepted view is that bacterial translocation is the process by which microorganisms and their respective toxins cross the intestinal wall into otherwise sterile tissues, including the mesenteric lymph nodes, portal vein and other distant organs or systems, providing primary bacterial foci that contribute to various infections. Following surgery and trauma, the intestinal barrier function can be impaired due to shock, hypoxemia, malnutrition and reduced immune function which facilitate intestinal flora translocation leading to intestinal infections. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the intestinal barrier will help with the control of intestinal infections.",

            "text": "Gut absorption takes place on luminal surfaces and adjacent cells are connected by junctional complexes including tight junctions, gap junctions, adhesion junctions and desmosomes. Tight junctions are the most important type of cell-to-cell connection and can be of two types: (i) Villus epithelial tight junctions which have a smaller pore size and complex structure allowing only water molecules and other small molecules to selectively pass between cells; (ii) Duct cell tight junctions which have larger pore sizes and are simple in structure, allowing larger molecules to pass between cells. Tight junctions form a narrow band structure located outside of the top of the epithelial cell membrane. Adjacent cells form a fusion or match point, connected to form a continuous fishing-net-like structure. There are many proteins involved in the formation of tight junctions, including structural proteins (e.g. occludin, claudin, and JAM) and regulatory proteins (e.g. E-cadherin, actin, myosin, and cingulin). Tight junctions not only maintain cell polarity, but also selectively modulate the passive transfer of ions and macromolecules, forming a physical permeability barrier that limits bacterial and bacterial product transfer, making tight junctions important intestinal mechanical barrier components. Chemical barrier. This barrier is comprised of intestinal mucus secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and a variety of digestive and intestinal digestive enzymes mediating various chemical reactions. Mucus lubricates the intestinal mucosa and protects it against mechanical and chemical injury. Glycoproteins and glycolipids secreted by intestinal goblet cells can be combined with bacteria, so that bacteria are discharged with intestinal fluid under the force of fluid flow. Lysozyme cleaves gram-negative cell-wall peptidoglycan bonds resulting in bacterial lysis. Bile can combine with endotoxin to form detergent-like complexes that prevent endotoxin absorption through the intestine and cholic acid can degrade endotoxin molecules. Secretory IgA (SIgA) present in bile can opsonize bacteria preventing their attachment to epithelial surfaces. These broad-ranging components are important members of the intestinal barrier system. Biological barriers. The GI tract is sterile in fetuses and following exposure to the external environment after birth the neonatal intestine becomes colonized via the oropharynx which then leads to GI tract colonization which is also exposed to microbes present in food. The small intestine and the colon are the last intestinal components to become colonized. Bacterial growth and reproduction in the colon establish an important intestinal biological barrier. Intestinal flora under physiological conditions remain relatively stable and the intimate interactions of the various bacterial populations between themselves and the intestinal epithelium create a physiological bacterial barrier consisting mainly of intestinal anaerobic bacteria combined with intestinal mucosa that prevents colonization with potential pathogens. However, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics can cause bacterial imbalances, tipping the scale in favor of antibiotic-resistant pathogens not part of the normal flora. In summary, the normal flora maintains a dynamic balance in the intestine by preventing colonization with pathogens (contact inhibition), competing with pathogens for nutrients and producing bacteriocin and other anti-microbial factors. Immunological barrier. This barrier is comprised of the intestinal immune system that neutralizes pathogenic bacteria and their products via cellular and humoral responses. Lymphocytes comprise one of the primary effector cell types of the immune system and the body's largest lymphoid tissue, the intestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), is situated in the gut. There are two different intestinal lymphocyte phenotypes: intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIEL) scattered throughout the intestinal epithelium and submucosal tissues rich in lymphocytes. Peyer's patch lymph nodes are another important lymphoid tissue. The cavity surface of Peyer's patch lymph nodes is covered with follicular epithelium which constitutes a single-cell complex comprised of columnar epithelial cells, goblet cells and microvilli. This complex forms lymphoid follicles under the epithelium. SIgA is the major intestinal immunoglobulin. The main function of SIgA is antigen binding that prevents antigens from passing through the intestinal mucosa. In addition, intestinal mucosal cells may also secrete IgE, IgM and IgG that are also important in mediating humoral immunity in the intestine.",

            "text": "Understanding the complexities associated with intestinal dysfunction can be extrapolated from understanding intestinal failure, a concept proposed by Irving in 1956. Intestinal failure was defined as 'the overall reduction of functional gut, unable to digest and absorb food' as was observed in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS). In 1981, Fleming and Remingtor stated that 'it was hard to maintain intestinal minimum needs of digestion and absorption of nutrients as the intestinal function fell'. In 1986, Carrico stated that 'the gut is the start organ of multiple organ failure'. In 1992, in the diagnosis criteria of multiple organ failure, Deitch established standards of intestinal injury, namely, bloating and food intolerance for more than 5 d and that the standard of failure should be stress ulcers and acute cholecystitis. In 1996, Wilmore proposed that the intestine is one of the primary organs affected in patients under stress and, in 2001, Nightingale stated that 'due to the reduction of intestinal absorption, supplementation of nutrition and water, electrolytes are needed to maintain health and (or) growth'. Although nearly 50 years have passed, our understanding of the intestinal function is still limited to the processes of digestion and absorption. In the 1980s, the basic understanding of the intestinal function was its role in food digestion, nutrient absorption and GI hormone secretion. When the body is under stress, the gut is in 'hibernation'. During shock, intestinal blood is redistributed to the liver, lungs, kidneys and other organs. In the 1970s, when our understanding of 'multiple organ failure' began to be better defined, there were no established criteria for defining intestinal failure. During the 1980s, it was noted that burn victims not suffering from wound infections could have bacteria recoverable from the blood. Furthermore, these bacteria were derived from the intestine and described as an 'enterogenic infection'. It has been confirmed in animal experiments that the intestinal mucosa has barrier function properties and that hypoxia and ischemia can impair the intestinal mucosal barrier function, defined by bacterial and endotoxin translocation into the lymph or blood circulation [10] . This phenomenon can be observed in animal models but in the human body it is still difficult to obtain direct proof. However, many recent reports indirectly confirmed the existence of intestinal bacterial and endotoxin translocation in the human body. Surgical procedures or illnesses contributing to the development of intestinal hypoxia and ischemia are associated with gut mucosal barrier dysfunction resulting in bacterial translocation associated with SIRS and sepsis that can progress to MODS.",

Under conditions of bowel dysfunction resulting from malnutrition, atrophy of the intestinal mucosa can occur and the villi height decreased. Intestinal permeability can be defined using the L/M (mannitol/lactulose) test that allows physicians to determine whether damage to the intestinal epithelial barrier has occurred.

Indirect methods of monitoring the intestinal barrier function are widely used however, and include determination of intestinal permeability to macromolecules to indirectly confirm bacterial translocation. Clinical measurements of intestinal permeability to macromolecules can be carried out using a variety of water-soluble probe molecules that cannot be metabolized, can partly pass through the mucosal barrier and are quickly recoverable in urine. Commonly used molecular probes include PEG400 (5.3\u00c5), mannitol (6.7\u00c5), rhamnose (8.3\u00c5), lactulose (9.5\u00c5), cellobiose (10.5\u00c5), 51 Cr-EDTA (11\u00c5), 99mTc-DPTA (11\u00c5). PEG400, mannitol and other small molecules can directly pass through villus epithelial tight junctions. Data derived from using these probes were used to estimate villus epithelial tight junction permeability. Lactulose, 99mTc-DPTA and other large molecular probes are mainly absorbed through duct cell tight junctions and the recovery of these probes is a reflection of duct cell tight junction permeability. Combined use of small and large molecular probes, such as the dual-sugar method M/L ratio method can be used to assess the permeability of two types of tight junctions. In recent years, \"Pulsed Electrochemical Detection in High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-PED)\" represents the most advanced method of measuring M/L permeability. Studies have shown that the M/L ratio correlated with the degree of trauma. In recent years, reports have also demonstrated that serum D-lactate and diamine oxidase (DAO) concentrations reflected intestinal barrier permeability. The using Chamber is another instrument used for studies assessing intestinal drug absorption and intestinal barrier function and is considered the most effective and direct advanced equipment to monitor the electrophysiological changes occurring in intestinal mucosal cells.",

Bacteria not killed in macrophages by this process are free to elicit peritoneal infections. The functional status of macrophages, as carriers of bacteria, is considered to exert influence on bacterial translocation. However, in cases of trauma, shock or stress, the situation is different. Due to ischemia (reperfusion injury), the mucosa can suffer varying degrees of damage, including microstructure changes and cell tight junction damage which are exploited by bacteria in the translocation process leading to infection. Bacterial endotoxins can more easily pass through the mucosal barriers compared to whole bacteria, so bacterial translocation as a result of stress is often accompanied by endotoxemia which in turn causes further damage to mucosal barriers and further increases mucosal permeability facilitating bacterial translocation.",

Some of these compounding factors include a growing population of elderly patients, patients undergoing chemo-and radio-therapies, increased incidence of diabetes and cancer and a growing immune-suppressed population. These risk factors, combined with the weakened resistance of surgical patients following the use of anesthesia and surgical trauma, traumas caused by a variety of accidental injuries, the increased number of major surgeries and increased frequency of prosthetic surgical procedures, have significantly increased the chances for patients to develop intra-abdominal infections. Despite the use of multiple new antibiotics and novel treatment methods, sepsis and other complications caused by traumatic infections are still difficult to prevent and treat. In the United States, severe wound infections leading to sepsis and shock (especially multiple organ failure) are the 10 th leading cause of death in surgical patients. About 30% of surgical ICU patients suffer from sepsis leading to multiple organ dysfunction or failure that has become one of the major causes of death in surgical patients. It is clear from these observations that surgeons need to focus on establishing novel prevention strategies designed to curb the frequency of surgery and trauma-related infections.",

Awareness of surgical asepsis must be emphasized and operating room management must be strengthened [14] . In particular, emergency surgeries, preoperative hospital stays, operation times and the patient's health must be considered in the context of bacterial infections. The risk of surgical site infections can be significantly reduced if the following risk factors are addressed [15] . Maintaining normal temperature. Independent of the use of general, spinal or epidural anesthesia, patient body temperature can decrease by 1 -3 , resulting in significant reductions in the immune function and reduced surgical site blood flow, resulting in an increased risk of SSIs. Therefore, the use of thermal equipment and measures to maintain body temperatures at or above 36 during surgical procedures is recommended. Optimizing oxygen tension. Post surgical administration of 80% oxygen has been shown to reduce post-surgical wound infections and postoperative nausea and vomiting rates [16] . Therefore, it is recommended that intubated surgical patients receive 80% oxygen (>12 L/min) via inhalation using a non full-face breathing mask for up to 2 hours post surgery. Blood glucose control. Maintaining blood glucose levels at a stable level is especially important for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Furthermore, control of pre-surgical blood sugar levels is particularly critical since elevated blood glucose increases the risk of postoperative infections (POI). Hyperglycemia has been linked to leukocyte function abnormalities, including granulocyte adherence, impaired phagocytosis and delayed chemotaxis. These leukocyte deficiencies are associated with increased infections and infection risks have been shown to be reduced if glycemic control is maintained. Using a closed-looped artificial pancreas system to maintain constant glycemic levels without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia might be a safe and useful blood glucose control system in critically ill surgical patients [17] . At present, however, the preoperative optimal target range for blood glucose to reduce POI remains undefined. Depilation of the surgical site. Traditional shaving one day prior to surgery has proven ineffective in preventing infections and in some cases promotes colonization of the shaved sited since some microorganisms colonize shaving-associated micro abrasions. Surgical areas that have limited amounts of hair do not necessitate shaving and areas with more hair can be shaved using clippers or an electric razor and this can be carried out immediately before surgery in the operating room (particularly if razors are to be used, e.g., craniotomy). Surgical environment. It is important to strictly abide by the principles of aseptic surgery. Infections of the incision site are related to loss of live tissues, residual foreign bodies, blood clots or dead space. To date, wound irrigation with antibiotic-containing solutions is not common practice. Hospital stay. A simple, cost-effective means of reducing infections is to remove patients from hospital environments as quickly as possible so as to remove them from an environment containing an array of pathogens capable of infecting the surgical site.",

            "text": "There is no question that antibiotics serve as an effective prophylactic strategy for the prevention of SSI but they are not needed for all operations. Generally, Class I incisions (clean incisions) are carried out under strict aseptic conditions and should not require prophylactic antibiotic use. Prophylactic antibiotics are used for Class II incisions (clean incision) and the less contaminated Class III incisions. Most serious contamination is associated with Class III and IV type incisions. These include open wounds and gastrointestinal perforations that should be treated with antibiotics before and after surgery. Specific indications of prophylactic antibiotic use. (i) Class II incision cleaning involves wounds with contamination at the wound site, typically involving surgery of the GI tract, oropharynx, respiratory tract and the female reproductive tract. (ii) The use of artificial materials or manually operated devices, such as artificial heart valve replacement surgery, artificial vascular grafts or artificial joint replacement surgery. (iii) Major surgery or surgery lasting for many hours, trauma patients or in the case of infections, serious, consequences such as craniotomy and heart surgery, establishing portosystemic shunts or carrying out splenectomies. (iv) Patients with risk factors for infection, such as old age, diabetes, immune dysfunction or malnutrition. Parameters associated with prophylactic antibiotic usage. (i) The first dose should be administered before incision. The timing of administration is critical and should start 20 -30 min before surgery (during induction of anesthesia) to ensure delivery prior to any potential contamination and so that appropriate antibiotic tissue concentrations are reached (MIC > 90). Antibiotics should be administered in the operating room. In order to avoid infusion reactions, fluoroquinolones and vancomycin should be administered 2 h before surgery. The use of vancomycin as a prophylactic is limited to use when there exists a potential risk of MRSA infections. Post surgery antibiotic treatments should be stopped within 24 h since it has been demonstrated that extending prophylactic antibiotic usage past this time does not diminish infection risks. (ii) The entire dosage of prescribed antibiotics should be administered for maximum efficacy. The upper range of the dose should be considered for larger patients or those undergoing longer operations. Specifically, antibiotic dosing should be based on a patient's weight or body surface area. Cephalosporins that have a serum half-life of 1 -2 h are commonly used to ensure that effective drug concentrations are maintained during the entire surgical procedure, particularly if the operation exceeds 3 -4 h. In these cases, up to three dosages may need to be administered. Antibiotics should be administered intravenously and administration completed within 20 -30 min. Delivery should take place drop-wise and slowly to achieve effective concentrations. (iii) Re-dosing should be considered for longer surgery, for example, patients undergoing surgery that extends beyond two antibiotic half-lives should be re-dosed during surgery. Generally, the antibiotics selected for this process should be of short-range use and should not be used during elective surgeries. If the patient presents significant risk factors for infection, particularly during surgery involving prosthesis or implants, antibiotic use can be extended for several days or even until the stitches are removed to reduce the risk of developing SSIs. (iv) Choosing an appropriate antibiotic is also critical to ensuring success. Antibiotics should be chosen on the basis of their effectiveness against pathogens most likely to be encountered during the course of a particular surgery rather than selecting broad-spectrum antibiotics. Common microbial targets considered during antibiotic selection include microbes comprising the normal skin flora (e.g. staphylococci). In these cases, first-generation cephalosporins are frequently selected. Although intravenous administration is the most common route, combinations of oral and intravenous routes can also be used. If anaerobic infections are expected, metronidazole and other anti-anaerobic-selective drugs can be used. From an economic, safety and antibiotic-resistance perspective, it is recommended that relatively narrow-spectrum antibiotics be selected and to avoid the use of new, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. The preventive treatments for fungal infections remain controversial.",

            "text": "At present, treatment of surgical and traumatic infections primarily employs the use of antibiotics. However, antibiotics are not capable of effectively controlling some infectious agents due to the development of widespread drug-resistance. This problem should prompt us to modify our use of antibiotics to minimize the emergence of resistant strains by first determining the antibiotic resistance profile of respective clinical isolates. This will allow for the selection of the most effective antibiotic for the treatment of specific infections. A better understanding of how antibiotics function (including their mechanism of action and its impact on microorganisms and the human body) will also help to select the most effective antibiotics for the treatment of different infections. This knowledge is important since some antibiotics increase bacterial toxin production (e.g. lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan). The release of antibiotic-induced endotoxin is both dose-and drug-dependent. Experiments measuring E. coli endotoxin release in the presence of antibiotics at doses 50-fold, the MIC showed that endotoxin release was unchanged in the presence of meropenem or imine, but differences were observed in the presence of ceftazidime. Selecting antibiotics that confer their antimicrobial effects via different mechanisms may circumvent the problems observed with antibiotics that increase toxin production, e.g. rifampicin led to minimal release of lipoproteins and teichoic acids; half as much as were released in the presence of dalfopristin and a quarter of the amount released in the presence of ceftriaxone. Clinically, we want not only to clear the pathogen but also to minimize toxin production associated with antibiotic usage. This will require experiments that define toxin-production profiles for different antibiotics.",

At the same time, PN can supplement nutrients that cannot be delivered by EN. It is important in the context of disease prevention that the structure and function of the small intestine should be maintained in septic patients. PN is conducive to maintaining intestinal integrity and function and in stabilizing the growth of normal intestinal flora, while at the same time reducing endotoxin release and bacterial translocation. PN should be administered as long as the patient's intestinal anatomy and function remain intact. PN can be first administered when sepsis patients with different degrees of intestinal dysfunction cannot receive EN. As the disease stabilizes, both PN and EN can be administered prior to transitioning to EN or oral diets. The main principles of gastrointestinal dysfunction treatment in the context of MODS are to prevent occult shock, improve GI ischemia, restore the intestinal architecture and GI motility. Once GI function is restored, early enteral nutrition can be started. In addition, EN will effectively stimulate the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier, reduce inflammation and prevent gut-pathogen associated sepsis.
