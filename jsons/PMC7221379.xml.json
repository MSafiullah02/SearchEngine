This novel coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019. Since then, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization escalated the declaration to a Pandemic. Currently this viral infection has spread to more than 180 countries, with confirmed positive cases greater than 3 million people and associated deaths exceeding 210,000 individuals. The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States on January 20, 20201. Subsequently about 950,000 patients have been confirmed to be infected and greater than 56,000 patients have died, with an ongoing and seriously concerning rapid increase in the number of patients, and deaths associated with COVID-19. Many countries, including the United States, have now reported community spread of COVID-19.",

The third neonate was born prematurely at 31 weeks gestation due to fetal distress. This study presented limited information regarding a detailed timing of separation of the newborns from the mother and other family members with COVID-19 who may have been in close contact with the newborns after delivery. There was also insufficient information on the method of feeding for the neonates, all of which makes it difficult to determine if the infection among these newborns was vertically or horizontally transmitted. In a case series by Zhu et al. outcomes of 10 neonates, including two pairs of twins, born to mothers with COVID-19 were reported13. One neonate died, six were born premature (31 to 34 weeks gestational age), and two were small for their gestational age. None of the newborns that got tested (with nasopharyngeal swabs) for SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed positive.

Using a negative real time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test from throat swabs and blood samples they observed virus specific antibodies detected in the serum of all six newborns despite no physical contact with the mother after delivery14. Two infants had IgG and IgM levels higher than the normal level (<10 AU/mL) and inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly increased in all infants. None of the infants presented with any symptoms as of March 8, 2020. In their editorial comment regarding this case series as well another case report published on the same day14\n,\n15, Kimberlin et al. expressed caution in interpreting the results from these reports16. IgM antibodies have a large polymeric structure and thus do not cross the placenta. When IgM antibodies are found in a newborn, they may reflect fetal production following in-utero infection. IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for congenital infections has a lower sensitivity / specificity than molecular diagnostic tests based on nucleic acid amplification and detection, and may have higher false-positive or false-negative results. One of the case reports described a very rapid decline in the level of IgM antibodies in these newborns15, which is very unusual for IgM levels in other congenitally acquired infections in which they typically last for a few months. Given this information, it remains unclear if these reports represented a true congenital infection, or just an artifact of resulting antibody levels.",

There needs to be a local institutional plan in place for such situations, so patients can be cared for safely and transferred out, if needed, with prior preparation for safe transports. Due to significant usage of oxygen while caring for patients with COVID-19 throughout the hospital, a back up system to ensure continuous oxygen supply should be devised. Our institution has established staffing and employee wellness task forces to identify external clinical resources and support our staff who may be asked to care for COVID-19 patients. There are daily multidisciplinary leadership and management calls to set an operational tempo, assess preparedness, and prioritize enterprise-wide action. We developed a plan for our NICU regarding census and staffing, involving clear directions for patient care and when to initiate transferring patients out if needed. There should also be a plan for cohorting of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the NICU and well-baby nursery if space becomes an issue. Medical service providers will also be under tremendous psychological pressure due to overwork, shortage of medical resources, patients' poor outcomes, infection among their colleagues, or other detrimental experiences.",

Children seem to be less affected with this infection based on the limited published literature, however, one of the most vulnerable pediatric patient populations is cared for in NICUs. Current data on the effects of COVID-19 in fetal life and among neonates after birth is uncertain. As such, there is a need for proactive preparation and planning to manage these viral infections in neonates in ways that safeguard the patients, their families, and the healthcare personnel providing their care. Our understanding of COVID-19 is still evolving; therefore, we strongly suggest continuously monitoring the latest updates from CDC and local health authorities. Every health care facility should evaluate their available resources and make locally suited guidelines to take care of newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, consistent with recommendations from CDC.",
