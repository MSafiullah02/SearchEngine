The outer shell mainly protects virus from physical, chemical, or enzymatic damage. Following entry into the cell by specific receptors (Table 48.1\n), the virus uses the host cellular regulatory system and the host cells synthetic machinery to produce enzymes required for its replication, and in many cases the viral genome encodes proteins, which act, for example, as RNA-polymerases, transcriptases that are needed in replication. These components are then assembled and released as viral particles. Viruses also use host cell ribosomes to translate viral proteins. Viruses can only replicate within cells. Thus, viruses are an exception to what is understood as the concept of \u201clife.\u201d",

            "text": "In general, there are three main and well-established approaches to identify a virus in the human (for overview, see Striebel et al., 2003):(i)Isolation and cultivation techniquesThese techniques have some disadvantages, in particular long cultivation times from 3 up to 30 days, lack of sensitivity, and the rather limited number of viruses that can be identified in comparison to the broad spectrum of possible viruses that cause infection and/or disease. Identification of isolates from cell cultures occurs by titration with different serum pools. This is additionally hampered by constant evolving of new viral subtypes. Alternatively, type specific detection may directly be performed using monoclonal antibodies, immunofluorescence, or enzyme immunoassay (EIA).(ii)Indirect virus detection by virus-specific antibodiesIndirect virus detection methods include serological determination of specific antibodies by immunofluorescence assay, enzyme immunoassay, or by titration. After infection, only a few viruses release antigens in amounts sufficient to be detectable in body fluids by antibody assays (ELISAs). The presence of antibodies indicates immunity of the human organism in most virus infections, whereas re-infections do not show any symptoms. Antibody generation is detectable shortly after disease breaks out (e.g., in patients with viral hepatitis), but not during the highly infectious incubation time. Diagnosis of infections by cytopathogenic viruses, such as influenza or respiratory infections, may be easily performed in late states of these diseases, but are hardly possible during early disease states. While serotyping of viruses is mostly done by conventional immunological methods, many clinical isolates remain unclassifiable due to the limited number of antibodies against virus surface proteins, for example, of enteroviruses. Array-based assays are able to detect several\nserotypes with high accuracy. Highly sensitive array-based assay may become a useful alternative in clinical diagnostics.(iii)Direct detection of viral antigen or genomic featuresNucleic acid detection methods in virology may be separated into two basic groups: in vitro nucleic acid-amplifying techniques such as PCR including reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and non-amplifying techniques. Analysis of virus specific nucleic acids without in vitro amplification may be performed best by hybridization of gene specific probes, followed by radioactive or immunological detection methods (i.e., ELISA, or chemiluminescence). Practical applications of these direct methods are rare, as sensitivities often are too low in comparison to quantitative real-time PCR or RT-PCR by LightCycler or TaqMan. However, PCR and RT-PCR bear increased risks of contamination by non-specific amplification products but the main limitation resides in the difficulty of designing compatible multiplex primer sets for large numbers of viruses to be screened in a single assay, being restricted to a limited number of viral families. By contrast, serial analysis of gene expression and differential display is a powerful high-throughput methodology (Conejero-Goldberg et al., 2005).\n",

With the original DNA chip technology, microarrays were prepared by high-speed robotic printing of complementary DNAs on glass. Because of the small format and high density of the arrays, hybridization volumes of 2 \u03bcL could be used that enabled detection of rare transcripts in probe mixtures derived from 2 \u03bcg of total cellular messenger RNA (Schena et al., 1995). Differential expression measurements were performed by means of simultaneous, two-color fluorescence hybridization in parallel. This microarray-based genome-wide expression analysis of 45 genes first provided an unbiased view of the transcriptional state of a cell population (from Arabidopsis).",

We screened thousands of clones by hand with an oligonucleotide just to find one insert. Of course, positive selection vectors facilitated screening, but still we had to do the hard stuff by hand. Today's DNA chip/array technology reverses that early approach. Instead of screening an array of unknowns with a defined probe like a synthetic oligonucleotide, PCR product or cloned gene, now a defined probe occupies the chip and then the chip is probed with the unknown sample. Today, identification of disease-relevant genes or proteins often starts with transcription profiling experiments on DNA chips and/or proteomics approaches. The interpretation of the measured data is largely based upon the complete sequences of the human genome and the most important model organisms, respectively.",

Microarrays and other chip assays are based on solid supports, usually glass. Measurements are commonly performed by fluorescence labeling and detection. In contrast to membrane-based macroscopic arrays, microarray/chip supports (substrates) are non-porous, and therefore prevent absorption of reagents and samples on the substrate matrix. Non-porosity permits fast removal of organic and fluorescence substances during chip microfabrication and application. Microarray/chip supports allow highly parallel reactions, as well as significant increase in accuracy of measured data (Schena, 2001).

Modern inkjet-like printers reduce the spot volume into the picoliter range. Efficient covalent immobilization of biological molecules on solid supports is a crucial step during microarray production (Pirrung, 2002).

Another covalent and direct immobilization of DNA on glass with oxidic surface (Jung et al., 2001) requires positioning of DNA droplets on a heated surface with an efficiency of 150\u2013300 fmol/mm2 during the coupling reaction. Lindroos et al. (2001) compared six different commercial slides with respect to fluorescence background, turnover efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. They found that attachment chemistry affects genotyping accuracy when mini-sequencing is used for genotyping on micro-arrays. Genotyping results were best when mercaptosilane-coated slides were used to attach disulfide-modified oligonucleotides. Diazotized chip surfaces are described for immobilization of unmodified oligonucleotides (Dolan et al., 2001). Using p-aminophenyltrimethoxysilane (ATMS), diazotization chemistry was developed, and microarrays were fabricated and analyzed. The method produced uniform spots containing equivalent or even larger amounts of DNA than those obtained by commercially available immobilization techniques Oligonucleotides with hairpin stem-loop structure and multiple phosphorothioate moieties in the loop were used to anchor the oligonucleotide to glass slides that are pre-activated with bromoacetamidopropylsilane (Zhao et al., 2001). Consolandi et al. (2002) describe two robust procedures for oligonucleotide microarray preparation based on polymeric coating. Chemical procedures include a glass functionalization step with \u03b3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-APTES, or poly-L-lysine, or polyacrylic acid-polyacrylamide co-polymer, which is covalently bound to the modified glass. A surface activation step allows attachment of amino-modified oligonucleotides. Results show high loading capacity, good uniformity, ready availability of immobilized DNA to hybridization targets, and stability to thermal cycles.",

In a first step, an oligonucleotide of 15 alternating adenine and thymidine nucleotides is synthesized directly on a glass support. The sequence carries an amino group at its 3\u2032-end and a psoralen group at its 5\u2032-end. Psoralen may be added using 2-[4\u2032-(hydroxymethyl)-4,5\u2032,8-trimethylpsoralen]-hexyl-1-O-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diiso-propyl)]phosphoramidite. A strand, which is complementary to the synthesized support oligonucleotide carrying a stem of five thymidines plus the favored cDNA sequence at its 3\u2032-end, is then hybridized to the support. In an irradiation step (2 m in at 280 nm), the psoralen function of the support oligonucleotide is bound covalently to the complementary sequence. Microarrays generated that way may be hybridized to single- or double-stranded, Cy3-labeled probe DNAs. Advantages of the psoralen-based technique are: oligonucleotides may be synthesized completely in the standard 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction; densities of immobilized oligonucleotides are optimally suited for subsequent hybridizations, and the light-driven coupling process may be performed in an aqueous environment without impairing bases or other parts of the DNA carrying the cDNA sequence (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 2004).",

            "text": "In addition to spotting, oligonucleotide/DNA sequences can be grown directly on the microarray/chip. Photolithography opened the way for in situ fabrication of defined oligonucleotide arrays (Fodor et al., 1991). The oligonucleotide sequence grows on the surface of a glass wafer in a manner similar to conventional solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis but modified to include a light-sensitive deprotection step. Masks are used to add photospecific bases to selected points on the chip to create a series of oligo-nucleotides with a variety of different sequences. The process, which comprises solid-phase synthesis, photolithography, and affinity labeling, allows the synthesis of up to 250,000 different oligonucleotides (or oligopeptides) per square centimeter on a glass slide by light-directed, spatially addressable chemical synthesis with spot sizes of about 20 \u03bcm in diameter. Optimal spacer lengths are crucial for hybridization behavior and fluorescence yields. Different spacer compositions to reduce steric interference of immobilized oligonucleotides with the support were studied in order to improve hybridization behavior (Shchepinov et al., 1997). Optimal spacer length was determined to be at least 40 atoms in length, yielding up to 150-fold increase in hybridization. These spacers are composed of a variety of monomeric units that are synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry, by condensation onto an amino-functionalized polypropylene support (Matson et al., 1994). Steric hindrance during hybridization may also become problematic, if the immobilized oligonucleotides are too close to each other. Surface coverage was varied using a combination of cleavable and stable linkers. Results showed that highest hybridization yields were obtained from surfaces containing approximately 50% of the maximally possible oligonucleotide concentration.",

            "text": "High-density oligonucleotide arrays are one of these tools for large-scale hybridization. With their ability to produce global views of genome sequences and activity, they have emerged as a key analytical research tool. A vast amount of data must be collected and analyzed to understand biological functions. Affymetrix Inc. creates breakthrough tools for genomic applications. The unique combination of photolithography and combinatorial chemistry eliminates the need for individual laboratories to produce and test their own chips. Using technologies adapted from the semiconductor industry, GeneChip\u2122 manufacturing begins with a 5-inch square quartz wafer. Initially the quartz is washed to ensure uniform hydroxylation across the surface. Because quartz glass is naturally hydroxylated, glass provides a very good substrate for the attachment of chemicals such as linker molecules that are later used to position the probes on the chips. The wafer is placed in a bath of silane that reacts with the hydroxyl groups of the quartz glass surface, and forms a matrix of covalently linked molecules. The distance between these silane molecules determines the probes' packing density, allowing arrays to hold over 500,000 probe locations, or features, within a mere 1.28 cm2. Linker molecules attached to the silane matrix provide a surface that may be spatially activated by UV light. Probe synthesis occurs in parallel and results in the addition of an A, C, T, or G nucleotide to multiple growing chains simultaneously. To define which oligonucleotide chain will receive a nucleotide in each coupling (growing, propagation step), photolithographic masks, which carry 18\u201320 square micron windows corresponding to the dimensions of individual features, are placed over the coated wafer. The windows are distributed over the mask based on the desired sequence of each probe. When UV light is shone over the mask in the initial step of oligonucleotide synthesis, the exposed linkers become deprotected and are then available for nucleotide coupling. Critical to this step is the precise alignment of the mask with the wafer. To ensure that this critical step is accurately completed, chrome marks on the wafer and on the mask are perfectly aligned. Once the desired features have been activated, a solution containing a single type of deoxynucleotide with a removable protection groups is flushed over the wafer) surface. The nucleotide attaches to the activated linkers, initiating the synthesis process. Although the synthesis process is highly efficient, some activated molecules failed to attach the new nucleotide. To prevent these \u201coutliers\u201d from becoming probes with missing nucleotides, a capping step truncates them in each round of oligonucleotide synthesis. In addition, the side chains of the nucleotides are protected to prevent the formation of branched oligonucleotides. In the next round of synthesis, another mask is placed over the wafer to allow the next cycle of deprotection, coupling and capping. The cyclic process is repeated until the probes reach their full length, usually 25 nucleotides. Although each position in the sequence of an oligonucleotide can be occupied by one of four nucleotides resulting in an apparent need for 25 \u00d7 4 = 100 different masks per wafer, situations are identified when the same mask can be used repeatedly. Once the synthesis is complete, the wafers are deprotected and diced. Disadvantages of this method are oligonucleotide lengths that are limited to approximately 30 nucleotides, as well as an unfavorable oligonucleotide orientation, where the 3\u2032-end is bound to the solid support. This is important since hybridization efficiencies depend on orientation and accessibility of the immobilized probe (Southern et al., 1999). A further disadvantage of photolithographic array generation is the accumulation of truncated sequences that cannot be removed (fidelity of the synthesis process: F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 1994). For optimal performance, for example, of a photolithographically generated microarray, requirements are therefore (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 1994): (i) Minimization of failure sequences during chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides. This may be achieved by keeping side reactions of chemical synthesis low. Side reactions comprise clustering, depurination in the detritylation reaction, substitution of nucleotides at nucleobases, or breaking of internucleotide bonds. (ii) Minimization of homologous sequences. Oligonucleotides become increasingly more similar in their physico-chemical properties with increasing chain lengths. Therefore, sequences of the type N-1, N-2, N-3, and so forth (N stands for the number of nucleotides in the projected probe oligonucleotide/DNA sequence) are to be minimized by optimization of the coupling and capping reactions. (iii) Suppression of incomplete reactions during chemical cycles. Incomplete reactions are due to masking of non-converted ends by degradation of protection groups. (iv) High reproducibility of chemical syntheses within single steps.",

Yields, coupling and capping efficiencies only relate to single-reaction steps, but do not consider the length N of projected probe sequences; therefore, these parameters do not say anything about the frequency distribution of failure (truncated, false, erroneous) sequences, and they do not express the dynamics with multi-cyclic syntheses. If syntheses of different nucleotide lengths are compared regarding the optimization of external and internal synthesis conditions, then a lower yield of achieved full length sequences does not mean poorer synthesis conditions. Synthesis conditions leading to more probe sequences of lengths N are better optimized if fewer false sequences are synthesized (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 1995a, b, 1996, 1997a, b, 1998). From theoretical considerations, exact measures of cyclic multistep syntheses, such as chemical oligonucleotide/DNA/RNA/peptide syntheses, were derived. The studies showed that fractal dimensions are such measures for oligonucleotide/DNA/RNA/peptide syntheses. They are superior to commonly used parameters like trityl yield and coupling efficiencies, and they can be applied to the experimental separation of crude synthesis products by high-resolution ion-exchange HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, and gel electrophoresis. Based on experiments, the dynamics of the syntheses on solid support was modeled by stochastic processes with nucleotide chain length N, propagation/elongation (coupling, oxidation), and termination (capping) probabilities as the basic parameters. The following Eqn. 48.1 provides an exact measure for quantitative assessment and comparison of multi-cyclic syntheses of different target length, such as chemical oligonucleotide/DNA/RNA/peptide syntheses:(48.1)D(N,d0)=2\u2212Nd0N\u221211\u2212d0N\u221211n1d0\n",

The simplest approach is direct labeling of the viral target DNA with fluorophores. Common methods employ enzymatic incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides, or PCR amplification with fluorescent primer pairs. RNA probes are usually prepared from cloned DNA by incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides via RNA polymerase. Selection of fluorescence dyes for primer labeling depends on the filter system of the microarray reader and scanner, respectively. As fluorescence dyes are large hydrophobic molecules, care has to be taken to avoid intercalation of these dyes during PCR (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 2001a, b). Suitable dyes that provide a good long-time stability, such as cyanide dyes Cy3 or Cy 5, are commercially available. Cyanide dyes show an intensive fluorescence and are all water-soluble. This property, combined with their good quantum yield, makes them superior to many other fluorescence dyes (Wessendorf and Brelje, 1992).",

The review article of Caminade et al. (2006) focuses on the improvements that hyperbranched and perfectly defined dendrimers also called nanomolecules can provide to DNA microarrays. Two main uses of dendrimers for such purpose have been described up to now (Caminade et al., 2006). Either the dendrimer is used as linker between the solid surface and the probe oligonucleotide, or the dendrimer is used as a multilabeled entity linked to the target oligonucleotide. In the first case the dendrimer generally induces a higher loading of probes and an easier hybridization, due to moving away the solid phase. In the second case, the high number of localized labels (generally fluorescent) induces an increased sensitivity, allowing the detection of small quantities of biological entities.",

Most image capture instruments and microarray readers, respectively, use a scanning detector similar to line-scanning detector systems for DNA sequencing instruments. The number of discrete points that the detector can sample across the array and the row-to-row step interval determine the size of the features that the detector can image. It is important that the detector pixels are sufficiently small to gather data from enough significant pixels in each probe cell. Confocal laser-scanning systems for fluorescent microarray biochips should have a spatial resolution of a detector on the order of 1/8 to 1/10 of the diameter of the smallest element in the microarray. While the absolute number of DNA molecules that can be crammed into a small space will probably prevent the field from reaching the 0.2 \u03bcm features found in semiconductors, 5 \u03bcm probe cells appear attainable.

            "text": "\nImage analysis is performed by placing a grid over the array to allow integration of the signal from each probe cell. If the signals from the arrays are strong and fairly consistent, a threshold algorithm is usually adequate, but weak signals demand a computationally intensive approach. The background signal or baseline is the fluorescence from the support matrix. Raw fluorescence intensity data are background subtracted. Hybridization outcomes can be represented as log2 fluorescence intensity ratio of test versus reference samples. To virtually enrich viral specific concordant probes, data filtration can be further filtered by elimination of spots below signal intensity and a predefined absolute log2 ratio; this eliminates outlier data from further analysis due to labeling bias. The processing improves data correlation. Hierarchical clustering and visualization of data can be performed using Gene Cluster and Tree View software (Stanford University, USA). High-density DNA chips with thousands of probe cells need special managing software for microarray probe tracking and data analysis like Affymetrix's LIMS workstation, BioDiscovery's Clone Tracker software or GeneSpring, a software package offered by Silicon Genetics. Based on observed microarray hybridization patterns an algorithm called E-Predict is reported for microarray-based viral species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different viral species in a set of clinical samples but its relevance to other metagenomic applications is discussed (Urisman et al., 2005).",

Viral genotyping is an approach made possible by the availability of viral gene and genome sequence databases and technical and conceptual advances in chip technology. Interest exists in providing high-throughput platforms and readout technologies that can selectively examine changes in the transcript levels of specific genes in response to multiple treatments. Although conventional microarrays (DeRisi et al., 1996; Schena et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2002) have, in principle, the necessary throughput, they were limited with respect to cost and dynamic range and therefore are not well suited for the task of producing genotyping data for multiple viruses from which accurate reliable information can be calculated. For routine clinical testing, it is not possible to test thousands of genes on a microarray. Therefore, some researchers have called for \u201cless\u201d genes to be put on the array, because most of the other data points are inconsequential (Wooster, 2000) or even detrimental to the usefulness of a set of classifier genes (Draghici et al., 2003). Can array data be used to identify a handful of critical genes that will lead to a more-detailed taxonomy and can this or similar array data be used to predict clinical outcome (Wooster, 2000)?",

            "text": "In practice, there may be some pitfalls, as exemplified by long-term variability studies of the human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome. The HSV-1 genome consists of iterative DNA sequences of variable amounts. The HSV-1 genome from a HSV-1 DNA pool has an isomolar genome organization with L and S components. Genome complexity is due to tetra-isomers derived from the rolling circle-like intracellular replication process. In the L-S region, transient variabilities are formed by insertions or deletions of the repetitive a-sequences. The genomic changes are more or less strain-specific. Outside the L-S junction the virus progeny under study showed no or negligible deviations from the parent strain. The viral DNA material of three HSV-1 strains F (Roizman), Mst (Ulm) and AK (Ulm) was sampled after intracellular self-assembled virus particles were formed (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 1997a; Klauck et al., 1995). The DNA replication was carried out in Vero cell infections and the purified viral DNA was digested with BamHI restriction endonuclease (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 1997a). The resulting BamHI-K2-fragments of HSV-1 were extracted from agarose gels by electroelution, ligated into plasmid pBR322 or pAT153 and cloned in E.coli K 12 C600 cells for hybridization in Southern blots. The restriction patterns obtained by endonucleases KpnI, and SalI were analyzed by hybridization with K2-fragments of HSV-1 (F) labeled by the random priming method with [32P]\u03b1-dCTP. Blots were autoradiographed and the bands quantified by scanning densiometry. We found that the nucleotide sequence pattern of the HSV-1 genome in the L-S region can be approximated by distribution profiles of digested components expressed in powers of nucleotide length N of the largest component in the region. The largest components of interest studied had nucleotide length N of 13,500 base pairs obtained with KpnI of HSV-1 strains F, Mst, AK and nucleotide length N of 9730 base pairs obtained with SalI of HSV-1 strains F, Mst, AK. We obtained the fractal dimensions D = 1.63 (strain F), D = 1.66 (strain Mst), and D = 1.66 (strain AK) with restriction endonuclease KpnI. With restriction endonuclease SalI, we found the fractal dimensions D = 1.36 (strain F), D = 1.36 (strain Mst), and D = 1.39 (strain AK). The fractal dimension D is here a measure for producing internal repeats in the L-S region of strains F, Mst, AK during replication at the viral genome level (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 1997a). Here, a lower value of the fractal dimension D indicates a distribution of sequence variability with lower amounts of internal repeats. The fractal dimension D was obtained from the scaling to the largest nucleotide length of interest, N, and is interpreted as typical long-term DNA sequence variability.",

For example, a viral chip was designed after dividing each viral genome into overlapping 70-mer oligonucleotides using sequencing analysis tools BLASTn (Wang et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004). The 70-mers were ranked by the number of viral genomes to which significant homology were found by alignments.

The novel virus, named XMRV, is closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), but its sequence is clearly distinct from all known members of this group. Attempts to identify differentially expressed transcripts in complex neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, have shown the necessity of screening a large sample set in order to rule out medication effects and normal individual variation when attempting to determine disease association (Conejero-Goldberg et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2002). The genome wide gene expression profile aids in the understanding of genes that may be regulated in a particular pathological condition-like cardiovascular disease and how it pertains to viral and parasitic infections of the heart (Mukherjee et al., 2006).",

Studies focusing on the analysis of viral populations from cells or tissues typically pose challenges owing to the high degree of complexity of a mixture of numerous viral species and the low abundance of many of the viruses, which necessitates highly parallelized analysis. The ability of viral chips to identify thousands of viruses from complex samples can be expected to impact broadly on biology and medicine (Wang et al., 2002). However, the use of viral chips for a diagnostic purpose is still limited because there is little agreement as to which portion of the viral genome is specific for diagnostics and allows establishment of intra- and inter-species relationships (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 1997a; Striebel et al., 2003).",

Since phenotype-based testing of resistance with virus isolation and growth on cell cultures is very time and labor consuming, genotype-based testing of resistance represents a meaningful alternative. In hepatitis C, duration and success of an interferon therapy mainly depends upon the HCV genotype (Zein, 2000), apart from other factors such as age, duration of infection and height of the HCV RNA titer before specific therapy starts.",

Preliminary studies are reported for quantification of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in serum (Kawaguchi et al., 2003). Because of the high clinical importance of virus quantification, in particular for estimation of virus replication and therapy monitoring, there is a great potential for chip application. For example, a quarter of the chronically infected people suffer from SNPs in the precore/basal core promoter region of the HBV genome, causing the loss of HBeAg expression. These HBeAg-negative patients often remain asymptomatic and viremic until the alanine aminotransferase level in serum is persistently elevated (Lai et al., 2003). It would therefore be important to develop methods to detect the precore/basal core promoter mutations of the HBV genome at an earlier stage of infection for large-scale clinical and diagnostic analysis. The conventional and common methods for detecting mutations such as single-strand conformation polymorphisms, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, direct sequencing and chemical cleavage are not practical for detecting multiple SNPs in high-throughput format. The arrayed primer extension method (APEX), which is based on a hybridization of short single-stranded DNA templates with an array of immobilized oligonucleotide probes on a glass surface followed by a polymerase-assisted incorporation of different fluorescently tagged dideoxynucleotides (Tonisson et al., 2000), enables large-scale SNP detection. All methods of mutant detection so far described can only identify mutants in the serum, and cannot determine the proportion of those mutants. Li et al. (2005) reported the development of a novel technique that can quantify the relative proportion of mutants in serum utilizing gene microarray technology.",

For example, the knowledge-based, low-density \u201cfocused\u201d microarray is based on the molecular diagnostics of six human herpesvirus types: HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, CMV, HHV-6 (F\u00f6ldes-Papp et al., 2004, 2005b; Striebel et al., 2004). These studies attempted to optimize parameters of chip design, surface chemistry, oligonucleotide probe spotting, sample labeling, and DNA hybridization. The well-designed and tailored chip platform developed utilizes low-fluorescence background coverslips, epoxy surface chemistry, standardized oligonucleotide probe spotting, PCR-labeling with Cy3 of isolated viral DNA, array hybridization, and detection of specific spot fluorescence by an automatic microarray reader. Korimbocus et al. (2005) reported on the simultaneous detection of major CNS pathogens HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV; all serotypes of human enteroviruses, and five flaviviruses (West Nile virus, dengue viruses, and Langat virus) using amplification by PCR and detection of amplified products by a DNA microarray. Consensus primers for the amplification of all members of each genus and sequences that are specific for the identification of each virus species were selected from the sequence alignments of each target gene. A multiplex PCR-based DNA array for EBV, CMV, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) may serve as a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for clinical applications (Fujimuro et al., 2006).",

QDs are characterized by broad absorption spectra from the ultraviolet to the far infrared, good photostability, and a narrow emission spectrum. These properties could improve the sensitivity of biological detection and imaging by 10- to 100-fold. Conjugated gold nanoparticles with nucleic acids were used as labels for DNA microarrays (Taton et al., 2000). With this method, target nucleic acids at concentrations of 500 femtomolar were detected (Bao et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2005; Park et al., 2002). QDs have also been applied to the detection of viral species (Perez et al., 2003).",

The nanosensor can detect less than 50 copies of DNA and has much less background fluorescence than conventional fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems. The nanosensor includes two oligonucleotide probes that bind to separate regions of an assayed strand of DNA (target DNA). The reporter probe is labeled with a Cy5 fluorophore, and the capture probe is labeled with biotin. The probes bind the target DNA, and a streptavidin-coated QD binds to the capture probe. This process brings the Cy5 molecule close to the QD for FRET to occur. Because QDs have broad absorption and narrow emission spectra, the QD-based nanosensor system can be finely tuned so that background fluorescence is negligible. QDs also concentrate the FRET signal by binding many target\u2013probe complexes. To detect FRET signals, the researchers developed a novel confocal fluorescence microscopy platform. The QD\u2013target\u2013probe complexes were continuously flowed through a microcapillary past two detectors that were specific for signals from either FRET donors or acceptors. When the system was tested with a single-stranded target DNA, the fluorescence was observed with both detectors. However, when the target was absent or when a non-complementary DNA strand was used, only donor fluorescence was observed. Wang and colleagues also compared the performance of the QD nanosensor with that of a molecular beacon, which is typically used in FRET assays. The QD nanosensor was about 100 times more sensitive. Finally, the researchers combined the nanosensor with an oligonucleotide ligation assay. This method allowed the discrimination of point mutations in DNA samples from ovarian cancer patients.",

They detect the molecular Brownian movement of fluorescent particles in a very tiny volume of the laser focus. Quantitative understanding of molecular interactions at the level of single molecules within single cells is the next step in basic and applied biomedical research for the analysis of the dynamics and localization of molecules in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes.",
