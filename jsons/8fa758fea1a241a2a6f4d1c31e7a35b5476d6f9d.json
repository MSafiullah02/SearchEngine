The consequences of these experience(s) include increased rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [9] , and increased likelihood of behavioural avoidance patterns [6, [10] [11] [12] ]. An HIV diagnosis may itself aggravate traumatic experiences; many women either relate their HIV diagnosis indirectly to experience of trauma or acquired HIV during a sexual assault [6, 13, 14] .

These restrictions complicate their journey to health. WLHIV often live in chronically under-resourced communities characterised by high rates of violence, substance use, and limited opportunities for employment. Beyond their immediate health-related needs, women rely on multiple socioemotional resources to cope with their trauma history and living with HIV.

Both globally and in South Africa there have been increased reports of gender-based and domestic violence since the implementation of COVID-19-enforced lockdowns. During the first week of the lockdown in South Africa, 87,000 cases of domestic and inter-personal violence were reported [16] . Individuals are stressed, frustrated and confined in close quarters. Vulnerable persons will be at heightened risk and rates of trauma will escalate. With rates of domestic violence increasing, any coping strategies our future participants may have are at risk of dissipating. Considering that many WLHIV have histories of intimate partner violence and many are currently in abusive relationships, the restrictions placed on their movement may impact their safety. In addition, many women will have to manage an increase in parenting demands-often without any emotional or practical support from their abusive partners. Furthermore, for women who have not disclosed their HIV status to an abusive partner, accessing HIV care may not be feasible without placing them at risk for violence. At a time when continuity of HIV-care engagement could provide reassuring consistency and mediate fears regarding COVID-19, WLHIV may instead be left unsupported and at heightened risk for domestic abuse.",

As South Africans will need to remain partially restricted in order to maintain control over the effects of COVID-19, an instinctive response is to provide \"remote\" services or \"telepsychiatry\". Indeed, these models can be highly effective in providing support, counselling and psychotherapy [17] .

The risk of COVID-19 transmission is limited when interactions occur on an individual one-on-one basis. For women on antiretroviral therapy who are still able to access HIV care, psychological treatment should be available and fast-tracked to reduce waiting times. Clinic managers and care providers need to consider this service essential. A second option is to train community health workers who are currently employed to find and track COVID-19 cases within resource-constrained communities, in basic counselling and support.",
