            "text": "Universal health insurance coverage is rarely found in developing countries. That is why international experts are greatly impressed by the universal coverage recently achieved by China, the world's largest developing country with 1.3 billion population. For example, a World Bank report praised China's achievement as \u201cunparalleled,\u201d [1] representing the largest expansion of insurance coverage in human history. One study concluded that China's experience is \u201cexemplary for other nations that pursue universal health coverage\u201d [2]. The achievement also drew attention of the mass media [3]. While China's success in coverage expansion is widely recognized, few studies have systematically examined reasons for the success. This study aims to fill the gap. The study findings will help answer three questions that are of interest to policymakers and researchers both within and without China:1.What are the major drivers for China's achievement of universal health insurance coverage?2.What are the policy challenges for sustaining the achievement in the next decade?3.What lessons can be learned from China's experience?\n",

While the past three decades have witnessed China's economic take-off, the country's health care system has not kept pace with the economic development [5], [6]. As government officials became increasingly occupied by economic development, government health expenditures dropped from 37% of total health expenditures in 1980 to 18% in 2004 [7]. The economic reform also unexpectedly led to serious deterioration in insurance coverage [8], [9], with insurance rate falling to 5% and 38% in rural and urban areas respectively in 1998 [4], [10]. Many researchers were alarmed by the falling coverage, and some researchers started experimental studies in the 1990s in an effort to rebuild the health insurance system, especially in rural China [11], [12], [13]. While the studies produced a wealth of experience that was eventually drawn on by Chinese policymakers, the studies did not lead to immediate policy actions, especially at the national level. At the turn of the 21st century, deteriorating insurance coverage coupled with a rapid increase in health care costs pushed health care affordability to the top of the list of public's concerns [14].",

            "text": "Another reason for the public support for government intervention is the problems caused by privatization of China's health care system. While China's governments never formally published any privatization policies, they reduced political and/or public funding support substantially and forced doctors and health care facilities to function much like for-profit entities [23], resulting in the phenomenon of de facto privatization as concluded by researchers of the Chinese health care system [24]. For example, the barefoot doctor system in rural China, which was once praised by WHO as a successful example of providing health care services in developing countries [25], [26], declined rapidly after China's economic reform started in 1978 because it no longer enjoyed political backing from the central government and financial support from local governments and communities [27]. By the late 1980s, barefoot doctors either became private practitioners or were lost to other professions [22]. As another example, although 95% of hospital are owned by the governments, public funding is approximately 10% of hospital revenue [28]. To make a profit, hospitals heavily relied on over-prescribing drugs and diagnostic tests [29], [30], [31]. As a result, drug spending was about half of China's health expenditures, one of the highest shares in the world [32]. The privatization-induced overuse exacerbated the problem of health care affordability [33].",

The obligation may not be fulfilled for some time (e.g., in the 1980s\u20131990s when the governments focused on improving economic indicators), but it cannot be completely ignored by the governments as long as the state ideology remains unchanged [43]. The historical success in the 1960s\u20131970s when China was praised as an innovator in health care by the World Health Organization [20], [44], also reinforced the obligation in the 2000s after the 30-year economic growth.

For example, after China's success in insurance expansion, a large share of hospital revenues came from user charges that the three public insurance programs reimbursed. The policymakers may want to use the large amounts of insurance reimbursement as a useful tool for the ongoing hospital reform initiative to push hospitals for improving quality of care, reducing waste and inefficiency, and controlling growth of health expenditures. One option is to tie the insurance programs\u2019 reimbursement to hospital performance in improving quality and reducing waste and inefficiency as discussed above. Another option is to reform the insurance programs\u2019 provider reimbursement systems by replacing the fee-for-service payment method with prospective methods, such as capitation payment to primary care physicians, diagnosis-group-adjusted payment to hospitals, and bundled payment.

The central government, which intends the three public insurance programs to cover only basic health care, has decided to actively develop private insurance market to meet the additional needs of the publicly insured. However, the central government has not yet defined clearly the role for private insurance to play in China's health financing system. Without a clearly defined role, developing private insurance in China might raise concerns about inequality given prior study findings of negative impacts of supplemental private insurance on health care outcomes in countries with universal health insurance coverage [61], [62]. China's efforts to develop private insurance can be strengthened by (1) requiring the three public insurance programs to work with private insurance companies on reinsurance plans to mitigate the financial risk of the publicly insured and (2) investing in the country's health information system and training of health insurance experts, both of which will enable private insurers to differentiate their products to meet the consumers\u2019 diverse needs, rather than to engage in the current price competition on similar portfolios [63].",

One lesson that other developing countries can derive from this finding is that, to find their own path to universal coverage, they may want to adopt a combination strategy by taking advantage of both the unique characteristics of their own health care systems and some common factors that are shared with other countries\u2019 coverage expansion experiences. Such a combination strategy can be helpful for them to design coverage expansion options that are socio-politically feasible in their national contexts.",
