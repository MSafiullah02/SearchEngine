A cohort of 306 patients with confirmed or probable SARS, 183 of whom received ribavirin and 123 of whom did not, between February 23, 2003, and July 1, 2003. Of the 183 treated patients, 155 (85%) received very high-dose ribavirin; the other 28 treated patients received lower-dose regimens. Measurements and Main Results. Data on all patients with SARS admitted to hospitals in Toronto were abstracted from charts and electronic databases onto a standardized form by trained research nurses. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between ribavirin use and each adverse event (progressive anemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, bradycardia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia) after adjusting for SARS-related prognostic factors and corticosteroid use. In the primary logistic regression analysis, ribavirin use was strongly associated with anemia (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 99% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-6.1, p<0.0001), hypomagnesemia (OR 21, 99% CI 5.8-73, p<0.0001), and bradycardia (OR 2.3, 99% CI 1.0-5.1, p=0.007).

Data collection was retrospective, and the potential for several types of bias exist. Clinicians aware of potential ribavirin adverse events may have tested for, or recorded, these events more frequently in ribavirin-treated patients. Similarly, data abstractors may have searched more diligently for adverse events in the ribavirintreated patients. In addition, if patients with more severe SARS were more likely to be treated, disease-related effects would appear to be associated with treatment (selection bias). We attempted to minimize these biases by using study end points that were objective and were measured routinely in both treated and nontreated patients. Thus, anemia was considered a primary outcome, rather than hemolysis, as it could be defined based only on hemoglobin levels, which were routinely measured in all patients, as opposed to haptoglobin levels, which were ordered primarily in ribavirin-treated patients. To control for selection bias, we used logistic regression to adjust for factors predictive of severe SARS. Although these approaches cannot remove all of the bias inherent in a retrospective study, the results represent an improvement on previous reports of adverse events in patients treated with high-dose ribavirin that examined only small numbers of patients and/or failed to include a control group or adjust for confounding factors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study results confirm that high-dose ribavirin can cause hemolytic anemia and bradycardia and demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, a striking association between high-dose ribavirin use and hypomagnesemia. Previous studies suggest that 10% of patients with hepatitis C who were receiving ribavirin discontinue treatment due to cardiovascular or respiratory effects secondary to severe anemia. 29 We did not include cardiac or respiratory outcomes in our study, primarily because cardiac events were rarely reported in the cohort and the potential respiratory effects of ribavirin were impossible to distinguish from the primary manifestations of SARS itself. Thus, the clinical impact of these effects remains uncertain, although clinical markers including survival, transfusion requirements, and tetany were not more common among ribavirin-treated patients. However, our cohort was largely made up of young and previously healthy health care workers; only 15% of the cohort had any comorbid illness and only 5% had a history of cardiac or respiratory disease. In an older cohort with more comorbidity, the impact of ribavirinassociated hemolytic anemia may have been more severe.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "The ribavirin doses used for SARS in Toronto are at the boundary of what appears to be the maximum clinically tolerable dose. Given the clear association of high-dose ribavirin with several potentially severe adverse events and the high frequency of these events, several recommendations appear appropriate. High-dose oral or parenteral ribavirin should be used only in a monitored setting and only in patients without cardiac or respiratory conditions that would be exacerbated by an acute decline in hemoglobin level. Previous recommendations that high-dose oral ribavirin should be provided in the event of a mass casualty situation relating to a natural outbreak of an unknown hemorrhagic fever syndrome or a deliberate bioterrorist attack should be reassessed given these data. 8 Furthermore, the use of ribavirin outside of clinical trials should be restricted to the treatment of life-threatening conditions for which ribavirin has been demonstrated to improve outcomes. In the event of another SARS outbreak, the widespread use of ribavirin does not appear justified given equivocal in vitro and in vivo evidence of efficacy and clear evidence of toxicity. When outbreaks occur due to novel viral pathogens, we believe that the early use of high-dose ribavirin, even in the context of a controlled clinical trial, is not justifiable until the virus is isolated, in vitro testing demonstrates ribavirin activity at clinically achievable doses, and the natural history of the illness suggests that the potential benefits of ribavirin outweigh the
