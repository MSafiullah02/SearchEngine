Indeed, many studies have been performed to assess vaccine kinetics and cross-protection level promoted by different vaccines, through several experimental trials, administration routes and timing, settings, and evaluation methods, such as vaccine quantification from tracheal swabs (Jackwood et al., 2009 ), ciliostasis observation, or challenge virus detection (De Wit and Cook, 2014; Jackwood et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 353, "end": 369, "text": "(Jackwood, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 523, "end": 542, "text": "(Cook et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 677, "end": 700, "text": "(Valastro et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 913, "end": 929, "text": "(Cavanagh, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1278, "text": "(Cook et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1586, "text": "(Jackwood et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1667, "text": "(De Wit and Cook, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1690, "text": "Jackwood et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "An important adjustment has been introduced in the broiler vaccination program by moving up the second administration to the first d of age.

The rationale behind this approach was that a better tracheal epithelium recovery between administrations, a milder vaccination impact on animals with fewer adverse reactions (De Wit and Cook, 2014) , and a stronger immune response (van Ginkel et al., 2015) were proven.

Thus, the need for providing vaccines able to efficiently spread in field conditions and to induce good protection, even in the presence of other vaccines and co-infections, has led to commercialization of new vaccine strains and to the implementation of new administration plans, while minimizing at the same time the number of interventions. In the current study, the replication dynamics of different IBV vaccines coadministered at one d of life were investigated both in experimental and field conditions. As a matter of fact, a strict and extended monitoring of vaccine titers could allow verifying the vaccine administration efficacy from a managerial point of view and also from a biological one. In experimental conditions, viral titers displayed a common trend characterized by a rapid increase, reaching the highest values around 10 d, then decreasing until the conclusion of the trial. The only exception was represented by the behavior of B48 strain, when administered in combination with 1/96 strain, which did not appear before d 7, and it showed a titer rise in correspondence with the 1/96 expected decrease, thus testifying its persistence and replication during the early d, even if at extremely low levels, probably due to the prevailing 1/96 replication. The effects of this peculiar behavior of B48-1/96 co-administration on the vaccineinduced protection are not clear and will need further investigations. On the contrary, 1/96 strain did not present any major titer alteration, either by standing alone or in combination with B48 strain administration, thus supporting the inferences about the strong replication and co-replication ability of this vaccine strain (Figure 1 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2292, "end": 2301, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "When an analogous scenario was examined in the field, significantly overlapping results were obtained. Similar to the experimental conditions (Figure 1 ), an effect of both time and genotype was revealed on vaccine viral titers. Both genotypes displayed a positively skewed curve, with viral titer rapidly rising during approximately the first 2 wk of age and then progressively decreasing (Figure 1) . Particularly, the few negative results were mostly located at the very beginning of the cycle, when the viral replication could not be homogeneous among animals and the viral spreading could not have reached all the birds yet. In the last phase of the cycle, negative samples were more frequent, as a consequence of the generalized titer decline. Interestingly, the differences in the 2 strain kinetics highlighted a certain higher replication capacity for the Mass-like strains in the upper respiratory tract at first, opposite to the longer persistence of the 1/96 strain. This was partially mimicked by the dynamics in experimental conditions in which H120 and B48, when administered alone, displayed a higher titer compared with 1/96 until d 18 and 21, respectively. The end of the trial did not allow gathering further conclusions about the following B48 titer trend; neverthe-less, another study (Tat\u00e1r-Kis et al., 2016) explored the second half of the productive cycle of similarly vaccinated animals: B48 appeared always lower than 1/96, which displayed a notable persistence. Therefore, the observed pattern could be attributed to actual viral biological properties and not to the particular scenario.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1305, "end": 1329, "text": "(Tat\u00e1r-Kis et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 151, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 390, "end": 400, "text": "(Figure 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A separate discussion must be reserved to the interaction between the 2 vaccines. Even if presenting some dissimilarities, both vaccine trends were quite overlapping, and high viral titers were frequently encountered, hence suggesting the absence of a competition between the 2 genotypes, and a parallel coexistence also when administered on the same day. This clearly conflicts with the experimental evidences, in which an obvious interference was observed. Two main hypotheses can be introduced to explain this discrepancy; at first a Mass vaccine different from B48 is currently used in Italy, so the different biological properties of this virus could explain its lower susceptibility to 1/96 competition. Additionally, in field conditions, the Mass vaccine is often provided at the hatchery, while the 1/96 is provided upon arrival at the farm. Considering that a higher affinity for the tracheal receptor has been proposed as a source of the increased replication of 793/B genotypes (Cook et al., 1999) , this short lag phase between the 2 administrations could enhance the Mass vaccine cell adhesion and replication. It must be stressed also that experimental trials are often poorly representative of the sub-optimal conditions found in the field, and thus they should be interpreted with caution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 989, "end": 1008, "text": "(Cook et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In fact, comparing the prolonged vaccine persistence in the field with the experimental trial trend, the experimental conditions could have influenced the viral titers because of the small number of involved animals, leading to a lower viral circulation. On the other hand, a controlled environment could have minimized the risk of other infections or the presence of stressing and immunosuppressive conditions, placing the premises for unbiased results by other pathogens' competitive actions. The abovementioned field scenario raises a question about vaccine viral attenuation and the efficacy of the immune response, which appears to be insufficient for the vaccine clearance within production cycles, allowing a continuous re-infection of the animals because of a high environmental infectious burden.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "However, it must be clearly stated that the prolonged vaccine circulation could be advantageous by increasing the \"vaccination coverage\" and granting a protective effect ascribable also to the interference against the field strains. In fact, higher 1/96 strain titer seem to confer better protection against field strains. Literature reports how this particular genotype, in association with Mass vaccine administration, could ensure strong protection against QX strain (Terregino et al., 2008; Sarueng et al., 2014; Awad et al., 2016) , which is the most prevalent in Italy and the most detected one in this study as well. Moreover, the frequency of Italian QX outbreaks has been correlated to the 793/B vaccine application, with its peaks quite explained by the 793/B administration suspension (Franzo et al., 2016) . Afterward, a clear effect of the viral competition emerges from this study, because of the IBV field strain occurrence mainly in the second part of the productive cycle, when the vaccine titers are decreasing, but the immunity should still be effective because of the continuous stimulus imposed by vaccine circulation. Even if the sampling nature of this study has created a lack of information from the 22nd to the 30th d of the cycle, due to the primary aim of assessing the vaccination adequacy, the vaccine persistence, and possible field strain infection in the case of clinical symptoms, the viral titer trend suggested a similar decreasing behavior in that gap. So a slight underestimation of IBV field strains or aMPV entrance time also could have occurred, since their first detections from the 35th d of the cycle on, but this finding seems to be in line with the expected timing, especially for aMPV (Cavanagh et al., 1999; Cecchinato et al., 2013a) . As a matter of fact, another proposed competing effect is the one between IBV and aMPV (Cavanagh et al., 1999; Cook et al., 2001; Cecchinato et al., 2013a) , which appeared to be lightened by the sporadic finding of aMPV and IBV field strain co-infection in the last period of the productive cycle, whereas the paucity of aMPV positivity in the first part of the cycle would enforce the competitive role sustained by high IBV vaccine titers. The tendency to detect aMPV in presence of lower IBV vaccine titer ( Figure 5 ) seems to support a certain interference between the 2 viruses, potentially due to the reduction of the susceptible cell number or to the pre-activation of the innate immune response, which could hamper aMPV replication. aMPV field relevance appears more urgent nowadays, even though the clinical and productive impact of this pathogen is still partially neglected. Being this study focussed on IBV, no epidemiological conclusions can be drawn on aMPV; still, its wide presence in broilers should promote more accurate surveys.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 470, "end": 494, "text": "(Terregino et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 495, "end": 516, "text": "Sarueng et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 517, "end": 535, "text": "Awad et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 796, "end": 817, "text": "(Franzo et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1755, "text": "(Cavanagh et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1781, "text": "Cecchinato et al., 2013a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1894, "text": "(Cavanagh et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1913, "text": "Cook et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1939, "text": "Cecchinato et al., 2013a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2295, "end": 2303, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Moreover, further studies will be necessary to understand also if the apparent inverse relationship between IBV vaccine titer and aMPV infection is actually due to competition, to the vaccine kinetics itself, or to other unconsidered factors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The importance of a simple vaccine kinetics monitoring through real-time RT-PCR appears evident when the titer kinetics and vaccine persistence suggest different evaluations about the exerted protection.
