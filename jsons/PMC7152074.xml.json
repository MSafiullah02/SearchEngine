            "text": "For the detection of most viruses, it is important to obtain specimens soon after the onset of clinical symptoms (preferably within the first 3 to 4 days) when viral shedding is maximal. Optimal specimens vary depending on the site(s) of disease. In general, tissues, aspirates, and body fluids are superior to swabs. However, in many circumstances, swabs may be the only specimen available. Body sites or lesions that can be sampled easily with a swab include the pharynx or nasopharynx, conjunctiva, urethra, cervix, vagina, and vesicles or ulcers on the skin or mucous membranes. Many types of swabs are available for specimen collection, including plastic, wooden, or those with a flexible wire shaft and a tip made of cotton, Dacron, calcium alginate, or polyurethane.6 However, certain swabs may not be suitable for detection of some viruses. Swabs with a wooden shaft can contain toxic products that inactivate herpes simplex virus (HSV). Cotton-tipped swabs can contain fatty acids that can interfere with the survival of Chlamydia species, but are suitable for the collection of specimens from the vagina, cervix, or urethra for the detection of Mycoplasma. Calcium alginate-tipped swabs can be toxic for lipid-enveloped viruses such as herpesviruses and some cell cultures, but are useful for the collection of specimens for Chlamydia. Although swabs placed in viral transport media (VTM) can be used for NAATs, many commercial assays for detection of viruses and Chlamydia by antigen detection or molecular techniques provide their own swab and transport media, which should be used.",

However, many clinically relevant viruses, such as parvovirus, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis viruses, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), rotaviruses, noroviruses and others, are not cultivatable in the routine diagnostic laboratory; laboratory diagnosis is based on other methods. Although it is possible to cultivate HIV using suspension cultures of lymphocytes, special containment facilities are required; alternative methods are used for routine diagnosis. The major viruses detected by isolation in monolayer cell culture include HSV-1 and HSV-2, CMV, VZV, RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory adenoviruses, a number of enteroviruses (coxsackievirus, echovirus, poliovirus), and measles virus. Because not all cultivatable viruses replicate in a single cell line, several different cell lines are used for primary isolation. Examples are isolation diploid cell lines (e.g., human foreskin or lung fibroblasts for herpesviruses), primary cell lines such as primary rhesus monkey kidney cells for respiratory viruses and enteroviruses, and heteroploid or continuous human epithelial cell line such as Hep-2 cells for RSV. The types of cell lines used in the diagnostic laboratory are determined by the specimen type, season, epidemiologic data, and clinical information provided. Many viruses cause morphologic changes, i.e., cytopathic effect (CPE), in the cell monolayer. Some viruses cause CPE within 2 days (e.g., HSV), others within a week (e.g., enteroviruses), and others after several weeks (e.g., CMV). For viruses that do not cause typical CPE, detection can be based on the adsorption of red cells to the surface of virus-infected cells in culture (e.g., influenza and parainfluenza viruses) or by the use of interference assays (e.g., rubella virus). Presumptive identification of a particular virus or virus group in cell culture is based on the cell type, the characteristic time of onset, and the appearance of CPE, and is facilitated if the laboratory personnel are informed of the source of the specimen and the suspected clinical diagnosis.",

For slowly growing viruses such as CMV, the use of monoclonal antibody against nonstructural proteins produced early in the replication cycle (i.e., immediate early antigen or early antigen) allows detection of virus days to weeks before CPE can be observed by traditional cell culture techniques. Because of its speed, the shell vial method has replaced conventional cultures in many laboratories (Table 287-1\n) and is used routinely for the detection of CMV, HSV, VZV, respiratory viruses, and the enteroviruses.",

A baby hamster kidney cell line has been transformed using an HSV-inducible promoter (UL39 gene) and an E. coli \u03b2-galactosidase gene. The addition of a substrate for the \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme results in formation of a color reaction in the HSV-infected cells. This technique has been adapted for performing rapid HSV antiviral susceptibility testing. Mixing multiple cell types in a single shell vial culture can provide rapid detection of respiratory viruses (R-Mix), HSV, CMV and VZV (H and V Mix), and enteroviruses (E-Mix).",

Quantification of viral genome in plasma or serum can be used to determine prognosis, select patients for antiviral therapy, and monitor response to treatment in a variety of patient populations.34 Multiplex assays capable of detecting a number of viruses in a single amplification reaction have been developed, e.g., for herpesviruses, enteric, bloodborne, and respiratory viruses.39, 40, 41, 42 The development of automated real-time PCR using fluorescence techniques and continuous detection of amplified product has shortened detection times significantly relative to conventional PCR assays.43 Because these assays use a closed system (i.e., amplification and detection occur in a single tube that need not be opened once the reaction is completed), they also are less prone to contamination. NAAT has been applied to genotyping of viruses (e.g., HIV, HBV, and HCV) as well as for the detection of mutations that confer resistance to antiviral agents.34\n",

Interpretation of serologic results is virus-specific (e.g., the presence of HIV antibodies indicates current infection, whereas the presence of IgG anti-rubella indicates immunity as a result of immunization or recovery from natural infection). Serologic diagnosis of acute infection is more useful when the incubation period is prolonged (e.g., 3 to 6 weeks) and antibody is present in serum concomitantly with signs of illness (e.g., EBV and CMV mononucleosis). Figure 287-1\nshows a typical antibody response for an acute, moderate-incubation (several days to 2 weeks) viral illness such as measles. At the onset of rash or other manifestations, antibody is undetectable or is present at low titer. Within 10 to 14 days, appreciable titers of antibody are present. For short-incubation virus infections (e.g., respiratory viruses), a rise in antibody usually does not occur until the late recovery phase or during convalescence and has no value for acute diagnosis. With the use of older serologic methods such as hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and complement fixation (CF) that detect IgG antibody, a >4-fold rise in titer based on serial dilution endpoints between acute and convalescent sera tested in parallel confirms a diagnosis. A 4-fold fall in titer also is presumptive evidence of a recent infection whereas unchanging low titers indicate past infection and immunity. The presence of antibody in high titer in a single serum specimen during convalescence usually does not permit a definitive diagnosis. Acute seroconversion also can be used to diagnose an acute or recent infection.",

However, because of variability among commercial as well as in-house quantitative CMV assays, the exact level of CMV DNA or antigenemia that should be used to initiate pre-emptive therapy is not well established. Potential problems with these assays include inhibition of PCR when heparin is used as the anticoagulant,12 false-negative findings with the CMV antigenemia assay when processing of blood samples is delayed beyond 4 to 6 hours,95 cost, the need for technical expertise, and labor intensity (e.g., CMV antigenemia).

False-negative results can occur if samples are collected late in the course of the illness. IgG anti-VC is elevated during symptoms of illness and can persist for life, and thus is less useful for the diagnosis of acute infection but remains the most reliable marker of EBV seropositivity. IgG anti-early antigen (EA) rises early, whereas IgG anti-EBNA (Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen) appears late (generally after 6 weeks) and persists for life.

            "text": "Routine diagnosis for all hepatitis viruses is based on serology. Serum or plasma can be used for most assays and should be separated from blood within 24 hours of collection. The diagnosis of acute HAV is made by demonstration of IgM anti-HAV.162 Immunity to HAV following natural infection or immunization is determined by measuring hepatitis A IgG or total (IgG and IgM) anti-HAV.162 Currently, there is no role for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR measurement of HAV RNA for routine diagnosis. In acute and chronic HBV infection both HBsAg and anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) usually are present.163 IgM anti-HBc generally is present in acute HBV infection and occasionally during a flare of inflammation in chronic carriers. Thus, IgM anti-HBc does not always distinguish acute from chronic infection. By definition, a person with persistently positive HBsAg for >6 months is considered chronically infected. Isolated anti-HBc positivity can occur during: (1) acute infection between the loss of detectable HBsAg and emergence of detectable HBsAb (\u201ccore window\u201d); (2) late chronic infection when HBsAg levels have fallen below detectable levels; (3) coinfection with HCV or HIV that suppress HBsAg production; (4) infection with a mutant HBV; or (5) a false-positive result. The role of quantitative HBsAg assays is being evaluated for monitoring patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. The presence of HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and the absence of anti-HBe are markers of greater infectivity and correlate with increased risk of progression to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.163 The presence of anti-HBe is an indicator of likely recovery. The presence of HBsAb at a level >10 IU/mL is considered to protective against acute infection. HBsAb levels can decline below 10 IU/mL after 10 to 12 years in a substantial number of vaccine responders. These individuals remain protected from acute infection likely as a result of immune memory.164 The presence of HBsAb alone reflects prior immunization whereas the presence of HBsAb together with HBcAb reflects recovery from previous natural infection.163\n",

The use of NAATs in populations who are not known to be HIV-seropositive has yielded false-positive results.191 The major use of quantitative HIV-1 viral load assays is for monitoring a patient's response to antiretroviral therapy.28, 192 Because of the intra-assay and biologic variability in HIV-1 RNA levels, a >3-fold change is considered clinically relevant. Different molecular assays also can produce significant differences in HIV-1 viral load and thus baseline values should be repeated when the laboratory testing is changed from one assay to another.192 Some assays yield lower levels in the same patient if serum is used instead of plasma or if blood is collected in acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulant rather than EDTA. Currently available commercial assays vary in specimen volume requirement (range from 50 \u00b5L to 2 mL), lower limit of detection, dynamic range, and time to result.192 Regardless of assay format, plasma must be separated from the blood cells within 6 hours of collection.

The sensitivity of IgM anti-parvovirus exceeds 90% in the first month after the onset of symptoms. IgG antibodies appear within several days after IgM and generally persist for years. Current IgG assays have a sensitivity of >90%; IgG indicates past infection. Re-exposure to parvovirus leads to a rise in IgG antibody levels. IgG avidity assays can help distinguish primary from secondary infections.215 Immunocompromised individuals may not produce antibody; diagnosis can be made by NAAT detection of viral DNA in serum or other specimen types. Parvovirus-associated aplastic crisis, chronic infection, and congenital infection can be diagnosed by PCR analysis of serum.214, 215, 216 PCR also can be used to detect parvovirus B19 DNA in bone marrow aspirates, cord blood samples, amniotic fluid cells, and biopsy specimens of the placenta and fetal tissues in cases of fetal hydrops. However, parvovirus DNA may be detectable in serum for months after acute infection and for years in other tissues.217 Thus the diagnosis of acute or chronic parvovirus infection may require both serology and quantitative PCR.",

A positive EIA usually requires validation by a second nonculture method, especially in low-prevalence populations.227 Point-of-care EIAs can provide a result in <30 minutes but their performance is poor and evidence regarding their impact on clinical outcomes is lacking.236, 237, 238 DFA assays using monoclonal antibodies directed against the major outer-membrane protein (MOMP) permit direct visualization of the cellular material obtained (as an assessment of the quality of the specimen) and both elementary bodies and intracellular inclusions can be detected within 30 minutes. However, DFA testing requires a skilled laboratory microscopist, and large numbers of specimens cannot be processed expediently.239, 240, 241 DFA has been used for conjunctival and respiratory specimens from infants. Nucleic acid probes are similar in sensitivity to other antigen detection methods and are relatively specific. However, DNA probe tests (without previous amplification) require special transport media, thus precluding the use of another test on the same specimen to confirm a positive result. DNA probe tests have a sensitivity for male genital secretions inferior to that of other methods. Cytologic examination of direct smears for the presence of intracellular inclusions is useful for detection of chlamydial conjunctivitis in neonates, but not for diagnosing conjunctivitis or genital infection in adolescents.223\n",
