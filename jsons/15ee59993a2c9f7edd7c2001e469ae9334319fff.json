The sequencing was carried out by the Child Health Research Foundation and provided the first insight into the genetic details of the viral strain responsible for the SARS-CoV-2 infections in Bangladesh. Here we carried out a comparative study were we explored the phylogenetic relationship between the Bangladeshi isolate with other isolates from different parts of the world. Afterwards we identified single nucleotide variants in the Bangladeshi isolate, using the Wuhan virus reference sequence. We found a total of 9 variants in the Bangladeshi isolate using 2 separate tools. Barring 2, the rest of these variants were also observed in other isolates from different countries. Most of the variants occurred in the ORF1ab gen. Another noteworthy finding was a sequence of three consecutive variants in the N protein gene that were observed in other isolates as well. Lastly the phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between the Bangladeshi isolate and those from Taiwan,",

The virus which primarily infects the respiratory tract, has spread to almost every country in the world. It has infected over 4 million individuals worldwide and led to the deaths of over 283,000 [1] . A considerable body of research on the virus has already accumulated. Its genome has been sequenced in many different parts of the world. In addition, a lot of effort has already gone into identifying genetic variants. Several studies have analysed and speculated on the genetic variability of the virus and whether or not this gives it a survival advantage [2, 3, 4, 5] . Recently, the first Bangladeshi isolate of the virus has been sequenced and its data made publicly available (EPI_ISL_437912). The virus was first reported in the country last March. Since then, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections have risen steadily, currently standing at over 17,800 infected and 269 dead [6] .",

This is to be expected as that is the largest gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, spanning over half its genome length. It also contained the previously discussed 3 variants in the N protein gene and 1 variant in the S protein gene. The latter, an A to G mutation at position 23403, has already been implicated in a number of previous studies. Previously it was believed this particular mutation is common the viral strains in Europe [12] . Although out analysis did show that isolates from other Asian countries (India, Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Israel), in addition to the Bangladeshi one, also contained this particular variant.

One contains the Italian, South Korean and Australian isolates, another consists of the Indian (Maharashtra) and American (Washington) isolates and a third one that later gives rise to two more clusters. The first of these two clusters contains the isolates from Arizona and Michigan, while the second includes the Bangladeshi isolate. This observation that the Arizona and Michigan isolates and the Bangladesh isolate arise from the same divergence event and the fact that the two American isolates appear to be predate the Bangladeshi one, would seem to suggest that the virus first arrived in Bangladesh from USA.",

And the percentage of fatalities among infected patients is current a little over 1% for Israel; comparable with the Bangladeshi fatality percentage and considerably lower than the global. This invites the possibility of this, the three consecutive variants, possibly being a characteristic feature of a weaker strain of the virus. Again, the evidence right now is purely correlational. But this does still remain as another interesting future avenue to explore.",

In addition we believe that the most likely route the virus used to get to Bangladesh was via either Michigan or Arizona in the USA. Sri Lanka also remains an outside possibility, but we believe the more likely scenario is that Sri Lanka and Bangladesh got the virus from the source, and that it arrived in Sri Lanka earlier than Bangladesh. Future studies should be putting more focus on how these variants impact the protein functions of the virus, so as to shed better light on how the pathogen is changing and what it means for our fight to bring the pandemic to an end.",

This was located in the N protein gene of the virus. It is a gene known to play a critical role in virion assembly and structure. 8 of the isolates contained this tri-nucleotide change (Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, California, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, Sri Lanka and Israel). The other isolates did not contain variants at any of these three positions.

The Sri Lankan isolate occupied the shortest branch in this cluster, possibly suggesting that it predates the Bangladeshi, Taiwanese, Greek and Kazakh isolates. Interestingly, the South African isolate, which shared almost complete sequence identity with the Bangladeshi isolate, appeared to predate it. This would indicate that perhaps the virus may have reached South Africa before Bangladesh. The Sri Lankan isolate makes for some interesting interpretation. Its shorter branch length points towards an earlier origin compared to the Bangladeshi virus. But the near 100% sequence identity would suggest otherwise. A plausible explanation may be that the virus both these countries from the source (most likely Michigan or Arizona), but it reached Sri Lanka before Bangladesh.As for the SNPs, on average each isolate contained 6 SNPs. The Bangladeshi virus somewhat bucked the trend, containing 9 SNPs, tying with the Californian, Spanish and Greek viral genomes for the second highest among all the isolates analysed. The Kazakh viral genome had the highest number of variants at 10. The intriguing point to note here is that Kazakhstan and Greece have had comparatively fewer cases of infections (5207 and 2726 respectively).Spain and California have of course been much worse hit, but there we have to entertain the possibility of more than viral strain being active in those regions. The reason for that being both the Californian and Spanish isolate genomes we analysed were closely situated with the Bangladeshi isolate in the phylogeny. Given these countries reported their first infections much earlier than Bangladesh, it would seem unlikely that their viral isolates would appear to arise so late in the evolutionary course taken by this virus. This is backed up by the fact that this specific Spanish isolate genome was submitted on 17 th April and the Californian isolate genome on 23 rd April. It seems more likely that there may be multiple strains active in",
