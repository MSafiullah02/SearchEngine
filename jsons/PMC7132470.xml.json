In a short period of time, new SARS cases spread around the world, information on the epidemic flooded the news, and healthcare organizations were faced with a new challenge. The disease was contagious, relatively fatal and thought to be contracted by droplet contamination. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were also infected and died from the disease. In Israel, there were a number of suspected SARS cases, but none were confirmed after testing. Due to the uncertainty and fear associated with the new phenomenon and the lack of guidelines or a clear policy, the initial steps taken to cope with SARS required fast clinical and administrative decisions. Decision-making in a time of emergency is associated with a high potential for ethical dilemmas and conflicts.",

In China, for example, a new hospital was dedicated solely to the treatment of SARS patients. In Israel, incoming passengers from SARS-infected areas had their temperature measured in the airport, nurses screened travellers for suspicious symptoms, and aeroplanes were cleaned scrupulously.

Had there been such involvement, it is uncertain whether our decisions would have been different or whether the decision-making process would have been more complex. We recommend the immediate availability of legal and ethical consultants in the field whose input could be utilised in times of stress by supporting the clinical staff in coping with ethical dilemmas.
