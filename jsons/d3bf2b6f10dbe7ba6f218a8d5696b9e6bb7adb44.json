Design: With a priori information obtained from the daily number of deaths due to CODIV-19 in China and data from the Peruvian authorities, we constructed a predictive Bayesian non-linear model for the number of deaths in Peru. Exposure: COVID-19. Outcome: Number of deaths. Results: Assuming an intervention level similar to the one implemented in China, the total number of deaths in Peru is expected to be 612 (95%CI: 604.3 -833.7) persons. Sixty four days after the first reported death, the 99% of expected deaths will be observed. The inflexion point in the number of deaths is estimated to be around day 26 (95%CI: 25.1 -26.8) after the first reported death.",

This approach is however very sensitive to starting assumptions and tend to overestimated the virus reproductive rate. One key point that these models miss is the individual behavioral responses and government-mandated policies that can dramatically influence the course of the epidemic. In Wuhan, for instance, strict social distancing was instituted on January 23rd, 2020, and by March 15th new infections were close to zero. Taking into account this observation, COVID et al. (2020) have proposed a statistical approach to model a empirical cumulative population death rate. However, modelling observed cumulative death numbers has the inherent problem of yielding a highly correlated data which, if it is not taken into account, could cause misleading inference results.",

The choice of the Skew Normal distribution is motivated by its flexibility on the tails and their asymmetry, which can force, as one could expect, a rapidly increase rate at the first stages of the pandemic and a slower decrease of this rate at the last stages. A negative binomial distribution can also be considered for the deaths numbers, but we found empirically a better fit with the Poisson model.",

While these authors incorporated first the Chinese data-more concretely the time from when the initial death rate exceeds 1e-15 to the implementation of social distancing-into their model throughout a location-specific inflection point parameter or a maximum death rate and then used a sort of credibility model between short-range and long-rate variants, we followed a Bayesian approach that incorporates the Chinese data as a prior distribution.

Figure 2 shows the observed and predicted death rates (A) and the daily number of deaths (B) in China. The predicted rates and their associated 95% prediction credible intervals were obtained, under a Bayesian approach, by considering a non-informative prior and the Chinese official death reports.
