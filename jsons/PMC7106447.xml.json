Between February 25, 2003, when the first SARS patient returned to Taiwan from China, and April 21, 2003, when a large-scale nosocomial infection was recognised, 30 probable and 50 suspected SARS cases were reported. All were visitors who had returned from various parts of China via Hong Kong (figure\n). During this phase, all reported SARS patients regardless of whether they were considered to be suspected or probable (according to the criteria recommended by WHO) cases, were all hospitalised in negative-pressure isolation rooms, which had been established mainly for patients with tuberculosis. By the end of April, the major SARS epidemics in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada had plateaued, and the medical community in Taiwan became complacent since each imported SARS case was quickly identified, and secondary transmission was successfully blocked. Consequently, an unidentified SARS patient who had no travel history abroad, was not diagnosed promptly and that, coupled with a lapse in hospital infection-control practices, triggered a large-scale nosocomial SARS transmission in a municipal hospital in Taipei; this was followed by a series of nosocomial infections in seven hospitals due to the interhospital movement of unrecognised SARS patients. This chain of transmission from one hospital to another was subsequently confirmed by a genome analysis of the viruses, which verified the epidemiological link between outbreaks in all seven hospitals.13 In the end, 80% of the confirmed 346 SARS patients in Taiwan were acquired in a hospital, and 30% (n=102) of them were health-care workers. The scenario of nosocomial infection affecting both patient and health-care workers was similar in other countries,14 and highlights the potential threat that noscocomial infections have in debilitating an entire health-care system.",

During the SARS outbreak, passengers with fevers were prohibited from boarding the aeroplane. A hospital near each airport was designated to house, diagnose, and treat any passengers found with fever at the airport. Interestingly, in the summer through fall of 2003, 15 cases of imported dengue and/or malaria were identified at the airports. In part, it is believed that such a fever screening system would serve to deter SARS patients from international travel, and could reduce the international spread of SARS. However, due to the difference in the timing of infectivity in relation to the time of symptom onset (figure 3\n), how well this screening device can prevent international spread of infections other than SARS remains to be evaluated.",

The intensified efforts to identify aetiological agents for respiratory diseases have put these laboratories in a well-prepared state to detect the avian influenza virus when it occurs in human beings. In fact, early detection of any avian influenza virus in human beings is believed to be the key to influenza pandemic prevention and has been the main focus of concern for clinical laboratories in Taiwan.",

These measures are implemented to avoid testing a large number of clinical samples using the currently available nucleic acid-based reverse transcriptase-PCR method, because the small percentage of false-positives associated with this method would involve unnecessary public-health measures that would incur a heavy workload on hospital personnel, and possibly social panic.",

In the case of influenza A infection, however, the infectivity may precede the onset of illness. Thus, in the event of pandemic influenza, quarantine would not be an effective control measure. Rather, the preparation for the influenza pandemic is now focusing on stockpiling of effective antiviral drugs as well as the strengthening of the influenza vaccination programme.

The SARS coronavirus isolated from the first of these four patients revealed a high homology with the SARS-like virus that had been isolated from the animals.25 The obscure source of the SARS coronavirus infection for these SARS patients suggests the possible persistence of SARS coronavirus in animal reservoirs in southern China. In January 2004, the Chinese authority banned all trading of palm civets in the market in Guangdong (NS Zhong, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, China, personal communication). Whether the lack of further SARS cases is a result of the ban on palm civets remains to be seen.

Taiwan is therefore confronted with the possible importation of SARS cases on a daily basis. As a result, the level for SARS alert was upgraded on January 1, 2004 to level A, which indicates the presence of confirmed SARS cases in other countries.26 Taiwan CDC kicked off several prevention measures, including intensifying fever surveillance of all travellers arriving from China, and expediting laboratory diagnosis of SARS coronavirus among testing for patients who recently had arrived from China and Hong Kong. In addition, stowaways from China, if caught in Taiwan are quarantined for 10 days before being sent home. Moreover, all employers are asked to provide assistance in conducting fever surveillance of their employees who travel to and from China or Hong Kong. The SARS alert was downgraded on February 25, 2004 when it was certain that no secondary transmission had occurred in Guangdong.",

It should be reiterated that prevention measures will have to be adjusted to account for the similarities and differences between SARS and influenza. Both SARS and pandemic influenza are likely to be zoonotic in nature, and establishing the capability for early detection in initial human cases is the key to preventing large-scale human transmission. While both diseases carry a considerable surge potential in terms of the number of patients and health-care workers potentially affected, antiviral drugs that can be used for prophylaxis are available to fight influenza. However, the demand for the antiviral may be high and will require countries to stock adequate supplies in advance. If transmission begins in human beings at any focal point, the speed at which influenza spreads will depend on how early it is detected, and how fast the international community can mobilise and deliver assistance, including providing antiviral drugs for prophylactic use. Therefore, in addition to a national preparedness plan, Taiwan scientists and government officials are also actively seeking international collaborations with neighbouring countries in Asia, since Taiwan is, hitherto, usually barred from activities coordinated by WHO.",
