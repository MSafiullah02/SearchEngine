            "text": "\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia worldwide [1]. Bacteraemia secondary to pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common presentation of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and is associated with high mortality rates, particularly in elderly populations [2\u20137]. Mortality rates are highest during the first days of admission [8, 9]. During this critical period, precise diagnostic evaluation, combination antibiotic therapy [10, 11], adjunctive treatments [12] and early admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [13] may all reduce inpatient mortality from IPD. The accurate identification of individual patients who could benefit from these interventions remains inexact and challenging. Prognostic scoring systems [such as the pneumonia severity index (PSI) [14] and the confusion, elevated blood urea nitrogen level, respiratory rate and blood pressure plus age \u226565 years (CURB 65 score) [15]] stratify patients in large cohorts according to mortality risk in order to identify those who can be safely managed in an outpatient setting. However, both of these clinical scores and consensus guidelines do not reliably identify individual patients requiring ICU escalation [13, 16\u201319]. In contrast, there are increasing data that correlate pneumococcal bacterial load measured by molecular assays with clinical outcome [20, 21]: detection of high bacterial load has specificity exceeding 80 % for septic shock and mechanical ventilation [21\u201323]. Thus, besides diagnostic utility in organism identification, the quantification of bacterial load may be useful in stratifying individuals with IPD to determine the site and intensity of inpatient care [13, 24]. DNA assays have increasing sensitivity and utility in the diagnosis of IPD in patients with negative blood cultures [21, 25]. However, DNA assays do have limitations: they may be only 60\u201385 % sensitive in patients with positive blood cultures, do not routinely yield antibiotic sensitivity data and require potentially expensive specialist facilities and expertise [21, 23]. Culture of viable pathogens from the bloodstream is intrinsically superior to the detection of pathogenic DNA and remains fundamental to the initial diagnostic work-up for sepsis [26]. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of bacterial load to clinical outcome for patients with invasive pneumococcal pneumonia by using an affordable and sensitive method in a routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory.",

The computer generates growth curves based on plots of fluorescence units (FU) recorded every 10 min versus time. By analysing the generated growth curves, we have learned that, at approximately 50 to 60 min prior to the detection time, the FU start to increase (the log phase) after a period of unchanging values (the lag phase). The shape of the growth curve from the end of the lag phase to the time to detection (TTD) satisfies the following differential equation:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{luorescence}\\ \\mathbf{rate}\\left(\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{R}\\right)=\\varDelta \\mathbf{F}/\\varDelta \\mathbf{T} $$\\end{document}FluorescencerateFR=\u0394F/\u0394Twhere \u0394F is the difference in the fluorescence readings between that at the end of the lag phase (F0) and that at the TTD (Fx), and \u0394T is the difference in time between that at the end of the lag phase (t0) and that at the TTD (tx).

Our extrapolated analysis of existing culture techniques is cheap, widely available and can be integrated into the automated process of the BACTEC blood culture analyser. The software required to optimise the BACTEC system adds negligible cost and an FR report can be generated instantaneously. Manual calculation of the FR, without additional software, takes less than 5 min. Our innovative approach may have a role in other invasive pneumococcal infections, such as meningitis, but also in sepsis caused by different organisms, where objective and early assessment of disease severity could improve clinical outcome. In time, a specific FR threshold for different organisms may provide a single value that accurately prognosticates sepsis outcomes.",

Bacterial load based on blood culture inoculation, and, consequently, the FR, is directly affected by preceding antibiotic administration. As far as possible in our study, we have excluded patients receiving antibiotic therapy prior to blood culture collection. However, owing to individual variation in the documentation of clinical notes, we cannot definitively report that all patients did not receive oral antibiotic preparations prior to hospital admission. In contrast, the sensitivity of DNA assays does not significantly change over days after antibiotic administration [23]. Six patients out of the ten patients who died due to invasive pneumococcal pneumonia were intentionally not escalated to intensive care or to intubation as part of the clinical plan. It may be the case that death may be preventable in patients where escalation is clinically appropriate. However, we acknowledge that this may have a compromising effect on the correlation of the FR to mortality. Alternatively, there may be unrecognised clinical or non-clinical parameters, not identified by our linear regression analyses, which predispose to the high mortality in this specific group of patients. However, the survival and non-survival groups demonstrated no statistically significant variation in the demographic or clinical profiles. With the two groups matched in this way, it suggests that the FR remains a prognostic tool of high utility. Similarly, while delays in presentation to hospital might also predict poor prognosis, owing to the untreated complications of sepsis, we could not accurately capture these data from the clinical notes audit. However, at presentation, the bacterial load and FR will also increase with prolonged and uninhibited bacterial growth. Thus, these analyses will still likely provide a clinically useful snapshot of disease severity at the time of blood culture sampling.",
