The results of docking to both HCV and HCoV suggest that both H-bonds and metal interactions strongly contribute to the binding of nucleotide inhibitors to the polymerase active site and hence protein inhibition. For MERS CoV models, IDX-184 yields better docking scores compared to Ribavirin. It would be suggested to lunch an experimental study on the potency of IDX-184 on MERS CoV. A number of possible modifications and optimizations to the lead compound (IDX-184) may be useful for further increasing the potency of the drug against MERS CoV polymerase. 5 | AUTHORS' CONTRIBUTION AAE suggested the research plan, wrote the manuscript and constructed tables and figures.

The docking scores are \u221281.1, \u221279.8, and \u221256.5 Kcal/mol, respectively.

Metal interactions are reported for R7128 and Ribavirin only. The formation of H-bonds (in both cases of HCV and MERS CoV)provides stability to the protein/ligand complex and hence inhibiting viral polymerase function, since the polymerase active site will not be free to bind to the nucleotides for the polymerization process to be completed. The gray smudges in Figs. 4 and S1 indicate water exposed atoms or groups. Some OH and NH 2 groups are water exposed and hence formation of water-ligand interactions in the active site vicinity may occur and consequently adds to the stabilization of the protein/ ligand complex. This may be proved by studying the dynamics ofbinding. 43 The same manner of interactions occurs in other HCoV strains and the amino acids that are involved in the formation of H-bonds with ligands are Lys40, Lys46, Arg48, Arg50, Thr51, Asp113, Tyr114, Lys116, Ser177, Asn186, Tyr223, Tyr227, Ser245, Asp255, and Gly257. These amino acids comprise the active site pocket of the polymerase. The repeated amino acids that form H-bonds in different strains of the virus are Arg48, Arg50, Lys116, Tyr227, and Asp255. Based on the above data from both QSAR and molecular docking one can conclude that anti-HCV polymerase drugs could be effective potent inhibitors against HCoV polymerases including the most recent outbreak of MERS CoV. This inhibition takes place through the formation of H-bonds between the nucleotide inhibitors and the protein conserved active site pocket amino acids, the metal interactions and other interactions that strengthen the binding of the drugs to the protein active site. It would be useful to further examine the binding through molecular dynamics simulations.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT Dr Wael A.
