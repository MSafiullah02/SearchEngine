Patients are screened by telephone for: complaints of fever or upper respiratory symptoms; residence in one of the hot zones; contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Patients who fulfill any of these criteria and require urgent ophthalmology visits are redirected to a separate room. Otherwise, patients are contacted again after 14 days.Patients with non-deferrable conditions are contacted by physicians by phone 2 days before the scheduled visit to recognize cases of reduced visual acuity or increase/appearance of other visual symptoms such as metamorphopsia and photopsia. In case of stable ocular conditions, a novel phone contact is scheduled and the visit is postponed. For patients with urgent conditions, a visit is scheduled. Only one accompanying person is allowed, who is denied access to the visiting room, except in exceptional cases. In addition, students and fellows are not allowed to attend the clinic. The interval time between appointments is increased to avoid too many patients being in the waiting room at one time. Trained and well-equipped personnel are dedicated to the first triage of the selected patients to exclude any symptoms related to a possible infection and invite them to wash their hands and wear surgical masks.",
