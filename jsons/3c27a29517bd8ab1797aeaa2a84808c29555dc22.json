The cellular localization of recombinantly expressed CCHFV glycoproteins was compared to authentic glycoproteins expressed during virus infection using indirect immunofluorescence assays, subcellular fractionation/western blot assays and confocal microscopy. To further elucidate potential intracellular targeting/retention signals of the two glycoproteins, GFP-fusion proteins containing different parts of the CCHFV glycoprotein were analyzed for their intracellular targeting. The N-terminal glycoprotein G N localized to the Golgi complex, a process mediated by retention/targeting signal(s) in the cytoplasmic domain and ectodomain of this protein. In contrast, the C-terminal glycoprotein G C remained in the endoplasmic reticulum but could be rescued into the Golgi complex by co-expression of G N .",

Only three viruses are known to cause disease: CCHFV, Dugbe virus, and Nairobi sheep disease virus. CCHFV is an arthropodborne pathogen and the causative agent of a serious form of hemorrhagic fever [7] [8] [9] with mortality rates ranging from 15 to 60% [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The virus is endemic in parts of Africa, Southeastern Europe and Asia as far east as western China [16, 18, 19] . The geographic distribution of CCHFV infections corresponds most closely with the distribution of Hyalomma ticks, suggesting their principal vector role [18, 20, 21] . Hyalomma ticks normally feed on a variety of livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, and ostriches), large wild herbivores, hares, and hedgehogs, which can become infected with CCHFV [13, 18, 22, 23] . In contrast to human infections, infection in these animals generally results in inapparent or subclinical disease but generates viremia levels capable of supporting virus transmission to uninfected ticks [10, 18, 21, [23] [24] [25] . Transmission to humans occurs either by bites from infected ticks or direct contact with blood or tissues of infected livestock. Nosocomial infections are common [26] and represent a major problem in health care institutions [27] .",

Since the C-terminus of CCHFV G N has not yet been determined ( [28] ; S. Nichol: pers. communication) two constructs were generated containing an N-terminal Influenza HA-tag for detection: pCMV CCHF G N \"short\" (G N s) and pCMV CCHF G N \"long\" (G N l). Glycoprotein expression was first analyzed by immunoblot using CCHFV-specific polyclonal or HAtag antibodies. The CCHF full-length glycoprotein precursor construct (pCAGGS CCHFV GPC) was successfully expressed and correctly processed into the cleavage fragments G C and G N (Fig. 2, lane 2) . Molecular weights (G C , 37 kDa and G N , 75 kDa) as determined by immunoblot analysis were in accordance with those of the G C and G N . The data demonstrates that each glycoprotein can be authentically expressed individually from separate plasmids (e.g., pCMV G N s, pCMV G N l and pCAGGS G C ) as well as from a clone encoding the GPC precursor (pCAGGS GPC) using polyclonal CCHFV-specific and HA-tag antibodies (Fig. 2 ).

Subsequently, we analyzed the intracellular localization of individually expressed GN and GC. Whereas individually expressed GN showed a Golgi complex localization ( Fig. 3A : b, c, g, h), individually expressed GC accumulated in the perinuclear region of the cell indicative of ER localization ( Fig.  3A : a, f). Confirmation for these results were achieved by co-immunofluorescence analyzed on a confocal microscope using CCHFV glycoprotein-specific or HA-specific antibodies and either antibodies directed against the ERspecific marker molecule calreticulin or direct staining of the Golgi region with BODIPY-TR C5 ceramides (Fig. 4) . Again, CCHFV GN expression from the two expression plasmids pCMV GNs and pCMV GNl overlapped with Golgi staining ( Fig. 4 : e, f), whereas GC expression overlapped with that of calreticulin ( Fig. 4 : d). However, coexpression of both CCHFV glycoproteins either from the glycoprotein precursor plasmid or from simultaneous transfection of the two expression plasmids resulted in Golgi targeting of both glycoproteins ( Fig. 4 : c, g) strongly indicating that GN drives the Golgi localization and that GC needs to interact with GN in order to be transported out of the ER.",

However, so far no common motifs could be identified for signals within bunyaviral glycoproteins resulting in Golgi targeting and accumulation. Indeed, even the locations of such signals within bunyaviral glycoproteins are different. For the phlebovirus Uukuniemi (UUK), a Golgi retention signal could be identified within the membrane-proximal half (aa1040) of the 81 aa long cytoplasmic domain of G N [30, 31, 38] . In contrast, for the phlebovirus Punto Toro, such signals were mapped to the transmembrane domain (TM) and the adjacent amino acids of the G N cytoplasmic domain [36, 37] . A similar localization was recently described for the Golgi retention signal in the G N of the phlebovirus Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus G N [34] . Notable, for the Old World hantavirus Hantaan (HTN) it was reported that the conformation of the G N /G C complex might play a more important role for Golgi accumulation than an actual primary sequence motif [39] .",

Here we demonstrated, for the first time, that the CCHFV G N protein is membrane associated and contains a Golgi localization motif. In addition we have mapped this signal to a hydrophobic region (TM II) within the predicted cytoplasmic tail [5] . Co-expressed GN and GC result in a specific Golgi accumulation and co-localization using specific Golgi markers, whereas individual expressed GC is retained in the ER. These results imply that the two CCHFV glycoproteins have to interact and form heterooligomers for a proper Golgi transport of G C .",

Furthermore, we could demonstrate that the addition of only the hydrophobic region from the predicted TM II within the G N cytoplasmic domain targeted a GFPfusion protein to the Golgi complex.

IFA data combined with confocal microscopy colocalization studies of cells transfected with G N s expression plasmids demonstrated a clear Golgi complex staining ( Fig. 3A: b, g; Fig. 4e ). Since G N s contains only the first 87 amino acids of the predicted cytoplasmic domain without the predicted TM II sequence, we expected that the corresponding GFP-fusion protein GFP-G N A would show similar intracellular localization. However, the diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm of transfected cells demonstrates that the first 87 amino acids are not sufficient to target the GFP to the Golgi complex (GFP-G N A; Figs. 6B and 6C: c). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the existence of a second Golgi localization signal located within the G N ectodomain. Such a signal would be the reason for the Golgi localization pattern of G N s, whereas GFP-G N C and fusion proteins containing longer fragments of the predicted G N cytoplasmic domain localize to the Golgi region because of a Golgi localization signal located in TM II.",

            "text": "Total RNA was isolated 7 days post infection from VeroE6 cells infected with CCHFV (1:1000 dilution of virus stock; 10 -3 pfu, RNA sample #1). Additional CCHFV RNA was kindly provided by J. Smith, USAMRIID, Alphavax, Durham, N.C. (RNA sample #2). CCHFV specific M segment vRNA or cRNA molecules were reverse transcribed using the primers CCHF M1 (TCTCAAAGAAATAGTGGCGGCACGCAGTC) or CCHF M2 (TCTCAAAGAAATACTTGCGGCACGTCAGT) for the reverse transcription reaction, respectively. The resulting cDNA molecules were used as templates for subsequent PCR reactions producing overlapping PCR fragments covering the entire CCHFV M segment. PCR products were inserted into pCR4 using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Prior to sequence determination, positive clones were screened by PCR technology (primer TOPO F: AGCTCGGATCCACTAGTAACG and TOPO R: ATGCTCGAGCGGCCGCCAGTG) and restriction enzyme digest (EcoRI). For vRNA and cRNA-based constructs three of the cloning plasmids were sequenced using primers specific for the M segment ORF. The sequence results were aligned to the genebank sequence U39455 using the Align Plus 5 program of the Clone Manager Professional Suite 6 (Scientific & Educational Software). Determined nucleotide exchanges and the corresponding amino acid differences are listed in Table 1 . For sequence determination of the M segment ends CCHFV specific vRNA and cRNA molecules were ligated using T4 RNA ligase (Roche) prior to the reverse transcription reaction (vRNA: M32: AGAAC-CAGAGGCCTGTTCAA, cRNA: M33: AAGGTGTCTGTGCCGGTTGT). Subsequent PCR amplification with primers CCHF M34 (AATACTAGTCTAAT CCACTGGCTGGTGTT) and M35 (AATGAATTCT-GCCGAACTGTTCTCTAC) generated fragments containing both segment ends. PCR products were inserted into pCR4 (Invitrogen) for direct sequence determination as described above. In total, 12 cRNA/mRNA and 37 vRNA clones were analyzed using T7 and T3 promoter-specific primers.",

In case of the CCHFV G N two constructs were generated since the C terminus of the mature GN is not yet experimentally determined: pCMV CCHF G N \"short\" (G N s) contains the G N -ORF from pos. 519 to 807, preceding the predicted C-terminal cleavage site RKLL at position 808 (44) . pCMV CCHF G N \"long\" (G N l) consists of pos. 519 to 1040 extending the G N -ORF to the experimentally determined N-terminal end of GC. The PCR fragments (G N s: RF346/352, G N l: RF353/352) were inserted after BsmBI endonuclease treatment into pDisplay (Invitrogen) previously digested with BglII/XmaI digest, resulting in CMV-driven (human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter and enhancer) expression plasmids for CCHFV G N . The Ig \u03ba-chain signal peptide sequence and the hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope of the pDisplay vector were used for correct intracellular processing and detection, respectively. The CCHFV G C was PCR-amplified using primers CCHF M9 (AGTTGGTCTAGCCAATGT-GTG) and RF351 (AATCGTCTCAAATTCATGGAGAC AGACACACTCCTGCTATGGGTACTGCTGCTCTGGGTTC CAGGTTCCACTGGTGACTTCCTAGATAGTA-CAGCTAAAGGCATG) (pos. 1041 to 1684).",

At 24 to 48 h post transfection, supernatant was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS followed by an additional washing step with 100 ml NaCl. Occasionally, the transfected cells would detach from the plate thus, the non-adherent cells were isolated between washes by microcentrifugation (2 min at 1000 \u00d7 g). Remaining cells were scraped (adherent) or resuspended (non-adherent) into 1 ml of ice-cold 100 mM sodium carbonate, pH 11.5 and homogenized (five strokes) in a 2 ml Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was then incubated for 30 min on ice and 1 ml of sodium carbonate was added to attain the necessary volume for subsequent ultracentrifugation (2 ml). The homogenate was then centrifuged for 60 min at 50.000 rpm using a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman) at 4\u00b0C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and concentrated three to five times. The pellet was resuspended in 250 \u00b5l of sodium carbonate. Pellet and supernatant fractions were then mixed with 4\u00d7 SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and run on SDS-PAGE.

Twenty-four hours later cells were fixed with methanol/acetone. A subsequent indirect immunofluorescence using the Golgi compartment marker mannosidase II was performed and analyzed via UV microscopy. The merged picture clearly demonstrates the Golgi localization of the fusion protein.Subcellular fractionation studies of expressed GFP-CCHFV G fusion proteinsFigure 8Subcellular fractionation studies of expressed GFP-CCHFV G fusion proteins. Expression plasmids for GFP-CCHFV glycoprotein fusion protein were transfected into BHK-21 cells and used for a subcellular fractionation study to determine if fusion proteins containing different parts from the CCHFV G N cytoplasmic domain are soluble or membrane associated. A GFP-specific antibody was used for the immunoblot. Representative results from three constructs are shown. M: membrane fraction, S: soluble fraction.",
