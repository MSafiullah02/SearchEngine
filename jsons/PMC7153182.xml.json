This has resulted in the application of innovative digital health solutions to provide educational content and continuity. In the United Kingdom, for example, doctors in training will have their Annual Review of Clinical Progression (ARCP) assessments held virtually, alongside a range of other virtual approaches to protect trainees and their progression during the pandemic.11 Alongside this, a range of innovative e-learning packages have been produced far quicker than digital content would be usually, in order to facilitate upskilling of the healthcare workforce in the treatment of viral respiratory illnesses. There are good examples of innovative e-learning packages to support preparedness, including, as an example, a bespoke redeployment training package that was created in less than 72 h at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS Trust, in the West Midlands region, UK.12",

            "text": "Perhaps the greatest digital health transformation has been the rapid development and implementation of new models of care, supported by digital health innovation. These digital approaches have arisen out of a need to shield vulnerable patients from being exposed to the risks of coming into hospital, promoting social distances and protecting staff. In the UK, this has been facilitated across both primary and secondary care by the use of telemedicine consultation approaches.13 There has been significant innovation and support from the MedTech sector, with the rapid rollout of digital tools and packages. For example, EMIS (Egton Medical Information Systems), the UK\u2019s largest supplier of electronic health records to primary care, has introduced a range of interventions, including modifying coding, alert tracking and the enabling of video consultations, free of charge to all EMIS web general practitioner (GP) practices in the UK.14 Similarly, NHS Trusts have been rushing to implement remote consultation solutions. The vast majority of clinic attendances have switched to remote consultation methods, ranging from basic telephone-based consultations to more complex video-conference based telemedicine or App based solutions.15 Multi-disciplinary team meetings have switched from in-person attendance to Zoom and other platforms to facilitate complex care decisions being made without risking physical gatherings of large groups of healthcare staff. The implementation of these digital care processes has required the rapid navigation of governance and digital integration, which has been facilitated by the urgent need created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Without this, implementation may have been significantly slower.",

The human costs of the disease will unfortunately be very high and long remembered. Despite this, through such adversity, the healthcare system that works to protect us may become stronger and more robust. A central foundation of this change will be the development and implementation of new ways of remote and digital health working. Adversity has long been an important driver of innovation and modernisation of healthcare, with previous such lessons typically learnt periods of conflict and warfare (such as casualty clearing stations and modern blood transfusion practice).16,17 We must ensure we learn from this period of adversity in the same way, and look to sustainably embed this new dawn of digital health practices in the care models of the future.",
