These viruses are spread by the fecal -oral route and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Foods may be contaminated at any time pre -or post -harvest; however, many outbreaks are associated with foods handled by infected restaurant workers. Produce may be contaminated by improper irrigation or fertilization practices, by the hands of infected pickers or processors, or as the result of adulteration during any stage of handling. Outbreaks have been commonly associated with foods which are served raw or only lightly cooked, such as molluscan shellfish, fruits and vegetables, and salads or products contaminated after cooking like frosted bakery products. The farming, shellfish, processing, transportation, and restaurant industries must maintain vigilance to reduce outbreaks of enteric virus illness. Intervention strategies to enhance product safety include increased industry and consumer education; changes in industrial practices, product management, and processing technologies; worker immunizations; and the development of improved monitoring tools for the detection of enteric viruses in foods.",

            "text": "Enteric viruses comprise a broad assortment of viruses that are transmissible to humans through contaminated food and water and through person -to -person contamination. Among the most notable foodborne enteric viruses are hepatitis A and E viruses, small round -structured viruses, and group A rotaviruses. All of these viruses can be spread readily to foods during food production, processing, and handling. Hepatitis A virus has contributed to numerous foodborne outbreaks and is often associated with raw or lightly cooked shellfish [ 83 ] . The largest foodborne outbreak of hepatitis A was from the consumption of contaminated clams where nearly 300,000 people became sick during a 3 -month period [ 38 ] . In the United States, hepatitis A causes an estimated 83,000 illnesses per year [ 70 ] . To date, there have been only two reported cases of domestically acquired hepatitis E in the United States [ 29, 56 ] . Epidemics of hepatitis E have been reported in Asia, Africa, and Mexico [ 19 ] . Both of these viruses can migrate from the intestinal tract to infect and damage the liver, leading to jaundice and, occasionally, death. Hepatitis A is often self -limiting and spontaneous recovery is common [ 88 ] . The fatality rate from hepatitis A is about 100 per year in the United States [ 57 ] . Hepatitis E has a low mortality rate for the general population ( 0.5 -3.0% ); however, pregnant women have a mortality rate between 15% and 25% [ 64 ] . The incubation period for hepatitis A is 25 -45 days, whereas the incubation period for hepatitis E is 15 -60 days.",

The use of poliovirus has provided much information on the effectiveness of various treatments and processes for the disinfection of foods and food contact surfaces. Nearly all of the polioviruses present in the environment are vaccine strains which enter the environment from the stools of children recently immunized with an attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine. This vaccine is being phased out and the inactivated, injectable vaccine is being employed to remove all traces of poliovirus from the environment. Currently, polio has been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere and there is substantial progress being made to eradicate the disease worldwide. Over the next few years, it is likely that polio will be eradicated and that laboratory strains, even attenuated vaccine strains, will have to be destroyed. Soon, the poliovirus model will be a thing of the past. Unfortunately, there is no good successor for poliovirus; however, feline calcivirus is becoming a popular model for research on Norwalk -like viruses [ 93 ] .",

Nonpoint sources of pollution, like land runoff into watersheds and discharge of human wastes from boats, have caused major pollution events leading to foodborne illness [ 8, 13, 54, 67 ] .

Improper dumping of septage or the leaching from baby diaper and related wastes from sanitary landfills can contribute to contamination of groundwater, which may in turn be used for drinking or irrigation. Dumps also contain insects, rodents, birds, raccoons, and other pests which may carry viruses many miles from the original disposal site. It is uncertain as to what extent wind and evaporation contribute to virus dispersal, although the incidence of illness among farm workers using spray irrigation of wastewater appears low [ 33, 59 ] .

Infected workers handling foods may transmit hepatitis A virus, Norwalk -like virus, and other enteric viruses to foods and no level of food processing will eliminate post -processing contamination. Virtually any food handled by ill workers may become contaminated, although certain food products have received more attention than others. Among the foods most commonly cited as contributing to viral illness from handling by infected workers are salads, raw fruits and vegetables [ 36, 52, 61, 62, 78 ] , and bakery products [ 103, 107 ] -foods that may be handled frequently and are not generally heated or reheated after handling. Cross -contamination of processed products by raw materials, like the contamination of salad by raw seafood, has also been reported [ 36 ] . Adequate plant sanitation may reduce the threat of product cross -contamination. Water must be of sanitary quality if it is to be used in food processing as an added ingredient in food preparation, or for use in manufacturing ice. Celery contaminated with non -potable water was responsible for an outbreak of Norwalk virus gastroenteritis, causing morbidity in over 1400 people [ 105 ] . Ice may become contaminated during or after production and can lead to food -or water-borne illness [ 12, 51, 58 ] .",

            "text": "Although most food -related industries are conscientious in producing safe and wholesome products, some are at higher risk of producing tainted products by the very nature of the food or the production process. Foods served raw or only lightly cooked are at greatest risk of transmitting viral contaminants obtained from either pre -or post -harvest sources. The molluscan shellfish industry is particularly susceptible since: ( i ) shellfish can bioconcentrate viruses within their edible tissues to levels much higher than in the water itself; ( ii ) there are no good methods to ascertain whether the shellfish or their harvest waters contain infectious viruses; and ( iii ) shellfish are frequently eaten raw or only lightly cooked. Outbreaks of foodborne viral illness have been attributable to viruscontaminated shellfish [ 20, 83 ] . For the fruit and vegetable industries, farming practices, including fertilization and irrigation techniques, product transportation, and the health of the harvesters themselves, are coming under increased scrutiny. Today, food processors have an extensive list of disinfectants for sanitizing processing surfaces, but many disinfectants are ineffective in inactivating enteric viruses. Processors may also be unfamiliar with the best methods to apply disinfectants. There are many questions concerning processing conditions necessary to fully eliminate virus contaminants and further research is needed in this area. The transportation industry must share the responsibility of maintaining clean trucks, ice, boxes, pallets, etc., to haul food products. It is fortunate for food transporters that human enteric viruses do not replicate in foods even under abuse temperatures. The transportation industry should follow the same safeguards as for protecting foods from external sources of bacterial contamination. Perhaps, the segment of the economy most at risk from virus contamination of foods is the restaurant industry. They are impacted most because they have a greater potential for contaminating foods due to extensive handling, often by inexperienced and untrained workers. Restaurants may be held liable in civil and criminal prosecutions if their products cause illness. The restaurant trade is, by no means, the only industry culpable in the event of an outbreak, so all facets of the production from the growth, harvest, and distribution, to the processing and marketing industries must be accountable for their role in ensuring safe foods. Hotels and restaurants reportedly have a high level of virus transmission through person -to -person contacts [ 68 ] . Cruise ship lines have also been hit hard by enteric virus -like illness [ 42, 43, 51, 69 ] . Outbreaks often involve a substantial number of passengers and crew. In these cases, transmission is not only from direct consumption of contaminated foods, but likely from person -to -person spread.",

Wastewater should be subjected to, at least, primary and secondary treatments followed by chlorination or ultraviolet ( UV ) light disinfection to reduce virus levels. Wastewater irrigation may pose a particular risk for produce that is consumed raw. Viruses from spray irrigation may be harbored on the surfaces of fruits and vegetables and can lead to illness if the produce is not adequately washed or peeled.

Although the fecal coliform standard does not correlate directly with the levels of viruses in the water or in the shellfish, outbreaks of enteric virus illness are not often reported for shellfish obtained from approved harvesting waters. The shellfish industry and regulatory agencies should continue to actively pursue shellfish poachers who obtain shellstock from closed areas.

            "text": "Viruses may be present in seemingly clean foods. Since viruses are not associated with product spoilage, flavor and odor changes that signal spoilage from bacteria will not indicate the virological quality or safety of foods. Therefore, it is important to provide a system of checks and balances to ensure the safety of all foods. The food industry has subscribed to a new approach to protect the nation's food supply known as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point ( HACCP ) system [ 10, 16 ] . Under the HACCP system, food operations must develop and implement a plan, based on sound scientific data and reasoning, to identify those points in the operation most likely to contribute to product contamination. These become the critical control points for the operation. The HACCP approach also requires that the critical control points be monitored to ensure proper operation of the system. In the case of cooked products, cooking times and temperatures would be monitored to ensure adequate inactivation of microbes. For canning operations, times and temperatures are routinely monitored to ensure that they are adequate to eliminate the presence of Clostridium spores. Similar safeguards are needed to control and eliminate viral contaminants. Many factors go into the development of a HACCP plan, but all too often, the health status of the employee is highly subjective. To reduce foodborne illness, employee health must be a prime consideration for all sectors of the food industry. Epidemiological data should also be used to design HACCP and risk assessment systems [ 81 ] . Over the next few years, HACCP is likely to expand into new areas of the food industry to encompass all aspects of the farm -to -fork continuum.",

Unfortunately, routine testing of viral contaminants in foods is not possible because virus assay procedures are generally lacking.

References from Table 1 should be scrutinized closely to determine if the disinfectants are appropriate for specific applications. Chemical disinfectants should be selected based on their effectiveness against foodborne viruses. Although solutions containing chlorine are effective disinfectants for most viruses, other disinfectants may be more practical or have residual effects to enhance sanitation efforts. In one study evaluating 27 chemical disinfectants for their ability to inactivate rotavirus on glass, plastic, and stainless steel surfaces, only nine were effective: chloramine -T, chlorhexidine gluconate, glutaraldehyde, hydrochloric acid, isopropyl alcohol, peracetic acid, povidone iodine, quaternary ammonium compound, and sodium -o -benzyl -p -chlorophenate [ 60 ] . The treatment of Norwalk virus with up to 10 mg / ml of chlorine for 30 min was insufficient to inactivate all the viruses present as determined by a volunteer study [ 50 ] , although there is some speculation that the amount of free chlorine available was substantially less than 10 mg / ml. In another study, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid, and ozone were effective in reducing poliovirus, echovirus, coxsackievirus type B5, and rotavirus [ 39 ] . Rotavirus was readily inactivated by chlorine dioxide at alkaline pH values [ 22 ] and by chlorine [ 102 ] and ozone [ 101 ] , particularly at acidic and neutral pH values. Chlorine dioxide and iodine, at alkaline pH values, have also been effective in inactivating poliovirus [ 3 ] . Engelbrecht et al [ 28 ] demonstrated that poliovirus types 1 and 2, echovirus types 1 and 5, and coxsackievirus types A9 and B5 were 99% inactivated in 0.3 -4.5 min with residual chlorine levels of $0.5 mg / l at pH values of 6.0 and 7.8; however, at pH 10, inactivation times were substantially increased ( 21 -96 min ) for all viruses except coxsackie A9, which was still rapidly inactivated after 1.5 min. Chlorine solutions at low pH ( pH 6 ) were previously shown to inactivate enteric viruses more readily than chlorine solutions maintained at pH 10 [ 28 ] . Poliovirus was treated with 0.5 mg / l of free chlorine for various intervals, and virus propagation was attempted in cell culture followed by detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) [ 17 ] . Poliovirus required 10 min for inactivation to non -detectable levels, demonstrating that poliovirus is five times more sensitive than previously expected [ 17 ] .",

Disinfectant solutions or detergents incorporated into the rinse water may facilitate the elimination of gross external contamination, but may be insufficient to remove viral contaminants, particularly if the viruses have penetrated through the skin. Washing and disinfection may not be effective for cut vegetables since viruses may enter the tissues through cuts and abrasions. Leafy vegetables may be more difficult to disinfect because of the rough or wrinkled nature of the surfaces. Likewise, fruits such as strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries have a porous surface texture which may trap viruses beyond the reach of chemical disinfectants. Rinsing without the use of suitable detergents or disinfectants may allow viruses to infiltrate the tissues of fruits and vegetables and to become redistributed onto products that were not previously contaminated. Therefore, individual washing of produce would be better than bulk washing to prevent cross -contamination. Potential disinfectants and cleaning agents must be scrutinized carefully to ensure that they are approved for use in food establishments or on the foods themselves. Sanitation of equipment and food contact surfaces should employ the use of ample detergents and water to rinse away and dilute -if nothing else -the viruses associated with food residues or hand contamination.

[ 84 ] ). Once in clean waters, shellfish will purge at least some of their contaminants, provided that the shellfish are physiologically active and the water conditions, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen are favorable. A similar purging process, known as depuration, is conducted commercially in tanks of clean seawater. The water is usually recirculated through a UV or ozone disinfection system which kills or inactivates any bacteria or viruses present in the water ( reviewed in Refs. [ 84, 85 ] . Relaying requires extended periods ( often 10 days to 2 weeks or more ), whereas depuration may be completed within 48 -72 h. In either case, viruses are reduced in shellfish, but are not totally eliminated; both depuration and relaying are more efficient in eliminating potential bacterial pathogens like E. coli and Salmonella spp. than the enteric viruses. Depurated shellfish can cause enteric virus illness, either as a consequence of improper depuration controls or due to insufficiency in the process itself [ 5, 37 ] . For these reasons, only lightly contaminated shellfish should be subjected to depuration; more heavily contaminated shellstock should be relayed for extended periods. Shellfish -related industries should appreciate the benefits of depuration in reducing bacterial contaminants and intestinal sediment; however, it must be recognized that there are no guarantees that shellfish depurated according to current technologies will be virologically safe.",

Simple processing techniques to minimize direct human contact with foods can further safeguard the food supply. Perhaps, the simplest and most practical example of this concept is to mix salads, coleslaw, and similar products with a spoon or fork rather than by hand. Another example is to use clean food processors to slice and dice vegetables or cheeses destined for raw consumption rather than cut them by hand.

Currently, cell -culture -adapted strains of hepatitis A virus are available for laboratory studies and a feline calicivirus model is available for studies of Norwalk -like viruses. With additional studies on virus -receptor interactions and the use of alternative cell cultures or treatments, it may become possible in the future to directly monitor for hepatitis A and E viruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses, and other viral pathogens in foods.",
