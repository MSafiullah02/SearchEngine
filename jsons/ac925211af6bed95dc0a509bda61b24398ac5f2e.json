Likewise, SDP is an ingredient extensively used globally in pig feed due to its well-known beneficial effects on postweaning performance and survival (Torrallardona 2010) .

Results of the current study demonstrated that a greater reduction in both Salmonella spp. counts was observed at the higher outlet temperature, although it was only statistically significant for S. typhimurium. The minimum outlet spray-drying temperature is 80\u00b0C for the commercial manufacturing process of SDP (Sampedro et al. 2015; P erez-Bosque et al. 2016) and results of the present study suggested that both Salmonella spp. strains were susceptible to spray-drying even at a lower outlet temperature (71\u00b0C). Laboratory spray-dryers are useful for establishing guidelines to scale-up the industrial production of SDP. The main differences between laboratory and pilot plant dryers compared with industrial dryers are design, size and volume processed, all of which affect the retention or dwell time of the product within the chamber (Foster and Leatherman 1995) . Laboratory spray-dryers have reduced retention or dwell time of the product within the chamber (<1 s) compared with commercial dryers (between 20 and 90 s, depending upon scale and design of the dryer). Furthermore, there is an immediate cooling to room temperature of the small quantity of dried product produced by lab dryers in comparison with industrial dryers which process much larger quantity of material that extends the time for dissipation of heat from the dried product. Present results indicated that when extended RT was simulated after drying liquid plasma with a lab dryer at temperatures around 71 or 80\u00b0C, there was a significant reduction in survival of both Salmonella spp. strains that was directly related with the higher RT regardless of outlet drying temperature.
