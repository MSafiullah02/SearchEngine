By the end of the epidemic, which was essentially controlled by isolation, more than 8000 cases have been reported with more than 800 fatalities (World Health Organization, http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/en/). The concerted efforts of the scientific community led to an extraordinarily rapid identification of a novel coronavirus as the aetiological agent of SARS and the full genome sequencing of the virus (Drosten et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003). The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome is \u223c30 kb in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) (Marra et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses and the virion consists of a nucleocapsid core surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins, spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) that are common to all members of the genus (Siddell, 1995, Lai and Holmes, 2001). The RNA is packaged by the nucleocapsid (N) protein into a helical nucleocapsid. The S protein, which forms morphologically characteristic projections on the virion surface, mediates binding to host receptors and membrane fusion. The M protein is a triple-spanning integral membrane protein with a short ectodomain and a large carboxyl-terminus endodomain. More recently, the E protein was shown to play a major role in coronavirus assembly (Bos et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1996). The genes for these structural proteins and the replicase 1a/1b gene, that is located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome and constitute 2/3 of it, are conserved among the subgroups of coronavirus so is their relative position in the genome (Siddell, 1995, de Vries et al., 1997, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Lai and Holmes, 2001). In addition, there are group-specific \u201caccessory\u201d proteins, which are usually dispensable for viral replication but may be important for viral\u2013host interactions. These accessory proteins vary in size and position in the genome.",

            "text": "Analogous to other coronaviruses, the first 2/3 of the SARS-CoV genome encodes the viral replicase genes (ORFs 1a and 1b), which translates into two large polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa) (Thiel et al., 2003). Expression of the ORF 1b-encoded region of pp1ab involves ribosomal frameshifting into the \u22121 frame just upstream of the ORF 1a translation termination codon (Thiel et al., 2003). Proteolytic processings of these polyproteins are mediated by viral cysteine proteinases and produces a minimum of 13 non-structural proteins (also called nsp's), some of which are responsible for replicating the viral genome and/or generating a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs to express all the ORFs downstream of ORF 1b (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). Unlike most coronaviruses, which uses three proteinases for polyprotein processing (Ziebuhr et al., 2000, Gorbalenya, 2001), SARS-CoV is predicted only to have two proteinases, which are a papain-like (accessory) cysteine proteinase (termed as PL2pro), which cleaves at 3 sites, and a 3C-like (main) proteinase (termed 3CLpro or Mpro), which cleaves at 11 sites (Rota et al., 2003, Gao et al., 2003a, Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). As a result, 16 non-structural proteins (Fig. 1A) are predicted but which of these are essential for the replication of the virus remain to be determined. The proteinase activity of 3CLpro was also experimentally demonstrated as purified 3CLpro was shown to cleave peptides covering all the 11 predicted cleavage sites (Fan et al., 2004). In addition, the three-dimensional structure of 3CLpro was also solved by both crystallography and NMR spectroscopy (Yang et al., 2003, Shi et al., 2004). Both studies reported that 3CLpro exists as a dimer and revealed fine conformational details of its interaction with substrates, thus providing a basis for rational drug design.",

Recombinant SARS-CoV helicase has multiple enzymatic activities, including RNA helicase, DNA helicase, NTPase, dNTPase and an RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities (Tanner et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003, Ivanov et al., 2004). In addition, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp9, which has no designated function, has been solved and it has been shown to bind RNA as well as another non-structural protein, SARS-CoV nsp8 (Campanacci et al., 2003, Sutton et al., 2004). The SARS-CoV nsp9 may have a similar function as the nsp9 protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a Group 2 coronavirus, which colocalized and interacted with other proteins of the replication complex (Bost et al., 2000, Brockway et al., 2003). For the remaining non-structural proteins produced from pp1a or pp1ab, putative activities have been predicted based on the presence of functional domains in their sequences or by their structural similarities to other proteins (Gao et al., 2003a, Snijder et al., 2003, von Grotthuss et al., 2003; Fig. 1A).",

As such, S is known to be responsible for inducing host immune responses and virus neutralization by antibodies (Holmes, 2003, Navas-Martin and Weiss, 2003). For SARS-CoV, it has been demonstrated that prior infection provided protective immunity in a mouse model and the passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies to naive mice also protected them from infection (Subbarao et al., 2004). Importantly, there was no enhancement of SARS-CoV infection in mice upon re-infection or after the administration of immune serum, unlike the case for one coronavirus, the feline infectious peritonitis virus (Olsen, 1993). A DNA vaccine encoding the S protein alone induced T cell and neutralizing antibody responses and protected mice from SARS-CoV infection (Yang et al., 2004), suggesting the S is indeed the primary target for viral neutralization in SARS-CoV infection. This finding was also confirmed by several studies that use surrogate/carrier viruses to express S in mice or primates (Gao et al., 2003b, Bisht et al., 2004, Buchholz et al., 2004, Bukreyev et al., 2004). From these studies, it is clear that humoral response against S plays an important role in controlling and clearing SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "The coronavirus S protein is a class I virus fusion protein and contains two regions with a 4, 3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat in S2 domain or C-terminus half of the protein (de Groot et al., 1987, Bosch et al., 2003). These domains (termed as HR1 and HR2) are thought to play an important role in defining the oligomeric structure of S and hence mediating the fusion between viral and cellular membranes (Eckert and Kim, 2001). For the SARS-CoV, HR2 is located close to the transmembrane anchor (1148\u20131193 amino acids) and HR1 is \u223c140 amino acids upstream of it (900\u20131005 amino acids) (Ingallinella et al., 2004). Biochemical studies have shown that peptides corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV S protein can associate into an anti-parallel six-helix bundles with structural features typical of class I fusion proteins, suggesting that the membrane fusion and cell entry mechanisms exploited by SARS-CoV are similar to that for other coronaviruses (Bosch et al., 2004, Ingallinella et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004b, Tripet et al., 2004, Yuan et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004). In the full-length S protein, the HR1\u2013HR2 structure brings the fusion peptide, predicted to be near the N-terminus of HR1 (Bosch et al., 2004), in close proximity to the transmembrane domain and this drives the fusion between viral and cellular membranes, and allows the virus to entry the cell. Indeed, peptides from HR1 or HR2 can inhibit viral replication in Vero E6 culture, presumably by interfering with the formation of the six-helix bundle (Bosch et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004b, Yuan et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004).",

However, it is clear that M and E are important for viral assembly as demonstrated by the formation of virus-like particles in insect cells expressing these proteins (Ho et al., 2004). This result is consistent with previous studies on coronaviruses, which showed that M and E are sufficient for the assembly of viral particles (Bos et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1996). By using a proteomic approach, a novel phosphorylated site of M was also identified (Zeng et al., 2004a), but the importance of this for the function of M has not been defined.",

In addition, it was reported that the SARS-CoV N can induce specific T-cell responses (Gao et al., 2003b, Kim et al., 2004), as have been observed with other coronaviruses (Siddell, 1995), but how important is this for protective immunity remains to be determined.",

In addition, the N protein of SARS-CoV was shown to induce apoptosis and actin reorganization in mammalian cells under stressed conditions (Surjit et al., 2004b). Interestingly, Mizutani et al. (2004) showed that the p38MARK pathway is activated in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells, but it is not clear if this is directly/entirely due to the expression of N. The N proteins of other coronaviruses, including avian infectious bronchitis virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and mouse hepatitis virus, are localized to both cytoplasm and nucleolus, and the presence of N in the nucleolus may be important for the synthesis of viral RNA (Hiscox et al., 2001, Wurm et al., 2001). For SARS-CoV N protein, it has been reported to be found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of SARS-CoV infected cells (Chang et al., 2004, Zeng et al., 2004a).",

Three groups independently reported the expression of 3a in SARS-CoV infected cells (Tan et al., 2004c, Yu et al., 2004, Zeng et al., 2004b) and it is also detected in a SARS-CoV infected patient's lung specimen (Yu et al., 2004). Antibodies against 3a were also found in convalescent patients (Guo et al., 2004, Tan et al., 2004b, Yu et al., 2004, Zeng et al., 2004b). 3a is localized in the perinuclear region and is also transported to the cell surface, where it can undergo internalization (Tan et al., 2004c, Yu et al., 2004). It is intriguing to find that SARS-CoV has evolved to express a viral protein with endocytotic properties, as endocytosis has been shown to play important roles in the replication of a number of viruses as well as their adaptation to the host cells (Marsh and Pelchen-Matthews, 2000). The transportation of 3a to the cell surface depends on a region in the cytoplasmic domain that contains two different sorting motifs, a Yxx\u03a6 (where x is any amino acids and \u03a6 is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic sidechain) upstream of a ExD (diacidic) motif (Tan et al., 2004c). The diacidic motif is required for efficient ER export (Nishimura and Balch, 1997) while the Yxx\u03a6 motif has been implicated in directing protein localization to various intracellular compartments (Bonifacino and Traub, 2003). The juxtaposition of these two motifs appears to be important for the transport of proteins to the plasma membrane (Bannykh et al., 1998).",

Interestingly, when Liu et al. (2004a) used phage-display technology to characterize B cell epitopes recognized by antibodies from SARS patients, they found one consensus motif VKIXN, which corresponded uniquely to 18\u201322 amino acids of the N-terminus ectodomain of 3a. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that 3a could play an important immunological role as it is clearly presented to the host immune system during infection. 3a can also interact specifically with M and E, which are two key players in the viral assembly of coronaviruses, as well as with the S protein (Tan et al., 2004c, Zeng et al., 2004b); hence it may also be important for viral assembly and/or release of virus from infected cells. It is tempting to postulate that 3a is a novel structural protein as only the coronavirus structural proteins, S, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and E, have been shown to be transported to the plasma membrane/cell surface (Kienzle et al., 1990, Parker et al., 1990, Smith et al., 1990, Vennema et al., 1990). Indeed, Zeng et al. (2004b) could detect disulfide-linked complexes of S and 3a in the medium of SARS-CoV infected cells, indicating that 3a was secreted together with S, possibly through the formation of virus particles. However, it is necessary to confirm this finding with highly purified SARS-CoV virions as viral proteins could also be released into the medium through cells lysis.",

An endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval motif (KRKTE), which is important for transport of proteins back to the ER (Teasdale and Jackson, 1996), is located at the C-terminus cytoplasmic domain of 7a and mediates the recycling of 7a between the ER and Golgi apparatus such that 7a is present in the intermediate compartments, where coronaviruses are known to assemble and bud (Fielding et al., 2004). Interestingly 7a can also interact with 3a, which can interact with M, E and S, suggesting that these viral proteins may form complexes during infection (Tan et al., 2004c).",

For example, although the 7b gene of feline coronavirus is easily lost upon virus adaptation to cell culture, it is strictly maintained in naturally occurring strains and its loss was correlated with reduced virulence (Herrewegh et al., 1995). Recent studies also showed that some of these group-specific genes are not essential for viral replication in cell culture, but their deletion, by reverse genetics, is attenuating in the natural host (de Haan et al., 2002, Ortego et al., 2003). It has not yet been established which of these SARS-CoV-unique ORFs are essential for viral replication and/or for viral\u2013host interactions.",

However, it is interesting to note that the part of viral genome that encodes these \u201caccessory\u201d proteins appears to be prone to large insertions or deletions. For example, in some strains of MHV, ORF 4 is interrupted and becomes ORFs 4a and 4b, while in others, ORF 2a is completely deleted (Schwarz et al., 1990, Weiss et al., 1993). Shen et al. (2003) also reported an insertion of six nucleotides in 3b gene of the infectious bronchitis virus after continuous passages in Vero E6 cells and this resulted in a truncated 3b protein of 34 amino acids with only the first 17 amino acids being homologous to the original full-length 3b protein of 64 amino acids. For SARS-CoV, Guan et al. (2003) analyzed SARS-CoV isolates obtained from animals in a live-market in Guangdong and found that all the animal isolates contain a 29-nucleotides sequence which is absent in most human isolates. As a result of this, the ORF 8a (termed as ORF 10 in Guan et al., 2003) and 8b (termed as ORF 11 in Guan et al., 2003) in the human isolates becomes one ORF encoding a protein of 122 amino acids, whose N-terminus is identical to ORF 8a and C-terminus is identical to ORF 8b. Another extensive study of 63 SARS-CoV isolates obtained from early, middle and late phases of the SARS epidemic in China also showed that there are major deletions in this region of the viral genome (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Interestingly, the clustering of patients with different patterns of deletion was correlated with the different phases of the epidemic. Although these mutations do not appear to have any adverse effect on the survival of the virus, it is conceivable that the different variants of ORF 8a/8b have different stabilities and/or functions, and hence would contribute differently to viral pathogenesis in vivo. Another study also reported an in frame deletion of 45 nucleotides in ORF 7b in the Frankfurt isolate after three passages in tissue culture (Thiel et al., 2003). Since SARS-CoV appeared to have only recently crossed species from animal to human and that it has been observed that the profiles of these mutations correlated with clusters of infection, it is likely that the properties of these unique ORFs are changing as the virus undergoes adaptive evolution and these mutations could cause SARS-CoV infection to become more benign but more persistent.",

Together with the technologies to create transgenic or knockout mice, the mouse model will contribute to the developments of vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics against SARS-CoV infection and may also help us understand why certain cohorts of patients are more vulnerable to the disease while others only develop mild symptoms. In addition, experimentally SARS-CoV infected cats, ferrets and primates can develop at least some of the clinical symptoms observed in SARS-CoV infected patients (Martina et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2004).

(A) Replicase genes (ORFs 1a and 1b), constituting the first 2/3 of the genome, translate into two large polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa). Expression of the ORF 1b-encoded region of pp1ab involves ribosomal frameshifting into the \u22121 frame just upstream of the ORF 1a translation termination codon. Proteolytic processings of these polyproteins are mediated by viral cysteine proteinases (nsp3, also called PL2pro and nsp5, also called 3CLpro or Mpro) resulting in 16 non-structural proteins (nsp's; open boxes). Putative functional domains present in each nsp's are shown in the text boxes. Functions that have been demonstrated with recombinant proteins are underlined. (B) Open reading frames (ORFs) in the remaining 1/3 of the genome are translated from eight subgenomic mRNAs. Four of these encode the structural proteins (checked boxes), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). Another eight SARS-CoV-unique ORFs (grey solid boxes) encode putative \u201caccessory\u201d proteins with no significance sequence homology to viral proteins of other coronaviruses (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b). The cellular localization and functions of some of these viral proteins have been demonstrated (see text boxes). Also note that S, E, M and ORF 6 are expressed from individual subgenomic mRNAs, while 3a and 3b are predicted to be produced from the same subgenomic mRNA. Similarly, 7a and 7b are also produced from one subgenomic mRNA, and 9b is produced from the same subgenomic mRNA as N. The expression of 3b, 7b and 9b may be via \u201cleaky scanning\u201d by ribosomes or involve a mechanism like internal ribosomal entry. However, it cannot be rule out that they may also be expressed from the synthesis of yet undetected additional subgenomic mRNAs.",
