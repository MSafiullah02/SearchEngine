            "text": "Being infected by SARS-CoV-2 may cause damage to multiple organs in patients, such as the lung, liver and heart. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), reported as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is also expressed in human male testes. This suggests a potential risk in human male reproductive system. However, the characteristics of ACE2-positive cells and the expression of other SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes are still worthy of further investigation. Here, we performed singlecell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) analysis on 853 male embryo primordial germ cells (PGCs) and 2,854 normal testis cells to assess the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the male reproductive system from embryonic stage to adulthood. We also collected and constructed the scRNA-seq library on 228 Sertoli cells from three non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients to assess the effects at disease state. We found that ACE2 expressing cells existed in almost all testis cell types and Sertoli cells had highest expression level and positive cells ratio. Moreover, ACE2 was also expressed in human male PGCs. In adulthood, the level of ACE2 expression decreased with the increase of age. We also found that ACE2 positive cells had high expressions of stress response and immune activation-related genes. Interestingly, some potential SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes such as TMPRSS2, BSG, CTSL and CTSB had different expression patterns in the same cell type. Furthermore, ACE2 expression level in NOA donors' Sertoli cells was significantly decreased. Our work would help to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the male reproductive system. .

            "text": "ACE2 has been reported to be expressed in several systems such as the respiratory system, digestive system, cardiovascular system and urinary system (Zou et al., 2020) . In normal mice, there is no gender difference in ACE2 activity between the heart and lungs, but ACE2 activity in male kidneys is higher than that in female kidneys (Liu et al., 2010) . The difference may be due to the secretion of E2 in females (Liu et al., 2010) . This suggests that ACE2 may have different expression patterns in male and female gonads. The expression of ACE2 in testis cells at the single cell level has been found mainly concentrated in spermatogonia, Sertoli cells and Leydig cells (Shen, 2020; Wang and Xu, 2020) . The ratio of ACE2 expressing spermatogonia to all spermatogonia is similar to that in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) and these ACE2 expressing cells are enriched in viral reproduction pathway (Wang and Xu, 2020) . ACE2 has also been reported selectively expressed by adult Leydig cells and may play a crucial role in regulating steroidogenesis (Douglas et al., 2004) . In NOA patients, the mRNA expression levels of ACE2 and MAS are decreased, suggesting that these genes may be associated with male infertility (Reis et al., 2010) . In addition, previous studies have shown that TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020) , CD147 , and CatB/L (Hoffmann et al., 2020) are also important for SARS-CoV-2 virus to invade host cells.",

Based on this ratio we found that spermatogonial stem cells (SSC), differentiating spermatogonia (Diff.ing SPG), leptotene spermatocytes type1 (L1), leptotene spermatocytes type 3 (L3), zygotene spermatocytes (Z), diplotene spermatocytes (D), spermatocyte 7 (SPC7), spermatids stage 1 (S1) and three types of testis somatic cells might be susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, more than 90% Sertoli cells expressed ACE2 ( Figure 1D ). In all ACE2 expressing cells, Sertoli cells accounted for the largest proportion ( Figure 1C ). This suggested that the testis somatic cells, especially Sertoli cells, might be more susceptible than germ cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection (P<2.22\u00d710",
