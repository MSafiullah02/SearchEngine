This has been best exemplified in the emergence of the recent swine-origin influenza, avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics (Guan et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2005a, Lau et al., 2009a, Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team et al., 2009, Peiris et al., 2003, Woo et al., 2004, Yuen et al., 1998). For SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the etiological agent of SARS, horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses while palm civets were only amplification hosts for animal to human transmission (Guan et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005). In retrospect, such findings are not surprising, as bats are known to be reservoir of many emerging infections in humans (Wong et al., 2007).",

There are currently five genera within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, namely Respirovirus, Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus and Avulavirus, although some members of the subfamily remain unclassified. Among members of Paramyxovirinae, measles virus, mumps virus, and human parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134 are most well known human paramyxoviruses that cause outbreaks of respiratory to systemic infections (Lau et al., 2005b, Lau et al., 2009b, Virtue et al., 2009).",

Before the emergence of Nipah virus (NipPV) and Hendra virus (HenPV) which belong to the genus Henipavirus (Chua et al., 2000), only two bat paramyxoviruses, both belonging to the genus Rubulavirus, were known to exist (Henderson et al., 1995, Hollinger and Pavri, 1971, Karabatsos, 1985, Pavri et al., 1971). The first was a bat parainfluenza virus isolated from a Rousettus leschenaulti bat in India in 1966 (Hollinger and Pavri, 1971), whereas the other was Mapuera virus (MapPV) isolated from the salivary glands of another fruit bat, Sturnira lilium, captured in the tropical rainforest of Brazil in 1979 (Karabatsos, 1985). In 1994, outbreaks of fatal respiratory disease and meningoencephlaitis occurred in horses and humans in Australia. A novel paramyxovirus, HenPV, was found to be the etiological agent which was originated from fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (Halpin et al., 2000, Young et al., 1996). Menangle virus (MenPV), first isolated from stillborn piglets in a commercial piggery in Australia in 1997, has also been detected from fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (Chant et al., 1998, Philbey et al., 1998). In 1999, another novel paramyxovirus, NipPV, was identified as the causative agent of outbreaks of fatal encephalitis in pig-farmers in Malaysia (Chua et al., 1999, Chua et al., 2000). The virus has also been isolated from fruit bats of the genus Pteropus which are likely the natural reservoir (Enserink, 2000). During the search for the animal reservoir of NipPV, a new paramyxovirus, Tioman virus (TioPV), was isolated from pooled urine samples of fruit bats, Pteropus hypomelanus, in Tioman Island, Malaysia in 2001 (Chua et al., 2001). MenPV and TioPV are antigenically related and belong to the genus Rubulavirus (Chua et al., 2001).",

The sequences of ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 conform to the rule of six as in other paramyxovirus genomes. Their genome organizations are similar to other rubulaviruses, containing six open reading frames (ORFs) coding for putative nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P/V), matrix (M), fusion (F), attachment (HN), and large (L) proteins (Supplementary Table 2). Pairwise alignment of the predicted gene products among ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2, ThkPV-3 and other paramyxoviruses showed the highest amino acid identities with the genus Rubulavirus (Table 2\n). The lengths, positions and characteristics of the major structural genes and intergenic regions (IGRs) are summarized in Table 3\nand Supplementary Table 2. Genomes of Paramyxovirinae typically contain a 55-nt 3' leader sequence and a 5' trailer sequence of variable length. The terminal 11\u201314 nt of the 3' leader and 5' trailer sequences are complementary and highly conserved within each genus, which constitute critical elements of the promoter sequences for initiation of transcription and replication (Lamb and Parks, 2007). The genomes of ThkPV-1 also contains a 14-nt complementary 3' leader and 5' trailer sequence, while there is a GA \u2192 AG substitution in the genome sense at the 5th and 6th position of the 5' trailer sequence in ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3, similar to that observed in porcine rubulavirus (NC_009640.1) (Fig. 2\n). Notably, within the first 14-nt 3'-leader sequences conserved among rubulaviruses, a unique AG \u2192 GA substitution was observed in the three novel viruses (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "Most members of the Paramyxovirinae contain a conserved UC-rich editing site that allows for the addition of non-templated G residues to mRNA products during P/V gene transcription, resulting in the production of different proteins with a common N-terminal region (Thomas et al., 1988). This common N-terminal region consists of 173 aa in ThkPV-1, and 163 aa in ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3. Analysis of each of the P/V gene sequences of the three genomes revealed the presence of a stretch of poly-G residues that could potentially be used as RNA editing sites (Lamb and Parks, 2007). To determine the exact location of the P gene editing site and the number and frequency of G residue insertions, a pair of primers were designed to amplify a small cDNA fragment and the resulting PCR products were cloned and the number of G insertions determined by sequence determination of different clones. Since the amount of mRNA from sample ThkPV-2/330 was inadequate, another strain of ThkPV-2/405 was used for mRNA isolation and cloning for ThkPV-2. A total of 40, 28 and 32 independent clones were obtained for ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3, respectively. From all three samples, mRNAs encoding for two different proteins, V protein (mRNA sequence the same as genomic RNA sequence without G insertion) and P protein (2-G insertion), were identified (Table 4\n). For ThkPV-1, among the 40 sequenced clones, 28 (70%) contained the sequence TTTAAGAGGGG (without G insertion) (encoding V protein), 10 (25%) contained the sequence TTTAAGAGGGGGG (2-G insertion) (encoding P protein), while one of the remaining clones contained 3-G insertion (encoding V protein) and the other remaining clone contained 5-G insertion (encoding P protein). For ThkPV-2, among the 28 sequenced clones, the majority of clones (23 clones, 82%) contained the sequence TTTTAAGAGGGGGGG (2-G insertion) (encoding P protein) while 5 (18%) contained the sequence TTTTAAGAGGGGG (without G insertion) (encoding V protein). For ThkPV-3, among the 32 sequenced clones, 13 (41%) contained the sequence TTTAAGAGGGGG (without G insertion) (encoding V protein), 17 (53%) contained the sequence TTTAAGAGGGGGGG (2-G insertion) (encoding P protein), while the remaining two clones contained 3-G insertion (encoding V protein). The sequence TTTAAGA preceding the poly-G residues is identical to that observed in other rubulaviruses as the putative transcriptional termination signal (Chua et al., 2001). None of the clones were found to contain 1-G insertion that encodes the W protein which is also rarely transcribed in MenPV and TioPV (Table 4) (Bowden et al., 2001, Chua et al., 2001).",

Similar to other rubulaviruses except HpiPV-4, the F proteins of ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 have multibasic protein cleavage site with furin recognition site (R-X-K/R-R) followed by a highly conserved fusion peptide (Supplementary Fig. 2). The furin recognition site allows cleavage in the trans-Golgi membranes and delivery of F proteins to the plasma membrane as active F proteins (Morrison, 2003). F proteins with single-basic residues at the cleavage site, as observed in HpiPV-4, must be cleaved by an extracellular host enzyme usually found exclusively in the respiratory tract, rendering infections by these paramyxoviruses limited to the respiratory tract (Morrison, 2003). Two heptad repeat sequences similar to those in F proteins of other paramyxoviruses were also identified in the F1 of ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3. The F proteins of ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 also contain the 10 Cys residues that are highly conserved in other rubulaviruses and six to nine potential N-glycosylation sites, most of which located in the F1 peptide.",

Similar to TioPV and MenPV, the globular head domains of ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 contained eight pairs of cysteine residues, which are potential sites of disulfide bond (Crennell et al., 2000).

Multiple alignment of the corresponding domains in the L proteins of ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 with those of other rubulaviruses showed that these motifs are also conserved in the three novel paramyxoviruses (Supplementary Fig. 3).

            "text": "In the present study, three novel paramyxoviruses, ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3, from Leschenault's rousette bats are described. The three viruses formed three distinct branches within the genus Rubulavirus and are most closely related to two other bat paramyxoviruses, MenPV and TioPV, upon phylogenetic analysis of a 408-bp fragment of the L gene sequence. The amino acid sequences in the various predicted proteins of the three novel viruses also possessed higher amino acid identities to those of other rubulaviruses than to those of non-rubulaviruses, supporting their classification under the genus Rubulavirus. Complete genome sequencing of each strain from each of the three novel viruses also showed distinct genome features between the three viruses and different from other rubulaviruses. The 3'-leader sequence of the three viruses are unique among rubulaviruses by possessing the GA residues instead of AG residues at the 5th and 6th positions. ThkPV-1 is different from ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 by having a perfect complementary 5' trailer and 3' leader sequence, instead of GA \u2192 AG substitution found only in ThkPV-2, ThkPV-3 and porcine rubulavirus among all rubulaviruses (Fig. 2). ThkV1 possesses the largest genome size among all rubulaviruses with the longest reported IGR sequence (124 nt) between HN and L genes. Moreover, the HN protein sequences of ThkV1 contains a unique pair of cysteine at a position different from the one conserved among ThkPV-2, ThkPV-3, TioPV and MenPV. As for ThkPV-2, it is different from ThkPV-1 and ThkPV-3 by the presence of the G residue instead of A residue at + 1 position in all its predicted mRNA sequences. ThkPV-3 is unique among rubulaviruses by the absence of the conserved N-terminal motif of the N protein, MSSV, which is substituted by MASL. These results support that ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 represent three separate novel rubulavirus species. Nevertheless, phylogenetic trees constructed using N, P, M, F, A and L gene sequences all showed that ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 are more closely related to each other than to other rubulaviruses. Together with their same host bat species, it is likely that the three novel bat rubulaviruses have originated from the same common ancestor, and have subsequently diverged into three separate species.",

            "text": "The pathogenic potential of the present three novel bat paramyxoviruses remains to be determined. Since the emergence of HenPV, five other novel paramyxoviruses have been identified in the past few years, including MenPV, NipPV, Tupaia paramyxovirus (TupPV), Salem virus (SalPV) and TioPV. Besides HenPV and NipPV, only MenPV among these novel paramyxoviruses was known to have potential of causing disease in human. Serological evidence of human MenPV infection has been demonstrated in at least two cases in close contact with infected pigs and developed influenza-like illness (Bowden et al., 2001, Chant et al., 1998). In contrast, the pathogenicity of the other three new viruses in both animals and humans was less well understood. TupPV was first isolated from the kidneys of an apparently healthy tree shrew from Bangkok in 1999 (Tidona et al., 1999). SalPV was incidentally isolated from horse mononuclear cells during search for an unrelated equine illness, whereas TioPV was isolated from urine samples of fruit bats with no reported disease association (Chua et al., 2001, Renshaw et al., 2000). In the present study, all the Leschenault's rousette bats positive for the three novel paramyxoviruses appeared well without evidence of disease, as in the case of many other bat viruses (Lau et al., 2005a, Lau et al., 2007, Wong et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2006c, Woo et al., 2007). Nevertheless, it is likely that they may have a wide tissue tropism, as ThkPV-1 and ThkPV-3 were detected in both alimentary and respiratory specimens. Western blot analysis using the recombinant N proteins showed that antibodies to ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 were present in 52\u201365% of serum samples from Leschenault's rousette bats, supporting that the bat species is the natural reservoir. This is in line with the finding of high prevalence (up to 46%) of neutralizing antibodies to MenPV in flying foxes (Pteropus spp.) in Australia (Philbey et al., 2008). Antibodies against TioPV has been detected in serum samples from fruit bats in Madagascar, including two from the genus Pteropus and one from the species R. madagascariensis (Iehl\u00e9 et al., 2007). Possible serological evidence of human infection by TioPV has also been demonstrated in 3 (1.8%) of 169 human serum samples from inhabitants of Tioman Island, Malaysia (Yaiw et al., 2007). It has been shown that MenPV and TioPV are antigenically related, with recombinant N and V proteins of TioPV cross-reacting with porcine anti-MenPV sera in Western blot assay (Chua et al., 2001). Since the N proteins of ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 and ThkPV-3 share 57\u201364% amino acid identities, cross-reactivity among the present assays cannot be excluded. Further studies on human serum samples, different bat tissue samples such as urine and development of cell culture isolation may provide better insight into the pathogenicity of the three novel paramyxoviruses.",

            "text": "The megachiropteran frugivorous bat, R. leschenaulti, is an important bat species associated with a number of emerging viruses, including flaviviruses, rabies virus, coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses. R. leschenaulti is a large fruit bat species with a wingspan of over 400 mm and is widely distributed in Southern China and South and Southeast Asia (http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/conservation/hkbiodiversity/database/popup_record.asp?id=3306&lang=en). As early as in the 1960s, antibodies against Kyasanur Forest disease virus of the tick-borne encephalitis virus group under Flaviviridae family were detected in Leschenault's rousette bats near Poona, India (Pavri and Singh, 1965). West Nile virus was also subsequently isolated from the same bat species in India (Paul et al., 1970). In a recent seroprevalence study, Leschenault's rousette bats from China were also found to possess antibody against rabies virus (Jiang et al., 2009). The presence of coronavirus in Leschenault's rousette bats is unknown until our recent description of two novel coronaviruses, bat-CoV HKU9, under a novel subgroup 2d of group 2 coronaviruses; and bat-CoV HKU10, a group 1 coronavirus, in this bat species in China (Woo et al., 2007). Bat-CoV HKU9 and bat-CoV HKU10 was detected in the alimentary specimens of 42 (12%) and 1 (0.3%) of 350 tested Leschenault's rousette bats (Woo et al., 2007). Interestingly, five of the 15 samples positive for ThkPV-1, ThkPV-2 or ThkPV-3 from Leschenault's rousette bats were found to carry bat-CoV HKU9 (unpublished data). As for paramyxoviruses, a bat parainfluenza virus, antigenically related to simian virus 41, was isolated from a Leschenault's rousette bat collected at Poona, India in 1966 (Hollinger and Pavri, 1971, Pavri et al., 1971). The virus demonstrated pathogenicity in suckling mice, check embryos and white leghorn chicks (Hollinger and Pavri, 1971). However, further studies on paramyxoviruses in Leschenault's rousette bat were lacking until the present finding of three novel rubulaviruses most closely related to MenPV and TioPV. Continuous surveillance of this bat species in the region is important in understanding their role in emerging infectious diseases.",

            "text": "We speculate that there may still be unidentified paramyxoviruses in various bat populations. Bats are the only flying mammals which account for 20% of the > 4800 mammalian species in the world. In addition to SARS-CoV, they are important reservoir of other emerging zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra and Nipah viruses, Ebola virus, rabies virus and other lyssaviruses, and fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum (Leroy et al., 2005, Lyon et al., 2004, Mackenzie and Field, 2004). For SARS-CoV, Hendra, Nipah, and Ebola virus, bats are the natural reservoir and human infection only occurred after cross-species transmission through an intermediate amplifying host such as palm civet in the case of SARS-CoV. However, bats may also transmit viruses directly to humans, as in the case of rabies virus and other lyssaviruses. Among the 60 viral species reported to be associated with bats, 59 are RNA viruses, which are associated with a high mutation and/or recombination rates that may be important in the adaptation to new hosts and emergence in humans (Lau et al., 2005a, Wong et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2006b). For example, the existence of coronaviruses in bats is unknown until a search for the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV during which a previously unknown diversity of bat coronaviruses including bat-SARS-CoV were identified (Lau et al., 2005a, Lau et al., 2007, Li et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2006c, Woo et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2009a, Woo et al., 2009b). The finding of Leschenault's rousette bats as reservoir for ThkV1, ThkV2 and ThkV3 and other fruit bats as reservoir for MenPV, TioPV, HenPV and NipPV suggested that there may be other unknown paramyxovirues in bats especially fruit bats. Although novel paramyxoviruses were only identified in Leschenault's rousette bats in the present study, the total number of bats from other species that were screened was just half the number of Leschenault's rousette bats. Further studies in bats of other species and in other countries may help better understanding of the molecular evolution of paramyxoviruses among these animals and their emerging potential.",
