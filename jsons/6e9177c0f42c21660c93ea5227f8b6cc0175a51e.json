We collected information, which were posted online as of February 25, 2020, on demographic characteristics of the directors of provincial and municipal Health Committee in Chinese mainland, and analyzed the education level and medical education background of the directors based on different geographic regions and per capita GDP. We found that the overall information disclosure rate is insufficient (63.39%). The mean age of the directors of provincial and municipal health committee was ~54 years. Among the 277 officials whose information is available, those in economically less-developed regions or remote areas had significantly poorer educational background. Regardless of economic status, the proportion of officials with a background of medical education in most regions was low. A significant amount of the directors of the provincial and municipal health committees in China lacks a background of medical education. This may hinder the efficiency of healthcare and public health administration, which obviously requires personnel with a background of medical training, especially considering the current outbreak of COVID-19.",

Besides, after 2009, China started to deepen the reform of the healthcare system, but the re-construction of the public health system is still lagging behind, even being marginalized in certain circumstances. More importantly, the promotion of performance-based pay reforming in the CDC system eventually developed into a new round of cauldron rice, which severely attenuated the enthusiasm of public health personnel. In the meantime, compared with the rapid development of medical and health services, public health talents with the same medical background have a huge psychological gap 12 .
