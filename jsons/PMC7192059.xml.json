Although attempts were made by telemedicine to compensate for the cancellation of all outpatient activities, the authors were concerned about delivering a primary diagnosis of malignant disease via telemedicine.

Physical rehabilitation and surgeons\u2019 postoperative follow-ups were also reported to be severely impaired. The described disruption of orthopaedic healthcare services in Austria, Germany and Switzerland has to be viewed as historic. Even among surgeons with more than 20 years of professional experience such a disruption was deemed unprecedented.

That study by Thaler et al. investigated potential disruptions in joint arthroplasty services all across Europe. Similar to our study, the authors used an online survey to ask arthroplasty surgeons of (a) the European Hip Society and (b) the European Knee Associates about cutbacks in total joint arthroplasty. Thaler et al. reported that of the 272 participants, only 5.9% were still able to offer primary elective total joint arthroplasty. Aseptic arthroplasty revisions were reported by 3.8% of the participants to still be taking place. They further communicated that 87.2%, 75.6% and 25.8% of their survey participants were operating on periprosthetic fractures, doing septic arthroplasty revisions and tumour arthroplasties, respectively. Taken together, the results of the study by Thaler et al. were quite congruent with the findings of this study. This is to say that only fractures, malignancies and severe infections are being treated surgically. However, the comparability of the two studies might be impaired because the study at hand consulted mainly surgeons preferring sports orthopaedics, while Thaler et al. consulted mainly arthroplasty surgeons. Another aspect possibly influencing comparability is that in our study, the participants\u2019 origin was Austria, Germany and Switzerland, while the other study included surgeons from all over Europe.",

Similar to the cutbacks in orthopaedic surgery, a reduction of at least 25% in major organ transplantation was reported over recent weeks. According to Angelico et al., that cutback was due to the fact that beds at the intensive care units were reserved for COVID-19 patients. Connor et al. [3] worried about the implications of the pandemic for urology patients, especially those with malignant disease. The authors stated that they tried by telemedicine to compensate for the cancellation of all outpatient activities, but were concerned about delivering a primary diagnosis of malignant disease via telemedicine. Colorectal surgeons reported that their workload was reduced in all aspects of patient care. They stated that the reduction in case numbers had a profound effect on their healthcare services [7].",

However, no publication has described the impact of the pandemic on the social life of physicians. It is demonstrated by the findings of the study that the pandemic is having a huge impact on the behaviour of orthopaedic surgeons towards their families at home. Only 2% of the survey participants reported making no changes in their behaviour at all, while 29.3% of our surgeons reported isolating themselves in different ways at home (13.2% kept distance to other family member, 8.6% avoided physical contact, 4.7% lived in separate rooms at home, 2.8% no longer went home, because they were afraid to harm their family). Because healthcare professionals like physicians are at risk of contracting COVID-19 [6], orthopaedic surgeons in Austria, Germany and Switzerland are obviously trying to protect their families from the disease and, therefore, are declining to have physical contact with them or even see them. Hence, 40.3% of all ticked response options showed some kind of self-imposed social distancing at home. Approximately 11% kept a distance to their hospital or private practice because of the pandemic, potentially also related to a shortage of appropriate personal protective equipment [5].",

Second, our survey may not be absolutely well balanced, because all participants were members of the \u2018AGA-Society of Arthroscopy and Joint-Surgery\u2019 and, therefore, the majority of them might have a more sports orthopaedic interest. In other words, arthroplasty surgeons may have been underrepresented in our survey.",

Instead, it must be assumed that due to the fact that surgical treatment cannot occur in a timely manner also the final outcome is impaired (e.g. meniscal repair performed 3 months later than usual). For orthopaedics, the way ahead is not clear and may substantially vary between different countries. But, it is most likely that as soon as a decline of new COVID-19 cases will occur in a country, a cautious and gradual resumption of routine orthopaedic procedures will be initiated [4]. However, it is believed by the authors that orthopaedic surgery will not be able to return to a pre-pandemic level earlier than within 3 months.",
