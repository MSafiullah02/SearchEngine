Bisphosphonates-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) is a recently (last decade) described adverse side effect of bisphosphonate therapy.2 Patients who are receiving intravenous, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis, multiple myeloma or metastatic carcinoma to the skeleton are at greatest risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ). These patients represent 94% of published cases.2 The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure.2",

Clinically, the disease is characterized by exposed alveolar bone that occurs spontaneously or becomes evident following an invasive dental surgical procedure such as tooth extraction, periodontal surgery, apicoectomy, or dental implant placement.4,5 In 2003, several cases of ONJ were reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy.5\u20137 Since then, the number of reported cases has been increased, and the literature now includes several hundreds of cases.3 Bisphosphonate-associated ONJ (Figure 1) usually appears as areas of necrotic exposed bone surrounded by inflamed gingiva or mucosa.8 It usually has a significant adverse effect on the quality of life for most patients.9\u201311 Complete prevention of this complication is not currently possible. However, pre-therapy dental care reduces this incidence, and nonsurgical dental procedures can prevent new cases.12",

There is also no recurrence, although we used a minimally invasive nonsurgical regimen suggested by Moretti et al.15 This might be explained12 on the basis that bisphosphonates are highly concentrated in the jaws. Coupled with chronic invasive dental diseases and treatments and the thin mucosa over bone, the small capillaries within the bone become involuted, and the bone becomes avascular. A spontaneous breakdown of the overlying mucosa, some form of injury, or an invasive surgery to the jaws usually causes this necrotic bone to become exposed which then fails to heal. Ficarra et al.18 were the first to suggest antibiotic treatment associated with hygiene protocol, and the value of this therapy has been supported by more recent articles.19,20 These actually coincide with our results in using limited minimally invasive nonsurgical protocol, whereas extensive radical surgical resection rarely results in wound closure and sometimes contributes to worsening of the disease.21",

This can be explained on the basis that the uncertain outcomes of surgical treatment probably stem from the ability of bisphosphonates to bind hydroxyapatite and thus to be absorbed by bone, making it impossible to surgically remove the necrotic bone to a safe margin.12 In addition, surgery may create a bone wound that will not heal, because of the bisphosphonate therapy itself; secondary osteonecrosis may then develop from the surgical margins.15 In such cases, the postsurgical relapse of the pathology can create greater bone exposure and a worsening of the condition. The intrinsic risks associated with these surgical procedures, which are typically performed in patients who are already compromised by their oncologic pathology, should persuade physicians to limit surgical intervention to only those cases that are refractory to conservative management.",
