Our study investigated the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of 63 patients with COVID-19 in Beijing. Patients were classified into four groups, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mean age of our patients was 47 years of age (range 3-85) and there was a slight male predominance (58.7%). Thirty percent of our patients had severe or critically ill disease, but only 20% of severe and 33% of critically ill patients had been to Wuhan. Fever was the most common presentation (84.1%), but cough was present in only slightly over half of the patients. We found that lymphocyte and eosinophils count were significantly decreased in patients with severe disease (p=0.001 and p=0.000, respectively). Eosinopenia was a feature of higher levels of severity. Peripheral CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients, but there was only a nonstatistically significant downward trend in NK cell numbers with severity. Of note is that liver function test including AST, ALT, GGT and LDH were elevated, and albumin was decreased.",

Diagnostic criteria for COVID -19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China [4] . Various specimens including respiratory samples from throat swab or sputum, urine, blood or stool samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 following WHO guidelines for quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [5, 6] . Positive results of COVID-19 infection were defined as any positive test from the above specimens. Routine serial hematologic and biochemical tests were performed after admission, and the serum samples were screened for common respiratory pathogens, including antibodies to adenovirus, chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie virus A16, legionella pneumophila and mycobacterium tuberculosis and all were negative.
