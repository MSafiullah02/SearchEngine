            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) was originally isolated over seventy years ago, and was thought to cause a mild, self-limiting, febrile illness (Dick et al., 1952; Simpson, 1964). Not until the outbreak in the Americas in 2015 and 2016 was ZIKV identified as a cause of significant adverse pregnancy outcomes (Johansson et al., 2016; Melo et al., 2016). Before the definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in 2016, gestational arbovirus infection was not associated with birth defects. Spondweni virus (SPONV) is the closest known relative to ZIKV, but whether SPONV is an emerging threat to pregnant women and their babies is unknown. It was previously thought that SPONV was geographically confined to Africa and caused only mild disease in rare human infections, reminiscent of the consensus around ZIKV in the decades following its discovery, but recent data suggest that it may be spreading beyond Africa (White et al., 2018). SPONV may therefore be poised to harm pregnancies in new, immunologically naive populations. To do this, SPONV would need to fulfill two major criteria: it would need to be vertically transmitted and cause fetal harm, and be transmitted between humans by the urban mosquito vector Aedes aegypti, which is associated with large-scale outbreaks of related arboviruses.",

            "text": "The first identification of SPONV was thought to have occurred in 1955 in South Africa (Theiler and Downs, 1973; Wolfe et al., 1982). However, it was later recognized that SPONV was in fact isolated three years earlier in Nigeria, but was misidentified at the time as a strain of ZIKV because of serological cross-reactivity (Haddow et al., 1964; Simpson, 1964; Draper, 1965). Serological cross-reactivity with ZIKV and other flaviviruses likely still confounds accurate diagnostics today. As a result, only six well-documented clinical cases of SPONV infection have ever been described (Macnamara, 1954; Kokernot et al., 1957; Draper, 1965). It is likely that many infections have gone unrecognized\u2014serosurveys have detected evidence of SPONV infection in 10 countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa (Kokernot et al., 1965a, 1965b; Brottes et al., 1966; Ardoin et al., 1976; Wolfe et al., 1982). Still, these six cases indicate that infection with SPONV typically involves an acute, self-limiting mild to moderate febrile illness (Wolfe et al., 1982), but a subset (4/6) of cases are believed to progress to more serious disease, including vascular leakage and neurological involvement (Macnamara, 1954; Mcintosh et al., 1961; Draper, 1965; Wolfe et al., 1982; Haddow and Woodall, 2016); these symptoms resemble those of other infections common in the same regions (Haddow et al., 1964; Boorman and Draper, 1968; Wolfe et al., 1982). Nothing is known about the risks posed by SPONV infection during pregnancy in humans. Powassan virus and West Nile virus, ZIKV-related neurotropic flaviviruses, can infect human placental explants and cause fetal demise in mice (Platt et al., 2018). In addition, intrauterine infection with St. Louis encephalitis virus resulted in severe neurological outcomes in mice that was dependent on the gestational day of challenge (Andersen and Hanson, 1970). In pregnant mice whose type 1 interferon responses were blocked by antibody treatment, SPONV did not cause fetal demise, but the placenta and fetus were infected (Salazar et al., 2019).",

SPONV is considered to be exclusively mosquito-borne, but recent mouse experiments suggest that it may have limited potential to be sexually transmitted (Mcdonald et al., 2017)\u2014human cases of sexually transmitted SPONV have not been described. Whether SPONV could spill over into a human-mosquito cycle involving Aedes aegypti is unclear. One recent study suggested strains of Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus were all unable to transmit SPONV (Haddow et al., 2016). Overall, with only limited studies evaluating SPONV's pathogenic potential and vector specificity, there is little data to guide our expectations for the potential of SPONV to cause fetal harm and adapt to an urban or peri-urban transmission cycle involving Aedes aegypti and/or other human-biting mosquito species.",

We found that SPONV caused fetal harm, similar to what is observed from ZIKV infection in this model. Vector competence experiments showed that Ae. aegypti could transmit SPONV when exposed to bloodmeal titers that approximate physiological titers, while Cx. quinquefasciatus could not.

We sought to establish a model that was less immunocompromised than AG129 mice, and one in which transplacental ZIKV infection and fetal damage had been demonstrated (Miner et al., 2016; Yockey et al., 2018; Jaeger et al., 2019) to better understand SPONV pathologic outcomes during pregnancy. First, to confirm the route and doses that would result in productive infection, groups of nonpregnant, mixed sex 6- to 11-week-old mice lacking type I interferon signaling (Ifnar1\n-/-) were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) in the footpad with 103 or 102 PFU of SPONV strain SA Ar94 (this is the only strain used in these studies, so it will be referred to hereafter as SPONV); or 102 PFU of the highly pathogenic African-lineage ZIKV strain DAK AR 41524 (ZIKV-DAK) (Jaeger et al., 2019). Since contemporary SPONV isolates from Haiti do not exist, we used the only available low-passage isolate, SPONV strain SA Ar94. This strain is 98.8% nucleotide identical with the SPONV genome recovered from mosquitoes in Haiti (Genbank:MG182017). Serum was collected at 2, 4, and 6 days post-inoculation (dpi) to confirm infection and determine the replication kinetics of SPONV in nonpregnant Ifnar1\n-/- mice. We also collected and tested serum at 7, 14, and 21 days from mice surviving SPONV inoculation, because sustained vRNA loads were observed with the Ifnar1-blocking mAb model (Salazar et al., 2019). SPONV viral titer in the serum peaked at 4 dpi (Fig. 1\na), and in surviving animals there was no detectable viremia at 7, 14, or 21 dpi. Higher serum titers were observed in animals inoculated with the lowest dose of SPONV (102 PFU). We postulate that this could be the result of higher inoculating doses causing a rapid initial rise in viremia, which in turn induces a more robust immune response, leading to more rapid clearance of virus from the serum, but confirmation will require further studies. ZIKV-DAK viremia also peaked at 4 dpi and reached significantly higher titers at 4 dpi than either SPONV-inoculated group (one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test; SPONV 103 vs. ZIKV-DAK: p < 0.0001, SPONV 102 vs. ZIKV-DAK: p = 0.0004).",

Timed-mated dams were s.c. inoculated in the footpad on embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) with 102 PFU of SPONV or 102 PFU ZIKV-DAK. Based on our preliminary experiments with SPONV in nonpregnant animals, and the results from our past studies (Jaeger et al., 2019), we chose this dose to minimize the potential confounding impacts of maternal illness on fetal outcomes. We collected serum samples from dams at 2 and 4 dpi to confirm maternal infection. All dams were productively infected, with detectable viremia for all groups by 4 dpi (Fig. 2\na). ZIKV-DAK replicated to significantly higher titers at is4 dpi as compared to SPONV (Student's t-test p-value = 0.0008, t = 5.641, df = 7). Dams were monitored daily for clinical signs until the time of necropsy at E14.5, 7 days after inoculation. Mild clinical signs were evident in both SPONV- and ZIKV-infected dams at time of necropsy and included reduced activity, squinted eyes, ruffled fur, and hunched posture. Interestingly, clinical signs were milder in comparison to nonpregnant animals that received an equivalent inoculum dose, and none of the pregnant animals met euthanasia criteria.",

Similar to what we have reported previously with different strains of ZIKV (Jaeger et al., 2019), gross examination of fetuses and placentas at time of necropsy revealed overt differences among fetuses within pregnancies and with uninfected counterparts. In general, fetuses appeared either grossly normal or abnormal, defined as undergoing embryo resorption (Fig. 2b) (Flores et al., 2014). At the time of necropsy, we observed high rates of resorption from both ZIKV-DAK- and SPONV-infected pregnancies. Resorption rates from ZIKV-DAK- and SPONV-infected pregnancies were not significantly different (ZIKV-DAK: 76.92% vs. SPONV: 68.29%, Fisher's exact test, p = 0.457). Resorption rates for both SPONV and ZIKV-DAK were significantly higher than PBS-inoculated controls (p < 0.0001). Despite significantly higher maternal viremia observed at 4 dpi with ZIKV-DAK-infected dams, the fact that resorption rates did not significantly differ between the two groups indicates that both ZIKV-DAK and SPONV have a propensity to harm the developing fetus that is independent of the amount of replication in maternal blood. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the results described by Salazar et al. where no fetal resorption was observed (Salazar et al., 2019), maternal SPONV infection in our model resulted in high rates of fetal demise.",

This model has been used previously for assessing both ZIKV and SPONV pathogenesis during pregnancy, but does not result in fetal resorption (Miner et al., 2016; Sapparapu et al., 2016; Jagger et al., 2019) unless mouse-adapted ZIKV is used (Mclennan and Wheal, 1976; Richner et al., 2017; Hassan et al., 2019). Here, we treated C57BL/6 dams with 1 or 2 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb at E6.5 and challenged with virus on E7.5. Serum was collected from dams at 4 dpi to confirm infection, and all dams were productively infected with SPONV or ZIKV-DAK following treatment with either dose of mAb (\nFig. 2\nd\n).

Next, adhering to our previously established experimental timeline, dams were necropsied on E14.5 to assess and compare fetal outcomes. At the time of necropsy, we observed no significant resorption from either ZIKV or SPONV infected pregnancies, after either dose of mAb (\nFig. 2\ne\n), consistent with the results described by Salazar et al. observed after E6.5 virus challenge and E13.5 or E18.5 dam sacrifice (Salazar et al., 2019).

Still, it was possible that the phenotype observed in our more immunocompromised model was instigated by IFN-\u0251/\u03b2 signaling at the maternal-interface due to the single intact interferon allele from the wildtype sires (Casazza and Lazear, 2018; Yockey et al., 2018) and not a specific effect of infection with ZIKV or SPONV. To test this possibility, we inoculated Ifnar1\n-/- pregnant mice with dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) on E7.5. DENV is a flavivirus that is closely related to both ZIKV and SPONV and it is not known to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans. To examine whether maternal DENV-2 infection is sufficient to induce fetal resorption, we s.c. inoculated pregnant dams on E7.5 with 7.5 \u00d7 104 PFU of DENV-2. Prior to studies in pregnant animals we confirmed that this route and dose would result in productive infection in nonpregnant animals (Fig. 3\na). All dams were productively infected with DENV-2 with detectable vRNA loads at 2 and 4 dpi (Fig. 3a). Importantly, fetuses continued to develop as examined on E14.5, and rates of resorption were not significantly different when compared to PBS-inoculated controls (DENV-2: 11.1%, PBS: 4.8%, Fisher's exact test, p - = 0.665) (Fig. 3b). These observations confirm that fetal harm was specifically associated with ZIKV-DAK and SPONV infection, but because DENV-2 infected mice do not show clinical signs, we cannot exclude the possibility that the more severe fetal outcomes observed with ZIKV-DAK and SPONV are the result of poor maternal health singly or in combination with other causes of birth defects like direct pathogenic effects of the virus infection.",

SPONV titers in naturally infected hosts\u2014to which feeding mosquitoes might be exposed in nature\u2014are undefined. Therefore, we conducted our experiments with blood meal titers ranging from \u223c106-108 PFU/ml. We considered these doses to be physiologically relevant based on studies with DENV (50% mosquito infectious doses = 105.68-107.21 viral cDNA copies/ml) (Duong et al., 2015) and ZIKV (50% mosquito infectious doses = 106.1-107.5 PFU/ml) (Ciota et al., 2017). To assess vector competence, mosquitoes were exposed to viremic bloodmeals via water-jacketed membrane feeder maintained at 36.5 \u00b0C. Infection, dissemination, and transmission rates were assessed at 7 and 14 days post feeding (dpf) using an in vitro transmission assay (Aliota et al., 2016a, 2016b; Dudley et al., 2017). Ae. aegypti were susceptible to infection (10\u201339%) and had moderate transmission rates with all three bloodmeal concentrations (8\u201336%) at both 7 and 14 dpf (\nTable 1\n). Infection efficiency indicates the proportion of mosquitoes with virus-positive bodies among the tested ones. Dissemination efficiency indicates the proportion of mosquitoes with virus-positive legs, and transmission efficiency indicates the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among the tested ones. In contrast, Cx. quinquefasciatus were susceptible to infection (0\u20136%) and some of these infected mosquitoes had disseminated infections (2\u20133%). However, none of the infected Cx. quinquefasciatus were capable of transmitting virus by 14 dpf (Table 1). Ae. aegypti that had been exposed to ZIKV-DAK at the same time demonstrated that the assay was capable of detecting virus-positive mosquitoes at these bloodmeal concentrations.",

            "text": "SPONV is the flavivirus most closely related to ZIKV. It may be spreading beyond Africa (White et al., 2018), but little is known about its biology. The potential of SPONV to emerge and cause congenital infections in humans as ZIKV did depends on its capacity for vertical transmission in mammals and its ability to be transmitted by human-preferring mosquitoes like Ae. aegypti. To date, only limited attempts have been made to evaluate its pathogenic potential and identify potential vector mosquitoes, e.g., (Haddow et al., 2016; Mcdonald et al., 2017; Salazar et al., 2019). Here, we characterized congenital SPONV infection in a mouse model and evaluated vector competence for SPONV in two mosquito species\u2014Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus\u2014that feed on humans and are ubiquitous throughout the tropics. Cx. quinquefasciatus was evaluated primarily because SPONV RNA was detected in a pool of these mosquitoes during routine arbovirus surveillance activities in Haiti in 2016 (White et al., 2018). Our results demonstrated that maternal infection of Ifnar1\n-/- dams with SPONV caused significant fetal harm and is consistent with ZIKV infections in this same model. Importantly, we confirmed that outcomes were specific to SPONV and ZIKV infection, because we observed no fetal harm in dams infected with DENV-2. Although there are limitations regarding the translational relevance of this model, this same mouse platform\u2014coincident with epidemiological data (Rasmussen et al., 2016) and other lines of evidence\u2014is widely regarded as helping to establish a direct causal link between ZIKV and fetal abnormalities in 2016 (Miner et al., 2016). In the less severely immunocompromised anti-Ifnar1 mAb model of pregnancy, we show that although ZIKV and SPONV do not cause fetal demise, maternal infection still results in vertical transmission of virus. These results are consistent with prior studies using the anti-Ifnar1 mAb model to study ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy (Miner et al., 2016; Sapparapu et al., 2016; Jagger et al., 2019). Together our data show that infection with SPONV during pregnancy can lead to fetal harm, with varying levels of damage to maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. We therefore speculate that SPONV infection during pregnancy in humans poses a risk to the developing neonate, and suggest that clinicians in areas endemic for Ae. aegypti caring for non-ZIKV adverse outcomes consider the possibility of congenital SPONV infection. We also speculate that SPONV could follow in the path of other Ae. aegypti-transmitted arboviruses, because of our data demonstrating that Ae. aegypti\u2014which also transmits DENV, ZIKV, yellow fever virus, and chikungunya virus\u2014could transmit SPONV. Ae. aegypti is a highly domesticated urban mosquito that lives in close proximity to humans, feeds on humans, and lays eggs in containers made by humans (Gubler, 2011). As a result, Ae. aegypti thrives in conditions created by high population density in tropical cities and thus facilitates epidemic arbovirus transmission.",

            "text": "In this study we found that SPONV infection of nonpregnant Ifnar1\n-/- mice was nearly uniformly lethal. This finding mirrors observations from other studies using AG129 mice, which lack both type I and II interferon receptors (Mcdonald et al., 2017), and mice treated with an anti-Ifnar1 mAb to transiently abrogate type I interferon signaling (Salazar et al., 2019). Pregnant animals that received this anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment prior to SPONV inoculation showed infection of the placenta and fetus, suggesting vertical transmission, but not increased rates of fetal resorption, recapitulating and expanding on the results reported from Salazar et al. by including a 2 mg mAb dose and ZIKV infection groups (Salazar et al., 2019). In contrast, SPONV-inoculated Ifnar1\n-/- dams had significant rates of fetal resorption and severe pathology at both the maternal-fetal interface and in the developing fetus in our study, consistent with ZIKV-inoculated controls and with what we and others have reported previously for ZIKV in this model (Miner et al., 2016; Yockey et al., 2018; Jaeger et al., 2019). We speculate that the difference in outcomes between these two models could be due to type I IFN signalling at anatomic barriers like the placenta (Lazear et al., 2019). For example, anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment is systemic and therefore may not dampen type I IFN signalling in the placenta, whereas Ifnar1\n-/- dams have a more profound immune deficiency that manifests different tissue-specific effects (Yockey et al., 2018). Future investigation into the role of both timing and dose of anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment during fetal and placental development could help further illuminate these immune mechanisms during SPONV and ZIKV infection.",

It should be noted, however, that our Ifnar1\n-/- mice are on the same genetic background as our anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated mice: C57BL/6, therefore differences in outcome are not likely to be due to variation in host loci outside the IFNAR1 gene. The SA Ar94 strain used here was also used in previous mouse studies (Mcdonald et al., 2017; Salazar et al., 2019), though differences in culture and passage history could result in small, but biologically important, phenotypic differences. Regardless of these potential disparities in experimental approaches, broadly consistent results have been observed using these murine pregnancy models for ZIKV, including fetal harm and vertical transmission.",

            "text": "Despite similar fetal outcomes, SPONV and ZIKV may not necessarily utilize the same pathways or molecular mechanisms to harm the fetus. Histopathological analyses demonstrated significant fetal and placental pathology in SPONV- and ZIKV-inoculated groups as compared to PBS- or DENV-inoculated controls. But ZIKV-DAK-inoculated dams displayed the most severe histologic phenotype that corresponded with higher placenta and fetus titers in both pregnancy models (Fig. 2). SPONV histopathology was more heterogeneous and severity scores were reminiscent of what we have previously observed with congenital Asian-lineage ZIKV infection (Jaeger et al., 2019). The labyrinth zones of both ZIKV and SPONV placentas showed similar degrees of vascular injury/loss, such that, despite this heterogeneity, the final outcome of fetal demise did not differ between these two viruses. While SPONV fetal histopathology in the CNS and developing brain, as well as the detection of virus in fetal tissues, provide indirect evidence of vertical transmission, this does not preclude the possibility that SPONV-induced fetal harm was the result of placental insufficiency. Both vertical transmission and placental insufficiency can lead to fetal harm, and for ZIKV, placental insufficiency is now being recognized as a potential contributor to fetal harm (Hirsch et al., 2018; Walker et al., 2019). As a result, SPONV could still cause adverse pregnancy outcomes in the absence of direct infection of the fetus via pathophysiology at the maternal-fetal interface. Importantly, we only assessed outcomes following a single infection timepoint at E7.5 and infection outcomes may differ depending on the timing of infection (Jagger et al., 2017). More studies are needed to better understand antiviral signaling at the maternal-fetal interface and pathways these viruses exploit to traffic to the feto-placental unit to cause harm during pregnancies. Translational nonhuman primate models will be valuable for such studies.",

            "text": "SPONV's ability to spread and broadly infect new human populations depends on the mosquito vector that transmits it. One recent study suggested that strains of Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Cx. quinquefasciatus were refractory to SPONV infection (Haddow et al., 2016). However, the blood on which mosquitoes fed in these experiments harbored moderate SPONV infectivity of \u223c105 PFU/ml. For related arboviruses like DENV, it is known that the level of viremia is one of the most important determinants of human infectiousness to mosquitoes (Nguyet et al., 2013; Carrington and Simmons, 2014). ZIKV 50% mosquito infectious doses are in the 106.1-107.5 PFU/ml range (Ciota et al., 2017). If SPONV is similar, then bloodmeal titers of \u223c105 PFU/ml are too low to achieve mosquito infection. In addition, some studies have shown that freeze-thawing flaviviruses impacts mosquito infection and transmission rates (Miller, 1987; Ciota et al., 2017). As a result, we chose a virus dose that we estimated to be what a mosquito might encounter in nature based on previous studies with DENV and ZIKV (Duong et al., 2015; Ciota et al., 2017), the flaviviruses most closely related to SPONV. In addition, we prepared our infectious bloodmeals using fresh virus supernatant to avoid the confounding effects of freeze-thawing virus stocks. These experiments demonstrated that Ae. aegypti could be productively infected and could transmit SPONV\u2014 as indicated by infectious virus in the saliva, suggesting the ability to transmit to a vertebrate host. In contrast, Cx. quinquefasciatus were susceptible to infection but none of these infected mosquitoes were capable of transmitting virus by day 14 post-feeding. These data therefore suggest that the wild-caught Haiti mosquitoes likely contained trace amounts of viremic blood in their midguts indicating that they fed upon a SPONV-infected human or animal. Further, the Haiti data also are consistent with field epidemiological reports for which it has been difficult to detect DENV-, CHIKV-, and/or ZIKV-infected mosquitoes because of low infection rates in field-collected mosquitoes, even during periods of active human outbreaks (Dzul-Manzanilla et al., 2016; Grubaugh et al., 2017; Ramesh et al., 2019). Finally, we used only a single combination of mosquito and virus genotype. Vector competence of many mosquito species for certain viruses likely is governed by vector genotype x virus genotype interactions in genetically diverse, natural mosquito populations (reviewed in (Lambrechts, 2011)). These data at the very least argue for more studies\u2014both experimental and epidemiological\u2014assessing different SPONV-mosquito combinations.",

The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic underscores that RNA viruses can emerge unpredictably to cause human disease on a global scale. Characterizing viruses with potential emergence risk is a critical part of defending against future viral threats (Menachery et al., 2015; Goodin et al., 2016). The adaptation of SPONV to an urban or peri-urban cycle, involving Ae. aegypti and/or other mosquitoes in the Stegomyia subgenus (e.g., Ae. albopictus) should therefore be a public health concern (Musso et al., 2015). Given the continuing difficulties in differentiating between flaviviruses in diagnostic assays, understanding SPONV's prevalence in the expanding landscape of cross-reacting, co-endemic mosquito-borne viruses could also be considered a critical public health priority.",
