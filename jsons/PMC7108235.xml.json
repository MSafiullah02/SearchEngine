Among them, 11 (2.1%) specimens were positive for three targets, three were positive for two targets (NS1 and VP1), and three were positive for only a single target (two for NP-1 and one for VP1). Positive criteria defined that all three primer\u2013probe sets were positives with more than 10 copies of each target. RT-PCR results for other common respiratory viruses indicated that 80 (15.8%) specimens were positive for rhinovirus, 42 (8.3%) for influenza virus A, 19 (3.7%) for RSV, 4 (0.8%) for adenovirus, 2 (0.4%) for influenza virus B, 1 (0.2%) for parainfluenza virus, and 1 (0.2%) for coronavirus OC43. Among 11 patients who gave HBoV-positive specimens, two patients were coinfected with RSV and one patient with rhinovirus. Interestingly, one sample, which was not positive by conventional PCR, contained a mean of 8.2 \u00d7 104\n copies/ml of HBoV in real-time PCR assays. Considering all positive assays, the clinical specimen detection limit was around 10 genome copies.",

Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to identify HBoV infection in adults in Korea. Previously, Lu et al. (2006) reported that HBoV PCR-positive patients with pneumonia had a relatively low viral load.
