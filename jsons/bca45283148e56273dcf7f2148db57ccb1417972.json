It notes that coming in the wake of the ongoing HIV pandemic, the rights of those infected with Ebola to be identified and treated were largely uncontested. The questions of who would be treated, by whom, with what, remained however extremely contentious. The international response to the pandemic also saw, for the first time, not only non-state actors involved in mediating and mitigating a health crisis, but also military intervention. This chapter lays out both the uses and the dilemmas of military response. It explores the impact of these interventions in this Ebola pandemic, with a view towards possible future military deployments against health threats, and offers an initial analysis of the consequences thereof on the relationship between individual and state rights and responsibilities.",

One the hand, HIV and AIDS should have served as a warning of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), and on the other, Ebola had actually been recorded in West Africa before. Yet the outbreak still surprised and very quickly overwhelmed all levels of response: local, national and international. By the time it abated (small clusters of cases continue to be identified,), 28,639 people had been registered as infected, and 11,316 had died. 1 The 2014-2015 Ebola pandemic in West Africa morphed into a global crisis beyond health. Although locally concentrated, it demanded global intervention. The continued spread of the disease is subject to changing prognoses, contradictory reports, and deep angst. Fears pertain to medical as well political and economic implications. Ebola, and further emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), are associated with a host of negative consequences in terms of life expectancy and development in affected societies, states and economies, and also pose a threat to peace and security directly and beyond the region of West Africa. 2 The three West African countries most affected by the 2014-2015 EDV outbreak were Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

But most of all, the populations of West Africa are rampantly mobile. To have relatives that need regular visiting in nearby countries is commonplace, and people zip around, unimpeded by porous national borders. \"Ebola stood still for us in the past, and we could set up an operational machine in one area,\" explains Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist with MSF who has worked in all three countries during this outbreak. \"If you have a contact tracing system, what do you do when your contact picks up and moves 60 km away one morning without telling you? If Ebola moves from location A to location B, suddenly you need to duplicate everything.\" This explains a large part of why the control systems were overrun so quickly. 7",

Once the immune system recognizes the virus not as a sugar molecule but as an infection, it mounts an immune reaction which quickly becomes an overreaction. 8 As the body fights the virus, infection proceeds in two phases. Phrase one provokes symptoms of fever and muscle aches/cramps. Phrase two elicits the loss of bodily fluids, up to 5 liters a day. While previous Ebola outbreaks also featured haemorrhaging, 9 the 2014-2015 pandemic in West Africa was characterized more by vomiting, diarrhea and hiccups. The causative mechanism of the last symptom is unknown. An infected person either dies within ca. 3 days of exhibiting symptoms, or lives, taking roughly 13 days (after developing symptoms) to initially recover. The only known antidote, which sometimes helps and sometimes does not, is the provision of fluids. While different Ebola strains, during separate outbreaks, have had varying mortality rates, the average appears to be 50 percent. At death, the corpse harbors the highest viral load of the course of infection. Touching, or ritually cleansing the body is thus when most transmissions take place.",

This is despite the mounting clinical evidence that the infection can linger, causing long-term health complications, and can also be transmitted (notably through seminal fluid) months after someone has recovered from the infection. Furthermore, the longterm consequences and costs to social cohesion, to economic investment, development and productivity, (including impact on food security, for instance) and to political stability (where one state or subregion (re)gains investment and/or tourism while another does not) remain underacknowledged, underresearched, and underappreciated.

Instead, the private (NGO) sector, and international programs (such as through the UK's National Health Service, NHS) court have long trained technicians, nurses and doctors, and lured them from local health systems with lucrative contracts abroad. In the case of the NHS this is especially egregious, since the postcolonial structure of many African health systems means that medical staff trained there adhere to UK standards: so staff hired away do not need additional training or certification to be able to practice in the UK. Similarly, if intended to be more short-term, the German Government has an agreement with the Egyptian Government: the latter sends doctors to work in German hospitals, their salaries paid by the Egyptian Government. In both cases, the local (West African or Egyptian) health systems are left bereft of medical professionals. The host (national) health systems benefit, but little or no transfer of knowledge takes place. This leads to perverse situations wherein, for instance, there are more Malawian doctors practicing medicine in London than in Malawi; it is more likely that someone with malaria will be properly diagnosed in London or Frankfurt than in East Africa because of the concentration of expertise in identifying malaria symptoms. Given the high mortality rate for EVD in West Africa, this is likely to be the case with Ebola infection as well: that medical specialists in Atlanta and Madrid are attuned to Ebola, while no doctors are even available in, notably, Sierra Leone. 29 The world's wandering attention also means waning focus and funding for establishing and monitoring the supply chains of necessary surveillance, and medications necessary to keep Ebola, and other diseases, at bay.",

Taking local customs into account is vital for effective disease response. 34 The national response needs to take these social practices into account and to cue both the local populations, for instance by cooperating with local healers, 35 and external actors in order to render any response culturally palatable as well as medically and politically effective. In order to be politically and medically effective in turn, national governments need to realize, invest and negotiate the capabilities and capacities they require in order to anticipate, identify and react to infectious diseases, of which EVD is a case in point. This includes, at the national level, investment in the Global Outbreak Alert Response Network (GOARN), 36 the WHO system which draws on government information sharing, but also allows NGOs and social media platforms access in order to report and monitor, in real time, (im)pending disease outbreaks.",
