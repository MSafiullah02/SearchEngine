In Italy, as in the rest of the world, extremely rare cases of infection have been seen in the pediatric population. In a study carried out in China involving more than 44,000 cases of COVID-19, 0.9% of patients were between 0 and 10 years of age and 1.2% ranged in age from 10 to 19 years [1]. The absence of evident symptoms in children has reduced the need for nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab screening in this age group [2], with the result that little information is currently available on this segment of the population. During the pandemic period in Italy, we observed more than ten pediatric patients who tested IgG positive for Sars-CoV-2 with painful vasculitic skin lesions on the feet that required modest pain relief therapy. Here, we describe the case history of one of these patients and present pictures of her condition.",

In the pediatric population there are numerous clinical conditions of a predominantly infectious or immune-mediated origin that can be associated with hemorrhagic ischemic vasculitis. One of the most of these, Kawasaki disease, has already been correlated with COVID-19 [3]. Although it is not possible to correlate our patient case with the presence of SARS-COV-2 due to the swab negativity, we believe that the positive result for SARS-COV-2 IgG antibodies does correlate the skin lesion with COVID-19. This belief is reinforced by the fact that similar vasculitic manifestations associated with coagulation disorders, cyanosis and gangrene have been reported as late manifestations in severe COVID-19 cases in adults [4\u20136].",
