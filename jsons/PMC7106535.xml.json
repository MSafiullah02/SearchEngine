The initial ssDNA pool was heated at 90\u00b0C for 10 min, and immediately cooled on ice for 10 min, and then 5 \u03bcg of the DNA library was pre-incubated with 100 \u03bcL of Ni\u2013NTA sepharose beads in 100 \u03bcL of binding buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1% (w/v) BSA) for 30 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. The nonspecific DNA-bead complexes were precipitated and discarded. The pre-cleared supernatant was then incubated with 2 \u03bcg of His-tagged N protein in 100 \u03bcL binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature and 100 \u03bcL of Ni chelating sepharose (GE Healthcare) was added. The mixture was further incubated for 30 min at room temperature and washed five times with 500 \u03bcL of binding buffer. The N protein complexed with DNA was separated from the Ni chelating sepharose by adding 200 \u03bcL of elution buffer (binding buffer plus 0.4 M imidazole). The eluted supernatants of each round were precipitated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (PCI) treatment and then ethanol precipitation. Twelve sequential selection rounds were repeated using the same procedure. A more stringent condition was employed by reducing the protein concentration from round 8; 1 \u03bcg (round 8), 0.5 \u03bcg (round 9), 0.25 \u03bcg (round 10), and 0.125 \u03bcg (rounds 11\u201312) in 100 \u03bcL binding buffer. After the 12th round, ssDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into a linearized pGEM T vector (Promega). After subcloning and transformation into E. coli DH5\u03b1, plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones and the DNA sequences were determined. Bioinformatic analysis by ClustalW2 was performed to align the multiple sequences of the aptamers (18). The secondary structures of selected ssDNA aptamers were predicted using the MFold program, which was based on the Zuker algorithm (19).",

In these experiments, the absorbance at 492 nm increased significantly at round no. 11. After twelve cycles of selection, we obtained 15 different ssDNA aptamers, and the nucleotide sequences of these aptamers were determined (Fig. 2B). Subsequent bioinformatic analysis was performed by ClustalW2, and the ssDNA aptamers were classified into four groups and five unrelated individual ssDNA aptamers as shown in Fig. 2B. Groups 1\u20134 contained characteristic clusters of nucleotides in the 45 random sequence region (indicated by asterisk). In group 1, four different ssDNA aptamers were shown to contain three nucleotides (TTG) followed by GC rich conserved sequences in the 45-base random region. Groups 2 and 3 were shown to have (CTTG) followed by (CAGTTCG) and (CAATA), respectively. In addition, several nucleotides were matched in group 4, but it was difficult to identify any characteristic clusters of nucleotides in the five unrelated individual ssDNA aptamers.",

The N protein was immobilized on Ni-coated plates and various concentrations of the 5\u2032-biotinylated aptamer candidates were added. After addition of streptavidin-HRP, the absorbance at 492 nm was measured. The binding curve was fit to a hyperbolic equation based on Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics, and we were able to obtain the amplitude and K\nd value (Table S1). Of the 15 aptamer candidates, the K\nd values of two aptamers, named aptamer 1 and aptamer 11, that displayed high affinity were determined from the binding curve (Fig. 3\nA). Although both aptamers showed high binding affinities to the N protein, aptamer 1 (K\nd\n = 4.93 \u00b1 0.30 nM) exhibited a slightly higher affinity than aptamer 11 (K\nd\n = 9.02 \u00b1 1.89 nM). When we compared the K\nd values of the ssDNA aptamers with RNA aptamer (equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.65 nM), which was recently published (15), they were quite comparable. However, the nucleotide sequence and secondary structure of the selected RNA aptamer are different from the ones of our selected DNA aptamers. This suggests that the nucleotide component is not important for high affinity binding to the N protein. Therefore, proper binding to the protein might be more important for nucleic acid aptamers even though the exact binding site is unknown at present. In addition, the fact that natural RNA is very liable to digest by nuclease attack makes DNA a more suitable candidate for target protein detection. Based on the ELISA results, aptamer 1 was chosen for further bioinformatic analysis and the MFOLD program was used to predict secondary structures (Fig. 3B). In this analysis, the 45 random sequence region of aptamer 1 (shaded nucleotides) was shown to consist of a major loop with a small hairpin and base-paired nucleotides with the defined sequences flanking the random region. The GC rich conserved sequence, as described in group 1 aptamers, was also found to be located at the stem-loop region (indicated by black line).",

When various amounts of N protein (0\u201318.4 \u03bcg) were analyzed by Western blotting with 500 ng/mL of 5\u2032-biotinylated aptamer 1, we found that the band intensities increased as the amount of N protein increased (Fig. 4A). This indicates that the selected aptamer 1 bound to the N protein in dose dependent manner, and could be used as an alternative to antibodies for the detection of the N protein. We also performed a comparative Western blotting experiments with commercial His probe-HRP and Anti-N protein followed by secondary antibody conjugated HRP (Fig. 4B). The result showed that the band intensities generated using the anti-N protein and aptamer 1 were similar to each other (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 4B). However, the detection sensitivity was not significant when the His probe-HRP was used (lane 1 in Fig. 4B) under the reaction condition described above. Our results suggest that the ssDNA aptamer isolated in this study could be used as an alternative to the antibody for the detection of the N protein. Because aptamers can bind to specific target proteins with high affinity, they have been referred to as \u2018chemical antibodies\u2019. It is also worth noting that DNA can be synthesized easily while antibody generation relies on the immune system of animals. In addition, the fact that aptamers have higher stability than protein antibodies makes aptamers more useful in the development of diagnostic systems, such as viral infection and cancers (20).",

A random ssDNA library was obtained by PCR, which contains 45 random sequences, using 5\u2032-FAMTM labeled forward primer and 5\u2032-phosphorylated reverse primer, which was followed by \u03bb-exonuclease digestion. Ball symbol at the 5\u2032 end of the forward primer represents FAMTM. After eliminating non-specific binding to Ni\u2013NTA beads, the ssDNA pool was incubated with the His-tagged N proteins, which were immobilized on Ni\u2013NTA sepharose beads. Unbound DNA was discarded, and bound DNA was eluted by the addition of imidazole. The DNA was enriched after twelve cycles of selection, and the selected DNA was amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced.",
