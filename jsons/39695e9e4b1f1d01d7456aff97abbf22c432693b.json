Patients in CTP class B or C have less than a 60% 2-year survival and should be considered for OLT. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a more simplified and objective method designed to characterize the degree of illness of patients with end-stage liver disease. The MELD score incorporates serum bilirubin, prothrombin time, and creatinine values [1] . Based on its ability to predict survival, the MELD score has been used to prioritize patients on the OLT wait list. It is generally accepted that patients with a MELD score greater than 10 should be referred for liver transplant evaluation, and those with a MELD score of 15 or higher are most likely to derive benefit from OLT [2] . Despite its simplicity, the MELD score does disadvantage a subset of patients who have severely decompensated liver disease but minimally abnormal laboratory results. Recently, serum sodium has been incorporated into the MELD score, i.e., MELD-Na. Hyponatremia is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and diminished serum sodium levels may be a surrogate marker of advanced portal hypertension [3, 4] .",

Selected recipients with low MELD score and significant hepatic decompensation, HCC, or other complications of advanced liver disease such as primary sclerosing cholangitis with recurrent episodes of ascending cholangitis or polycystic liver disease are typically good candidates for LDLT. Conversely, patients with higher MELD scores and severe hepatic decompensation usually have limited survival and a shorter anticipated waiting time for transplant. As compared to patient undergoing DDLT, LDLT recipients may have a significantly higher rate of complications and need for retransplantation, although adjusted long-term survival appears to be similar [16, 17] . As such, careful recipient selection is critical. Contraindications to LDLT may include significant mesenteric vascular thrombosis, severe portal hypertension, need for simultaneous renal transplantation, or retransplantation. An additional consideration is matching donor and recipient body size. Specifically, a graft weightto-body weight ratio of 0.8% is recommended to avoid the development of small-for-size syndrome, a condition marked by the development of hyperbilirubinemia, intractable ascites, coagulopathy, renal failure, and extended duration of hepatic encephalopathy.

Traditionally, older donor age was considered a risk factor for graft failure, primarily based on increased risk for chronic vascular disease, significant comorbidities, and potentially more hepatic steatosis in elderly donors. However, more recent experiences suggest that donor age alone may not be a predictor of graft outcome. In fact, older donors even greater than 80 years old may be used with reasonable success if other donor risk factors such as hepatic steatosis and cold ischemia time can be minimized [23] [24] [25] . The use of older donors in recipients with HCV infection has traditionally correlated with increased graft loss.

Risk of HBV infection in the recipient depends largely on whether the recipient has immunity against HBV. Specifically, although infection rates are low in hepa-titis B surface antibody (HBsAb) positive/HBcAb+ recipients, they may be as high as 76% in recipients with both negative HBsAb and HBcAb [31] . As such, the recipient of a liver allograft from a HBcAb+ donor will usually receive oral antiviral medication with or without hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for prophylaxis. The use of lamivudine for prophylaxis has reduced the risk of infection to less than 4%, and the use of newer agents such as tenofovir and entecavir with lower rates of resistance may result in even lower infection rates among OLT recipients from isolated HBcAb+ donors.

Direct comparisons between tacrolimus and cyclosporine after OLT have revealed lower rates of acute rejection and improved patient and graft survival with the use of tacrolimus [39] [40] [41] . CNIs are associated with nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Alopecia and hyperglycemia are more often seen with tacrolimus use, while hirsutism and gingival hyperplasia are more commonly associated with cyclosporine. Patients with acute liver failure and decompensated cirrhosis with severe hepatic encephalopathy may be more prone to neurotoxicity from these agents. As such, introduction of the CNI may be delayed until the patient is awake. CNIs are metabolized by the cytochrome p450 system; therefore, their serum concentration may be affected by several other commonly used medications. CNI levels and drug exposure will decrease with concurrent use of certain antiepileptic medications, rifampin, alcohol, and St. John wort. In contrast, CNI levels and drug exposure will increase with the use of macrolide antibiotics, azole and triazolebased antifungals, verapamil, and grapefruit juice.",

The use of mTOR inhibitors within the first 30 days after liver transplant is discouraged due to the risk of hepatic artery thrombosis and impaired wound healing. Some studies suggest that early initiation of mTOR inhibitors within 90 days of OLT may lead to increased preservation of renal function [42] [43] [44] . The recommendation for concurrent use of a low-dose CNI is based on a higher risk of acute rejection for patients on mTOR monotherapy. Additionally, mTOR inhibitors do exhibit some antineoplastic activity and have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma after renal transplantation [45] . It is not clear that mTOR inhibitors improve long-term post-transplant recurrence risk in regard to HCC [46, 47] .

Early ACR does not seem to affect graft survival, but late ACR has been associated with an increased risk of developing chronic rejection and graft loss [52] . In many cases, the initial suspicion for ACR arises when elevated liver enzymes are discovered. Symptoms including fever or jaundice are less common, particularly if ACR is identified early. Liver biopsy is required to make the diagnosis of ACR, which is defined by a triad of mixed cell portal inflammation, endotheliitis, and ductulitis [53] . The majority of cases of ACR can be managed with corticosteroid therapy. Typically a high dose of methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg daily is given intravenously for 1-3 days with a subsequent taper. Patients with refractory ACR can be managed with either a second course of steroids or less often thymoglobulin. Thymoglobulin, a polyclonal antibody preparation directed against lymphocytes, is administered intravenously for up to 5 days with careful monitoring of white blood cell and platelet counts.

The liver produces the majority of the body's proteins and therefore has pivotal synthetic functions such as metab-olism and synthesis of amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, lipoproteins, plasma proteins like albumin, transport proteins, protease inhibitors, fibrinogen, clotting factors, and complements. The liver also serves as a center of detoxification, removing or degrading toxic components from the circulation. In order for the liver to accomplish these functions, the hepatocyte must extract nutrients, waste, and toxic products from the blood that circulate through the liver within its sinusoids. The liver is continuously exposed to dietary ingredients consisting of exogenous molecules and micronutrients, environmental products, and byproducts of the gastrointestinal microbiota. The blood from the gastrointestinal and mesenteric circulation enters the liver via the portal vein and mixes with oxygen-rich blood from the systemic circulation via the hepatic artery and ultimately drains into the liver sinusoids. It is estimated that 80% of the hepatic blood flow within the liver arises from the gastrointestinal tract through the portal circulation [58] . Therefore, hepatocytes are exposed to a mixture of portal venous and arterial blood. The sinusoids are lined with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that contain fenestrations to facilitate passage of the blood to reach the hepatocytes [58] . The hepatocytes are constantly exposed to foreign and immunogenic antigens and environmental toxins and those produced by the endogenous orointestinal microbiota. This constant exposure could result in untamed systemic immune activation; however, the liver plays a critical role in regulation and maintenance of immunologic and inflammatory homeostasis [58] .",

Their contribution to host immunity includes the production of complement and antimicrobial proteins, acute phase proteins in response to infection, and antigen presentation to T cells [58] . The liver is also a lymphoid organ with unique immunological properties. The liver-specific macrophages, known as Kupffer cells, line the luminal surface of the hepatic sinusoids and are an important part of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). The Kupffer cells in the liver comprise 90% of the body's tissue macrophages and make up one-third of the parenchymal cells in the liver [59] . Both the Kupffer cells and the hepatocytes contain pattern recognition receptors (PRR) which can bind to microbe-associated molecular patterns and damageassociated molecular patterns that originate from the gastrointestinal tract through the portal circulation [60] [61] [62] . These molecular patterns are then phagocytized by the Kupffer cells or hepatocytes and are removed and cleared from the circulation. These local processes of removal and degradation by the Kupffer cells and the hepatocytes serve a protective role to prevent systemic immune activation as a result of antigens and byproducts from the gastrointestinal tract [58] . These properties ensure an efficient innate defense against intestinal organisms and toxins and confer a particular capacity for preservation of immune tolerance. The normal liver is therefore considered to be immune tolerant or \"tolerogenic.\" This is best supported by the observations that liver transplant recipients can reduce and also wean their immunosuppressive therapy in up to 20% of the patients, compared to recipients of other solid organ transplant [63] .",

Additionally, a milieu of dysregulated systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine response can result in further organ damage, especially in cirrhotic patients with systemic infection or sepsis [57] . The immunopathogenesis seen in cirrhosis is quite complex and is outlined in Fig. 3 .1. In general, the clearance of bacteria and bacterial endotoxins by the Kupffer cells is impaired in patients with cirrhosis due to portosystemic shunting. The immunologic dysfunction associated with cirrhosis is further augmented by compromised liver synthetic function, malnutrition, stress catabolism, and also lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis are associated with alterations and/or deficiencies in all of the host defense mechanisms. In addition to depressed host immunity, these patients are at increased risk for exposure to healthcare-acquired infections due to their frequent need for hospitalization to manage the many complications associated with chronic and end-stage liver disease.",

            "text": "In recent years there has been an increased appreciation of the importance of the normal gut microbiota which contributes to both the host's metabolic and immunologic functions. The majority of the gut microbiota is comprised of obligate anaerobes within the phylum Firmicutes (specifically Clostridia spp. and Gram-negative anaerobes such as the Bacteroides spp.). In the bowel of healthy subjects, Gram-negative bacteria are present in relatively low numbers as compared with the obligate anaerobes, whereas with cirrhosis, the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria is more prominent. Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota are well recognized in patients with cirrhosis, with an increase in colonization by the Proteobacteria that are predominantly Gram-negative enteric bacteria [64] . Spontaneous infections with Gram-negative bacilli are common in patients with cirrhosis, and it is proposed that this is mainly due to bacterial translocation from the gas-trointestinal tract that has undergone alteration in the gut microbiota. Bacterial translocation occurs when bacteria or yeast migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes and into the portosystemic circulation [57] . In animal experiments, oral administration of radiolabeled E. coli was detected within the intestinal lumen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and the ascitic fluid in mice with cirrhosis [65] , supporting the possible mechanism of enhanced bacterial translocation that may also occur in patients with cirrhosis. Additionally, Gram-negative bacilli are demonstrated to be more efficient in translocating across bowel lumen when compared to obligate anaerobes in a murine experimental model [66] , providing further evidence for clinical observations that Gram-negative enteric bacilli are the most common cause of infection in patients with chronic end-stage liver disease and systemic infections due to anaerobes are seldom seen. Other factors that contribute to the bacterial translocation of pathogenic bacteria in cirrhosis include intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal permeability [64] . Intestinal overgrowth and alterations in the gut microbiota appear to correlate with the Child-Pugh score; higher prevalence of bacterial overgrowth has been observed in patients with Child-Pugh classes B and C compared with patients having class A liver disease [67, 68] . Moreover, intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been associated with a diagnosis of minimal hepatic encephalopathy and supports the use of nonabsorbable rifaximin in the treatment and prevention of hepatic encephalopathy in such patients [68] . It has also been shown that there is a higher bacterial burden of pathogenic E. coli in stool cultures in patients with cirrhosis and those with early-stage hepatic encephalopathy [69] . Normal hosts have tight junctions between mucosal and epithelial cells, which limit translocation of bacteria and bacterial products. Patients with cirrhosis have alterations in tight junction or desmosome proteins that compromise the physiologic barrier and may result in increased bacterial translocation [70, 71] . Additionally, intestinal bacterial access to the gut epithelial cells may be facilitated by deficiencies in IgA, bile lipids, and antimicrobial peptides that are notably observed in patients with advanced cirrhosis [64, 72, 73] . Therefore, changes in the gut microbiota, coupled with the increased intestinal permeability, particularly in cirrhotic patients with ascites greatly enhance the risk for bacterial translocation due to aerobic Gram-negative bacteria resulting in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and bloodstream infections.",

Patients with cirrhosis have depressed RES-Kupffer cell function, which can further promote translocation of bacterial pathogens and their endotoxins, thus reducing immune surveillance by the Kupffer cells/RES and allowing these pathogens access to the bloodstream [74] . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed on the surface of macrophages including Kupffer cells and can recognize and bind to bacterial products including endotoxins. Alterations in the TLRs and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 2 gene via minor genetic polymorphisms may result in decreased affinity of TLR for Gram-negative bacilli lipopolysaccharide further enhancing the risk for bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis [75, 76] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that simultaneous variations in the NOD 2 and TLR genes are associated with increased risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, as well as an increase in surrogate markers for intestinal permeability in patients with cirrhosis [77] .

Bactericidal functions of neutrophils are compromised resulting from decreased circulating cells in the peripheral blood due to splenic sequestration, decreased chemotaxis, and phagocytosis [88] . In patients with cirrhosis, neutrophils have reduced microbicidal activity owing to diminished intracellular superoxide production and myeloperoxidase activity [90] .

Severe, potentially life-threatening SBP that requires hospitalization often noted in patients with advanced liver disease may be associated with 31% mortality [59] . SBP is characterized by the spontaneous infection of ascitic fluid in the absence of an intra-abdominal source of infection. The pathogenesis of SBP is caused by bacterial translocation from the intestinal tract in the setting of portosystemic shunting. The most common organism isolated from peritoneal fluid is Escherichia coli. In a large series of 519 patients with SBP, the prevalence of culture-positive organisms included E. coli (43%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%), other streptococcal species (19%), other Enterobacteriaceae (4%), Staphylococcus species (3%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), and 10% were miscellaneous organisms [100] . Another study noted that in the setting of norfloxacin prophylaxis for SBP, viridans group streptococci were prominent streptococcal isolates followed by group B Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus bovis, emphasizing the increasing importance of streptococcal species breakthrough infection as a cause of SBP in patients receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis [101] . Guidelines and recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of SBP have been published and are updated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) [102] . After SBP, UTIs are the next common site of infection in patients with cirrhosis. As in other patient populations, urinary catheters are an important risk factor for such infections, and as expected, GNB are common causative pathogens.",

As patients with cirrhosis have both complement and B-cell defects, they are at increased risk for infections due to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Additionally, these patients are more likely to have concurrent bacteremia and have multilobar involvement compared with CAP in the general population [103] . The depressed cellular immune response associated with cirrhosis also places these patients at increased risk for legionellosis. These patients require frequent hospitalization, and therefore they are at increased risk for HCAP. Hepatic encephalopathy is a risk factor for HCAP, because these patients have decreased mental status and are at risk for aspiration of oropharyngeal contents that often are colonized by Gram-negative enteric bacilli. Empiric treatment for HCAP should include coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other drug-resistant GNB, as well as MRSA. Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk for aspiration events in the setting of altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy or excessive alcohol consumption, which places them at risk for lower respiratory tract infections [104] . Additionally, the periodontal disease that is seen in alcoholic patients provides a favorable environment for both anaerobes and Klebsiella pneumoniae colonization, which can lead to lower respiratory tract infection during aspiration events [67, 105] . It is well recognized that patients with chronic alcoholism are at an increased risk for community-acquired pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae; a study reported that alcohol abuse was also a risk factor for CAP and septic shock due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species [106] . It is important to note that the latter two infections are uncommon in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis unless these patients have extensive prior healthcare exposure including stays in the intensive care unit or need for mechanical ventilatory support; other risk factors include leukopenia or neutropenia.",

While this disruption in iron homeostasis is most notable in hemochromatosis, it has also been reported in patients with alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic hepatitis C infection. Cirrhosis is associated with decreased synthetic function, including the production of hepcidin, an important regulatory peptide for iron metabolism. In response to infection and inflammation, there is increased production of hepcidin, which decreases the availability of free iron, resulting in induced hypoferremia. The decreased levels of free iron by hepcidin have important antimicrobial properties, by creating an environment that does not support bacterial growth. Animal models of hepcidin-deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to infection with Vibrio vulnificus. Therefore, suggesting that reduced production of hepcidin in patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis contributes greatly to their susceptibility to specific pathogens [116] [117] [118] .",

Vibrio vulnificus is a Gram-negative, halophilic noncholera Vibrio species that is a common organism isolated from estuarine and marine environments and has been associated with gastroenteritis, skin and soft tissue infections with hemorrhagic bullae, and bacteremia resulting in severe sepsis and death. Impaired iron metabolism and increased iron availability appear to underlie the pathogenicity of V. vulnificus invasive disease [120] [121] [122] . Common coastal sites where V. vulnificus is endemic include the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf Coast. Most patients (90%) with V. vulnificus bacteremia have a history of consuming raw or undercooked shellfish specifically oysters, whereas skin and soft tissue infections are associated with the handling of raw seafood or direct inoculation due to recreational exposure to marine environment [84, 123, 124] . Gastroenteritis is the most common clinical manifestation, cellulitis with hemorrhagic bullae, and less commonly seen necrotizing fasciitis has also been reported. Patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis can present with primary V. vulnificus bacteremia associated with multiple hemorrhagic bullae and septic shock. In case series, V. vulnificus bacteremia carries a mortality of 40%, with an extremely poor prognosis in patients with septic shock at the time of presentation [83] [84] [85] [86] 125] . Therefore, it is recommended that persons with chronic liver disease should avoid consuming raw undercooked shellfish and exposure to marine water.",

Individuals with cirrhosis are known to have impaired immune responses, including altered T-cell-dependent functions, which may affect the sensitivity of MTb testing [142] . There is no gold standard for latent MTb diagnosis, and all current tests have questionable accuracy for immunocompromised hosts. However, they do have high specificity and, thus, are still a valuable tool for minimizing the risk of active tuberculosis infection for many patients after undergoing transplantation [143] [144] [145] . Although there is limited research on the use of these tests specifically in individuals prior to transplantation, 2013 guidelines from the American Society of Transplantation recommend standard TST for all transplant candidates, with consideration of a second boosting TST 2 weeks later for those who initially test negative; this can potentially reveal a positive test for patients with remote exposure [146] . IGRAs are also recommended as an alternative to TST and may be preferable for convenience at most transplant centers. The use of an IGRA for screening for LTBI is favored in the setting where a patient has received a prior BCG vaccine, as an IGRA is more specific than a TST in this instance. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT) (Cellestis, Australia) has been compared to the TST for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection in candidates being considered for LT, and of note, indeterminate QFT results were more likely in patients with higher MELD scores [145] . There is some evidence that the T-SPOT TB test (Oxford Immunotec Ltd) may have slightly higher sensitivity than the QuantiFERON-Gold In-Tube test [147] .",

A variety of factors are associated with an increased risk for bacterial infection. These factors include older age, length of preoperative stay, CMV infection, duration of surgery, retransplantation, volume of transfused blood products, preoperative MELD and CTP scores, bilioenteric anastomosis, technical complications (e.g., biliary leak, HAT), renal replacement therapy, and hyperglycemia [152] . Intra-abdominal infections are most common due to the technical nature of the surgery. The bile duct has no natural collaterals, being supplied only arterially, as opposed to the liver, which has dual circulation through the portal system. The biliary epithelium is thus more vulnerable to hypoperfusion during transplantation or resulting from hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). A 30-year review at one center found a 14% rate of biliary complications post-LT, including anastomotic and non-anastomotic strictures, bile leaks, and cholangitis. Elevated MELD, HAT, and elevated donor creatinine suspected to reflect altered metabolic factors at the site of anastomosis, which may impair healing, were all significant risk factors for anastomotic biliary complications [153] . Biliary complication may in turn lead to further infectious complications, such as hepatic and intra-abdominal abscesses. A 10-year retrospective study at a large transplant center diagnosed hepatic abscess post-LT at a rate of 4.8 per 1000 transplant patient-years [154] . In the same study, HAT was confirmed to be a significant predisposing factor for hepatic abscess. Management of infectious biliary complications warrants antibiotic coverage for enteric Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes, as well as healthcare-associated bacteria based on the patient's history. Source control may necessitate drainage, endoscopic intervention, surgical repair or in severe cases, retransplantation.",

            "text": "Recently, infections due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been identified in solid organ transplant centers. Although there are multiple patterns of carbapenem resistance, the majority of cases in the USA are due to type A carbapenemases -specifically carbapenemresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Rates of CRKP have been reported between 6.6% and 12.9% in patients undergoing liver transplantation, although 1 transplant center has noted a rate as high as 23% [172] [173] [174] . In general, the most common sites of infections due to CRKP in LT recipients include surgical site, organ space, HAP, and UTI [172] . Mortality associated with CRKP infections in LT recipients ranges from 18% to as high as 80% [172, [174] [175] [176] . Another cohort of solid organ transplant patients found that infection with CRKP was independently associated with higher mortality (HR 5.562 [CI 95% 1.186-26.088]) [177] . In addition to traditional risk factors associated with CRKP infections in other patient populations, pre-transplant colonization with CRKP can place such patients at an increased risk for CRKP infections following transplantation [175, 176] . Despite this risk, there are currently no absolute contraindications to exclude donors that are colonized with CRKP. Treatment of LT recipients who developed CRE or CRKP infections is quite complicated, often requires combination antimicrobial therapy, and can also be associated with drug toxicity. Agents that have been used include the polymyxins such as colistin, aminoglycosides, and tigecycline along with or without a carbapenem agent. Although fosfomycin can be considered for treatment of uncomplicated UTIs due to CRE, the intravenous formulation is not available in the USA. One case report of complicated extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia during early post-transplant period necessitated addition of IV fosfomycin as an investigational drug to a multidrug regimen [178] . The role of the newer \u03b2-lactamase agents such as ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem/vaborbactam is yet to be defined for the management of serious infections due to CRE and CRKP.",

In the USA, the estimated rates of VRE colonization, prior to and after transplantation, were 16% and 22%, respectively [179] . There is wide variation in the prevalence of VRE colonization in LT candidates and liver transplant recipients, depending upon the transplant center and the patient population studied, and ranges from 0% to 44% [180] [181] [182] . In a prospective surveillance study, pretransplant VRE colonization was found to be associated with an increased risk for VRE infections after transplantation and associated with higher morbidity as measured by ICU stay and length of hospitalization; however, VRE colonization did not result in increased mortality. On the other hand, the acquisition of VRE colonization post-LT was associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with LT recipients with no evidence of VRE colonization [183] . The risk factors that are associated with VRE infection include prior antibiotic exposure, prolonged hospitalization, interventional procedures or complications of the biliary tract, and surgical re-exploration [161] . Common sites of VRE infection in the LT recipient include intra-abdominal, organ space, hepatobiliary, surgical site, bloodstream, and the urinary tract. Mortality due to VRE infections in LT recipients has previously been reported to be as high as 82%; this was, however, at a time when limited treatment options for VRE were available [184] . The use of linezolid and daptomycin, agents that have activity against such drug-resistant bacterial strains, has improved patient outcomes, although a 37.6% mortality has been reported in solid organ transplant recipients treated with linezolid for VRE infections [185] .",

Current guidelines recommend stratification based on specific risk factors. Patients are deemed high risk for invasive candidiasis, if they have \u22652 of the following conditions: prolonged or repeat operation, retransplantation, renal failure, \u226540 units of cellular blood products, choledochojejunostomy, or Candida spp. colonization in the perioperative period [188] . In one series including 30 pre-LT candidates, 81% were found to have Candida carriage in gastrointestinal tract [199] . High-risk patients are recommended to be treated with an antifungal medication. Fluconazole 400 mg daily is sufficient for most Candida spp. coverage, though, notably, prevalence of nonalbicans Candida spp. have increased and such infections are associated with higher mortality in the immunosuppressed host [194] . Duration of antifungal prophylaxis may vary by transplant center; however, 4-week duration is common. Prophylaxis may be extended based on ongoing risk factors.

Multiple factors have been correlated with an increased risk of IA after transplantation. Retransplantation and the need for renal replacement therapy have the highest association [205] . It is theorized that injury to the hepatic reticuloendothelial phagocytes and alteration of platelet-mediated inflammation seen in patients with hepatic dysfunction increase susceptibility to tissue-invasive Aspergillus spp. infection [206, 207] . Renal failure may directly impact granulocyte and macrophage function or may be a marker for other predisposing factors in critically ill patients.

As a result of current screening and prophylaxis practices, many viruses such as HIV, CMV, EBV, HBV, and HCV are identified early during the procurement period of the donor, and therefore, appropriate graft acceptance, infection surveillance, and when applicable treatment can ensue in the recipient. Unexpected donor-derived infections, although uncommon, can be an important complication particularly in the early post-transplant period. In addition to routine pre-transplant screening of the donor whether living or cadaveric allografts by history and laboratory screening, the procuring surgeon should carefully inspect the organ and donor for signs of infection by thorough physical examination. Surveillance cultures are typically sent that include blood, urine, and sputum samples. Peritoneal cultures may be warranted in cases of enterotomy and ascitic contamination to guide postsurgical antibiotic coverage [218] . Active infection in the cadaveric donor is not necessarily an absolute contraindication for transplantation; targeted antibiotics often can mitigate the risk. However, decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Liver transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable to acquire bacterial infections via the allograft harvested from a donor with bacteremia; this possibly is related to the large tissue and vascular volume of the liver compared to other solid organ transplants [219] . Antibiotic prophylaxis may need to be extended in highrisk scenarios, such as donors with infective endocarditis and meningitis [220] . If an active bacteremia is diagnosed in the donor, the liver may still be used safely, provided that the donor has received appropriate treatment for the infection for 48 h and that the recipient receives at least 14 days of targeted treatment against that infection following transplantation [217, 221] . Guidelines suggest that for virulent pathogens that can cause endovascular infections such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2-4 weeks of antibiotic therapy should be considered although prolonged course of antibiotic therapy in recipients of such allografts has not been clinically validated [222] . Isolation of bacteria at a distant tissue site, such as in sputum or urine, usually does not necessitate antibiotic therapy in recipients of such donor allografts, with the exception of liver grafts from donors with confirmed or suspected bacterial pneumonia or pyelonephritis [222] . In some infections, such as severe encephalitis of unclear etiology, allografts are typically excluded outright [223] .",

Although donor transmission of any endemic mycoses is possible, donor screening for Coccidioides immitis is the only fungal serology that is routinely obtained in donors from endemic regions. Prophylaxis with an azole antifungal agent is recommended for LT recipients whose donor has a documented positive Coccidioides serology [226] . Recently, reports of infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans occurring in the early post-transplant period have raised possibility of potential donor transmission of the dimorphic fungal infection [226, [230] [231] [232] . Donor transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been well documented in the solid organ transplant population [217, 233] . Patients with active tuberculosis infection should not be considered for organ donation; however, latent tuberculous infection in a donor is not considered contraindication for organ procurement and transplantation.

As a result, donor screening with Strongyloides serology should be performed in donors from endemic regions such as tropics, subtropics, and Appalachia, USA; if serology is positive, recipients should be treated with ivermectin [234, 235] . Trypanosoma cruzi donorderived infection is more problematic in patients undergoing heart transplantation; donor serologic screening for T. cruzi should be considered for liver allograft donors from endemic regions including Mexico and Central and South America. If a donor is positive for T. cruzi serology, there is no clear contraindication for liver transplantation, as long as the LT recipient undergoes regular surveillance for parasitemia. Preemptive treatment with benznidazole is initiated for patients with a positive T. cruzi PCR assay [236, 237] .",

In LT recipients, the gastrointestinal tract is the most common site of CMV involvement and can present as esophagitis, gastritis, and enterocolitis but can also involve other sites such as the lungs [238] . CMV has a predilection to involve the allograft, and therefore CMV hepatitis is an extremely common manifestation in LT recipients and can sometimes be confused with allograft rejection [239] . The incidence of CMV infection in LT recipients varies depending upon the risk group studied, with rates of 18-29% overall; however, it has been reported to be as high as 65% in the high-risk donor-recipient mismatch (D+/R\u2212) [240] [241] [242] [243] . The use of CMV prophylaxis with ganciclovir or valganciclovir in LT recipients for at least 3 months post-transplantation has reduced the incidence in the D+/R\u2212 subgroup to 12-30% [241, [243] [244] [245] [246] . Historically, in LT recipients who do not receive CMV prophylaxis, CMV infection occurs within 3-6 months from the time of liver transplantation, which correlates with the period of maximal immunosuppression. However, in the setting of CMV prophylaxis, LT recipients can experience delayed-onset (also referred to as late-onset) CMV disease -after CMV prophylaxis has been discontinued -often occurring >6 months from the time of transplant [247, 248] . Delayed-onset CMV infection in LT recipients is more likely to cause tissue-invasive disease as compared to early-onset disease [248] .",

Chronic CMV infection, in the setting of immunosuppression, may be related to atrophy of the biliary ducts and the development of allograft arteriopathy that is seen with chronic allograft failure [253] . It is also postulated that as CMV can invade the vascular endothelium, it may be responsible for hepatic artery thrombosis [254, 255] . Finally, CMV infection can further augment the immunosuppression of transplant patients and places LT recipients at increased risk for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, as well as increased risk for EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) [256] [257] [258] .",

Initial infection is significantly more likely to cause symptomatic illness than reactivation [261] . There are two accepted strategies for prevention. Universal prophylaxis with valganciclovir is one approach and has the added benefit of prophylaxis against other herpesviruses. A duration of 3-6 months of prophylaxis is typical but may be extended based on clinical factors [262] . Alternatively, a preemptive approach utilizes weekly monitoring for CMV antigenemia or PCR, with prompt initiation of treatment for early replication; this strategy may be preferable for avoiding drug toxicity. There is no definitive recommendation of one approach over the other, although universal prophylaxis is preferred in highrisk transplantations -specifically CMV D+/R\u2212 allograft mismatches. A meta-analysis comparing the two in the LT population found no difference in the incidence of CMV disease. Using indirect comparison, there was also no difference in acute cellular rejection or mortality between the two groups, but a decreased incidence of graft loss with universal prophylaxis was found [263] . Treatment of CMV infection with either oral valganciclovir or intravenous ganciclovir in LT recipients is similar to other SOT recipients. Resistance to ganciclovir is rare, but more likely in patients with past prolonged use of ganciclovir [264] .",

Endemic fungi and Mycobacterial spp. including M. tuberculosis are also not uncommon pathogens during this post-transplant period. During the time of maximal immunosuppression (1-6 months after transplantation), reactivation of endemic mycoses can occur but oftentimes present later after transplantation and may be due to exogenous infection. Cryptococcus neoformans is the third most common fungal infection in solid organ transplant recipients, with an incidence that ranges from 0.2% to 5% [268, 269] . In general, cryptococcosis is a late infectious complication, occurring a median of 16-21 months after transplantation, although in liver and lung transplant recipients, it can present earlier -within 12 months post-transplantation [269] [270] [271] . The most common sites of infection are the lungs and the central nervous system, although cutaneous, liver, kidney, and osteoarticular involvement can also occur. Disseminated and extrapulmonary cryptococcosis has been reported in 50-75% of solid organ transplant recipients [271] [272] [273] . Liver transplant recipients have a sixfold increase risk for disseminated disease as compared to other types of transplant recipients [269] . The diagnosis and management of cryptococcosis in solid organ transplant recipients have been extrapolated from other patient populations (such as HIV) and retrospective/ observational experience and are available as practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the AST Infectious Diseases Community of Practice. Initial treatment with a lipid preparation of amphotericin B and flucytosine, followed by fluconazole maintenance treatment, is recommended [269, 274] .",

All of these infections can occur as a result of reactivation or as an exogenous new infection. Histoplasma capsulatum is a soil-based pathogen which has been well recognized to be endemic in the Ohio-Mississippi River Valley region of the USA. Histoplasmosis is a relatively uncommon infection in solid organ transplant recipients, with an incidence of <1%, even in endemic regions. Histoplasmosis usually presents within the first 2 years after transplant, but there can be wide variability regarding the time of presentation [275] [276] [277] [278] . In solid organ transplant recipients, it presents as progressive disseminated histoplasmosis that includes pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations such as hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and gastrointestinal and mucosal involvement. Coccidioidomycosis is endemic in the southwestern states including Southern California, as well as Mexico, and Central America. Most cases occur within the first year of transplant, with a reported incidence of 1.4-6.9% in endemic regions [279] . Due to depressed cellular immunity in solid organ transplant recipients, severe pneumonia, as well as dissemination to skin, bones, joints, meninges, and organ allograft can occur [280] [281] [282] [283] . Patients with a prior history of coccidioidomycosis or a positive Coccidioides serology prior to transplantation should receive fluconazole prophylaxis after transplantation [280] . The endemic regions for blastomycosis include the Midwest, south central and southeastern regions of the USA, and provinces of Canada along the waterways. Blastomycosis is rare in solid organ transplant recipients, and an incidence of only 0.14% was noted over a 16-year observational period [284] . The treatment for the endemic mycoses includes a lipid preparation of amphotericin B and the azoles, and recommendations and guidelines for the diagnosis and management have been established [280] .",

            "text": "Beyond 6-12 months, graft function has ideally stabilized, and immunosuppressive medications can slowly be minimized. This decreases the net state of immunosuppression and consequently the risk of opportunistic infections; however, there is always some ongoing risk. Infections during this phase are typically community-acquired. A 5-year study at a large transplant center found a prevalence of 183 hospitalizations for infectious complications post-LT, with 145 (79%) occurring in the post-6-month period. The same study found respiratory infections to be the most frequent etiology overall for solid organ recipients, accounting for 26.9% of late infections. The next most common etiologies were sepsis/bacteremia (13.1%), liver/biliary tract (12.4%), genitourinary (12.2%), CMV (7.5%), and fever of unknown origin (8%) [286] . Community-acquired infections in posttransplant patients may also present with more severe clinical manifestations [287] . Less common pathogens, such as fungi, parasites, and mycobacteria, are also seen in the post-6-month period, sometimes related to diminished vigilance for environmental exposure prevention over time. Infections due to Nocardia spp. are relatively uncommon, with an overall incidence of 0.7-3.5% in solid organ transplant recipients and only a reported incidence of 0.1% in LT recipients [288] [289] [290] . The median time to the onset of Nocardia infection in a European cohort was 17.5 months after transplantation, and infection was associated with corticosteroid use, tacrolimus use, and elevated calcineurin trough levels within the preceding month; interestingly, the use of TMP/SMX was not protective [291] . Recently there has been an emergence of non-Aspergillus mold infections in the solid organ transplant patient population. The occurrence of these mold infections can have a bimodal distribution, and in one study, 37.8% occurred within 6 months of diagnosis, and 33% occurred >2 years from the time of transplantation. In that same study, the median time to development of an invasive mold infection in the LT recipients was 81 days [292] . The most common non-Aspergillus molds were the Mucorales, Fusarium spp., and Scedosporium spp. The most common sites of infection for these molds were the lungs, sinuses, skin, and dissemination to the central nervous system. The dematiaceous molds that include Exophiala, Alternaria, Dactylaria, Curvularia, Cladophialophora, Verruconis gallopava, and others have been reported in the solid organ transplant populations as case reports and small case series [293] . This group of molds most often manifests as skin and soft tissue infections but can disseminate to the central nervous system. In one case series, the median time to onset was 22 months after transplantation, and the cutaneous presentation was associated with a good outcome [294] . Viral infections associated with the presence of chronic immunosuppression can also occur and include late-onset CMV infection, EBV-associated PTLD, JC virus infection associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and HHV-8 infection associated with Kaposi's sarcoma. Liver transplant recipients have an intermediate risk for the development of EBV-associated PTLD as compared to other solid organ transplant recipients. One center reported an incidence of PTLD in 6.3% of their pediatric LT recipients and an incidence of 1.2% in the adult LT recipients [295] . The cumulative incidence of PTLD in LT recipients has been estimated to be 1-2% over 5 years [296] . The highest risk factors for EBV-associated PTLD is due to primary infection as a result of an EBV D+/R\u2212 mismatch, in addition to a higher level of immunosuppression [297] . While the majority of cases occur within 1 year of transplantation, a 0.25% incidence has been noted in LT recipients at 1 year. Guidelines and recommendations have been established for the monitoring, diagnosis, and management of EBVassociated PTLD [298] .",

Treatment of active MTb in all solid organ recipients poses a challenge for drug dosing, due to the strong interaction between rifampin (and other rifamycins) and calcineurin inhibitors or rapamycin. For LT recipients in particular, the likelihood of drug-induced hepatotoxicity is increased, warranting careful medication management [298] . Substitution of one or more first-line drugs may be needed, based on the liver function at baseline and during the course of treatment; frequent lab monitoring and consultation with a MTb expert is advised [143] . Directly observed therapy is generally preferred for transplant recipients and is vital when alternative regimens are employed. Some experts recommend a minimum 9-month treatment course for all solid organ transplant patients, due to a concern for increased mortality with shorter courses [299] .",

Although most patients with HAV experience a selflimited course, acute liver failure may develop in less than 1% of infected individuals. Patients over 50 years of age and those with other chronic liver diseases are at higher risk to develop fulminant liver failure [319] . Accordingly, it is generally recommended that patients with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, should be vaccinated in the pretransplant setting. Despite vaccination, a subset of anti-HAV IgG+ patients may lose anti-HAV IgG antibodies within the first 2 years after liver transplantation [320] . Whether loss of the anti-HAV IgG antibodies correlates with true loss of immunity and need for booster immunization(s) remains unclear. HAV vaccine is safe to administer in the post-transplant setting, although serologic response is often lower than seen in patients vaccinated prior to undergoing allograft transplantation [321] . Assuring receipt of two vaccine doses and deferring vaccination to a later time when the patient is on a lower level of immunosuppression may improve serologic response in patients requiring further vaccine doses after transplantation [322, 323] . The specific implications of HAV infection in patients undergoing liver transplantation are not well described. However, as this patient population tends to be older, and may develop chronic liver disease following OLT, the risk for severe HAV infection may be greater. Additionally, chronic drug-induced immunosuppression may promote HAV replication by subverting hosts' immune surveillance.",

Specific immunosuppressive medications may correlate with risk of HEV persistence in transplant patients. In vitro studies have demonstrated increased HEV replication in the setting of tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and mTOR inhibitors [336, 337] . However, in one clinical study, liver or kidney transplant recipients who developed chronic HEV infection were more likely to have been on tacrolimus rather than cyclosporine [123] . In contrast, in vitro studies have demonstrated that mycophenolate mofetil reduces HEV replication, and this finding has been correlated in a clinical study where heart transplant patients taking mycophenolate mofetil were more likely to clear post-transplant HEV infection [338] . Corticosteroid use does not appear to affect HEV replication [129] .",

In solid organ transplant recipients, ribavirin at a dose of 8 mg/kg given for at least 3 months can lead to sustained virologic response in the majority of patients [339] . Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function and during the course of therapy if patients develop medication-induced anemia. Smaller studies have demonstrated that PEG-interferon alpha over a 3-12 month period may lead to viral clearance, although treatment is associated with significant adverse effects and may precipitate graft rejection [340, 341] .",
