Therapies targeting specific components continue to be explored, but none have proven to be efficacious thus far (including during the current COVID pandemic).

At this time, in the absence of more specific labs, the clinician\u2019s challenge of evaluating patients and making the most appropriate treatment decisions must mainly be guided by the clinical parameters, as determined by currently available resources and evidence.",
