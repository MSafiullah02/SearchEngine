However, one must understand why some apparently healthy infants and children proceed from initial infection to severe lower respiratory tract disease, whereas others experience a relatively mild, self-limited illness. Several groups have recently identified normal genetic variation among humans as a major factor in disease severity. Specific alleles of interleukin (IL)-4 [5] and the IL-4 receptor [6] were identified that are associated with more severe disease, and promoter variants of IL-10, IL-9, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) genes probably also influence disease severity [7]. Variations at the IL-10 gene locus are associated with a severe form of disease [8]. Ample evidence also exists for a relationship between a locus on the IL-8 gene and disease severity [9], [10].",

In light of this mounting evidence for specific genetic contributions to RSV disease severity and the possibility that similar or related genetic variation may underlie predisposition to asthma (and the link between respiratory virus infection and asthma [14]), understanding the mechanisms whereby these gene alterations influence pathogenesis will be critical. Early identification of vulnerable individuals could allow for targeted use of prophylactic strategies to protect those genetically at risk, as is currently practiced only for infants with abnormal underlying conditions. These preventative strategies could impact not only the morbidity and mortality of ARI but also the incidence of reactive airway disease.",

Although transfer of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to na\u00efve mice resulted in accelerated viral clearance, immunopathology was also enhanced in mice with very active CTLs [23], indicating that CTLs associated with Th1-type responses also contribute to the immunopathology observed in RSV-infected mice.

Regulation of the response of T lymphocytes to RSV may be critical in determining the clinical outcome of RSV infection. Abnormal T-cell regulatory mechanisms may be related to a hyperactive IgE response, which contributes to an enhanced lung infiltrate [28], [29]. Several proinflammatory cytokines detected in respiratory secretions from RSV-infected individuals, including IL-8, RANTES, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1\u03b1), mediate neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis, and these cell types can promote host defense and tissue damage. The contribution of Th1 cells to RSV disease in humans is supported by the findings that interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) is a prevalent cytokine produced by RSV-specific T-cells, and that the presence of IFN\u03b3 [30] and the levels of MIP-1\u03b1 [31], rather than levels of Th2 cytokines, have been shown to correlate most closely with RSV disease severity.",

The intense inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs of vaccinated children suggested an immunopathologic cause of enhanced disease. Animal models have been used successfully to study the immune correlates of pathology and the basis for enhanced disease [29]. The overexuberant inflammatory response, with lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration, has been ascribed to an imbalance in the ratio of Th1 to Th2 cells that could have resulted from poor preservation of F during formalin inactivation [33].

The presence of IL-5 correlated with an eosinophilic infiltration in the mouse lung. In contrast, priming with live RSV resulted in a Th1 pattern of cytokine production and prevented subsequent enhanced disease [36]. A recent study in mice suggests that immune complexes that fix complement also play a key role in the pathogenesis of enhanced disease; the augmented disease in mice is mediated by these immune complexes and abrogated in complement component C3 and B cell\u2013deficient mice [37]. The bronchoconstriction component of the enhanced disease seems to be mediated by complement, whereas the enhanced pneumonia component of disease depends on Th2 effects.",

Live-candidate attenuated RSV vaccines were never observed to cause enhanced RSV disease, and intranasal vaccination with live virus vaccines elicit better mucosal immunity than parenterally administered inactivated virus vaccines. Therefore, developing live attenuated vaccines for RSV-na\u00efve populations, including infants, is a priority. However, live attenuated vaccines pose the challenge of finding a balance between overattenuation, with subsequent induction of inefficient immunologic responses, and underattenuation, which may result in disease especially in younger infants. It is therefore heartening to report that recent advances in molecular virology have allowed a live attenuated vaccine candidate to be developed that is well tolerated in infants and protects against challenge [40].",

Administration of a second dose of this vaccine showed restriction of viral replication, proving that this vaccine could induce protective immunity. Consistent with the mechanisms of natural immunity, the antibody responses to this live attenuated virus were not the primary mediators of protection induced by the vaccine. Thus, rA2cp248/404/1030SH seems to be the first RSV vaccine candidate that is appropriately attenuated for young infants, including infants 1 to 2 months of age. Although half of the youngest infants did not show antibody responses, the limited replication of the second dose suggests that the infants were protected, which is critical because these infants are the most vulnerable and have presented the most challenges to vaccine development.

One viral surface glycoprotein, the fusion protein (F), has been used as the antigen for developing subunit vaccines (purified F protein [PFP]-1, PFP-2, and PFP-3). These F subunit vaccines have been shown to be moderately immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy seropositive children older than 12 months, children older than 12 months who have cystic fibrosis, and children older than 12 months who have chronic lung disease of prematurity. A meta-analysis of PFP-1 and PFP-2 studies suggested that these vaccines reduced the incidence of RSV infections but not lower respiratory tract infection [44]. The PFP-2 vaccine may show more promise in pregnant women; in a recent trial, it produced fourfold increases in neutralizing antibody titers in mothers and infants at birth and at 2 months of age [45]. Another subunit vaccine candidate is BBG2Na, a peptide from the G (receptor-binding) glycoprotein of RSV that is conjugated to the albumin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G [46], [47]. This vaccine is well tolerated, induces neutralizing antibody responses in healthy young adults, and is immunogenic in elderly individuals. Finally, subunit vaccines containing copurified F, G, and M proteins formulated with an alum adjuvant are being investigated [38], [48].

The RSV F (fusion) glycoprotein, like the F of all paramyxoviruses, mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes during infection [53], [54]. The F protein forms a trimer during synthesis and is cleaved during transit to the cell surface to produce the final membrane-distal and membrane-anchored subunits. The carboxyl terminal of the membrane-anchored subunit of paramyxovirus F proteins is anchored to the viral membrane, whereas the newly exposed amino terminal contains the fusion peptide that inserts into target membranes during fusion, which occurs at neutral pH [55]. Initially, the paramyxovirus fusion peptide lies deep within the hydrophobic core of the F protein, and for the virion to fuse with the target membrane and effect viral entry, the F protein must undergo an activation step exposing the fusion peptide [56]. For the paramyxovirus HPIV-3, the authors found that the F protein is activated when the adjacent receptor-binding protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), binds to a sialic acid\u2013containing receptor, permitting fusion to occur. On receptor binding, the receptor-binding protein triggers F to fuse [57], [58] but must interact with its respective receptor for fusion to occur [53], [57], [59], [60], [61].",

The ectodomain of the membrane-anchored subunit of F protein contains two hydrophobic domains: the fusion peptide that inserts into the cellular target membrane during fusion and the transmembrane-spanning domain. The fusion peptide is adjacent to the N-terminal heptad repeat (HRN) and the transmembrane domain is adjacent to the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC). The transient intermediate of F that is anchored to viral and cell membranes is believed to refold and assemble into a fusogenic six-helix bundle (6HB) structure as the HRN and HRC associate into a tight complex with N- and C-peptides aligned in an antiparallel arrangement. The refolding relocates the fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor to the same side, pulling the viral and cell membranes into close proximity and driving fusion [62].",

However, as with RSV, disease severity is often probably increased, and the pathology of clinical disease actually caused, by the inflammatory response rather than the cytopathic effects of the virus. This fundamental concept is highlighted by the fact that virus titers in the infected hosts are generally waning when disease symptoms become apparent [2] and that virus titer does not correlate with the severity of lower respiratory disease.

Experimental infection of the cotton rat with HPIV-3 leads to infection of bronchiolar epithelial cells, bronchiolitis, and interstitial pneumonia, mimicking human disease and making it a relevant model for HPIV-3 lower respiratory infection [87]. The authors studied cotton rats infected with either wild-type HPIV-3 or variant viruses containing HN molecules with individual mutations that conferred high receptor-binding avidity or low neuraminidase (receptor-cleaving) activity [88]. The infected animals experienced normal clearance of the variant viruses as opposed to the wild-type viruses; however, each of the HN protein alterations led to striking differences in the ability of HPIV-3 to cause extensive disease in the cotton rat lung. The variants caused alveolitis and an interstitial infiltrate, whereas the wild-type virus only caused peribronchiolitis, and the enhanced disease caused by the HN variants was manifested by greatly increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in the alveoli and interstitial spaces in the lung. This finding suggested that the differences between variants were caused by modulation of the inflammatory response through the different HN protein activity of the variants, and are dissociated from viral replication or infectivity. The authors hypothesize that mutations in the HN protein that alter either its affinity for receptor or its receptor-cleaving activity may modify the nature of the inflammatory response of the host. By using HN variants to dissect the etiology of enhanced disease it may be possible to identify which component(s) of the immune system's response to HPIV3 contributes to disease. Experiments are underway to determine whether HPIV-3 HN protein alterations that enhance disease specifically alter chemokine expression. The results will provide information that could be used to develop therapies to modulate an overactive inflammatory response after HPIV infection.",

One is a live-attenuated bovine parainfluenza type 3 (BPIV-3) vaccine, and the other is a vaccine based on a cold-adapted attenuated strain. The BPIV-3 vaccine is attenuated in humans by nature of host range. The bovine virus itself, when used to infect humans, was well tolerated but did not induce similar levels of antibody titers seen in infection with the human virus. Therefore, the reverse genetics approach was used to generate a set of HPIV-3 variants that carry individual genes from the bovine virus (chimeric viruses). These strains elicited an improved antibody response and, in monkeys, protected against HPIV-3 infection. Two of the chimeric viruses, one containing the HN gene from the bovine virus in a human virus background and the other containing the F and HN glycoprotein genes from the human virus in the bovine virus background are now viewed as the strongest vaccine candidates for human trials [96], [97], [98]. The latter candidate combines the host range restriction of BPIV-3 with the major antigenic determinants of HPIV-3, permitting efficient replication in vitro (which is beneficial for vaccine development) along with host range phenotype and excellent antigenicity. The bovine/human chimeric approach is also being used to create a strategy for vaccinating simultaneously against HPIV-3 and RSV, and possibly also HMPV. The chimeric virus that contains the HPIV-3 F and HN glycoprotein genes in the BPIV-3 background was engineered to also express protective antigens to RSV and HMPV, and this strategy will lead to bivalent vaccines against HPIV-3/RSV or HPIV-3/HMPV using a single virus. The BPIV-3/HPIV-3 chimera that also expresses RSV F is in clinical trials.",

Because binding and fusion are critical steps for infection to proceed, interfering with these critical processes at the entry stage of the viral lifecycle would prevent disease. The HPIV-3 F protein was found to be fully activated only when the adjacent receptor-binding protein HN binds to sialic acid\u2013containing receptor, permitting fusion to occur. On receptor binding, HN actively triggers F to fuse [57], [58], [61]. This mechanism is true for most paramyxoviruses [56]. The receptor-binding protein of these viruses, including HPIV-1 and HPIV-2, RSV, measles virus, Hendra virus, and Nipah virus, must interact with its respective receptor for fusion to occur [53], [57], [59], [60], [61].",

First, based on a recent analysis of the F-triggering process, peptides corresponding to the HR domains of F (see Fig. 1) can be designed to prevent the F protein from reaching its fusion-active state (Fig. 2C). The authors are performing computational modeling, based on the three-dimensional structure of the related parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5, previously called Simian Virus 5 or SV5) F [109], to predict which peptides will be most active, and will then test these predictions experimentally. This strategy has been effective at improving the design of antiviral peptides for paramyxoviruses [71]. Preliminary studies in the authors' laboratory also suggest that the normal triggering process may be subverted, causing the F protein to become activated before it reaches the target host cell and incapacitating F before it can mediate viral entry. The authors have shown that specific mutations in the stalk region of HN affect HN's ability to trigger F protein [57], and that specific features of the globular head region of HN modulate this triggering function [61]. However, how the signal for activation is transmitted from HN to F protein is unknown. For example, if HN's receptor binding induces a conformational change in HN, how does this change lead to activation of F?

As a result, live attenuated virus vaccine development for HPMV is already in progress. Recombinant HMPV strains were generated, representing rescue of strains from Canada (strain CAN97-83) and the Netherlands (strains NL/1/00 and NL/1/99) entirely from cDNA [121]. Several chimeric viruses were generated that are considered suitable vaccine candidates. For example, HPMV viruses in which several individual genes (the small hydrophobic protein gene SH, the receptor-binding protein gene G, or the M2 gene) or open reading frames were deleted were assessed for their ability to replicate and their efficacy as intranasal vaccines in African green monkeys [122]. Each gene-deletion recombinant virus, although highly attenuated, was also very immunogenic and protected the monkeys against challenge with HMPV. Two of these viruses (G-deleted and M2-deleted) are promising vaccine candidates [122]. In a different recombinant approach, chimeras were generated by replacing the nucleoprotein or phosphoprotein (P) open reading frame of HMPV with the corresponding gene from the avian metapneumovirus subgroup C [123]. When tested in African green monkeys immunized intranasally and intratracheally, both chimeras were comparable to wild-type HMPV in their immunogenicity and protective efficacy, and the P chimera, although it exhibited excellent growth in vitro (making it feasible for vaccine development) was also highly attenuated. Thus, the P chimera could be a superb vaccine candidate that combines good growth in vitro with attenuation in vivo and excellent protection in a primate model [123]. Candidate vaccines will probably emerge from clinical trials fairly soon, underscoring the importance of recent advances in molecular virology of respiratory viruses in accelerating clinical vaccine development.",

Receptor identification was performed using the new technology of pseudotyping viruses, in which the surface proteins of one virus can be incorporated into the membrane of another viral particle (eg, HPIV-3 glycoproteins in a retrovirus particle). Thus, binding and entry assays can be performed using the well-characterized and molecularly malleable retrovirus particle. The pseudotype allows engineering of any desired variant of the viral envelope protein being studied, and provides reporter assays for assessment of the envelope protein's ability to mediate binding, fusion, and entry. To identify the HCoV-NL63 receptor, the HCoV-NL63 spike (S) protein was incorporated into the membrane of retroviral particles to analyze cell tropism and receptor engagement of HCoV-NL63 [131]. The NL63 S protein was found to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS\u2013coronavirus, and to use ACE2 as a receptor for infection of target cells. Potent neutralizing activity directed against HCoV-NL63's S protein was detected in most sera from individuals aged 8 years or older, suggesting that HCoV-NL63 infection of humans is commonly acquired during childhood. The facts that SARS\u2013coronavirus and HCoV-NL63 use the same receptor but differ greatly in pathogenicity, and HCoV-NL63 infection in children seems to be such a frequent event, raise the concern that pathogenic variants could evolve and highlight the need for coronavirus vaccine development.",

These leukotrienes play a key role in the airway obstruction associated with asthma by mediating mucosal edema, mucus hyper-secretion, recruitment of eosinophils, and smooth muscle contraction. Bisgaard and colleagues [146] showed that a 4-week course of the cysteinyl leukotriene blocker montelukast in infants who had acute RSV bronchiolitis reduced daytime cough and increased the number of symptom-free days. Although this study population included children up to 36 months of age experiencing first-time wheezing, a detailed analysis of these data suggests that the effect was most pronounced in the younger subjects, an observation that correlates well with the evidence for higher levels of leukotriene levels in infants younger than 6 months [145], [146]. The study design focused on long-term rather than acute effects, and insufficient data support the use of montelukast for treating milder forms of the disease, or for relieving airways obstruction in the acute setting. As those authors and an accompanying editorial note, further investigation in an appropriate study population with documented RSV infection are needed to gauge the benefit of this therapy [147].",

In one study of hospitalized infants who had acute RSV bronchiolitis, the chest radiographs at discharge showed that recombinant human DNase treatment was associated with significant improvement [148]. However, therapy did not affect other clinical features, such as respiratory rate, wheezing, and retractions. A similar, smaller intervention study in more severely ill patients also showed this therapy to be effective in correcting massive atelectasis and avoiding the need for mechanical ventilation in patients who had impending respiratory failure [149].

In mice, surfactant deficiency confers an increased susceptibility to inflammation during RSV infection [151], [152]. If this increased susceptibility is also found in humans, identifying infants deficient in SP-A or -D who would be at risk for more severe RSV disease would be beneficial to target for prevention and therapy. Therefore, surfactant replacement is logical not only because of its effect on improving lung function but also because of the potential benefits of decreasing inflammation. In a small study of ventilated patients who had RSV bronchiolitis, the patients experiencing respiratory failure who were treated with two doses of bovine surfactant showed improved static compliance (indicative of decreased hyperinflation) and decreased airways resistance compared with the untreated patients [153]. No acute improvement in gas exchange occurred, but the group treated with surfactant showed improved oxygenation and ventilation indices over the first 60 hours of mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, surfactant currently must be delivered through endotracheal intubation, and therefore this therapy is reserved for children in respiratory failure. Larger studies are needed to assess the effects of surfactant on the duration of mechanical ventilation and on viral clearance [154].",

            "text": "Recently, Briese and colleagues [158] described the development of a MassTag PCR for differential diagnosis of respiratory disease. MassTag PCR is a multiplex assay in which the pathogen gene targets are coded by a library of 64 distinct mass tags. The microbial RNA or DNA is amplified by multiplex RT-PCR using up to 64 primers. Each primer is labeled with a different molecular weight tag, which is attached to the primer with a photo-cleavable link. After amplification, the mass tags are released from the amplified material with UV irradiation, and the identity of the tag is determined with mass spectrometry. The identity of the organism is determined from the presence of its two specific tags, one from each primer. The technology was successfully applied to respiratory disease in its first test case [158]. The multiplex primer sets were designed to identify up to 22 respiratory pathogens in a single MassTag PCR reaction, and the method was found to be highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing these viral and bacterial agents in clinical samples. The tests were performed using blinded analysis of previously diagnosed clinical specimens (banked sputum, nasal swabs, and lung washes), and the MassTag PCR was highly effective at identifying all pathogens, including RSV; HPIV-1, -2, and -3; HMPV; influenza; and coronavirus-SARS (HCoV-NL63 was not included in the study). This technology probably will be used most immediately in the public health setting for identifying outbreaks and global surveillance. As the technology becomes streamlined and mass spectrometry becomes more easily accessible, this method has great potential for individual patient management.",
