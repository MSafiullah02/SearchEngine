The development presented here as a sequence of the life cycle stages, including requirements analysis, design, implementation and testing. Specifics of the implementation for each targeted operating system are given.",

To this aim, researchers have proposed hardware-based tools as well as model-based [13] and software-based [14] techniques to approximate the actual energy profile of applications. However, all these solutions present their own advantages and disadvantages. Hardware-based tools are highly precise, but at the same time their use is bound to the acquisition of costly hardware components. Model-based tools require the calibration of parameters needed to correctly create a model on a specific hardware device. Software-based approaches are cheaper and easier to use than hardware-based tools, but they are believed to be less precise. We present the collectors (Windows, MacOs), a software-based approach whose duty is to gather all valuable data about active and passively running applications together with energy based metrics. This data when collected can later be processed on the server and result in precise trends and predictions which could enormously benefit software development teams. Making it Open Source exhibits several advantages, as evidenced in several scientific venues [7, 9, 15, 21] .",
