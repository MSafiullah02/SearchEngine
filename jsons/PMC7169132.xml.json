Fig. 2A shows the similar trend for respiratory symptoms scores and viral shedding over time with nearly 1 day delay for respiratory symptoms measured, indicating that as the viral shedding increased, an increase in respiratory symptoms scores was observed. Our result shows that the optimized Hill\u2010based regression equation y = 1/(1 + (b/x)c) best describes the dose\u2010response relationship between symptoms scores and viral load with fitted parameter values of b = 0.73 logTCID50 mL\u22121 and c = 1.45 (r\n2= 0.86, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). Similar to Fig. 2A, we then integrated the decrease in% PEF and viral shedding over time in experimental human influenza infection to explore the relationship between them (Fig. 3A). The reconstructed decrease in% PEF and viral load profile reveals that the Hill function with a 10,000 MC simulation provided an adequate fit for the data (r\n2= 0.90, p < 0.001) with fitted parameter values of b = 6.75 logTCID50 mL\u22121 and c = 0.77 (Fig. 3B).",

This study implicates that influenza viral infection is a major risk factor for exacerbations of chronic occupational asthma. Our results show that viral infection was a highly significant risk factor for adults with chronic occupational asthma (exacerbations risk = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.45\u20130.61 corresponding to exceedence risk = 0.5) compared with asymptomatic controls (exacerbations risk = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.08\u20130.13).

The convex pattern of FEV1 values had been evidenced in association of ages.(\n\n40\n, \n41\n\n) We considered that the PEF empirical equation for men (loge PEF (L min\u22121) = 0.544 loge age \u2212 0.0151 age \u2212 74.7/height (cm) + 5.48) was proper for our study (Table II). On the other hand, the major PEF data adopted from Malo et al.\n(\n\n37\n\n) in our selected three scenarios did not describe the information of age for participant subjects. However, we found that the mean duration of exposure for participant subjects was 9.4 years. Moreover, Leroyer et al.\n(\n\n42\n\n) also reported that the averaged age and duration of exposure were 40.4 and 12.8 years, respectively. Hence, we reasonably assumed that the average participant age and body height was 40 years and 170 cm, respectively. Thus the predicted PEF was estimated to be 628.5 L min\u22121, resulting in the PEF (% predicted) values in Table II of 80.6%, 67.1%, and 56.9%, respectively. Although Miller(\n\n43\n\n) proposed the recalculated regression (loge PEF (L min\u22121) = 0.755 loge age \u2212 0.021 age \u2212 104.1/height (cm) + 5.16) of PEF values for men, the proposed relative standard deviation (46 L min\u22121) was higher than the difference of two predicted PEF values (660.3 L min\u22121 by using recalculated regression, difference = 31.8 L min\u22121). Thus, results showed that the two PEF values were not significantly different. Moreover, if the recalculated PEF values replaced the used one, it did not affect the outcomes in this study.",

Using a coupled detrended fluctuation analysis\u2010experimental human influenza approach, we estimated the conditional probability of moderate or severe lung airway obstruction and hence the influenza\u2010associated occupational asthma exacerbations risk in individuals. Here we provided a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying influenza\u2010associated exacerbations risk for occupational asthmatics, based on a combination of published distributions of viral shedding and symptoms scores and lung respiratory system properties. We used a pharmacokinetic\u2010based Hill equation to construct the relationship among respiratory symptoms scores, lung function, and viral dynamic because it is a dose\u2010dependent biological response model. It also allows us to compare the cooperatively among different dose\u2010response profiles that can explicitly show the responses are depending on the maximum respiratory symptoms scores/peak expiratory flow and viral titer.(\n\n44\n\n) We showed that the conditional probability functions of P(respiratory symptoms scores|PEF) and P(exacerbations risk|\u03b1) are robust indicators of the probability that severe asthma episodes will occur for influenza\u2010associated occupational asthmatics. Based on the calculated correlation exponent \u03b1, this study found that limiting wheeze scores to 0.56 yields a 75% probability of exacerbations risk of influenza\u2010associated asthma and a limit of 0.34 yields a 50% probability that may give a representative estimate of the distribution of chronic respiratory system properties.",

Therefore, we adopted Grazzini et al.\n(\n\n45\n\n) to support the definitions of a 5\u2010score system for wheeze symptoms in our study. Grazzini et al.\n(\n\n45\n\n) used the score from 0 to 4 to present none, 1\u20132 per year, monthly, weekly, and daily, respectively. In our study, we treated the wheeze symptom scores as normalized values from 0 to 1 for simplified and consistent reasons. Hence, the normalized wheeze values of 0.11, 0.34, and 0.50 could be considered as mild (none to yearly), moderate (yearly to monthly), and severe (monthly to weekly) conditions, respectively. The normalized value greater than 0.75 could be considered as a very severe condition (means episode with daily). Yet Mitra et al.\n(\n\n46\n\n) proposed a 4\u2010score system (from 0 to 3) for describing the wheeze symptom. However, if future study used the normalized values that we estimated by the 4\u2010score system of wheeze symptom, the severe conditions of patients should be redefined. That is to say, different score systems for wheeze symptoms decided the clinical cut\u2010points (such as yearly, monthly, weekly, or daily).",

The published data that we used might not all be dependent and not equally likely, and might not be formally combined. They are used here to represent the applicable published observational data whose implications for exacerbations risk prediction of influenza\u2010associated asthma have not been analyzed before. On the other hand, determining probabilistic exacerbations risk for future occupational asthma episodes caused by influenza virus infection is challenging, as it requires a synthesis of uncertainties along the cause\u2010effect chain from viral infection to lung function variations. For example, uncertainties may exist in the PEF measurements, viral shedding and symptoms scores, and asthmatic responses. Uncertainties in future exacerbation predictions of influenza\u2010associated asthma can be quantified by constraining the present risk\u2010based predictive model parameters to reproduce temporal history of lung function fluctuations, asthma severity and stability, and fluctuating environmental stimuli (e.g., allergens, infections, and pollutants).(\n\n30\n\n) Future studies can use DFA to quantify the time\u2010series environmental stimuli data and to correlate the relationships with lung function fluctuations.",

To improve risk assessment of asthma severity, the fluctuation analysis approach can be applied to analyze the correlation properties based on observation of the long\u2010term temporal fluctuations of clinical and physiological markers. From the perspective point of view toward health surveillance of occupational asthma, we hoped that the proposed DFA\u2010based PEF scheme would (i) enable the early identification of adverse health effects in individuals, (ii) complement environmental monitoring in assessing control, and (iii) contribute to the process of hazard and risk assessment.",

For our illustrative distribution of PEF fluctuations and influenza\u2010induced asthma exacerbations risk relations, we found that the probability of exacerbations risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping correlation exponent (\u03b1) to below 0.53. If the acceptable exceedence probability were 50%, this would limit a wheeze score of 0.34 or lower. Further theoretical and experimental analyses are required to achieve a better understanding of influenza\u2010induced asthma exacerbations risk. However, we think there is room for further improvement, especially in better understanding the experimental human influenza infection of respiratory symptoms, the effect of influenza virus infection on PEF/FEV1 in asthmatics, and dynamic disease of respiratory system\u2010based fluctuation analysis.",
