            "text": "In general, viral diagnostic tests can be divided into two groups; they are either developed to detect the virus directly or indirectly; by determining the host response in particular virus-specific antibodies that are induced upon infection. While the indirect approach is probably the most common in current diagnostics, it cannot be used for hemodialysed and immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, the time lag between virus infection and the ability to detect specific antibodies varies from patient to patient and from virus to virus. For certain viruses, seroconversion occurs only months after infection, leading to false-negative results that can have dramatic consequences for blood donation or screening of populations at risk. In other cases, virus-specific antibodies are circulating in the blood long after the clearance of the virus infection, resulting in false-positive tests. These limitations can be avoided by direct detection of the virus (i.e., virus cultivation, antigen detection and nucleic acid-based detection) (Table 1\n).",

In addition to the ability to quantify the number of viruses using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), isolation of nucleic acids also allows additional analyses, such as sequencing, to gather information on sensitivity to anti-viral treatment and on the origin of the virus, which is important for outbreak management. Quantification of pathogens, in particular of viruses, is often used to stage disease activity, prognosticate disease progression, monitor efficacy of therapy and prevent transmission. For example, in the case of HIV, the risk of progression to AIDS is directly related to the magnitude of the viral load in plasma. In addition, the number of viruses of an HIV-infected mother is the strongest risk factor for transmission to the child during delivery. Another important example is reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after transplantation, which negatively impacts the transplantation outcomes leading to graft versus host disease. In these two examples, quantitative PCR methods are frequently used to monitor viral load. Although the PCR is relatively fast, generally 2\u20134 h, it is commonly performed in batch in a centralized laboratory and cannot be done near the patient that leads to increased turn-around time. The clinical relevance of qPCR sensitivity for viral detection is questionable, because typical viral infections result in large numbers of viral particles. The quest therefore continues for the ideal diagnostic method that is affordable, fast, accurate and easy to use outside of centralized laboratories.",

A recent example is the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa; accurate diagnosis in this context is especially important since early symptoms of Ebola virus disease mimic those of many other diseases commonly seen in this region, including symptoms associated with malaria, typhoid fever, and Lassa fever [13]. A multiplex capacity is, for example, required in the context of respiratory infections that can commonly be caused by a broad range of different viruses. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, the viral load is strongly related to disease and clinical outcome, thus quantification is important to monitor treatment effectiveness.",

Furthermore, it is important that the assay is compatible with a large variety of sample matrices, such as for human diagnostics, nasopharyngeal wash, oropharyngeal swabs, cerebrospinal fluid, stool, urine, and blood. The design of a POCT starts with the selection of the target. To select the most suitable viral target, it is vital to understand the anatomy and the replication cycle of the virus. The virus anatomy can be divided in three parts:(1)the genetic material, either RNA or DNA, inside the virus;(2)a coat consisting of proteins on which surface epitopes essential for attachment and infection are localized; and, for some viruses,(3)a lipid bilayer or envelope to protect the protein coat.\n",

Virus-particle quantification is difficult, due to the lack of proper standards; this problem was recently alleviated by emerging particle-characterization methods that can provide virion concentrations in a calibration-free manner by using the resistive pulse technique [14], [15] or optical methods [16]. These methods have been used to quantify poliovirus, which is one of the smallest viruses (~26 nm diameter).",

The conformation of aptamers relies on base-pair stacking and contains hairpins, bulges, interior and multi-branch loops, but can also form complex 3D structures (e.g., the G-quadruplex conformation) [17]. The binding affinity and specificity of aptamers is similar and, in many cases, superior to monoclonal antibodies, but aptamers can be more rapidly, reproducibly and cost-effectively generated by a fully in vitro selection procedure [i.e., Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX)] [18]. Since the SELEX method does not depend on living organisms, aptamers can be selected against non-immunogenic and toxic agents, and they can detect their targets even in non-physiological conditions [19]. Their fast generation is particularly attractive to anticipate continuously evolving virus strains. Moreover, by using counter-selection steps during SELEX, cross-reacting aptamers can be eliminated so as to result in aptamers with high discriminating capacity between different virus genotypes. Other advantages of aptamers can be attributed to their physical-chemical properties (i.e., they are chemically stable over a wide range of pH, storage conditions and temperature, and are not as sensitive to organic solvents as antibodies) [20]. Aptamers can be directionally, most often terminally, labeled with functional [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] or analytical [26], [27] probes without loss of function, while oriented labeling options for antibodies are limited and can lead to decreased affinity [19]. Further chemical modifications were reported to generate aptamer probes for diagnostic purposes that are fully resistant to nuclease enzymes [28]. All these are important steps towards the development of a new generation of viral diagnostic POCTs.",

Suggested improvements or alterations include increased variability of targets, target-binding conditions, different amplification methods or better partitioning of the non-binders. The success of the aptamer-generation procedure is primarily determined by the applied selection conditions and the target molecules chosen for selection. The first criterion must be met because, though aptamers can recognize their targets even under non-physiological conditions, ligand-aptamer interactions are very sensitive to the prevailing conditions. To evade this pitfall, the composition of selection buffer should be as close as possible to the matrix of real life samples in which the diagnostic exploitation of the aptamer is intended. Overlooking this condition could lead to a meaningless selection procedure (i.e., the isolated aptamer works ideally under optimal, laboratory conditions but is inadequate for practical application). Seemingly, this factor was ignored during the selection of many published aptamers, which could limit their diagnostic potential.",

            "text": "To raise virus-specific aptamers, the target of selection can be either a virus-derived protein or the inactivated virus particle. Traditionally, SELEX uses purified single proteins as ligand for selection and application of this approach resulted in several virus-selective aptamers. The protein-ligand-based SELEX methods were extensively discussed in recent reviews [29], [30]. When using inactivated virus particles as the target, isolation (purification) and inactivation of viruses are generally more challenging than production of pure proteins and require dedicated laboratories with strict safety control. These hurdles might explain why only a handful of whole virus-selected aptamers has been published so far. Nevertheless, one of the earliest studies demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, i.e., the virus-specific aptamer selection resulted in RNA oligonucleotides having the capacity to discriminate between closely-related human-influenza viruses [31]. The authors incubated the RNA pool with an A/Panama strain and separated the virus-selective oligonucleotides by filtration through a protein-binding nitrocellulose-acetate membrane. To increase the specificity of the isolated oligonucleotides, counter selection steps were also introduced using A/Aichi virus preparation. The aptamer obtained displayed over 15-fold-higher affinity to hemagglutinin compared with the monoclonal antibody and distinguished the various influenza viruses. The same procedure (i.e., isolation of aptamer candidates by passing the virus-oligonucleotide mixture through nitrocellulose membrane and removing the non\u2013specific binders by counter selection with related virus) was effectively applied to raising DNA and RNA aptamers against murine norovirus and human influenza viruses, respectively [32], [33].",

Both groups applied viruses captured by monoclonal antibody cross-linked paramagnetic beads as targets of SELEX and increased the selection pressure by introducing counter-selection steps with human-stool suspension and close relatives of the target virus, respectively. The performed enzyme-linked aptamer sorbent assay (ELASA) demonstrated that the norovirus-specific aptamers are selective for various strains of this virus. Importantly, the isolated aptamers could detect their target virus even in the clinical matrix feces [34]. Using this state-of-the-art procedure, influenza-virus aptamer selection was fully implemented in an integrated microfluidic chip [35].",

Leveraging this phenomenon, so-called GO-SELEX was invented and applied successfully for generation of highly-selective BVDV-specific aptamers (Fig. 3\n) [39]. In the first step of the selection, the incubation of oligonucleotide library with the classical swine-fever virus was followed by addition of GO. The oligonucleotides that did not bind to the counter targets were adsorbed to the surface of GO and separated by centrifugation, while oligonucleotides that bound to the counter target were suspended in the binding buffer. Then, the ssDNA was recovered from the GO with the addition of the target BVDV and amplified by PCR. Following five rounds of this very stringent selection, highly-selective aptamers were obtained and used in a surface-plasmon resonance (SPR)-based sandwich-type assay.",

The nucleic-acid aptamers offer inherent fluorescent transduction mechanisms that are hardly possible with antibody-based recognition, such as the use of molecular beacon aptamers [83]. It was shown that RNA-aptamer beacons can be made specific to detect the presence of HIV-1 Tat proteins or its peptides (i.e., enabling them to discriminate RNA-binding proteins) by using split oligomers derived from RNA Tat aptamer. In the presence of the target, the two oligomers form a duplex that leads to the removal of the fluorophore from the vicinity of the quencher, and consequently to an increase in the fluorescence signal [83].",

A relevant example for such a system was based on the use of thiazole orange (TO) that fluoresces upon binding to the G-quadruplexes stabilized by target-aptamer interactions. This enabled the fluorescence detection of H5N1 influenza virus in human serum by using a guanine-rich aptamer for the recombinant hemagglutinin protein of the virus. An additional sensitivity enhancement was obtained by immobilizing the aptamers on Ag@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles, which acted as a metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF)-sensing platform. Thus, a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.5 ng/mL of the protein target could be realized with an assay time ~30 min in human serum [67]. A dramatically lower LOD was reported by Ahn et al. by microarray-based fluorescent detection, though tested in a less demanding matrix [45]. They developed an RNA aptamer against the C-terminal region of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein (with a KD of 1.65 nM) and implemented it in aptamer\u2013antibody hybrid immunoassays [i.e., chemiluminescence immunosorbent assay (CLISA) and a nanoarray aptamer chip]. CLISA had an LOD of 20 pg/mL purified nucleocapsid protein, which was similar to ELISA [84], while the nanoarray aptamer chip had an even lower LOD of 2 pg/mL. However, the detection of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid was still antibody mediated, and, similar to other immunosorbent assays published [47], [51], a relatively long assay time due to the required labeling made these assays less suitable for POCT.",

They used hemagglutinin as the target to select a DNA aptamer and subsequently used whole AIV H5N1 particles as a target to increase the specificity. The DNA aptamer with the lowest Kd (4.65 nM) was selected and subsequently immobilized on the gold surface of the sensor. The detection range for poultry-swab samples containing the virus was 1.28\u201312.8 hemagglutination units (HAU). The SPR biosensor was very specific for AIV H5N2 and displayed only very low signals (<4%) when exposed to six other non-targeted AIVs. A great advantage of this portable aptasensor, when compared to more conventional methods, is the relatively short detection time of 1.5 h. At the same time, the system is label-free, lacks the use of antibodies and can be reused 5\u20137 times.",

By contrast, colorimetric aptasensors or lateral-flow assays that would be more suitable for POCT can be evaluated even with the naked eye. Apparently, this aspect has so far received less attention in terms of using aptamers as selective recognition reagents. Colorimetric detection based on aggregation of aptamer-modified AuNPs by virions was explored for influenza virus. The aggregation was combined with a simple centrifugation step to enhance visual perception by precipitation of the aggregates. However, the LOD obtained (108 VP/mL) is at the upper end of the relevant virus load [69].",

            "text": "Since the discovery of aptamers, expectations for clinical application, in particular, for diagnostic aptasensor development, were high. However, the use of aptamers in practice is still rare. Probably the most important scientific reason relates to difficulties in the selection of highly-selective aptamers for widely different targets and measurement conditions. Recently, the first promising aptasensors made their debut in viral diagnostics, which will hopefully increase interest in diagnostic aptasensors in the near future.",

There is a strong demand for multiplexed diagnostic measurement of pathogens, as disease is often caused by co-infections.",

So far, only a few aptamer-based applications have shown potential for multiplex measurement of mixtures of bacteria [93], [94]. However, no aptamer-based detection method has been developed to measure multiple viruses. Therefore, it is important to define clearly these aspects per case and to follow an iterative approach to continue redefining assay requirements and selecting the most appropriate targets, aptamers and aptasensors, all affecting the development of the POCT (Fig. 4\n).",
