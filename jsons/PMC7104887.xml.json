Applied to large biological supramolecular complexes, such as viruses, microtubules, micro- and nanocompartments, and small cellular organelles [4\u20137], dynamic force spectroscopy has enabled researchers to interrogate these large-size biological protein assemblies mechanically, to probe the limits of their mechanical strength, and to gather valuable information about their nanomechanical characteristics, including the critical deformation, Youngs modulus, shear modulus, flexural rigidity, etc [6, 8\u201317]. Although a considerable amount of experimental effort has been expended to understand how the mechanical response of biological particles depends on their compressive-force induced deformation, many difficulties remain, e.g. regarding the interpretation of force-deformation spectra [18]. Experimental resolution in the state-of-the-art single-molecule forced-deformation assays do not allow researchers to extract the molecular level structural details underlying dynamic transitions in biological particles, such as buckling and structural collapse.",

Among these are: finite element analysis (FEA) [14, 19\u201321], explicit and implicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [22\u201324], elastic network modeling (ENM) [25\u201327], and various coarse-graining (CG) techniques [28\u201333]. However, these approaches have exhibited a number of drawbacks. For example, FEA and ENM approaches do not take into account the discrete nature of biological particles\u2019 structures, such as a virion (formed by self-assembly of capsid proteins) or a microtubule (built by laterally and longitudinally assembled head-to-tail linked \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers). Because these approaches do not have a thermostat, they cannot capture the stochastic nature of biological particles\u2019 mechanical deformation and collapse. The all-atom MD simulations account for the discreteness and stochastic variation of the particles\u2019 structures, but owing to their immense system size the all-atom MD schemes do not allow researchers to follow the dynamics of particles in the biologically relevant timescale. Langevin simulations of particles\u2019 nanoindentation, in conjunction with some of the coarse-grained models, employ force-loading rates three orders of magnitude faster than their experimental counterparts [28, 31], and so the results of experiments in vitro and in silico cannot be compared.",

The  \u223c10\u2013100 fold computational acceleration attainable on graphics processing units (GPUs) with SOP-GPU software allows for using the experimental force protocol and reaching biologically relevant timescales up to hundreds of milliseconds [34, 40, 41], which makes the results comparable with the experimental data.

This software enables researchers to compute the stress distribution in biological matter using the results of MD simulations. The approach utilizes an idea of \u2018local atomic stress\u2019, i.e. when the stress is represented by the derivative of the total atomic forces acting on a particular atom along different directions. Taking the average over all the interactions involving this atom mimics the integration over all the forces acting on an arbitrary volume element [42]. This approach was first introduced by Basinski [43] for the calculation of shear stress in a simple body-centered cubic lattice. Shortly thereafter, Hardy derived this stress measure in a more general form [44], which later was adapted by researches in their studies of material properties of crystalline substances [45\u201347] and amorphous structures [48]. Ishikura et al used this concept in conjunction with the MD simulations and all-atom force field to calculate the atomic forces and local atomic stresses in short polypeptide chains [49]. To our knowledge, there has been only a single study [50], in which this approach was used to compute the stress distribution in viral shells.",

            "text": "The dynamics of biological particles evolve on multidimensional energy landscapes. In AFM-based single-particle compressive-force experiments, the particle\u2019s dynamics is projected along the direction of particle deformation (\u2018reaction coordinate\u2019), which limits the information obtainable. The force-deformation spectra reveal the critical forces and critical deformations for the collapse transition, but offer little insight as to what caused the transition and do not provide structural details. Here, we show that dynamic evolution of biological particles can be illuminated by considering the propagation and distribution of mechanical stress in the particle\u2019s structure. We use cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) as a suitable model system since it was extensively studied previously by us [36, 51] and other research groups [20, 27, 31, 52]. We explore the rich dynamics of stress distribution in the CCMV shell tested mechanically by considering the most common stress measures used to describe properties of materials, including the first principal stress, von Mises shear stress, and Tresca shear stress [53, 54]. Our results raise questions regarding some of the theoretical approaches used to model the dynamics of biological particles, including finite element analysis and elastic network models, in which stochastic fluctuations and entropic effects are ignored. We also formulate for soft biological particles like CCMV the yield condition in terms of the first principal stress components, and the failure criterion in terms of von Mises stress or Tresca stress.",

In the first mode, it computes the atomic stress tensors for an existing simulation input (LD run). In this mode, TensorCalculator produces the TNSR output file. The TNSR file is a text file with the strings format similar to that used in PDB; however, instead of coordinate values for each particle it contains stress tensor components per particle for each trajectory frame (moment of time). This is the most time consuming part of the program, and it needs to be done only once. In the second mode, TensorCalculator produces different outputs with the stress tensor components reported as scalar quantities.

Clearly then, biological particles are discrete structures and there is a more philosophical question to consider: how large can a particle be so that the concepts of continuum mechanics can be applied to describe their physical and materials properties? For example, Cauchy stress is widely used in materials science to study the physical properties of materials undergoing small deformations. On the other hand, we have demonstrated in our previous studies of the CCMV capsid [36] and microtubule polymer fragments [24] that the long-wavelength global modes, which control the displacements of entire structural subunits (i.e. hexon and penton capsomers in the CCMV shell or microtubule protofilaments in microtubules), and the symmetry of their arrangement, rather than atomic level details, determine the mechanical properties of biological particles and their response to external physical inputs. Hence, large-size biological particles do permit a continuum representation, which allows use of the apparatus of continuum mechanics to describe their properties. Yet, computational molecular modeling of biological particles requires having a discrete representation of the polypeptide chains, either atomic or simplified (coarse-grained) bead-per-residue, and so there is an issue of how continuum measures can be calculated for the discrete structures.",

These are important stress measures widely used in materials science and mechanical engineering. The stress invariants are characteristics of the tensors which, unlike the tensors components, do not change upon the transformation of coordinates. The principal values characterize stress components in the direction of maximum tension or compression, and they are often used by engineers to formulate the yield and failure criteria of materials. The von Mises stress and Tresca stress are derivative quantities from the stress invariants and principal stress components. These measures are widely used in mechanical engineering to define the yield and failure criteria for brittle versus ductile materials [53, 54].",

Hence, it should be expected that thermal effects play an important role in the capsid\u2019s evolution, and in defining the dynamics and setting the energy scale for global transitions in a virus capsid, such as buckling and structural collapse. We analyzed the effect of thermal fluctuations on the stress evolution in the CCMV capsid structure by carrying out nanoindentation measurements at zero temperature (T  =  0 K) and finite temperature (T  =  300 K). Quite surprisingly, we found that the mechanical response (as reflected by the FX-curves), the stress magnitude and the pattern of stress propagation and distribution in the virus capsid, all change with temperature (see figure 3).

For example, the finite elements analysis [20] and variances of elastic network modeling [25] analyze the potential energy changes, while the entropy changes are ignored. In a sense, this is similar to setting T  =  0 K in our nanoindentation experiments in silico. However, our results clearly demonstrate large differences in the FX-spectra collected at zero and finite temperature, as well as in the amplitude and pattern of stress evolution in the CCMV shell. For example, at T  =  0 K the mechanical stress in the top and side portions of the CCMV structure both increase, whereas at T  =  300 K the stress in the top decreases and the stress in the sides increases (figure 3). Hence, thermal fluctuations modulate the mechanical and materials properties of virus capsids, and the entropic effects are significant and not to be ignored. The importance of the entropic effects, clearly expressed in the quite different stress distributions presented for the T  =  0 K and T  =  300 K (see figure 3), suggest that investigators should be cautious in their application of continuum mechanics models, such as finite element analysis and elastic network modeling, to structural models of biological particles.",

Numerical subroutines have been organized into a lab-written software package called TensorCalculator, which can now be used to study the stress evolution and dynamics of defects in viral capsids and other protein assemblies tested mechanically. The TensorCalculator code is open source code and it is fully available for downloading at https://github.com/BarsegovGroup/TensorCalculator.git.",
