There are three non-falciparum plasmodia to consider. P. malariae can cause minimally symptomatic chronic malaria but is not common. In P. malariae infection, the parasitemia is very low, infected RBCs are of normal size, and typical trophozoites called band forms are recognized. P. vivax and P. ovale are quite similar on blood smears. In both of these, infected RBCs are enlarged, with the presence of intracytoplasmic Sch\u00fcffner's dots; young ring forms are large, about one third of the diameter of an RBC; and ameboid trophozoites are recognized. It is difficult to differentiate between the two species, but P. ovale tends to cause infected, enlarged RBCs to have an oval shape (see Table 46 .2) [1] [2] [3] [4] .",

Our patient had therefore acquired P. ovale malaria in West Africa despite being on malaria prophylaxis there. She remained asymptomatic for more than a year when a hypnozoite activated and caused a relapse of malaria. The patient was treated for P. vivax malaria with chloroquine phosphate 1000 mg once, followed by 500 mg 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h later. Her glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) level was normal, allowing her physicians to prescribe safely primaquine 30 mg a day for 14 days to eradicate hypnozoites and to prevent further relapses of malaria [5] .",

            "text": "Female Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria at night, injecting sporozoa when they take a blood meal. Plasmodia are Apicomplexa, protozoa that use an apical complex of organelles and microtubules to penetrate into cells. Plasmodia infect hepatocytes (exoerythrocytic schizogony) first, then reach the blood, and infect RBCs (erythrocytic schizogony). There are four species of human plasmodia. P. falciparum is highly lethal, causing about 95% of malaria-related mortality. Because the parasite infects all RBCs regardless of their age, it can cause very high parasitemia. Because it induces RBCs to grow PfEMP-1 knobs on their surface with resulting entrapment of the mature protozoa in the microcirculation, tissue injury is much more severe in falciparum malaria, with manifestations including cerebral malaria, placenta infection with adverse effects on pregnancy, and pulmonary edema or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2] [3] [4] . Uncomplicated RBC red blood cell falciparum malaria manifestations include fever (every day initially, especially in travelers without prior semi-immunity; with prior semiimmunity, a fever every other day is often seen) and many associated symptoms (e.g., headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and profuse sweats). The complete blood count usually shows anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a normal white blood cell count. Even uncomplicated falciparum malaria can progress rapidly to severe illness. P. falciparum can result in a large number of complications (see Table 46 .3), and treatment is considered an emergency. Because P. falciparum has acquired drug resistance to multiple antimalarial agents, including chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, mefloquine, quinine, and recently artemisinin derivatives, treatment always includes two different agents, and choice of therapy depends on the severity of illness. Acutely ill patients are best treated in the intensive care unit with rapidly acting intravenous agents, such as quinidine, quinine, or artesunate, plus a second active drug (doxycycline or clindamycin). Patients who are stable and can take oral therapy usually receive one of three combinations: atovaquone/proguanil, artemether/lumefantrine, or a combination of quinine plus either doxycycline or clindamycin [2] [3] [4] [5] . P. vivax is highly prevalent, including previously in North America and Europe. It only infects young RBCs, resulting in lower parasitemia (1-2%). It requires the Duffy receptor on the surface of RBCs and therefore is rare in most of sub-Saharan Africa, although common in the horn of Africa and in Madagascar. Liver hypnozoites allow the parasite to survive cold winters. Chloroquine resistance has been described in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Patients present initially with daily fever and then get febrile paroxysms every 48 h (benign tertian fever). Splenic rupture is a rare complication.",
