These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9\u00b78-44\u00b77% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8\u00b73-38\u00b76% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18-23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths.",

An analysis of the 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus in west Africa showed that the indirect effects of the outbreak were more severe than the outbreak itself. 4 Although mortality rates for COVID-19 appear to be low in children and in women of reproductive age, 5 these groups might be disproportionately affected by the disruption of routine health services, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). With this in mind, we sought to quantify the potential indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality.",

During the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a 23\u00b79% reduction in ambulatory care and a 35\u00b72% reduction in inpatient care was observed in Taiwan. Similar indirect effects are plausible as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and control efforts.",

The World Food Programme has warned that the number of people facing food crises could double because of the pandemic, so our upper assumption of a 50% relative increase seems within reason. 21 For scenario 1 (table 1) , we assume small reductions in the availability of health workers and supplies due to the reallocation of resources to the pandemic response. We also assume small reductions in the demand for and access to routine health services, due to movement restrictions, fear of infection, and economic pressure. People become disinclined to seek care for interventions deemed more acceptable to delay or forego, such as antenatal, postnatal, and preventive interventions.

We applied two assumptions in estimating the herd effect of these vaccines.

Second, in countries with higher vaccination coverage, 80% of the unvaccinated cohort would remain protected by the herd effect. 28 Because of the scarcity of evidence on the herd protection offered by meningococcal A vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, and the high coverage threshold for herd protection for measles vaccine, we did not attenuate the effects of these vaccines; rather, we assumed the full effect of the coverage reduction on mortality.",

All authors had access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Table 2 shows the estimated additional maternal and child deaths for each scenario among all 118 countries. These numbers represent the deaths due specifically to the reductions in coverage and increase in wasting-ie, deaths that would not occur if coverage and wasting instead stayed constant. We report child deaths excluding and including the effects of increased wasting. The estimates are reported for a 1-month period (per month) and extrapolated for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month periods. The estimates do not reflect deaths during transition periods in which coverage is decreasing or returning to baseline. The number of additional deaths increases with the severity of the coverage reductions and wasting increases, with scenario 1 (smallest reductions) resulting in an additional 2030 maternal deaths and 42 240 child deaths per month, and scenario 3 (greatest reductions) resulting in an additional 9450 maternal deaths and 192 830 child deaths per month. Country-specific numbers are provided in the appendix (p 443). Table 2 and figure 2 show additional deaths compared with baseline deaths in a no-change scenario. Currently, there are approximately 24 500 maternal deaths and 431 690 child deaths per month in the 118 countries. 25, 26 The additional maternal deaths would represent relative increases of 8\u00b73% (scenario 1), 14\u00b77% (scenario 2), and 38\u00b76% (scenario 3) in maternal deaths per month. The additional child deaths would represent relative increases of 9\u00b78% (scenario 1), 17\u00b73% (scenario 2), and 44\u00b77% (scenario 3) in child deaths per month. Tables 3 and 4 show the contributions of individual interventions to total additional maternal and child deaths. This ranking is driven by the country-specific baseline coverage of each intervention, by the assumed coverage reductions for each intervention in our scenarios, and by the strength of each intervention on averting mortality (based on intervention efficacy and underlying countryspecific causes of mortality). The reduced coverage of four child birth interventions (namely, parenteral administration of utero tonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments, which reduce mortality due to postpartum haemorrhage, maternal sepsis, and eclampsia) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths (table 3) . In children, an increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18-23% of additional deaths, depending on the scenario, while reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths (table 4 ).",

Although this might seem obvious, we see three important messages that come from this exercise.",

There has been debate around the trade-off between establishing movement restrictions and minimising disruptions to business and economies. Our results show that the indirect effects of the pandemic are not merely economic. If the delivery of health care is disrupted, many women and children will die. Thus, while public health experts are advocating for social distancing, there is also a public health case for ensuring access to routine care. Our estimates quantify the potential effect on RMNCH and provide a reference point for policy makers.",

As policy makers consider plans to reallocate staff and resources, they might need to prioritise interventions. In our scenarios, maintaining coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would save 60% of additional maternal deaths. Maintaining coverage of antibiotics for neonatal sepsis and pneumonia and oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would save 41% of additional child deaths. Disruption of these interventions-childbirth and child curative services-cannot be mitigated through postoutbreak activities or easily averted through vertical health programmes outside of the public health system. The vulnerability of these interventions to disruption, and their substantial consequences for mortality, highlight the need to ensure provision of these services throughout the pandemic and support citizens in using these services as safely as possible.",

Although our assumptions for this were speculative, we are confident that, if wasting does increase, it will contribute greatly to child mortality. The drivers of wasting might lie outside of the health system, but there are interventions that health policy makers could consider (eg, ready-to-use therapeutic foods). More importantly, multisectoral action should be taken to mitigate increases in wasting by strengthening and expanding social safety nets and by supporting local food and agricultural systems.",

This high coverage grants herd protection for some vaccine-preventable diseases, attenuating the immediate effects of coverage declines on mortality. However, even short gaps in vaccination coverage can result in overall declines in population coverage, and catch-up campaigns should be prioritised in the aftermath of the pandemic. 15 Third, once the pandemic is over, health systems must recover quickly. As life returns to normal, countries should advance resilient health systems and reinvigorate demand for routine care. The longer that coverage reductions continue, the more lives will be lost. Once care-seeking patterns are broken, they might be hard to reinstate. We should not delay in restoring health services as soon as possible if we are to minimise the lasting impact of otherwise temporary disruptions.",

Moreover, our understanding of what might be possible is based largely on experiences in high-income countries; the effects of the pandemic in LMICs, and the response to it, will probably be different. 29 For all these reasons, our results are intended to help understand the potential magnitude of the effect, not to offer exact or even approximate numbers.",

Similarly, a comprehensive analysis would consider in more detail the long-term effect of temporary reductions in vaccine coverage (assuming no catch-up campaigns), the longterm effect of fertility increases due to temporary reductions in contraceptive prevalence, and the additional deaths during a post-pandemic period in which coverage is returning to baseline. LiST does not capture individual infectious disease dynamics and therefore does not reflect the potential effects of secondary outbreaks in the absence of preventive interventions (eg, localised measles outbreaks due to a gap in measles vaccination), as modelled in other analyses. 30 In general, we expect the pandemic to affect the health of women and children in more ways than we have captured, not fewer, including through causal pathways unknown to us now.
