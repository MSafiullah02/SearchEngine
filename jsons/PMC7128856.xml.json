Transmission is thought to be due to close physical contact or due to consumption of camel products.3.The epidemiology since the virus was first found in 2012 is compatible with multiple introductions into humans from the animal reservoir, with no long-term sustained human-to-human transmission.4.There is no human reservoir of cases with few or no symptoms.5.The basic reproductive rate has been estimated to range below 1. Preliminary data from contact studies suggest a considerably lower rate below 0.5, suggesting that the virus has no pandemic potential. Special situations such as hospitalization with breaches in infection control practice can however cause local outbreaks with short transmission chains.6.Nosocomial infection is an important risk factor for human to human transmission. Thus infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV within health care facilities. Hospital infection control procedures needs to be emphazised and enforced. The Jeddah outbreak showed that it is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. It is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients irrespective of the diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be undertaken when providing care to patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Contact precautions including eye protection should be added when caring for suspected or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be taken when performing aerosol generating procedures7.In asymptomatic cases RT-PCR testing is not recommended. Asymptomatic cases should be recorded and tested by serology after 3 weeks from exposure, unless symptoms develop.8.Awareness of MERS-CoV is important in countries where camels and dromedars are a common livestock.9.The importance of educational campaigns for educating health care workers, the general public, family contacts and travelers to the Middle East was emphasized. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing, antiseptic before and after handling animals Owners of camels and dromedars should use gloves and mask when handling ill animals.10.There is no evidence that camel's milk tested positive for MERS, however, milk has the potential of transmitting other infections. Camel milk should be boiled before consumption. Unpasteurised milk should not be consumed11.There was no grounds for preventing children attending schools and closing schools\n",
