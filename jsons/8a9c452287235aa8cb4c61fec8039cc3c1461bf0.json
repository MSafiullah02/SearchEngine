We examined whether murine CD13/APN was similarly implicated in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) disease. MCMV infection did induce anti-CD13 antibodies in mice in a strainspecific manner. ICR and 129S mice developed high titers of anti-CD13 antibodies and anti-MCMV antibodies after MCMV infection, whereas CBA and CBAxC57BL/6 f1 hybrid mice produced antibodies against MCMV only. Unlike HCMV, no evidence was found for a correlation between host cell CD13/APN expression and infection, or for the presence of CD13/APN on MCMV particles, although APN inhibitors decreased MCMV plaque formation.

Several findings have implicated CD13, also known as aminopeptidase N (APN), in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and pathogenesis. In a series of bone marrow transplant patients, CD13/APN-specific autoantibodies were found only in patients with confirmed CMV disease after transplant and were highly associated with later development of chronic graft vs. host disease (cGVHD) (Soderberg et al., 1996a (Soderberg et al., , 1996b . Patients seropositive for CMV but negative for the presence of virus did not develop anti-CD13/APN antibodies or cGVHD (Soderberg et al., 1996b) . On the molecular level, several groups have shown that human CMV incorporates host cell proteins, one of which is CD13/ APN, into its viral envelope (Homman-Loudiyi et al., 2003; Michelson et al., 1989; Naucler et al., 1996; Wright et al., 1995) . Some monoclonal antibodies raised against CD13/ APN can neutralize human CMV viral particles, and immunoblots of purified human CMV virions detect CD13/APN (Soderberg et al., 1993a) . When viral particles are labeled with immunogold-anti-CD13 antibodies, the immunogold particles are later seen on the surface of infected cells (Giugni et al., 1996) . Consistent with viral sequestration of CD13/APN, cell surface CD13/APN is down-regulated after human CMV infection in fibroblasts (Phillips et al., 1998) . Association of CD13/APN with the viral particle has been suggested as a mechanism for the generation of anti-CD13/APN antibodies after CMV infection by autoimmunization (Naucler et al., 1996) . That virusassociated CD13/APN is essential for HCMV infection is suggested by anti-CD13 antibody inhibition of infection (Soderberg et al., 1993a) ; however, human neuroblastoma cells lacking CD13 expression were susceptible to HCMV infection (Watanabe, 1998) , and recently the epidermal growth factor receptor has been shown to be an important mediator of HCMV entry into cells (Wang et al., 2003) . CD13/APN is a membrane-bound metalloproteinase widely expressed on mammalian cells including monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts (Curnis et al., 2002; Phillips et al., 1998; Plakidou-Dymock et al., 1993; Riemann et al., 1999) . It exists as a heavily glycosylated homodimer with a constitutively active proteinase activity external to the plasma membrane (Riemann et al., 1999) . In addition to numerous tissuespecific functions, CD13/APN serves as a major receptor for type I coronaviruses (Breslin et al., 2003; Yeager et al., 1992) , including possibly the SARS virus (Yu et al., 2003) . More recently, CD13/APN has been shown to be an important mediator of angiogenesis when expressed on endothelial cells of nascent blood vessels (Bhagwat et al., 2001) . Antibodies raised against CD13/APN and inhibitors of aminopeptidase activity both block angiogenesis in models of neovascularization (Pasqualini et al., 2000) . This may have significance with regard to CMV, since CMV infection is associated with many chronic vascular diseases (Borchers et al., 1999; Hamamdzic et al., 2002; Nieto et al., 1996; Pandey and LeRoy, 1998) .

Groups of 4-6 animals of each of these strains were infected with 10 5 PFU MCMV by IP injection, which is a sublethal dose in adult animals for all strains. Serum was collected after 14 days and analyzed by ELISA for IgG antibodies against MCMV and mouse CD13/APN. All strains had similar levels of IgG antibodies directed against MCMV (Fig. 1) .

Anti-CD13 antibodies in humans were reported in people who developed HCMV viremia while in an immunocompromised state. In order to test whether an immunocompromised state would be associated with induction of higher levels anti-CD13 antibodies in mice, cyclosporine Awas used to induce an immunocompromised state in ICR mice. Three groups of 6 ICR mice were treated with either cyclosporine A alone, cyclosporine A and 10 5 PFU MCMV, or 10 5 PFU MCMV + mock cyclosporine A injections.

In contrast, CBA and CBA/B6 hybrids are known to be genetically resistant to MCMVinduced mortality. MCMV resistance in mice is determined largely by the gene cmv1, which encodes Ly49H, an NK cell receptor which is activated by the MCMV protein m157 (Arase et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2002; Swihart et al., 1995) . MCMV-resistant mouse strains have peak spleen viral titers that are 2-3 logs lower and LD 50 doses that are 1-2 logs higher than susceptible strains. CBA and C57BL/6 mice express Ly49H on their NK cells and are resistant whereas 129S mice do not express Ly49H and are susceptible. The ICR mice were not genotyped for cmv1 and were intermediate in their susceptibility to MCMV morbidity, as well as autoantibody production. This suggests that high spleen titers may be associated with development of anti-CD13 antibodies. MHC type does not seem to be correlated with anti-CD13 antibody production in our experiments, since the haplotype H-2 b is shared by both productive 129S and non-productive C57BL/6 hybrid strains. In the human system, it has been proposed that anti-CD13/APN antibodies occur as a result of autoimmunization by CD13/APN incorporated into HCMV viral envelopes. We were unable to find evidence of CD13/APN incorporation into MCMV viral particles, but this may be due to the limited variety of anti-CD13 antibodies available for the murine system. Neither antibody tested was able to detect CD13/APN on Western blots, and sc-15360 failed to detect CD13/APN even in native BBMV containing APN readily detected at a 1:80 dilution by antibody R3-242. It is possible that a more comprehensive array of anti-murine CD13/APN antibodies would have detected CD13/APN in MCMV particles or have been able to neutralize MCMV infectivity, however, APN enzymatic assays also failed to detect a difference between virus and control lysates. Cellsurface CD13/APN also did not correlate with MCMV susceptibility.

In this study, several factors argue against a simple case of molecular mimicry. Although human and mouse CD13/APN are 76% identical at the amino acid level (Chen et al., 1996) , HCMV and MCMV share less homology, CD13/APN is glycosylated and genetically polymorphic (Vijgen et al., 2004; Wentworth and Holmes, 2001) , and predicted MHC presentable peptides differ with MHC haplotype and species. Therefore, the likelihood of a single epitope common to both hosts, both viruses, and presentable by several MHC types seems small. Determination of the CD13/APN epitopes recognized by the sera of different mouse strains is currently underway and may allow identification of a viral antigen inducer if molecular mimicry is leading to the production of anti-CD13/APN antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 177, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 595, "end": 623, "text": "(Bartholomaeus et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 624, "end": 651, "text": "Cheng and Khairullah, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 652, "end": 677, "text": "Fairweather et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 678, "end": 698, "text": "Hebart et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 699, "end": 721, "text": "Hiemstra et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 722, "end": 741, "text": "Lipes et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 742, "end": 763, "text": "Lunardi et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1134, "text": "(Lawson, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1156, "text": "Naucler et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1335, "text": "(Chen et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1447, "text": "(Vijgen et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1475, "text": "Wentworth and Holmes, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Immunological processing of self-antigens as a result of virus-induced tissue damage is more difficult to examine. The association of CD13/APN autoantibodies with conditions favoring high in vivo titers is consistent with this mechanism. However, CD13/APN cannot credibly be described as a sequestered self-antigen in that it is normally expressed on the surface of numerous cell types throughout the body and is present in normal serum (Kawai et al., 2001) . Therefore, neither of the general mechanisms thought to give rise to virus-induced autoantibodies seems likely in the case of MCMV-induced CD13/APN antibodies. CMV seropositivity has long been associated with a variety of vasculopathies including atherosclerosis and systemic sclerosis (Borchers et al., 1999; Hamamdzic et al., 2002; Nieto et al., 1996; Pandey and LeRoy, 1998) . CMV infection has also long been recognized as a serious complication of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation because of vascular sequelae (Borchers et al., 1999; Matthes-Martin et al., 1998) . CMV viremia after bone marrow transplant is associated with a significant increase in chronic graft vs. host disease (cGVHD), which shares many features in common with the autoimmune disease scleroderma, and begins as an inflammation and destruction of small blood vessels (Pandey and LeRoy, 1998) . CMV viremia after solid organ transplant results in exacerbation of transplant vascular sclerosis leading to chronic graft rejection (Borchers et al., 1999) . The mechanism(s) by which CMV produces these negative outcomes is not understood, however, reduction of viral titers with anti-viral drugs decreases cGVHD, CMV-associated rejection, and vascular stenosis (Koskinen et al., 1999; Matthes-Martin et al., 1998) . Autoantibodies targeting an angiogenic factor such as CD13/APN may be one mechanism by which CMV could mediate these effects. The two mouse strains found to produce anti-CD13/APN antibodies in this study are also the strains most susceptible to CMV-induced vascular disease (Berencsi et al., 1998; Hamamdzic et al., 2001; Presti et al., 1998) . The fact that CMV induction of anti-CD13/APN antibodies is now reproduced in mice should make it possible to examine whether such antibodies play a part in CMV-induced vascular pathology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 457, "text": "(Kawai et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 746, "end": 769, "text": "(Borchers et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 770, "end": 793, "text": "Hamamdzic et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 794, "end": 813, "text": "Nieto et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 814, "end": 837, "text": "Pandey and LeRoy, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 986, "end": 1009, "text": "(Borchers et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1038, "text": "Matthes-Martin et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1338, "text": "(Pandey and LeRoy, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1497, "text": "(Borchers et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1727, "text": "(Koskinen et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1756, "text": "Matthes-Martin et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2056, "text": "(Berencsi et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2057, "end": 2080, "text": "Hamamdzic et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2081, "end": 2101, "text": "Presti et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Cells, medium, antibodies, FACS, immunoblotting SVEC-4, NIH 3T3, and NIH 3T12 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and grown as recommended.
