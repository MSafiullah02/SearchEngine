            "text": "The beginning of the 2007\u20132008 influenza season marked a significant and sudden increase in resistance of influenza A H1N1 to the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor oseltamivir through a histidine to tyrosine mutation at residue 275 of the NA gene (Sheu et al., 2008) (residue 274 in the N2 gene). By the end of the 2007\u20132008 influenza season the resistance rate to oseltamivir was 16% globally. Countries with little or no previous oseltamivir resistance, such as the United States, Canada and Norway reported resistance rates of 10%, 26% and 67% respectively (World Health Organization, 2008). Early data from the Southern Hemisphere for the 2008 influenza season suggested oseltamivir resistance rates among H1N1 isolates of as high as 100% (Besselaar et al., 2008). In addition to reports of resistance in seasonal H1N1 isolates, reports of oseltamivir resistance have also emerged in patients infected with H5N1 avian influenza (de Jong et al., 2005, Kimm-Breschkin et al., 2007, Le et al., 2005), bringing into question the use of this antiviral for pandemic influenza treatment and prophylaxis (Moscona, 2005, World Health Organization, 2005). This emerging oseltamivir resistance has prompted laboratorians to look at time effective means to identify H1N1 influenza with the H275Y mutation.",

            "text": "Currently, the gold standard for antiviral resistance screening is phenotypic methods (Meijer et al., 2007). However, genotypic methods such as Sanger dideoxy sequence analysis of the NA gene can also be performed to detect mutations such as H275Y that are associated strongly with oseltamivir resistance. While both phenotypic and sequencing methods are effective in detecting resistance, they can be labour intensive, have a long turn-around-time and be quite expensive, suggesting the need for a rapid, high-throughput approach to influenza drug resistance testing. In this study we introduce the utilization of a novel real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay for detection of the histidine to tyrosine mutation at residue 275. This assay is designed to produce a sigmoidal curve when an isolate is oseltamivir susceptible and no curve when an isolate is oseltamivir resistant, thus serving as a quick screening tool that can be incorporated into the influenza subtyping protocol.",

Due to these qualities MGB probes are characterized by a shorter length and a higher melting temperature (T\nm). MGB-based probes are therefore highly applicable for detecting the presence of polymorphic sequences (Uchiyama et al., 2004); however their increased stability may result in false positives. Probe cross reactivity is therefore one reason that MGB chemistry is not generally used to detect point mutations. To avoid incorrect assignment of the H275Y point mutation an effort was made to reduce binding to oseltamivir-resistant isolates which have a C\u2192T point mutation by designing the MGB probe to detect wild-type sequence only. To limit cross reactivity of similar sequences, the MGB probe was designed so that the MGB was linked to the mutable base pair. This was accomplished by designing the probe so that the C\u2192T mutation was 6 bp from the 3\u2032 of the probe, which is the site of MGB linkage.",

Upon arrival in the laboratory, neuraminidase (N1) was detected from specimens using the Quantitect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and published primers and probes (Schweiger et al., 2000) (Table 1\n) using an MxPro3005 real-time PCR thermocycler (Stratagene). This N1 subtyping assay has been validated previously as a sensitive and specific method for the detection of N1 in clinical specimens (Schweiger et al., 2000). It has also been used extensively in external quality assurance panels and classic phenotypic assays. Mutations at residue 275 of the N1 gene were detected using Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Forty specimens with a wild-type histidine at residue 275 and 61 specimens with a tyrosine at residue 275 were chosen randomly for analysis.",
