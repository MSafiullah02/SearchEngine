This fatal disease was caused by a newly identified coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Rota et al., 2003). SARS-CoV is a new kind of coronavirus that is significantly different from previously known ones (Stadler et al., 2003). It is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, which contains four structural proteins embedded on the surface of the viral particle (Stadler et al., 2003). Among them, it has been demonstrated that spike protein (S protein) is the important functional protein that mediates entry of the virus into susceptible cells. The S protein of SARS-CoV is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that consists of 1255 amino acids. It has two functional domains: S1 (aa. 1\u2013680) and S2 (aa. 681\u20131255) as predicted by sequence alignment with S proteins of other coronaviruses (Rota et al., 2003, Holmes, 2003).",

The functional portion within the S1 domain, which directly interacts with ACE2, has been identified as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Wong et al., 2004). It is located between aa. 318\u2013510 and has been proven to be a major neutralizing determinant (Wong et al., 2004, He et al., 2004a). It has been demonstrated that RBD can induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it can be considered an excellent candidate for development of a subunit vaccine against SARS (He et al., 2004a). Neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD can be generated by direct immunization of mice with inactivated SARS virus or RBD protein (He et al., 2004a, He et al., 2004b).",

They exhibit good neutralizing activity in a syncytia inhibition assay, a pseudovirus infection assay and a neutralization assay in SARS virus infected cells. A mapping experiment indicates that both mAbs recognize several discontinuous peptides (aa. 343\u2013367, 373\u2013390 and 411\u2013428) and that binding activity is conformation-dependent. Mutations of W423 and N424 completely abrogate binding activity of the RBD to the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. It was further revealed that W423 and N424 residues within a 411\u2013428 peptide are located adjoining the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the RBD, an important region holding the RBD\u2013ACE2 interaction surface. W423 and N424 are very stable among 107 different strains of SARS (Song et al., 2005), indicating that the mAbs would possibly possess a broad neutralizing spectrum. A human\u2013mouse chimeric antibody was thus constructed based upon the N-176-15 mAb. It retained a high affinity (KD = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u2212 10 M) as compared to the original murine mAb (KD = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u2212 9 M).

Results indicated a significant inhibition of pseudovirus infection achieved by use of S-9-11 and N-176-15 mAbs (Fig. 3A). The experiments revealed that the mAbs could block the infection of SARS pseudovirus into target Vero E6 cells through interference with S protein and ACE2 interaction. Secondly, we evaluated neutralizing activity of the mAbs in SARS virus-infected FRhK-4 cells. A serial 2-fold dilution (beginning at 1:80) was carried out to arrive at the highest dilution rate allowing a complete suppression of CPE induced by the virus in at least 5 of 10 wells. When mAb S-9-11 ascites was tested, it showed a marked neutralizing effect upon SARS virus infection with a dilution titer at 1:5000. In additional experiments, mAb N-176-15 ascites showed a similar neutralizing effect (data not shown).

Initially, the synthetic peptides were coated on plates and their reactivity with the mAbs tested by ELISA. Unexpectedly, the reactivity was undetectable (data not shown). Subsequently, a dot-blot experiment was employed. To guarantee its success, we first tested the overlapping peptides with our laboratory-prepared rabbit anti-Spike S1 polyclonal antibodies recognizing S1 protein from amino acid residues 1 to 678 (Wu et al., 2004). Results showed that the anti-S1 polyclonal antibodies clearly recognized several peptides with different binding intensities, which depended upon their different antigenicities (Fig. 4A). As expected, the pAb did not react with HA peptide (negative control). The data demonstrated the utility of this system. From this experiment, we were able to identify three major antigenic regions: peptides no. 6\u20137 (aa. 343\u2013367), no. 10\u201315 (aa. 373\u2013428), and no. 19\u201322 (aa. 442\u2013478) (Fig. 4A). We then tested the binding activity of the mAbs with these peptides. Results showed that both mAbs were able to bind the same peptides: no.6, 7, 10 and 15, which represented amino acid residues 343\u2013367, 373\u2013390 and 411\u2013428 (Table 1, Figs. 4B and C). The no. 8 peptide position also demonstrated a mild binding signal but was too weak to be considered recognizable. It was also shown that the two mAbs (S-9-11 and N-176-15) recognized the same peptides indicating they share the same epitope. Although the mAbs recognized a conformational epitope, we were still able to use dot-blot analysis to detect peptide reactivity and to analyze epitopes recognized by the mAbs within the whole RBD region.",

We mutated the amino acids of the five sites into alanines (Table 2\n), generated mutated RBD-Fc with transient transfection and determined their binding activity with the mAbs using a sandwich ELISA (Fig. 6\n).

A SPR experiment was carried out to determine the binding affinity of the chimeric antibody with the RBD. The data indicates that both the chimeric antibody and the murine mAb show a very high binding affinity with the RBD, their KDs being 1.6 \u00d7 10\u2212 10 M and 2.0 \u00d7 10\u2212 9 M respectively.

It has been revealed that the RBD contains various linear and conformational epitopes and that most of the neutralizing epitopes are conformational ones (He et al., 2005). Although the neutralizing antibodies show a higher affinity, the spatial profiles of these conformational epitopes had not been well understood. There have also been some studies on functionally important amino acids or segments of the RBD. It was reported that the deletion of a positively charged region (422\u2013463) on the RBD protein abolished the capacity of the S protein to induce neutralizing antibodies (Yi et al., 2005). It was also reported that a single amino acid substitution (R441A) in the full-length S DNA vaccine failed to induce neutralizing antibodies or to abolish viral entry (Yi et al., 2005). These results indicated that particular portions of and amino acids on the RBD are crucial for retaining the RBD's normal function. However, whether critical amino acids or segments exist in conformational neutralizing epitopes was still not known. The crystal structure of the RBD\u2013ACE2 complex has been identified, introducing detailed information concerning RBD structure and function (Li et al., 2005). The structure revealed that the RBD could be further divided into 2 separate subdomains. One is the RBD core and the other is the RBD loop (RPM) (aa. 424\u2013494). The RBD loop is the region that directly contacts the ACD2 molecule. The RBD core, on the other hand, makes contact with accessory proteins (Li et al., 2005). The epitope recognized by a humanized neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 80R, has been mapped and its crucial amino acid residues on the RBD loop region binding to the neutralizing mAb has been determined (Sui et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2005).

Here we used a modified recombinant vaccinia virus Ankara with SARS S protein on the surface as the antigen with which to immunize mice. The results show that this vaccinia virus was able to elicit high titers of neutralizing antibodies (Chen et al., 2005). Therefore, it appears to be an ideal immunizing antigen for generation of monoclonal antibodies as well as a possible vaccine candidate. For screening of hybridoma clones, we used mammalian-cell expressed RBD-Fc protein, whose natural conformation is well preserved.
