Hepatomegaly may be present in some patients, especially those with acute hepatitis. Many animals with hepatitis do not have any of these physical abnormalities present on the initial examination, and serum biochemical changes in those cases are likely to direct the clinician toward the liver as the site of disease.",

Endotoxins work via various mechanisms, most of which involve stimulation of inflammatory cells to produce inflammatory mediators (cytokines such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes) that perpetuate inflammation within the liver parenchyma. Experimental work in mouse models suggests an important role for tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in the initiation and perpetuation of hepatitis. TNF-\u03b1, produced secondary to the interaction of the costimulatory molecules CD154 on T cells and CD40 on hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, stimulates hepatocyte apoptosis through the Fas-Fas ligand pathway.4 A better understanding of the complex mechanisms of hepatocellular injury in animals with hepatitis may encourage the development of novel therapeutic modalities for affected patients.",

This disease can be seen in acute and chronic stages. In acute neutrophilic cholangitis (ANC), edema and neutrophilic inflammation may extend into the portal areas. In chronic neutrophilic cholangitis (CNC), a mixed inflammatory infiltrate may be noted in portal areas, along with varying degrees of fibrosis and bile duct hyperplasia.7 This syndrome was referred to previously as acute cholangiohepatitis or suppurative cholangitis-cholangiohepatitis.\n8, 9 NC can occur in cats of any age, breed, or sex. Clinical signs are nonspecific and include anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, and weight loss. The duration of these clinical signs ranges from a few days to a few months and may be shorter in cats with ANC than in those with CNC,8 but this is not a consistent finding.10, 11 Physical examination findings commonly include dehydration and icterus. Fever is present in 19% to 37.5% of cases.10, 12 Some reports suggest that fever is associated more commonly with ANC than CNC,12 whereas others recognize no difference.10, 11 Hepatomegaly is seen in fewer than half of the cases and abdominal pain is noted occasionally.8, 10, 11 Biochemical analysis commonly reveals increased activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) ranging in severity from mild to severe. However, increased liver enzyme activity may be absent in some cases.13 Cholangitis in cats has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pancreatitis,12 and many investigators believe that NC is the result of an ascending bacterial infection from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, rates of bacterial isolation using traditional methods have varied greatly, from less than 20% to more than 60% in affected cats.8, 10 When isolated, common bacterial species include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Clostridium spp., and Staphylococcus spp. Samples for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures should be obtained in any cat suspected of having cholangitis; gallbladder bile is preferred to liver tissue as the culture source.14 Treatment with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, focusing on enteric flora, is recommended pending results of culture and susceptibility testing. Prognosis for cats with NC is typically good with aggressive treatment, although sequelae may include bile duct obstruction, acute necrotizing pancreatitis, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction.",

Corticosteroids are the only class of drug shown potentially to provide benefit19 and their use is indicated in patients with signs of hepatic failure. Other immunomodulatory drugs that may be used include ursodeoxycholic acid, metronidazole, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. Colchicine may delay progression of hepatic fibrosis. Copper chelation may be beneficial when copper retention is a significant contributing factor. The overall prognosis is difficult to ascertain because asymptomatic animals may have a slowly progressive course and excellent prognosis.

This disease has become rare because of extensive vaccination protocols using the cross-reacting adenovirus type II vaccine. As such, the disease is seen only in young, unvaccinated dogs. The degree of antibody response determines the severity of disease, with a poor response resulting in an acutely fatal syndrome. Animals that mount an appropriate response may recover or develop CH. Corneal edema and anterior uveitis may develop in animals that recover from acute illness. The diagnosis is made by histopathologic identification of large basophilic to amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies within hepatocytes and Kupffer cells that are identified during the first week of infection.15 Histopathology also reveals multifocal coagulative necrosis and a neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate that may not be present in animals with severe acute infection.",

The commonly isolated serovars in small animals include Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, Leptospira canicola, Leptospira pomona, Leptospira hardjo, Leptospira grippotyphosa, and Leptospira bratislava. Infection in dogs most commonly results in acute renal failure, although hepatic involvement may occur in 20% to 35% of cases.3, 23 Other clinical manifestations of infection include pulmonary hemorrhage, uveitis, and acute fever.24 Infection in young animals and infection with serovars L. icterohaemorrhagiae and L. pomona are more likely to result in hepatic involvement.25 Affected dogs may show acute hepatitis or develop chronic hepatitis with subclinical acute infection. Although cats are generally resistant to leptospirosis, experimental infection with L. pomona has caused hepatic lesions in this species.3 Patients with hepatic involvement show increased activity of hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP), although ALP often is affected most severely. Hyperbilirubinemia and signs of hepatic failure may occur. Diagnosis of leptospirosis usually is based on clinical suspicion because of renal and hepatic involvement combined with serologic evidence of infection. However, antibody titers may be negative during the first week of infection, and antibody production may persist for only 2 to 6 weeks.3 Suspected patients with negative antibody titers and a short duration of illness should be treated as though they have leptospirosis, and antibody titers should be repeated in 2 weeks. Histopathologic changes in the liver of affected animals may include coagulative necrosis and infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells with lesser numbers of neutrophils and macrophages. Organisms may be identified in biopsy specimens with silver staining, but this is an insensitive diagnostic test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to detect organisms in blood and urine samples are available. These techniques have not been well studied in dogs with clinical disease, but they are likely to make this diagnosis less challenging in the future. Historically, treatment recommendations have included penicillin to eliminate the leptospiremic stage, followed by doxycycline to eliminate the carrier state. However, treatment with doxycycline alone is effective for the leptospiremic stage and carrier state (5 mg/kg PO/IV q12h).24 Penicillins may be used in animals that do not tolerate doxycycline. Alternative antibiotic choices include azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime.24 Prognosis is typically good, but patients often require intensive supportive care, including hemodialysis in animals with oliguric or anuric renal failure. Pulmonary involvement worsens prognosis.",

Histologic examination of hepatic tissue from dogs with B. henselae infection has revealed peliosis hepatis28 and granulomatous hepatitis,27 both of which have been described in infected humans. Diagnosis was made via identification of Bartonella DNA using PCR techniques on hepatic biopsy specimens. This is the preferred method of diagnosis because serologic assays impart information only regarding exposure, and granulomatous hepatitis may be caused by other agents. The cause of granulomatous hepatitis in dogs frequently is unknown, although reported causes include fungal infection, mycobacterial infection, dirofilariasis, lymphoma, histiocytosis, and intestinal lymphangiectasia.29 Azithromycin is the antibiotic of choice for treatment of bartonellosis, although its use in dogs with hepatic disease caused by Bartonella spp. has not been evaluated thoroughly.
