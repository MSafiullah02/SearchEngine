In spite of WHO recommendations,3 a South Korean strategy of mass testing, contact tracing, and physical distancing was not adopted in France and Italy, and the biggest step was a lockdown of the country as late as March 9 in Italy and March 17 in France. France did not have the logistic capacity to promote mass testing, due to the limited number of accredited laboratories (only 45 in public facilities) and the limited availability of SARS-COV-2 reagents for RT-PCR. But, rather than explicitly setting the goal of scaling up testing with priorities (health-care professionals, vulnerable groups) until capacities became sufficient, authorities argued that systematic testing was not needed as soon as the epidemic had generalised (phase 3 of national guidelines).4 This policy was only reversed on March 28, with the aim of managing a way out from the lockdown.5\n",
