Since its inception in December 2019, the number of cases is rising exponentially worldwide. Since this is a novel virus, the human population does not have any prior immunity to fight against the disease nor there is any vaccine or therapy available [2]. The median duration of viral shedding is reported to be 20.0 days (IQR 17.0\u201324.0) [3, 4]. Hence, it is anticipated that the infection will remain at least for another 2\u20133 months before clearing. The impact of COVID-19 is substantial and has caused enormous economic, social and healthcare disruption worldwide. COVID-19 infection has been observed to cause mild illness and recovery in the majority (80%) of cases, more severe illness is seen in 14% cases, and only about 6% cases develop critical illness [5]. The risk of death is higher in those with higher SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score (5.65, 2.61\u201312.23; p < 0.0001), d-dimer > 1 \u00b5g/L (18.42, 2.64\u2013128.55; p = 0.003). The impact of the illness is highest in the elderly (odds ratio 1.10; 95% CI 1.03\u20131.17; p = 0.0043), and those with known comorbid illnesses including cancer [4].",

However, the current unprecedented lockdown enforced to reduce community transmission poses an ethical challenge to gynaecologic oncologists as there is insufficient evidence to determine the impact of this novel infection on cancer care and therefore no clarity on how women with gynaecological cancers should be managed in this critical time.",

The only paper published is a nation-wide analysis from China, in which only 18 (1%) out of 1590 COVID positive cases had a history of cancer [7]. Of these, six were women, but there was no case of gynaecological cancer\u2014three had carcinoma breast, one had thyroid cancer and two had lung cancer. Overall, 5 (18%) of the cancer cases had carcinoma lung. The treatment history of two cases was not known, 25% (4/16) had received either surgery or chemotherapy in the past 1 month, and the remaining 12 cases were cancer survivors on routine follow-up. It was observed that patients with cancer were older (mean age 63.1 years vs. 48.7 years), had more tachypnoea (47% vs. 23%) and had more severe baseline findings on chest computed tomography (94% vs. 71%). There was no difference in gender, other baseline symptoms, comorbidities or baseline severity of chest radiographs. Risk of severe events defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, need for mechanical ventilation or death was higher in cancer patients than in the general population (39% vs. 8%; p = 0.0003). History of cancer was found to be the most significant risk factor for severe events after adjusting for other risk factors including age, comorbidities and history of smoking (odds ratio 5.34, 95% CI 1.80\u201316.18; p = 0.0026). Similarly, the risk of rapid deterioration was also greater in those with history of cancer (HR 3.56; 95% CI 1.65\u20137.69). Patients who underwent surgery or chemotherapy in the past 1 month had a higher risk of severe events (75% vs. 43%). Patients with history of lung cancer did not have an increased probability of deterioration [7]. The study emphasized that cancer patients are particularly at risk for adverse outcome and rapid deterioration because of their systemic immunosuppressive state due to malignancy, previous recent or ongoing therapy.",

For low-risk endometrial cancer, the risk of death increased if surgery was conducted after the 8th week of diagnosis. Subsequently, the 5-year survival was 16% inferior for cases who underwent surgery after 4 months of diagnosis than for patients who underwent surgery within 3 weeks. Conversely, for high-risk disease, a delay of up to 21 weeks did not have a significant impact on survival in this study [10]. Interestingly, rapid surgery within the first week of diagnosis also had an adverse impact on survival [10, 11].",

            "text": "The majority of ovarian malignancies are diagnosed in advanced stages, and further delay may have a detrimental effect on the outcome. However, the timing of initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy also has a direct impact on survival. According to a meta-analysis by Liu et al. [12], the overall survival was worse in women in whom administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was delayed more than 6 weeks (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06\u20131.32). Hence, on the one hand if delay in therapy is detrimental, the risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death is 3.5 times more if they acquire COVID-19 infection. These factors have to be taken into consideration in the decision on whether to treat immediately or delay the definitive surgery; if surgery is done, it needs to be ascertained whether it will be feasible to administer adjuvant therapy within 3\u20136 weeks of surgery as per the standard practice. Counselling patients, allaying their anxiety and calming the fear of delay in therapy versus the risk of therapy in the current compromised healthcare scenario is another challenge that needs to be addressed on an individual basis. Moreover, the reality of exhausted supplies and limited resources is another unprecedented situation [3, 4]. Availability of ICU beds and ventilators is a real challenge presently. It is speculated that channelling diagnostic, therapeutic (surgical, medical or radiation oncology) and ICU resources for care of cancer cases will be in direct conflict with COVID-19 services as this pandemic progress, but this has ethical concerns as well. Safety of healthcare workers and limited availability of COVID-19 testing along with judicious use of PPE need further attention. The major concern for cancer patients now is getting admitted in hospital and receiving definitive therapy after admission which may be delayed or denied owing to resource diversion [13].",

According to GLOBOCAN estimates, there were 96,922 new cases of cervical cancer, 13,328 new cases of endometrial and 36,170 new cases of ovarian cancer in India in 2018 [14]. Approximately 70% of gynaecological cancer cases present in advanced stages (Table 1), around 20% default during the preliminary work-up and another 30% default after starting adjuvant therapy. These factors result in poor survival and high mortality rates [15]. The disease stage remains the most important prognostic variable affecting survival [16]. The 5-year DFS was 56% in women with cervical cancer when they were diagnosed in stage IIb, but it reduced to 40% when the disease was more advanced [17]. Similarly, the 5-year OS in ovarian cancer is reduced to 30% and 15% when the disease is diagnosed in stage III and stage IV, respectively, as compared to stage II when survival is as good as 65% [18]. The patients with endometrial cancer who present with advanced stage were at higher risk of relapse (HR 5.78; 95% CI 1.18\u201328.57) and death (HR 6.89; 95% CI 1.76\u201327.02) [19].

The following practical points may be considered while considering reinstallation of cancer care services if the COVID crisis continues in India:Since it is preferred that women with suspected cervical cancer should ideally receive diagnostic evaluation within 4 weeks from the initial presentation, such cases may be scheduled for diagnostic conization/LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision) after careful counselling and evaluation. Those with high grade lesions on cytology screening may wait up to 3 months and those with low grade lesions may be counselled for following up after the crisis is resolved (6\u201312 months) [26].Women with early cervical cancer who have been waiting for the last 6\u20138 weeks should be re-evaluated for operability and COVID census and resources. Definitive surgery is preferred if resources permit; otherwise NACT may be considered in situations with ongoing crises beyond 8 weeks.In women with low-risk uterine cancer, who have been waiting or expected to delay beyond 6\u20138 weeks, a non-surgical option may be considered after careful selection of cases. Conversely, high-risk cases may be taken for surgery on priority even in extended lockdown situation. In cases with advanced or recurrent disease, a confirmatory biopsy may be taken, and systemic therapy or hormonal therapy may be considered.In an extended lock down situation and ongoing crisis, women with ovarian cancer should be carefully counselled and continue with NACT and may complete all 6 cycles, but if surgical services can be resumed, they should be considered as priority. However, the impact of chemotherapy on immunity and increased susceptibility to COVID infection remain a concern. If possible, a COVID screen may be done prior to surgery for such cases. Those with yolk sac tumours should be provided surgical staging and chemotherapy at the earliest possible time because of higher risk of disease progression and compromised outcome.For rare cancers like vulva and vagina, neoadjuvant chemoradiation may be considered.",
