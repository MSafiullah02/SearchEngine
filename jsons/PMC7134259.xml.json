Bhandari et al. [24] performed a study on classical aesthetics (described with the dimensions of symmetry, clarity and cleanliness) and expressive aesthetics (with the dimensions of originality, creativity and special effects), and found that both classical and expressive aesthetics had a significant effect on user emotional states. Classical aesthetics significantly affects the valence (pleasure) dimension of emotions, while expressive aesthetics reflects in the arousal dimension of emotion [24]. Another paper found that beautiful web-pages had a similar effect as pleasant pictures, and ugly web-pages to that of unpleasant pictures [23]. Ugly webpages induced a negative affective state, while pleasant web pages influenced the affective state of the user towards the positive end [23]. A study on the visual complexity of a webpage found that it bears a positive correlation to the arousal and pleasantness experienced by the user [25]. Design aesthetics of an m-commerce site was shown to positively influence the perceived enjoyment by the user, and it was shown that perceived enjoyment is as important to the loyalty of a user as perceived usefulness [22]. Based on these studies it can be said that practitioners can use different general aesthetic characteristics or interventions, such as symmetry, clarity and cleanliness, and expressive aesthetic qualities (creativity, special effects and originality) to evoke a positive affective state in users [24]. Practitioners that implement attractive design aesthetics are more likely to influence the perceived enjoyment of users [22, 23].",
