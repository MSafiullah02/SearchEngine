However, most studies did not include respiratory viruses beyond RSV and the majority did not report beyond the first few months of life. The proportion of RVIs in our inpatient predischarge setting of 1.7% was much lower than the 4%\u201352% incidence reported in other NICU studies [6, 15, 22]. The higher incidence in previous studies is likely due to the differences in study design, where these studies performed periodic surveillance testing for RVI. Our study included only symptomatic infants with an RVI during their admission. This approach may have missed infants with mild symptoms or who were asymptomatic. Furthermore, differences in testing methodology such as primary usage of multiplex PCR may account for the differences in incidence. Our lower RVI rate could also possibly be attributable to the strict enforcement of infection control policies in our department, which are similar to those in published infection prevention guidelines [17, 23]. Even so, guidelines specific to the neonatal setting is lacking and the effectiveness of most interventions has not been systematically studied. Differences in testing strategy and laboratory methodology also likely accounted for the lack of viral codetection in our study, which has been reported in other pediatric studies [4, 6, 24]. Most surveillance studies reporting virus codetection primarily utilized sensitive PCR techniques [25, 26], compared with our 11% respiratory virus detection via PCR.",

It is difficult to extrapolate data from these studies to the tropics as differences in climatic factors and year-round circulation of RSV are likely to affect transmission patterns and exposure risk among preterm infants in tropical regions. Specifically, studies of RSV from temperate countries have reported a broad range of RSV hospitalization rates, from 2% to 19% in preterm infants [27\u201332].

Specifically, apart from RSV, we noted PIV and rhinovirus to be common in the predischarge period, accounting for up to 45% of all RVIs [8]. There is limited information on the incidence and morbidity of PIV infections in preterm infants, with most reports coming from outbreaks. PIV infections can result in lower respiratory tract infections with significant morbidity [34, 35].
