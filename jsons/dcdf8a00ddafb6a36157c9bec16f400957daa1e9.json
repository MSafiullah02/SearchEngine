However, as yet, there is limited understanding of its impact on the mental health of the general population. The aim of this study is to examine the mental health of the Japanese general population by conducting the first systematic survey during the pandemic (N=1,000), with a particular focus on identifying the most vulnerable groups. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that the mental health of young and middle-aged individuals was significantly worse than that of older individuals during the pandemic. There was also some indication that individuals who were not currently working were significantly more likely to report a high level of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Part-time and temporary contract-based workers were also more likely to suffer from anxiety disorder. Our results highlight that monitoring the mental health of younger and economically vulnerable individuals may be especially important. In addition, they also indicate that population mental health might not only be affected by the direct health consequences of COVID-19, but also by the economic ramifications of the pandemic.",

Despite the potential benefits of such measures, it is also being increasingly recognized that they might also have both negative short-and long-term consequences for mental health (Galea et al., 2020) that are in addition to those resulting from the disease itself (Du et al., 2020) . For example, a recent review article has shown that quarantine may be associated with a number of negative psychological outcomes such as anger and posttraumatic stress, with factors such as financial loss and the socioeconomic distress that can result from quarantine possibly underpinning the emergence of psychological disorders (Brooks et al., 2020) .",

First, studies on earlier global infectious disease outbreaks such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (2002) (2003) (2004) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome occurrence (MERS; 2012-) have indicated that the spread of infectious disease is linked to worse mental health within and across populations (Jeong et al., 2016; Lau et al., 2005) . Second, recent studies from China have similarly shown that COVID-19 may be important for mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms (Ahmed et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; . Third, it is possible that COVID-19 may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations (Wang and Tang, 2020) with groups such as older adults, those with co-occurring illnesses, the socially excluded (e.g. the homeless) and individuals on low incomes all being at increased risk for poorer mental health (Holmes et al., 2020) . Given the lack of evidence, determining who is vulnerable to the mental health consequences of COVID-19 is essential for the design and implementation of evidence-based interventions to mitigate the potential effects of COVID-19 on population mental health.",

Following an upsurge in 'untraceable' new infections the state of emergency was expanded to cover the whole of Japan and thirteen prefectures were designated as \"special alert areas\" on April 16 (Looi, 2020b) , which coincided with the start date of our study. Although there is no comprehensive data as yet, there is nevertheless some indication that these COVID-19-related events may be having a negative impact on population wellbeing in Japan. For example, the prospect of a possible forthcoming lockdown resulted in panic buying of food and other household products in Tokyo at the end of March (Reuters, 2020) , while a recent international poll showed that 86% of the Japanese population were afraid of catching the virus which was a higher percentage than in other high-income countries such as the United States and United Kingdom where approximately 60% of the population expressed that they were scared of contracting COVID-19 (YouGov 2020). Importantly, it is also possible that these events may have had an especially damaging impact of some people's economic situation, as the Japanese government announced that the economy is now 'rapidly deteriorating' for the first time since 2009 (Cabinet Office 2020).",

In particular, we hypothesize that older adults may be especially at risk for poorer mental health given the higher COVID-19 mortality rates among those aged 70 and above, as well as economically vulnerable individuals due to the possible economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In connection with this, the Japanese government had initially planned to distribute a cash benefit of 300,000 yen to each household provided that the head of the household had lost a significant portion of their income, but then changed the planned policy in mid-April so that all residents in Japan would receive 100,000 yen per person (Kyodo News 2020). While funds are expected to reach residents faster under the current universal policy, many small-sized households that have been economically affected will receive less money than they would have done under the previous policy. This suggests that the government should employ both universal and targeted policies so that the needs of the most economically vulnerable are met during this unprecedented crisis.",
