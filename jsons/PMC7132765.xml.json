            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are responsible for substantial morbidity in both pediatric and adult populations. Timely and accurate diagnosis of these infections is essential to patient care in settings as diverse as susceptible infants or children, older adults, patients with compromised immune systems, or individuals with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases (Glezen et al., 2000, Weinberg et al., 2004). Early diagnosis of respiratory viruses plays an important role in clinical management, reducing complications, antibiotic use, and unnecessary laboratory testing (Jernigan et al., 2011, Mahony et al., 2009, Renaud et al., 2012). The Seeplex RV12 ACE detection kit (RV12; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) enables simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory viruses in 2 reactions per sample using dual priming oligonucleotides as PCR primers. The performance of RV12 has been demonstrated in previous studies, showing time and resource savings (Bibby et al., 2011, Drews et al., 2008, Weinberg et al., 2004, Yoo et al., 2007). Recently, Anyplex\u2122 II RV16 detection (V1.1) kit (RV16; Seegene) with tagging oligonucleotide cleavage and extension (TOCE) technology has been developed. TOCE technology is a novel approach to real-time PCR, using the 2 components, the Pitcher and Catcher, to accomplish a unique signal generation. Through target bound Pitcher, TOCE assay moves the detection point from the target sequence to the Catcher. By designing unique Catchers, the resulting Duplex Catcher will have a predictable melting temperature profile (Cho et al., 2013, Chun, 2012, Lee, 2012). Both RV16 and RV12 achieved approval from CE, Health Canada, and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of Korea, being sold in more than 15 countries in Europe, Canada, and Asia. RV16 simultaneously detects 16 respiratory viruses: human bocavirus (HBoV); human enterovirus (HEV); influenza virus (INF) types A and B; parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, 3, and 4; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B; adenovirus (ADV); human metapneumovirus (HMPV); coronavirus (CoV) OC43, 229E, and NL63; and human rhinovirus (HRV). This profile is similar to the profile of RV12 but further includes HBoV, HEV, PIV 4, CoV 229E, and CoV NL63.",

            "text": "Majority of the samples that were identified as positive from RV16 assays were confirmed as positive by monoplex real-time RT-PCR and gene sequencing. However, in the discrepant RV16-positive and the RV12-negative results for INF A, monoplex PCR and sequencing revealed that 50% were negative. This suggests the false positivity for INF A in RV16 assay by nucleic acid contamination or cross-reactivity from spurious primer interactions. However, the possibility that the RV16 may detect INF A with superior sensitivity compared to the monoplex PCR and sequencing cannot be excluded. Recent studies reported on the performance of RV16, which showed increased sensitivities compared to the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 ACE detection kit (RV15; Seegene), although we did not determine the diagnostic accuracy against a reference method (Cho et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2013).",

Nevertheless, the internal control in RV16 cannot give information for specimen quality or prevent misjudgment from sampling error, since it is an exogenous control.",

Third, we used the same primers for RV12 and RV16 in the monoplex PCR and sequencing for discrepant analysis.
