Haplotypes for all SNPs of each gene were predicted using the Phase 2.0.2 program [26]. For each SNP, univariate analysis was performed by comparing the frequencies of alleles and genotypes between patients with or without detectable SARS-CoV in nasopharyngeal specimens. Tests for models of dominant/recessive or codominant traits were performed to identify the susceptible genotypes of the SNP. The empirical P value was calculated using the permutation test of 10,000 rounds for each SNP for which an association with the virus load was demonstrated. Tests of significance that were performed included the \u03c72 test, the Cochran-Armitage trend test, Fisher's exact test, and the exact Mantel-Haenszel test. The continuous variables (i.e., age and virus load) were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, to analyze factors that could have potentially affected the virus load, including demographic characteristics, the source of infection, and the duration of illness. Associations between nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV shedding and multiple variables were analyzed simultaneously in a cumulative logistic model. Interactions between genes were tested in a cumulative logistic model for virus detection.",

Although a longitudinal study of patients with SARS indicated that the nasopharyngeal virus load increased between the fifth and the 10th days of illness and decreased by the 15th day of illness [2], the virus loads at the time of admission of all patients with SARS in our data set did not reflect this trend of a rise and fall occurring during the first 2 weeks of the clinical course of SARS. Rather, on any given day within the first week of the clinical course of SARS, the nasopharyngeal virus load in different patients ranged widely. Overall, 111 (41.9%) of 265 patients with SARS had an undetectable level of nasopharyngeal virus shedding, and this lack of detection of virus did not correlate with the time of specimen collection, because successive samples were obtained from these patients, and the test results for these specimens remained negative.",

Among patients with SARS, undetectable levels of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV shedding were found more often among female patients (50.0%) than among male patients (27.4%), and they were also found more often among younger patients (53.1% of patients <30 years of age) than among older patients (37.7% of patients \u2a7e30 years of age) (table 2 and figure 2). When only the virus titer of patients with detectable virus shedding was the focus of investigation, female patients consistently shed lower titers of virus than did male patients (P = .045, by the multivariate logistic regression model). Furthermore, in a multivariate cumulative logistic regression model in which (1) the date of sample collection was controlled, and (2) any underlying diseases and the source of infection (identifiable or not) were considered simultaneously, female sex (P = .001) and younger age (P = .005) were independently associated with a lower virus load, whereas having an underlying disease or a known source of infection did not influence virus shedding. Because the lack of virus detection may be the result of lower levels of virus shedding occurring at the time of sample collection during the early (<5 days of illness) or later (>15 days of illness) clinical phase of disease [2], the multivariate model confirmed that nasopharyngeal specimens in which levels of virus shedding were undetectable were collected at the same time relative to disease onset as were specimens in which virus levels were detectable; lack of detection of virus did not correlate with early sample collection.",

In the present report, we showed the dramatic interindividual difference in virus burden and the direct correlation of such virus burden with clinical outcomes. Our analysis further indicated that a high SARS-CoV load is associated with early death, in addition to a high mortality rate, as previously reported elsewhere [10\u201312]. Therefore, our results suggest that (1) the level of nasopharyngeal virus shedding during the acute phase of SARS (<2 weeks of illness) can be monitored as an index for therapeutic and clinical progress, and (2) identification of genes associated with virus load can potentially provide leads to pathways involved in virus clearance during the early phase of infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to probe into the factors influencing the SARS-CoV load.",

However, the internal validity of results based on a small sample size in an epidemic setting was further substantiated by the results of permutation tests. On the basis of a preset level of statistical significance, 4 SNPs were singled out for further analysis and discussion. An additional 10 SNPs of 6 genes, which showed differences of >10% in the allele frequency between patients with or without detectable SARS-CoV but for which the differences did not reach the level considered to be significant (figure 3), were also highlighted and should be investigated if the opportunity arises. These candidate genes were selected on the basis of the biological plausibility of innate immune responses to viral infections in a broad sense, rather than specific to SARS-CoV; thus, similar considerations may be pertinent and applicable to a potential influenza pandemic in which no individuals have preexisting immunity and in which the effects of the innate immunity of the hosts would be most conspicuous.",

RelB belongs to the Rel proteins that are evolutionarily conserved mediators of immune responses and are especially important to cytokine expression and the differentiation and survival of cells in the immune system [30]; RelB mutant mice display a severe and fatal multiorgan inflammation. The induction of NF\u03baB, to which RelB is a subunit, is reduced in T lymphocytes from old mice [31] and is a potential mechanism to explain the senescence of immunity.

Estrogen has been shown to reduce IL18 mRNA levels in the mouse uterus [35], suggesting that regulation of IL18 expression could be sex dependent. The outcomes of infection or the level of response to vaccination has been noted to demonstrate sex differences (see Beagley et al. [36] and Morales-Montor et al. [37] for reviews); the innate and adaptive immunity may be regulated through sex hormones [38].
