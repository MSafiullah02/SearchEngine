This event was soon reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). In a month (26 January), the causal microorganism had been identified as a novel coronavirus that was named COVID-19. Genome sequencing and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions tests of this virus had been done. WHO R&D had been started to quicken diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development and a candidate vaccine was prepared for initial laboratory testing .",

These viruses were first studied by Tyrell and Bynoe in 1966 who cultured them from patients with common cold. Due to their spherical virions morphology along with a shell and surface projections like a solar corona, these viruses were named coronaviruses. In Latin corona means crown and there are four different subfamilies including alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses identified so far. Alpha and beta-coronaviruses have been originated from mammalians, particularly from bats, gamma-and delta-coronaviruses originated from pigs and birds (Ather et al., 2020) . The genome of these viruses differs between 26 kb and 32 kb. The beta-coronaviruses could cause severe disease and fatalities among the other seven subtypes of these viruses. Alpha-coronaviruses cause mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic infections. SARSCoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus and is related to the SARS-CoV virus. There are four structural genes encoding the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), a small membrane protein (SM) and the membrane glycoprotein (M) with an extra membrane glycoprotein (HE) occurring in the HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 betacoronaviruses. The whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical to that of a bat coronavirus Cao et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 seemingly had made its transition from animals on an animal market in Wuhan city in China. Although, the efforts to identify potential intermediate hosts seem to have been neglected in Wuhan and the exact transmission route have to be clarified. The primary clinical symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-linked disease COVID-19 which permitted the case detection as pneumonia. Recently literatures report the description of gastrointestinal symptoms and asymptomatic infections, especially among young children. The average incubation period is ranging from 0 to 24 days Zhou et al., 2020) . As we are writing these lines, the pandemic affects 200 countries and territories, with around 1,357,382 infected subjects, more than 120, 438 deaths and 456.773 recovered patients, according to the Johns Hopkins University.",

            "text": "As WHO has declared the fast spreading of COVID-19 as an epidemic, the citizens around the globe hastened to go home. For instance, in the case of Wuhan city in China which has been the epicenter of the pandemic with over than 11 million people, is shown to have produced 200 tons of clinical trash on a single day exactly 24 February/2020 which is four times the amount the city's only dedicated facility can incinerate per day. As coronavirus is spreading rapidly to other parts of the world, very soon the medical waste management could be a big issue. Medical health organizations waste management companies have already taken step in coronavirus decontamination services, it is becoming very crucial for governments to find solutions soon. At the meantime, it is every individual's duty to follow the regulations while discarding of their face masks and other medical wastes (Luan and Ching, 2020) . To the end, it is possible only by mutual understanding and willingness and world will emerge stronger than this epidemic. Some people are at higher risk of adverse effects from contact to medical wastes as well, including cleaners, trash collectors and some other people who have to spend a great amount of time in public places. All over the world governments stopped students to go to schools and universities, and a lot of employees are being asked to work from home, only those who are maintaining the cleanliness of cities have to go to their jobs daily, that makes them among the most vulnerable groups and one that is highly susceptible to the virus from respiratory shed droplets on the masks. They may also be infected by other pathogens existing in the discarded pieces of garbage, for instance meningitis and Hepatitis B. The masks are made up of plastic based materials that are liquid-resistant and are long lasting after they are discarded, ending up in ocean or landfill. The surgical masks should not be worn longer than one day, discarding them and empty bottles of hand sanitizer along with solid tissue papers are ending up to a huge trail of medical waste in the environment. For instance, in Hong Kong, where COVID-19 infection started in late January/2020 the medical wastes have already polluted the environment. Recently, an environmental NGO Ocean Asia in Soko islands took a survey, according to it, in Hong Kong a large amount of discarded single-use masks washed up to a 100-meter stretch of beach. Gary Stokes the director of the Ocean Asia NGO, who has been monitoring the ocean surface trash, his team has seen a few masks over the years, but now they were spotted all along the high tide line and seashore with new deposits coming with each current. While this recent COVID-19 outbreak, the general public have started wearing surgical masks in order to take precautionary measures. When 7 million people suddenly start wearing one or a couple of masks daily, single use gloves and hand sanitizers, the amount of trash created is going to be substantial. The contrary impacts of such medical wastes are far-reaching. When these are remained discarded in an animal's natural habitat in both land and ocean this could cause animals to mistakenly eat this as food and lead in their death (Hellewell et al., 2020) . The diagram below illustrates the problems of polluting the environment by medical wastes while COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 1 ).",

To understand the consequences, and to predict how this pandemic affects differently with various socioeconomic groups is not easy and good data is the key to it. These socioeconomic factors include population density, urban and rural settings, education level, lifestyle, the size of household and homeowners & tenants. Sometimes only a single block distance neighborhood household within the socioeconomic spectrum can make a huge difference in one's life (demonstrate form the US in Club Vita's US longevity map). Therefore, sometimes it is very unfortunate that people who are feeling the effects of COVID-19 very severely, are probably in your neighbors (Messner, 2020) . Majority of the countries are now trying different tactics to stop the spreading of the disease and trying to limit only a subset of the people would catch the disease. It has been indicated that groups with lower socioeconomic status could be more at danger from the spread of the COVID-19, based on the analysis of New York showing that poor neighborhoods have been affected highly. COVID-19 spreads by droplets shed of the respiratory system by someone with the virus, which means it would spread with higher proximity of people, larger contact networks and lower levels of hygiene. There are some factors, which increase the risk of catching the virus.",

This would particularly common in countries like US where the huge number of uninsured population is concentrated in certain industries not to universal health care system. Therefore, some socioeconomic groups are more likely at risk compared to others. So, logically higher numbers of deaths can be expected from certain parts of society.

China is struggling to rebound from the epidemic and has to limit the re-entry of COVID-19 to its region by put a check on travelers coming from abroad (Bogoch et al., 2020) . In a country with such a high population, where the majority of its population has not yet experienced COVID-19, and has no immunological contact with this virus, the possibility of second wave is a big risk. European and North American countries has not yet reached to the peak of the epidemiological curve. One crucial aspect seems obvious: the fast control of the outbreak done by China could not be implemented to democratic countries where rights of individuals are very high. Therefore, outside china no leader has the capability to enforce these measures at the level of China (Bai et al., 2020) . The question is: what will happen in countries of Indian sub-continent, the Middle-East and South America, where they live in crowded forms traditionally, big gatherings are common, and the public health systems are insufficient. The possibility of secondary peak appearance could not be estimated. In the mid-term, the scenario in the southern Hemisphere should be considered. Not almost all South American and African countries have access to national health systems and sufficient health care services. Many of these nations decided to close the borders, however very late, when they already had patients of COVID-19 inside. All these indications show that the Southern Hemisphere would not escape from this pandemic. The outbreak is widening in the southern Hemisphere now, and this is happening while the higher income nations are struggling over their own problems in (i) applying control actions (ii) trying to recuperate from the massive social and economic impacts, and (iii) focusing in preventing re-entry of COVID-19 by foreign travelers (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . The long-term scenario of probable secondary waves of outbreak is concerning as well. A second wave might be devastating more than the first one, based on other pandemics in history. Economists have shown serious concerns about the economic effects of control measures taken during this crisis (Hemida and Abduallah, 2020) . However, there are many models that show the economic impacts of the disease and majority of the economists are challenged by the social and economic depth of the pandemic. They are trying to understand the control as soon as possible. Although the economic losses are obvious, but still economists are not able to grasped the extending nature of the outbreak that is causing far more economic damage compared to drastic measures taken to end the pandemic globally as soon as possible (Meo et al., 2020; Anderson et al., 2020 . The COVID-19 pandemic will have severe impact on socioeconomic growth across the globe as shown in Table. 2.",

A guideline has been already published for the medical employees, health care providers, and public health individuals and researchers who are interested in working in the coronavirus (Mossa-Basha et al., 2020) . The major death cases of coronavirus outbreak are happening mainly in old people probably because of a poor immune system that allows rapid growth of viral infections. The public services must provide in decontaminating reagents for sanitizing hands multiple times on a daily basis (Luan and Ching, 2020) . Physical contact with contaminated and wet things must be counted in dealing with the coronavirus, particularly agents which could be a possible rout of transmission. China and some other countries such as the US applied travel screening that could control and prevent the spread of the virus. Epidemiological alterations in coronavirus infections must be observed. The probable routes of transmission and subclinical infections, adaptation, progression must be taken into consideration and spreading of virus among people and potential intermediate animals and reservoirs should perceived. Moreover, still there are significant numbers of questions that need to ponder. These are, but not limited to, details about how many people have been tested, how many of them turned positive and whether this range stays constant or fluctuating. Additionally, only fewer pediatric cases have been reported to date; that could be due to lack of testing and not due to true infection (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020) .",

And the rest of people who are not infected, their entire life has been changed by this virus. In Italy, the most massive travel restrictions are being placed since Second World War. In London, the normal busy bars, theatres, and other public places have been closed and people are asked to stay in their homes. The flights are being canceled in all over the world. Majority of people are staying at home, practicing social distancing and working remotely (Harapan et al., 2020) . It is all happening to control the spread of coronavirus, and to decrease the death rate. However, all these changes have led some unexpected consequences. As industries, transportation systems and all other bossiness have shut down; it has caused a sudden drop in carbon emission. Compared to this time last year, levels of air pollution in New York have dropped at almost 50% due to measures that have been to restrict the spread of virus. In China, emissions data shows a 25% decrease at the starting point of the year as people were told to stay at home, factories closed and coal use feel by 40% at china's largest power plants since the last three months of 2019. According to the ministry of Ecology and Environment, the amount of good quality air was around 11.4% compared with the same time last year in more than 330 cities all over China. In Europe, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emission dropped over northern Italy, Spain and UK, as shown in satellite images (Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020) .",

As millions of people are holding on lockdown across the globe, energy consumption profiles in buildings are being disturbed. As many people working from home nowadays, domestic energy consumption is predicted to rise very quickly. The predictions data showed that this has risen around 6 to 8% in the US. This pandemic would ultimately save energy and also might have an effect on reducing the consumption of polluting fuels in power stations as the demand has been dropped (Lau et al., 2020) .

However, many think that there is a good side; that the spread of virus has been decreasing air and water pollution and probably even saved lives in this process. Nevertheless, this epidemic which is taking people's lives certainly should not be seen as a way of bringing about positive environmental change. First of all, it is not certain for how long this dip in emission will be. When the epidemic finally subside, then carbon and other pollutant emissions get back then it would be as if this clear sky view never happened and the changes we see today will not have lasting impact. General actions to reduce person to person transmission of COVID-19 are required to control the current outbreak.
