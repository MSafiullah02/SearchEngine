Experimental operations involving baboons as donors have included the xenotransplantation of kidneys into human recipients (Starzl et al., 1964) , transplantation of a baboon auxiliary heart into a human subject (Barnard et al., 1977) , extracorporeal liver perfusion in human subjects with acute fulminating liver failure (Bosman et al., 1968; Hume et al., 1969; Fortner, et al., 1971) , orthotopic heart xenotransplantation in a newborn baby (Bailey et al., 1985) , orthotopic liver transplantation into human subjects (Starzl et al., 1993) , and baboon bone marrow transplantation into a human subject suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Exner et al., 1997) . While recipient survival was limited in each of these pilot experiments (excepting the bone marrow transplant), a great many scientific and philosophical lessons were learned from each one. Importantly, no public health crisis evolved from any of these experiments.",

While hyperacute rejection relates largely to pre-existing antibody and the triggering of intravascular coagulation, delayed acute rejection is produced, in part, by a profound, and as yet, poorly characterized innate cellular immune response that is both antibody-dependent and independent.

And, because they are readily available and because their immune response and adaptation to immunoregulation and antimicrobial therapy mimics that observed in humans, baboons have become a highly desirable model for the study of solid organ xenotransplantation. Baboons have been used as hosts for orthotopic and heterotopic heart, lung, liver, and kidney xenotransplantation. The vast majority of recent investigations involve baboon recipient survival and the characterization and manipulation of the primate immune response to organ transplants derived from commercially produced transgenic pigs. Thus far, baboon host and pig graft survivals have been measured in days or weeks. Most recent graft survival in a modified pig-toprimate model is about 60 days.

Invasive devices, therefore, are completely withdrawn as the animal emerges from anesthesia. Orthotopic heart transplantation, for example, is accomplished with excellent operative outcomes using this less restrictive approach. Other specific surgical research protocols may require more contained or invasive perioperative management. Most animals will not require post-operative intravenous fluids and intense monitoring to assure their operative survival. Close observation is important, however, particularly for assessment of the animal's discomfort. Pain is controlled using regular injections of a narcotic during the initial 12-24 h, and, on occasion, thereafter depending upon an individual animal's needs. Baboons are quite intuitive about the timing of postoperative oral intake of water and food, hence both may be made available to them during the early perioperative period. Baboons are usually capable of being returned to maintenance quarters within 24 h of an operation, where treats such as favorite fruits are provided.",

With further genetic and immunochemical modification of both donors and recipients, the survival of widely divergent porcine xenografts within the primate host environment should increase, and eventually become clinically relevant. This process will require extensive characterization of the recipient immune response, and will involve prolonged labor-intensive effort before the immunological mysteries are decoded. Simultaneously, the challenges of documenting the level of infectious disease risks associated with xenotransplantation, irrespective of the donor species, must be evaluated.",

Using immunoregulatory strategies readily adaptable to a clinical protocol for additional baboon-to-human infant xenotransplants, laboratory host survival has consistently exceeded a year, and in some cases has extended beyond 2 years. Growth of both the baboon hosts and their xenografts has been documented (Matsumiya et al., 1996b) . Despite the complexities of a chronic immunosuppression and surveillance protocol in the baboon model, the animals have experienced a vigorous existence while entirely dependent upon their xenohearts. Death from xenograft rejection has been uncommon. Prevention and/or treatment of disseminated cytomegalovirus, however, has been problematic and cytomegalovirus infection led directly or indirectly to a number of the late deaths.",

Clearly, if the discussion about the risk to public health is not laced with reason and solid, clinically applicable science, then the xenotransplant enterprise will not go forward, and will not succeed. Guidelines and safeguards for this type of research should be established, and investigators should thoroughly examine the potential for infectious disease transfer from animal donor to human recipient and beyond. Progress in xenotransplantation and future clinical trials cannot be aborted on the basis of a general fear of potential risk to public health.
