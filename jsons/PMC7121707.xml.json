            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis\nand pneumonia, affect over 100 million individuals in the United States each year and are a leading cause of health-care encounters, particularly in the late fall and winter [1]. Bronchitis results from infection of the bronchial mucosa. It has been estimated that over 60% of cases are caused by viruses, of which the most common are influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and human metapneumovirus [2, 3]. In comparison to bronchitis, pneumonia affects the more distal portions of the lung including the alveoli. Although it is widely accepted that the majority of pneumonia cases are caused by bacteria, recent evidence suggests that respiratory viruses are also common, either as the single cause or as a coinfecting pathogen [4\u20136]. Common viral pathogens in adults include influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus [4\u20137]. These pathogens are also common causes of pediatric pneumonia, as is RSV [7, 8].",

Despite the significant contributions of these models, inconsistencies among published reports call into question the impact of variable model approaches and how they affect outcome measures. Moreover, the lack of published methodologic details makes it impossible to address the impact of variability among murine models of viral infection [9, 12\u201314]. Here we provide detailed methodologic procedures for generation of RSV and influenza A virus working stock, and efficient viral plaque purification. Moreover, we provide methods for inducing RSV and H1N1 influenza A infection in adult mice and quantification of viral lung titers. Alternative approaches to the described methods are included where available.",

Prepare tenfold serial dilutions (1:1\u20131:1,000,000) using 1\u00d7 Hep-2 media; be sure to vortex between each dilution. Vortex again before adding 100 \u03bcL to each well of a 6-well plate in duplicate.10.Rock the plates on a plate rocker, at 37 \u00b0C at a fast speed for 1 h; rock the plates by hand in the opposite direction of the plate rocker every 20 min during the 1 h incubation to ensure even distribution of virus.11.After the 1 h incubation, mix 1% agarose and 2\u00d7 Hep-2 media (warmed to 37 \u00b0C) immediately before adding 2 mL to each well; add to the sides of the wells overlaying the inoculum that is already in the wells (see\nNote\n11).12.Place the 6-well plates in a 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2\u20136 days until syncytia are visible; monitor closely (see\nNote\n12).\nDay 4\u20136: Picking Plaques13.When virus is ready, pick at least five well-isolated plaques. Circle the plaques under an inverted microscope (4\u00d7 objective works best) (see\nNote\n13).14.Remove plaque and agarose plug using a 1 mL or 2 mL pipette without sliding the pipette tip across plate. After removing the plaque, check the plate under the microscope to ensure plaque was successfully removed.15.Place plaques in individual cryotubes filled with 0.5 mL of 1\u00d7 Hep-2 media; pipette up and down several times to break up the agarose. Reserve a well-isolated plaque for the next round of plaque purification and freeze the rest at \u221280 \u00b0C.16.Initiate the next round of plaque purification with the well-isolated plaque from step 15, making tenfold serial dilutions as described in step 9. Add 100 \u03bcL of each dilution to each well of 6-well plate in duplicate (cells should be 80% confluent). Overlay with agarose as described above.17.Perform four rounds of plaque purification by repeating the steps above.18.To generate master stock when the fourth round of plaques are picked, place the plaques in 0.5 mL of 1\u00d7 Hep-2 media. Be sure to break up the agarose by pipetting up and down, and use the entire solution to infect an 80% confluent T-162 flask of Hep-2 cells.

Be sure to keep the virus suspension cold at all times.10.Centrifuge at 800 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.11.Pool the contents of the four tubes into a sterile glass flask on ice; mix by swirling.12.Aliquot 1.0 mL into each precooled (on ice) glass dram vial. To one of the glass dram vials, add only 500 \u03bcL to be used later for viral titers.13.Tighten each vial carefully and seal with electrical tape before placing in the dry ice/alcohol bath for approximately 5 min. Store vials at \u221280 \u00b0C and quick thaw when ready to use.14.Follow the RSV hematoxylin/eosin plaque assay protocol (Subheading 3.3) to titer viral stocks. Prepare eight dilution tubes (450 \u03bcL each) and two 12-well plates with 1 \u00d7 105 Hep-2 cells per ml per well. Quick thaw the 500 \u03bcL vial of viral stock and inoculate 50 \u03bcL/well using dilutions ranging from 10\u22122 to 10\u22128, leaving the last row of wells for control. After 5 days, fix, stain, and count plaques. Calculate the virus titer using the dilution having at least five plaques per well (Subheading 3.3).15.As an infection control, live virus is placed in a petri dish approximately 4 in. from a 40-W UV light on ice for 4 h. To ensure inactivation, UV-inactivated virus should be titrated on Hep-2 cells as described in Subheading 3.3 (see\nNote\n15).\n\n",

If yours does not have one, gently rotate the eggs several times each day.Incubate the eggs for 7\u20138 days.Candle the eggs to ensure that they are fertilized. Egg candlers can be purchased from poultry supply vendors or can be homemade (see\nNote\n17) and consist of a bright light that is held against the egg for transillumination. Clean the candler with 70% ethanol to avoid contaminating the eggs. Remove the eggs from the incubator and place them in an empty egg carton. Turn off the lights; the room must be very dark. Hold the egg\nby the larger end and place it against the candle to transilluminate the contents. Fertilized eggs will have a thin network of blood vessels that lead to a pea-sized embryo. Unfertilized eggs will not have blood vessels, and a yolk will be readily apparent. Return the eggs to the incubator. Do not leave the eggs outside the incubator for more than 20 min.Continue to incubate the eggs until Day 10 or 11.Prepare virus for inoculation. Remove the virus from the freezer and thaw on ice. If the virus warms or sits for an extended period of time, it will degrade. Working in a BSL-2 biosafety hood, dilute virus stock to 103\u2013104 PFU/mL in sterile DPBS.

The air sac will be on the fat end of the egg and is readily identifiable as a translucent area when you are candling the egg.Put the eggs in a container with the air sac up and place the container in a BSL-2 biosafety hood.Clean the egg shell above the airspace with 70% ethanol.Punch a small hole in the shell of each egg over the air sac. This can be achieved using a sterile 18-gauge needle. Some investigators prefer to use a high-speed rotary drill (such as a Dremel).

Virus should be rapidly thawed immediately prior to use and stored on ice throughout the infection period.Use the appropriate number of mice (8\u201310 weeks of age) per experimental and control groups (see\nNotes\n18 and 19) for each experiment. BALB/c mice should be used for RSV infections. Any strain may be used for influenza A infection.Prior to viral inoculation, weigh all mice to accurately determine inoculum required.Lightly anesthetize the mice with 2% isoflurane in an induction chamber equipped with a charcoal filter. To avoid over- or under-sedation, it is recommended that no more than four mice be placed in the induction chamber at one time. Initially the mice will demonstrate rapid breathing. They are ready to inoculate when they establish a slowed, rhythmic breathing pattern (~6 min) (see\nNote\n20).Remove one mouse from the induction chamber at a time by grabbing the nape of the neck. Hold the mouse vertically, then slightly tip it back to a 20-degree angle, and deliver the calculated dose\nintranasally using a standard 100\u2013200 \u03bcL pipette. Keep the mouse at the 20-degree angle until the entire inoculum is inhaled, and then return it to the cage.

Though some studies have shown that heat inactivation does not impact in vitro studies with cultured lymphocytes [16]. Data published by Smith and colleagues [17] suggests that complement activation promotes the lysis of RSV -infected Hep-2 cells. Thus, heat inactivation of serum is recommended for growing RSV in Hep-2 cells.Only add l-glutamine if it is not included in the base MEM media.Vials must remain in the dry ice bath for no less than 5 min. A peak formed in the center and yellow color will indicate successful snap freezing of each vial. When vials are thawed, the color of the medium should be pink. If the medium is yellow after thawing, this usually indicates that ethanol contaminated the contents of the vial and that the vial should not be used for infection as the virus will not infect cells or mice.With the surge of genetically modified mice on a C57BL/6 background, many investigators now are establishing RSV infection models using C57BL/6 mice. The key difference between the two mouse strains relevant to RSV host immunity is that BALB/c mice express a predominantly Th2 phenotype whereas C57BL/6 mice have a more balanced Th1/Th2 response.In the adult mouse model of RSV infection, weight loss is used as a measure of illness. A bimodal weight loss pattern is typically observed at 2 and 6 days postinfection [18].The use of early passage Hep-2 cells improves viral growth and produces higher viral titers.If aggressive rocking of the trypsin over the cells does not elicit cell detachment within 1\u20132 min, placing at 37 \u00b0C may promote trypsin-mediated removal of adherent cells.When the T-162 flask is at 80% confluence, cell counts are typically performed at a 1:10 dilution.Hep-2 cells adhere to the plate quickly; thus, the shaking step must be done immediately after plating.When preparing agarose, start by microwaving 1% agarose until completely melted (may boil), let cool on bench slightly, and then maintain at 55\u201360 \u00b0C in a water bath or dry oven. Make sure agarose has cooled enough so as not to kill the virus during the overlay as RSV is very temperature sensitive. If the agarose cools too much before addition to the plate, the agarose will solidify too early.Agarose will solidify while in the incubator. When grown in agarose, syncytia look more rounded and clumpy, with little to no fusions compared to growing in a flask with medium alone.To ensure optimal plaque isolation, circle and pick plaques from plates with less than 50 plaques.To prepare for the viral harvest, print labels with ink that won\u2019t smudge in alcohol with date and place on glass dram vials. Precool supplies in refrigerator over the weekend (e.g., vials, sterile glass flasks, 10 mL pipettes, six 50 mL centrifuge tubes).Various RSV infection controls have been reported in the literature, including the use of cell lysate [13], vehicle [19], PBS [20], or UV-inactivated virus [21]. In our hands, the use of cell lysate elicits early, subtle increases in macrophage MHC class II expression, whereas MEM (vehicle) does not. Depending on the question being asked in your model, UV-inactivated virus may serve as a more suitable control to determine disease pathology associated with live, replicating virus.This step is critical for even distribution of the cells. If the cells are not distributed evenly throughout the well, areas of cell accumulation and overgrowth will occur. Hep-2 cells tend to accumulate in the center of the wells creating a characteristic \u201cdonut-hole\u201d appearance and making viral purification and titers impossible (Fig. 3).A candler can be constructed from a small LED flashlight (lamp size approximately 1.5 in. diameter), a small medicine cup, and electrical tape. Using a sharp blade, cut the bottom off the base of the medicine cup. Place the base of the cup over the lamp of the flashlight and cover it completely with electrical tape. The open end of the medicine cup should fit snugly over the end of the egg. Light should pass freely from the flashlight through the medicine cup and transilluminate the egg. If a medicine cup is not available, cardboard may be used but this is less sturdy and more difficult to keep clean.BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice are both commonly used in mouse models of RSV infection. BALB/c mice display a more Th2-type cytokine response compared to C57BL/6 mice warranting their use in RSV-based studies. However, C57BL/6 mice have a wider variety of genetically modified mice, enabling more mechanistic-based questions.Pilot experiments using at least five mice per group should be performed to determine the effect size of a particular intervention, allowing for a power analysis to be performed to determine the appropriate number of mice per group for future experiments.Anesthesia: In order to deliver 2% isoflurane/oxygen, a vaporizer and induction chamber are required. Isoflurane induces a light level of sedation to overcome the animals\u2019 resistance to inhaling the inoculum and allows for a rapid recovery time. Alternatively, ketamine (50 mg/kg)/xylazine (9 mg/kg) delivered intramuscularly provides a deeper level of sedation than isoflurane and is good option if you do not have an induction chamber and vaporizer.In adult mice (6\u201312 weeks of age), a variety of RSV viral strains, inoculum size, volumes, and routes of delivery are reported.Viral strain: The RSV A2, available through American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), is a commonly used viral strain for established murine models of RSV infection. The A2 strain has been used extensively in murine studies to model the immune response to infection, disease pathogenesis, and to establish critical vaccine parameters. Alternatively, RSV Line 19, originally isolated from an infant at the University of Michigan Hospital [22], has been used to establish murine models of severe RSV disease with significant mucus production and development of airway hyperresponsiveness [23]. Unlike RSV A2 or Long strains, RSV Line 19 elicits extensive IL-13 and mucin production, which are critical in assessing the role of RSV in allergic asthma [24].Viral inoculum: Reported viral inoculums range from 1 \u00d7 105 PFU to 1.5 \u00d7 107 PFU. The size of the viral inoculum will depend on the desired model. Despite reduced viral replication of RSV Line 19 compared to A2 in vivo, a dose-dependent increase in Gob5 and Muc5A expression along with increased IL-13 has been reported, suggesting the use of lower Line 19 inoculums in models designed to understand the role of RSV in allergic asthma [23]. Alternatively, higher doses may be warranted in models designed to assess disease pathology during acute primary infection.Route: Inhaled and intratracheal viral inoculums are the most common forms of delivery reported. Inhaled viral delivery is easy and quick and achieves viral inoculation in the nose and airway [9]. Intratracheal delivery may be used to deliver virus to the lower airway [25].Volume: The viral inoculum is most frequently delivered in 100 \u03bcL based on work published by Graham et al. [9] demonstrating more efficient delivery of 99m technetium sulfur colloid to the lungs upon inhalation of higher volumes of the inoculum.\nThe pathogenicity and lethality of H1N1 influenza A vary between mouse strains and may also vary with the sex of the animals. A dose of 50 PFU per mouse is a good starting dose; however, before proceeding with a full experiment, a pilot experiment should be performed to determine the optimal dose. Several doses, varied by two- to tenfold, may be tried. For studies of acute inflammation and lung injury, we chose a dose that induces a 10\u201315% drop in body weight. Weight loss is generally greatest 7 days postinfection. Weight loss greater than 20% is commonly premorbid.\n\n",
