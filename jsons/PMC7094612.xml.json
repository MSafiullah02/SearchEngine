The majority of these patients seek medical attention, and this accounts for > 10 million office visits per year.9, 10, 11 Acute bronchitis leads to 10 ambulatory visits per 1,000 people per year.12 The major reason for seeking care is for symptom relief, and one survey10 of adults showed that 66% of those who sought care did so in the first week of illness, and that 88% did so within 2 weeks. When asked, most individuals label an acute illness that causes cough and sputum production as a \u201cchest cold\u201d; considerably fewer suggest the diagnosis of \u201cbronchitis.\u201d Because colds, upper respiratory infections, and bronchitis have been targeted as conditions that are associated with excessive antibiotic prescription use in the general medical community, and much of this problem is fueled by public expectation, the descriptive term used with patients may be very important. When asked, a greater proportion of patients thought that therapy with antibiotics was important for recovery from acute bronchitis (44%) compared with chest colds (11%).10\n",

Influenza occurs in distinct outbreaks each year, and because of its rapid spread it causes considerable morbidity in the general population. The most frequently reported symptoms of influenza are weakness (94%), myalgia (94%), cough (93%), and nasal congestion (91%). Individuals with influenza are more likely than those with influenza-like illness to have baseline cough (93% vs 80%, respectively), fever (68% vs 40%, respectively), and cough and fever together (64% vs 33%, respectively).15 When influenza is circulating within the community, the presence of both cough and fever within 48 h of symptom onset is a strong predictor of influenza infection. RSV has also been recognized as a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in adults, especially in the elderly. Attack rates are very high in households with small children,16 and in geriatric wards, senior day care settings, and nursing homes.17, 18 In one outbreak, the clinical and serologic attack rates were 61.2% and 75%, respectively, with intense coughing reported by 96%.17 In surveillance studies of influenza-like illnesses in adults in general practice, RSV has been identified as the causative agent in 20% of patients compared to 30% for influenza.19\n",

The infection was first seen in humans in China in November 2002 but has spread worldwide. Exposed health-care workers are at high risk of infection; in the Toronto outbreak, 77% of the patients were exposed to SARS in the hospital setting.20 Nonproductive cough was seen in 69% of patients, with documented fever in 85%, myalgias in 49%, and dyspnea in 42%; only 2% had rhinorrhea. In a report from Taiwan,21 74% of patients developed cough at a mean (\u00b1 SD) time of 4.5 \u00b1 1.9 days after the onset of fever. Fifty-nine percent of these patients had an infiltrate that was consistent with pneumonia seen on the chest radiograph on admission to the hospital.

The bacteria that have been causally linked to acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy individuals include only Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and Bordetella parapertussis.1 Prospective surveys22 of healthy adults and adolescents with a cough lasting \u2265 5 days have shown that M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae are rare causes (< 1%). Greater incidences have been described in community outbreaks of acute illnesses, and outbreaks among military personnel and on college campuses.23, 24, 25 In these settings, as many as 36% of patients showed evidence of mixed infections with viruses and M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, or B pertussis.25 While the importance of other bacterial pathogens in the pathogenesis of acute uncomplicated bronchitis has been suggested,26 there are few data to support this. In patients with chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae play a role during an acute exacerbation of cough and sputum production.27 However, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is a different disease than acute bronchitis. Because these three organisms may inhabit the upper airways of healthy adults, their presence in sputum cultures in patients with acute uncomplicated bronchitis may signify colonization and not acute infection.28 The concept that acute bacterial bronchitis in healthy adults may be caused by these organisms remains unproven.",

In some patients, particularly in those with recurrent attacks of presumed uncomplicated acute bronchitis, asthma, and not acute bronchitis, may be the cause of the recurrent symptoms and abnormal airway reactivity.35 In other patients, the symptoms of acute bronchitis may persist for > 3 weeks, and a diagnosis of asthma becomes apparent.

Because pneumonia is not usually a self-limited disease and has considerable morbidity and mortality when not adequately treated, the distinction between these two respiratory infections is particularly important. This is especially pertinent in the elderly population, in which a high index of suspicion is necessary because pneumonia in persons in this age group is associated with a lower prevalence of respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms at the time of presentation.38 Four prospective studies39, 40, 41, 42 in younger and older adults have evaluated the patient medical history and physical examination for accurately diagnosing radiographically confirmed pneumonia. These studies and an evidence-based and quality-based review43 have concluded that the absence of the following findings reduces the likelihood of pneumonia sufficiently to obviate the need for a chest radiograph: (1) heart rate > 100 beats/min; (2) respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min; (3) an oral body temperature of > 38\u00b0C; and (4) chest examination findings of focal consolidation, egophony, or fremitus. Purulent sputum was not an accurate distinction between pneumonia and acute bronchitis; moreover, there were no serum markers that could be used with sufficient accuracy for a presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia.",

Because they can be effective in patients with chronic bronchitis, it is reasonable to presume that they would be effective for patients with acute bronchitis. Studies on the use of these agents for the cough due to colds or acute viral respiratory illnesses have shown mixed results and are not recommended for routine use62, 63, 64, 65 (see the section on cough suppressant and pharmacologic protussive therapy). Some studies have shown these agents to be successful in reducing subjective cough scores. In one study,63 710 adults with an acute upper respiratory infection and cough were given a single dose of 30 mg of dextromethorphan hydrobromide or placebo, and objective cough assessment was conducted using continuous cough recordings. Cough was significantly reduced during a 4-h observation period. Because the cause of the cough in many of these subjects was likely due to acute bronchitis, it would be reasonable to offer an empiric trial of an antitussive agent for severe coughing during the acute illness.",

Quality of evidence, fair; benefit, conflicting; grade of recommendation, I\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n1.\nIn a patient with an acute respiratory infection manifested predominantly by cough, with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks, a diagnosis of acute bronchitis should not be made unless there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Quality of evidence, expert opinion; benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, E/A2.\nIn patients with the presumed diagnosis of acute bronchitis, viral cultures, serologic assays, and sputum analyses should not be routinely performed because the responsible organism is rarely identified in clinical practice. Quality of evidence, low; benefit, intermediate; grade of recommendation, C3.\nIn patients with acute cough and sputum production suggestive of acute bronchitis, the absence of the following findings reduces the likelihood of pneumonia sufficiently to eliminate the need for a chest radiograph: (1) heart rate > 100 beats/min; (2) respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min; (3) oral body temperature of > 38\u00b0C; and (4) chest examination findings of focal consolidation, egophony, or fremitus. Quality of evidence, low; benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, B4a.\nFor patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Quality of evidence, good; benefit, none; grade of recommendation, D4b.\nFor these patients, the decision not to use an antibiotic should be addressed individually and explanations should be offered because many patients expect to receive an antibiotic based on previous experiences and public expectation. Quality of evidence, expert opinion; benefit, intermediate; grade of recommendation, E/B5.\nChildren and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of evidence, A6a.\nIn most patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, \u03b2\n2\n-agonist bronchodilators should not be routinely used to alleviate cough. Quality of evidence, fair; benefit, none; grade of recommendation, D6b.\nIn select adult patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis and wheezing accompanying the cough, treatment with \u03b2\n2\n-agonist bronchodilators may be useful. Quality of evidence, fair; benefit, small/weak; grade of recommendation, C7.\nIn patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing. Quality of evidence, fair; benefit, small/weak; grade of recommendation, C8.\nIn patients with a diagnosis of acutebronchitis, because there is no consistent favorable effect of mucokinetic agents on cough, they are not recommended. Quality of evidence, fair; benefit, conflicting; grade of recommendation, I\n\n",
