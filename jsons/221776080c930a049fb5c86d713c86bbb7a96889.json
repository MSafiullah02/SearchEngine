However, initially, as it was a new and relatively unknown virus for which there was lack of screening and testing equipment, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly across the world [2] . Indeed, it spread so rapidly that, by 26 February 2020, the number of new cases of COVID-19 outside of China increased 13-fold compared with those inside China, and the number of countries with cases of COVID-19 had tripled. On 11 March 2020, the WHO categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic [8] . On 27 February 2020, Pakistan reported its first two patients with COVID-19, both of whom had recently returned to Pakistan from Iran [9] . As of 7 March 2020, the global number of confirmed COVID-19 cases surpassed 100,000 (21,110 outside of China, including 4747 in Iran and seven in Pakistan), with 3073 fatalities (413 outside of China, including 121 in Iran) [10] . In Pakistan, all reported cases were because of direct travel from Iran. By 23 March 2020, the number of WHOconfirmed cases more than tripled to 334,981, and the number of deaths increased almost fivefold to 14,652 across 190 countries [9] (Fig. 1) .",

Notwithstanding this, current trade agreements with China and the politicoreligious relationship with Iran has resulted in an influx of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals from these two regional epicenters. To curtail further transmission, as a first-line response, Pakistan closed the border with China and initiated very strict screening at the Pakistani-Iranian border. Additionally, in coordination with the civil aviation authority, the government of Pakistan enforced the screening of passengers before they were allowed to enter the country [12] .",

Lack of awareness was commonplace throughout the country, and mass prayer events continued despite warnings that such public activities would exacerbate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Social media and other sources spread fear, rumors, and false \"facts\". The price of common utilities quickly grew with the severing of international trade in an attempt to hamper the spread of the virus, black-market trade in essential goods, and hoarding of many products. Fear of a national economic downturn in an already troubled economy, coupled with the fear of a decline in jobs and in the ability of the average citizen to earn and provide for their families, further hampered the government's ability to lockdown cities and markets. Ordinary citizens ignored governmental calls and ordinances urging people to stay at home to curtail the transmission of the virus. Inconsistent immigration policies at the borders, improper screening, poor quarantine camps, lack of protective supplies, poorly trained healthcare professionals, and the actions of local gangs contributed to the inability to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan [16] .",
