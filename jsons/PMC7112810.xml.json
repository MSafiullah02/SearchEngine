            "text": "Pentraxins are a superfamily of phylogenetically conserved and multi-functional proteins [1], [2], [3], which exert basic and evolutionarily conserved innate immune functions such as complement activation and opsonization [4]. Based on the primary structure, pentraxins are divided into two subfamilies: short and long pentraxin [1]. C-reactive protein (CRP) [5] and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) [6] are the well-known, prototypic short and long pentraxin, respectively. These two pentraxins share fundamental functions as fluid-phase pattern recognition molecules (PRMs); however, their structure and expression pattern are diverse. Unlike CRP, the sequence and regulation of PTX3 are conserved from mouse to human, this pushing forward the genetic approach to understand the roles of PTX3 in vivo. Therefore genetically modified mice have been essential to reveal the multifunctional properties of PTX3 at the crossroad between innate immunity, inflammation, matrix deposition and female fertility [1], [4]. Here, we will compare the main characteristics of CRP and PTX3 as prototypes of the short and long pentraxin family respectively, and we will then focus on the complex \u201cyin-yang\u201d roles of PTX3 in innate immunity and inflammation.",

CRP and Serum Amyloid P component (SAP) [8] are the prototypes of the short pentraxin subfamily [9], while PTX3 is the first identified long pentraxin [6] characterized by the presence of a long unrelated N-terminal domain associated to the C-terminal pentraxin domain. After PTX3, other members of the long pentraxin subfamily were identified, including guinea pig apexin, neuronal pentraxin 1 (NPTX1) [10], [11], neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2, also called Narp) [12], [13] and the transmembrane protein neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR, reviewed in [1], [4]). In an attempt to find new pentraxin domain-containing proteins we recently identified PTX4 [14], a molecule conserved from mammals to lower vertebrates which clusters alone in phylogenetic analysis. However, PTX4 has a unique pattern of mRNA expression, which is distinct from that of other long pentraxins, and it does not behave as acute phase protein [14].",

            "text": "A brief comparison of the main characteristics of CRP and PTX3 is reported in Table 1\n. Human CRP gene, located in chromosome 1q23.2, consists of two exons: the first one encodes for the signal peptide (aa 1\u201318) and for aa 19\u201320 of the mature protein, the second exon encodes for the remaining amino acids (21\u2013224) of the polypeptide chain [15], [16]. CRP protein assembles into radial symmetric pentamer with planar symmetry (Fig. 1B) [17]. Two cysteine residues (aa 36 and 97 of the mature protein), which are conserved between pentraxins, forms intra-molecule disulfide bonds [18], while non-covalent interactions stabilize the pentamer. Some transcription factor binding sequences (HNF1\u03b1, C/EBP\u03b2/\u03b4, STAT3, p50 and c-Rel) are located in the promoter region of human CRP gene [19], [20]. CRP is produced in the liver in response to cytokine stimulation, mostly contributed by interleukin (IL)-6 and, to less degree, by IL-1\u03b2. CRP is known as major acute phase protein in human: under inflammatory condition, its circulating level increases as much as 1000-fold from the basal value (3 mg/L) [21], [22]. Thus circulating CRP levels reflect the systemic inflammatory responses. SAP has 51% amino acid identity with CRP and a similar pentameric structure (Fig. 1B). The two proteins share many structural and biological characteristics including the capacity to interact in a calcium-dependent fashion with different ligands.",

            "text": "Some transcription factor binding sequences (Pu-1, AP1, NF-\u03baB, SP1 and NF-IL6) are located in the promoter region of human PTX3 [26], [27]. In contrast to the IL-6-mediated CRP production, PTX3 is produced in response to several primary inflammatory signals such as TLR agonists, IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) [1], [28]. In addition, various types of cells express PTX3 upon appropriate stimulation. PTX3-expressing cells include myeloid dendritic cells [29], monocytes/macrophages [30], [31], vascular endothelial cells [6], [32], smooth muscle cells [33], fibroblasts [31], [32], adipocytes [34], glial cells [35], cumulus oophorus cells [36], mesangial cells [37] and synovial cells [38]. An unexpected constitutive expression of PTX3 has been observed in lymphatic endothelial cells [39]. In addition, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) contain a storage of mature protein accumulated in specific granules during their maturation process in the bone marrow [40]. Stored PTX3 is promptly released to the extracellular space upon bacterial stimulation (i.e. E. coli, S. aureus or zymosan), as well as following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin or TNF\u03b1 treatment. Released PTX3 is localized to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and exerts non-redundant role in pathogen resistance [40]. NETs are a mesh-like component consisting of DNA decorated with histones and anti-microbial proteins, which can trap microbes and form an antimicrobial proteins-rich microenvironment [41], [42], [43]. The variety of PTX3-producing cells ensures that PTX3 is produced at local sites where the primary inflammation occurs.",

In vivo, PTX3 plays non-redundant roles in the defense against infections caused by recognized microbes. Ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to infections with Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n[61], murine cytomegalovirus [65] and influenza virus [66]. We reported that PTX3 has therapeutic effects acting as an opsonin, thus facilitating recognition and phagocytosis of microbes in an Fc\u03b3 receptor- and complement-dependent manner [64], [68] (Table 2\n). PTX3 also exerts protective effect to infection-induced organ injury. In a murine model of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by murine hepatitis virus 1 (MHV-1) infection, ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a more severe lung injury compared to wild type mice at early time points (days 1\u20134 after infection) [67]. PTX3 deficiency is associated with a higher early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lung. Indeed recombinant PTX3 administration significantly enhanced viral clearance, reduced lung injury, neutrophils influx in lungs and levels of inflammatory cytokines, thus indicating a protective role of PTX3 in this model of lung injury [67] (Table 2). Analyses of PTX3-overexpressing mice further support the protective role against infection. PTX3-overexpressing mice result to be protected from severe inflammatory reactions such as LPS-induced endotoxemia and cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) [69], which are common experimental sepsis models [70]. However in a model of infection with Klebsiella pneumonia, PTX3-overexpressing mice show different susceptibility depending on the doses of the pathogen. In fact these mice showed faster lethality when receiving higher inocula, and protection when treated with lower amount of bacteria [71]. This reversible response of PTX3-overexpressing mice was accompanied by reduced neutrophil influx and increased TNF\u03b1 level in higher inocula, and enhanced neutrophil influx and no-change of TNF\u03b1 level in lower inocula [71] (Table 2).",

In a murine AMI model caused by coronary artery ligation and reperfusion, an increased myocardial damage associated with a greater no-reflow area, an increased neutrophil infiltration, a decreased number of capillaries, and an increased number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes were observed in ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice [72]. Additionally we observed an increased deposition of the complement component C3 delimiting the injured area, suggesting that modulation of complement activation could contribute to the cardioprotective role of PTX3 (Table 2). In a model of limbic seizure, PTX3 binds to dying cells protecting them from irreversible damage and conferring resistance to neurodegeneration [73]. On the contrary, at early time point (48 h) of ischemic brain injury, no differences were observed in infarct volume, brain edema and blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) damage between ptx3\u2212/\u2212 and wild type mice [74]. However after 6 days of ischemic brain injury, BBB damage was higher and edema resolution did not occur in ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice. Additionally the scar formation was impaired in mice lacking PTX3, with less extracellular matrix production and reduction of microglial proliferation (Table 2). The higher susceptibility of ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice to LPS-induced ALI [75] indicates the defensive role of PTX3. In this model, the lung injury was accompanied by elevated neutrophil infiltration, cell death and fibrin deposition in the lung. PTX3 deficiency also enhanced LPS-induced tissue factor expression/activation in the lung and increased TNF\u03b1 and CCL2 levels in the plasma [75] (Table 2). The higher resistance to endotoxemia by LPS was also observed in PTX3 overexpressing animals [69], which is associated to higher levels of IL-10 and nitric oxide (NO) production by peritoneal macrophages (Table 2).",

A reversible effect was reported in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). Chen and coworkers reported that ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice have a reduced early expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines, and an ameliorated acute kidney injury [76]. On the contrary other reports showed that the post-ischemic renal injury was aggravated in ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice [77], and PTX3 administration was able to prevent renal leukocyte recruitment and post-ischemic kidney injury (Table 2). In an intestinal ischemia and reperfusion model, only negative effects of PTX3 were observed both in PTX3-overexpressing mice [78] and ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice [79]. The impaired survival rate of PTX3-overexpressing animals after ischemia and reperfusion of the superior mesenteric artery correlated with enhanced neutrophil influx and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CCL2, CXCL1) [78]. In agreement, when the same model was applied to ptx3\u2212/\u2212 mice, a decreased neutrophil influx and reduction of lethality was observed accompanied to decreased cytokine production [79] (Table 2). The negative effect of PTX3 also occurred in ventilation-induced lung injury [80]. In this model PTX3 overexpression led the increased mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2, CCL2, CXCL1 and accelerated the development of lung injury (Table 2).",

Neutrophil infiltration can act as a double-edged sword during the inflammatory response, participating in tissue repair and defense but also further promoting tissue damage, as observed in ischemia-reperfusion injury, shock, systemic septicemia and ALI. Searching for a possible mechanism explaining the regulatory role of PTX3 on inflammation, we explored the interaction of this protein with adhesion molecules involved in the initial steps of leukocyte extravasation. Indeed we observed a specific binding of PTX3 to P-selectin but not to L- and E-selectin [81]. We also demonstrated that, through the interaction with P-selectin, PTX3 either derived from activated leukocytes or administered exogenously could attenuate neutrophils recruitment at sites of inflammation in a model of pleurisy or acute lung injury [81] (Table 2). This negative feedback mechanism may globally participate in the protective role of PTX3 in inflammation as well as ALI [81].",

Conversely, PTX3 is distinguished by being an early and local acute phase biomarker, differing from CRP for gene organization, protein oligomerization and expression pattern. In addition a main difference between CRP and PTX3 is represented by the different gene regulation from mouse to human. In vivo experiments on genetically modified animals are helpful to understand the roles of PTX3 in innate immunity and inflammation. Accumulated evidences from in vivo studies indicate that, although the predominant roles of PTX3 were host-protective, detrimental effects were observed in certain experimental settings. This \u201cyin-yang\u201d behavior in host-defense (Fig. 2) likely derives from the multi-functional properties of PTX3. Further investigations are necessary for the clinical use of the protein as diagnostics and therapeutics.",
