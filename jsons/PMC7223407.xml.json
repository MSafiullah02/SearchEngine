MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections are responsible for more than 30% of hospital-acquired infections, with even higher rates in critically ill, cancer and immunosuppressed patients [4, 5]. Resistance to carbapenems, initially considered potent broad-spectrum antibiotics used to treat these infections [6], has increased significantly within the last decade because of the prevalence of carbapenemases among these pathogens [7\u201310]. Moreover, infections caused by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) or pandrug-resistant (PDR) organisms have emerged and spread all over the world [11\u201314]. Under such situations, older drugs like colistin, tigecycline, fosfomycin, clindamycin and cotrimoxazole are being deployed as the last resort in clinical practice for infections caused by MDR bacteria [15, 16].",

Previous studies had indicated that tigecycline was not better than other antimicrobial agents and might be associated with increased mortality [23\u201325]. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic research suggested that this lack of efficacy may be due to its suboptimal concentrations in both serum and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid [26]. Therefore, a regimen of high dose tigecycline (HDT) (200 mg initial dose, followed by 100 mg twice per day) has been used in clinical practice. A systematic review in 2014 attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of HDT for the treatment of severe infections, but it could not draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of HDT because of limited clinical evidence [27]. With the accumulation of new studies, we aimed to reassess the effectiveness and safety of HDT for the treatment of severe infections.",

In our meta-analysis, all the included pathogens for CR-subgroup analysis were MDR K. pneumoniae and MDR A. baumannii, and the antibiotics used were those with high resistant rates in CR-K. pneumoniae and CR-A. baumannii. As tigecycline is a tetracycline-derived bacteriostatic agent, without the synergistic effect of other active bactericides, the clearance of those pathogens would be slow [18]. The combination of these reasons may explain the lack of difference in the microbiological eradication rate between HDT and the control group in the CR-subgroup.",

However, the results in this review showed that the microbiological eradication rate was lower in the SDT group compared with the HDT group. The lower microbiological eradication rate suggests that there were more pathogens exposed to a suboptimal concentration of tigecycline and hence would possibly select for more antimicrobial resistant bacteria. A similar result was also found in a recently published review paper, which illustrated that the microbiological eradication rate was lower in the SDT group compared with other non-tigecycline antibiotics in the treatments of pneumonia caused by MDR A. baumannii [52]. Therefore, the selection of SDT-containing regimens as the clinical choice should be reconsidered because it might increase the probability of emergence of XDR or PDR pathogens.
