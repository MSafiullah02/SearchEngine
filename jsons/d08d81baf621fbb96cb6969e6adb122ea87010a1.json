Symptoms include fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome.

It is also possible that an infected person may not show any of these symptoms. In most of the cases (80%), the infection will be mild and need no special treatment. In severe cases, especially in the elderly and in those with comorbid conditions, the infection can lead to impaired kidney and liver function leading to organ failure and death.

If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. \u2022 Respiratory hygiene: Mouth and nose should be covered while coughing or sneezing with a tissue and throw the tissue into a closed bin followed by hand hygiene. It is also advised to cough into the bend of the elbow. \u2022 A distance of at least 1 m (3 feet) should be maintained between individuals and those having coughing, sneezing, and fever. Crowded places and mass gatherings should be avoided. \u2022 Regular screening for fever should be instituted and employees who have mild respiratory symptoms are advised to stay at home. Any experience of fever, cough, and breathing difficulty especially if the employee has traveled to any of the countries reporting COVID-19 cases or had close contact with a confirmed/suspected case of COVID-19 within 28 days should be reported immediately to the health facility. \u2022 WHO does not recommend the use of facemask by healthy people. Facemasks are recommended for people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the virus to others. Using facemask is crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of a suspected or a confirmed case in close settings (at home or in a health care facility). If a mask is worn, a medical mask is to be used, ensuring that it fits well and that there are no gaps between the mask and the face. Masks should be discarded in a closed bin when it is damp, followed by hand hygiene. Individuals should avoid touching the nose, mouth, and eyes when the mask is on. \u2022 Environmental hygiene should be maintained especially in common areas used by employees like restrooms and canteens. Regular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched objects and surfaces using regular disinfectants is necessary. Windows and doors should be kept open for cross-ventilation. \u2022 In case employees are traveling out on work they should be advised to be cautious and avoid visiting live animal markets, wet markets, or animal product markets. Consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Personal hygiene should be maintained at all times.",

Make sure adequate tissue paper and soap/hand sanitizers are available in the workplace. \u2022 Studies suggest that the COVID-19 virus may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days and, therefore, regular environmental cleaning is recommended with a disinfectant. Make sure the workplace, workstations, and commonly used surfaces like doorknobs, washrooms, keyboards, telephone, remote controls are frequently wiped using disinfectant or cleaning agents. \u2022 Travel advice to employees-specific travel advice should be provided to employees traveling to and from China and countries with active infection. Employees returning from affected countries should stay at home for 14 days irrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms. \u2022 Informational/educational materials about \"Do's and Don'ts\", personal hygiene, and other relevant health messages should be displayed at prominent places.
