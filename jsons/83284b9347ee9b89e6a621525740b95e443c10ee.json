Mortality 59 rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be below 1%, 2 mainly due to the severe acute respiratory 60 syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction. Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 received 61 less medical attention; nevertheless, the first cases of myocarditis in COVID- 19 patients have 62 been reported. [3] [4] [5] [6] Moreover, myocarditis was recognized as the cause of death in some 63 COVID-19 patients. 7 Pathology is usually focal within the myocardium, but there is a risk of 64 arrhythmia, as well as progression to fulminant heart failure and cardiogenic shock. This 65 article outlines the possible pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis, its clinical 66 presentation, as well as the associated arrhythmias. The criteria for screening and 67 management of myocarditis relating to COVID-19 are also proposed. Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart characterized by inflammatory infiltrates 72 and myocardial injury without an ischemic cause. 8 The most commonly identifiable cause of 73 myocarditis in the United States other developed countries is viral. 9 , 10 Esfandiarei and 74",

            "text": "McManus 8 proposed that the pathophysiology of viral myocarditis is a combination of direct 75 cell injury and T-lymphocytes-mediated cytotoxicity which can be augmented by the 76 cytokine storm syndrome. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) appears to be the central mediator of cytokine 77 storm where it orchestrates the pro-inflammatory responses from immune cells including the 78 T-lymphocytes. 11 This causes T-lymphocyte activation and a further release of inflammatory 79 cytokines which stimulate more T-lymphocytes, leading to a positive feedback loop of 80 immune activation and myocardial damage. Cardiotropism of the T-lymphocytes is thought 81 to arise from the interaction between the heart-produced hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and 82 c-Met, a HGF receptor on na\u00efve T-lymphocytes. 12 Despite being a minor cause of all viral myocarditis cases, human coronaviruses have been 86 linked to myocarditis in patients of all age groups. [13] [14] [15] The viral RNAs of MERS-CoV and 87 SARS-CoV, which are close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, were found in the heart tissues of 88 infected animals, suggesting that these coronaviruses possess cardiotropism. 16 Possible pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis 100 SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the human cells by binding its spike protein to a membrane 101 protein, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). 20 However, the spike protein must first 102 be cleaved at the S1/S2 and subsequently at the S2' sites to enable binding to the ACE2. 103",

It is critical to 187 distinguish fulminant myocarditis from sepsis as fluid resuscitation, a common sepsis 188 protocol, exacerbates fulminant myocarditis with fluid overload. We encourage testing the 189 patients for the baseline cardiac enzymes e.g. troponin and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 190 peptide (NT-proBNP) on hospital admissions, as the cardiac troponin I (cTnI), cTnT, NT-191 proBNP and BNP are usually elevated in myocarditis due to the acute myocardial injury and 192 possible ventricular dilatation. Elevations of both troponin and NT-proBNP were observed in 193 the COVID-19-related myocarditis cases. 3-6 Although negative troponin cannot exclude 194 myocarditis, particularly for the atypical forms such as giant cell myocarditis or for those in 195 the chronic phase, negative serial high sensitivity cardiac troponin is still helpful in the acute 196 phase and makes acute myocarditis significantly less likely. In COVID-19 patients, the (NT-197 pro)BNP could also rise secondary to myocardial stress, a possible knock-on effect from 198 severe respiratory illness. 38 199 200 Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities commonly seen with pericarditis such as ST 201 elevation and PR depression may be observed in myocarditis; 9 nevertheless, they are not 202 sensitive to detect the disease and their absence is not exclusionary. For instance, one of the 203 COVID-19-related myocarditis cases showed neither ST elevation nor PR depression. 3 Other 204 ECG abnormalities including a new onset bundle branch block, QT prolongation, 205 pseudoinfarct pattern, premature ventricular complexes, as well as brady-arrhythmia with 206 advanced atrioventricular nodal block can be observed in myocarditis.

However, immunosuppression might pose a risk for 313 more severe clinical disease, especially when there is active viral replication. Therefore, it is 314 reasonable to withhold or minimize the use of immunosuppression in SARS-CoV-2 patients, 315 especially in the setting of a positive viral genome on EMB.

Many pharmacological agents used empirically to treat 337 COVID-19 including ritonavir/lopinavir and azithromycin are known CYP3A4 inhibitors; 338 hence, their combination therapy with (hydroxy)chloroquine should be accompanied by QTc 339 interval monitoring. 51 340 341 As SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 to gain host cell entry, there is an ongoing debate of 342 whether the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) antagonists should be used in 343 the COVID-19 patients. Some argued that the blockade might offer clinical benefit, 54 whilst 344 others queried the possible upregulation of ACE2 as a consequence of such blockades. 345 However, according to the current clinical evidence, the Heart Failure Society of America, 346 American College of Cardiology and AHA advise continuing the RAAS antagonist regimen 347 if prescribed for their approved indications, even when the patient contracts COVID-19 348 later. 55 Both the AHA and ESC 9,10 advised against the use of NSAIDs in myocarditis patients 349 as they are the known cause of renal impairment and sodium retention which could 350 exacerbate the acute ventricular dysfunction. We summarize our recommendation regarding 351 the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis in Figure 4. 352 353 Conclusion 354 Several cases of coronavirus-related myocarditis have been reported. Its pathophysiology is 355 likely a combination of the direct viral insult to cardiomyocytes and the human's immune 356 response to virally infected myocardium. Simple bedside tests such as serial ECG and cardiac 357 biomarkers can raise suspicion of acute-onset cardiac symptoms. Particular attention should 358 be given to the biomarkers changes or trends and not just a reading in isolation. Cardiac 359 imaging techniques such as echocardiography and CMR can be used to aid diagnosis; 360 however, distinguishing between differentials of stress-induced cardiomyopathy, sepsis-361 related cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome can be difficult. An invasive coronary 362 angiogram will often be warranted, especially in older patients. The definitive diagnosis of 363 myocarditis is obtained via EMB and if performing an invasive catheterization, adding an 364 EMB would add little time and no additional risk of infection spread vs. catheterization 365 alone. For patients who cannot undergo CMR, the contrast-enhanced cardiac CT is a swift, 366 reproducible, precise and reliable alternative which can be added to the sequences for high-367 resolution CT of the lungs to evaluate the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Initial 368 treatment for fulminant myocarditis should follow the cardiogenic shock protocol which 369 includes the use of inotropes or vasopressors and mechanical ventilation. Arrhythmias can be 370 managed by temporary cardiac pacing or anti-arrhythmic medications. Then, depending on 371 severity, the patient may require mechanical circulatory support. Cautions must be taken for 372 the use of the NSAIDs and QTc-prolonging drugs in COVID-19 patients as these medications 373 might exacerbate the cardiac symptoms. The proposed pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis. SARS-CoV-2 378 utilizes the spike protein (primed by TMPRSS2) to bind ACE2 to allow cell entry. 379 Intracellular SARS-CoV-2 might impair stress granule formation via its accessory protein. 380 Without the stress granules, the virus is allowed to replicate and damage the cell. Na\u00efve T-381 lymphocytes can be primed for the viral antigens via antigen-presenting cells and 382 cardiotropism by the heart-produced hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The HGF binds c-Met, 383 a HGF receptor on the T-lymphocytes. The primed CD8+ T-lymphocytes migrate to the 384 cardiomyocytes and cause myocardial inflammation through cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In 385 the cytokine storm syndrome, where pro-inflammatory cytokines are released into the 386 circulation, T-lymphocyte activation is augmented and releases more cytokines. This results 387 in a positive-feedback loop of immune activation and myocardial damage. ACE2 = 388 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; APC = Antigen-presenting cell; HGF = Hepatocyte 389 growth factor; IL-6 = Interleukin-6; MHC = Major histocompatibility complex; TCR = T-cell 390 receptor. 391",
