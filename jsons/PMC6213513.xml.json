For example, during HSV-1 productive infection histone H3 associates with viral DNA at the IE(immediate early) promoters, thereby recruiting the chromatin remodeling factors into viral replication compartments [16,17,18,19], which facilitates viral gene expression and DNA replication. The acetylation of histones on parvoviral DNA is essential for viral gene expression and completion of the viral life cycle [20]. Histone acetylation is essential for influenza A virus infection, since the inhibition of histone acetylation by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors can attenuate its infection [21]. Histone is also involved in BoHV-1 infection because BoHV-1 infection decreases histone H4 acetylation [22], and a portion of intranuclear viral DNA is present in nucleosomes [23], and histone H4 is found to be packaged into virions [24]. However, the role of histone H3 acetylation in BoHV-1 productive infection is still not fully defined.",

For the first time we demonstrated that virus infection significantly reduced histone H3 acetylation, which correlated well with the pronounced depletion of HATs including CBP/P300 (CREB binding protein and p300), GCN5L2 (general control of amino acid synthesis yeast homolog like 2) and PCAF (P300/CBP-associated factor). Moreover, histone acetylation contributed to viral gene expression. Therefore, we concluded that HAT-dependent histone H3 acetylation plays an important role in BoHV-1 replication in MDBK cells.",

To understand the mechanisms underlying the decreased histone H3 acetylation by virus infection, we initially detected the protein levels of CBP/p300, PCAF, and GCN5L2 following BoHV-1 infection at 4, 12, and 24 hpi. Virus infection altered the expression of CBP/p300, PCAF, and GCN5L2, only at 24 hpi, all of them were robustly decreased in comparison to the mock infected control (Figure 2A).

In this study, the expression of HDAC1-4 in response to virus infection was detected using Western blots. As can be seen in Figure 2C,D, virus infection altered the expression of both HDAC1 and HDAC3 with distinct manners, while neither HDAC2 nor HDAC4 were apparently affected. At 24 hpi, the expression levels of HDAC1 and HDAC3 were decreased to approximately 49.6% and 6.8% relative to the control, respectively. The unexpected decreased expression levels of both HDAC1 and HDAC3 may undermine the finding that virus infection decreased the acetylation of histone H3. Taken together, virus infection altered the expression of HATs and HDACs with distinct manners. Relative to HDACs, the prominently decreased expression of HATs strongly supported the reduced acetylation of histone H3 at 24 hpi.",

Therefore, the role of HATs and HDACs in BoHV-1 productive infection was independently investigated using HAT inhibitor anacardic acid (AA) and HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), respectively. AA specifically inhibits the enzymatic activity of HATs, such as CBP/p300 and PCAF, and thereby affects HAT-dependent gene transcription [32]. Also, AA has been reported to have multiple other biological effects such as antitumor activity and antioxidant activity [33]. In this study, we found that the treatment of virus-infected cells with HAT inhibitor AA at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM resulted in a 1.4- and 2.6-log reduction of the virus titer comparing to that in the mock-treated control, respectively (Figure 3A). Indeed, 5 \u03bcM of AA treatment could inhibit histone H3 acetylation as demonstrated by the reduced levels of H3K9ac relative to the control, but AA increased the levels of H3K9ac in the context of virus infection in comparison to the mock treated but infected cells (Figure 3E,F). Maybe the significantly decreased progeny virus by AA treatment led to rescuing the depletion of H3K9ac attributed to virus infection.",

In this study, we used much fewer concentrations of TSA to investigate its role in BoHV-1 replication. We found that the treatment with 100 nM of TSA could restore histone H3 acetylation (Figure 3G,H), but had no impact on the viral replication because the virus titer was only increased ~0.2 log (equal to 2-fold), with a difference not statistically significant (p > 0.05) (Figure 3B). Of note, all the concentrations used for indicated inhibitors had no cytotoxicity to MDBK cells (Figure 3E). But we noticed that in the context of virus infection the cell viability was reduced to approximately 96.2% by TSA (100 nM) treatment (Figure 3I), which is a possible reason for why TSA treatment could not evidently booster viral replication. These results suggested that the maintenance of HAT activities was essential for virus productive infection.",

To identify whether the ubiquitin-proteasome and/or lysosome pathways are involved in the reduced acetylation of histone H3 at 24 h after infection, the virus-infected MDBK cells were treated with either proteasome inhibitor MG132 or lysosome inhibitor NH4Cl throughout infection as determined elsewhere [35,37]. The treatment of MG132 (1 \u03bcM) reversed the depletion of both H3K9ac and H3K18ac attributed to virus infection, and rescued their expression to a level higher than that in the uninfected control, whereas NH4Cl treatment did not show any effect (Figure 5A,B). The increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins in MG132-treated cells but not in NH4Cl-treated cells confirmed the efficiency of MG132 as an inhibitor for the proteasome pathway in MDBK cells (Figure 5C). Though the concentration of MG132 used in this study did not show obvious cytotoxicity to MDBK cells (Figure 5F), the chemical may have off-target effects. So, another proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was employed to validate the rescued effects of MG132. As expected, bortezomib at a concentration of 2 nM showing no cytotoxicity to MDBK cells could reverse BoHV-1-reduced expression of histone acetylation marker H3K9ac to a level a little bit higher than that in the uninfected control (Figure 5D\u2013F), though bortezomib showed relative lower capability than MG132. These results suggested that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may contribute to the decreased acetylation of histone H3 in the virus infected cells.",

Unexpectedly, when we performed IP with the H3K9ac specific monoclonal antibody, the ubiquitinated protein bands could not be detected in the cells with or without infection using ubiquitin specific antibody (Figure 6A), indicating that H3K9ac is not ubiquitinated in MDBK cells.

Therefore, IP was performed with GCN5L2 specific monoclonal antibody, and ubiquitin specific antibody was used to detect the ubiquitination of GCN5L2 in the cell cultures. As a result, the ubiquitinated GCN5L2 could be detected from the IP sample by the immunoblot using ubiquitin specific antibody (Figure 6D).

Hyperacetylation of histones is associated with an \u201copen chromatin\u201d conformation and transcriptional activation, whilst hypoacetylation of histones is associated with condensed chromatin and gene silencing [38,39]. For some DNA viruses, such as HSV-1 and canine parvovirus, much is known about the effects of histone modification on virus replication. During HSV-1 productive infection, the viral genomes are associated with histones immediately after injection into the nucleus, and viral proteins ICP0 and VP16 are required to enhance histone acetylation on the viral genome to enable efficient viral gene expression [18,40]. During canine parvovirus infection, cellular histones are associated with viral DNA, and histone acetylation on parvoviral DNA is essential for viral gene expression [20]. BoHV-1 tegument protein VP22 associates with histones and thereby decreased histone H4 acetylation in infected cells or VP22 transfected cells [22]. In this study, for the first time we demonstrated that histone H3 acetylation (H3K9ac and H3K18ac) was significantly decreased during BoHV-1 infection in MDBK cells, and peaked at 24 h after infection (Figure 1), which suggested the involvement of histone H3 acetylation in BoHV-1 infection.",

We found that the virus infection led to a global decrease of all the detected HATs, including CBP/p300, GCN5L2 and PCAF (Figure 2A), which was clearly in favor of the finding that virus infection decreased histone H3 acetylation (Figure 1). However, it seems that downregulation of both HDAC1 and HDAC3 by virus infection was not correlated with the decreased levels of histone H3 acetylation, which emphasized the complexity of the mechanisms for the regulation of histone acetylation following virus infection. It has been reported that HDAC1 regulates influenza A virus (IAV) replication independent of its deacetylation activity [41]. HDAC1 stimulates host type I interferon antiviral response, therefore IAV infection decreases HDAC1 expression for efficient replication [35]. The treatment with TSA, an HDAC inhibitor, increases IAV infection via the inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription I (STAT1) pathway, and the depression of interferon-stimulated genes including IFITM3, ISG15, and viperin in IAV-infected cells [35]. HDAC3 is required for inflammatory gene expression in response to LPS stimulation [42]. So, HDAC1 and HDAC3 can stimulate host antiviral response or inflammatory response, which tend to be depressed by virus infection. Moreover, HDAC inhibitors promote HSV-1 productive infection in neural cells [43,44]. Likewise, we found that TSA enhanced BoHV-1 virus yield approximately 2-fold, but the difference was not statistically significant (Figure 3). Therefore, we assumed that the downregulation of HDAC1 and HADC3 would be beneficial for BoHV-1 efficient replication independent of their deacetylation activity, which needs further extensive studies, in the future.",

Here, we found that the ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitors could reverse the depletion of acetylated H3 in BoHV-1 infected cells (Figure 3). Mechanistically, the virus infection targeted GCN5L2 but not acetylated histone H3 for proteasome-mediated degradation (Figure 6), which may consequently reduce the acetylation of histone H3. Previous studies have reported that some BoHV-1-encoded viral proteins promote the proteasome-mediated degradation of certain cellular proteins. For example, both interferon response factor 3 (IRF3) and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) are targeted by viral proteins bICP0 for proteasome-dependent degradation [45,46]. Viral UL49.5 protein is involved in the proteasome-mediated degradation of the transporter associated with antigen presentation [47]. The BoHV-1 host shutoff protein UL41 destabilizes the expression of immune responses related genes by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [48]. Taken together, the above evidence indicates that virus-encoded proteins may target specific cellular proteins for proteasome-dependent degradation. Whether a specific viral protein(s) is involved in the depletion of GCN5L2 through proteasome pathway is an interesting subject which is remained to be determined in the future.",

This finding is supported by a previous report that CBP/p300, an HAT, enhances BoHV-1 productive infection and transactivation of late viral protein gC promoter [49]. Taken together, these findings suggested that BoHV-1 infection may take advantage of histone acetylation for efficient replication. We speculated that HAT-dependent histone H3 acetylation plays an important role in BoHV-1 replication in MDBK cells.",

We demonstrated that histone acetylation played an important role in BoHV-1 replication, while the virus infection decreased histone H3 acetylation by differentially altered expression of HATs and HDACs. In addition, virus infection targeted GCN5L2 for degradation via the proteasome pathway, which correlated well with the reversed depletion of H3K9ac by the treatment of MG132 in the virus-infected cells. We suggested that the HAT-dependent histone (H3) acetylation plays an important role in BoHV-1 replication in MDBK Cells",
