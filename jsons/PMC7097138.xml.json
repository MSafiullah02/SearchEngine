Patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 (insulin-independent) diabetes develop secondary complications, the risk of which is related to the duration of diabetes and the degree of glycaemic control2. The organs that are susceptible to diabetic complications exhibit insulin-independent glucose uptake and possess the glucose-metabolizing enzyme aldose reductase. Therefore, initial interest focused on hyperglycaemia and the subsequent increased glucose flux that is mediated by aldose reductase and the rest of the polyol pathway as a primary pathogenic insult that initiates diabetic complications3.",

Assorted animal models have been used to dissect the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular complications of diabetes and to identify possible therapeutic targets. Macrovascular complications have been studied using both rodent and larger animal models, such as rabbits, dogs, pigs and non-human primates; each species has its advantages and pitfalls. For example, although diabetes enhances vascular permeability in rodents14, advanced atherosclerosis is absent in this model, largely owing to the highly effective lipid-clearance mechanisms that are found in these species15. Rodent models that combine hyperglycaemia with dietary modulation or genetic modifications to induce hyperlipidaemia and promote atherosclerosis have therefore been developed. However, a consequence of combined hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia in some of the well-studied mouse models, such as apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with concurrent type 1 diabetes, is that cholesterol levels are higher in diabetic animals compared with non-diabetic animals16. This makes it difficult to assess the relative contributions of glucose and/or lipids in driving the acceleration of atherosclerosis.",

First, to assess the relative roles of hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia, mice lacking the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) were crossed with transgenic mice expressing a viral protein under the control of the insulin promoter. When infected with the virus, the mice developed type 1 diabetes. In diabetic animals that were kept on a cholesterol-free diet, atherosclerosis was accelerated compared with non-diabetic animals, suggesting that hyperglycaemia drove accelerated atherosclerosis. However, when the mice were fed diets that were high in cholesterol (which rendered them diabetic), they developed severe hypertriglyceridaemia and advanced atherosclerosis17. These studies suggest that diabetes-associated dyslipidaemia accelerated lesion progression. Recent studies using this model have also shown that induction of type 1 diabetes in LDLR-deficient mice promoted plaque disruption, as measured by intraplaque haemorrhage18. Interestingly, plaque disruption was associated with the accumulation of monocytes that expressed S100 calcium-binding protein A9, a marker of inflammation.",

The key to discovering treatments that target cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes lies in identifying the molecular species that promote perturbation of the vessel wall. Extensive epidemiological evidence suggests that glucose is one of the key players in this process26,27. Both the direct and indirect consequences of increased blood glucose levels contribute to the pathogenesis of accelerated cardiovascular disease in diabetes. In the macrovasculature, high levels of glucose probably synergize with superimposed stresses that are common to both diabetes and non-diabetic vascular disease, such as raised levels of serum lipids, hypertension and the sequelae of innate ageing processes, to continuously stress vascular cells. Such mechanisms lead not only to primary vascular dysfunction, but also to chronic cycles of stress that injure surrounding cells, which are dependent on intact vascular function. As summarized in Fig. 2, excess glucose directly stimulates activation of the polyol pathway3 and also the activity of mitochondria28, protein kinase C (PKC)29 and NADPH oxidase30,31, which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hyperglycaemia also leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE), which irrevocably alter the diabetic vasculature, leading to vascular stiffening owing to extensive protein cross-linking32. Moreover, extracellular AGE also bind and activate the signal transduction receptor RAGE (receptor of AGE). RAGE is a multi-ligand receptor, and its interactions with AGE and non-AGE pro-inflammatory ligands, such as S100\u2013calgranulins and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), are potent generators of accelerated vascular inflammation31,33. The importance of these pathways has been further suggested by recent studies involving the generation of unique mouse models. For example, the role of RAGE has been examined in both non-diabetic34 and diabetic35 mice deficient for the genes that encode apolipoprotein E and RAGE, and these studies have shown that RAGE has a pivotal role in atherosclerosis.",

The insights gained from experimental models such as those described above have led to clinical trials investigating antagonism of the polyol pathway36, PKC isoforms (particularly PKC\u03b237,38), AGE39,40 and agents that counter the effect of the enhanced generation of ROS caused by high glucose levels, such as benfotiamine41. New small molecule ligands that antagonize RAGE and humanized chimeric soluble RAGE are also being tested in early clinical trials (see the 6-Month safety and efficacy study of TTP488 in patients with type 2 diabetes and persistent albuminuria). Long-term success in treating the blood vessels of patients with diabetes will probably lie in identifying combinations of these therapeutic targets, as it is likely that at distinct times and sites in the vessel wall, many mechanisms synergize to cause diabetic vascular stress. Whether suppression of these maladaptive messengers in the vessel wall will also facilitate the recruitment of progenitors and mediate vessel repair is a largely unexplored question. It is plausible that mechanisms which directly injure the vessel wall also disrupt the environmental cues and the flow of repair species and cells to the injured vessel. The long-term safety and tolerability of RAGE antagonism should be more fully investigated, particularly as studies in acute peripheral nerve injury suggest reparative roles for RAGE in inflammatory and axonal element signalling42,43.",

The importance of ambient hyperglycaemia per se in macrovascular disease may have to be reconsidered in the context of findings from two recent clinical trials, which explored the effects of tight glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease55,56. However, there are potential caveats to these studies. The lack of a positive effect on cardiovascular mortality in these studies could be related to the short duration of the trials (<5 years) or poor tolerance of the demanding and extensive therapeutic regimens by older subjects with type 2 diabetes and its many complications. It is also possible that irreversible vascular changes, such as advanced glycation57 or 'hyperglycaemic memory' resulting from previous periods of hyperglycaemia58, could also contribute, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms such as glucose-induced histone modifications that alter vascular gene expression59,60,61. As the effect of diabetes on plasma lipids and blood pressure could also have a substantial role in atherosclerosis, a therapeutic regimen that incorporates antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents along with drugs that target the consequences of hyperglycaemia may ultimately prove to be the most effective approach, as recently highlighted in the follow-up of a study trialling this approach62.",

From a clinical perspective, it is characterized by the onset of proteinuria and a subsequent decline in glomerular filtration rate and ultimate progression to uraemia, which is fatal if left untreated64. The main clinical associations that frequently precede overt diabetic nephropathy are hypertension and poor glycaemic control65. Once nephropathy is established, blood pressure often rises further, but glycaemic control can paradoxically improve as a result of reduced renal insulin clearance66. Both glucose-dependent pathways that are common to vasculopathy and other complications of diabetes (Fig. 2), and more organ-specific mechanisms that are linked to systemic and intraglomerular hypertension (Fig. 3), seem to play important parts in the development and progression of this disease67.",

In particular, drugs that interrupt the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor (AT2) antagonists, are currently considered first-line treatments for diabetic nephropathy, and this therapeutic strategy is incorporated into most national and international treatment guidelines68. This pharmacological approach has been extended by the recent production of the renin inhibitor aliskerin, which also seems to reduce proteinuria, particularly as part of dual therapy with an AT2 antagonist69. The most effective approach to blocking the RAS remains controversial, and various strategies are currently being investigated. With greater understanding of the complexity of the RAS and identification of new components of this pathway, such as ACE2, it has become increasingly evident that there is a complex interaction between the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator arms of the RAS70. Indeed, it seems that an alteration in one component, such as ACE2, can influence the renal response to agents such as ACE inhibitors70. Furthermore, there is often upregulation of upstream components such as renin with distal interruption of the RAS, which can be suppressed by vitamin D administration2,71.",

The classical model of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes in rodents is still widely used and has a range of functional and structural changes that are comparable to human diabetic nephropathy72. These include early development of renal hypertrophy, progressive increases in albuminuria and changes to the renal ultrastructure, such as mesangial expansion and glomerular basement membrane thickening. Unfortunately, more advanced renal disease, specifically overt proteinuria, renal impairment and advanced structural lesions, are not prominent in this model72. New models, such as the Akita73 and OVE26 mice74, have been developed to address this concern and show more advanced lesions. Whether these new mouse strains will ultimately prove to be more useful preclinical models for testing new treatments remains to be determined, and much emphasis is currently being placed on the genetic background of the mice. For example, it has been suggested that manifestations of nephropathy in the Akita mouse model can differ depending on the genetic background of the mice73.",

Initial research focused on the mesangial cells within the glomerulus, but changes in other glomerular cells, including podocytes76, and progressive injury to the tubulointerstitium have subsequently been described77. Glucose-dependent pathways (Fig. 2), such as advanced glycation78, are clearly important components in the pathogenesis of diabetic renal disease and accompany organ-specific mechanisms involving disruption of vasoactive hormone pathways, such as the RAS79. Glucose and AGE-mediated activation of RAGE78,80, key intracellular signalling molecules such as PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase, and angiotensin II also have a central role in this disease79. Furthermore, certain pro-sclerotic growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b277,81 and connective tissue growth factor82, seem to promote extracellular matrix accumulation, a cardinal structural feature of the kidney in patients with diabetes. It is also becoming increasingly apparent that metabolic and haemodynamic pathways not only interact through common mediators, such as intracellular signalling molecules and growth factors, but can directly interact with each other. For example, angiotensin II can enhance AGE accumulation in the kidney and AGE can directly modulate expression of key components of the RAS83. Thus, it seems that metabolic and haemodynamic stimuli, triggered by the diabetic milieu, interact to amplify injury and perpetuate the progression of renal damage in diabetes (Fig. 3).",

Some of these clinical trials have now been completed85, whereas others are still in progress86 (Table 1). These trials are focusing primarily on albuminuria as an index of nephropathy, as well as assessing the decline in renal function. Because diabetic nephropathy takes many years to evolve and only occurs in a minority of subjects, these clinical trials have often been difficult to complete. Moreover, the US Food and Drug Administration currently considers renal impairment, and not proteinuria, as the appropriate renal end point of diabetic nephropathy. This requires studies that often involve more than 1,000 patients and a follow-up of up to 5 years87,88. Such studies are difficult to carry out in terms of recruitment and are expensive.",

Many research groups are trying to identify alternative biomarkers of renoprotection, and much of this work focuses on urine proteomics91. This research is at an early phase, and a biomarker has not yet been established. Ultimately, the goal is to develop more robust strategies for monitoring diabetic nephropathy and in particular to generate a more reliable approach to identifying truly renoprotective regimens that not only decrease albuminuria but also reduce renal morphological injury and preserve renal function.",

It is characterized by a range of retinal lesions and abnormalities that indicate vascular damage (capillary microaneurysms, capillary degeneration, increased vascular permeability and new vessel formation) and death or dysfunction of the neural retina ('cotton wool spots', alterations in retinal electrophysiology, loss of colour or hue discrimination). Clinically, diabetic retinopathy has been separated into non-proliferative and proliferative disease stages. Only the late stages of the retinopathy, especially neovascularization and retinal oedema, have adverse effects on vision93, but these disorders seem to be dependent on changes that develop in the earlier stages of the disease. New vessels growing out of the retina into the normally avascular vitreous fluid are particularly threatening for vision owing to excessive leakage from these new vessels (pre-retinal haemorrhage) or to the development of a fibrovascular membrane93. Available evidence suggests that occlusion or degeneration of retinal capillaries is strongly associated with the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy94, presumably by contributing to the development of ischaemia and the subsequent release of hypoxia-inducible vasoproliferative factors. Accumulation of fluid within the retina also contributes to the visual impairment in diabetes, in part by distorting the retinal architecture93.",

Development of retinopathy in many of these models occurs more rapidly than in humans, with early lesions developing within months to years of the onset of diabetes. The severity of retinal disease increases with duration of diabetes, but remains mild compared with that seen in many patients with diabetes. This is due in part to the limited lifespan of laboratory animals. With the exception of occasional contrary claims, diabetes alone has not been found to cause pre-retinal (intravitreal) neovascularization in any animal model98. Again, this is probably due in part to insufficient severity of capillary degeneration and other lesions during the limited time over which these models have been studied. No data have yet been generated to suggest that the current animal models are inappropriate reflections of human diabetic retinopathy because they are mechanistically inadequate. Instead, the development and appearance of early retinopathy is similar in many diverse animal models of diabetes, in which the differences in the severity of retinopathy are related to the differences in the severity of hyperglycaemia.",

The observation that diabetic-like retinopathy develops following a long-term increase in galactose levels in the blood, even in the absence of diabetes, provides strong evidence that hyperglycaemia per se, as opposed to insulin deficiency or alterations in lipid profile that are characteristic of poor diabetic control, is sufficient to initiate the development of aspects of retinopathy in mice108 and rats109,110. However, disorders that commonly parallel hyperglycaemia in patients with diabetes, such as altered blood pressure and dyslipidaemia, have been found to influence the rate of progression of retinopathy27,111. In recent years, there has been a great increase in the number of potential therapies that are reported to inhibit the diabetes-induced degeneration of retinal capillaries and neurons as well as the increase in retinal vascular permeability in animals. These range from pan-complication therapies, such as aldose reductase inhibitors, to tissue-specific approaches, such as anti-VEGF agents103. Likewise, the range of therapies that have been found to inhibit retinal neovascularization in non-diabetes animal models is expanding and includes both those with potential efficacy against many diabetic complications, such as PKC\u03b2 inhibitors, and those that specifically inhibit mechanisms of retinopathy, such as blocking VEGF signalling112.",

Overall, this agent had a positive effect, with reduced progression and in some groups regression of retinopathy as measured by the ETDRS scale. There is also increasing evidence of benefits from intravitreal injections of steroids such as triamcinolone, often in conjunction with laser photocoagulation on vision-threatening retinopathy, including diffuse macular oedema121,122. However, there are risks associated with intraocular steroid therapy, including increased intraocular pressure and enhanced cataract formation. Several other clinical trials have not produced the outcomes that were hoped for, probably owing in part to insufficient study duration, slow development or progression of retinopathy, insufficient inhibition of the therapeutic target or a lack of involvement of the therapeutic target in the pathogenesis of the retinopathy123,124,125,126.",

These manifestations of neuropathy, along with their contribution to impaired wound healing and cardiovascular and erectile dysfunction, can severely reduce a patient's quality of life. As with the other complications discussed above, duration of diabetes and lack of adequate glycaemic control are important risk factors for neuropathy in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes26,116. No therapy for diabetic degenerative neuropathy, other than maintenance of normoglycaemia, is approved by regulatory bodies in Europe and the United States, and current pain management strategies are not consistently effective and do not target the causes of diabetes-induced pain.

Longer durations of diabetes may produce discernable pathology in nerve trunks of some rodent models137,138, and the retraction of small sensory fibre terminals in the skin of short-term rodent models of diabetes139,140 offers a measurement of nerve pathology that can be used in drug screening assays.

Several neuroactive proteins and polypeptides have been investigated as replacement therapies to counteract impaired neurotrophic support150 but difficulties with delivery routes and systemic effects have impeded clinical development. Small molecules that promote endogenous production of neurotrophic factors have also shown some success in diabetic rodents154,155,156. Most recently, gene therapy to facilitate endogenous production of nerve growth factor157,158, hepatocye growth factor159, neurotrophin 3 (Ref. 160) or VEGF161,162 has been explored. Advancement of this approach must clearly incorporate the goal of delivering localized and regulated production of such factors.",

Amyloid-\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau also accumulate in the brain of diabetic rats169 and mice170,171, in which there is evidence of synaptic and neuronal loss.

Although the technique has currently been restricted to the evaluation of small sensory fibres and not of myelinated sensory, motor or autonomic fibres that are also affected by diabetes, it offers the advantage of providing a direct measurement of fibre loss that may ultimately result in loss of thermal sensation. Repeated biopsies can be carried out and allow monitoring of the progression of neuropathy and the effects of drug treatment.",

Moreover, some of these targets may also have additional organ-specific effects that are independent of their impact on vascular function. For example, aldose reductase also localizes in Schwann cells of peripheral nerves and in cells of the kidneys and eyes194,195, whereas RAGE expression is induced or increased by diabetes in each of these organs independently of its expression in blood vessels78,196,197.

The use of these models is driven in part by the desire of researchers to accelerate the onset of complications in inexpensive species that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Although current rodent models are useful for identifying the initial pathogenesis of diabetic complications and for studying the effect of potential prophylactic and early interventional therapies, there is persistent uncertainly as to whether investigators are studying mechanisms and drugs that are pertinent to overt pathological damage in humans. Another recurring theme is the difficulty in designing viable clinical trials and identifying which end points should be used as indicators of therapeutic efficacy. It is clear that the regulatory bodies are challenged by conflicting requirements to establish consistent end points which can be used in trials that may take many years to complete, while needing to have the flexibility to adopt new surrogate biomarkers as they are identified and validated by preclinical and clinical studies.",

Nevertheless, new animal models, creative drug delivery systems and improvements in clinical trial design and biomarkers will hopefully combine to accelerate the development of therapies for diabetic complications and improve approaches that are already being investigated. A single drug that is effective against all diabetic complications may not be a realistic goal. Therapeutic strategies that incorporate interventions targeting the glucose-mediated pathogenic axis outlined in Fig. 2, in combination with those that address organ-specific and glucose-independent mechanisms, may provide the most successful approach to drug development in this area.",

Increased extracellular glucose leads to non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins and subsequent formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) that interact with the receptor for AGE (RAGE) on the plasma membrane and promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased intracellular glucose drives mitochondrial activity, increases the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and NADPH oxidase and promotes increased flux through the polyol pathway, all of which have many effects on cellular metabolism and phenotype. This figure highlights the consequences of excessive ROS production in the vasculature, where ROS-driven changes in cell phenotype are mediated by a range of signalling pathways and transcription factors. Cells of the kidneys, eyes and nervous system also undergo cell- and organ-specific phenotypic changes as a result of hyperglycaemia-mediated ROS production. ROS production, ROS-unrelated pathogenic consequences of hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia-independent mechanisms, such as impaired insulin signalling, are likely to collectively mediate the organ-specific pathologies of diabetic complications.
