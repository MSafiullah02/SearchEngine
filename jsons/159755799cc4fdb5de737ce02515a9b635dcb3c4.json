Also, modifications in the poly(I) strand (i.e., 7-N substitution by a CH group) could be introduced without detrimental effects on the IFN-inducing ability of the resulting double-stranded RNA complex [18] . Moving in the other di-rection, by introducing modifications in the poly(C) strand (i.e., interruption of this strand every twelfth or thirteenth cytidine residue by uridine), poly(I)7poly(C) analogues such as poly(I)7poly(C 12 U) were constructed that still induced IFN while being subject to faster degradation by nucleases [19] . This [20] . At the cellular level, it induces IFN synthesis but inhibits host cell protein synthesis, and, at the host level, it stimulates host defense mechanisms but induces both local and systemic toxic side effects [20] . Recently, double-stranded as well as singlestranded RNAs have been postulated to interact with Toll-like receptors 3 and 7 (see, e.g., [21] ), but the authenticity of these interactions remains to be further established.",

Adefovir dipivoxil corresponds to the bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)ester of 9-(2-phosphonomethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA; figure 5 ), a compound that was first mentioned for its antiviral properties in 1986 [24] . Adefovir dipivoxil has proved to be efficacious in the treatment of both e antigennegative and e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B [25, 26] . It has been firmly established that adefovir acts as a chain terminator in the reverse-transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) reaction [27] , and this by itself could explain the reductions in HBV DNA titers achieved in vivo by the therapeutic doses used for adefovir dipivoxil (10 mg/day orally).",

Whether such potential side effects could con- IFN-a (in its pegylated form), in combination with ribavirin, has become the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. In a recent study, Hadziyannis et al. [31] demonstrated that patients infected with HCV genotype 1 required treatment with pegylated IFN-a2a (180 mg/week) plus ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg/day) for 48 weeks, whereas patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 seemed to be adequately treated for only 24 weeks with the same dose of pegylated IFN and a lower dose (800 mg/day) of ribavirin. Therefore, at least in the long term, hepatitis C may be better managed by IFN and ribavirin when caused by HCV genotypes 2 or 3 rather than by genotype 1. The mechanistic basis for this differential behavior remains to be unraveled.",

Ribavirin had relatively weak antiviral activity in the HCV (genotype 1b) replicon system (we have not yet examined the effects of IFN and ribavirin in HCV replicon systems with other genotypes).

In fact, VSV could be considered a surrogate virus of the filoviruses, in that anti-VSV activity may be predictive of activity against filoviruses. This premise has been borne out with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitors such as 3-deazaneplanocin A (figure 7); on the basis of its activity against VSV [44] , it was tested in treating Ebola virus infections in mice, and a single dose protected the mice against a lethal challenge with Ebola virus [41] .",

Considering the unequaled potency of doublestranded RNAs in inducing IFN, I hypothesize that, as an Sadenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, 3-deazaneplanocin leads to the accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine, which, being a product and inhibitor of methyltransferase reactions using S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor, will inhibit these methylation reactions, including those that are required for the 5 -capping of the viral mRNA [45] . In the case of negativestranded RNA viruses (such as Ebola), this means that the positive-stranded RNA (transcribed from the minus strand by the RNA replicase) is not processed and remains attached to the negative-stranded RNA, thus resulting in increased double-stranded RNA formation and, consequently, IFN induction. Further experiments should be undertaken to validate this hypothesis.",
