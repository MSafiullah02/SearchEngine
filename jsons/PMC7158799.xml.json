The global shut down worldwide has led to fewer imports and exports and most pharmaceutical manufacturing firms have shifted their focus to the production of medicines and medical equipment targeted at the fight against COVID-19 in their nations. There seems to be a shift in the restrained import of pharmaceuticals towards battling the current COVID-19 pandemic, thus leaving a huge gap for pharmaceutical imports that target other chronic diseases. This focus by pharma industries will disadvantage LMICs due to the rather vulnerable and inadequate pharmaceutical manufacturing capacities in these countries to meet their general pharmaceutical needs and those for chronic diseases. With limited supply to meet the increased demand created, the market values of medicines for chronic diseases have escalated, making them unaffordable for several patients in LMICs who require them.",

This is to increase medication availability within these times while preventing spread of COVID-19 to vulnerable patient groups. Pharmacists are also collaborating amongst themselves on social platforms to source medications for patients. This does not only enhance availability to medications for patients in need but reduces social interaction of vulnerable chronic disease patients to the pandemic.",

The community pharmacy will therefore be the most patronized health facility for people to either seek for or verify these recommended therapies. Examples of these popular remedies include hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, preparations with high doses of vitamin C, garlic capsules, lemon tinctures and apple cider vinegar. Community pharmacists are thus tasked with the role of providing information on the authenticity of these claims to promote rational use of medicines. For patients with chronic illnesses especially, who are likely to be taking their prescription drugs, wrongful uptake of information translating into irrational use of these other social opinionated remedies might lead to drug interactions with their routine chronic medications.38 In addition, the proper use of over-the-counter medications for managing simple ailments of common occurrence in patients with chronic illness also need to be monitored by community pharmacists. By playing their traditional roles of counselling patients on their medications, the contribution of community pharmacists in supporting rational use of medicines during this COVID-19 pandemic will be emphasized.",

Patients who would have required changes to their medications have been left with old prescriptions to refill and patients who required minor procedures may require medications to stabilize their condition until the procedure can be carried out. Patients affected will have to receive continuous supply of prescription medications and this is where the community pharmacists can be entrusted with the responsibility using their judgement to review such prescriptions and provide appropriate medication review management. For instance, patients on opioid analgesics may have their prescription reviewed by the community pharmacist to prevent tolerance and addiction.
