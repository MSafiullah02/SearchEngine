For example, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) broken out in east Asia early 2003 resulted in the death of hundreds of people, the global panic and the inestimable economic loss. When an emergency occurs, the relevant management personnel or decision-makers (DMs) need to decide what actions to take instantly so as to mitigate or minimize the negative effects. Usually, the decision-making problems in emergency response are complicated due to the limited decision data and possible evolvement of emergency scenarios [1], [2]. Therefore, how to select an effective response action in the earlier stage of emergency is an important research topic of emergency management.",

K\u00f6rte [3] proposed a method named \u2018contingent risk and decision analysis\u2019 to solve the decision-making problems under variable environment. Levy [4] developed a DSS for flood risk management by integrating the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, the remote sensing, GIS, the hydrologic models, and the real-time flood information systems. Based on [4], Levy and Taji [5] proposed a group analytic network process (GANP) approach to provide a support to hazard planning and emergency management under incomplete information. Fu [6] proposed a fuzzy optimization method for selecting the most desirable action to control the flood of reservoir. Geldermann et al. [7] proposed a MCDM-based evaluation method for nuclear remediation management. Lim and Lee [8] proposed a spatial multi-criteria decision analysis approach for evaluating flood damage reduction actions. Yu and Lai [9] proposed a distance-based group decision-making (GDM) method to solve unconventional multi-person multi-criteria emergency decision-making problems. Peng et al. [10] proposed an incident information management framework based on data integration, data mining and multi-criteria decision making. Ergu et al.

In existing studies, various decision-making methods are proposed according to the characteristics of different actual emergency events, such as nuclear accident [1], [7], flood disaster [2], [4], [6], [8] and so on. In some actual emergency situations, like infectious diseases and fire hazards etc., the decision-making problems have dynamic and risky characteristics. This needs to consider a special risk decision-making problem with several distinct characteristics including dynamic evolvement process of emergency, multiple scenarios, and impact of response actions on the emergency scenarios. However, the existing decision analysis methods seldom consider to solve the decision-making problems with the above characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the risk decision-making problem considering the characteristics of dynamic evolvement and multiple scenarios in emergency response.",

By FTA, the occurrence frequency or probability of the system hazardous events can be estimated [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], and the root causes of system hazardous events can be found. In this paper, we incorporate FTA into the analysis of risk decision-making problem with the characteristics of dynamic evolvement and multiple scenarios in emergency response. An emergency with multiple scenarios is regarded as a \u2018system\u2019, the undesirable scenarios of the emergency are regarded as \u2018system hazardous events\u2019, and the conditions and factors resulting in the evolvement of emergency are denoted as middle events and basic events. Accordingly, a fault tree (FT) for the emergency is constructed to describe the logical relations among scenarios, conditions and factors. Based on the constructed FT, the probabilities of emergency scenarios can be estimated with respect to each feasible response action. Furthermore, based on obtained probabilities of emergency scenarios, classical risk decision-making method can be employed to calculate the overall ranking value of each action.",

Since there was no precedent of SARS, an inefficient control action was implemented, which leaded to a rapidly spreading of SARS. In early 2003, more infected cases were successively found in different provinces in China, including, 6 cases in Guangxi province on January 4, 3 cases in Sichuan province on February 10, and 1 case in Hunan province on February 14, etc. SARS continuously spread to other countries and regions by traveling passengers. On February 15, 2003, a doctor from Guangdong province, who had been infected by SARS, arrived at Hongkong, and infected 15 hotel visitors. The infected visitors then traveled to Canada, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, and caused further widely spreading of SARS. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), the SARS disease in 2003 resulted in 8096 known infected cases, 774 confirmed human deaths, the global panic and the inestimable economical loss.",

The core idea is to identify the conditions and factors that emergency can evolve into scenario Sj from scenario Sj\u22121, j=1,2,\u2026,n. The FT should be developed level by level, and each level should be completed before any consideration is given to the next level. To successfully construct the FT for an emergency, the following steps are suggested:\nStep 1. The most undesirable scenario Sn is defined as top event.\nStep 2. Define boundary conditions for the analysis. The boundary conditions include: (1) physical boundaries: define what factors, status and emergency scenarios will be included in the FT as events; (2) boundary conditions concerning environmental stresses: define what external stresses (e.g., virus variation) should be included in the FT as events; (3) level of resolution: determine how far down we should identify the potential reasons for an event in detail.\nStep 3. Classify all events into middle events and basic events. If an event represents a primary factor that may result in the evolvement of emergency, it is classified as a basic event; if an event represents a secondary factor that may result in the evolvement of emergency, it is classified as a middle event that requires a further investigation to identify the prime causes.\nStep 4. Complete the gates. If the upper level event will occur given that a single lower event occurs, then the events should be linked with \u2018OR\u2019 gate; if the upper level event will occur only if two or more lower events occur simultaneously, then the events should be linked with \u2018AND\u2019 gate.\n",

For this, the principle of FTA is introduced, and the steps for constructing the FT for an emergency are given. The attempt to introduce FTA into decision analysis makes it possible to capture the dynamic evolvement process of emergency and estimate the probabilities of emergency scenarios before the response actions are implemented. It is valuable and important for developing and enriching theories and methods of decision analysis in emergency response.",
