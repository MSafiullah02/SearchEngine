It is essential for the clinician to know and implement personal safety procedures before starting the examination. In particular, the physician performing the ultrasound must wear appropriate PPE. In case of a COVID-19 + patient with respiratory symptoms, these items are a surgical mask, gloves, a waterproof gown, and goggles or a visor; in the case of high risk of exposure to aerosols (patients subjected to continuous positive airway pressure or non-invasive ventilation), the use of a FFP2/3 mask, a double pair of gloves, goggles or a visor and boots is recommended. Ultrasound machine and probes must be disinfected with alcohol-based disinfectants before and after ultrasound, and thus equipped with disposable protective materials (probe cover).",

Moreover, B lines are also found in other diseases such as bruises, chronic fibrotic lung diseases and ARDS. ARDS can be distinguished from cardiogenic pulmonary edema by the presence of multifocal and diffuse lung alterations, without a base-apex gradient, while chronic interstitial diseases differ by an extreme irregularity of the pleural line, which can be thickened and distorted, with the presence of focal subpleural interruptions (consolidations), and by the presence of uneven and irregular vertical artifacts (B lines) [7, 16, 17] .",

In more advanced and critical cases, ultrasound findings resemble other pneumonia features, such as Table 1 ) [20] . Therefore, thoracic ultrasound seems suitable for screening for lung involvement of patients with suspected or ascertained SARS-COVID-19 infection due to its easy applicability. It can be also a relevant method for monitoring patients. Indeed, follow-up of the previously described ultrasound findings according to the pre-established scan scheme can document improvements in or the worsening of the disease. It can thus, together with clinical-laboratory data, prompt therapeutic modifications. In an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, ultrasound can be a support for lung recruitment maneuvers, by assisting clinicians in ascertaining the possible re-expansion of the atelectasis areas (from consolidation to aerial artifacts).",
