A multi-objective graph model (MOGM) is proposed to balance each DM's objectives in both two-DM and multi-DM conflicts. To identify Nash stability in MOGMs, a comprehensive preference matrix with weight parameters on objectives is developed for each DM, along with a unilateral move matrix including preference weights (UMP). Then, considering the subjective uncertainty of DMs, interval numbers are used to represent the degree of uncertainty of preference. Subsequently, Nash equilibria and interval Nash equilibria are developed for MOGMs, and the dependence of these equilibria on weights is shown. To illustrate how MOGM can be applied in practice and provide valuable strategic insights, it is used to investigate a US-China trade dispute model. The stability results suggest potential strategic resolutions of bilateral trade disputes, and how DMs can attain them. The case analysis process suggests that a peaceful settlement of the dispute may be achievable.",

There are essentially three kinds of conflict: conflicts among several decision makers (DMs), conflicts within an individual, and conflicts within and among individuals. The first kind of conflict is studied in conventional game theory, where each DM tries to maximize a scalar payoff. The second kind can be seen as the subject of individual decision theory. The third kind, involving several DMs as well as within each DM, is modeled by a multi-objective game, which reflects that DMs in the game may have several objectives, possibly conflicting.",

Borm et al. [4] considered the general two-person bi-matrix game and studied its comparative statics. Charnes et al. [5] proposed the more general n-person MONCG, but limited all DMs' choices to a cross-constrained set. Zhao [6] defined cooperative, non-cooperative, hybrid and quasi-hybrid solution concepts for multi-objective games and proved their existence. Yu [7] also studied the existence of Nash equilibrium and Pareto equilibrium for MONCG. Most of these studies define and prove existence for various solutions, but there are often no effective computational techniques to obtain the equilibrium solution.",

Assuming that a DM has a fuzzy goal for each objective which can also be interpreted as a DM's degree of satisfaction for a payoff, Nishizaki and Sakawa [8] studied multi-objective fuzzy two-person zero-sum and non-zero-sum games. They considered the relation of equilibrium solutions for multi-objective two-person games combining fuzzy goals with the Pareto optimal equilibrium solutions defined in Borm [4] . However, in existing research on MONCGs, the payoff in each state is interpreted as a utility value. When game theory is applied to real world problems, it is often difficult to assess utilities exactly, but it is easier to determine the relative payoffs, or order of preference, of the states.",

Xu et al. [12, 13] devised matrix representations for calculating individual stability and equilibria for GMCR. Explicit algebraic formulations allow users to develop algorithms conveniently in order to assess the stabilities of states and permitted new solution concepts to be integrated into the decision support system GMCR II [14, 15] . Li et al. [16] proposed a new preference structure for the graph model to handle uncertainty in DMs' preferences and redefined several solution concepts with preference uncertainty. Bashar et al. [17] and Hipel et al. [18] developed a methodology to model and analyze a conflict with fuzzy preferences. Ke [19, 20] designed a multiple criteria decision analysis approach and incorporated an analytic hierarchy process to capture the relative preference information of a DM involved in a conflict through defining fuzzy preference relation. The ideas of grey and probabilistic preferences were also incorporated into the graph model methodology from different viewpoints by Kuang et al. [21] and Rego and dos Santos [22] .

The comprehensive preference matrix with weight parameters on objectives and the UMP preference for MOGM is developed. Furthermore, the subjective uncertainty of DMs is considered. Interval numbers are used to express the degree of uncertainty of preference. Subsequently, Nash equilibrium and interval Nash equilibrium solution methods are developed for MOGMs and the dependence of equilibria on weights of objectives is also shown. A detailed modeling and calculation process in US-China trade dispute is also explained and demonstrated. The implications and in-depth result analysis for DMs have been given. The MOGM provides DMs with guidance for how to act strategically in bilateral trade disputes that occur in the real world. Further studies can be carried out within MOGM. A preference structure to incorporate random uncertainty and probability deserves further research. Nash stability for MOGM is developed in this paper. For other classical stabilities for MOGM, such as GMR, SMR and SEQ, the definitions and the solution methods still need to be studied.

The \u00f0i; j\u00de entry in the matrix\u0124 t \u00f0x t \u00de is\u0124 t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de \u00bc \u00bdH t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de; H t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de.The logical definition of Nash stability of the MOGM with interval preference weights is given as follows.Definition 7. For MOGM with interval preference weights, state s i 2 S is interval Nash stable for DM t iff x t satisfies\u0124 t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de 0 for all j 6 \u00bc i; j \u00bc 1; 2; \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 ; m. Since\u0124 t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de is an interval number, one can obtain different results on H t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de \u00bc \u00bdH t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de; H t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de \u00bd0; 0 by using different ranking methods on interval numbers. In this paper, assume that\u0124 t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de 0 iff H t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de H t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de 0. Thus, the following Definition 8 on interval Nash equilibrium is proposed for MOGM with interval preference weights. Definition 8. Fix s i 2 S. If s i is interval Nash stable for DM t, then interval preference weight x t satisfies H t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de 0 for all j 6 \u00bc i; j \u00bc 1; 2; \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 ; m. Moreover, for all x t ; t 2 N, the area defined by the intersection D \u00bc T t 2 N j 6 \u00bc i fx t : H t;x t \u00f0i; j\u00de 0g is the location of the Nash equilibrium.",
