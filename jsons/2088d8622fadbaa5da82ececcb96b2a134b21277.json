The upper airway is a reservoir for microbial communities including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, and these have implications for respiratory health and disease. However, current research into the etiology of ARIs focuses primarily on viruses, most notably respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinoviruses (RV). The bacterial microbiome is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the susceptibility and severity of ARIs, as well as non-communicable respiratory diseases such as asthma (de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2015; Durack et al., 2016; Man et al., 2017; Vissers et al., 2014) .

These independent studies in different human populations have reported strikingly similar findings. Firstly, the NPM appears to be simple in structure, with distinct profiles dominated by a single bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or genus. A Staphylococcus-dominated profile can be observed in early infancy (from 1 week) but its prevalence decreases sharply over the first year, to be replaced by Corynebacterium-, Alloiococcus (Dolosigranulum)-, or Moraxella-dominated profiles, with transient incursions of Streptococcus-or Haemophilus-dominated profiles during ARIs. Secondly, NPM composition influences both microbiota stability and ARI risk and severity. One study of 60 infants from the Netherlands in the first two years of life reported a Moraxella-dominated or mixed Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum profile at 1.5 months of age was associated with high NPM stability and low frequency of parent-reported ARIs in the subsequent period (Biesbroek et al., 2014) . Our study of 234 infants from Australia in the first year of life also found that Moraxella-dominated and Alloiococcus-dominated profiles were more stable than others, but a Moraxella-dominated NPM at 2 months of age was associated with earlier onset of first ARI . There were also common environmental correlates of the NPM that differed slightly across studies but included mode of delivery, infant feeding, season, crowding or exposure to other children, recent antibiotic use, and prior infections.

Here, we investigated whether presence of the illness-associated Moraxella, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus MPGs during the first four years of life was predictive of LRI intensity during the same period, and/or wheeze at age 5. For each child, we calculated the combined frequency of these MPGs among healthy NPM samples over different time periods (STAR Methods).

We also note that LRI frequency in years 3-4 was associated with wheeze at age 5 regardless of sensitization status, which we attribute to recent respiratory inflammation being more directly linked to current wheeze (Table 2 ).

We found the NPM from birth to 5 years of age remains dominated by six common genera ( Figure 1) and has yet to converge to an adult-like NPM, which is characterized by much greater alpha diversity, lack of Moraxella and Corynebacterium, and much lower biomass (Stearns et al., 2015) . This is in contrast to the oropharynx (Stearns et al., 2015) or the gut microbiome, which matures to an adult-like state by 3 years of age (Yatsunenko et al., 2012) . The NPM is composed of robust internally homogeneous MPGs, consistent with existing literature pointing to discrete microbial compositions in the nasopharynx during early childhood (Biesbroek et al., 2014; Bisgaard et al., 2007; Bogaert et al., 2011; Bosch et al., 2017; Teo et al., 2015;  (D) Frequency of pre-school wheeze phenotypes (y axis), stratified by frequency of Moraxella, Streptococcus, or Haemophilus MPGs among healthy samples collected from 6 months to 2 years of age (x axis, in tertiles). Data are shown separately for 73 children who were allergic sensitized by 2 years of age, and 64 who were not. See also Figures S5 and S7 . Tsai et al., 2015) . Consistent with previous observations (Biesbroek et al., 2014), we found a constant level of NPM diversity over the first two years of life, followed by a period of increasing diversity, in terms of both number and equitability of OTUs, for at least 3 years (Figures 2A and S3 ). This increasing diversity coincided with a change in the relationship between the NPM and respiratory disease, whereby negative associations between MPGs and ARI became attenuated (as in the case of Corynebacterium) or changed direction to become positively associated with ARI (Alloiococcus) ( Figure 3A ). In the latter case, this appears to be driven by an increasing alliance with Moraxella (Figures 3B and 4) , which itself was ARI associated. Moraxella establishes biofilms that enhance the co-survival of pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (Pearson et al., 2006; Perez et al., 2014) . It is not yet clear whether the negative associations of certain taxa with ARI denote active protective effects, or simply the lack of pathogenic drivers of symptoms; however, there is some evidence from murine models that pre-exposure to Corynebacterium can provide some resistance against RSV infection (Kanmani et al., 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 534, "text": "(Stearns et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 575, "end": 597, "text": "(Stearns et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 676, "end": 701, "text": "(Yatsunenko et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 885, "end": 909, "text": "(Biesbroek et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 910, "end": 932, "text": "Bisgaard et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 933, "end": 954, "text": "Bogaert et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 955, "end": 974, "text": "Bosch et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 975, "end": 992, "text": "Teo et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 993, "end": 993, "text": "", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1368, "text": "Tsai et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2235, "text": "(Pearson et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2255, "text": "Perez et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2563, "end": 2585, "text": "(Kanmani et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 347, "text": "Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1347, "text": "Figures S5 and S7", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1647, "text": "(Figures 2A and S3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1946, "end": 1955, "text": "Figure 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2064, "text": "(Figures 3B and 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our longitudinal data show the NPM can be highly dynamic within individuals.

Notably, stability of the Alloiococcus-Corynebacterium MPG was significantly reduced by LRI episodes, which are typically associated with an influx and/or overgrowth of Moraxella, Streptococcus, or Haemophilus that can presumably destabilize the bacterial community. This is consistent with a recent study that reported reduced stability of the NPM during infancy among children who experienced more than two ARIs in the first year of life (Bosch et al., 2017) . Ultimately, more comprehensive description of natural NPM dynamics, including detailed assessment of resilience to exogenous agents, will require higher-resolution sampling (weekly or daily) and would also benefit from larger cohorts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 780, "end": 800, "text": "(Bosch et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 184, "text": "Figures 4C  and 4D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Throughout the first five years of life, NPM samples collected during ARIs showed a greater abundance of, and were more commonly dominated by, specific Streptococcus, Moraxella, and Haemophilus OTUs (Figures 1 and 3 ; Table S2 ), consistent with expectations regarding common respiratory pathogens S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and H. influenzae to which these OTU sequences were most closely related (Table S1 ). The relative abundances of these OTUs were significantly correlated with one another ( Figure 4A ); we hypothesize that this is related to the protection provided by the Moraxella biofilm (Tan et al., 2007) , which can release outer membrane surface proteins that protect other bacteria from complement-dependent killing. Other groups have previously reported reduced upper airway microbial diversity during or prior to ARIs (Frank et al., 2010; Santee et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2014) ; our data support this, in terms of both enrichment of a small number of community profiles (MPGs) during ARI, and a higher abundance of ARI-associated OTUs and lower alpha diversity within these MPGs compared with that observed in the absence of ARI symptoms (Figures 2B and S3 ; Tables S2 and S3). We therefore propose that overgrowth of these particular taxa may tip the balance toward respiratory symptomatology, either by direct action as invasive pathogens or via indirect dysregulation of the local immunological milieu. Such dysregulation may increase the likelihood of a primary viral infection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa, or subsequent spread of infection to the lower airways, as suggested in our earlier study on this cohort during infancy . This is further supported by the increased prevalence of Moraxella in asymptomatic samples collected 1-2 weeks before an LRI ( Figure 5C ). Most LRIs (>80%) had a known respiratory virus present, and this is likely the trigger for acute symptoms. However, the lack of enrichment for viruses, but enrichment for Moraxella, in the 1-2 weeks preceding LRI suggests that having the bacteria present when the virus is encountered increases the likelihood of severe respiratory illness. While our study had insufficient power to detect similar effects for Streptococcus and Haemophilus, due to low colonization frequency in our cohort, there is a large body of evidence accumulating around specific mechanisms of interaction between human respiratory viruses (mainly RV, RSV, and influenza) and S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis; including both viral promotion of bacterial colonization and outgrowth (for which we see evidence in the form of increased abundance of pathogenic genera in ARIs), and bacterial promotion of viral receptor expression on host cells (Bosch et al., 2017; Brealey et al., 2015) . While the present study cannot address specific mechanisms it provides evidence for interactions in both directions, and demonstrates that bacterial colonization influences subsequent ARI throughout infancy and early childhood. Finally, we found a significant relationship between asymptomatic colonization of the upper airways by certain MPGs in the first two years of life and later wheezing phenotypes, conditional on early allergic sensitization ( Figure 5D and Table 2 ). This builds on the results described in our previous study looking only at the first year of life, where we found that early-life colonization with Streptococcus was a risk factor for later childhood wheeze that is exacerbated by early allergic sensitization . In the present study, we identified that in early-sensitized children, asymptomatic colonization of the upper airways by all illness-associated MPGs (Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella) increased the risk of chronic wheeze at 5 years of age, while in children who had not developed early allergic sensitization, it was associated only with transient early wheeze, which resolved by the fourth year of life. Furthermore, in early-sensitized children the frequency of asymptomatic colonization with illnessassociated MPGs was also associated with recurrence of LRIs, particularly those accompanied by fever, throughout the first four years of life (Table 1) . Notably, however, while frequency of LRI is associated with 5-year chronic wheeze Teo et al., 2015) , the effect of bacterial colonization on 5-year wheeze remained after adjusting for LRI (Table 2) . It has been suggested that the pathogenic bacterial species S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis induce local immunoinflammatory responses in the upper airways of neonates, which in the case of M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae include upregulation of a mix of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines (Folsgaard et al., 2013). However, how these immune responses differ between sensitized and non-sensitized children is incompletely understood. We have suggested, based on previous studies in this and other asthma-risk cohorts , that the increased severity of these episodes in children with allergic sensitization is due in part to interactions between infectionassociated type 1 interferon-mediated and allergy-associated Th2-mediated inflammatory pathways, which compromise their capacity to efficiently clear respiratory pathogens, thus worsening ensuing airway inflammation and resultant immunopathology. Conversely, host immune defense mechanisms in those who are non-sensitized are not compromised by these interactions, and they accordingly experience only transient illnesses. This effect may not be confined to bacterial microbiota; others have described causal relationships and synergistic interaction between allergic sensitization and viral infection, particularly rhinovirus (Jackson et al., 2012; Rubner et al., 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 603, "end": 621, "text": "(Tan et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 835, "end": 860, "text": "ARIs (Frank et al., 2010;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 861, "end": 881, "text": "Santee et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 882, "end": 898, "text": "Yi et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2746, "text": "(Bosch et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2768, "text": "Brealey et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 4256, "end": 4273, "text": "Teo et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 5660, "end": 5682, "text": "(Jackson et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 5683, "end": 5703, "text": "Rubner et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 199, "end": 215, "text": "(Figures 1 and 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 218, "end": 226, "text": "Table S2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 402, "end": 411, "text": "(Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 502, "end": 511, "text": "Figure 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1178, "text": "(Figures 2B and S3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1792, "text": "Figure 5C", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 3223, "end": 3232, "text": "Figure 5D", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 3237, "end": 3244, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 4162, "end": 4171, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 4363, "end": 4372, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, this study suggests that the microbiota of the upper airways is an important determinant of the susceptibility, frequency, and severity of ARI in early childhood.

Children were recruited between 1996 and 1998, before the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine in Western Australia in 2005. Healthy nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were collected at planned half-yearly visits (first sample from about 2 months of age, subsequently at 6 months, 1 year, and so on), in the absence of any symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) for at least 4 weeks. In addition, parents were to contact a study clinician at the onset of any ARI symptoms, at which point a study nurse visited the family within 48 hours to collect a NP sample from the child and interview the parents on the symptoms and medications used in relation to the illness. ARIs were classified as a lower respiratory illness (LRI) if accompanied by wheeze or rattly chest; or an upper respiratory illness (URI) otherwise. A total of 1943 healthy samples, 2579 URI samples, and 1056 LRI NP samples were collected and divided into aliquots that were cryofrozen for later analysis. Healthy samples that did not fulfil the criterion of >4 weeks after an illness episode were excluded. Parents kept a daily record of any medication used, from which antibiotic exposure information was extracted, and completed yearly questionnaires during face-to-face interviews. Blood samples were collected from each child at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years of age, and positive sensitization status at each timepoint was defined as serum IgE levels > 0.35 kU/L to house dust mite, cat epithelium and dander, peanut, foodmix, couch grass, rye grass, mould mix, or infant phadiatop (details of which were described in (Holt et al., 2010) ).
