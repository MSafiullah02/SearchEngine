The continued high prevalence of the disease underlines a fundamental gap in understanding of the host immune response to respiratory infection.

In vitro infection of bovine bronchial epithelial cells by bovine herpesvirus (BHV)-1 or Mannheimia haemolytica results in up-regulation of TLR2,3 a PRR generally involved in the recognition of gram-positive bacteria. In vivo infection with BHV-1 induces up-regulation of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 in the nasal mucosa, tracheal epithelium, and lung.4 A transcriptome analysis of the bronchial lymph nodes of calves singly infected with BRD pathogens revealed a global up-regulation of many PRR-associated genes, although there was some specificity in the response to particular pathogens.5 Although M haemolytica infection induced selective up-regulation of TLR1 and TLR6, infection with BHV-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) or bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) induced more pronounced up-regulation of TLR2 and TLR4.5 The biological significance of these differences is not immediately clear but warrants further investigation. In an in vitro coinfection model, exposure of alveolar type 2 epithelial cells to Histophilus somni induced activation of the type I interferon (IFN) response, which subsequently protected the cells from BRSV infection. Thus, global activation in innate immune sensors may be an important defense strategy. Other reports, however, have shown that this response may not always be beneficial. Acute stress, such as that caused by abrupt weaning and shipping, results in increased expression of TLR4, CD14, and the IFN-responsive gene 2,5-OAS by circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).6 Although this increase resulted in an enhanced capacity by the cells to respond to LPS (also known as endotoxin) stimulation, a significant positive association was found between PRR expression and risk of mortality from a subsequent BHV and M haemolytica challenge.6\n",

M haemolytica\n26\n, Mycoplasma bovis,27 and H somni\n28 cause neutrophil NET formation in vitro, and evidence of NETS has been observed in the lungs of calves infected with both M haemolytica\n26 and H somni.\n28 There is some debate as to whether NETs are an active form of host defense or simply an artifact of neutrophil cell death. In vitro, NETs can kill M haemolytica and H somni, suggesting some active role in immunity, but the relevance of this antimicrobial activity is difficult to investigate in vivo in the morbid animal. Mycoplasma bovis is not susceptible to NET-mediated killing in vitro,27 potentially due to its ability to release nucleases and degrade the extracellular DNA.29 Citrullinated histone 3, an indicator of NETs, is increased in the BAL fluid of calves with severe BRSV infection,30 and NETs have been observed microscopically in the lungs of calves with BRSV infection,31 demonstrating that NETosis is not specific to bacterial invasion. In calves with BRSV, NETs form dense networks, entrapping mucin and cells, leading to airway occlusion.31 Consistent with the idea the NETs play a pathogenic role, aerosol administration of dornase alfa, a synthetic form of DNAse I that can degrade NETS, considerably reduced airway obstruction and improved lung pathology in a small group of calves infected with BRSV.32\n",

Intranasal treatment with P multocida outer membrane protein H induced both serum IgG and secretory IgA levels that protected calves from experimental challenge with P multocida.\n49 Although studies have yet to be conducted in cattle, a recombinant outer membrane lipoprotein B from P multocida serotype A strain was shown to induce serum Ab in mice with significant bacterial killing activity.50 Regarding H somni immunity, antibodies to a 40-kDa outer membrane protein (OMP) have been found protective, whereas those to a 78-kDa OMP are not.41 Furthermore, 40-kDa OMP IgG1 antibodies protected less effectively than IgG2.

Specific Ab can be detected in nasal secretions by day 8 postinfection. Time to detection of BRSV-specific serum IgG1 and IgG2 differs, with IgG1 observed at approximately day 13, whereas IgG2 is not detected until 1 month to 3 months after infection.59 In either case, the IgG subclass responses wane rapidly. Important in protection from BRSV are nAb against F and G. Neutralizing epitopes have been defined for the prefusion and postfusion F proteins, with the most potent targeting the prefusion protein.60 In addition, the conserved central core domain of G is an important target of broadly nAb.",

Thus, stresses in calves can include those associated with weaning, veterinary procedures, transport, comingling, crowding, and dietary changes, among other factors. There is conflicting evidence in the literature on the impact of some of these factors in inducing altered serum stress markers (eg, cortisol levels) and how these may influence bacterial or viral infections or viral-bacterial coinfections associated with BRD.74 There seems to be strong evidence, however, that weaning and transportation are stressors that contribute to severity of BRD.75\n",

In cases of BRD, cattle of the same age and housed under the same conditions vary greatly in their tendency to develop disease, and the severity of the resultant clinical signs. This individual variability strongly suggests some degree of genetic control. Genetic regulation of disease susceptibility was reviewed in a recent edition of Veterinary Clinics of North America: Food Animal Practice.\n76 This section provides only a brief summary of recent findings related to BRD and the genetic component of disease susceptibility.",

Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on BTA20, identified as the ANKRA2 gene and the CD180 gene, were shown to associate with susceptibility to BRD.77\nANKRA2 plays a role in transcription of the MHC class II genes, whereas CD180 is a gene in the TLR family and is important for B-cell responsiveness to LPS. Polymorphisms have been identified in other innate bovine PRRs, including TLR, RIG-I, NOD2, and mannose-binding lectin.78 Although there currently is little evidence to directly link these SNPs to BRD susceptibility, 1 study has suggested that polymorphisms in TLR4 and TLR8 contribute to increased responsiveness to BRSV vaccination.78 In a recent study, gene set enrichment analysis identified glucose as the most important upstream regulator of BRD susceptibility in dairy cattle. In the same study, TNF was identified as the most significant upstream regulator in beef cattle, influencing 64 downstream genes that were associated with the immune response.79 Comparisons between the beef and dairy populations in this studied identified 6 BRD-associated SNPs that were shared between the groups, located in the genes ADIPOQ, HTR2A, MIF, PDE6G, PRDX3, and SNCA.\n79 All 6 genes are known to be involved in down-regulating TNF production and in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species.79 It is expected that the next decade will bring continued advancements in understanding of the genetic components of this pervasive syndrome.",

            "text": "Although vaccine development continues to be an active area of research, the past decade has seen increasing interest in strategies to influence the innate immune system. Immunology dogma has long taught that the innate immune system is nonspecific and does not improve with repeated exposure. It has become apparent, however, that, in fact, the innate immune system can be primed, or trained, by exposure to certain organisms or molecules, that results in an enhanced state of responsiveness to secondary stimuli. This enhanced state of responsiveness, termed trained immunity, is induced primarily in myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages) and NK cells86 and results in superior cytokine expression and ultimately, enhanced capacity to prevent infection. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that trained immunity is independent of adaptive immunity and is caused by epigenetic reprogramming and alterations in basal intracellular metabolic pathways, which result in changes in gene expression and cell physiology leading to increased innate immune cells\u2019 capacity to respond to stimulation.86 The idea of enhancing an animal\u2019s innate state of disease resistance is appealing, particularly during well-defined periods of stress, such as during weaning and shipping. Several recent therapies have emerged with potential to train or enhance the innate immune system during times of stress. One such DNA-based immunostimulant, marketed as the commercial product Zelnate (Bayer Animal Health, Shawnee Mission, KS, USA), has been shown to reduce lung pathology scores in cattle experimentally challenged with M haemolytica\n87 and significantly reduce mortality in high-risk cattle after feedlot placement.88\n,\n89 Although the product\u2019s exact mechanisms of action is not well defined, it may be stimulating the immune system via the innate cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway.90 Another immunomodulatory product, marketed as Amplimune (Novavive, Inc, located in Napanee, Ontario, Canada), is a mycobacterium cell wall fraction derived from the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium phlei. Amplimune nonspecifically activates the innate immune system and has been successfully applied for prevention of K99 Escherichia coli in preweaned calves. A promising study revealed, however, that Amiplimune had beneficial effects in reducing incidence and mortality associated with BRD in newly received, light-weight beef calves.91\n",
