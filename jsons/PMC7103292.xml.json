            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing phenomenon wherein double-stranded RNA (ds-RNA) triggers the degradation of a homologous messenger RNA (mRNA), and is believed to play critical roles in defense against viral attack [1]. More specifically, in an initiation step, exogenous (e.g., viral) ds-RNA is digested by the enzyme Dicer, a member of the RNase III family of ds-RNA-specific ribonucleases [2], [3], into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21\u201323 bp in length. In the effector step, the antisense strand of siRNAs is incorporated into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC then targets the mRNA complementary to the siRNA within the complex, cleaves the target mRNA, and thus lead to inhibition of mRNA translation. In mammalian cells, RNAi can be triggered by synthetic RNA duplexes that are 21\u201323 nt long [4], [5]. They guide the degradation of the cognate mRNA sequence, hence halting the corresponding protein production [4], [5]. SiRNA may be obtained by chemical synthesis or expressed from a DNA-vector [6], [7]. In the latter, a DNA insert of about 70 bp encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the gene of interest is cloned into an expression vector. When the insert-containing vector is transfected into the cell, it expresses the shRNA which is rapidly processed by the cellular machinery into a 19\u201322 nt double-stranded RNA (ds-RNA). Because RNAi confers transient interference of gene expression in a sequence-specific manner, it represents a new class of nucleic acid-based molecules likely to have significant medical utility. In fact, RNAi is viewed as one of the most important recent discovery in biology [8].",

This methodology could be exploited for therapeutic use or as a research tool in many ways. For example, the protein of interest could be a mutated human protein, as in the case of Huntington's disease (HD), which is an autosomal dominant inheritable neurodegenerative disorder currently without effective treatment, caused by an expanded polyglutamine (poly Q) tract in the corresponding protein huntingtin; suppressing the huntingtin expression in neurons in the brain is expected to delay the onset and mitigate the severity of HD [9], [10]. In other instances of RNai, the protein of interest could be foreign, as in the case of influenza infection [11] or SARS [12], where the target proteins are encoded by the viral genome. In addition, siRNAs could be used as a research tool for the elucidation of gene function [13]. Compared to expensive and time-consuming conventional gene knockdown experiments, siRNA-based gene silencing is cheaper, faster, and can be used to establish the biological function and phenotypic effects of many genes involved in both health and disease [1], [14], [15], [16].",

For example, it is exposed to many environmental pollutants including pollen, smoke, ozone, and volatile organic compounds that lead to diseases such as asthma and cancer. Furthermore, many of the lethal infectious diseases such as influenza and SARS are airborne and use lung as the target site or the main entrance to the body. Given their lethality and prevalence, lung diseases have attracted particular attention as targets of siRNA-mediated cures. In addition, since lung is accessible to therapeutic agents via multiple routes, such as nose and mouth, thus obviating the need for targeting, it has been a convenient model for the in vivo validation of siRNA-mediated therapeutic gene silencing.",

Owing to the chemical similarity between DNA and RNA, the barriers to their delivery are likely similar. Those to DNA have been extensively investigated in the context of gene therapy and may be grouped into intracellular and extracellular barriers [17], [18]. Both types of nucleic acids must cross the cell membrane and successfully escape lysosomal degradation. The negative charge and size of siRNA and plasmid DNA (typical molecular weights of some 15 kDa and 1600 kDa, respectively) imply that they cannot bind to the cell surface or cross the cell membrane by passive diffusion. However, while plasmid DNA needs to enter the nucleus to initiate transcription of the encoded genes, siRNA can function in the cytosol. Therefore, achieving therapeutic effect by the delivery of nucleic acids to non-dividing cells may be more easily achieved with siRNA than with DNA.",

In the case of i.v. delivery for example, the first major extracellular obstacle is its degradation by serum nucleases, which may be overcome by complexation with a suitable agent. Such complexation agents should also facilitate cellular uptake and endosomal escape [19]. Since charge complementarities aid complex formation, to bind negatively charged siRNA such carriers are typically positively charged. Non-viral siRNA transfection carriers can be categorized into lipid- and polycation-based ones. Lipofectamine 2000 [20], [21] and cardiolipin analogues [22], [23] have been successfully used for the delivery of siRNA. In some cases, lipid-mediated siRNA transfection is shown to be at least a thousand fold more efficient than that of naked siRNA [21]. During siRNA/DNA transfection mediated by cationic lipids, negatively charged nucleic acids and positively charged lipids spontaneously form nanoparticles (known as lipoplexes) of 50\u2013200 nm in diameter [24], [25], [26]. In the absence of serum, these particles have positive surface charges, hence favoring their interaction with cells and making them suitable for efficient siRNA delivery, although interaction with serum components may be a major factor that influence their performance when used systemically [26].",

Unfortunately, information about the biodistribution of naked or formulated siRNA and its chemically modified analogues is rather scarce [27], [28], [29]. Lipid-mediated delivery of an siRNA against apolipoprotein B (ApoB) has been used to target ApoB mRNA in the liver. Whereas administration of the Apob-specific siRNA siApoB-1, without formulation or chemical conjugation, at doses higher than 50 mg/kg was previously shown to have no in vivo silencing activity [30], \u223c 80% silencing of liver Apob mRNA and ApoB-100 protein was achieved with a single 1 mg/kg dose of lipid-formulated siApoB-1 in a non-human primate [28]. The lipid formulation in this case contained the lipids 3-N-[(\u03c9-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)2000)carbamoyl]-1,2-dimyristoyloxy-propylamine (PEG-C-DMA), 1,2-dilinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane (DLinDMA), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and cholesterol, in a 2:40:10:48 molar ratio.

            "text": "Similar to lipid-based transfection carriers, the positive charges of polycations allow an efficient interaction with siRNAs to form polyplexes which can bind onto cell plasma membrane and be endocytosed. Unlike lipoplexes that rely on the fusogenic property of the liposomes to mediate endosomal escape, polymeric carriers such as polyethylenimine (PEI) [31], [32], [33], [34] use the so-called \u201cproton sponge\u201d effect to enhance endosomal release of endocytosed polyplexes [19], [35], [36], [37]. According to this mechanism, the unprotonated amines with different pK\na values confer a buffering effect over a wide range of pH. This buffering may protect the siRNA from degradation in the endosomal compartment during the maturation of the early endosomes to late endosomes and their subsequent fusion with the lysosomes. The buffering property also allows the polycation polyethylenimine (PEI) to escape from the endosome: at lower pH, the buffering by PEI causes an influx of chloride ions and water into the endosomes, which eventually burst due to increased osmotic pressure, thus facilitating intracellular release of PEI\u2013siRNA polyplexes. High cation density of PEI (a potential positive charge per 43 Da, which is the monomer's molecular weight) also contributes to the formation of highly condensed particles by interacting with nucleic acids. However, it also results in significant cytotoxicity, particularly for large PEIs [34], [35], [38], [39].",

            "text": "As with any other nucleic acid, in the specific case of siRNA's delivery to the lung the extracellular barriers depend upon the route of administration. Introduction of the complexes to the lung could be achieved, in principle, by i.n., i.t. or systemic routes. The first two are particularly appealing since they offer a unique opportunity for the specific delivery of siRNAs to airway and alveolar epithelium. A large body of literature and experience in gene delivery to the lung supports the feasibility of this approach [40]. However, airway-directed gene delivery is not simple because the lung has evolved both physical and immunologic barriers that can hinder effective transduction of epithelial cells [40]. Besides such physical phenomena as cilia beating and mucociliary clearance, the possible interaction of the complexes with the airway surface liquid (ASL) covering the airway epithelial cells poses another major barrier [41]. The major constituents of ASL, phospholipids, proteins, and mucins (high-molecular-weight glycosylated proteins), could affect nucleic acid transfer efficiency. First, negatively charged ASL constituents could directly bind to positively charged complexes, altering their size and switching their overall charge to negative, and hence affecting their diffusion to the target cells or cellular uptake. Additionally, binding of negatively charged ASL components might displace the nucleic acid from the complexes and consequently lower their delivery efficiency. In fact, lung surfactants have been shown to impede cationic liposome-mediated DNA transfection. For example, Alveofact, a natural surfactant extracted from bovine lung lavage, inhibited gene transfer mediated by cationic liposomes in vitro\n[42]. Interestingly, polycation-mediated gene transfer was affected neither in vitro nor in vivo by the surfactant [43]. In contrast, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), collected by bronchoscopy, inhibited both liposome- and polycation-mediated gene transfer [41]. The major inhibitory effect in this case was shown to be caused by adsorption of BALF proteins to the complexes and the resultant alteration of their surface charge, and not due to the release of DNA from the complexes. In addition, in patients with diseases such as cystic fibrosis characterized by a lung pathology with thick mucus production, direct delivery into the lung via intranasal or intratracheal routes is likely to be more challenging [29], [44].",

Information on the biodistribution of the complexes of siRNA with cationic liposomes or polycations after systemic administration is rather scarce [28]. Owing to the similarities between siRNA and DNA, considering the case of the complexes of DNA would be instructive. Biodistribution of the latter is a complex process dependent on their colloidal properties, as well as interaction with blood components. For example, in experiments involving gene delivery to the liver, DNA\u2013polycation complexes of 100\u2013200 nm in diameter, unlike larger complexes, are transported into parenchymal cells. Furthermore, scavenger cells usually absorb complexes bearing strong anionic charge, resulting in elimination of the genetic material from the body. A strong positive charge on the complexes can also be deleterious. For example, following intravenous administration in mice, 60% of the dose of plasmid DNA delivered as a complex with cationic liposomes accumulated in the liver; at the same time, the level of transgene expression per microgram of DNA taken up in tissue was a 1000-fold lower in the liver than in the lung. Apparently, the decreased transgene expression in the liver is due to the rapid degradation of DNA following phagocytosis of the lipoplexes by the Kupffer cells [45].",

In the latter case, siRNA was introduced as a complex with the commercial liposomal reagent oligofectamine [11]. The following conclusions were drawn from these studies: (i) influenza virus production can be inhibited by siRNAs specific for different viral genes, especially those encoding NP, PA, and PB1; (ii) inhibitory effect of siRNA is observed in cells that were infected with the virus prior to the introduction of siRNA; (iii) siRNAs that inhibited influenza viral production in cultured cells also inhibited viral production in chicken embryos; and (iv) while M-siRNA specifically inhibited the accumulation of M-mRNA, siRNA specific for NP and PA abolished the accumulation not only of the corresponding mRNA, but also of vRNA and cRNA, suggesting a critical role of NP and PA proteins in viral transcription and replication. Both the targeted mRNA degradation and the resulting global inhibition of viral RNA transcription make the NP- and PA-specific siRNAs especially potent inhibitors of influenza viral infection.",

As a model, we first tested the ability of jetPEI (a proprietary linear PEI formulation from Polyplus-Transfection, Illkrich, France) to deliver the Luc (luciferase) gene into the lungs of mice and also the efficacy of jetPEI/Luc siRNA complex to inhibit the expression of Luc in the lungs [47]. Consistent with previous findings [44], [46], when jetPEI/DNA complexes were injected i.v. through the retro-orbital vein Luc activity was highest in the lungs where it could be detected for at least 4 days; in heart, liver, spleen and kidney, Luc activity was 100\u20131000 times lower (depending upon the PEI/DNA ratio) and detectable for shorter periods after injection. When jetPEI/DNA complexes were administered i.t., the luciferase expression in the lungs was about 25-fold lower. Luc-siRNA/jet PEI complexes delivered i.v. resulted in a 17-fold suppression of the expression of the Luc gene delivered i.t. in complex with jetPEI. GFP-siRNA/jetPEI (GFP = green fluorescent protein) complexes had no effect on the expression of Luc. Since Luc-siRNA can inhibit the Luc expression only in those lung cells that were transfected with the Luc-DNA, these results indicate that jetPEI delivers siRNA effectively into the lung cells of mice, and hence delivery of appropriate siRNA/jetPEI complexes may be used to inhibit influenza infection in the lung. The reason for the relatively higher delivery of the complexes of DNA and siRNA with PEI is not clear but may be because the lung (i) contains the first capillary bed traversed by i.v.-injected materials or (ii) is among the most vascularized tissues in the body. We also noticed that the relative expression in the lung compared to other organs was higher when the surface charge of the complexes is cationic (positive zeta potential).",

When complexes of NP- and PA-siRNAs (60 \u03bcg each) with jetPEI were injected together, even greater, some 100-fold, reduction in virus titer was observed. Although a 10-fold effect may seem modest, lung virus titer reductions of this magnitude usually accompany survival of lethal challenge in vaccine development studies. This is particularly significant considering that a challenge dose of the virus used (12,000 pfu) was far greater than those likely encountered upon natural exposure of humans to influenza virus. Significant reduction of virus titer was observed even when the siRNA complex was administered 12 h before infection, or when the lungs were analyzed 2 days after infection [47].

The cost of jetPEI from the vendor is about $600 for 0.1 ml of a 300-mM solution. Thus for a human with a 50-kg body weight (i.e., 2500 times above that of a mouse), the amount of jetPEI required for a single injection of siRNA would cost tens of thousands of dollars. A far cheaper linear PEI ($25/g) of a similar molecular weight available from another commercial vendor (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) exhibited markedly lower efficiency and specificity compared to jetPEI. This difference appeared intriguing, and therefore we decided to investigate the mechanism involved in detail. NMR analysis indicated some 11% residual acyl groups in the commercial linear 25-kDa PEI. We found that removal of these residual N-acyl moieties from the commercial polymer by simple acid hydrolysis at elevated temperature enhanced its plasmid DNA delivery efficiency 21 times in vitro and as much as 10,000 times in mice with a concomitant 1500-fold enhancement in lung specificity. These observations indicated that hydrolytic purity of PEI was important for both transfection efficiency and specificity. To confirm this hypothesis and to reduce the costs still further, three additional linear PEIs of 22-, 87-, and 217-kDa molecular weights were synthesized ab initio by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of 50-, 200-, and 500-kDa poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)s (under $0.5/g, Polysciences or Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, yielding the pure polycations isolated as their hydrochloride salts. PEI87 and PEI217 exhibited the highest transfection efficiency in vitro \u2013 115-fold and 6-fold above those of the commercial and deacylated PEI25s, respectively; moreover, PEI87 delivered DNA to the mouse lung as efficiently as the pure PEI25 but at a lower concentration and, importantly, with a 200-fold lung specificity.",

Although the difference in the number of protonatable nitrogens between the fully deacylated PEI25 and its commercial counterpart is only 11%, it can have a profound effect on the polycation's behavior, as illustrated by the following calculation. Given the 43-Da molecular weight of the \u2013CH2CH2NH\u2013 monomeric unit, the average number of the monomers in PEI25 is 581; this number is also the length of the contiguous stretch of potentially protonatable nitrogens. Assuming a random distribution of the N-propionyl moieties in the commercial PEI25, its contiguous stretch of protonatable nitrogens is only 11. This 64-fold difference may substantially affect the stability of the polyplexes as they traverse through the various extracellular and intracellular barriers involved in systemic gene delivery. Systemic delivery in mice of the complexes of a siRNA against a model gene, firefly luciferase, and PEI25 and PEI87 afforded a 77% and 93%, respectively, suppression of the gene expression in the lungs. Furthermore, a polyplex of NP-siRNA and PEI87 resulted in some 94% drop of virus titers in the lungs of influenza-infected animals [34].",

Because bovine and human RSV NS1 seem to antagonize the type-1 IFN-mediated antiviral response [60], [61] the authors reasoned that blocking NS gene expression might attenuate RSV replication and provide an effective antiviral and immune enhancement therapy against RSV. Thus, siRNA oligonucleotide sequences for RSV NS1, and siNS1 were cloned into the pSMWZ-1 vector [62]. Pre-transfection (complexed with the liposomal reagent Lipofectamine 2000) of A549 cells with siNS1 substantially reduced the expression of NS1 proteins, but not of other viral proteins, at 24 h after infection with a recombinant RSV expressing GFP (rgRSV). The level of expression of IFN-inducible genes in infected A549 cells treated with siNS1 was considerably altered, as shown by microarray data. Whereas A549 cells showed considerable siNS1-induced decreases in rgRSV-infected cell numbers and virus titers, no effect of siNS1 in Vero cells (type-1 IFN-deficient) was observed. Also, in parallel studies, Vero cells cotransfected with pEGFP and siEGFP, not siNS1, showed substantial knockdown (91.68%) of EGFP gene expression. These results showed a definitive role of siNS1 in the attenuation of RSV replication and implicate the type-1 IFN pathway in this process.",

In addition, the viral titer in supernatants of homogenized lungs was also significantly decreased in the siNS1-treated mice compared to controls. Mice treated with siNS1 displayed significantly lower airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) than untreated mice, as well as a considerable reduction in pulmonary inflammation, as evidenced by decreases in the goblet cell hyperplasia of the bronchi and in the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells in the interstitial regions compared to controls. Knockdown of the RSV NS1 gene significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 expression in the lung compared to controls. Examination of IFN-\u03b3 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by ELISA revealed a 2-fold rise in concentration in siNS1-treated mice compared to control animals. Nano-siNS1 treatment also had a prophylactic effect. Mice were treated with the Nano-siNS1 2, 4 or 7 days before viral inoculation. Analysis of viral titers 5 days after infection showed that the prophylactic effect of siNS1 can last for at least 4 days. To test whether prophylactic blocking of NS1 activity can induce anti-RSV immunity and provide protection from re-infection, mice were administered with the Nano-siNS1, inoculated with RSV (5 \u00d7 106 pfu/mouse) 2 days later, and then re-inoculated with RSV (1 \u00d7 107 pfu/mouse) after 16 days. Cellular immunity induced by RSV 5 days after infection was examined in these mice by intracellular cytokine staining of splenocytes for IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4. Splenocytes of mice treated with Nano-siNS1 showed an increase in IFN-\u03b3 production in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and also in IL-4 production in CD4+ T cells compared with controls. Following secondary infection mice treated with Nano-siNS1 showed over a 1000-fold drop in the viral titers compared to control mice.

[69] extended their studies into a Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) model. siRNAs showing prominent prophylactic and therapeutic activity in cell culture, referred to as siSC2 and siSC5 (selected from 48 siRNA duplexes targeting the entire SCV genome), were evaluated in vivo, using initially a reporter gene assay in mice and subsequently a clinically acceptable intranasal administration in the recently established Rhesus macaque SARS model. The two siRNA duplexes, siSC2 and siSC5, target the SCV genome at spike protein-coding and ORF1b (NSP12) regions, respectively. Their targeted sequences are identical to strain TOR-2 used in the cell-culture study, to strain PUMC01 used in the macaque model, and to another 100 published SCV strains isolated during different phases of SCV evolution recently defined with wide geographic distributions around the world. Moreover, these are the two most potent inhibitors for reducing SCV replication in FRhK-4 cells among a set of active siRNA duplexes. A synergistic anti-SCV activity was observed when a combination of siSC2 and siSC5 was applied in the cell-culture study showing the strongest prophylactic and therapeutic effects.",

The siRNAs were delivered intratracheally in 5% aqueous glucose or in INFASURF (Forest Laboratories, Inc., New York, NY). (INFASURF is a prescription pharmaceutical that is instilled into the lungs of newborn infants with, or at risk for, respiratory failure. It is a sterile, organic solvent extract of calf lung lavage, containing surfactant proteins B and C (SP-B and C), with a protein-B level closest to that of natural surfactant.) The siRNAs were co-delivered with pCI-scLuc plasmid. The pCI-scLuc plasmid contained corresponding siSC2 and siSC5-targeted DNA sequence between its cytomegalovirus promoter-driven transcriptional initiation site and luciferase encoding sequence. This setup allowed easy monitoring of delivery efficiency from Luc assay. Interestingly, co-delivery in 5% glucose resulted in a higher level of reporter gene expression and stronger RNAi effect than that delivered in the INFASURF solution. Hence the former (i.e., naked siRNA) was employed in 5% glucose for experiments in Rhesus macaque. With siRNAs instilled intranasally, observations of SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence, and lung histopathology and immunohistochemistry consistently showed siRNA-mediated anti-SARS efficacy by either prophylactic or therapeutic regimens. The siRNAs used provided relief from SCV infection-induced fever, diminished SCV viral levels, and reduced acute diffuse alveoli damage. The 10\u201340 mg/kg accumulated dosages of siRNA showed no sign of siRNA-induced toxicity.",

Both trials were double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized. In total, 101 human subjects were enrolled in the trials and 65 were exposed to ALN-RSV01. The subjects received a single or multiple daily doses of ALN RSV01, or a saline placebo, as a nasal spray. ALN RSV01 was found to be safe when administered in relevant doses, with a mild adverse event profile comparable to placebo's. There was no evidence of laboratory or electrocardiographic abnormalities in subjects exposed to the drug and, no significant systemic exposure to the ALN RSV01 that was administered intranasally. Nastech, a Seattle-based biotechnology company (http://www.nastech.com), is currently developing siRNA as influenza therapeutics. By targeting the conserved regions of the influenza viral genome, their siRNAs is expected to be effective against all known human and avian influenza strains. Alnylam also is developing RNAi therapeutics for pandemic flu, such as H5N1 [70].",
