We analyzed more than 12 million COVID-19 related posts on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media platform in China, from November 20, 2019 to March 3, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify \"sick posts,\" which are reports of one's own and other people's symptoms and diagnosis related to COVID-19. We then modeled the predictive power of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts, up to seven days ahead of official statistics. But other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For a subset of geotagged posts (2.85% of all retrieved posts), we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China, regardless of unequal distribution of healthcare resources and outbreak timeline. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. On top of monitoring overall search and posting activities, it is crucial to sift through the contents and efficiently identify true signals from noise.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The unprecedented magnitude and transmission speed of COVID-19 also brought about massive social media activities as people isolate in their homes to break the infection chains. 11 Massive social media data inevitably contain massive noise (e.g., public reactions and awareness of the disease), which can be counterproductive for disease forecasting. 5 It is therefore critical to identify reliable signals (e.g., sick posts reporting symptoms and diagnosis) to predict infection cases and inform a rapid response. 12 Here we present an effort to collect and analyze COVID-19 related posts on the most popular public social media site in China, Weibo. To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines a large and fine-grained dataset of 12 million social media posts to predict COVID-19 case counts in China from November 20, 2019 to March 3, 2020. With much increased data granularity, we developed a supervised machine-learning classifier to distinguish \"sick posts,\" which are reports of own and others' selfand other-reports of symptoms and diagnosis, from other COVID-19 related posts that could dilute disease signals from the data stream. Using the officially reported case accounts as the outcome, we compared the predictive power of sick posts versus other COVID-19 posts. We show evidence that sick posts predict China CDC's daily case counts up to seven days in advance, while other COVID-19 related posts do not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China.",

Keywords-based advanced search of Weibo posts is allowed via its web interface; however, the output of such searches is limited to 50 pages (or around 500 posts) as per Weibo policy, making large-scale public data access notoriously difficult. To bypass these limitations, we retrieved posts from a user pool maintained by our research team (see SI section A).

This binary variable controls for the exogenous pulse of case counts. 17 Difference scores are used because the Dickey-Fuller test (including 10 lagged differences) suggests the new case counts are non-stationary (p = .413), so are the sick post counts (p = .527), both violating the assumption of testing Granger causality using linear models. Dickey-Fuller tests suggest the difference scores restore the stationarity of new case counts (p = .025) and daily sick post counts (p = .008). These difference scores can be interpreted as \"daily-additional\" new cases and sick posts on top of the counts from the previous day.",

Daily counts of Weibo posts and new cases over time are illustrated in Figure 3 . We estimated the aforementioned linear model with 10 lagged terms for both the new case counts and sick post counts. Figure 4 (A) summarizes estimates of the sick post counts' Granger causality on daily case counts (see SI Table S3 ). Particularly, one unit increase in the normalized sick post counts (i.e., 1 sick post per 10-million posts) predicted 1.252 (95% CI: 0.308, 2.196) to 3.885 (95% CI: 2.227, 5.543) daily-additional new cases 1 to 7 days in the future. To corroborate the above results, we performed additional analyses. First, we tested the relationship between new case counts and other COVID-19 post counts (normalized), using the same linear model. Figure 4 (A) further illustrates the estimates such that other COVID-19 post counts had limited predictive power on future new case counts. Their effect size (\u03b7 2 = .224) was also smaller than that of the sick post counts based on the aforementioned model (\u03b7 2 = .614, see SI Table S4 ). It means that Weibo posts that discuss some aspect of COVID-19, but did not report anyone's symptoms or diagnosis, could only predict future case counts to a very limited degree.",

The estimated coefficients of these effects were much larger than those at the national level, although they explained less variance of the case counts. This is plausible since these geo-tagged posts were only a small fraction of all sick posts.

It poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems worldwide, because screening and diagnostic tests have to be developed from scratch. Even when such tests eventually become available, testing capacity is often severely limited, fueling the outbreak as many patients unknowingly infect others. Based on more than 12 million COVID-19-related Weibo posts between November 20, 2019 and March 3, 2020, we developed a supervised machine learning classifier to identify \"sick posts,\" which are reports of one's own and other people's symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19. Using the officially reported daily case counts as the outcome, our work shows that sick posts significantly predict daily case counts, up to seven days ahead of official statistics. This finding confirms prior research that social media data can be usefully applied to nowcast and forecast emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. 18, 19 Our finding that other COVID-19 posts do not have similar predictive power as that of sick posts shows that not all social media data are equally informative. Specifically, COVID-19 has dramatically disrupted everyday life, resulting in people sheltering in place and increasingly communicating with others via social media. As shown in our dataset, the majority of COVID-19 chatter on Weibo was due to public awareness of COVID-19, rather than actual symptom reports. When facing a deluge of social media activities as a result of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the primary challenge in using social media for disease surveillance is to identify valid signals from noise. 12, [19] [20] [21] Most previous work took rather coarse-grained approaches, relying primarily on keyword searches. Our work demonstrates one viable way to identify the signal through reports of symptoms and diagnosis, bringing significant contributions to the literature on digital surveillance.",

Being the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei province experienced extreme testing shortage during the early stage of the study period. As a result, many Hubei residents turned to social media sites such as Weibo to seek help for testing and medical care. By contrast, social media help-seeking activities were uncommon in other parts of China where testing and healthcare resources were much more adequate. With such regional variations, we still observe strong signals of sick posts' prediction on case counts, suggesting the predictive power of sick posts was robust against testing delays. Further, the variations in effect sizes show that social media data's predictive power may vary across different geographic areas, with different levels of preparedness, and at different stages of the outbreak. Future studies based on longer periods of data monitoring could explore in more depth the temporal and spatial variations of COVID-19 social media surveillance efficacy.",
