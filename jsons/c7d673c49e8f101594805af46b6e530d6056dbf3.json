This worksheet focused on response outside of the traditional EMS system, levels 2, 3, and 4. The key study is the PAD trial (LOE 1), which demonstrated that twice as many cardiac arrest patients survived when PAD was available (93% CI 1.07-3.77) (Hallstrom, Ornato et al. 2004 pg 637) and that PAD programs were generally safe for both the patient and the rescuer. (Peberdy, Ottingham et al. 2006 pg59) . PAD is also supported by four LOE2 studies, one LOE3, and 7 LOE4 studies. There is a single case study that illustrates an inappropriate shock being advised by an AED device, which is considered a negative study.( Nanthakumar 2006 pge672) However, this single negative case is far outweighed by the numerous positive studies with much larger sample sizes.",

A study found that attrition of volunteer responders was 36% and that some locations do not have a ready pool of volunteer responders. (Richardson, Gunnels et al. 2005 pg688) Further, a large percent of lay-volunteers associated with a formal PAD program may not participate in retraining efforts, but the retention of CPR skills among lay volunteers may be high. (Riegel, Nafziger et al. 2006 pg254) (Cummins, Schubach et al. 1989pg143 ) (Christenson, Nafziger et al. 2007 pg52) But during an actual cardiac arrest event the number of CPR actions that are actually preformed by lay responders may be low. (Hedges, Sehra et al. 2006 pg659) The cost effectiveness of placing an AED in a given location must also be considered. Research has shown that they are cost-effective when placed on commercial airplanes (Groeneveld, Kwong et al. 2001pg1482) or other high incidence areas (Nichol, Hallstrom et al. 1998 pg15); Nichol 2003 pg697) ; (Cram, Vijan et al. 2003pg745 ); (Gold and Eisenberg 2007 pg1); (Folke, Lippert et al. 2009 pg510) ; but they may not be cost effective in low incidence areas. (Pell, Walker et al. 2007 pg5) Several studies have looked at the location of cardiac arrests to try to predict high incidence locations. (Becker, Eisenberg et al. 1998 ; (Engdahl and Herlitz 2005 pg171); (Friedman, Dowler et al. 2006 pg407) ; (Muraoka, Ohishi et al. 2006 pg827) Prior to initiating a PAD program it is recommended that the likely incidence of cardiac arrest in that location be determined.",
