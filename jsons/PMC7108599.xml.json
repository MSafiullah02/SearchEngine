            "text": "Progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease with prominent vascular damage and multi-organ fibrosis (1). Several auto-antibodies present in the sera of patients with SSc, including anti-endothelial cells (2) and anti-fibroblasts (3\u20135) antibodies, may directly contribute to disease pathogenesis. The identification of pathogenetically relevant auto-antigens is a major goal in autoimmune disorders such as SSc. We have previously identified a tetraspanin transmembrane 4 superfamily member 7 (TM4SF7 or NAG-2) peptide epitope (CGVLGVGIWLAA) as a key autoantigen target of IgG auto-antibodies in SSc (6). NAG-2 is a tetraspanin belonging to the transmembrane 4 superfamily that forms complexes with the integrins alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1; it is highly expressed on endothelial cells and on fibroblasts and seems to have a role in cell mobility and adhesion (7). The NAG-2 peptide shares a high degree of homology with the Cytomegalovirus (hCMV)-derived protein UL94. Different infectious agents are believed to play a role in the immunopathogenesis of SSc (8\u201310). We provided direct evidence for a molecular mimicry mechanism by which antibodies against a hCMV-derived protein can be linked to endothelial cell damage and fibrosis in patients with SSc (6, 11). Indeed, affinity-purified anti-UL94 IgG antibodies derived from SSc patients\u2019 sera recognize NAG-2 in a whole-cell lysate and induce apoptosis of endothelial cells upon engagement of the NAG-2\u2013integrin complex (6). The same antibodies are also able to cause fibroblast activation and proliferation and to induce modulation of genes involved in cell apoptosis and activation (11). Therefore, we proposed that hCMV is linked to the pathogenesis of SSc through a particular subset of anti-hCMV antibodies that specifically interacts with the normally expressed cell surface receptor NAG-2 sharing similarity with the UL94 viral protein.",

To this aim, we took advantage from a recently published procedure that allows to dissect the memory B-cell repertoire and to isolate with high-efficiency B-cell clones producing antigen-specific mAbs (12, 13). This method has been successfully used in the generation of neutralizing antibodies directed against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (12). We reasoned that in autoimmunity, the B-cell response directed against a pathogenetically relevant autoantigen epitope may comprise heterogeneous subsets of auto-antibodies with different functional properties. Therefore, our aim was to isolate a human mAb able to bind NAG-2 but functionally inactive, from SSc patients. The pool of IgG memory B cells was isolated by negative selection through fluorescence cell sorting from three patients with SSc. IgG + B cells were immortalized with EBV at low number of cells per well, in the presence of TLR9 agonist, CpG oligonucleotides 2006 and irradiated mononuclear cells.",

We describe here the generation of the human mAb JB007 derived from a SSc patient, which specifically binds the NAG-2 molecule on endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Such antibody is functionally inactive since it does not induce endothelial damage and fibroblast proliferation indicating that in the autoreactive B-cell repertoire directed against a particular autoantigen, auto-antibodies with different functional activity are present.",

Indeed, only a few cases have been treated with anti-TNF-alpha and anti-CD20 agents, giving conflicting results (21\u201323). The only biological therapy specifically designed for SSc is a mAb directed against the transforming growth factor-beta, a profibrotic cytokine thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the multi-organ fibrosis typical of scleroderma. Unfortunately, such therapy seems to have no efficacy in the treatment of the disease (24).",
