Examining the external factors influencing the efficiency of the hotel industry is crucial in terms of advancing hotel performance and improving the quality of destination accommodation products (Yang and Cai, 2016). Previous studies have suggested a few external factors such as accessibility, regional economic context, crisis events and trade openness impact hotel efficiency (Assaf and Cvelbar, 2015; Huang et al., 2012; Yang and Cai, 2016). As an essential component of a destination\u2019s tourism product, the efficiency of the hotel industry is inevitably influenced by the overall development level of tourism at the destination. However, the influence of the destination\u2019s tourism level as an external factor on hotel industry efficiency has not yet been examined.",

With the continuous expansion of the tourism industry and the growing competition in the hotel industry in most destinations, it is impossible for hotels to run their businesses without considering the level of market competition. Therefore, this study also includes market competition as an external factor that impacts a destination\u2019s hotel industry efficiency. The main objective is to examine whether and how the level of tourism specialization and market competition jointly impact hotel industry efficiency using the stochastic frontier approach. This research is conducted in China, where the hotel industry has been developing for over four decades and is currently witnessing a diversifying supply under a booming tourism industry.",

In 2016, the Chinese government initiated the all-for-one tourism development policy (\u201cQuan yu lv you\u201d in Chinese), which aims at boosting tourism production at the destination level. In recent years, many provinces in China have encouraged the building of high-end and luxury hotels, expecting that greater investment will boost the industry and allow it to reap higher profits (Wu and Yang, 2018). According to the former China National Tourism Administration (CNTA, now Ministry of Culture and Tourism), the number of four- and five-star hotels has increased rapidly, from a combined total of 1671 in 2006\u20133170 in 2017. The intense construction of high-end hotels, however, has not resulted in rapid profit gains. Since 2013, China\u2019s hotel industry has been experiencing challenges partially due to the anti-corruption policy launched by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of China in late 2012. Consequently, the revenue per available room (RevPAR) decreased by 24.9 % from 2012 to 2015, and the occupancy rate dropped from 58.2 % in 2012 to 52.3 % in 2015.",

In practical terms, understanding the determinants of hotel industry efficiency is important for identifying possible solutions to the problems experienced by industry practitioners (Yang et al., 2017). Numerous studies have been conducted on the internal determinants that influence the efficiency of the hotel industry; however, the influences in the external environment that are closely linked to the destinations\u2019 tourism development levels have yet to be adequately examined. With the background of rapid tourism development and fierce competition, the theoretical linkages between external factors and hotel industry efficiency should be consolidated. Many scholars have found that the number of tourists has a positive impact on the efficiency of hotel performance (Assaf et al., 2017). Higher numbers of tourists often reflect higher tourism specialization, which could be measured by the ratio of the number of tourists to residents in a region or the ratio of the total tourism revenue to regional GDP. Regions that are more specialized in tourism should have greater hotel industry efficiency. Thus, the complex effects of tourism specialization and market competition on the efficiency of the hotel industry merit fuller investigation.",

For example, Arbelo-P\u00e9rez et al. (2017) use a stochastic frontier model with a trans-log cost (profit) function to evaluate the cost (profit) efficiency of 838 hotels in Spain in the period 2009\u20132013 and focus on analyzing the impact of output quality on estimations of hotel efficiency. Compared with the DEA method, SFA assumes an explicit model for the underlying production relationship and allows for inefficiencies and random errors. SFA models also allow deviations from the production frontier to be attributed to both technical inefficiency and measurement error (Barros, 2004; Oliveira et al., 2013b). SFA can also be used to make statistical inferences for further analysis of hotel industry efficiency and the associated predictors. Thus, SFA is more appropriate than DEA in terms of model assumptions and determinant analysis.",

Thus, from a nonlinear view, the manner in which tourism specialization influences hotel efficiency is unclear because its impact on hotel efficiency may change over time, given stages in the development of tourism in which market competition level varies accordingly.

By investigating aggregate hotel performance data for domestic and foreign-invested hotels in each Chinese province during the 2001\u20132012 period, Mao and Yang (2016) analyze FDI spillovers and explain the role of their moderating effects in the Chinese hotel industry. Using panel data of the hotel industry in 31 Chinese provincial regions from 2005 to 2013, Yang et al. (2017) employ the DEA method to show that different regions have different efficiency performance in the various hotel market segments.

There is a trend to examine the impact of external factors on hotel industry efficiency. However, researchers have investigated these factors independently and ignored their joint effects. Moreover, there have been diverse methodologies in the studies of this field such as the adoption of SFA models. In the current context of rapid tourism development and the fierce competition within the hotel industry of many destinations, there is an urgent need to connect the hotel industry efficiency with the destination\u2019s tourism development characteristics. Levels of the hotel market competition and tourism specialization of a destination are strong representatives of the external factors that closely connect the hotel industry with the destination\u2019s tourism context. More importantly, the influences of these external factors on hotel industry efficiency may be dynamic and synergetic thus should be further examined. This research adopts the SFA method to examine the effects of tourism specialization and market competition on hotel industry efficiency. In the following section, we develop hypotheses for empirical examination based on the existing literature and our research objectives.",

From the perspective of direct impact, tourism specialization associated with tourism growth can immediately strengthen the development of the hotel industry by increasing the hotel occupancy rate and hence improving operating efficiency. This means that higher tourism specialization within the tourism destination generates a greater flow of tourists and an ongoing expansion of the hospitality market, which in turn ensures a higher demand for the accommodation provided by hotels and, therefore, higher revenues and profits. Accordingly, in tourism destinations with high tourism specialization, a high demand for lodging from the large number of tourists is likely to boost the efficiency of the hotel industry.",

Inevitably, these destinations will have a highly competitive environment, and the associated rising market competition could lead to a loss in hotel market share, which in turn has a negative impact on industry efficiency. Moreover, several studies confirm that tourism specialization may ultimately have a negative impact on the economic growth of tourism destinations through a crowding-out effect when tourism expands beyond a certain level (Pham et al., 2015). Thus, tourism development represented by the level of tourism specialization at a destination does not guarantee high efficiency in the hotel industry. In general, we assume that tourism specialization has a nonlinear influence on hotel efficiency. Hence, hypotheses 1 and 2 can be expressed as follows:H1Tourism specialization has a nonlinear effect on the efficiency of the hotel industry;\nH2Tourism specialization has a negative influence on hotel efficiency when it exceeds a certain threshold level.\n",

Intuitively, we expect high-efficiency scores for the hotel industry, since hotels are operating in a highly competitive environment with relatively low entry and high exit barriers (Singal, 2015).",

            "text": "Despite most research favoring a positive relationship as a commonly accepted view, several empirical studies on this issue find strong evidence supporting a negative link between market competition and hotel efficiency (Assaf et al., 2017). Intensified market competition reflected by a higher number of hotels offering a similar product implies lower average room rates (Abrate et al., 2012; Becerra et al., 2013). The contradictory opinion on such issues leads us to a bold hypothesis that the effect of market competition on hotel industry efficiency could be moderated by tourism specialization. Tourism destinations with growing tourism specialization are more likely to attract nonstandard accommodation firms, such as guesthouses and shared accommodations, as these firms prefer engaging in a more mature destination with a prosperous tourism industry (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2017). In short, we assume that whether market competition imposes a positive or negative effect on the efficiency of hotels depends on the level of tourism specialization. Hence, we hypothesize the following:H3Market competition has a nonlinear effect on the efficiency of the hotel industry;\nH4The impact of market competition on hotel industry efficiency is moderated by tourism specialization.\n",

The consequence is that there is an oversupply of hotel rooms in some big cities because more upscale hotels were built by local real-estate developers on low-cost land without serious consideration of the actual market demand (Law et al., 2014). This perspective facilitates understanding the reasons for the oversupply of high-end hotels and the resulting adverse effects (Yang et al., 2017). The extensive growth of capital has become an obstacle to the improvement of management efficiency in hotels, and as the sign of the coefficient \u03b28 of variable T \u00d7 lnK indicates, over time, the growth of fixed asset investment continues to amplify the inhibiting effect. Although the marginal benefit of labor involved in hotels also decreases, this may be due to the oversupply of trained employees, which in turn decreased hotel industry performance (Yang and Cai, 2016); however, the coefficients \u03b25, \u03b27 and \u03b29 related to labor are not significant.",

This is an interesting finding that seems to be contrary to popular belief that the hotel industry should benefit more from a destination with higher tourism specialization, since we usually conclude that a prosperous tourism industry with many tourists can produce a large potential accommodation market for the hotel industry and thereby boost its efficiency. However, a notable fact cannot be ignored: the rise of nonstandard accommodation suppliers is not only changing the competitive landscape in the hotel industry but also transforming the tourism industry (Heo et al., 2019). Classic economic theories of demand and supply indicate that increased supply may hurt firm performance by depressing price to a new and lower equilibrium (Assaf et al., 2017). The rapidly emerging sharing economy in recent years means that accommodation sharing (e.g., Airbnb) is growing quickly and becoming an important market force that is challenging the hotel industry (Xie and Kwok, 2017) and continuing to negatively affect hotel performance (Zervas et al., 2015).",

We explain that some nonmarket factors, such as the level of government consumption due to corruption, play an important role in the development of star-rated hotels in China. However, the anti-corruption movement has cut off the hotel revenue attached to administrative expenses and disrupted the political connections between star-rated hotels and government officials. Hence, the main channel driving the total revenue of star hotels has been abruptly blocked, with the consequence of lower efficiency (Zhang and Shu, 2018).",

The hotel industry in a province with higher transportation accessibility (TA) seems more likely to be technically efficient. The finding of a positive influence of transportation accessibility is consistent with Assaf and Cvelbar (2015), who found that the quality of the transport infrastructure has a significant positive impact on hotel performance.

The results show that the effect of both tourism specialization and market competition on the efficiency of the hotel industry is not mutually independent or monotonically linear. The results revealed that provincial tourism specialization and market competition exert a synergistic effect on hotel industry efficiency. As the level of tourism specialization increases, the efficiency of the hotel industry experiences progress in an inverted u-shape, and the marginal benefit of tourism specialization growth decreases as market competition becomes more intense. The influence of market competition on the operating efficiency of the hotel industry depends on the level of tourism specialization. Only when tourism specialization is below a certain threshold value does market competition generate a positive effect on hotel industry efficiency.
