Hypertension occurs in millions of people worldwide, the large majority of whom are unaware of their condition; a recent report indicated that prevalence rates are even higher than previously suspected, at 28% in North America and 44% in Europe10. Many long-term studies were required before the increased morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension became accepted and it was classified as a disease in need of treatment9. The underlying cause of hypertension in most cases was, and still is, unknown. Therapy was initially directed at reducing blood volume by the use of DIURETICS, SYMPATHETIC TONE by the use of adrenergic-blocking agents, or VASCULAR RESISTANCE by the use of vasodilators.",

It is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that catalyses the hydrolytic cleavage of dipeptides from the carboxyl terminus of a wide variety of oligopeptides in vitro. Its best known function is the in vivo conversion of Ang I (DRVYIHPFHL), which circulates in plasma, into the potent vasopressor Ang II by removal of the C-terminal His\u2013Leu (Fig. 1). Ang I is generated primarily by the renin-catalysed hydrolysis of the Leu10\u2013Val11 peptide bond of angiotensinogen, a liver-derived 55-kDa plasma protein. ACE also affects blood pressure by cleaving bradykinin (BK, RPPGFSPFR), thereby abolishing its vasodilating activity (because of this, ACE is sometimes referred to as kininase II (kininase I is carboxypeptidase N)). BK is generated from a kininogen precursor by the action of plasma kallikrein (a serine proteinase) in a process analogous to that of Ang I formation (Fig. 1).",

A sequence of 22 hydrophobic amino acids located near the carboxyl terminus of the protein serves as a transmembrane domain that anchors ACE to the cell surface. This creates a 28-residue cytosolic domain and a 1,227-residue glycosylated extracellular domain. Its cellular orientation defines ACE as a type I transmembrane ectoprotein and, in the case of endothelial cells, positions it optimally for interaction with its circulating substrates. The amino acid sequence of human endothelial ACE provides clear evidence for a gene duplication event in its evolutionary history. It consists of an N-terminal domain of about 612 amino acids, a 15-residue interdomain sequence and a 650-residue C-terminal domain.

The active site, identified by the catalytic Zn2+ ion bound to the HEXXH sequence (and to lisinopril in its complex with the enzyme), is located in the deep cavity, some 10 \u00c5 from its entrance. The amino-terminal helices (\u03b11\u20133) form a lid-like extension that partially covers the active-site channel, which limits the access of substrates and inhibitors. In fact, the aperture of the channel opening is approximately 3 \u00c5 in diameter, which is too small for most peptide substrates, indicating that tACE must undergo some conformational change, possibly associated with its unique chloride ion activation, for the substrate to enter the channel. From the structure of the lisinopril\u2013tACE complex (Fig. 4) it is evident that the phenyl ring of the inhibitor interacts with the S1 sub-site in the active site, the lysine with the S1\u2032 sub-site, and the proline occupies the S2\u2032 sub-site. The carboxyl group, located between the phenylpropyl group and the lysine, binds to the Zn2+ in the active site and also forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain carboxylate of Glu384. Other key interactions occur between the side-chain amino group of the inhibitor lysine and Glu162 of tACE, and between the C-terminal proline carboxyl group with Lys511 and Tyr520. The binding of the inhibitor to the S1, S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 pockets and its zinc coordination form the basis for the structure-guided design of improved domain-selective ACE inhibitors. In addition, two buried chloride ions that are important for the activation of the enzyme were identified in the crystal structure (outside the active site), both distant (20.7 \u00c5 and 10.4 \u00c5, respectively) from the catalytic Zn2+ ion. The first is bound to Arg186, Arg489 and Trp485, whereas the second is bound to Arg522 and Tyr224. The structure is indicative of an indirect mechanism for chloride activation, possibly through effects on active-site structure. This study also revealed that the structure of tACE (MA sub-clan of M clan of peptidases (M clan peptidases are metalloenzymes and the metal is involved in catalysis)) resembles that of rat neurolysin41 and a newly identified carboxypeptidase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus42 \u2014 both of which are members of the MA clan \u2014 despite low sequence similarity.",

First, notable differences in hydrophobicity and charge are observed in the lid-like structure comprising helices \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 (using tACE nomenclature; Fig. 2). This part of the structure seems to affect the substrate specificity of the N- or C-domain, as tACE mutants which had this region replaced by the corresponding N-domain sequence showed a preference for N-domain substrates43 (Z. L. Woodman et al., unpublished data). Second, the Zn2+-binding site with the canonical HEXXH motif is conserved. Third, it has been shown that the C-domain has greater chloride dependence than the N-domain, both in terms of substrate hydrolysis and inhibitor binding19,24. From the model we can predict that Arg186 (a key residue for binding one of the two chloride ions in tACE) is replaced by His164 in the N-domain. So, in the N-domain only one chloride-ion-binding pocket is plausible, involving Arg500 and Tyr202. Fourth, positioning of the lisinopril molecule in the active site of the N-domain model revealed that the full complement of structurally conserved residues was found as observed in the tACE structure, confirming that the N-domain of somatic ACE could also bind lisinopril with similar affinity, as previously reported24,44. Fifth, the S2 sub-site is formed by Asn494 and Thr496, which replace a serine and a valine, respectively, in the C-domain. Furthermore, the asparagine occurs in an N-GLYCOSYLATION SEQUON (NVT) that is unique to the N-domain; the attachment of any glycan to this residue would occlude the S2 pocket. This, in part, might explain how the bulky aromatic ring of the benzamido group in keto-ACE (an ACE inhibitor; see Fig. 5a) is accommodated by the S2 site in the C-domain (tACE), making keto-ACE more C-domain selective. Sixth, the ACE inhibitor RXP407 has an N-acetyl group that confers a certain degree of N-domain specificity22. The model of RXP407 and the N-domain reveals two residues, Arg381 and Tyr369, that form van der Waals interactions with the N-acetyl carbonyl/methyl groups (Fig. 5d). However, a glutamate and phenylalanine are substituted for these two residues in the C-domain and might exert repulsive forces in the binding of the inhibitor to the C-domain active site.",

First, the accommodation of the S2\u2032 sub-site in tACE increases the substrate-binding cavity and permits the binding of an additional amino acid to the obligatory binding site; second, Gln281, which interacts with the carboxyl terminus of lisinopril in tACE, is replaced by an arginine in ACE2. This represents an elongation of the side chain of residue 281, which causes steric conflict with the P2\u2032 residue of lisinopril when it is docked in the active site of the ACE2 model. In addition, the substitution of the leucine and phenylalanine for the hydrogen-bonding Lys511 and Tyr520, respectively, and replacement of Thr282 in tACE by the more bulky Phe274 residue, probably account for the changes in substrate specificity. There are no striking differences in the large S1\u2032 sub-sites of tACE and ACE2 except for a proline in ACE2 which corresponds to Ala354 in tACE.",

Reports of captopril-related side effects, such as loss of taste and skin rash, prompted Patchett and colleagues to focus on the design of non-sulphydryl ACE inhibitors, by reverting to carboxyl compounds and introducing additional functionalities that would complete the by-product design. Captopril did not make use of at least two potential binding sites: the S1 binding site and a hydrogen-bonding site for the amide nitrogen of the (substrate) scissile bond (Fig. 5a). So, structure\u2013activity studies were performed on a series of N-carboxyalkyl dipeptides of the general formula R-CHCO2H-A1-A2. The R group, occupying the S1 pocket, was best served by benzylmethylene, whereas A1-A2 was either Ala-Pro (as in the BPF peptides) or, surprisingly, Lys-Pro, leading to enalaprilat and lisinopril, respectively (Fig. 5a)62, which show nanomolar inhibition constants.",

Enalaprilat closely resembles the Phe-Ala-Pro sequence that was found to be the optimal C-terminal sequence among the venom peptides. The structure of the ACE\u2013lisinopril complex confirms that lisinopril makes extensive contacts with the active site, including occupation of the S1, S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 pockets, binding of a lysine by the C-terminal carboxylate, a hydrogen bond involving the (substrate) scissile amide nitrogen, and coordination of the active-site Zn2+ by the carboxyalkyl carboxylate5 (Fig. 4). Lisinopril binds with twofold greater affinity than enalaprilat63, probably because the lysine side chain makes better contacts with the deep S1\u2032 pocket, including a weak hydrogen bond between the lysyl \u03b5-amine and Glu162 (Ref. 5).",

However, there is also considerable evidence that some of the benefits of ACE inhibition derive from potentiation of BK signalling, which stimulates release of the vasodilator nitric oxide and of the fibrinolytic protein tissue plasminogen activator72,73.

Similarly, Ang1\u20137, which is derived from both Ang I and Ang II by the action of various peptidases including ACE and ACE2, opposes the actions of Ang II3,37.

ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but certain class-specific side effects have emerged, in particular cough and angioedema70. The incidence of cough has been estimated at 5\u201320% of patients and might result in the discontinuation of treatment70,75. Angioedema affects 0.1\u20130.5% of patients and can be life-threatening76. Both cough and angioedema have been attributed to alterations in levels of non-Ang peptides, especially raised BK concentration. Recently, an association has been found between ACE-inhibitor-related angioedema and low plasma levels of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that is also involved in the metabolism of BK, indicating that these individuals are at risk for developing angioedema when treated with ACE inhibitors76. The potentiation of BK signalling by ACE inhibitors (Fig. 1) seems to result not only from reduced BK degradation but also from inhibition of desensitization of the B2 BK receptor, possibly by inducing crosstalk between ACE and the B2 receptor77,78,79. Therefore, both the benefits and side effects arising from increased BK signalling by ACE inhibitors seem to be mechanistically complex and have implications for the design of N- or C-selective inhibitors (see below).",

As is the case for ACE inhibitors, ARBs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and in slowing the progression of nephropathy. Studies in myocardial infarction and heart failure have indicated a trend towards lower mortality in patients treated with ACE inhibitors versus ARBs, leading to the recommendation that ACE inhibitors remain the first-line agents in these conditions4,75,81,82. This difference might be due to the additional effect of ACE inhibitors on BK, although this comes at the cost of increased side effects75,81. Interestingly, and contrary to earlier assumptions, angioedema has also been reported with ARB therapy75,83, which might be related to unopposed activation of the AT2 receptor leading to increased BK concentrations73.",

As expected, omapatrilat was equivalent or superior to ACE inhibitors in clinical trials, but was found to be associated with a significantly higher incidence of angioedema, which has delayed its approval86. The higher incidence of angioedema is probably related to the fact that NEP also inactivates BK (Fig. 1), and its inhibition might result in even higher plasma BK levels, which together with raised concentrations of natriuretic peptides (and potentially other vasodilatory peptides) might promote vasodilation-related adverse events4,86.

Indeed, overly vigorous inhibition of neuro-hormonal activation during heart failure, by simultaneous treatment with an ACE inhibitor, an ARB and a \u03b2-blocker was associated with excess mortality in the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT)90. So, efforts to develop triple inhibitors of ACE, NEP and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1)91 might need to be re-evaluated. ECE-1, which is structurally and functionally related to NEP, is the principal activating enzyme for the potent vasopressor peptides endothelin-1 and -3 (Ref. 92), and so triple inhibitors might show even greater efficacy than single ACE or dual ACE/NEP inhibitors. However, there is clearly an even greater potential for adverse events such as angioedema.",

Second, BK potentiation by B2 receptor resensitization is maximal when both the N- and C-domains are inhibited95, indicating that a pure C-selective inhibitor will have a lower propensity for excessive BK stimulation. Third, the multiple Ang and non-Ang peptides known to be vasoactive are not hydrolysed equally by the two domains3,96, making it likely that the ratio of vasopressor to vasodilator peptides will differ between C-selective and mixed inhibitors.

Captopril has been noted to be modestly N-selective, depending on Cl\u2212 concentration, whereas lisinopril and enalaprilat are more C-selective24,44. More recently, keto-ACE, originally described in 1980 (Ref. 66), was found to exhibit a 40\u201350-fold C-selectivity96; one of the BPP peptides, BPPb, was shown to be 300-fold more C-selective100; and the phosphinic tetrapeptide RXPA380 is 3,000-fold more C-selective23.

Captopril is the smallest inhibitor and can be viewed as an N-thioalkyl derivative of the dipeptide Ala-Pro, whereas enalaprilat, lisinopril and keto-ACE are tripeptide analogues of Phe-Ala-Pro, Phe-Lys-Pro and Phe-Gly-Pro, respectively. This might indicate that a bulky P1 group \u2014 present in enalaprilat, lisinopril and keto-ACE, but absent in captopril \u2014 confers C-selectivity, and that a larger P1\u2032 side chain also promotes C-selectivity (Fig. 5b), because lisinopril is more C-selective than enalaprilat. Interestingly, trandolaprilat, although a potent inhibitor for both domains, was tenfold more C-selective24 (Table 1). Trandolaprilat contains a C-terminal hexahydroindoline group, which also indicates that a bulky P2\u2032 group confers C-selectivity. This is confirmed by results from radioligand-binding studies, which indicated that both perindoprilat and quinaprilat, which contain hexahydroindoline and tetrahydroisoquinoline groups, respectively, in the P2\u2032 position, were 45\u2013180-fold more C-selective102. Similarly, the highly C-selective tetrapeptide RXPA380 also contains a bulky methylindole group in the P2\u2032 position. These studies also indicated that lisinopril and 351A (a hydroxybenzamidine analogue of lisinopril) were 110\u2013146-fold more C-selective, reinforcing the importance of a bulky P1\u2032 group103.",

Instead, the single most important determinant for N-selectivity was an amidated C-terminal carboxyl in the P2\u2032 position, followed by an acidic group in the P2 position (Fig. 5d)22. The bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs) confirm the conclusion regarding the P2 group: BPPa, BPPb, BPPc and BPP2 all end with the sequence Ile-Pro-Pro, yet only BPPc is unselective. BPPc has a proline in the P2 position versus a lysine in the most C-selective peptide, BPPb100. Similarly, the C-selectivity of keto-ACE can probably be ascribed to a bulky P2 benzyl group (Fig. 5c); the selectivity of RXPA380 is also consistent with the proposed importance of a phenyl P2 group (Fig. 5a). Taken together, these data indicate that C-selectivity is conferred by bulky P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 groups and a large, neutral or basic P2 group, whereas N-selectivity is conferred by a blocked C-terminal carboxyl and an acidic P2 group.",

Additional modifications to the P1\u2032 group will potentially further enhance C-selectivity. Moreover, the C-terminal carboxylate of lisinopril was found to bind to Lys511, explaining the importance of a free C-terminal (P2\u2032) carboxyl for binding to the C-domain active site22. Binding to Lys511, instead of to an arginine (as originally predicted), might prompt investigation of functionalities other than carboxylates in this position. Since N-selectivity is conferred by a blocked P2\u2032 carboxylate, it can also be predicted that this sub-site is significantly different in the N-domain active site. Modelling of the S2 sub-site in the N-domain has also revealed differences, as expected (see earlier), confirming its potential utility for conferring domain selectivity (Fig. 5c,d). These considerations can form the starting point for the structure-guided design of domain-selective inhibitors, which will be refined further once the N-domain structure becomes available.",

Even more importantly, the physical orientation of the N- and C-domains in somatic ACE is unknown, as is whether there is any significant degree of domain interaction or cooperativity.

These are important tools in structural proteomics and to some extent have eliminated the scepticism about the feasibility and value of the structure-based approach. In particular, high-throughput structure-based drug design using protein crystallography has become a very attractive proposition for the pharmaceutical industry. Many examples exist today in which a combination of the three-dimensional structure of the target protein, computer-aided drug design (in silico or virtual screening), and a rational approach using high-throughput screening have produced important lead compounds that are now being evaluated in clinical trials (for recent reviews see Refs 1,2,103,104). In addition to mining the untapped riches of the human proteome, the application of modern structure-based drug design methods to existing drug targets will generate more selective compounds for known disease targets, such as ACE. We expect that next-generation, domain-selective ACE inhibitors will be a result of such endeavours.",
