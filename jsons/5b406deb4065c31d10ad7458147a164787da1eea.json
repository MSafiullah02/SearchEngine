The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus. Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers.",

Although asthmatic children do not appear to be at a higher risk to develop severe infection and wheeze does not appear to be a common symptom for paediatric patients with Covid19(2), the authors are concerned about the potential for nebulisers, being used in hospitals to treat asthma patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, for transmitting contaminated droplet particles to uninfected patients and healthcare workers.",

In a review that includes 39 trials with a total of 1897 children and 729 adults, the authors conclude: \"Nebuliser delivery produced outcomes that were not significantly better than metered-dose inhalers delivered by spacer in adults or children.\" The authors emphasize that these studies excluded people with life-threatening asthma and therefore, their results should not be extrapolated to that patient population. The conclusion of this study was that nebulisers were not superior to MDI's with spacers in preventing hospital admissions. Specifically for children, MDIs with spacer were effective at reducing the length of stay in the emergency department P a g e | 5 compared to a nebuliser (10) . Notably, home-made spacers have been demonstrated to be equally effective as commercially available spacers for improving oxygen saturation, peak flow rates and clinical scores while reducing the need for additional treatment and hospital admissions (11) .",
