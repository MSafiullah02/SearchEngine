            "text": "Initially, in the confusion of the first few days of lockdown, there was utter chaos. The established protocols were side-lined and patients asked to care on their own with dictum being \u201cstay home and stay safe\u201d. Patients faced additional challenges to their recovery path on discharges. Limited health care services in adjoining native areas, including no rehabilitation services available compound the scenario [3]. The majority may respond well to the rehabilitation protocols adopted in pre-Covid era [4]. However, the fear of an uncertain period of restrictions, additional measures to safeguard from an evolving medical emergency in an elderly population will have a profound psychological impact on recovery [5]. Recurrent episodes depending on the disease load may require lockdown restrictions for the next two years. Safety comes first even when the endeavour is to provide a reasonable outcome. The induction of patient into an orthopaedic or arthroplasty programme should be a systematic team approach with the inclusion of established patient-specific home-based rehabilitation protocol. Plans that need consideration [3] are:Preoperative identification of patient home caregivers.Training them in the basic rehabilitation protocols and exercise programmes through simulation exercises, pictorial and video study material preoperatively and during hospitalization.Educate them regarding danger or red flags of orthopaedic or arthroplasty management for early and rapid response.Devices of utility required in immediate post-operative rehabilitation at home (walker, toilet chair, heat sensor, oxygen saturation probe) to be detailed.Issue an official identity card countersigned from a competent authority at discharge to facilitate an early home-based response from a healthcare provider.Early establishment of a communication link between surgeon and patient to ensure a healthy mental attitude that you are cared for and need-based solutions are available.",
