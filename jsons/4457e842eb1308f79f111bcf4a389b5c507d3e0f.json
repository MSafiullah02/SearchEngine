In pursuit of a remedy, efforts towards automated processing of publications, like semantic modelling of papers to facilitate their digital handling, and the development of information filtering systems, are an active area of research. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of semantically modelling citation contexts for the purpose of citation recommendation. For this, we develop semantic models of citation contexts based on entities and claim structures. To assess the effectiveness and conceptual soundness of our models, we perform a large offline evaluation on several data sets and furthermore conduct a user study. Our findings show that the models can outperform a non-semantic baseline model and do, indeed, capture the kind of information they're conceptualized for.",

That is, recommending publications for the use of citation within a specific, confined context (e.g. one sentence)-as opposed to global citation recommendation and paper recommendation, where publications are recommended with respect to whole documents or user profiles. Within context-aware citation recommendation, we specifically investigate the explicit semantic modelling of citation contexts. While implicit semantic information (such as what is captured by word embeddings) greatly benefits scenarios like keyword search, we argue that the specificity of information needs in academia-e.g. finding publications that use a certain data set or address a specific problem-require a more rigidly modelled knowledge representations, such as those proposed in [21] or [8] . Regarding quality, such knowledge representations (e.g. machine readable annotations of scientific publications) would ideally be created manually by the researchers themselves (see [13] ). However, neither have such ideals become the norm in academic writing so far, nor are large scale data sets with manually created annotations available. Thus, we create semantic models of citation contexts using NLP techniques to automatically derive such knowledge representations. Using our models we investigate if and when such novel representation formats are beneficial for context-aware citation recommendation.",

We propose novel ways of deriving semantically-structured representations from citation contexts, based on entities and claims, intended for contextaware citation recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach of its kind, as previous uses of semantically-structured representations for citation recommendation were only ever applied to whole papers (i.e. in a setting where richer information including authors, list of references, venue, etc. is available). 2. We perform a large-scale offline evaluation using four data sets, in which we test the effectiveness of our models. 3. We also perform a user study to further evaluate the performance of our models and assess their conceptual soundness. 4. We make the code for our models and details of our evaluation publicly available. 1 The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2 we outline existing works on citation recommendation. We then describe in Sect. 3 the novel semantic approaches to citation recommendation. Sect. 4 is dedicated for the evaluation of our approaches. We conclude in Sect. 5. Citation recommendation can be classified into global citation recommendation and context-aware (sometimes also referred to as \"local\") citation recommendation [10] . Various approaches have been published in both areas, but there is, to the best of our knowledge, not one that both (a) is Table 2 . Semantic approaches to global citation recommendation.",

We can mention SemCir [29] as the only approach we are aware of that could be regarded as a semantic approach to context-aware citation recommendation. The explicit semantic representations are, however, not generated from citation contexts (not context-aware), but from papers (global), that are textually (not necessarily semantically) similar to the citation contexts. We therefore categorize it as a semantic global approach.",

For the simple sentence \"The paper shows that context-based methods can outperform global approaches.\", Listing 1.1 shows the user interface output of PredPatt and Fig. 1 its internal representation using Universal Dependencies (UD) [20] . Because the predicates and especially arguments in the PredPatt user interface output can get very long-e.g. \"can outperform\" (including the auxiliary verb \"can\") and \"context-based methods can outperform global approaches\" (unlikely to appear in another citation context with the exact same wording)we build our claim-based representation R claim from UD trees, as explained in the following section. R claim . For each claim that PredPatt detects, it internally builds one UD tree. To construct our claim-based representation R claim , we traverse each tree, identify the predicate and its arguments (subject and object) and save these in tuples. The exact procedure for this is given in Algorithm 1. If a sentence uses a copula (be, am, is, are, was), the actual predicate is a child node of the root with the relation type \"cop\". This is resolved at marker (a). For the identification of useful arguments (markers (b 1 ) and (b 2 ) in Algorithm 1), we look at all nouns within the UD tree and resolve compounds (\"compound\", \"mwe\", \"name\" relations), phrases split by formatting (\"goeswith\"), conjunctions (\"conj\") as well as adjectival and adverbial modifiers (\"amod\", \"advmod\"). To give an example for this, the noun \"methods\" in both trees in Fig. 1 has the adjectival modifier \"context-based\". In such a case our model would not choose \"methods\" as an argument to \"outperform\" but \"context-based methods\". Listing 1.2 shows the complete representation generated for the example sentence.",

Table 5 shows the four data sources we use as well as applied filter criteria. RefSeer and ACL-ARC are often used in related work (e.g. [5, 7] ), we therefore use both of them and two additional large data sets to ensure a thorough evaluation. Table 6 gives an overview of key properties of the training and test data for the evaluation. We split our data according to the citing paper's publication date and report #Candidate docs: the number of candidate documents to rank for a recommendation; #Test set items: the number of test set items (unit: citation contexts); Mean CC/RC : the mean number of citation contexts per recommendation candidate in the training set (i.e., a measure for how well the recommendation candidates are described, giving insight into how difficult the recommendation task for each of the data sets is). Figure 2 shows the results of our evaluation. We measure NDCG, MAP, MRR and Recall at cut-offs from 1 to 10. Note that the evaluation using the arXiv data differs from the other cases in two aspects. First, it is the only case where we can apply R 2+ NPmrk , because citation marker positions are given. Second, because for citation contexts with several citations (cf. Table 4 , \"Exemplification\") the data set lists several cited documents (instead of just a single one), we are able to treat more than a single re-predicted citation as valid. We do this by counting re-predicted \"co-citations\" as relevant when calculating MAP scores and give them a relevance of 0.5 in the NDCG calculation. This also means that, looking at higher cut-offs, NDCG and MAP values can decrease because ideal recommendations require relevant re-predictions on all ranks above the cut-off.",

            "text": "As for the performance of our models shown in Fig. 2 , we see that for each of the data sets R claim+BoW outperforms the BoW baseline in each metric and for all cut-off values. 4 R claim and R NP do not compare in performance with the two aforementioned. This suggests that the claim structures we model with R claim are not enough for well performing recommendations on their own, but do capture important information that non-semantic models (BoW) miss. R 2+ NPmrk , only present in the arXiv evaluation, gives particularly good results for lower cut-offs and performs especially well in the MRR metric. It performs the worst at high cut-offs measured by NDCG. Note that R 2+ NPmrk is only evaluated for test set items, where the model was applicable (i.e. where a noun phrase of minimum length 2 is directly preceding the citation marker; cf. Sect. 3.1). For our evaluation this was the case for 100,308 out of the 490,018 test set items (20.5%). The evaluation results for the citation marker-aware model R 2+ NPmrk indicate that it is comparatively well suited to recommend citations where there is one particularly fitting publication (e.g. a reference paper) and less suited for exemplifications (cf. Table 4 ). To obtain more insights into the nature of our evaluation data, as well as a better understanding of our models, we perform a user study in which two human raters (the two authors) judge input-output pairs of our offline evaluation (i.e. citation contexts and the recommendations given for them). For this, we randomly choose 100 citation contexts from the arXiv evaluation, so that we can include R 2+ NPmrk . For each input context, we show raters the top 5 recommendations of the 3 best performing models of the offline evaluation, i.e., BoW, R claim+BoW and R 2+ NPmrk models (resulting in 100 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 = 1500 items). Judgments are performed by looking at each citation context and the respective recommended paper. In addition, we let the raters judge the type of citation (Claim, NE, Exemplification, Other; cf. Table 4 ). Table 7 shows the results based on the raters' relevance judgments. We present measurements for all contexts, as well as each of the citation classes on its own. We note that R claim+BoW and BoW are close, but in contrast to the offline evaluation, R claim+BoW only outperforms BoW in the Recall metric. In the case of NE type citations, the R 2+ NPmrk model performs better than the other two models in all metrics. Furthermore, we can see that both R claim+BoW and R 2+ NPmrk achieve their best results for the type of citation they're designed for-Claim and NE respectively. This indicates that both models actually capture the kind of information they're conceptualized for. Compared to the offline evaluation, we measure higher numbers overall. While the user study is of considerably smaller scale and a direct comparison therefore not necessarily possible, the notably higher numbers indicate, that a re-prediction setting involves a nonnegligible number of false negatives (actually relevant recommendations counted as not relevant).",

Low cut-offs and measuring the MRR can be interpreted as emulating citations for reference publications. This interpretation is also backed by the results of the user study, where R 2+ NPmrk outperformed all other models when recommending for citation contexts that referenced a named entity or concept. We therefore conclude that R 2+ NPmrk is well suited for recommending such types of citations. Our claim-based model R claim does not compare in performance to a BoW baseline, but R claim+BoW outperforms aforementioned. We take this as an indication that the claim representation encodes important information which the non-semantic BoW model is not able to capture. In the user study R claim+BoW performs best for citation contexts, in which a claim is backed by the target citation. This suggests that the model indeed captures information related to claim structures.",

In order to investigate the merit of such approaches, we developed semantic models of citation contexts based on entities as well as claim structures. We then evaluated our models on several data sets in a citation re-prediction setting and furthermore conducted a user study. In doing so, we could demonstrate their applicability and conceptual soundness. The next step from hereon is to move from semantically informed text-based models to explicit knowledge representations. Our research also shows, that differentiating between different semantic representations of citation contexts due to varying ways of citing information is reasonable. Developing different citation recommendation approaches, depending on the semantic citation types, might therefore be a promising next step in our research.",
