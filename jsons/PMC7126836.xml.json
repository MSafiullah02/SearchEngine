Physicists are currently contributing to the modeling of complex systems by using tools and methodologies developed in statistical mechanics and theoretical physics. Econophysics  [1], [2], [3] is the term used to denote the application of statistical mechanics to economic systems. A range of methods have been introduced to investigate stock markets as a reflection of economic trends. The similarity between financial time series is an important feature of the dynamics of financial markets.",

After Pincus introduced the approximate entropy (ApEn) to quantify the concept of changing complexity  [4], [5], [6], some authors used the ApEn to measure the biologic time series  [7], [8]. Moreover, Richman et al. analyzed the shortcomings of the ApEn method and developed sample entropy (SampEn) over a broad range of conditions, it was widely applied in clinical cardiovascular studies  [9], [10]. Then Cross-ApEn and Cross-SampEn were introduced to measure the similarity of two distinct time series  [11]. These methods were constructed based on quantifying the regularity of time series, and initially aimed at estimating the system complexity of stock markets. Also, Costa et al. introduced the multiscale entropy to take into account the time scales and applied it to measure the complexity of biologic systems  [12], [13], [14]. Based on multiscale entropy and the Cross-SampEn, multiscale cross-sample entropy was proposed to analyze the similarity of two series under different time scales  [15]. For further analysis, multiscale time irreversibility was proposed to classify the financial markets and got nearly the same results  [16]. Besides, there are many other methods to analyze the similarity of different stock markets, such as multiscale detrended fluctuation analysis (MSDFA) and multiscale detrended cross-correlation analysis (MSDCCA)  [17], three-phase clustering method  [18], and Time-Varying Copula\u2013GARCH Model  [19].",

They proposed a method in which the time series can be mapped to binary symbolic sequences and the dissimilarity index can be calculated through rank-frequency.

For better consequences, Peng et al. proposed another definition for the weighting factor by using Shannon entropy  [23], and they gave another definition of the dissimilarity index, then they applied the novel definition for an information categorization approach  [24], biologic signals  [25], SARS Coronavirus  [26], and the patterns of blood pressure signals  [27].

            "text": "In previous studies, a number of works focused on the analysis of physiologic signals by using the above method. The measurement of similarity is the parameter of linguistic analysis algorithm and it is a kind of pattern analysis method. Based on this method, we take account of the situation of stock time series and choose the proper size of the word which is different from Peng et al.  [25], and then we analyze the similarity of stock markets. However, most of previous methods are applied to the time series directly and the length of the time series should be same. The information categorization method is based on symbolic sequences, so we do not need to consider the length of sequences, just choose the proper m-bit words. The financial market dynamics are driven by a number of complex factors: index at the same level, the sub-index, the economic data, trading sentiment, trading price, weight, and other stock information. For this type of intrinsically noisy system, it may be useful to simplify the dynamics via mapping the output to binary sequences, where the increase and decrease in every day of the stock market closing prices are denoted by 1 and 0, respectively  [28]. The resulting binary sequence retains important features of the dynamics generated by the underlying control system, but is tractable enough to be analyzed as a symbolic sequence. So we succeed in turning the complex stock time series to symbolic sequences, which is the first significant step to apply this method. The novelty of this information categorization method is that it incorporates elements of both information-based and word statistics-based categories since the rank order difference of each word statistics is weighted by its information content using Shannon entropy. Furthermore, the composition of these basic elements captures global information related to usage of respective elements in stock time series. Also, the phylogenetic trees based on the dissimilarity index can give us direct information about different markets to analyze the similarity among them.",

By shifting one data point at a time, the algorithm produces a collection of m-bit words over the whole time series. Therefore, it is plausible that the occurrence of these m-bit words reflects the underlying dynamics of the original time series. Different types of dynamics thus produce different distributions of these m-bit words.

Therefore, we can plot the rank number of each m-bit word in the first time series against that of the second time series (see Fig. 1\n).",

(2) for every two symbolic time series in the whole stock time series from 1991 to 2013 (Data A). For each pair of time series in Data A, the distance with m=6 is applied to the symbolic time series (Table 1\n). Then, we divide the whole time series into three subsets (Data B, C, D) and measure the distances between each pair of subjects who belong to the same subsets similarly (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4\n). Greater distance indicates less similarity and vice versa. Our results show that the distances in Table 1 are almost smaller than the distances in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4. Also, for every subset, we find that the distances between DJIA, NASDAQ, and S&P500 are quite close with small differences; the same results can be found for the distances of ShangZheng, ShenCheng, and HSI. Because the business behavior of the stock markets in the same area are influenced by similar rules and the mutual influence between markets. Besides, the US stock market is one of the world\u2019s most developed stock market, it is a mature stock market. The three major US stock indices are S&P500, NASDAQ, and DJIA, they reflect the whole financial market trends in the United States to a certain extent, so the similar characters of these three stock markets may be more obvious. But the distances shown in Table 3 are quite bigger than those shown in Table 1, Table 2, Table 4. First, the result in Table 1 reflects characters of these three stock markets in the whole time period, it shows that the three stock indices have high auto-correlation on the macro perspective; but Table 3 reflects the result after the Asian currency crisis and before the global financial crisis, in this period, most areas of Asia were influenced by the crisis, leading to many disinvestment from western countries, and the markets became more liberal and liquid, the instability of the world economy market make the US stock market more complex and changeable. And the distances in the US markets or Chinese markets are smaller than the distances from inter markets. This implies higher similarity between the stock time series in the US stock markets or Chinese stock markets, but weaker similarity in the inter markets. We know that the economic factors of stock indices in the same area should be similar, but for the Chinese stock market and the US stock market, they belong to two different countries, which have different economic background and political factors, so the similarity between two stock indices from two different stock markets should be weaker than from the same stock market. It means that in the same market, the similarity can be higher and have stronger auto-correlations.",

The distances of Data B, Data C or Data D for every two symbolic time series are shown in Fig. 2\n. Fig. 2(a)\u2013(c) shows the distances of ShangZheng (SZ), ShenCheng (SC), and HSI stock indices with the others, respectively. It is easy to find that the distances between ShangZheng (SZ) and ShenCheng (SC) indices in 1991\u20131998 are greater than in 1999\u20132007 and 2007\u20132013, which implies that the similarity of the two Chinese stock indices becomes larger after the Asian currency crisis or the global financial crisis. Likewise, the similarity between the two Chinese stock indices and the three US stock markets are much larger after the two crises. But for the HSI index, the similarity with the US stock markets becomes weaker after the two crises. Besides, the distances between HSI index and ShangZheng become smaller after the two crises, but the distances between HSI and ShenCheng are almost the same. In early 1998, the American stock market was affected by the Asian currency crisis and the yen continued to fall, then the HangSheng index began to fall sharply. But it is the early time that Hong Kong has just return to China, its economic was still influenced by the western countries. So the HSI is still close to US stock market after the Asian currency crisis. Although the United States was the source of the financial crisis, HSI index had built closer correlation with Chinese stock market at that time. During the global financial crisis, the Hong Kong stock market was affected greatly, but recovered quickly with China\u2019s economic policy; so the similarity of HSI with US stock market became weaker than with Chinese stock market after the global financial crisis. The similarity among the Chinese stock markets does not change significantly for the three time periods, but the similarity between the Chinese stock markets and the US stock markets changes significantly. Fig. 2(d)\u2013(f) shows the distances of S&P500, NASDAQ, and DJIA stock indices with the others, respectively. We can find that the distances of the three US stock markets with ShangZheng (SZ) and ShenCheng (SC) indices become smaller after the Asian currency crisis or the global financial crisis, which implies that the similarity between the three US stock markets and ShangZheng (SZ) and ShenCheng (SC) indices are larger after the two crisis, just opposite to the three US stock markets with HSI. For the mainland of Chinese stock market, the correlation between them do not have obvious change, the market was not mature and less affected by the Asian currency crisis; besides, although the market was affected heavily during the global financial crisis, with government\u2019s policy, the market recovered gradually, so the similarity between them have little change. With the integration of China and the world economy, the Chinese stock market was affected by the two crises, but has more correlation with the US stock market. Especially in the global financial crisis, the economic cooperation between China and western countries enhances the link between Chinese stock market and US stock market. Besides, in the US stock markets, the distances of one stock time series with two others become larger after the Asian currency crisis and smaller after the global financial crisis, which shows that the similarity among the three US stock markets become weaker after the Asian currency crisis and larger after the global financial crisis. We can find that the effect on the US stock market from the global financial crisis is heavier than from the Asian currency crisis, because the global financial crisis was worldwide and affect almost every US stock index, but the stock market became more stochastic after the Asian currency crisis; so the correlation between them become closer in the global financial crisis.",

The method for constructing phylogenetic trees  [30], [31], [32] is a useful tool to present our results since the algorithm arranges different groups on a branching tree to best fit the pairwise distance measurements. We note that the structure of the tree is consistent with the underlying complexity: and further down the branch the dynamics are more complex. The distance between any two groups is the summation of the horizontal lengths along the shortest path on the tree that connects them. In Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6\n, we show the result of a rooted tree for the similarity between stock time series of m=6. We can clearly find the results shown above from the phylogenetic tree, especially the abnormal changes for the HSI index from Fig. 5, Fig. 6 after the Asian currency crisis or the global financial crisis. This phenomenon may partly be due to the HSI market that can easily be influenced by the external factors. Being different from ShangZheng and ShenCheng, which are under a strong government\u2019s macroeconomic control, HSI is easily influenced by the Asian currency crisis or the global financial crisis and hard to return.",

But the Japan stock market shows rare similarity with others. It means that Japan stock market has its unique property which is unlike other stock markets in different areas. The Nikkei 225 is the most widely quoted average of Japanese equities and an internationally recognized index. Japan is a developed country in the Asian area and not like the development of Chinese market; it has its independent economic operation system and has long history in economic market. As a mature stock market, Japan stock market should be unlike other stock markets in the Asian area. Though Japan has close trade with western countries, it is still affected by the geographical environment and policy of the Asian area, especially it increases the economic correlation with China in recent years, its stock market is different from the market in America and Europe area. So the Nikkei 225 is on a separate branch. Similarly, the three US stock indices and DAX stock index are arranged along another branch. Besides, the other two stock indices in Europe and the two Chinese stock indices belong to another two separate branches. All the stock indices in the same area show larger similarity than in a different area. The information categorization analysis is able to distinguish each one from the others. The result is consistent with the consequence in Ref.  [16].",

The information categorization method consists of the rank-frequency method and the distance calculation. The rank-frequency method does not require that the length of the time series should be the same, which is convenient for calculation unlike other methods. The new distance measure, defined in Eq. (2), incorporates both a probabilistic weighting factor given by Shannon\u2019s entropy and a term related to the number of words. Besides, the values of m have little effect on the result, but when we calculate the distances of time series, we should ensure the numbers of different m-bit words are the same. So we should choose proper size of the m-bit word considering different conditions.",

We find that the Chinese stock markets show higher similarity with the US stock markets after the Asian currency crisis and the global financial crisis except for the HSI index in Hong Kong. But the similarity among the three US stock markets becomes weaker after the Asian currency crisis but larger after the global financial crisis. Besides, the similarity of the Hong Kong stock market with the Chinese stock markets is larger than with the US stock markets. Hence, one can conclude that the influence of the two big crises on the Chinese stock markets is different from the US stock markets. Then, we extend the number of analyzed stock indices by using the method. We acquire satisfactory and obvious result for the stock indices in Asia, US, and Europe stock markets. It provides a good choice to classify the different stock time series and analyze the similarity between them.",

This derivation is based on the generic statistical physics assumptions and, therefore, can be applied to a wide range of problems. With the simple measure of similarity, we can categorize different types of symbolic sequences by using standard clustering algorithms. This classification of symbolic sequences may provide very useful information about the underlying dynamical processes that generate these sequences. Furthermore, we can change the way mapping the time series to symbolic sequences, it may provide another result for the research. Maybe the definition of the dissimilarity indices are different for different objects of study. When we use the method, we should make full analysis of the background of time series. The method has been widely used in the physiologic systems and literature. This information categorization method is potentially useful because of its ability to take into account both macroscopic structures and the microscopic details of the dynamics. Now we make a preliminary research by using this method, expecting that the method can be applied to do further study on stock markets, transport system, or foreign exchange markets.",
