A lack of complete understanding of the correlates of immunity against RSV has remained a major impediment in RSV vaccine development. Neutralizing antibodies have been shown to reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease and thus remain an important goal of RSV vaccination.7\u201310 However, high levels of neutralizing antibodies are not able to prevent RSV-induced disease in all individuals.11,12 In addition, high neutralizing antibody titers alone are insufficient to prevent reinfection with RSV in infants, young children, and adults.9,11,13\u201315 Therefore, RSV vaccines in which neutralizing antibodies are the sole immune mediator for preventing secondary infection will likely not provide long-term protection in all individuals.",

            "text": "In contrast to neutralizing antibodies, the protective capacity of cell-mediated immunity against RSV infection has received substantially less attention. It has been well established that CD8 T cells provide protection during an acute RSV infection by mediating viral clearance.16\u201321 Thus, memory CD8 T cells may also provide protection against reinfection with RSV and may be desirable to elicit through vaccination. We recently evaluated the capacity for RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells to provide protection against secondary RSV infection in the absence of RSV-specific memory CD4 T cells and antibodies.22 Utilizing a dendritic cell\u2014Listeria monocytogenes (DC-LM) prime-boost immunization approach, high-magnitude, systemic memory CD8 T cells specific to the M282\u201390 (M282) immunodominant CD8 T cell epitope were generated in BALB/c mice. M282-immunized mice exhibited a significant reduction in lung viral titers following RSV challenge compared with controls undergoing an acute RSV infection. However, despite enhanced viral clearance, M282-immunized mice unexpectedly exhibited enhanced weight loss, pulmonary dysfunction, and mortality. The exacerbated morbidity and mortality observed in M282-immunized mice was mediated by the rapid IFN-\u03b3 production by memory CD8 T cells in the lung and airways.22 These results indicate that CD8 T cell epitope-specific vaccinations could have detrimental consequences following a subsequent, natural RSV infection in humans. However, given the established capacity of neutralizing antibodies to prevent RSV-associated disease severity, it is likely that the combined induction of both memory CD8 T cells and neutralizing antibodies could be an efficacious vaccine strategy.",

M282-immunized mice prophylactically treated with the RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies motavizumab or D25 exhibited significantly ameliorated weight loss, pulmonary dysfunction, and mortality following RSV infection compared with treatment with a non-neutralizing RSV-specific antibody or control IgG. Prophylactic motavizumab and D25 treatment restricted early virus replication, resulting in significantly reduced lung and serum IFN-\u03b3 levels, CD8 T cell activation, and memory CD8 T cell IFN-\u03b3 production in the lung and airways ultimately leading to survival of the mice. In contrast, therapeutic administration of either motavizumab or D25 1 day after RSV infection significantly reduced viral titers, but failed to significantly impact morbidity, mortality, or lung and serum IFN-\u03b3 levels in M282-immunized mice. These results suggest that prophylactic treatment with RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection, whereas treatment after RSV challenge is not sufficient to do so. Our results demonstrate that pre-existing neutralizing antibodies effectively protect against CD8 T cell-mediated disease, indicating that the induction of both RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells and neutralizing antibodies in combination may provide a successful vaccination strategy. Overall, our findings have important implications for RSV vaccine design and the prevention of RSV vaccine-enhanced disease.",

            "text": "As previously demonstrated, M282-immunized mice treated with control IgG exhibited substantial mortality following RSV challenge, with up to 90% of mice succumbing to infection (Fig. 1b).22 Approximately 60% of fatalities in IgG-treated mice were due to mice naturally succumbing to RSV infection, while 40% were euthanized upon reaching a humane weight loss endpoint. Similarly, mAb43 administration did not impact mortality, as mAb43-treated mice exhibited a nearly identical survival curve as control IgG-treated mice (Fig. 1b). Remarkably, M282-immunized mice administered either motavizumab or D25 were completely protected against mortality, exhibiting 100% survival following RSV infection (Fig. 1b). In addition, both motavizumab- and D25-treated mice exhibited significantly reduced clinical disease manifestations, including weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction, compared with IgG controls (Fig. 1c\u2013e). Interestingly, D25 administration reduced weight loss and enhanced pause (Penh) to a greater degree than motavizumab treatment, correlating with the potency of their in vitro neutralizing activity (Fig. 1c, d).25 In contrast, mAb43-treated mice exhibited weight loss and parameters of pulmonary dysfunction similar to IgG control-treated mice (Fig. 1c\u2013e). Consistent with these results, neutralizing antibody treatment also provided protection against lung pathology as evaluated by histology. IgG-treated M282-immunized mice exhibited extensive hyaline membrane formation (HM), scattered cellular debris, and leukocytes in airspaces, consistent with diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 1f, g; Supplementary Fig. 1).27,28 In contrast, D25-treated mice showed rare evidence of HM but extensive perivascular aggregation of leukocytes (PVA), an indicator of acute lung inflammation, compared to IgG treatment (Fig. 1f\u2013h; Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, while D25-treated mice demonstrate acute lung inflammation, their lungs are significantly protected against the more severe lung pathology associated with diffuse alveolar damage observed in IgG-treated mice. Overall, these results suggest that pre-existing neutralizing antibodies provide protection against memory CD8 T cell-mediated weight loss, pulmonary dysfunction, and severe lung pathology and completely prevent mortality following RSV infection.",

Control IgG-treated M282-immunized mice exhibited ~104 plaque-forming units (PFU) in the lungs on day 2 p.i., which declined ~1.5 logs to a low level of detectable virus on day 4 p.i. (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, mAb43-treated mice displayed a significant decrease in lung viral titers compared with IgG controls on day 2 p.i., despite its lack of in vitro neutralizing activity (Fig. 2a). As expected, prophylactic treatment with either motavizumab or D25 restricted early virus replication, with only a single mouse in each group exhibiting detectable virus in the lung on day 2 p.i. and no virus detected on day 4 p.i.

Interestingly, mAb43-treated mice exhibited intermediate IFN-\u03b3 levels in the lung on day 2 p.i. that were significantly reduced compared with IgG controls, but elevated compared with both motavizumab and D25 treatment (Fig. 2b). Lung IFN-\u03b3 levels were similar on day 4 p.i. in all M282-immunized mice regardless of antibody treatment (Fig. 2b). Similar results were observed in the serum, although IFN-\u03b3 levels remained elevated on day 4 p.i. in IgG-treated controls compared with other treatment groups (Fig. 2c).

M282-specific memory CD8 T cells expressed low levels of both CD25 and CD69 in the lung prior to secondary RSV infection on day 0 p.i. (Fig. 4b, d). Control IgG and mAb43-treated M282-immunized mice exhibited upregulation of CD25 expression on day 2 p.i., which was significantly elevated compared with either motavizumab- or D25-treated mice (Fig. 4a, b). IgG treatment resulted in significantly increased CD25 expression compared with mAb43, motavizumab, and D25 treatment on day 4 p.i. in the lung (Fig. 4a, b). Similar to CD25 expression, IgG and mAb43 administration resulted in an increase in CD69 expression compared with either motavizumab or D25 treatment on day 2 p.i., although the increase compared with motavizumab-treated mice did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4c, d).

We next evaluated whether neutralizing antibody treatment inhibited IFN-\u03b3 production by RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells. To ascertain the cellular source of IFN-\u03b3, mice were treated with brefeldin A (BFA) in vivo to directly identify cells producing IFN-\u03b3 via intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry.31 This previously established technique allows for the identification of cytokine-producing cells in vivo without the need for ex vivo stimulation.31 Using this method, we previously demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 was primarily produced by memory CD8 T cells in the lung and airways early after RSV infection in M282-immunized mice.22 Consistent with our previous results, memory CD8 T cells produced the vast majority of IFN-\u03b3 in the lung of IgG-treated mice on day 2 p.i., with a substantially lower amount of IFN-\u03b3 made by CD4 T cells and NK cells (Fig. 5a). Memory CD8 T cells in IgG-treated mice robustly produced IFN-\u03b3 in the lung on day 2 p.i. compared with mock controls administered PBS (Fig. 5a, b). Similarly, mAb43 treatment did not significantly alter the frequency of memory CD8 T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 on day 2 p.i. (Fig. 5a, b). In contrast, administration of either motavizumab or D25 neutralizing antibodies substantially reduced the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells on day 2 p.i. compared with IgG-treated mice, with D25 treatment resulting in less than 5% of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8 T cells in the lung (Fig. 5a, b). Similar results were observed when evaluating IFN-\u03b3 production by M282-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung on day 2 p.i. (Fig. 5c). M282-specific memory CD8 T cell IFN-\u03b3 production on day 4 p.i. was decreased compared with day 2 p.i. in all treatment groups, which is consistent with our previous data (Fig. 5c).22 In contrast to the lung, mAb43 treatment significantly reduced the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing M282-specific CD8 T cells in the BAL compared with IgG-treated controls (Fig. 5d). Motavizumab and D25 treatment also significantly reduced the IFN-\u03b3 production by M282-specific CD8 T cells in the BAL (Fig. 5d). These results suggest that neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduces the capacity of memory CD8 T cells in the lung and airway to produce IFN-\u03b3 following secondary RSV infection.",

Given these results, we evaluated whether the lack of IFN-\u03b3 in mice treated with neutralizing antibodies was the mechanism leading to their survival following RSV challenge. To demonstrate that low IFN-\u03b3 production resulted in protection against morbidity and mortality, IgG-, motavizumab-, and D25-treated M282-immunized mice were administered either recombinant IFN-\u03b3 protein or PBS following RSV challenge and monitored daily for morbidity and mortality (Fig. 6a). Mice were treated systemically with four doses of recombinant IFN-\u03b3 every 12 h starting 12 h p.i. to mimic the rapid and robust induction of IFN-\u03b3 protein levels in both the lung and serum of M282-immunized mice (Fig. 2b, c). As expected, IgG-treated M282-immunized mice administered recombinant IFN-\u03b3 exhibited similar mortality, weight loss, and pulmonary dysfunction as PBS controls (Fig. 6b\u2013e). Consistent with our results in Fig. 1, M282-immunized mice treated with either motavizumab or D25 and administered PBS were completely protected against mortality and experienced reduced weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction compared with IgG controls (Fig. 6b\u2013e). Remarkably, motavizumab- and D25-treated mice administered recombinant IFN-\u03b3 exhibited increased mortality following RSV challenge in contrast to their PBS control counterparts (Fig. 6b). In addition, IFN-\u03b3 administration resulted in a significant increase in weight loss and Penh, and a trending increase in MVb compared with PBS controls in both motavizumab- and D25-treated M282-immunized mice (Fig. 6c\u2013e). These results clearly demonstrate that the substantially decreased IFN-\u03b3 levels induced in neutralizing antibody-treated mice resulted in their protection against memory CD8 T cell-mediated morbidity and mortality. Overall, our data indicates that pre-existing neutralizing antibodies provide protection against memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology by preventing early virus replication, which results in reduced memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-\u03b3 production.",

M282-immunized mice were challenged with RSV, treated with control IgG, mAb43, motavizumab, and D25 antibodies i.p. 1 day later, and monitored daily for morbidity and mortality (Fig. 7a). Similar to what was observed with prophylactic treatment, mAb43 administration 1 day following infection did not prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated mortality (Fig. 7b). Surprisingly, therapeutic treatment with either motavizumab or D25 after RSV infection also did not substantially alter the survival of M282-immunized mice compared with IgG-treated controls (Fig. 7b). Although motavizumab treatment reduced the percentage of mice succumbing to RSV infection to 50% mortality compared with the 90% observed in IgG-treated mice, this change was not statistically significant (p = 0.07) (Fig. 7b). In addition to failing to prevent mortality, therapeutic neutralizing antibody treatment also did not ameliorate memory CD8 T cell-mediated weight loss or pulmonary dysfunction, as both motavizumab- and D25-treated mice exhibited disease symptoms that were nearly identical to those treated with either control IgG or mAb43 (Fig. 7c\u2013e). This was in stark contrast to what we observed with prophylactic neutralizing antibody treatment (Fig. 1b\u2013e). Similarly, naive mice given neutralizing antibody treatment 1 day after a primary RSV infection exhibited significantly decreased weight loss and Penh compared with IgG-treated controls (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results indicate that therapeutic neutralizing antibody treatment is sufficient to reduce T cell-mediated disease during a primary RSV infection, but is too late to prevent the accelerated immunopathology induced following a secondary RSV challenge in mice with pre-existing memory CD8 T cell immunity. These results suggest that although pre-existing neutralizing antibodies efficiently provide protection in M282-immunized mice, therapeutic treatment after RSV infection is not sufficient to overcome the rapid induction of memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology.",

Motavizumab and D25 restricted lung virus replication early following RSV challenge, which resulted in substantially reduced memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-\u03b3 production compared with IgG controls, leading to survival of the mice. In contrast, therapeutic treatment 1 day after RSV challenge with either motavizumab or D25 did not prevent CD8 T cell-mediated morbidity, mortality, and IFN-\u03b3 levels, despite efficiently controlling early viral titers in the lung. Therefore, neutralizing antibody administration even 1 day p.i. was too late to prevent immunopathology mediated by robust memory CD8 T cell responses.

These results suggest that mAb43 contributes to reducing the early inflammatory response in M282-immunized mice independently of the CD8 T cell response. In addition to direct antibody-mediated pathogen neutralization, antibodies may contribute to viral clearance by complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through activity of their crystallizable fragment (Fc) domains.32 Antibody Fc domains can form immune complexes that activate the complement system, resulting in the recruitment of phagocytes, opsonization, and assembly of the membrane attack complex to destroy infected target cells.33,34 Antibody immune complex-mediated activation of complement has been previously implicated in the exacerbation of vaccine-enhanced disease following RSV challenge of formalin-inactivated RSV-immunized mice.35 ADCC is mediated by antibodies binding to Fc receptors expressed on NK cells, which triggers the release of perforin and granzymes to eliminate infected target cells. ADCC contributes to antibody-mediated protection against other respiratory viruses, including influenza virus.36 Further, human RSV-specific antibodies exhibit potent ADCC activity in vitro.37 Thus, mAb43 administration may be contributing to the reduction of lung viral titers through either complement activation or ADCC.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that the severe memory CD8 T cell-mediated disease observed following RSV infection can be prevented by the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. Thus, vaccines developed to induce high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells in combination with neutralizing antibody responses may be efficacious while maintaining a suitable safety profile. Our results are consistent with those observed in human clinical trials evaluating either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment with RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies in infants. Phase III clinical trials demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with either palivizumab or motavizumab resulted in reduced RSV-associated hospitalization rates in pre-term infants.40,41 In contrast, therapeutic administration of either palivizumab or motavizumab to RSV-infected infants after hospitalization did not alter disease severity and the duration of hospitalization compared with placebo-treated RSV-infected infants.42,43 Thus, only pre-existing RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies are sufficient to reduce RSV-associated disease in humans, similar to our results reported here evaluating RSV-specific memory CD8 T cell-mediated disease in mice. Given the demonstrated ability for prophylactic administration of neutralizing antibodies to prevent RSV-associated disease in humans, it is likely that they will also be capable of mitigating potentially pathological responses mediated by human memory CD8 T cells. Overall, our findings suggest that eliciting both neutralizing antibodies and memory CD8 T cells may be an effective strategy for the development of future CD8 T cell epitope-based vaccines against RSV.",
