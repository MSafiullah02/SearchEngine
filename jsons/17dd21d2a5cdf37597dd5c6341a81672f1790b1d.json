In chronic liver failure, the occurrence of CE is not apparent on a macroscopic level. Hence the edema is not visible on conventional brain imaging, causing the clinician no concerns for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). In acute liver failure, intracranial hypertension (IH) is a looming concern to the clinician. The term intracranial hypertension (IH) specific to ALF, implies both a cause and effect. The cause refers to diffuse CE visible on brain imaging and the effect refers to elevated ICP and impending transtentorial herniation if left untreated. Acute liver failure (ALF) is a devastating disease with mortality up to 40-50% due to progressive multiorgan failure [3] . Worsening HE in ALF heralds a grim a prognosis. Grade IV HE precedes the development of cerebral edema and IH culminating in transtentorial herniation. Historically the progression from HE to transtentorial herniation accounted for up to 75-80% of deaths in ALF [4, 5] . With improved ICU care focusing on neuroprotective interventions, the mortality attributable to IH is in the range of 10-20% [6] .",

The correlation between Type C HE and increased mortality in cirrhosis has been difficult to decipher due the heterogeneity of the occurrence and impact of accruing multi-organ failure. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) remains a term in search of a more precise definition that accurately captures a dominant subset of decompensated cirrhotics with disproportionately high short-term mortality rates attributable to multiorgan failure. In the recent European Canonic study, ACLF was distinctly defined by the sequence and severity of organ dysfunction, allowing for a better understanding of the implications of HE in this critically ill subgroup [7, 8] . HE in both decompensated cirrhosis and ACLF was independently associated with increased mortality. However, mortality from HE associated with ACLF was significantly worse than the HE associated decompensated cirrhosis [9] and therefore warrants closer monitoring and early transfer to the ICU.",

            "text": "There remains no singular attributable etiology for HE. HE is a result of a complex interplay between brain ammonia, inflammation, altered neurotransmission pathways and cerebral hemodynamic dysautoregulation. Hyperammonemia continues to play a significant role in pathogenesis of HE [14, 15] . Ammonia is also thought to result in both cytotoxic and vasogenic brain edema, cerebral energy failure, excessive intracellular accumulation of the osmolyte glutamine and alterations in aquaporin-4 integral membrane proteins [16] [17] [18] [19] . Ammonia also causes membrane depolarization, calcium influx, glutamate release, activation of proteases and production of free radicals which causes nitration of neuronal proteins and mitochondrial damage [19] [20] [21] . Figure 8 . Multiple pathways of ammonia related neurotoxicity have been discovered and postulated. Most significantly they affect astrocytes where ammonia is converted into glutamine. Glutamine has multiple deleterious effect in the CNS. Glutamine results in elevated synaptic glutamate levels and inhibits GLT-1 receptor thus preventing its reuptake. Glutamate stimulates postsynaptic receptors of neurons causing anxiety, agitation and convulsions. Glutamine is taken up by astrocyte mitochondria where it is reconverted into ammonia. This in turn stimulate ROS production in mitochondria, subsequently causing inflammation and cellular swelling through mitogen activated protein kinase. Glutamine is itself osmotically active and worsens swelling. Aquaporin 4 is upregulated by ammonia and IL-1 and is associated with cellular swelling. Ammonia also stimulates L-amino transporter in BBB, thus increasing uptake of neutral amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. These compounds are building blocks for dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin in CNS. It also results in stimulation of NMDA (N-methyl d-aspartate) receptors which mediates Na-K-ATPase dysfunction resulting in loss of autoregulation. Ammonia also causes membrane depolarization, calcium influx, glutamate release, activation of proteases and production of free radicals which causes nitration of neuronal proteins and mitochondrial damage. Ammonia also stimulates lactate dehydrogenase activity with subsequent formation of lactic acid and alanine. Hyperammonemia can result in increased neurosteroids production leading to elevated GABAergic tone in CNS. The loss of integrity of blood brain barrier results in formation of vasogenic edema. Hyperemia caused by failure of ATPase pump leads to loss of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Increased activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) by ammonia toxicity results in nitric oxide production. In addition, cyclo-oxygenase gene is upregulated resulting in increased production of prostaglandins and eicosanoids which may contribute to hyperemia and increased cerebral blood flow. There is also evidence that there is microglial activation in ALF resulting in increased production of TNF alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 provides a graphic representation of the various neurotoxic mechanisms in hyperammonemia. The homeostasis of ammonia is complex process dependent on multiple organ systems. Ammonia generated in the gut is detoxified to glutamine and urea by the liver and urea in turn is excreted by the kidneys. Defective sequential detoxification of ammonia by liver and kidney due to multi-organ failure in ALF and ACLF appreciably accounts for worsening HE. Muscle and brain (astrocytes) represent auxiliary ammonia detoxification systems that convert toxic ammonia to glutamine. Resultant glutamine accumulation in astrocyte is osmotically active and thus causes intracellular swelling (cytotoxic edema) [16, 22, 23] Hence, in the cachectic and catabolic end-stage cirrhotic, skeletal muscle provides minimal refuge to the brain from ammonia. A measured plasma ammonia level in a patient only discloses a small fraction of the proverbial ice berg, with the net bulk of the ammonia concealed in the form of glutamine. Excess glutamine can only be cleared indirectly via intact liver and renal function [24] [25] [26] , without which glutamine becomes a precursor to generating more ammonia. In end-stage cirrhosis, the significant loss of muscle mass further compromises the second tier of ammonia detoxification and exposes the brain to higher concentration of plasma ammonia.",

Renal impairment which is common in cirrhosis will intensify the severity and frequency of hepatic encephalopathy Malignant cerebral edema resulting in intracranial hypertension and brain herniation appears to rely on secondary mechanisms specific to ALF. While cytotoxic edema is an explicit feature in HE, its immediate contribution to malignant edema or intracranial hypertension is dubious. In cirrhotics with HE, cytotoxic edema is present on a cellular level but often unappreciable on CT imaging. Vasogenic edema it thought to lag temporally behind cytotoxic edema and is both direct and indirectly attributable to ammonia [27] [28] [29] . Luxury perfusion due to increased cerebral blood flow and impaired autoregulation appears to be a process specific to ALF that accounts for the development of malignant cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. Mechanisms driving this process include the loss of integrity of blood brain barrier [18] , failure of ATPase pump with resultant hyperemia due to loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation, increased NO production due to increased activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase [30] , up regulation of cyclooxygenase with increased production of prostaglandins and eicosanoids resulting in hyperemia and increased cerebral blood flow [30] . Hyponatremia frequently occurs in ALF and likely contributes to increased interstitial water and the cerebral edema. Targeting higher plasma sodium goal is associated with a lower incidence of intracranial hypertension. In end-stage cirrhosis, the significant loss of muscle mass further compromises the second tier of ammonia detoxification and exposes the brain to higher concentration of plasma ammonia.",

MRI would also be helpful in this situation if it can be performed quickly. Initiating thombolytics with a negative CT alone would not suffice due to the coagulopathy and higher bleeding risk in cirrhotics and the potential that the source of the deficit was predominantly a metabolic abnormality and not a vascular phenomenon. In a single center study of 158 cirrhotic patients scanned for altered mental status, Joshi et al. revealed that 30% of head CTs were normal, 30% demonstrated increased atrophy, 17% with small vessel disease and 16% with intracranial hemorrhage [13] . The prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in ACLF was higher than decompensated cirrhosis: noted to be 23% versus 9% [13] . Given this finding, the decision to image a patient HE requires clinical discretion. If a patient with recurrent HE, presents with his/her usual presentation for HE that was witnessed by family or hospital staff, then imaging would less likely be of use. If an unresponsive patient was found on the ground, demonstrates evidence of trauma from a fall, witnessed fall or atypical presentation of HE, imaging with CT should be performed. Findings by Joshi et al. also implies that a lower threshold for performing CT should be considered in patients with ACLF possibly due to the more coagulopathic state evidence by lower platelet counts, higher INRs and lower fibrinogen levels.",

Precipitating cause should be actively sought and treated in parallel with best supportive care. Most patients with cirrhosis have protein energy malnutrition and as such there is no role of protein restriction in management of acute or chronic HE. Hypokalemia should be corrected.

This is a case of Metronidazole Induced Encephalopathy (MIE). The patient is at risk due to decreased clearance with both liver and kidney dysfunction. Metronidazole is not infrequently used off label to treat refractory HE. When used indiscriminately, accumulation of Metronidazole causes neurotoxicity affecting both peripheral nerve and central white mater. This patient had bilateral symmetrical parietal white mater demyelination and edema seen on MRI which is consistent with MIE. With supportive care, management of seizure and discontinuing metronidazole, most patient will improve with time. Limit Metronidazole use in cirrhosis to 7 days or less when possible.",

Reduction of intestinal ammonia production and absorption (a) Lactulose (beta-galactosidofructose) and Lactitol (beta-galactosidosorbitol) Despite the absence of mortality benefit, both these nonabsorbable disaccharides are currently first line agents for the treatment of HE. Lactitol is not available in the United States. Since there is absence of specific disaccharidases on the villous membranes of the human small bowel, these disaccharides freely reach the colon. In the colon, they are broken by the colonic bacteria into acids which lowers the pH. This acidification favors conversion of ammonia (NH3) into ionic ammonium (NH4 + ). Because of its very nature, ammonium ion is less permeable than ammonia and less absorbed into portal circulation. In addition, both lactulose and lactitol inhibit ammoniagenic coliform bacteria and clear ammonia by decreasing transit time. Lactulose is superior to placebo and tap water enemas and comparable to neomycin [41, 42] Lactulose is usually given orally in patients who are awake enough to swallow. Initial dose of 30-60 ml can be repeated hourly till there is a bowel movement and then dose titrated to 2-3 soft bowel movements per day. Caution should be exercised in patients with significant alteration in mental status and high aspiration risk. In addition, it should be recognized that goal of lactulose administration is not profuse diarrhea: resulting hypovolemia may actually make encephalopathy worse. Finally, lactulose can cause significant gaseous small bowel distension in paralytic ileus and make it worse. A distended abdomen in a critically ill cirrhotic patient receiving lactulose should be evaluated for an ileus and not assumed to be increased ascites. Lactulose can also be given as enema in comatose patients and those unable to swallow or lacking enteral access.",

Rifaximin has in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic flora. Current AASLD/EASL guidelines only recommend rifaximin as an add-on therapy for prevention of overt HE recurrence. Data is insufficient regarding the use of rifaximin as a first line therapy or stand-alone therapy for treatment of overt HE. Rifaximin may be used in combination with lactulose in patients with overt HE as the combined effect leads to reversal of the condition in 76% of patients vs. 50.4% in those on lactulose alone. In absence of more robust data, rifaximin 550 mg po q12h is a reasonable adjunct for severe or refractory HE, especially since it has a better side effect profile than neomycin and metronidazole. Rifaximin added to lactulose is more efficacious than lactulose alone in prevention of overt HE (43) (b) Neomycin: Oral neomycin is minimally absorbed, yet chronic administration can result in nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Evidence for use and efficacy of neomycin in HE is not robust at all, yet it is FDA approved [43, 44] . For acute HE, 1 g q6h for up to 6 days and for chronic HE, 1-2 g daily is prescribed. Given other alternatives and lack of strong evidence, use of neomycin should probably be limited (c) Metronidazole: Not FDA approved for management of HE. One small study revealed at it is as effective at Neomycin at a dose of 250 mg twice daily [45] . The concern for resistant clostridium difficile colitis and neurotoxic effects of metronidazole are valid. Liver failure and renal impairment are both predisposing factors to developing metronidazole encephalopathy (MIE), a toxidrome more recently characterized by both reversible and irreversible findings on MRI [37] [38] [39] .",

            "text": "(a) Zinc: There are a number of small studies on Zinc supplementation in cirrhosis resulting in lower plasma ammonia levels and improved hepatic encephalopathy. The biochemical rational is predicated on Zinc being a co-factor in the urea cycle. Two recent metaanalysis on zinc in HE revealed a significant neuropsychiatric improvement measured using the number correction test [46] . In the meta-analysis by Timbol et al. published in abstract form., zinc supplementation provided for a statistical significant reduction in serum ammonia levels [47] . Zinc levels are tightly associated with liver function. Cirrhotics with low zinc levels have a higher risk of hepatic decompensation and hepatic encephalopathy. In cirrhosis with hypoalbuminemia, low zinc levels may be reported since 80% of zinc in blood is albumin bound. Zinc levels are not routinely monitored unless a way to measure free plasma zinc level is developed. In the critically ill patient with HE, including zinc supplementation has the potential to improve ammonia metabolism with minimal side effects. However, long term use of zinc supplementation in concomitant renal failure does increase the possibility of zinc toxicity. (b) l-Carnitine: There are numerous small studies and anecdotal reports about the ammonia lowering effects of oral supplementation with l-Carnitine which requires further study. Carnitine is a co-factor in the metabolism of long chain fatty acids. It facilitates mitochondrial membrane transport by binding acyl-CoA molecules and promotes translocation from cytoplasm to mithochondrial matrix for B-Oxidation. Disruption in Carnitine transport results in cytosolic accumulation of fatty acyl-CoA molecules which is postulated to inhibit the urea cycle [48] . Patient with carnitine deficiency due to malnutrition or short gut, valproate acid, primary deficiency due to mutations in organic cation transporter gene (OCTN2) have been reported to manifest with symptomatic hyperammonemia which improves with carnitine supplementation. There is limited evidence on use l-Carnitine routinely in the management of HE, however, in cirrhotic patients with a significant history of malnutrition and refractory hyperammonemia, checking l-Carnitine levels followed by supplementing l-Carnitine pending the return of these levels is physiologically sound and may provide a benefit with minimal risk until further evidence is available. (c) Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation: Improvement in HE has been noted in patients predominantly treated in the outpatient setting without improvement in mortality. Existing evidence revealed no difference between BCAA, lactulose and neomycin It did however increase the risk of nausea and vomiting. Its role in the ICU remains unproven.",

Ammonia clearance is closely associated with ultrafiltration rate. More than likely, CRRT will be used in such a patient for acute kidney injury needing renal replacement; and not hyperammonemia per se. However, one can make a case for CRRT for severe hyperammonemia particularly in ALF or ACLF where the risk of intracranial hypertension and herniation is significantly higher. Hemodialysis and CRRT remains the mainstay for the management of hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle disorders with a proven track record. (b) Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) and Bio-artifical devices Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) is a blood detoxification system based on albumin dialysis that removes protein bound (bile acids, bilirubin, endogenous benzodiazepines, nitrous oxide) and water soluble toxins (ammonia, creatinine). In the US, MARS is FDA approved for management of ALF due to drug overdose or toxic exposures and for management of HE in decompensated cirrhosis. MARS trials thus far have failed to show a survival benefit; however they have consistently demonstrated improvement in HE and a satisfactory safety profile. Using MARS for refractory HE is thus a potential option. In the case of bioartificial systems, the extracorporeal circuit includes bioreactors loaded with liver cells, thus theoretically having potential to improve synthetic function as well. These extra-corporeal liver assist devices are as of now far from ideal and not widely available; these are subject of research. (c) Therapeutic Hypothermia (Goal Temperature of 34 \u00b0C) There remains limited clinical experience in the use of mild hypothermia in chronic liver failure [51] . Its appeal in liver disease is that it counteracts many of the metabolic effects of ammonia, slows protein catabolism and production of ammonia by bacteria and the kidneys [52] . The predominant concern with using hypothermia in cirrhotic patients is its potential to worsen the existing coagulopathy in patients who are high risk for bleeding and the predisposition to infection. In rare cases of extreme refractory hyperammonemia, hypothermia can be used as a transient neuroprotective strategy while pursuing clearance of plasma ammonia through other avenues.",

Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a non-invasive method to estimate ICP based on waveform characteristics due to resistance in cerebral blood flow in proximal cerebral circulation [77] . Its utility in ICP detection in ALF has not been validated prospectively and has to be interpreted with caution. Trends in TCD indicating cerebral perfusion could be useful however an easy method for continuous monitoring is not yet available [78] . Other non-invasive devices such as optic nerve sonography, technologies using near infrared spectroscopy and pupillometry have not been validated in ALF. ",

Answer: False An elevated plasma ammonia level (>150 mmol/L) in acute liver failure increases the risk of intracranial hypertension; however, a low level (<146 mmol/L) does not preclude it when associated with multiorgan failure. Vasogenic edema from hyperperfusion of the brain can occur independently of an elevated plasma ammonia levels due to the cytokine storm produced by the dying liver. Question: Brain imaging for evaluating severe hepatic encephalopathy in patients with Acute-on-chronic Liver failure is unnecessary. True or False ? Answer: Acute-on-chronic liver failure patients admitted with overt hepatic encephalopathy have a significantly higher short-term mortality rate and small but devastating risk of brain herniation (4%) and are at an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (16%). Atypical presentation of HE in these patients may warrant a head CT. In chronic liver disease without acute multiorgan failure, the yield from neuroimaging is low unless features are very atypical or there is a history of trauma. Question: Hyperammonemia in chronic liver failure causes worsening encephalopathy leading to coma, however, the effect on the brain is always reversible with treatment. True or False ? Answer: False Ammonia is neurotoxic however patients with cirrhosis have a relative tolerance to hyperammonemia. Severe and sustained hyperammonemia in cirrhosis can cause irreversible brain injury akin to patients with urea cycle disorders. The threshold at which the injury is irreversible remain unclear. Brain MRI pattern of restricted diffusion (cytotoxic edema) in hyperammonemia states correlates in severity with plasma ammonia levels and clinical outcome. Question: Induced hypothermia improves outcome in ALF by controlling ICP? True or False ? Answer: False Therapeutic hypothermia controls ICP, reduces plasma ammonia levels and is safe but does not confer a clear mortality benefit in acute liver failure.",
