Cardiac electrophysiology is a field that has been readily and immensely affected, and the Heart Rhythm Society has produced a consensus document4 regarding, among others, a classification of ablation procedures according to urgency. Moreover, NHS England has provided guidance regarding the management of cardiac patients including recommendations relevant to electrophysiology procedures.5 Based on these 2 documents, catheter ablation procedures that are considered urgent or emergent are (1) ablation of ventricular tachycardia that cannot be controlled with medication and leads to hemodynamic compromise, (2) ablation of an incessant, hemodynamically significant, severely symptomatic tachycardia (SVT/atrial flutter) not responding to antiarrhythmic drugs, rate control, and/or cardioversion, and (3) ablation for preexcited atrial flutter with syncope or cardiac arrest.",

Full PPE comprises gloves, disposable fluid-repellent long-sleeve gown/coverall, filtering face piece class 3 respirator, and full-face shield or visor.13 It is also noted in the same guidance document that \u201cSubject to local risk assessment, the same precautions apply for all patients regardless of case status in contexts of sustained COVID-19 transmission.\u201d Based on that and taking into consideration that (1) there might not be enough time for testing due to emergency conditions and (2) there is a considerable percentage of false-negative test results, we opted for full PPE in all ablation cases performed in the laboratory.",

This can be achieved for the inpatients by doing all the checks in the ICU/ward before the procedure or inside the laboratory bypassing any unnecessary staying in interim areas. Also, after the procedure, the recovery of the patient should be done in the laboratory or the ICU/ward. For patients needing general anesthesia, intubation and extubation are recommended to be performed in the ICU/ward to minimize aerosol generation and contamination of the laboratory which ideally should have a negative pressure ventilation system. For the same reason, intracardiac echocardiography is preferred over transesophageal echocardiogram depending on availability and operator expertise. Regarding the outpatients, separate designated areas should exist for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients and confirmed negative COVID-19 patients and the target should be same-day discharge if possible. If hospitalization is needed, the patient should remain in the designated preoperation day case unit to reduce the transmission of the virus.",
