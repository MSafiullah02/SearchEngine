Since the earliest known pneumonia cases of unknown origin that were identified in the Wuhan city of China in December 2019, the epidemic has rapidly spread throughout China in just several months, turning into a serious national public health crisis, and patients with the same symptoms have been gradually documented in other countries [2,3]. Under the circumstance of the significant public health risk that the international spread of epidemic poses to the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and has escalated it to a global pandemic on 11 March [4].

Even though China is temporarily the country with the largest number of cases, the increase of new cases is falling and there is evidence that the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic has passed for China [6]. Since 19 March, Wuhan, the city where the outbreak started, has reported no new confirmed or suspected cases for five consecutive days [7]. The epicenter of the outbreak was originally in China and has now been transferred to other countries such as Italy, the United States, Spain, and Germany. The WHO confirmed that \u201cEurope has now become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world\u201d [8]. Figure 1 reports the new and cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 data for China and the rest of the countries, by date of report. The figure shows a significant difference in the timing of case growth trends between the two location categories. The Chinese government has taken a series of aggressive measures in a timely manner, which have proved to be effective in alleviating the epidemic to a large extent. Consequently, the objective of this editorial is to review a selection of measures undertaken in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in China, and to provide potential evidence and guidance to other countries.",

All public transportation in Wuhan city, including bus, subway, and ferry services were suspended, and expressways, airports, and railway stations were temporarily closed. All large gatherings including the New Year celebrations were canceled. As the asymptomatic incubation period of COVID-19 could be up to 14 days, all residents were restricted to stay at home in self-quarantine, in order to prevent the spread of the virus. All public places such as shopping centers, schools, restaurants, and cinemas were closed, and food, medicine and medical supplies were uniformly deployed and distributed to all residents, by the staff of the community committees. In order to alleviate the insufficient medical resources in Wuhan city, two emergency specialty field hospitals, Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital were approved as the centers for patients with COVID-19, which provided approximately 2,400 beds. The two constructions were completed on 2 February and 6 February, respectively. Since 2 February, large venues such as stadiums and convention centers were transformed into 14 mobile cabin hospitals, for the medical observation and treatment of more than 14,000 suspected cases, mild patients, and close contacts. In addition, the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army and other provincial medical systems successively dispatched multiple medical rescue teams of more than 42,600 medical staff, to Wuhan city and the Hubei province, ensuring the adequacy of medical resources in the epidemic area.",

Under such circumstances, many enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises with weak ability to resist risks, are facing the difficult dilemma of the lack of funds and employees. The government has issued a number of targeted policies to support the survival and development of these enterprises during the outbreak. The financing cost of the enterprises has been reduced, reflecting the fact that banks reduced the loan threshold of enterprises, increased loan amounts, and reduced loan interest rates for the period of the epidemic. Enterprises seriously affected by the epidemic could apply for multiple tax relief, and the government also arranged special funds to provide subsidy support for worst-hit industries, such as aviation and transportation industries. The employees of enterprises that returned to work from other areas have also received strong support from the government and were provided with subsidies for chartered airplanes and buses. Fortunately, we have also witnessed many enterprises actively fulfill corporate social responsibility during the outbreak. These enterprises have donate large sums of money and medical equipment to the epidemic areas, some of which, such as the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation, transformed production lines to produce medical protective equipment including masks, protective clothing, and ventilators. As the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and exporter of medical protective equipment, China\u2019s safeguard measures for enterprises to return to work were related to the progress of global infection prevention and control of epidemic.

Residents were required to scan the QR code when entering and leaving every public place, hence, the outdoor routes of confirmed cases were traced and their close contacts could also be identified. Although this could fall into the debate of over whether personal privacy and human rights were violated, these measures indeed helped to identify confirmed cases and contacts in an effective and rapid manner, to control the spread of the epidemic in China [12].",

In order to reduce delays in education progress due to the outbreak, schools used internet technology to carry out innovative teaching practices based on online instead of face-to-face teaching, which also brings a rare development opportunity to online education platforms. Many universities also showed significant initiatives in taking on social responsibilities, opening up education platforms to the society without charge, sharing high-quality course resources, and in these ways, contributed to the infection prevention and control of the epidemic [13,14].",

Due to the reduced demand and residents\u2019 quarantine, the inter-provincial bus was suspended, and most of the aircraft flights and rail services were temporarily canceled. Since March, as the peak of the epidemic has passed for China and the epidemic has begun to spread on a large scale in other countries, the new focus of the response measures of the transportation system has shifted to a new stage of strictly preventing the epidemic from being imported from abroad. Since 23 March, all international flights must arrive in 12 designated first-entry cities, and all entry personnel much be forced to perform the COVID-19 detection and quarantine at the local centralized isolation points for 14 days.
