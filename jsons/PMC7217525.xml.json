            "text": "Many social, natural, and technological systems can be modeled as networks. The structure of such systems is often not fixed and exhibits complex temporal dynamics [1\u20134]. However, the large majority of studies revolve around representations that neglect the role of time [5\u20137]. In particular, connections are typically approximated as either static or annealed [8,9]. Since networks are often used as an environment for the study of dynamical processes, the choice concerning which approximation to adopt is a matter of time scales: when the process is faster than the network evolution, the network structure can be assumed static; in the opposite conditions, networks can be effectively described by annealed representations. However, when the time scale of the process studied is comparable to the one characterizing the network evolution, static or annealed approximations are not viable and can lead to incorrect conclusions such as misrepresenting (i) the spreading potential of a disease [8,10\u201328], (ii) the exploring capabilities of random walkers [29\u201333], (iii) the features of social interactions [34\u201347], or the processes of (iv) information spreading [48\u201352], (v) synchronization [53], (vi) percolation [54], (vii) consensus [55], (viii) competition [56], (ix) social contagion [57], and (x) innovation [58].",

This feature represents the propensity of a node to establish connections per unit time. In the model, each node i is equipped with an activity ai extracted from a distribution F(a). At any time step t, nodes are active and thus willing to establish connections with probability proportional to their activity. One praise of this simple mechanism is that it relates the contact dynamics to the structure of the time-integrated network: the resulting degree distribution P(k) depends on the form of F(a), and in particular a power-law distributed activity produces a power-law degree distribution [18]. This fact is particularly significant in relation to social networks, which are known to exhibit distributions of this kind both for the degree [5,59] and for the activity [18,30,34,46,60].",

The attractiveness bi of a node i is a measure of its propensity to attract contacts. Therefore, it is to some extent the reciprocal of the activity, and a natural complement to it within the model.

In particular, we consider SIS epidemic models in the case of a generic joint activity-attractiveness distribution deriving an analytic expression for the epidemic threshold. We give a detailed treatment of three scenarios. First, we examine the case of uncorrelated activity and attractiveness. Second, inspired by observations on real data [67], we study the case of positive correlation between the two variables.

The activity on the AD in distributed according to the same law as on the ADA: F(a)\u221da\u2212\u03b3a. The ratio is a function of the two exponents (TAD depends on \u03b3a only).

Higher values in the plot correspond to a lower epidemic threshold, thus to an easier spreading. In particular, when \u03b3c=0, which corresponds to the AD case as the attractiveness is constant, the spreading is maximal for \u03b3a=2 as expected.
