NK cells express an array of activating and inhibitory receptors, whose engagement allows them to discriminate between target and non\u2010target cells (3, 4, 5). The repertoire of NK cell receptors complements that of other innate sensors, such as scavanger receptors, Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) or nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins. The strategies of NK cell recognition thus broaden the detection of pathogenic situations where microbial \u2018danger signals\u2019 are missing in vivo, such as in the case of poorly immunogenic tumors.",

An early study in rat showed that the frequency of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), including NK and T\u2010cell subsets, was high in the lung and peripheral blood, superior to that in the spleen, peritoneal exudates, and lymph nodes. LGLs were also found to be absent in the thymus and bone marrow (7). Subsequent studies in the mouse have shown the presence of NK cells, defined as NK1.1+CD3\u2212 or DX5+CD3\u2212 by flow cytometry, in various organs but never focused on their distribution (8). We revisited this question and measured the percentage and number of mouse NK cells in various organs. Our results confirmed the wide distribution of NK cells in lymphoid and non\u2010lymphoid organs (Fig. 1). The frequency of NK cells in lymphocytes was found to be the highest in non\u2010lymphoid organs such as the lung and liver. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for effector memory CD8+ T cells (9), suggesting similar mechanisms of trafficking for these two cell types and the existence of a niche for interleukin\u201015 (IL\u201015)\u2010dependent lymphocytes in non\u2010lymphoid organs. The order for NK cell frequency is lung>liver>peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)>spleen>bone marrow (BM)>lymph node (LN)>thymus, where NK cells are almost undetectable. For comparison, NK1.1+ T cells predominate in the liver, while T cells prevail in blood and LN (Fig. 1). Human NK cells also appear to be frequent in non\u2010lymphoid organs (10, 11).",

In humans, CD3\u2013CD56+ NK cells have been detected in the skin of healthy donors (14) and in the lymph draining this tissue (15). An infiltration of NK cells has been reported in lesional atopic dermatitis skin, in both epidermis and dermis, after Malassezia exposure (16), and in the inflammatory skin during the elicitation phase of contact hypersensitivity in a mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis (17). Furthermore, several groups have reported an accumulation of cells expressing an NK cell phenotype in skin psoriatic lesions (18, 19, 20). However, further investigations are required to clearly determine whether infiltrating cells are \u2018true\u2019 NK cells or rather NK\u2010like T cells. In a normal human intestine, CD3\u2212 intraepithelial leukocytes expressing NK cell markers such as CD122, CD161, CD2, CD94, CD56, or CD16 have been described (21, 22, 23, 24). Finally, CD3\u2212NK1.1+ cells have been recently identified in cell suspensions prepared from mouse vaginal tissue (25). Moreover, IL\u201015\u2212/\u2212 and/or RAG2\u2212/\u2212\u03b3c\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are more sensitive to genital herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV\u20102) infection, suggesting a potential implication of NK cells in the control of infection spreading in mucosal tissues (26, 27).",

Antibodies to NKp46 and CD31 [platelet\u2010endothelial cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (PECAM\u20101), an endothelial marker] stain the same regions, suggesting that most splenic NK cells are in fact located inside blood sinuses (Fig. 2D). Occasional NKp46+ cells are found in the white pulp, but staining for CD31 suggests that many of them are in fact located within sinuses or vessels (Fig. 2D). Many other cell types can be found in the vicinity of the \u2018NK cell zone\u2019. In particular, most CD11bhigh cells (including macrophages) (Fig. 2E) are found in the red pulp and the marginal zone, whereas many CD11chigh cells (including dendritic cells) (Fig. 2F) are found not only in the white pulp but also in the marginal zone and the red pulp. Cell\u2013cell contacts between NK cells and macrophages (either of the red pulp or of the marginal zone) can be seen on these static images. These observations support the existence of interactions between NK cells and macrophages, as well as NK cells and dendritic cells. Such interactions have been extensively documented in vitro (34, 35, 36, 37) and lead to the mutual regulation of these different cell types in the orchestration of immune responses.",

Moreover, recent articles suggested that LN and thymus could be alternative sources of NK cells (39, 40). The relative contribution of these organs to the pool of NK cells is not known but is expected to be low at a steady state. Indeed, this extramedullary \u2018NK\u2010poiesis\u2019 appears to produce phenotypically distinct NK cells, expressing the \u03b1 chain of the IL\u20107 receptor (40). Such NK cells make up <5% of the total NK cells. Moreover, a careful examination of thymic NK cells reveals that many of them express CD3 intracellularly and share phenotypic and functional features with NK1.1+ T cells, suggesting that they are in fact NK\u2010like T cells (41). However, in mice where T\u2010cell development is blocked by genetic means, a very high number of NK cells develop in the thymus, showing the ability of T\u2010cell precursors to develop into NK cells under particular conditions (40). Furthermore, the normal liver contains a substantial number of immature NK cells, suggesting that NK cell precursors originating in the BM could seed the periphery and develop in situ (42). Thus, it is possible that extramedullary NK cell development may take place under lymphopenic or other conditions that remain to be dissected.",

Three stages of NK cell maturation can be defined in the mouse based on the expression of CD11b and CD27: CD27highCD11bdull (abbreviated as CD11bdull, the most immature), double\u2010positive CD11bhighCD27high (abbreviated as DP), and CD11bhigh CD27dull (abbreviated as CD27dull, the most mature) (43, 44, 45). DP and CD27dull NK cells display stronger effector functions than CD11bdull NK cells (113). The repartition of the three NK cell subsets varies with the tissue distribution. Whereas CD11bdull NK cells predominate in BM and LN, DP and especially CD27dull NK cells prevail in the blood, liver, spleen, and lung (44). As discussed later, the expression of different chemotactic receptors participates in the distinct homing capabilities of the NK cell subsets. In human, two subsets of NK cells have been described, CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells, that share many characteristics with CD11bdull and DP/CD27dull NK cells, respectively (45). This resemblance and other observations (12, 46) suggest that CD56bright could be precursors of CD56dim NK cells. Like their mouse counterparts, human CD56bright NK cells are preferentially found in the LN, whereas CD56dim cells are more abundant in the blood and spleen (12).",

Do they exit lymphoid and non\u2010lymphoid organs, or do they reside in tissues? An early study (47) showed that upon intravenous transfer into recipient rats, radiolabeled LGLs preferentially homed into the alveolar walls of the lung and the red pulp of the spleen. LGLs were found, however, to be absent from the thoracic duct and LN (47). Later, adoptive transfer experiments in mouse showed that splenic NK cells can home to the spleen, liver, and BM of recipient mice (48, 49, 50). To gain an insight into NK cell trafficking, we performed an intravenous adoptive transfer of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)\u2010labeled splenocytes into syngeneic, non\u2010irradiated recipient mice. Twenty\u2010four hours post\u2010transfer, the percentage of NK cells within lymphocytes was measured in the blood, spleen, LN, BM, lung, and liver. The results showed that the distribution of transferred NK cells paralleled that of recipient NK cells (Fig. 3), as did the distribution of NK1.1+ T cells. Moreover, the relative proportion of NK cell subsets (CD11bdull to CD27dull) was similar between recipient and donor NK cells in every organ (data not shown). This simple experiment shows that (i) splenic NK cells are not programmed to home to the spleen but instead recirculate through all NK cell\u2010containing organs and (ii) NK cell recirculation appears to be subset\u2010specific: LN and BM are preferentially repopulated by CD11bdull NK cells and the blood, spleen and lung by CD27dull NK cells.",

There are, however, important differences. In particular, CCR7 is expressed by human CD56bright NK cells, but no Ccr7 transcripts are detected in mouse CD11bdull NK cells. This difference might account for the distinct representation of NK cells in LN in humans (5% of lymphocytes) and in mice (0.5% of lymphocytes). Second, NK cells are poised to be rapidly recruited on sites of inflammation, as they express receptors for a broad range of inflammatory chemokines (CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3, CX3CR1). Third, the expression of chemotactic receptors switches over maturation in NK cells. In particular, CD27dull/CD56dim NK cells lose CXCR3 (and also CXCR4 in mouse) but acquire CX3CR1 (and also ChemR23 in human) expression, an array of receptors that are anticipated to influence their recirculation and their recruitment upon inflammation.",

However, CXCR4 seems to be uniformly expressed by NK cells from all organs. Moreover, a recent study showed that mouse treatment with a selective inhibitor of CXCR4 did not induce NK cell mobilization from the BM (63). Another study showed that NK cells were virtually absent from the periphery of CXCR3 knockout mice (64). However, three other studies did not report any defect in the distribution of NK cells in these mice (65, 66, 67), questioning the role of CXCR3 in the emigration of NK cells from BM. More recently, we found that NK cell maturation correlated with the acquisition of S1P5, one of the five sphingosine\u2010phosphate (S1P) G\u2010protein\u2010coupled receptors (113). S1P is a secreted lysophospholipid bound extensively to albumin and other plasma proteins. Coordinated activities of biosynthetic (sphingosine kinases) and biodegradative (sphingosine lyase and phosphatases) enzymes maintain S1P gradients in vivo, with high S1P concentrations in extracellular fluids and low S1P concentrations in tissues (68, 69). In S1p\n5\u2010deficient mice, a drastic decrease in peripheral NK cell counts is observed in the blood, spleen, and lung. This defective homing is NK cell\u2010intrinsic and correlates with an increased number of NK cells in the BM and LN. S1P5 operates in NK cells as a chemotactic receptor for S1P in vitro, promoting NK cell homing in the blood, spleen, and lung in vivo. The extent of NK cell accumulation in BM and LN correlates with the level of S1P5 expression (113). Altogether, these observations suggest that S1P5 provides an egress signal to NK cells, allowing both their export from the BM and their exit from LN (Fig. 6). Interestingly, Id2\n\u2212/\u2212\nE2a\n\u2212/\u2212 mice have normal BM NK cells but very few mature NK cells in the spleen (70), prompting an investigation of whether these transcription factors control S1P5 expression and/or function.",

CD62L is expressed at a similar level on mouse NK cell subsets isolated from the LN (44) and is required for mouse NK cell entry in LNs (72) (Fig. 6). Whether CD62L is sufficient for the entry is not known. As discussed previously, most mouse NK cells localize in the sinusoids around T and B\u2010cell areas, a location reminiscent of that in spleen where NK cells are found in the red pulp surrounding the white pulp. One possibility is that this area is reached by default, in the absence of CCR7 expression. Consistent with this model, human LN CD56 bright NK cells that do express CCR7 are localized, at least in part, in the T\u2010cell cortex (73). Recently, it was shown that CCR7 is induced on CD56dim cells by IL\u201018 in vitro (74), suggesting that under certain conditions, these cells could also traffic to LN.",

Human NK cell differentiation is accompanied by the cell surface expression of a mucin\u2010like glycoprotein bearing an NK cell\u2010restricted keratan sulfate\u2010related lactosamine, the PEN5 epitope (80). The PEN5 carbohydrate decorates PSGL\u20101, creating a unique binding site for L\u2010selectin, which is independent of PSGL\u20101 tyrosine sulfation (76).

These receptors allow NK cells to respond to a large array of inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL9, CCL11, CCL13, CXCL9\u201011 and CX3CL1. This broad responsiveness could warrant NK cell recruitment in situations where limited sets of chemokines are expressed. Thus, NK cell recruitment in the same tissue can be mediated by different chemokine receptors. For example, human NK cell recruitment to the epithelia appears to be dependent on CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3, or ChemR23, depending on the inflammatory conditions (20, 57, 93). Not only may NK cells respond to different chemokines, but it also seems that chemokines may act in concert to recruit them. CCR2 and CCR5 are both required for NK cell recruitment to the liver of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV)\u2010infected mice (83, 89). A similar phenomenon had been observed previously for monocytes (97). Importantly, NK cell subsets could also be differentially recruited, depending on the stimulus. Indeed, CX3CR1 but not CXCR3 is required for NK cell recruitment in the CNS in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (67, 84). Conversely, CXCR3 has a central role in NK cell recruitment to the inflammatory LN (87). As CXCR3 and CX3CR1 are expressed in a quasi\u2010mutually exclusive fashion on NK cell subsets (Fig. 5), this finding suggests that different NK cell subsets may be independently recruited in distinct inflammatory settings. Such a division of labor has already been shown for other types of leukocytes, including monocytes (98) and memory CD8+ T cells (99). Besides chemokines, NK cells have been shown to respond to various other chemotactic compounds that are either induced or augmented upon inflammation. These include lysophosphatidic acid (100), N\u2010formyl\u2010methionyl\u2010leucyl\u2010phenylalanine (f\u2010MLP) (101), leukotrienes (102), and C5a (103).

The role of LFA1 (leukocyte function\u2010associated antigen\u20101), as for other leukocytes, has been shown to be central in NK cell extravasation (104). Interestingly, NK cells sequentially express different integrins over development and maturation (43). To gain an insight into this phenomenon, we examined integrin expression at the mRNA level in sorted NK cells subsets, using microarrays. All NK cells express many transcripts of integrins involved in extravasation (Table 1). As reported previously, we found that CD49b and CD11b were acquired while CD51 was decreased upon NK cell maturation. Our data also show that CD11c and especially CD61 (\u03b23 integrin) are decreased upon maturation. The significance of this observation is unclear, but different sets of integrins may contribute to the differential recruitment of NK cell subsets upon inflammation. Besides integrins, NK cell adhesion to the endothelium could also be mediated by CX3CR1. Indeed, it was reported previously that CX3CL1 mediates the rapid capture, integrin\u2010independent firm adhesion, and activation of circulating leukocytes under flowthrough CX3CR1 (105).",
