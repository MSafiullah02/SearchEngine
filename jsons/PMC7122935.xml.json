On a supine AP image, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, pulmonary edema, and layering pleural effusions make detection of a small pneumonia almost impossible. Indicate this limitation to the referring physician by stating something like: \u201cIn the appropriate clinical setting, it would be extremely difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia.\u201dEspecially in the retrocardiac area on the lateral view, it may be difficult to detect a subtle pneumonia. Normally, you should see discrete tubular structure representing pulmonary vessels. Opacification obscuring these vessels is the earliest sign of pneumonia (Fig. 6.1; see Fig. e6.1).(All electronic images (Figs. e6.1\u2013e6.54) can be found on this chapter\u2019s website on SpringerLink: [10.1007/978-3-030-16826-1_6])Any asymmetry in the lungs on a frontal view may be the earliest sign of an area of consolidation (Fig. 6.2).In hospitalized, bedridden patients, it often is impossible to determine whether a consolidation represents aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Consider using the term \u201caspiration/pneumonia\u201d to indicate this to the referring physician.\n\n\n",
