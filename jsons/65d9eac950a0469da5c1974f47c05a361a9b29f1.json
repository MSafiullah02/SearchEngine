            "text": "Damage control resuscitation (DCR) has become a topic of increasing relevance and popularity over the past several years. Hemorrhage secondary to trauma accounts for 40 % of trauma fatalities and comprises the leading cause of preventable death in trauma [ 1 ] . Research in military and civilian populations regarding DCR has focused on ways to improve survival in patients with severe hemorrhage. It should be mentioned that the majority of trauma patients do not require DCR and that its techniques should be reserved for those who are the most severely injured [ 2 ] . For these patients the rapid and effective use of techniques to control bleeding and correction of this hemostatic derangement coined as acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS) is essential. The perpetuating combination of acute coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis seen in exsanguinating trauma patients is a well-recognized term known as lethal triad (Fig. 3.1 ) . In a practical standpoint, the vicious cycle of acidosis/hypothermia/coagulopathy must be aimed as potential lethal cycle and corrected immediately. DCR combines two seemingly diverse strategies-permissive hypotension and hemostatic resuscitation-with damage control surgery, integrating these three procedures in one dynamic process. Therefore, DCR is designed to proceed hand in hand with damage control surgery. The sequential strategy of operation followed by resuscitation has been replaced by an integrated approach so that resuscitation and surgery are undertaken simultaneously, with close communication and cooperation between surgeon and anesthetist [ 2 -5 ] .",

Its use may result in a dilution of clotting factors or role blood and therefore poorer control of bleeding and impaired oxygen transport to tissues causing further ischemic damage. Additionally, crystalloids have an acidic pH, and the administration of large quantities of isotonic or slightly hypertonic crystalloid solutions such as 0.9 % normal saline or lactated Ringer's could cause or aggravate metabolic acidosis, another component of the \"lethal triad\" leading to a decrease in myocardial function and cell apoptosis [ 6 -9 ] .",

The higher the vessel pressure, the harder it is for the bleeding to stop, since the fluid essentially \"pushes\" the clot out and consequently the bleeding resumes. In another words, it is reasonable to think that hypotension facilitates coagulation. Attempts to normalize blood pressure in case of uncontrolled bleeding as in victims of penetrating trauma may result in increased blood loss and worsen outcomes [ 10 ] . Another issue with aggressive fluid resuscitation is the potential for hypothermia if fluids that are stored at room temperature are used. If these fluids are not warmed prior to infusion, this can result in a significant drop in core body temperature. As exposed in Fig. 3 .1 , hypothermia is associated with many problems including bleeding disorder, organ failure, and hypotension and is one of the three components in the \"lethal triad,\" condition that must be feared and soon corrected by all trauma specialists [ 5 -8 ] .",

            "text": "Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is a hemostatic agent originally developed to treat hemophilia, FVII deficiency, and Glanzmann thrombasthenia patients refractory to platelet transfusion. The activation of platelets at the site of injury is the reason for a localized action of rFVIIa, as it causes clotting at the site of bleeding. The dose ranges from 60 to 200 g/kg; however, prospective randomized controlled clinical trials using different doses of rFVIIa are needed to explore the potential efficacy of lower doses in traumatic coagulopathy to reduce cost and adverse effects, such as thromboembolic complications [ 24 ] . The efficacy and safety of rFVIIa as an adjunct therapy for bleeding control in patients with severe blunt and penetrating trauma were evaluated in a parallel randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind clinical trial [ 25 ] . The authors compared three doses of rFVIIa (doses of 200, 100, and 100 \u03bcg/kg) with three doses of placebo in addition to standard treatment in patients who received 6 units of RBCs within a 4-h period. In blunt trauma (143 patients), RBC transfusion was significantly reduced with rFVIIa compared to placebo, and the need for massive transfusion (defined as 20 units of RBCs) was reduced (14 % vs. 33 %, respectively). In penetrating trauma (134 patients), there was no reduction in mortality and complications or reduction of PRBCs transfused in patients receiving rFVIIa. Adverse effects, including thromboembolic events (a total of 12, six in each group), were distributed equally between the groups. The authors concluded that rFVIIa is safe within the investigated dose and may be a promising adjunct to existing therapy in trauma [ 25 ] . The effects of liberally administering rFVIIa in hemorrhaging trauma patients are unknown because its procoagulant effect must be balanced against a real risk of thromboembolic events. At present, the use of rFVIIa in correcting coagulopathy from trauma is off-label and has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration [ 26 ] .",

The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA), a lysine analogue, interferes with the binding of plasminogen to fibrin, which is necessary for plasmin activation. Fibrinolysis consists of activated plamin cleaving fibrin. Antifibrinolytic drugs can prevent clot breakdown and thus reduce blood loss in trauma [ 28 , 29 ] . TXA has recently been shown to reduce deaths in a large population of trauma patients. In 2011, the CRASH-2 investigators published an exploratory analysis of the previous trial that specifically evaluated the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding subdivided by time from treatment to injury. The results showed that earlier treatment with tranexamic acid is more effective in reducing the risk of death due to bleeding. Patients that received tranexamic acid within 1 h of injury had a death rate due to bleeding of 5.3 % versus 7.7 % for placebo (RR 0.79, CI 0.64-0.97; p < 0.0001). Similarly, patients that received treatment between 1 and 3 h from injury also had a significantly lower risk of death due to bleeding. However, patients receiving tranexamic acid >3 h from injury had a significantly increased risk of death compared to placebo, 4.4 % versus 3.1 %, respectively (RR 1.44, CI 1.12-1.84; p = 0.004) [ 28 ] .",

Although the shelf life of packed red cell units is around 6 weeks, adverse effects of administrationwhich are thought to be mediated by passenger leukocyteshave been shown with units at a storage age of about 2 weeks. When blood is stored, the level of antioxidants decreases, resulting in oxidative damage that converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which cannot bind to oxygen. If blood is stored for more than 7 days, it loses 2,3-DPG. Without 2,3-DPG, the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left and less oxygen moves into the tissues. Storage also promotes hemolysis and acidosis. Researchers have found that transfused blood is an independent predictor of multisystem organ failure and death [ 14 , 19 ] .",

Temporary clamping, packing, shunting, or ligation controls hemorrhage, and hollow viscus injuries are either closed or resected without anastomosis. On completion of the procedure, the abdomen is temporarily closed using an improvised or commercially available topical negative pressure dressing, which saves time, helps to minimize the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension, and facilitates observation of the volume and nature of drainage from the abdomen. Planned reoperation to restore anatomy and achieve definitive repair is carried out on return to normal physiology.
