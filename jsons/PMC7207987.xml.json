As has been previously reported in the literature (e.g., Hu and Bentler 1999; Kline 2015), GFI, NFI, and CFI \u2265 .90 and SRMR \u2264 .08 were considered an indication of acceptable fit. After establishing the factorial structure of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the discrimination, difficulty, and informativeness of the scale was examined using the Item Response Theory (IRT; Chalmers 2012), which allows us to have more detailed and reliable information at the individual and item level than classical test theory. These basic aspects of the IRT parameters can be described by the item characteristic curve (ICC), which is a curve shaped like an \u201cS\u201d was used in ICC analysis, and were carried out using the Graded Response Model (GRM) which is appropriate for 5-point Likert-type scales. Based on guidelines proposed by Baker (2001), an \u03b1 value > 1.0 is considered highly discriminant. Furthermore, corrected item-total correlation coefficients and descriptive statistics for each item were also examined. The correlations between fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction were examined to establish the concurrent validity of the scale. Furthermore, the mediating role of psychological distress on the relationships between fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction was tested for incremental validity. Process Macro for SPSS developed by Hayes (2018) was adopted to test the proposed mediation model. Five thousand bootstrap replicates were drawn and coefficients for both direct and indirect effects were created in the 95% confidence interval. Significance was determined when the confidence interval did not include zero. Cronbach\u2019s alpha, McDonald\u2019s omega, Guttmann\u2019s lambda, and composite reliability were examined for the reliability of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The analyses of the present study were run using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0, Amos Graphics 24, Stata 14, and JASP 0.11.1.",

The aim of this study was to adapt The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (Ahorsu et al. 2020) into Turkish and investigate the relationships between fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. The CFA confirmed the unidimensionality of the 7-item scale on a Turkish sample. All factor loadings of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale were also found statistically significant. Therefore, we can conclude that the Turkish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale supported the structure of the original scale by Ahorsu et al. (2020).",

IRT and classical test theory (CTT) are two different measurement frameworks. CTT has a significant shortcoming. The summed scores are sequential; statistical inferences derived from sequence scores are likely to be invalid since it is assumed that raw scores should be regarded as a range scale (Jafari et al. 2012). To illustrate, CTT uses a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree) as an interval scale in which items were scored from zero to four where the differences between the five points may not be equal whereas the IRT employs logistic regression which allows us to predict the underlying capabilities of participants and item challenges. Hence, the interval-level measurement of each participant\u2019s COVID-19 fear and the interval-level measurements of item challenges were examined. The characteristics and validity of the items are examined using IRT, and the fitness of the items was calculated. Based on IRT results, the item challenges and characteristics of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale were appropriate.",

The fear of COVID-19 was found negatively correlated with life satisfaction. Additionally, the fear of COVID-19 was shown to increase depression, anxiety, and stress and to decrease life satisfaction. Limited number of studies also demonstrated that the fear of COVID-19 led to higher levels of psychological distress and poor mental health. For instance, Ahorsu et al. (2020) suggested that the fear of COVID-19 has positive associations with hospital anxiety and depression. Constant exposure to the news about worldwide fatalities or infection rate of the pandemic has led individuals to experience fear, anxiety, and depression. The worries about the risk of getting infected increase fear among the general public (Lin 2020).",

Second, the findings of this study were based on self-report data which has the risk of source bias. Third, although more than one reliability analyses were carried out, the test-retest reliability of the scale cannot be examined for the sake of the scale to be used in Turkish language promptly. Therefore, we do not have any information regarding the temporal reliability of the scale. Despite its limitations, the findings of this study will help mental health professionals to deal with the mental health problems of general public generated by COVID-19. Additionally, the adaptation study of The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was conducted using a large sample of participants with varying ages from 75 cities in Turkey. The use of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale can give a rise to the assessment of the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on individuals. Mental health professionals should investigate the relationships between the fear of COVID-19 and panic attack, obsessive compulsive disorder, and stigma. Finally, Pakpour and Griffiths (2020) emphasized the importance of determining the risk groups based on socio-demographic variables in order to develop prevention programs to help overcome fear of COVID-19. Therefore, psychological interventions can be designed to alleviate the traumatic effects of COVID-19 by using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale.",
