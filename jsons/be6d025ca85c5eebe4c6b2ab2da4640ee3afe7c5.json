            "text": "The spread of the potentially lethal coronavirus disease 19 , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has taken the world health community by surprise. As of April 4, 2020, 3 months after the disease outbreak in Wuhan, China, 1-3 COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and accounted for more than 973,300 confirmed cases and 55,321 deaths throughout the world. 4 COVID-19 typical symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea, and pneumonia; in most severe cases complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur, with eventual fatal consequences. 5 The structural similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, particularly in the spike (S) protein that mediates coronavirus attachment and entry into target cells, has allowed for the rapid identification of the mechanism of viral infection. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through the N-terminal S1 subunit, [6] [7] [8] which is subsequently cleaved by the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) to expose the C-terminal S2 subunit that induces virus-cell fusion. 8, 9 The ACE2 receptor is found expressed at high levels not only in alveolar type-2 cells in the lung but also in liver cholangiocytes, myocardial cells, esophagus keratinocytes, kidney proximal tubules, bladder urothelial cells, and gastrointestinal epithelial cells. 10, 11 Of note, in silico searches in publicly available databases have determined that the small intestine has the highest expression of ACE2 and that TMPRSS2 is also expressed at high levels in both the small intestine and the colon (the Human Protein Atlas 12 ). Furthermore, in vitro assays have shown that the human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line Caco-2 expresses both proteins and is easily infected by viral particles bearing the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. 8 These findings pose the question of whether the intestine acts as a secondary site for coronavirus tropism and infection. This hypothesis is supported by 2003 and 2020 reports that identified viral replication and nucleocapsid protein staining in small and large intestine samples from 5 SARS patients and 1 COVID-19 patient. 13, 14 Moreover, viral RNA can be detected in rectal swabs and stool of SARS and COVID-19 patients long after nasopharyngeal swabs test negative, which indicates that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may actively replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to concerns of fecal-oral transmission. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Similar to SARS, which caused gastrointestinal symptoms in up to 38% individuals of a 138-patient cohort, 13 COVID-19 can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 18 These symptoms may lead to confusion with respect to flares of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, clinicians and patients with IBD are worried about the implications of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 in the context of the underlying disease and the medications to treat it. On the one hand, it is unclear whether gastrointestinal and/ or systemic inflammation may alter the expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, facilitating viral entry. There is also concern about the medications taken by patients with IBD, which include immunomodulators, biologics, and small molecule inhibitors of Janus kinase1/2, which increase the susceptibility of the reactivation of latent viruses. 19 On the other hand, in severe cases of COVID-19, cytokine release syndrome may worsen pulmonary injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. 20 Certain biologics, notably tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin (IL)-6R antibody, may have some efficacy to prevent death. Thus, the balanced effect of medications for IBD to treat the inflammation vs to suppress viral immunity are unclear.",

We included patients diagnosed with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) with or without active inflammation determined by endoscopy and by histology. Endoscopic tissue was collected from patients who underwent colonoscopy as part of clinical care. Biopsies from the terminal ileum, ascending colon, and sigmoid colon were collected and annotated with respect to inflammation based on endoscopy and pathology. In the first cohort (n = 31, Table 1 ), biopsy tissue was processed to enrich for lamina propria CD11b + cells. Our second cohort (n = 34 patients) had baseline tissue biopsies and matched blood samples collected as part of a study to identify markers of response to vedolizumab in which CD4 + memory T-cells and regulatory T-cells were isolated (Tmem/Treg cohort; Table 1 ). Fourteen to sixteen weeks after starting vedolizumab, blood was collected for effector T-cells and regulatory T-cells, and patients were designated as responders or nonresponders to vedolizumab. This study was performed at the Crohn's and Colitis Center at the University of Miami and was approved by the University of Miami Institutional Review Board (IRB ID 20150750, 20080011). All clinical and demographic data were collected with written informed consent before enrollment.

In the analysis of the TMPRSS2 gene, we also included disease duration. Moreover, patient random effects were included in the mixed models to account for correlations in gene expression levels resulting from multiple samples within the same subject.

Whole tissues and IECs were collected from the duodenum, terminal ileum, and mid-colon of C57Bl/6 mice and analyzed for the mRNA expression of both proteins by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We identified ACE2 as a gene with high expression levels in whole tissue and IECs from the duodenum and the terminal ileum (Fig. 1A) . Conversely, TMPRSS2 was highly expressed in the whole colon and IECs from the duodenum and the colon (Fig. 1A) . We then compared the expression of both genes in these 3 segments. Expression of ACE2 was highest in the duodenum and progressively reduced toward the ileum (Fig. 1B, left panel) . Notably, the level of ACE2 transcripts was markedly reduced in the colon (duodenum = 1.07 \u00b1 0.45 vs ileum = 0.58 \u00b1 0.13 vs colon = 0.006 \u00b1 0.005 fold, n = 6), suggesting that this location could be less prone to infection by SARS-CoV-2.

To improve our understanding of the regulation of Ace2 during inflammation, we analyzed the expression of this gene in colonic IECs isolated on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 of DSSinduced colitis. We previously reported that on day 4 after DSS commencement, mice showed crypt destruction, increased immune cell recruitment, and a trend of increased neutrophil infiltration as determined by MPO activity. 21 Subsequently, MPO levels were significantly increased on day 6 after DSS. Here we also report a marked although not significant increase in the expression of epithelial IL-1\u03b2 on day 4 that became significant by day 6 of DSS administration (day 0 = 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 vs day 4 = 39.38 \u00b1 27.3 vs day 6 = 108.2 \u00b1 54.25 fold, n = 5; Fig. 2C , left panel). In these conditions, Ace2 transcripts were significantly downregulated on days 4 and 6 (day 0 = 1.05 \u00b1 0.33 vs day 4 = 0.44 \u00b1 0.2 vs day 6 = 0.25 \u00b1 0.13 fold, n = 5; Fig. 2C , right panel), suggesting that the onset of inflammation leads to a reduction in the expression of this gene in colonic IECs. To corroborate these findings, we analyzed the correlation between the epithelial expression of Ace2 and the MPO values of matched whole colon tissue. We observed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.5623, P = 0.0099) between both parameters (Fig. 2D, left panel) , indicating that higher amounts of neutrophil infiltration are associated with reduced expression of Ace2. Furthermore, the correlation between Ace2 and IL-1\u03b2 expressed in IECs was more significantly negative (r = -0.6689, P = 0.0013; Fig. 2D, right panel) , suggesting that the inflammation status in the IECs determines the transcriptomic profile of Ace2. These results suggest that active inflammation reduces the epithelial expression of Ace2 although whole tissue levels remain similar.",

Given that intestinal organoids retain not only genetic 32, 33 but also functional, 34 epigenetic, 35 and transcriptomic 26 features of their original tissue, we reasoned that their transcriptional profiles can reliably represent those of IECs in patients with IBD. Therefore, we analyzed a gene expression dataset consisting of a microarray performed on differentiated colon organoids developed from 8 UC patients and 11 control patients without IBD (GSE75916 26 ). Previous analyses in this dataset showed that differentiated colonoids from patients with UC have a transcriptomic signature that is different from that of non-IBD colonoids even in steady-state conditions. 26 However, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was similar between differentiated colonoids of patients with UC and control patients here (Fig. 3A) , suggesting that colon IECs from patients with UC in baseline conditions are not at higher risk of inducing SARS-CoV-2 tropism. To characterize the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 during inflammation, we analyzed a second microarray dataset consisting of colonic biopsies taken from the edge of inflamed ulcers in a cohort of 97 patients with UC (74 with active disease, 23 with inactive disease), 8 patients with CD, and 11 control patients screened for polyps (GSE59071 25 ). Similar to our results in whole colon tissue from inflamed mice, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in mucosal biopsies was similar between control patients and patients with active UC or CD (Figs. 3B-D) . Nevertheless, we observed a modestly higher expression of ACE2 in active UC when compared to inactive UC (active UC = 9.46 \u00b1 0.89 vs inactive UC = 8.35 \u00b1 0.94 arbitrary units, FDR = 8.63E-5; Fig. 3E, left panel) . Taken together with our mouse model observations, these data show that expression of both genes is stable in colon tissue during inflammation.",

The CD11b + cells contain a population of neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the gut and form part of the first line of defense against pathogens crossing the epithelial barrier. These cells were isolated using magnetic sorting and had a purity of about 70%, with other cell types, including IECs, making up the rest. 36 The RNA of CD11b-enriched cells was sequenced and analyzed for the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes.

We also looked at the effect of inflammation in the ileum and colon regardless of disease type. We used the strictest definition of inflammation based on the microscopic appearance as evaluated by dedicated gastrointestinal pathologists. We did not find significant differences in the expression of these 2 genes in the presence or absence of inflammation in the ileum or the colon (Fig. 4C) .

Furthermore, this model identified a significant positive correlation between the expression of TMPRSS2 and the years with disease, suggesting that this gene increases with IBD over time (Fig. 5B) . Comparison of residuals also showed an increased expression of TMPRSS2 in patients treated with vedolizumab when compared with patients taking any other drugs (Fig. 5C, left panel) .

Blood samples and matched tissue samples were obtained in patients with CD and UC. Effector T-cells (CD3 + CD4 + CD25 -CD45RO + CCR7 -) and regulatory T-cells (CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + CD45RO + CCR7 -) were isolated from tissue biopsies and from blood. In general, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed at undetectable levels in effector T-cells and regulatory T-cells in blood. We found that ACE2 was detectable in blood-derived effector T-cells and regulatory T cells in 2/62 and 5/41 samples, respectively (Supplementary Table  3 ). In biopsy samples, the expression of ACE2 was seen in memory T-cells and regulatory T-cells in 5/47 and 3/20 samples, respectively. All expression levels were low. By contrast, TMPRSS2 was more highly expressed in lamina propria effector T-cells and regulatory T-cells (23/47 and 13/20, respectively; Supplementary Table 3 ). These data led us to conclude that the T-cell compartment in the intestine is less susceptible as a target for viral entry.",

These findings suggest that inflammation may modulate the expression of these proteins. Therefore, we undertook this study to determine their expression levels in the gut of patients with IBD as a surrogate for whether patients with IBD are at greater risk of viral infection-because of either local inflammation or medications. We have addressed these questions using a combination of publicly available datasets from IBD samples, our own well-annotated samples from patients with IBD who have undergone RNA sequencing, and 3 animal models of IBD. We can say based on both the animal and human data that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the ileum and the colon. Although we do not have the corresponding human data, the duodenum seems to have the highest expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in mice, suggesting that it may be the most accessible location for viral entry in the event of fecal-oral transmission.",

Under homeostatic conditions, mouse IECs had a high expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 when compared to whole tissue. In the DSS acute colitis model, we found that isolated IECs very clearly decreased the expression of Ace2 in the face of inflammation. However, the whole intestinal mucosa in both patients and mice had similar expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the presence or absence of inflammation. The only exception was UC; there was a slightly higher level of ACE2 expression in active UC than in inactive UC. In innate immune cells isolated from biopsies of patients with CD and UC, we also did not see a change with inflammation in the expression of these genes.

Our study cannot conclude whether ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression tracks with its transcriptional level or whether functionally the expression permits viral entry. We also had a mixture of CD11b + cells (approximately 70.7%) and IECs and fibroblasts. In situ hybridization staining of ACE2 mRNA in the Human Protein Atlas 12 database has shown a clear epithelial pattern, which suggests that the expression levels we report were likely a hybrid of innate immune cells and IECs, with a higher contribution of IECs.
