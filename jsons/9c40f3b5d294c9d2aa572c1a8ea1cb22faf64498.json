As PBB shares common features with other pediatric conditions, further characterization is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy among clinicians. In this study, we aim to further delineate the clinical and laboratory features of PBB in a larger cohort, with a specifi c focus on concurrent viral detection. Methods: Children with and without PBB (control subjects) undergoing fl exible bronchoscopy were prospectively recruited. Basic immune function testing and lymphocyte subset analyses were performed. BAL specimens were processed for cellularity and microbiology. Viruses were identifi ed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacteria were identifi ed via culture. Results: The median age of the 104 children (69% male) with PBB was 19 months (interquartile range [IQR], 12-30 mo). Compared with control subjects, children with PBB were more likely to have attended childcare (OR, 8.43; 95% CI, 2.34-30.46). High rates of wheeze were present in both groups, and tracheobronchomalacia was common. Children with PBB had signifi cantly elevated percentages of neutrophils in the lower airways compared with control subjects, and adenovirus was more likely to be detected in BAL specimens in those with PBB (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 1.50-29.80). Median CD56 and CD16 natural killer (NK) cell levels in blood were elevated for age in children with PBB (0.7 3 10 9 /L; IQR, 0.5-0.9 cells/L). Conclusions: Children with PBB are, typically, very young boys with prolonged wet cough and parent-reported wheeze who have attended childcare.

We have demonstrated that antibody-mediated responses (to a protein-based [tetanus] and conjugate [ H infl uenzae type b] vaccine) and lymphocyte subsets are normal in PBB, with the exception of elevated levels of NK cells CD16 1 and CD56 1 . This is a novel fi nding, and likely to be associated with recent viral infection. Although the crosssectional nature of this study precludes making causal associations, it is probable that the high NK-cell levels seen in children with PBB were related to elevated virus detection rates in BAL specimens (38% of BAL specimens on a standard respiratory panel and 67% of BAL specimens on an extended viral panel). Moreover, the association between HAdV in BAL specimens and NK-cell elevation is consistent with published literature suggesting that NK cells play a role in innate immune defense against HAdV. 31 Although we are unable to draw conclusions regarding the significance of HAdV in the airways of children with PBB, it deserves further research. A possible mechanism includes reactivation of HAdV in response to certain stresses, as HAdV can remain in a quiescent state in tonsillar and adenoidal tissue. 32 In accordance with previous fi ndings, 33 increased total cell counts, neutrophilia, and reduced percentage wet cough in PBB, we observed high rates of parentreported wheeze, and an association between PBB and childcare attendance.
