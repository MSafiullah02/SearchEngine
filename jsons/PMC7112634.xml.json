            "text": "PRRSV suddenly emerged during the late eighties. The virus spread quickly and became enzootic in pig populations all over the world. An uncomplicated PRRSV infection, particularly under experimental circumstances and with European virus isolates, fails to induce overt respiratory disease (Van Reeth et al., 1996, Solano et al., 1997, Labarque et al., 2000). Still, PRRSV is considered as one of the most important etiological agents in multifactorial respiratory disease of swine, both in Europe and in the US (Done and Paton, 1995, Thacker, 2001, Brockmeier et al., 2002). Few studies, however, have been able to reproduce clinical respiratory disease by experimental inoculation with PRRSV followed by a secondary virus or bacterium. Dual infections have been performed with PRRSV followed by various bacteria such as Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella choleraesuis and Streptococcus suis (Galina et al., 1994, Albina et al., 1995, Cooper et al., 1995, Van Alstine et al., 1996, Carvalho et al., 1997, Pol et al., 1997, Solano et al., 1997, Segal\u00e9s et al., 1999, Thacker et al., 1999, Brockmeier et al., 2000, Halbur et al., 2000, Thanawongnuwech et al., 2000, Wills et al., 2000, Brockmeier et al., 2001, Schmitt et al., 2001). The outcome of these combinations ranged from no interaction (H. parasuis and P. multocida) to increased lung colonization (B. bronchiseptica) or increased mortality (S. suis). Most important, many of these studies yielded conflicting results. Using the same PRRSV\u2013bacterium combination no disease was reported by some researchers and severe disease by others (Albina et al., 1995, Cooper et al., 1995, Van Alstine et al., 1996, Thacker et al., 1999, Wills et al., 2000). In the latter case, it was not always clear whether the effects of the combined inoculation were additive or synergistic. One exception was the combination of PRRSV and S. suis: a true synergistic interaction between both agents was reproduced by two different groups. However, the mechanisms underlying the interactions between PRRSV and the respective bacteria have remained largely unexplored in these studies.",

The clinical outcome of these dual infections, such as that with PRRSV and influenza virus, varied strongly within and between experiments. Within experiments, the proportion of pigs that developed enhanced respiratory disease varied from 20 to 100%. The severity of respiratory disease and weight loss also differed strongly between experiments. Conventional pigs were affected more severely than caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs, which points towards a role of the sanitary status of pigs. Though our data support that interactions between respiratory viruses can aggravate respiratory disease in the field, experimental inoculations with PRRSV and PRCV or swine influenza virus lack the reproducibility that is required to study the pathogenesis of multifactorial respiratory disease. This is probably due to the fact that even a single experimental infection with respiratory viruses has intrinsic variation in virological, inflammatory and clinical parameters. A second infection will likely enhance this variation, as the outcome of the second infection is in part dependent on that of the first infection. We therefore chose to develop an alternative model consisting of a primary inoculation with PRRSV followed by a second inoculation with a non-replicating agent, namely LPS.",

In experimental infection studies, peak virus titers are obtained 7\u201310 days post-inoculation (DPI). PRRSV has a specific tropism for differentiated macrophages (Vanderheijden et al., 2003). Although not proven, several researchers suggest that destruction of lung macrophages by PRRSV is the key event in making the lungs susceptible for secondary invaders such as B. bronchiseptica or S. suis (Galina et al., 1994, Brockmeier et al., 2000). Indeed, in vitro infection of macrophages results in cell death within 48 h after inoculation (Suar\u00e9z et al., 1996, Oleksiewicz and Nielsen, 1999). Additionally, studies on lung tissue demonstrated that part of the macrophages surrounding infected cells undergo apoptosis (Sirinarumitr et al., 1998, Sur et al., 1998, Labarque et al., 2001, Labarque et al., 2003, Choi and Chae, 2002). Another study showed that the capacity of the lungs to clear copper particles from the blood was reduced during PRRSV infection, probably because of destruction of intravascular lung macrophages (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2000). All these studies are consistent with the idea that the non-specific host defence may be impaired in PRRSV-infected lungs. In our studies, however, we never found a decrease of the total number of alveolar macrophages in PRRSV-infected lungs (Labarque et al., 2000). On the contrary, the infection caused a 5-fold increase of the number of alveolar macrophages between 5 and 52 DPI. This increase was due to infiltration of blood monocytes, which are known to differentiate into macrophages. Another important finding is that at the most 3% of the bronchoalveolar (BAL) lavage cells are infected during virus replication in the lungs (Mengeling et al., 1995; Duan et al., 1997; Labarque et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The production of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs during PRRSV infection was studied intensively in our laboratory (Van Reeth et al., 1999, Labarque et al., 2003). IFN-\u03b1, IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 are important mediators of several infectious and inflammatory lung diseases (Bielefeldt-Ohmann, 1995, Murtaugh et al., 1996). They are among the first cytokines that are produced in the lungs during an infection. IFN-\u03b1 is a typical antiviral cytokine, which can activate macrophages and natural killer cells (Tizard, 1995). IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 cause infiltration and activation of leukocytes in the lungs, increased microvascular permeability and bronchoconstriction (Martin et al., 2001). They also induce a cascade of secondary cytokines, such as IL-6, a potent inducer of acute-phase proteins in the liver (Murtaugh et al., 1996). The production of these cytokines in the lungs has been associated with general signs of disease, such as fever, depression and anorexia. Besides proinflammatory cytokines, we also examined the production of IL-10. IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine capable of reducing the inflammatory response, suppressing among other things the production of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 (Steinhauser et al., 1999, Oberholzer et al., 2002). CDCD pigs were used to determine the profile of the respective cytokines during a PRRSV infection. Pigs were inoculated intranasally with PRRSV (106.0\n TCID50, Lelystad strain) at the age of 4\u20135 weeks and control pigs were left non-inoculated. IFN-\u03b1, IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 were quantified in the BAL fluids by specific bioassays, described in a previous paper (Van Reeth et al., 1999). IL-10 was quantified by an ELISA for porcine IL-10 (Biosource). The evolution of the virus titers and cytokine levels is presented in Fig. 1\n. The levels of two of the three proinflammatory cytokines were low or undetectable. IFN-\u03b1 was detected at very low levels (29\u2013168 U/ml) between 1 and 14 DPI and was undetectable thereafter. Bioactive TNF-\u03b1 was undetectable, except at 14 DPI when low amounts (32\u2013109 U/ml) were found. Only IL-1 was produced consistently from 1 (483 U/ml) to 52 DPI (256 U/ml). IL-1 levels peaked at 9 DPI (1265 U/ml), a time point which corresponds with the peak of virus replication in the lungs. IL-10 was detected from 5 (19 pg/ml) to 25 DPI (17 pg/ml) and the highest levels were also detected at 9 DPI (139 pg/ml). Both IL-1 and IL-10 levels were correlated well with each other and with PRRSV titers. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients (P\n < 0.05) ranged between 0.60 and 0.92. The uninfected control pigs were negative for all cytokines, except one pig which tested positive for IL-1 (71 U/ml).",

This is in contrast to other porcine respiratory viruses, such as swine influenza virus, which elicits 10 and 1000-fold higher levels of the respective cytokines in the lungs (Van Reeth et al., 1998). IL-10 concentrations have not been determined in the lungs of pigs infected with other viruses than PRRSV. It is unclear therefore whether the IL-10 production in the lungs is typical of PRRSV. Some authors speculate that PRRSV-induced IL-10 could have an anti-inflammatory or even immunosuppressive effect (Feng et al., 2003, Suradhat and Thanawongnuwech, 2003). However, such an effect of endogenous IL-10 has not yet been proven in vivo in large animal species.",

LPS was chosen because it is the main endotoxin and a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Pigs are likely to be exposed to LPS under farm conditions, as LPS is present in stable dust in concentrations up to several \u03bcg/m3 air (Rask-Andersen et al., 1989, Zhiping et al., 1996). Also, LPS is released at high concentrations in the lungs during pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria (Pugin et al., 1992). Treatment with antibiotics, especially those belonging to the \u03b2-lactam family, can induce sudden and massive release of LPS from the bacterial cell wall (Periti and Mazzei, 1999). LPS is one of the primary agents in organic dust that causes airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction (reviewed by Thorn (2001)). Adverse reactions after inhalation of LPS in stable dust, such as headache, coughing and decreased lung function, have been reported numerous times in farmers. Airborne LPS is considered an important factor of various inflammatory lung diseases of humans such as \u201cfarmer's lung disease\u201d and asthma.",

Macroscopic and microscopic lesions, number of inflammatory cells and proinflammatory cytokine levels in the lungs were compared between pigs inoculated with PRRSV + LPS, PRRSV only, LPS only and PBS. In this experiment, the interval between PRRSV and LPS inoculations ranged from 3 to 14 days. Pigs were euthanized 6 h after LPS. Again, the PRRSV\u2013LPS inoculated pigs developed severe respiratory disease, in contrast to the singly inoculated controls. PRRSV infection significantly enhanced cytokine production in response to LPS. Peak TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6 titers were 10\u2013100 times higher in PRRSV\u2013LPS inoculated pigs than in the singly PRRSV or LPS-inoculated pigs and they correlated with respiratory signs. Fig. 2a shows the respiratory scores and bioactive TNF-\u03b1 levels in the lung lavage fluids of pigs exposed to LPS at the different time intervals, ranging from 3 to 14 days, after PRRSV inoculation. The IL-1 and IL-6 levels are presented in detail in Van Gucht et al. (2003b). The clinical and cytokine synergy occurred at all intervals, but the highest cytokine titers were observed at 5\u201314 days after PRRSV inoculation. No cytokines were detected in the lungs of PBS-inoculated pigs. However, neutrophil infiltration, macroscopic and microscopic lesions in the lungs of PRRSV\u2013LPS inoculated pigs resembled the combined effects of the single PRRSV and LPS inoculations without synergy. The histological lung lesions of PRRSV-infected pigs were little aggravated by subsequent LPS exposure (described in Van Gucht et al. (2003b)). This suggests that the difficult breathing of PRRSV\u2013LPS inoculated pigs resulted from functional disturbances such as bronchoconstriction, rather than from structural lung damage.",

Pentoxifylline (Torental\u00ae, Hoechst) is a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 (Noel et al., 1990, Neuner et al., 1994). Pentoxifylline has been successfully used to suppress systemic TNF-\u03b1 levels in pigs (Gibson et al., 1991). Additionally, we have also examined the effects of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), namely meloxicam (Metacam\u00ae, Boehringer Ingelheim) and flunixin meglumine (Finadyne\u00ae, Schering-Plough). Both NSAIDs are registered to treat inflammation in swine. They inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which are eicosanoid mediators of inflammation (Odensvik et al., 1989, Schmidt and Banting, 2000, Hirsch et al., 2003).",

This suggests that other mechanisms may have contributed to the clinical improvement of pentoxifylline-treated pigs. Pentoxifylline can inhibit neutrophil adhesion and activation, improve blood perfusion and cause bronchodilatation (Tighe et al., 1990, Cortijo et al., 1993). Myers et al. (2002) studied the effect of pentoxifylline on acute pleuropneumonia caused by A. pleuropneumoniae in swine. They found that a dose of 20 mg/kg s.c. had no effect on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. Higher doses (200 mg/kg, s.c.) induced side effects such as vomiting, diarrhoea and tremor. Our results agree with those of Myers et al. (2002) in that pentoxifylline is probably not a good tool to study the role of proinflammatory cytokines in lung disease.",

            "text": "Recent research in our laboratory focused on the mechanisms by which PRRSV can sensitize the lungs for LPS (Van Gucht et al., 2003a, Van Gucht et al., 2005). The overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PRRSV\u2013LPS induced disease, but it is still unclear how PRRSV enhances cytokine production in response to LPS. A possible mechanism relates to the expression of the LPS receptor complex in the lungs. The biological effects of LPS depend on the binding to this complex. CD14, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are three major components of this complex (Heumann and Roger, 2002). CD14, also called the primary LPS receptor, is expressed on the membranes of monocytes, macrophages and to a lesser extent on neutrophils (Antal-Szalmas et al., 1997, Antal-Szalmas, 2000). CD14 is a so-called \u201cpattern recognition receptor\u201d. This is a receptor that recognizes conserved molecules of several pathogens, such as LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria and chitosan from fungi and insects, thereby initiating an inflammatory response against these organisms. Binding of LPS to CD14 can be enhanced by LBP, a soluble acute-phase protein produced by liver and lung epithelial cells (Fenton and Golenbock, 1998, Dentener et al., 2000). LBP increases the effect of LPS a 100-fold (Hailman et al., 1994). Finally, the CD14\u2013LPS complex binds to TLR4, which sends a danger signal towards the nucleus followed by transcription of inflammatory genes.",

As both CD14 and LBP are components of the LPS receptor complex, their massive increase in the lungs during a PRRSV infection may explain why PRRSV sensitizes the lungs for the production of proinflammatory cytokines upon exposure to LPS. The PRRSV infection sensitized the lungs for LPS as early as 3 DPI (see Fig. 2a and b). The present data therefore suggest that CD14, which was increased from 3 DPI onwards, may be more important for the synergy with LPS than LBP, which was increased only from 7 DPI onwards.",

PRRSV in itself was clearly a poor inducer of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1. We believe that this limited production of proinflammatory cytokines contributes to the lack of severe respiratory signs. Another important factor is that PRRSV does not replicate in or damage pneumocytes and endothelial cells, two cell types which are essential for normal gas exchange (Teifke et al., 2001, Howerth et al., 2002). Though a poor cytokine inducer as such, PRRSV sensitizes the lungs for the production of proinflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation. The acute overproduction of these cytokines probably plays a key role in the clinical signs. Treatment of PRRSV\u2013LPS inoculated pigs with pentoxifylline only moderately reduced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 levels and more specific cytokine inhibitors are needed to confirm the role of these cytokines in the acute respiratory disease.",

The increase of CD14 was mainly due to a massive influx of highly CD14-positive monocytes in the lung interstitium. It is likely that the increase of CD14 and, to a lesser extent LBP, sensitizes the lungs for LPS. CD14 not only acts as a receptor for LPS, but also for conserved molecules of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, such as peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid, leading to an activation of the innate immune response (Muhvic et al., 2001, Schroder et al., 2003). It is therefore possible that PRRSV also sensitizes the lungs for cell wall components other than LPS. Moreover, research indicates that LPS, peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid synergize in the induction of cytokines (De Kimpe et al., 1995, Wray et al., 2001). Stable dust contains a mixture of these molecules and the effect of LPS may be enhanced by other bacterial cell wall components (Zhiping et al., 1996).",

PRCV is, like PRRSV, a subclinical respiratory virus of swine and preliminary data suggest that a PRCV infection also increases CD14 expression in the lungs. The synergy with LPS is thus not unique for PRRSV and it may be a common feature of different respiratory viruses. However, PRRSV replicates for 5\u20137 weeks in the lungs, while PRCV replication lasts only 7\u201310 days. Therefore, interactions with LPS are more likely for PRRSV than for PRCV. There have been few studies on the interactions between other viruses and LPS in vivo. To our knowledge, PRRSV and PRCV are the first respiratory viruses that were shown to synergize with LPS in the induction of respiratory disease. Recently, it has been described that systemic infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus leads to fatal shock upon intraperitoneal inoculation with a sublethal dose of LPS (Nguyen and Biron, 1999, Nansen and Thomsen, 2001). The shock syndrome appeared to result from an overproduction of TNF-\u03b1. Studies with IFN knock-out mice indicated that virus-induced interferons, both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and -\u03b3, were responsible for the increased sensitivity to LPS (Doughty et al., 2001, Nansen and Thomsen, 2001). It is unlikely, however, that IFN-\u03b1 is involved in the sensitisation of PRRSV-infected pigs for LPS, because IFN-\u03b1 production is minimal during infection with PRRSV (Albina et al., 1998, Van Reeth et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The significance of the interaction between PRRSV and LPS in respiratory disease in the field is difficult to assess and may depend on several factors, such as the level of virus replication in the lungs and the level of LPS exposure. Exposure to LPS is variable and may depend on several factors, such as concentration of stable dust, load of Gram-negative bacteria in the lungs and use of antibiotics. In our experiments, LPS was administered to pigs at a dose of 20 \u03bcg/kg body weight. Assuming an environment with an endotoxin concentration of 5 \u03bcg/m3 air (Zhiping et al., 1996) and a respiratory volume of 0.3 m3/h, pigs of the same age as in our experimental model would be exposed to a total dose of airborne endotoxins of approximately 36 \u03bcg/day. Thus, one could argue that pigs in the field are exposed to lower doses of airborne LPS than those used experimentally. Unlike for humans, there are almost no epidemiological studies on the role of airborne LPS in respiratory disease of pigs (Jolie, 1998). LPS is not only inhaled with dust but also released locally in the lungs during an infection with Gram-negative bacteria. It was shown that at least part of the lung lesions and clinical signs of an infection with Gram-negative bacteria, such as A. pleuropneumoniae, are caused by the release of LPS from the bacterial cell wall (Udeze et al., 1987, Idris et al., 1993). In theory, any infection of the deeper lungs with Gram-negative bacteria has the potential of synergizing with PRRSV, if sufficient amounts of LPS are released. We ourselves did not perform dual inoculations with PRRSV and whole Gram-negative bacteria, but several groups were unable to demonstrate a clinical synergy between PRRSV and bacteria, like H. parasuis and P. multocida (Cooper et al., 1995, Carvalho et al., 1997, Solano et al., 1997). It should be mentioned, however, that bacteria could not be isolated from the lungs of most dually inoculated pigs in these studies. This means that there was no opportunity for an interaction between PRRSV and locally released LPS. Also, the biological activity of LPS, which is determined by the structure of the lipid A component, depends on the species of bacteria (Erridge et al., 2002). LPSs of E. coli or Salmonella spp., for example, have a stronger endotoxic activity than those of pseudomonas or Chlamydia spp.",

Respiratory scores range from 0 to 4, whereby 0 = normal; 1 = tachypnoea when stressed; 2 = tachypnoea at rest; 3 = tachypnoea and dyspnoea at rest; 4 = severe tachypnoea and dyspnoea with laboured, jerky breathing. Pigs inoculated with PRRSV only showed no respiratory signs (score 0) and had no detectable TNF-\u03b1, except at 14 DPI (32-109 U/ml) (see Fig. 1b).",
