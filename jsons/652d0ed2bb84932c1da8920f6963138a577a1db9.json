In particular, models using attention mechanism such as BERT have shown to have the capability of capturing the contextual information within a sentence or document. However, their ability of capturing the global information about the vocabulary of a language is more limited. This latter is the strength of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). In this paper, we propose VGCN-BERT model which combines the capability of BERT with a Vocabulary Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN). Local information and global information interact through different layers of BERT, allowing them to influence mutually and to build together a final representation for classification. In our experiments on several text classification datasets, our approach outperforms BERT and GCN alone, and achieve higher effectiveness than that reported in previous studies.",

By performing convolution operations on neighbor nodes in the graph, the representation of a word will incorporate those of the neighbors, allowing to integrate the global context of a domain-specific language to some extent. For example, the meaning of \"new\" can be related to that of \"innovation\" and \"surprised\" through the connections between them. However, GCNs that only take into account the global vocabulary information may fail to capture local information (such as word order), which is very important in understanding the meaning of a sentence.

We first construct a graph convolutional network on the vocabulary graph based on the word co-occurrence information, which aims at encoding the global information of the language, then feed the graph embedding and word embedding together to a self-attention encoder in BERT. The word embedding and graph embedding then interact with each other through the self-attention mechanism while learning the classifier. This way, the classifier can not only make use of both local information and global information, but also allow them to guide each other via the attention mechanism so that the final representation built up for classification will integrate gradually both local and global information. We also expect that the connections between words in the initial vocabulary graph can be spread to more complex expressions in the sentence through the layers of self-attention.",

[27] , have greatly improved the performance in text classification tasks. The representation of a word acquired through self-attention can incorporate the relationship between the word and all other words in a sentence by fusing the representations of the latter. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) [8] , which leverages a multi-layer multi-head self-attention (called transformer) together with a positional word embedding, is one of the most successful deep neural network model for text classification in the past years. The attention mechanism in each layer of the encoder enhances the new representation of the input data with contextual information by paying multi-head attentions to different parts of the text. A pre-trained BERT model based on 800M words from BooksCorpus and 2,500M words from English Wikipedia is made available. It has also been widely used in many NLP tasks, and has proven effective. However, as most of other attention-based deep neural networks, BERT mainly focuses on local consecutive word sequences, which provides local context information. That is, a word is placed in its context, and this generates a contextualized representation. However, it may be difficult for BERT to account for the global information of a language.",

In terms of convolution, Text GCN uses the same algorithm as GCN. GCN and its variants are good at convolving the global information in the graph into a sentence, but they do not take into account local information such as the order between words. When word order and other local information are important, GCN may be insufficient. Therefore, it is natural to combine GCN with a model capturing local information such as BERT.",

We believe that a vocabulary graph can still provide additional information given the fact that the connections between words observed in word embeddings are limited within a small text window (usually 5 words). Long-range connections are missing. In addition, by building a vocabulary graph on an application-specific document collection, one can capture application-dependent dependencies, in addition to the general dependencies in the pre-trained models.",

Any vocabulary graph can be used to complement BERT (e.g. Wordnet). In this paper, we consider a graph constructed using word co-occurrences with documents. Local information from a text is captured by BERT. The interaction between them is achieved by first selecting the relevant part of the global vocabulary graph according to the input sentence and transforming it into an embedding representation. We use multiple layers of attention mechanism on concatenated representation of input text and the graph. These processes are illustrated in Fig. 1 . We will provide more details in the following subsections. 12 Layers of Self Attention 1th 12th Fig. 1 . Illustration of VGCN-BERT. The embeddings of input sentence (Phase 1) are combined with the vocabulary graph (Phase 2) to produce a graph embedding, which is concatenated to the input sentence (Phase 3). Note that from the vocabulary graph, only the part relevant to the input is extracted and embedded. In Phase 4, several layers of self-attention are applied to the concatenated representation, allowing interactions between word embeddings and graph embedding. The final embedding at the last layer is fed in a fully connected layer (Phase 5) for classification.",
