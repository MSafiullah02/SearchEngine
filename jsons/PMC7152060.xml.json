A cycle comprising a quiescent phase (lasting approximately 1 hour), phase two comprising minor contractile activity (15 to 40 minutes), and then migrating myoelectric (motor) complexes (MMCs) (4 to 8 minutes), and is repeated approximately every 3 hours. The short MMC phase is a period of intense contractile activity that sweeps undigested food, secretions, desquamated cells, and bacteria down the intestine. This process is known as the intestinal housekeeper wave and is induced by motilin secretion. Erythromycin can stimulate motilin receptors and at low doses it can be prokinetic mimicking the MMC; higher doses overstimulate and may cause emesis. The pattern of intestinal motility in cats is somewhat different, but a migrating spike complex correlates with the MMC.",

Furthermore there is emerging evidence that ileal biopsies are more likely to be diagnostic than duodenal. As expected, fewer biopsies are needed to reliably detect architectural changes the better their quality (i.e., better size, depth, and integrity) and more specimens are needed the deeper the lesion. Therefore the clinician should always interpret endoscopic biopsy results cautiously; results should be questioned if the tissue diagnosis does not fit the clinical picture, or if the response to apparently appropriate therapy is poor. In some cases, repeat biopsy (e.g., by exploratory laparotomy) may be required. Cytologic examination of endoscopic biopsy squash preparations or mucosal brushings are only an adjunct to histopathologic examination.",

Briefly, the intestinal mucosa has a barrier function (\u201cimmune exclusion\u201d), and controls exposure of antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which must generate protective immune responses against pathogens while remaining \u201ctolerant\u201d of harmless environmental antigens such as commensal bacteria and food. IBD develops when the normal decision-making process breaks down, leading to inappropriate immune responses and uncontrolled inflammation. Critical to the development of inflammation is a breakdown in tolerance to normal luminal antigens (particularly endogenous bacterial species). This loss of tolerance may result from disruption of the mucosal barrier leading to excessive antigen exposure to the underlying immune system, from dysregulation of normal mucosal immune system function, or from a combination of these processes. The end effect is uncontrolled inflammation, which is the result of activation of the many effector pathways. The inflammation can then lead to architectural disruption, resulting in adverse effects on function, which depend upon the part of the bowel affected.",

For example, increased CIBDAI has been seen in dogs with food-responsive conditions, and values decreased on successful treatment.29 More recently, a variation of CIBDAI, the canine chronic enteropathy activity index (CCEAI; see Table 57-3) was proposed.18 All of the same signs are scored as for the CIBDAI, but additional characteristics are also assessed (e.g., presence of ascites and/or peripheral edema, pruritus, and serum protein concentrations). A recent study shows that this correlates better with prognosis than the CIBDAI18; however, the advantage of improved performance may be offset by the requirement for blood sampling and serum albumin measurement. Time will tell which system is preferred by clinicians and researchers. Finally, an activity index for feline IBD (FIBDAI) was proposed, which makes use of histology, GI signs, serum total protein and phosphorous concentrations, serum alkaline phosphatase concentration, and endoscopic lesions.30\n",

Fat restriction was traditionally recommended because of concerns over malabsorption, meaning that unassimilated fatty acids could be available for hydroxylation, thus stimulating electrolyte secretion. However, the need for fat restriction has recently been challenged as most cases can tolerate a higher dietary fat content, and fat restriction may exacerbate existing weight loss. Modification of the n3:n6 fatty acid ratio may also modulate the inflammatory response and have some benefit in treatment and maintenance of remission.57, 58 However, there have been no studies done to prove a benefit of such modification in canine IBD.",

However, its activity may show a delayed onset (up to 3 weeks) and, given its myelosuppressive potential, regular hematologic monitoring is necessary. Azathioprine is not recommended for cats, largely because cats have very low activities of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), the major enzyme involved in the degradation of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), the active metabolite of azathioprine. Chlorambucil (2 to 6 mg/m2 PO q24h until remission, then tapering) is a better choice of a cytotoxic immunosuppressive agent in cats. A combination of prednisolone and chlorambucil can also be effective for alimentary lymphoma in cats, and is particularly suitable for use when differentiation of severe IBD from lymphoma has been problematic.",

A recent uncontrolled study also shows that cyclosporine (5 mg/kg q24h PO) may be effective in IBD, which is refractory to steroid therapy.66 Most dogs achieved either complete or partial remission, and response correlated with reductions in both CIBDAI and mucosal T-lymphocyte numbers; however, no change in histopathology score was noted. The favorable response came at a cost, with side effects (including vomiting, gingival ulceration, alopecia) occurring in almost half of the dogs.",

Villus atrophy is caused by loss of enterocytes, decreased precursors in intestinal crypts, infiltrative disease causing villus fusion, and mechanical destruction of the absorptive surface area (e.g., massive gastric acid emptying into the intestine with gastrinoma). Enterocytes can be damaged by bacteria (e.g., damage to the microvillar membrane) or can be immature and poorly functional as a result of accelerated turnover. Infiltrates of the mucosa can affect mucosal permeability, villus structure and function, and lymphatic flow; therefore the host's immune system may be integral to the ultimate severity of the intestinal lesion. Intestinal pathology from any number of causes might allow otherwise normal luminal bacteria to proliferate or persist, in turn causing worsening of enterocyte damage and/or more mucosal inflammation. Finally, animals severely malnourished and protein-deficient from the intestinal disease may have a more difficult time repairing intestinal damage.

Advantages of endoscopy include its ease, noninvasive nature, ability to detect mucosal lesions allowing one to direct the biopsy to those areas, and ability to take multiple samples from one area.16 The major disadvantages of endoscopy are that it does not allow access to the mid-jejunum, and nondiagnostic tissue samples may be obtained if the operator was not trained properly. Superficial samples (e.g., villus tips only) or compressed lacteals (Figure 57-16\n) may be obtained with all too vigorous handling of the endoscopic biopsy forceps. Surgery and laparoscopy provide ready access to the mid-jejunum (which endoscopy seldom can reach) and facilitate tissue sampling that will detect submucosal lesions. Surgery also permits biopsy of mesenteric lymph nodes. Surgical and laparoscopic biopsy are more invasive, have greater risk for morbidity and mortality from dehiscence,17 are more expensive, do not reliably detect mucosal lesions (which means you may have biopsied the wrong site), do not guarantee a diagnosis, and generally require removal of ascites. The latter intervention has the possibility of lowering body albumin content further still, making it all the easier for ascites to quickly reform. Furthermore, untrained individuals can easily take nondiagnostic full-thickness biopsies.",

Sometimes an obvious white fluid is released as biopsies are taken, which is chyle being released from lacteals that are ruptured during the biopsy process.2 There are at least two significant problems with histologic diagnosis of lymphangiectasia. First, the lesions may be localized to one section of the gut (e.g., lymphangiectasia is found in the ileum but not the duodenum). Second, lesions may be relatively localized to the deeper layers of the intestine (e.g., the border between the mucosa and the submucosa) and can only be found with full-thickness biopsies.

Even then, the subsequent rise in serum albumin tends to be transient because the administered albumin is all too quickly lost from the body. Generally ascites should not be removed unless it is causing a substantial problem (e.g., diaphragmatic compression and dyspnea). Removing ascites removes albumin as well as fluid, which ultimately lowers the total body albumin concentration, making it easier for ascites to reform. To lessen ascites, one may administer hetastarch IV (10 to 20 mL/kg), which hopefully stays in the intravascular compartment longer than albumin because of its size, thereby drawing third space fluid into the intravascular compartment. Although one may administer furosemide (2 to 4 mg/kg BID-TID) to lessen ascites, it is best to administer moderate doses. Massive doses of diuretics can deplete the intravascular compartment and cause hypovolemia. In emergency situations (e.g., severe dyspnea as a consequence of pressure on the diaphragm), an abdominocentesis can be performed but only to remove sufficient fluid to alleviate the dyspnea. Patients should be monitored for hypomagnesemia, which can complicate cases and worsen hypocalcemia. If magnesium supplementation is necessary, a continuous rate infusion of MgSO4 in 5% dextrose in water (35 to 50 mg/kg/day) is preferred. Orally administered magnesium tends to act as a laxative.",

Dogs are infected by ingestion of larvae in the environment, skin penetration, ingestion of larvae during nursing, or ingestion of infected paratenic hosts (usually rodents). Cats are infected similarly but do not have transmammary infection. After transmammary infection in dogs, cutaneous infection, and ingestion of larvae, some larvae migrate to the lungs via the systemic circulation and molt to fourth-stage larvae in the bronchi and trachea. The larvae are then coughed up, swallowed, and develop into adults in the SI. Some larvae invade muscle tissue where they undergo arrested development (hypobiosis) and can be maintained for months to years. Upon reactivation, during stressful events like pregnancy, these larvae resume migration and reenter the intestine or concentrate in the mammary tissues of dogs and infect subsequent litters. Ingestion of infected paratenic hosts leads only to intestinal infections in dogs or cats. Puppies infected with A. caninum by nursing can shed eggs as soon as 10 days after birth. The prepatent periods for A. braziliense, and U. stenocephala are 13 to 27 days.

Histopathologically, infected animals show loss of intestinal microvilli, degeneration of host epithelial cells, villus atrophy, and lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltration.37, 44 It is possible that susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis in animals could have a genetic component as suggested for humans.45, 46\n",

Modified acid-fast staining of a thin fecal smear can be performed to aid in the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium spp. are generally the only enteric organism of the appropriate size that stains pink to red with acid-fast stain. However, acid-fast staining only detects approximately 70% of Cryptosporidium spp.\u2013infected animals when a single sample is tested.48 Fecal antigen tests for Cryptosporidium spp. are available for use with human feces, but results of these assays have been variable when applied to feces from infected animals.48, 49, 50 Fecal antigen assays are based on antibodies against C. parvum and high false-negative rates may reflect antigenic differences between C. parvum, C. felis, and C. canis. Fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies react with Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts (Merifluor IFA, Meridian Biosciences, Cincinnati, OH). In limited studies, this assay appears to detect both Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. isolates from dogs and cats.22, 26, 48 PCR is currently available to detect Cryptosporidium spp. DNA in canine or feline feces and is more sensitive than immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in feline studies.22, 26, 51 PCR products can be evaluated by genetic sequencing to further determine what Cryptosporidium spp. is associated with the infection (Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Colorado State University, Ft. Collins; http://dlab.colostate.edu/). Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts or DNA can be detected in normal dogs and cats, consequently positive test results do not prove a disease association.",

More than 100 compounds have been used in attempts to treat Cryptosporidium spp. infections in mammals and no compound is consistently effective.52, 53, 54 There have been essentially no controlled treatment studies in dogs or cats and all protocols should be considered empirical. Cryptosporidium spp.\u2013associated diarrhea in pets sometimes resolves after administration of tylosin (10 to 15 mg/kg PO q12h), azithromycin (10 mg/kg PO daily), paromomycin (150 mg/kg PO q12-24h), or nitazoxanide (25 mg/kg PO q12-24h). It is unlikely that tylosin has anti-Cryptosporidium effects and so cases with apparent responses may relate to the antibiotic or antiinflammatory effects of the drug. Tylosin and nitazoxanide are GI irritants. Paromomycin can be nephrotoxic in cats if absorbed and has had variable results in humans with cryptosporidiosis.55, 56, 57 If the cat or dog shows clinical improvement within the first 7 days of therapy and toxicity has not been noted, treatment should be continued for 1 week past clinical resolution of diarrhea. Some cats with Cryptosporidium spp. infection, with or without Giardia coinfection, have required several weeks of treatment prior to resolution of diarrhea. The role of fiber, silymarin, or probiotics in addition to antimicrobial therapy is unknown at this time. Some cats and dogs with resistant cryptosporidiosis have underlying diseases (e.g., IBD, T. foetus, and immunodeficiency syndromes) and the diagnostic workup should be continued if therapeutic failures occur. No drug treatment has been shown to consistently eliminate Cryptosporidium spp. infections. Thus the primary goal for the treatment of dogs or cats with cryptosporidiosis is to eliminate diarrhea. As infection is unlikely to be eliminated, following results of Cryptosporidium spp. diagnostic tests in normal animals seems to have little clinical utility.",

It is likely that sensitivities vary amongst different isolates and it is currently impossible to predict which anti-Giardia drug will be effective in an individual case. Although there have been multiple drugs used for the treatment of giardiasis in dogs and cats, there are few studies that utilized dose titrations and evaluation of drugs in experimentally infected animals. In most studies, fecal samples were only assessed for short periods of time after treatment and neither was immune suppression induced nor necropsy performed to evaluate whether infection was eliminated or merely suppressed. Infection with Giardia does not appear to cause permanent immunity and so reinfection can occur, a finding that also hampers assessment of treatment studies.",

Others only resort to combination therapy if there is evidence of a persistent infection that is not cleared by monotherapy. If the first drug fails to control diarrhea and the organism is still detected in feces, a second drug from an alternate class is indicated. The addition of fiber to the diet may help control clinical signs of giardiasis in some animals by helping to suppress bacterial overgrowth or by inhibiting organismal attachment to intestinal microvilli. Immunotherapy with the Giardia vaccine has aided in eliminating cyst shedding and diarrhea in some infected dogs.88 However, in a controlled study in 16 experimentally infected cats, vaccination as immunotherapy was ineffective with one strain of Giardia.89 In addition, both commercial products have been discontinued. Probiotic administration has been promoted as potentially beneficial in the control of giardiasis. In one study, dogs treated with silymarin and metronidazole had superior clinical responses to dogs treated with metronidazole alone.90 However, in another study, administration of a commercially available probiotic (Forta-Flora, Nestle Purina PetCare, St. Louis, MO) did not affect the outcome of Giardia infection.91 In one study, bathing the dog on the last day of treatment was a beneficial adjunct therapy.77 In dogs and cats with persistent diarrhea and Giardia spp. infection, a more extensive workup to attempt to diagnose other underlying diseases is indicated if several therapeutic trials fail. Common underlying disorders include cryptosporidiosis, T. foetus in cats, IBD, bacterial overgrowth, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and immunodeficiencies.",

However, some dogs and cats are infected with the zoonotic assemblages and the same assemblage has been detected in dogs and people in the same family.92, 93, 94, 95 All healthy dogs and cats should be screened for hookworm and roundworm infection once or twice yearly as previously discussed. Thus healthy dogs and cats that are harboring Giardia cysts will be detected. As some Giardia spp. may be zoonotic, treatment of healthy infected animals should be considered with each owner. Treatment of healthy animals is controversial because all of the drugs can potentially cause side effects, animals with normal stools are not considered human health risks, treatment is unlikely to eliminate infection, and reinfection can occur within days. For example, in a study of naturally infected dogs, approximately 15% of treated dogs were still Giardia infected when rechecked 9 or 16 days after treatment.76 In another study, 50% of the healthy, Giardia-positive dogs had adverse reactions to fenbendazole or nitazoxanide and 62.5% of those that successfully completed therapy were positive for Giardia cyst or antigen on day 34.64 It is unknown whether these infections were not eliminated or if the dogs were reinfected. If treatment is deemed appropriate by the clinician and pet owner, many clinicians currently recommend administration of a 5-day course of fenbendazole in apparently healthy dogs and cats that test positive for Giardia. The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) Advisory Panel on Zoonoses recommends attempting to remove the source of infection during the treatment period and performing a fecal centrifugal flotation after Giardia treatment one time, within 2 to 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period (www.aafponline.org). If the animal is healthy and negative for cysts, retesting is not indicated again until the next scheduled fecal flotation. Currently it is not recommended that the IFA or fecal PCR assays be used as a recheck test for any of the Giardia antigen assays. It is currently unknown how long Giardia antigens will persist in feces after successful treatment.",

In one study of dogs experimentally infected with I. canis, the mean prepatent period was 9.8 days (range: 9 to 11 days, n = 22 dogs), the patent period was 8.9 days (range: 7 to 18 days, n = 20 dogs), and all of the puppies developed diarrhea, suggesting the organism can be a primary pathogen.98 In contrast, the prepatent period for I. ohioensis in one study was 6 to 7 days and diarrhea was variable.97 Numbers of oocysts shed in infected animals can vary dramatically.97, 98 Depending on the environmental conditions, sporulation can occur in as little as 12 hours. Clinical disease is most common in young, debilitated, and immunocompromised animals. All of the Isospora spp. replicate in the SI but the regions with the heaviest infection varies by the species.

The snail releases free-living cercariae that penetrate the skin of salmon, lose their tails, and become metacercariae that develop in a number of tissues of the salmon with heavy concentrations in the kidneys, liver, heart, and tail. The life cycle is completed when the adult trematode develops in the intestine of mammals or birds that eat fish. The syndrome has also been induced in dogs that have been fed infected snails. N. helminthoeca survives through all stages of the trematode. The adult flukes develop deep within the intestinal tissues causing local edema and inflammation in 5 to 6 days. The fluke releases N. helminthoeca, which infects intestinal histiocytes and disseminates in blood and lymph to lymphoid tissues. Mesenteric lymph nodes enlarge greatly from edema and an influx of inflammatory cells. Diarrhea results from the inflammation of intestinal lymphoid tissues and can be hemorrhagic.

When luminal contents are sampled and conventional bacterial culture techniques are used, common species include Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Clostridium sp., and Bacteroides sp., with a greater proportion of obligate anaerobic bacteria being reported in cats than in dogs. However, greater diversity can be seen when mucosal populations are assessed in addition to luminal contents.1 Recent studies employing newer techniques (e.g., sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, fluorescence in-situ hybridization), demonstrate that conventional techniques underestimate the true complexity of the bacterial flora because a significant number of bacterial species do not grow.2, 3 By conventional techniques, the total upper small intestinal bacterial counts of healthy cats range from 102 to 108 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and are higher than those reported in humans (<103, 4, 5 CFU/mL).4 However, there is no clear consensus as to what constitutes a \u201cnormal\u201d SI population in healthy dogs, and some studies suggest that healthy dogs can harbor up to 109 CFU/mL bacteria in the proximal SI.5, 6 Therefore, when using conventional culture techniques, the \u201ccutoff\u201d for normal flora in dogs and cats cannot be extrapolated from humans. Furthermore, clinicians must realize that numbers are likely to be greater, when taking into account the species that cannot be cultured by conventional means. The SI flora is relatively resistant to dietary changes; studies using different diets, or the addition of fructooligosaccharides to the diet have failed to demonstrate significant effects on the number or type of bacteria in the proximal SI of dogs and cat,7, 8 although some effects have been demonstrated on the colonic flora in cats.9\n",

Beneficial effects include inhibition of the growth of bacterial pathogens (by producing antimicrobial factors, occupying receptor sites, and competing for nutrients), facilitating digestion and absorption of various nutrients, synthesizing vitamins, and stimulating immune function.10 Health-negative effects include intestinal putrefaction, production of carcinogens, hepatic damage, and clinical signs such as diarrhea and constipation. In addition, studies implicate the intestinal flora in the development of obesity in humans.11 Finally, loss of immunologic tolerance to the normal bacterial flora has been implicated in the development of chronic intestinal inflammation, abnormal intestinal function, and perhaps even neoplasia.

In humans, SIBO arises secondary to a number of underlying disorders that interfere with the control mechanisms (as described previously). Although the existence of this condition in humans is not disputed, its existence in canine patients has been a subject of much controversy. By conventional methods of microbial culture in humans, SIBO is diagnosed when upper small intestinal bacterial numbers exceed 105 or 104 CFU/mL of intestinal juice for total bacteria and obligate anaerobes, respectively. Although these values were initially adopted for dogs, a number of studies suggest a larger microbial population (e.g., 107 CFU/mL or greater) in asymptomatic dogs.6 Small intestinal bacterial numbers are also greater in cats. Therefore the current diagnostic criteria for SIBO in companion animals are inappropriate, and may lead to misdiagnosis in many cases. Nonetheless, a genuine bacterial overgrowth may exist in conditions equivalent to those in humans, and it is appropriate to use the term SIBO in such circumstances.",

As in humans, therefore, canine SIBO is best viewed as a clinical sign or pathogenetic mechanism rather than a diagnosis in its own right.

There may also be similarities with the recently reported \u201ctylosin-responsive diarrhea\u201d (see later).16 Recent hypotheses on pathogenesis suggest that host\u2013bacterial interactions may be important. In this respect, ARD may develop secondary to defects in the mucosal barrier, aberrant mucosal immune responses, qualitative changes in the enteric bacterial flora, or a triangulation of these mechanisms. Defects in the mucosal barrier are supported by studies documenting abnormal permeability and the presence of brush-border enzyme defects.13, 14 A further extension of the hypothesis of defective mucosal barrier is the suggested association with IgA deficiency or dysregulation.17 Some, but not all, reports suggest that German Shepherd dogs with intestinal disease may have defective small intestinal IgA production, although mucosal IgA+ plasma cell numbers in affected dogs are either normal or increased.18 However, IgA deficiency has not consistently been identified in German Shepherd dogs,19, 20 and the pathogenesis may be more complex. Recent studies suggest differences in relative expression of allelic variants of the IgA heavy gene in various dog breeds including German Shepherd dogs.21, 22 However, there is no clear association between the different allelic variants and the manifestation of GI disease.23\n",

Indirect evidence for this hypothesis comes from the findings that dogs with ARD have increased lamina propria CD4+ T cells and increased expression of certain cytokines.18, 24 Such a hypothesis is supported by the fact that antibacterial agents lead to resolution of clinical signs, and decreased cytokine expression, but not a decline in bacterial numbers.24 That the most effective antibacterials are those with immune-modulating properties (e.g., oxytetracycline, metronidazole, tylosin) may support this hypothesis. A final possibility is that the condition arises from defective acquired immune responses to an occult infectious agent (e.g., enteropathogenic E. coli or Clostridium species). Therefore the predisposition of German Shepherd dogs to this syndrome could be explained by genetic susceptibility to infection as a result of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression. In this respect, there could be similarities in pathogenesis with histiocytic ulcerative colitis in Boxer dogs.25\n",

In addition, there was complete resolution of signs while on tylosin and, in many cases, relapse occurred upon discontinuation of therapy. The main difference from the classical description of idiopathic ARD was that a range of ages of dog was represented, and a mixed-pattern diarrhea noted. However, its true idiopathic nature was not demonstrated, as detailed diagnostics were lacking in many cases.

If a partial obstruction is the cause of a secondary SIBO, the history often involves relapsing small intestinal diarrhea, weight loss, and a favorable response to antibacterial therapy; the intermittent clinical signs in such cases are thought to be the result of the recurrent diarrhea temporarily flushing out the overgrowth.

An increase in small intestinal bacterial numbers has been documented in experimentally induced EPI, although bacterial numbers decrease upon treatment of the EPI with enzyme replacement.28 Therefore in many cases the SIBO itself is of no significance. However, a proportion of naturally occurring EPI cases respond suboptimally to pancreatic enzyme supplementation alone, and may require concurrent antibiotic therapy.

However, measurements of these parameters have poor sensitivity and specificity for canine SIBO, and cannot differentiate dogs with ARD from those with other etiologies.12 Consequently the use of folate and cobalamin measurements for the diagnosis of SIBO, and especially ARD, is questionable.

Furthermore, some authors question whether oxytetracycline should be used at all because it is associated with rapid development of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance.34 However, given that long-term efficacy is maintained in most cases, oxytetracycline may not be acting through its antibacterial properties as it does not significantly reduce SI bacterial numbers.24 Instead, it may either provide a selective pressure on the intestinal flora encouraging the establishment of less harmful bacteria or utilize immunomodulatory effects, which this antibiotic group possesses. Immunomodulatory activities also have been suggested for other antibacterials, namely metronidazole and tylosin, that are commonly used to treat ARD.

In addition, restricting fat may make it difficult for a cachectic patient to gain body weight and condition. Other suggestions include adding prebiotics (e.g., fructooligosaccharides) to the diet. Although these can modulate colonic microflora,9 the effect on small intestinal bacteria is questionable8 and there is limited current evidence for efficacy in clinical cases.

The most common sites in the dog are the ileocolic junction or jejunojejunum, whereas in cats, jejunojejunal is the most common type.7, 8, 9 In general, an intussusception occurs when a migrating peristaltic wave reaches a fixed or noncontractile segment (labeled A in Figure 57-20\n). If the fixed or noncontractile segment is of sufficient diameter, and of sufficient length, then the proximal contracted segment will fold into the outer intussuscipiens (Figure 57-21\n). The majority of intussusceptions develops aborally in the direction of normal peristalsis, but can develop in an orad, or retrograde, direction (Figure 57-22\n). Alternatively, an intraluminal, or extraluminal linear fixed linkage such as a short linear foreign body, can result in formation of a kink in the wall, which progresses to a fold and then intussusception.10\n",

Within 2 to 3 hours, however, hypermotility extends proximally to the duodenum, and hypomotility extends distally from the obstruction to the terminal ileum. Following occlusion of the small intestinal lumen, continued peristaltic activity proximally leads to transient increases in intraluminal pressure.

The net effect of these changes is an increase in wall stiffness, loss of slow-wave activity, reduced neural responses, and reduced contractile capacity. In chronic partial obstruction, wall stress and strain rise significantly proximal to the obstruction as a bolus is advanced by peristalsis. Mechanoreceptor stimulation triggers further increases in pressure to force the chyme through the obstruction. This may lead to localized luminal bulging. Most of this remodeling and degeneration is reversible over time once the obstruction has been removed, although neuronal degeneration may be irreversible and hypomotility may persist in some patients, particularly in more chronic cases.22\n",

Nonetheless, vomiting is the most common presenting sign in both dogs and cats. When absorptive capacity is preserved oral to the site of the obstruction, fluid losses in vomitus may not be as severe. In general, it appears that more distal obstructions (e.g., jejunal) are associated with a lower frequency of vomiting than are seen with proximal obstructions (e.g., duodenal).24 Proximal obstructions generally result in the loss of large amounts of ingested and secreted intestinal fluid. The duration of vomiting prior to presentation for a complete obstruction is usually 2 to 3 days, but partial obstructions can cause chronic intermittent vomiting for many weeks or months.1, 33, 35 Thus intestinal foreign bodies are an important differential for patients presenting with a history of acute or chronic vomiting.",

BIPSs are administered as capsules or mixed with food, thus avoiding the difficulties of administration of liquid barium. Unlike liquid barium, BIPS transit more closely approximates the transit of food in the GI tract. In cats and dogs that present for chronic vomiting or diarrhea, one protocol is to (a) administer the BIPS with food, (b) take radiographs 2 hours later to rule out gastric dumping, and (c) take radiographs at 8 hours to detect delayed gastric emptying. If the radiographs taken at 8 hours do not reveal some large spheres in the colon, a third set of radiographs later that same day or early the next morning should be taken to rule out partial bowel obstructions. Persistent bunching of the spheres in the SI is highly suggestive of physical obstruction of the small bowel, particularly if the markers have bunched in a dilated loop of SI or if \u201cgraveling\u201d is apparent. If the small bowel loop in which the bunching occurs is not dilated or graveling is not apparent, a repeat radiograph should be taken 1 or 2 hours later to ensure persistence of the bunching.",

Rapid intervention improves the prognosis, although many patients do require preoperative stabilization. Establishment of adequate tissue perfusion by correcting dehydration is essential and of paramount concern. Volume resuscitation should continue until there is evidence of normal tissue perfusion, stabilization of central venous and arterial blood pressure, and urine production. In most cases, this can be adequately achieved using routine crystalloid replacement principles and therapy. Normal saline (0.9%) is reserved for cases of known hypochloridemic alkalemia because of its acidifying effects when administered in large volumes. The value of colloid solutions is still unsettled. In an experimental model of acute intestinal obstruction in dogs, the administration of synthetic colloid reduced loss of fluid into the intestinal lumen when compared with crystalloids.47 This effect was consistent with a transient increase in plasma oncotic pressure. Nonetheless, evidence of improved outcome has not yet been provided in clinical patients, and the choice of crystalloids or colloids should be individualized according to evidence of low oncotic pressure and cost. A suggested approach is to start with crystalloid therapy, and administer a colloid solution if adequate perfusion and normotension cannot be achieved or maintained. In the face of severe hypotension (e.g., <60 mm Hg) or hypoalbuminemia, crystalloids, colloids, and plasma, may have to be administered concurrently.",

These events tend to move the material in an aborad direction. Short-segment peristalsis of the bowel is the norm in dogs and cats (see Figure 57-27). If short-segment peristalses occur sequentially they can propel a bolus the entire length of the gut in a short period of time.

There are more than 400 breeds of dogs recognized worldwide and 156 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club. Among these various dog breeds, several important differences in metabolism have been noted, for example, P-glycoprotein\u2013mediated metabolism, copper storage, and growth rates.4, 5 Differences in GI transit characteristics have also been noted. The GI tract of large-breed dogs (e.g., those weighing 60 kg) comprises 2.8% of their total body weight. In contrast, it comprises 7% of the total body weight of small-breed dogs (e.g., those weighing 5 kg). Breed-related differences in fecal water content could reflect differences in GI transit time, intestinal fermentation, diet, metabolism, and drug absorption. Using radiopaque markers (1.5-mm diameter administered in food), 12-week-old large-breed puppies (e.g., Great Danes) exhibited a significantly longer orocecal transit time (3.4 hours) as compared with small-breed puppies (e.g., Miniature Poodle, 2.5 hours). The longer transit time appears to reflect both a longer gastric emptying time and a longer small intestinal transit time among breeds. There also appear to be differences in intestinal permeability between dog breeds. The lactulose/rhamnose ratio reflects the relative absorption across the intestinal tight junction (transcellular absorption) versus the intestinal surface area (paracellular absorption, which occurs across the cell membrane of the enterocyte). The lactulose/rhamnose ratio is substantially greater in the Greyhound breed than in the Golden Retriever breed. Breed and age characteristics must be taken into account when differentiating normal and abnormal transit times. Chapter 26 outlines transit study techniques and times in more detail.",

Opioids are a mainstay in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Although opioids are very effective for pain relief from cancer and other nonmalignant diseases, their use is often limited by side effects. The most common adverse side effects are constipation and vomiting, but they also alter small bowel function causing opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can occur immediately after the first dose and persist for the duration of therapy. The peripherally acting \u00b5-receptor antagonists methylnaltrexone and alvimopan are a new class of agents designed to reverse opioid-induced side effects on the GI tract without compromising pain relief.30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36\n",

Pseudoobstruction can also arise secondary to other underlying disorders, such as progressive systemic sclerosis, amyloidosis, muscular dystrophy, generalized neuromuscular diseases, endocrinopathies, infectious disease, and drug toxicity.40\n",

Two dogs had atrophy of the muscularis externa but not fibrosis, either with or without mononuclear cell infiltration, whereas one dog had hyperplasia of the circular muscle without atrophy, fibrosis, or inflammation. In only two reported dogs with pseudoobstruction was the pathology described as primarily affecting the circular or longitudinal smooth muscle. Only two reports mention myocyte vacuolar degeneration, but it was not a prominent feature and marked myenteric plexus vacuolar degeneration was present, suggesting an underlying primary neuropathy. One of the cats reported with pseudoobstruction actually had diffuse intestinal lymphosarcoma with no additional histopathologic details.",

When the prevalence of FeLV was high, the most common presentation of feline lymphoma was of cranial mediastinal and multicentric disease in young, FeLV-positive cats, whereas now the most common presentation is of an older, serologically FeLV-negative cat with alimentary lymphoma.18, 34\n",

This reduced ability to delineate an abdominal mass on plain films in patients with lymphoma is likely caused by numerous factors including the potential for diffuse lesions and/or the presence of peritoneal effusion and/or other organ involvement. The frequency of obstructive patterns noted on plain films in dogs and cats with intestinal neoplasia varies between studies. Because of the advent of, and widespread use of, abdominal ultrasound, use of contrast radiography has waned in the last 5 to 10 years, but this technique will find filling defects in approximately 50% to 90% of dogs or cats with intestinal neoplasia.9, 24 Three-view thoracic radiographs should be performed as part of routine staging in any case with an abdominal mass or strong suspicion of an abdominal mass. As many intestinal tumors often do not metastasize to the lungs, this is typically a low-yield procedure when staging for small intestinal neoplasia. Nevertheless it should be performed as the presence of metastasis would signal a very significant change in prognosis and therapy.",

Abdominal ultrasound is a much more sensitive diagnostic tool than radiography for the identification of an intestinal mass12, 13, 16, 26, 77; however, abdominal ultrasound alone is not diagnostic. The most frequent abdominal ultrasound changes noted in dogs and cats with intestinal neoplasia are loss of normal bowel wall layering and increased bowel wall thickness. Ninety-nine percent of dogs with intestinal neoplasia have loss of bowel wall layering, while 88% of dogs without intestinal neoplasia retain normal bowel wall layering. In addition, dogs with focal abdominal ultrasound lesions are approximately 20 times more likely to have neoplasia, and dogs with bowel thickness greater than 1 cm are at four times greater risk of neoplasia.78 The advantages of abdominal ultrasound over plain and/or contrast radiography include (a) evaluation of other sites within the abdomen, (b) delineation of the presence or absence of carcinomatosis, (c) less time-consuming than contrast radiography, and (d) additional diagnostic utility gained through abdominal ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate or needle-core biopsy.13, 26, 79 Other findings commonly reported with abdominal ultrasound in patients with small intestinal neoplasia include mixed echogenicity asymmetric lesions, diffusely thickened bowel loops, anechoic to hypoechoic mass lesions, and in patients with carcinomatosis, the presence of masses in the \u201cdouble-sheet\u201d region of the peritoneum where the parietal and visceral portions meet, and the presence of free fluid.79\n",

Unfortunately, endoscopy has potentially significant limitations depending on the anatomic site of the tumor and the ability of the endoscope to reach the affected area. The gross appearance of neoplasia on endoscopy can range from a mass effect, to reduced dispensability of an otherwise phenotypically normal area, to a \u201ccobblestone\u201d and/or focal erythremic effect.76 An additional limitation to endoscopy is the size of the biopsy sample obtained, which can lead to significant interobserver variation in histopathologic interpretation.80 One study of feline lymphoma compared endoscopic samples with full-thickness biopsy samples collected at laparotomy. In that investigation, lymphoma was diagnosed in 10 cats from full-thickness samples, but in only three cats with endoscopic samples.81 For those cats with gastric lymphoma, endoscopic sampling diagnosed three of four cases, whereas in cats with intestinal lymphoma none of the six cats were diagnosed by endoscopic sampling. A similar study in dogs comparing endoscopic versus full-thickness sampling had comparable outcome.24\n",

I believe that for cats with a solitary intestinal lymphoma lesion, surgery should be seriously contemplated as it is one of the quickest and least-expensive mechanisms of tumor cytoreduction, especially in light of the relative chemotherapy resistance of feline lymphoma. FeLV status was highly prognostic for feline intestinal lymphoma with FeLV-positive cats treated with chemotherapy having a median survival time of 3 months versus 17 months if the cats were FeLV-negative (but this was only true in cats with early stage lymphoma and not significant in cats with later-stage neoplasia).19 Another study reported the primary prognostic factors to be FeLV status, substage, and response to therapy,34 but in other studies FeLV status was not prognostic.51, 84 Immunophenotype is not of prognostic benefit in dogs or cats with intestinal lymphoma, but this may be a result of poor statistical power from small numbers of cases reported to date.51 Labeling of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions is negatively correlated to clinical outcome in a variety of malignancies across species, but for feline alimentary lymphoma argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions were not associated with duration of remission, percentage of remission, or survival time.95 Median remission for cats with intestinal large-cell lymphoma is 5 to 7 months, but subsets that are poorly understood to date can have extended survival times.45, 84, 85\n",

The mucosa comprises the thin muscularis mucosa, the lamina propria, and the columnar epithelium; it is thrown into folds and is covered by finger-like villi to increase the digestive and absorptive surface area. D, Enterocytes, which are shed from the villus tip but are continually replaced through division of crypt cells, are the site of nutrient digestion and absorption. Goblet cells secrete protective mucus. Water-soluble nutrients pass into the rich capillary network of the lamina propria, and fat is passed as chylomicrons into the lacteals. Immunocytes in the lamina propria are involved in maintaining tolerance to luminal antigens. E, The luminal membrane of the enterocyte is thrown into processes called microvilli, which increase the luminal surface area. Tight junctions between enterocytes maintain epithelial integrity. Absorbed nutrients are passed from the enterocyte into the intercellular space for distribution to the body. F, Schematic of a microvillus showing digestive hydrolases anchored in the phospholipid cell membrane and protruding into the intestinal lumen. Carrier proteins in the membrane are believed to act as \u201cpores,\u201d shuttling nutrients across the membrane by means of conformational changes in their structure often induced by sodium influx at the expense of energy utilization through Na/K-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) on the basolateral membrane.",
