In particular, we have focused on first transitions of novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), (e.g., first approval in either the United States (US) or European Union (EU)) as a measure of innovation and success. This approach is stringent, as it necessarily excludes any subsequent development from the quantitative assessment. For example, if a product is first approved in the US, any subsequent approval in the EU or supplemental approval is not included in the product totals. By this measure, the number of antibody therapeutic products approved in 2019, as of November, (5 products) is the lowest since 2013, when only 2 products were approved. However, when looking at all US or EU first approvals, the data shows the biopharmaceutical industry has in fact made substantial advances in developing antibody therapeutics during 2010\u201319, nearly tripling the number of antibody therapeutics on the market (Figure 1).",

Overall, our projections suggest that the number of first approvals granted in the 2020s may exceed that of the 2010s. Based on the number of antibody therapeutics currently in regulatory review in either the US or EU, we anticipate that at least 13 products will be granted first approvals in 2020. The scale of approvals later in the decade depends entirely on the clinical pipeline of these products. We report here that the late-stage clinical pipeline is robust, and we anticipate that more antibody therapeutics will be in late-stage studies in 2020 than any year we previously documented (Figure 2). Remarkably, compared to 2010, the number of antibody therapeutics currently in late-stage studies has more than tripled (to 79). The early-stage commercial clinical pipeline is also robust, with at least 550 novel antibody therapeutics at Phase 1, 1/2 or Phase 2 as their most advanced stage of clinical studies (data not shown).",

The study initially included 3 test drugs: 1) mAb114, a single monoclonal antibody developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; 2) remdesivir (GS-5734), an antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc.; and 3) ZMapp, an antibody mixture developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc. ZMapp was included as the standard of care (i.e., control arm) of the study. The trial protocol was amended to include REGNEB3 after the World Health Organization recommended its addition as a fourth treatment arm. In August 2019, the PALM study was terminated early, after preliminary results indicated that patients receiving REGN-EB3 or mAb114 had a greater chance of survival compared to those in the other 2 study arms. At 28 days, death occurred in 33.5% of patients in the REGN-EB3 group compared with 51.3% in the ZMapp subgroup (P = .002), and 35.1% of patients in the MAb114 group compared with 49.7% in the ZMapp group (P = .007).68",

Teplizumab has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies, with more than 800 patients receiving the drug. The \u201cAt-Risk\u201d study, which was conducted by Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet (www.trialnet.org), included relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes who did not have diabetes, but were at high risk for development of clinical disease. A single 14-day course of teplizumab significantly delayed the onset and diagnosis of clinical T1D, as compared to placebo, with median times to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes of 48.4 months in the teplizumab group and 24.4 months in the placebo group.89 Provention Bio is currently evaluating teplizumab in the Phase 3 PROTECT study (NCT03875729) to determine whether teplizumab slows the loss of \u03b2 cells and preserves \u03b2 cell function in children and adolescents 8\u201317 years old who have been diagnosed with T1D in the previous 6 weeks. Estimated enrollment for the PROTECT study is 300 patients, and the estimated primary completion date is May 2022.",

FDA granted Lartruvo\u00ae accelerated approval on October 19, 2016, following the release of results from a Phase 1b/2 study in advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma that showed an 11.8-month improvement with olaratumab over placebo for advanced soft tissue sarcoma patients (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30\u20130.71, P = .0003), and a 16.1-month improvement in the leiomyosarcoma subgroup. FDA may grant accelerated approval for drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need based on whether the drug has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint, but subsequent confirmatory trials must verify clinical benefit. During 2017 to 2018, Lartruvo\u00ae was granted accelerated, conditional, and full approvals in more than 40 countries.",

On April 25, 2019, Eli Lilly and Company announced that the company is withdrawing Lartruvo\u00ae (olaratumab) from the market for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma because the ANNOUNCE clinical trial failed to confirm the drug\u2019s clinical benefit.106 Data from the study was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting held in June 2019. Overall, median OS was 20.4 months for patients who received the drug and 19.7 months for patients who participated in the control arm of the study (HR 1.05, 95% CI [0.84, 1.30]; p = .6945).

We do not, however, expect the number of antibody therapeutics in late-stage studies to substantially decrease because we are currently tracking at least 15 antibodies in early-stage studies that may transition to late-stage studies soon.
