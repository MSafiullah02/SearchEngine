            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped, single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA virus, belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus. PEDV was identified as the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) in 1978 (Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978). This disease is characterized by acute watery diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration, with high mortality that often reaches 100% in neonatal piglets. From 1984 to early 2010, PEDV circulated in the pig population in China, but there were no large\u2010scale outbreaks (Tamura, Stecher, Peterson, Filipski, & Kumar, 2013). At the end of 2010, a PEDV outbreak occurred in several pig\u2010producing provinces in southern China (Li et al., 2012). Since then, the disease has spread throughout other provinces of China and has led to enormous economic losses within the pork industry. Currently, PEDV infection is widespread in swine\u2010farming countries in Asia, Europe and North America (Lin, Saif, Marthaler, & Wang, 2016; Sun, Wang, Wei, Chen, & Feng, 2016; Wang et al., 2016). The emergence and re\u2010emergence of PEDV cause severe economic losses and pose significant public health concerns throughout the world.",

            "text": "In addition to PEDV, a large variety of porcine enteric pathogens has been found in diarrhoea samples from pigs, including porcine teschovirus (PTV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine sapelovirus (PSV), porcine enterovirus 9/10 (PEV), mammalian reovirus (MRV), porcine group A rotavirus (GARV), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine torovirus (PToV), torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV\u20102), porcine bocavirus (PBoV), porcine kobuvirus (PKV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV); however, data have indicated that PEDV is the major cause of viral diarrhoeal disease in swine in China (Decaro et al., 2005; Song et al., 2015; Wang, Zhou, et al., 2014; Zell et al., 2000; Zhang, Tang, Yue, Ren, & Song, 2014; Zhang et al., 2013). Viral diarrhoeal diseases caused by a variety of porcine enteric pathogens, and co\u2010infection with multiple enteric pathogens, are very prevalent in piglets with diarrhoea (Chen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014, 2013). In the case of PEDV, the variations in the virus and its co\u2010infections with multiple pathogens make it difficult to control the infection. However, limited data are available on co\u2010infections during PEDV infection in piglets with diarrhoea. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the co\u2010infection of PEDV with other pathogens.",

            "text": "The S protein of coronaviruses is responsible for induction of neutralizing antibodies, specific receptor binding and cell membrane fusion (Li, 2015; Sun et al., 2008). Deletion and/or insertion mutations of the S protein are potentially associated with the pathogenicity and tissue tropism of coronaviruses (Lin et al., 2016). In December 2013, an S\u2010INDEL strain, OH851, with reduced virulence, was reported in the USA (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014). Subsequently, S\u2010INDEL strains similar to OH851 have been frequently reported in other countries (Yamamoto, Soma, Nakanishi, Yamaguchi, & Niinuma, 2015). In a recent study, Wang et al. (2016) reported that three PEDV strains, non\u2010S\u2010INDEL, \u2018CV777\u2019 S\u2010INDEL and \u2018US\u2019 S\u2010INDEL co\u2010circulated in the swine population in China (Wang et al., 2016). The S1 region of the S protein is under greater immune pressure than the S2 region (Aydin, Al\u2010Khooly, & Lee, 2014; Jarvis et al., 2016). Widespread epidemiological investigations have demonstrated that the virulence\u2010determining S1 gene of PEDV is undergoing rapid mutation. Additionally, sialic acid binding activity is located in the N\u2010terminal domain (NTD) of PEDV S1 protein (Li, Kuppeveld, He, Rottier, & Bosch, 2016); the S1\u2010NTD of Chinese PEDV pandemic/variant strains exhibits strong sialic acid binding activity when compared with the classic PEDV strain (Deng et al., 2016). Thus, patterns of insertion and deletion mutations of the S1 protein (S1\u2010IDMPs) are an important target for better understanding of the emergence and re\u2010emergence of PEDV in Asia, Europe and North America. Although genotyping of PEDV pandemic strains has been widely undertaken in the pig population in China (Chen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2018), there is fairly limited information available on the S1\u2010IDMPs of PEDV pandemic strains.",

All the samples were used to investigate the co\u2010infection of PEDV with other enteric pathogens, and the S1 genes obtained were subjected to analysis of S1\u2010IDMPs, phylogenetic analysis and homology modelling of the protein.

For PEDV, the sialic acid binding activity is located in the NTD (aa 9\u2013433) of the S1 protein; the cellular receptor binding is located in the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD, aa 501\u2013629) of the S1 protein (Li et al., 2016). In addition, the S1\u2010IDMPs of 147 Chinese PEDV pandemic strains occurred in the NTD of the S1 protein; only the S1\u2010IDMP of the LN/DT/2016/510a strain, S58_S58insQGVN\u2013N135dup\u2013D158_I159del\u2013N553_Y560del, was located in the NTD and RBD of the S1 protein (Figure 3a). These data indicate that the S1\u2010IDMP S58_S58insQGVN\u2013N135dup\u2013D158_I159del, accounting for 97.28% (143/147), was the pandemic insertion and deletion mutation pattern in the 147 PEDV strains identified.",

Many studies of the mechanism of PEDV infection and effective vaccines have been published. However, co\u2010infections with multiple pathogens make it difficult to understand and control PEDV infections. In order to better understand the prevalence of the co\u2010infection of PEDV with other pathogens in China, a broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV and 13 other enteric viruses was carried out in this study. Co\u2010infections of PEDV with other enteric pathogens have been reported in previous studies. Zhang et al. (2014) reported that the co\u2010infection of PEDV and PBoV was more prevalent in diarrhoea samples than non\u2010diarrhoea samples (Zhang et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2018) reported that, among 217 PEDV\u2010positive samples, 27% (58/217) of samples had PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 73% (159/217) of samples exhibited two to nine pathogens (Chen et al., 2018). In our study, a high percentage of co\u2010infection among piglet diarrhoea samples was identified. Among the 543 diarrhoea samples, the mean number of pathogens per sample was 4.25, and 96.5% of samples were co\u2010infected with at least two different viruses, 67.4% of samples were co\u2010infected with three to five different pathogens and, notably, co\u2010infection with nine different pathogens was identified in three samples. According to this survey, single infection with PEDV occurred in only 0.92% of samples (5 out of 543), while most of the samples involved co\u2010infections.",

These data suggest that PKV has a potential role in PEDV\u2010induced diarrhoea symptoms. TTSuV\u20102 is frequently detected in pigs affected with porcine post\u2010weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) (Wang et al., 2009), and PEV infections remain asymptomatic or show mild pathogenicity in pigs (Zell et al., 2000). Both TTSuV\u20102 and PEV exhibited a high prevalence in diarrhoeic piglets in this study, and when compared with PEDV\u2010negative samples, a highly significant association of PEV (p = .033) and TTSuV\u20102 (p = .032) infection with PEDV\u2010positive samples was observed.
