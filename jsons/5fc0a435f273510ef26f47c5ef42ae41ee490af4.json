The earliest known bats likely arose during the Eocene era (49-53 million years ago); however, their actual evolutionary history is partially obscured by the paucity of intact fossil records. There have been a number of speculative theories with respect to whether bats evolved the ability to fly first or whether they first developed the ability to listen to the reflected echoes from sounds that they emitted in order to map out their environment ).

            "text": "echolocation). Recent information gleaned from a rare 52 million year old bat fossil suggests that flight evolved before echolocation(2). Regardless of which came first, bats have a remarkable capacity for flight, and can achieve speeds of up to160 kilometers per hour (99 mph), as well as remain in flight continuously for hours at a time. Germane to this discussion, the evolutionary pressures imposed by flight in bats have selected for a novel suite of antiviral immune responses that control viral propagation, while also limiting self-damaging inflammatory responses. This evolutionary step may have allowed bats to emerge as zoonotic hosts for viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.Because bats have high metabolic rates and high body temperatures (often > 41\u00baC), they are prone to developing oxidative stress during flight, which can lead to DNA damage, and initiate brisk inflammatory responses if the damaged DNA leaks into the cytosolic compartment.Selective evolutionary pressures related to flying appear to have positively selected for antioxidant and DNA repair pathways that allow bats to effectively engage tissue repair mechanisms without excessive inflammatory responses. As one example, bats cells appear to have a diminished ability to detect endogenous damaged DNA because of mutations in STING (stimulator of interferon genes), which is an endoplasmic reticulum adaptor protein that regulates the expression of type 1 IFN host response genes (3). Although, this adaptation would not be important in terms of directly preventing pathological immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 (a single stranded RNA), it is likely important in terms of preventing pathological immune responses to DNA damage after prolonged flight. The STING pathway might also represent a novel therapeutic target in COVID-19 patients, wherein SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death might lead to release of damaged DNA fragments in alveolar cells, resulting in a brisk inflammatory response and collateral tissue damage. Perhaps not surprisingly, biotech companies are targeting small molecule inhibitors of the STING pathway to dampen inflammatory signaling in autoimmune diseases (4). Bats also appear to have developed ways to directly limit viral replication, by enhancing autophagic repair mechanisms (5). Bats have also developed unique mechanisms that allow them to mount and maintain a strong type I IFN responses, which is the critical first line of anti-viral defense in mammalian cells (3). The initiation of anti-viral immune responses begins with the engagement of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. Single stranded RNA coronaviruses that enter the endosomal compartment of cells initiate anti-viral responses by binding to toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, an endosomal pattern recognition receptor. In the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell, retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins (MAVs) are capable of detecting double strand viral RNA moieties. Following recognition and engagement with viral genomic material, the aforementioned pattern recognition receptors induce the expression of hundreds of type 1 IFN genes that upregulate cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic anti-viral responses. Intriguingly, bats constitutively express IFN\u03b1 genes in the absence of stimulation by genomic viral RNA or DNA. In other mammalian species chronic inflammation is associated with a poor prognosis; however, bats have evolved novel mechanisms that limit inflammation-mediated cell damage through upregulation of inhibitory proteins such as c-Rel, that prevents the activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B, a central mediator of cellular inflammatory responses (3). The immune cell of bats have also evolved mechanisms to decrease NLRP3 (nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation (3). Relevant to this discussion there are three ongoing clinical trials that are evaluating colchicine (which inhibits inflammasome activation) in COVID-19 patients. The largest of these trials is the randomized open-label controlled trial to study the benefit of colchicine in patients with COVID-19 (COL-COVID [NCT0435032]",
