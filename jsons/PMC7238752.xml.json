An online assessment tool from the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC; CA, USA) is available to help determine the severity of infection [23]; however, beyond palliative care, not much can be done for patients in critical condition and requiring ventilation. Use of a high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation may not be warranted until the patient has viral clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [24,25] because noninvasive ventilation is unlikely to improve patient outcomes [25], and high oxygen levels may reduce immunity and exacerbate infection [26]. However, prone placement of the patient, combined with high-flow nasal cannulation has been demonstrated to reduce mortality in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [27]. Vitamin C infusion is unlikely to be useful [28], although the authors of this study found a number of positive effects of high dose, intravenous vitamin C infusion in septic patients [29], a common complication of Covid-19 [30]. Corticoid steroid use in Covid-19 patients reduces immunity and is therefore not recommended [31], unless there is another indication requiring its use. Similarly, bone marrow stem cell transplants are being widely tested for Covid-19 throughout the world but run the risk of reducing immunity through a phenotypic change of T cells to a more aged type [32,33]. While performing these procedures requires more study, they may increase the risk of infection for physicians, nurses, other healthcare workers and other noninfected patients without benefit to the Covid-19 patient.",

Unfortunately, physicians can do little for most of their Covid-19 patients beyond palliative care or antibiotics for secondary pneumonia infection, where a separate study demonstrated that half of the nonsurvivors experienced a secondary infection, with ventilator-associated pneumonia occurring in 31% (10/32) of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [35]. Nearly all Covid-19 patients have received antibiotics; however, scientists in the UK are warning that antibiotic resistance may become a problem during this pandemic [36]. This may suggest that vaccination for bacterial pneumonia may be beneficial for preventing secondary infections in Covid-19 patients.",

However, considering the importance of T cells in clearing viral infections, exercise may stimulate the production of naive T cells, as previous studies determined that contracting skeletal muscle produces IL-7 [47], which may increase thymic mass and function [48]. In addition, sunlight in moderate amounts enhances your immune system, initially in the skin and then systemically, through the production of vitamin D, which along with other mechanisms enhances T-cell function [49,50].",

For example, broccoli sprouts have also been demonstrated to increase the ability of T cells to produce a virus-killing chemical called granzyme B, presumably helping to fight the induced respiratory infection in test subjects who had an induced immune reaction using a live-attenuated influenza vaccination [60]. In another study, blueberry consumption for 6 weeks increased natural killer cell counts, and acute ingestion reduced oxidative stress and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines [61]. Thus, blueberries may help to fight viral infection and reduce the resulting inflammation. In a series of studies, Colin Campbell at Cornell University (NY, USA) determined that a plant-based diet suppressed liver cancers caused by hepatitis B virus infection, suggesting that in addition to inhibiting liver cancer started by the hepatitis B virus, the same nutrition also likely inactivated the virus itself, otherwise, the virus would likely continue to initiate new cancer development [62].",

Studies have shown that a diet containing reduced saturated fat and cholesterol led to manipulation of lipid metabolism in monkeys, which in turn provided significant benefits by slowing down simian immunodeficiency virus disease progression [69]. Furthermore, reducing fat intake will decrease serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels [70] and may, therefore, decrease one\u2019s risk factor for Covid-19 by decreasing the number of binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 in our respiratory and pulmonary tissues. Meats, eggs, coconut and palm oil are high in saturated fats and therefore should be avoided. In addition, consuming large volumes of fish, or fish oil, will also lower immunity [71], as fish oil supplements work to reduce inflammation because they reduce immune function.

While there is no evidence, research is currently underway to determine whether the upregulation of ACE2 receptors in those cardiovascular patients on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers exacerbates or reduces the Covid-19 infection [77,78]. ACE2 is expressed in numerous immune cell types [79], including the precursor cell to many immune cells, bone marrow stem cells [80]. ACE inhibitors regulate the adaptive and innate immune systems and may decrease immunity to viral infection, although the results are mixed [79]. In view of insufficient research, numerous groups at leading academic medical centers have advised cardiac patients in need of these medications to be treated [81,82]. According to oncologist Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, \u201cdifferent cancers produce immune suppression to different extents\u201d, and according to an article in The Lancet, \u201cindividuals who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy for lung cancer, and patients with cancers of the blood or bone marrow may be at particular risk for infection\u201d [83]. Therefore, patients on chemotherapy for cancer should talk to their oncologist about whether the chemotherapy drug being prescribed is beneficial. In the USA, 18 of 36 US FDA-approved cancer drugs using surrogate end points were shown to have no effect on the cancer. These drugs would, therefore, theoretically only do harm, while potentially increasing the probability of a Covid-19 infection [84].",

Nor will humans adapt rapidly enough to remain healthy in an ever changing and expanding exposome, including the newly made more than 2000 chemicals created every year [86]. To better live with the rapidly changing environment being created, new therapeutic strategies must emerge, for example, using systems therapeutics for physiological renormalization [87,88] to bring our bodies into a state of allostasis [89], where the immune system components are in balance to fight infection, and inflammation can be properly resolved. An important example of renormalizing the immune system is in cancer therapeutics where \u2018checkpoint inhibitors\u2019 renormalize T cells to attack the tumor, a technology for which the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James Allison [90]. When fiber is ingested by the patient being dosed with checkpoint inhibitors, the therapeutic effect is enhanced by the fiber, better enabling T-cell function [52] \u2013 demonstration of a system therapeutic approach to physiological renormalization. Most important to man\u2019s future, current public health measures and organizations must be maintained, such as support for the WHO and its programs throughout the world. Better public health measures must also be enacted, such as those proposed steps needed for cooperative scientific programs between the USA and China to better protect the global community from zoonotic diseases, such as Covid-19 and future emerging diseases [91]. Unfortunately, \u2018exogenous shocks can increase the significance of nationalism\u2019 [92]. Thus, the global Covid-19 pandemic, an exogenous shock, may be bringing forth the articulation of nationalism among some world leaders [93], just at a time when cooperation throughout the world is needed. Not only will support of the WHO lead to better public health measures and scientific progress, but proposed scientific programs across countries [91], such as that recently presented by The Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network [94], will increase the rate of scientific progress in understanding these diseases. This group of scientists from around the world found significantly enhanced ACE2 expression as we age. Data such as these may help to explain why children have a reduced probability of Covid-19 infection [95], and may help to stratify the population into those at high risk for infection and therefore develop appropriate public health measures to protect such groups.",

            "text": "Furthermore, new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) have proven valuable for early warning once an outbreak has occurred. As an example, The Global Public Health Intelligence Network [96], an AI-based surveillance system initiated and run by Health Canada and the WHO, currently analyzes more than 20,000 online news reports in nine languages daily. This AI system was credited with the first alerts for SARS and MERS [96]. If these big data from AI are supported by epidemiological outbreak investigations on the ground, then false alarms can be avoided, and proper public health strategies developed. Strategies should include proper diet for those at risk to better prevent and mitigate infectious diseases. Therefore, AI surveillance [96] and outbreak investigations, such as that used to predict outbreaks of the dengue viral infection [97], along with proper public health measures need to be scaled up and integrated into a comprehensive global early warning system and follow-on public health measures. These follow-on public health measures, in order to be more effective, should include careful consideration of the exposome and nutritional needs to better prevent and mitigate infectious diseases. In the near future, medicine needs to perform more autopsies on Covid-19 patients, as autopsy is a key means to learn about diseases [98], and recent autopsies of Covid-19 patients have found, for example, complement-associated microvascular injury and thrombosis with resultant stroke [99].",
