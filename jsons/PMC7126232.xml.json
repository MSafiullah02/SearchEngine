The limitations of echocardiography include operator dependence, limited acoustic shadows, a small field of view, and poor evaluation of pulmonary veins. The limitations of cardiac catheterization include the overlapping of great vessels, difficulty in demonstrating systemic and pulmonary vessels at the same time, catheter-related complications, and high doses of iodinated contrast material and ionizing radiation. Computed tomography (CT) can overcome these limitations,1 and previous studies widely reported its use in the evaluation of pediatric congenital heart disease.2, 3, 4, 5\n",

DeVries et al11 evaluated CT utilization patterns in children with recurrent headache and reported overuse of head CT despite existing guidelines.

Owing to the high spatial resolution, CT evaluates the course of the coronary artery more effectively than diagnostic cardiac catheterization.14 CT can also produce postprocessing images, such as three-dimensional volume-rendering images,15 which clearly demonstrate the anatomical relationships in great vessel disorder. If patients refuse cardiac catheterization, CT may provide vital information, in three-dimensional volume-rendering images, and reveal the intracardiac pathology.15 In patients with Marfan syndrome, a subtype of great vessel disorder, CT can reveal dilatation of the sinus of Valsalva and effacement of the sinotubular junction.16 CT can also provide volumetric measurements of the right ventricle prior to and after atrial septal defect closure. Catheterization cannot effectively perform this task.17 Cardiac catheterization reportedly induces transient or complete heart block in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.18 In patients suspected to have congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, noninvasive CT is, therefore, useful for diagnosis without incurring such a life-threatening event.19\n",

The benefits of CT include good spatial resolution and powerful postprocessing techniques. Diagnostic cardiac catheterization, however, can provide dynamic images and pressure gradient measurements.20 Clinicians may select either catheterization or CT, or both examinations, depending on the clinical conditions. CT can provide excellent visualizations of mitral and aortic valves, including the number of valve leaflets, opening and closing of leaflets, leaflet thickness, and leaflet calcifications.21 However, CT is unable to fully evaluate valvular stenosis or regurgitation, which diagnostic cardiac catheterization can easily detect.22 Determinations of aortic valve area by CT correlate well with catheterization findings.23 In myocardial disorder, a diagnosis of myocarditis or rejection of heart transplantation usually requires referring to histological specimen(s). In such cases, catheterization is superior to CT.24 For the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, the ratio of the right ventricular to the left ventricular systolic area during inspiration and expiration is a reliable catheterization criterion.25 CT can also diagnose constrictive pericarditis via demonstration of calcified pericardium.26 Utilization of catheterization or CT for diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is, therefore, mainly based on clinicians' decisions and the availability of diagnostic modalities.",

Common indications for pediatric CMR without anesthesia include valve regurgitation, repaired tetralogy of Fallot, and postoperative evaluation of univentricular heart. Meanwhile, recommendations for diagnostic catheterization include assessment of filling pressure, and pulmonary resistance.47 Despite the recent advances in noninvasive imaging study, diagnostic catheterization remains the \u201cfinal authority\u201d to provide definite anatomical and hemodynamic information for very complex lesions.47\n",

One previous study (2009) claimed that approximately 29,000 future cancers could be related to 1 year of CT scan in the United States.48 However, a recent study49 published in 2014 claimed that zero radiation-induced malignancy were detected after routine CT scans. They evaluated 104 children who underwent cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement prior to the age of 6 years and with at least 10 years of follow-up data. These children had a total of 1584 CT scans over a follow-up period of 1622 person-years. There were no subsequent benign or malignant tumors, or leukemia detected in their enrolled children. This single-institution study did not adequately define the actual risk. Further collaborative efforts should be made to define the actual risk to patients.",

This study describes the utilization patterns of cardiac CT, and diagnostic and interventional cardiac catheterization in only one institution and may not reflect the patterns of utilization in other hospitals or other countries. The authors did not evaluate MRI for comparison owing to a lack of required equipment for children in the institute. The available information did not allow us to investigate the appropriateness of the imaging modalities performed. The selection of diagnostic modalities might reflect the referring cardiologist's judgment of necessity. Moreover, we could not directly infer that the increase in CT scans is the cause of the decrease in diagnostic catheterization.

Results suggest that CT might replace diagnostic catheterization in selected congenital heart disease conditions: great vessel disorder, coronary artery disorder, atrioventricular connection disorder, septal disorder, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventriculoarterial connection disorder. In patients with other disorders, clinicians may select either catheterization or CT, or both examinations, depending on the clinical conditions. Cardiac CT uses lower radiation doses than cardiac catheterization. The use of CT releases time, manpower, and facilities in the catheterization laboratory with which to meet the increasing demands of cardiac intervention.",
