Ra.ther than using only a single observation, we perform recognition by exploiting the terngord correla.tion and constraints arnong multiple pcople observations acquired at, different timc instances. Consequently, our method can effectively enhance the liniited discriminating power of lowlevel features, such as color histogranis and face featxres acquired using a ca,mcra, from a distance.

In Fig. 9 , wlieri the confidence index is lower than 0.8, the ML approach is likely to make a wrong decision at the corresponding time (as indicated by the circlos).
