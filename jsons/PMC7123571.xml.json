It is largely an extrovert\u2019s sport played by social animals with an abundance of self-confidence. Boulevardiering regularly breaks out among the Neapolitan natives near the Castel Nuovo off Via Nuovo Marina Boulevard or most anywhere the stylishly dressed Italians happen to go in the cool evening after siesta and before dinner at 9 pm. Italians love to be spontaneous, but with style. They fondly call these spontaneous exhibitionists, \u201cBoulevard Animali\u201d\u2014parading animals.",

I summarize the results shown in Fig. 2.7 through 2.9:Flashmob formation is a Levy Flight in size and elapsed time between switches in majority opinion when the social network is sparse and conviction is low. Low conviction accelerates the rate of self-organization. Large flashmobs quickly form when actors lacking conviction listen to a small number of strong influencers. On the contrary, large flashmobs are inhibited from forming when conviction is high or actors listen to more than a dozen neighbors. Too many influences attenuate flashmob intensity and retard the rate of self-organization.A pinned RED actor dominates BLUE actors if its number of neighbors exceeds the number of neighbors of BLUE, and vice versa. If you want to steer mobs in one direction, start with the most connected actor. Revolutions are started and successfully completed by highly connected and strong actors simply because number of links equals influence. A small advantage in terms of connectivity accelerates the rate of self-organization.Structured networks with a large pinned hub are dominated by the initial position of the hub. This structure introduces additional extremes\u2014the tail of the hub distribution is longer, and the tail of the subordinate actor distribution is shorter. The larger the hub, the easier it is to control the network and the larger is the flashmob. A hub amplifies influence\u2014a scale-free network amplifies influence of the hub even more.4 Self-organization\u2014as measured by spectral radius\u2014is enhanced by hub size.Structured networks with large hubs change majorities more often when the pinned initial RED and BLUE actors have more links than when they have fewer links. Hub size introduces volatility. Conversely, fewer links means longer elapsed times between majority switching. Pinning highly connected actors introduces more volatility, and pinning slightly connected actors introduces stronger majorities. When conviction is low, flashmobs can be whiplashed back and forth by highly connected actors. Self-organization goes hand-in-hand with hub size, setting up competition between RED and BLUE when both networks contain large hubs.\n",
