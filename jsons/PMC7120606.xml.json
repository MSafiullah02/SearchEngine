The actual term \u201cPost-Modernism\u201d was coined in part as a reaction against experimental scientists who pursued with seeming ever-growing success an objective description of reality during the Modern Era. Stereotypical Post-Modernists have expressed a healthy scepticism towards \u201cscientific\u201d explanations of phenomena that claim to be valid for all groups, societies, cultures, traditions, and races. They have argued that the truths encountered by a given individual are relative, and that the way a person perceives the world is inherently subjective. Further, they have maintained that language, power relations, and motivations play a crucial role in the shaping not only ideas and beliefs but also the ways in which we investigate and describe them.",

            "text": "But this time-frame is not universally accepted. Rather, the suggested advent of the Post-Modern Era seems to vary with social discipline. Already, in the 1870s, artists were discussing Post-Modernism as a move beyond Impressionist painting. Theologians began talking about Post-Modernism during World War I, but the term did not become common among architects until the 1950s. From the viewpoint of Health and Physical Fitness in North America, the present era was probably initiated by formation of the President\u2019s Council on Physical Fitness in the U.S. (1956 CE) and in Canada by a speech that the Duke of Edinburgh made to the Canadian Medical Association (in 1959 CE). For Canadians, the Duke\u2019s speech was quickly followed by passage of the Federal Bill C-131, and formation of the Federal Directorate of Fitness & Amateur Sport in 1961 CE. On the world stage, also, the early 1960s was an important turning point for Exercise Scientists, as the sophisticated apparatus previously available only to a few privileged Medically-staffed clinical laboratories became available to Kinesiologists and Physical Educators. The Post-Modern Era that we shall discuss in this chapter thus extends from the early 1960s through to the present day. Paradoxically for some Post-modernists, it is marked by ever more precise objective measurements, and the basing of health-care decisions upon evidence derived from the grouped responses of substantial numbers of people rather than individual perspectives.",

            "text": "When evaluating metabolic responses to exercise, the traditional approach of the Respiratory Physiologist was to collect several samples of expired gas in large rubberized canvas or neoprene bags at 30\u201360 s intervals. This required a very precisely timed turning of valves; a one-breath difference in the duration of gas collection could immediately cause an error of 2\u20133 % in estimates of an individual\u2019s oxygen consumption. Then, the contents of the bags had to be sampled, using an evacuated glass tube or a large syringe. Finally, the gas composition was determined by a tedious process of chemical analysis, and the volume of gas that had been expired was measured by emptying the Douglas bag through a dry gas meter. Up to 30 min was required in order to complete a single measurement of oxygen consumption, and this greatly limited the number of observations that could be made during any one investigation. Further, if the bag was stored for any considerable time, gas concentrations were changed by selective diffusion of carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen through the fabric of the bags (Shephard 1955a).",

His device measured pressure differentials across a 35 mm pipe that was filled with small parallel tubes. Others, such as myself, measured the pressure drop across a broad metal gauze that was inserted into the expired gas flow line. There were two main problems with either type of pneumotachograph: calibration curves became non-linear at the high flow rates encountered in maximal exercise, due to turbulence, and pressure differentials could be further distorted by an accumulation of water droplets in the tubes or on the gauze.",

The turbine approach has been adopted in most current metabolic carts. Turbine flow-meter data can also be compromised because of inertia of the rotors at low flow rates, and slippage of gas at high respiratory minute volumes.",

This device exploited the fact that the rate of heat loss (and thus electrical resistance) in one arm of a Wheatstone bridge network could be modulated by a change in the carbon dioxide content of gas surrounding the resistor (Daynes and Shakespear 1920). Other early methods of electronic gas analysis included interferometry and mass spectrometry. During the 1950s, the non-dispersive infra-red analyzer was developed by the High Altitude Physiologist Ulrich Cameron Luft (1910\u20131991 CE). This device quickly became the option of choice for the determination of respiratory carbon dioxide concentrations (Dubois et al. 1952; Fowler 1949), and the paramagnetic analyzer of Linus Pauling (1901\u20131994 CE) became the preferred method of assessing oxygen concentrations. However, both of these devices had rather slow response times, making them unsuitable for breath-by-breath analyses of respiratory gas, and the infra-red monitor had the further disadvantage that a minimum gas sample of at least 100 mL per was needed for each measurement.",

Carbon dioxide concentrations were determined by a system where an electrode was surrounded by a thin film of a bicarbonate solution contained within a plastic sheath; diffusion of carbon dioxide through the sheath modified the pH of the bicarbonate and thus the electrical output of the glass electrode (Severinghaus and Bradley 1958). A polarographic electrode (originally conceived for the analysis of blood oxygen levels) was used to determine gaseous oxygen concentrations (Clark et al. 1953); electron flow reduced oxygen to hydroxyl ions at the cathode, creating an electrical output proportional to oxygen pressures (Fig. 9.1). Other oxygen sensors that are now used occasionally in metabolic studies include a high temperature Zirconia fuel cell (Roe et al. 1987), and a mass spectrometer (Hunter et al. 1949).\n\n",

The Oxylog was devised by Humphrey, who had spent much of his two years of compulsory Military Service struggling to keep a collection of integrated motor pneumotachographs (IMPS) functional (Humphrey and Wolff 1977). In the new device, the troublesome sliding potentiometer (which had been used to measure ventilation, and frequently jammed in use) was replaced by a Wright turbine flow-meter. Nevertheless, during moderate physical activity the Oxylog still yielded values some 5 % lower than those obtained by a traditional Douglas bag and mouthpiece (mainly because of leakage around the facemask) (Louhevaara et al. 1985). The Oxycon (Rietjens et al. 2001) was developed by the Meijnhart Company. It also used a turbine flow-meter, with gas sampling every 10 ms; estimates of oxygen consumption were claimed to match Douglas bag readings to within 2\u20133 %. Several authors compared the output of the Cosmed K2 against Douglas bag data; some found good agreement (Lucia et al. 1993), but others noted substantial divergences (Lothian et al. 1993).",

In terms of healthy and well-motivated young adults, this question was largely answered by the observations of the International Biological Programme Working Party on the standardization of exercise tests; in 1966 CE, they demonstrated that plateau values were obtained consistently during repeated testing of 24 young men, irrespective of whether a continuous (ramp) or discontinuous test protocol was used (Shephard et al. 1968a). Maximal testing yielded plateaus less consistently in prepubescent children and the elderly. Nevertheless, the IBP Working Party were able to obtain a clear plateau in 35 of a representative sample of 47 young urban children (Shephard et al. 1969). Likewise, in seniors aged 65\u201384 years, a plateau was reached in 37 of 55 subjects at their first attempt at maximal exercise, and about a half of the remaining subjects reached a plateau when they were retested (Sidney and Shephard 1977). Moreover, both in the children and the seniors, failure to reach a plateau was associated with evidence of poor motivation such as a low peak heart rate, a low respiratory gas exchange ratio and low peak lactate readings (Sidney and Shephard 1977; Shephard 1994).",

Electronic analysers based on the enzyme/electrode principle were developed by the Yellow Springs Instruments, Boehringer-Mannheim and Radiometer companies during the 1980s, and these devices were in turn quickly supplanted by small portable lactate analyzers that could be used in the field (Buckley et al. 2003). The portable analyzers also employed an enzymatic electrode system, and their normally acceptable accuracy could be disturbed if they were used at cold temperatures (Franklin 2000). However, these instruments greatly facilitated not only assessment of the quality of maximal aerobic effort, but also the determination of other closely related metabolic parameters such as the anaerobic threshold (Wasserman 1984; Wasserman and McIlroy 1964), the work rate at which blood lactate begins to accumulate (Sj\u00f6din and Jacobs 1981) and the maximal lactate steady state (Heck et al. 1985).",

I was intrigued to seek out the \u201cbottle-neck\u201d during my first few years in Toronto, and measured maximal values for individual links in the oxygen transport chain during near-maximal effort; the variables examined included the maximal voluntary ventilation (Shephard 1967b), the oxygen cost of breathing (Shephard 1966b), the maximal pulmonary diffusing capacity (Anderson and Shephard 1968), and the maximal cardiac output (Simmons and Shephard 1971). Both the late John Sutton (Sutton 1992) and Peter Wagner (Wagner 1996) have had a similar idea of looking at oxygen consumption as a closely linked chain reaction. By applying the analogue of an electrical conductance (Shephard 2010a), and looking at the distribution of gas pressure gradients, I concluded that for oxygen the most important factor limiting oxygen transport in the average healthy individual was blood stream conductance (the product of peak muscle blood flow and the oxygen carrying capacity of unit volume of blood) (Shephard 1969, 1970).\n\n",

            "text": "However, a variety of other factors can limit oxygen transport, both in athletes with a very large maximal oxygen intake, and in individuals with chronic disease (Table 9.1), If the exercise does not involve most of the major muscles in the body, the local accumulation of lactate and the rise of blood pressure may limit muscular effort before the capacity of the central circulation has been fully taxed (Table 9.2). Fatigue of the respiratory muscles is a minor factor in most healthy individuals (Macklem 1979), but in some people, maximal performance may be limited by the sensation of dyspnoea, which depends in part on the strength of the inspiratory muscles (Killian and Campbell 1974). In athletes who develop very high respiratory flow rates, during maximal exercise, collapse of the airway and a limitation of expiratory gas flow can also become a significant factor (Grimby et al. 1971), particularly if there is a tendency to exercise-induced bronchospasm; this can also be an issue for individuals with chronic respiratory disease. The maximal circulatory transport of oxygen depends on pulmonary venous blood being almost fully saturated with oxygen during its passage through the lungs; however, in some athletes, a poor matching of ventilation and perfusion may cause a significant desaturation of pulmonary venous blood during maximal effort (Gledhill et al. 1977); again, this is a problem that can also arise in chronic respiratory disease. In the central circulation, the maximization of stroke volume can be limited by poor venous tone and thus a limitation of venous return, as in vaso-regulatory asthenia (Holmgren 1967); this problem is most likely when a person is exercising in the vertical position, and is avoided when swimming. Maximal circulatory transport also depends on the peak heart rate; the maximal heart rate decreases with age, and it may also be limited by the administration of beta-blocking drugs. Athletes may attempt to boost their haemoglobin concentration and thus oxygen carriage per unit of cardiac output by high altitude residence (Stray-Gunderson et al. 2001); some also use tactics not sanctioned by athletic anti-doping organizations (such as autologous blood transfusion or the administration of erythropoietin to stimulate red cell formation). Conversely, anemia can compromise the volume of oxygen transported per unit of cardiac output. When exercising in an urban environment, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood may be reduced by exposure to carbon monoxide (Wright and Shephard 1978). Again, the efficiency of circulatory transport depends upon the almost complete removal of oxygen from the capillaries within the active muscles. The capillary density per muscle fibre can be enhanced by training, thus tending to facilitate tissue diffusion and peripheral oxygen extraction; however, because of associated hypertrophy of the muscle fibres, the average diffusion distance from the capillary to the muscle membrane is not necessarily diminished by aerobic training (Hermansen and Wachtlova 1971). Finally, the ability of muscle to consume the oxygen that is delivered to it depends on local energy reserves, delivery of substrates and an adequate level of aerobic enzyme activity within the muscle mitochondria.\n\n",

Breath-by-breath analysis of oxygen consumption has certainly become possible. This allows the investigator to make a more precise definition of an individual\u2019s ventilatory threshold (the oxygen consumption associated with a disproportionate increase in ventilation) (Davis et al. 1980). It has also become much easier to visualize attainment of an oxygen consumption plateau (the classic criterion of all-out aerobic effort, where oxygen consumption increases by less than 2 mL/[kg.min] in response to a further increase in the rate of working, Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-11671-6_8). However, it is worth underlining that both the standardization of fitness test methodology that was conducted by the International Working Party (Shephard et al. 1968a, b, 1969), and research on the oxygen conductance theorem (which identified the circulatory system as the primary bottleneck to oxygen transport during vigorous exercise, Shephard 1970) were completed using the classical Douglas bag approach.",

Thus, the Working Party demonstrated that in ordinary people, a treadmill test yielded a maximal oxygen transport that was 7 % larger than that for cycle ergometry, and 4 % larger than that for maximal stepping (Shephard et al. 1968a). I was able to explore this issue further in 1984\u20131985, when working with Henri Vandewalle and Hugues Monod at the Piti\u00e9 Salpetri\u00e8re Hospital in Paris. We compared the peak oxygen consumption developed when exercising with one or two legs, the arms and the forearms. We were able to show a gradation of peak oxygen intakes that correlated with anthropometric estimates of the muscle volume that had been activated (Shephard et al. 1988b), although there was also a substantial intercept due to the oxygen cost of maintaining body posture during the less standard forms of exercise (Table 9.2).",

Moreover, most Exercise Scientists accept the view of Consensus Committees that one of the most important factors limiting an individual\u2019s endurance performance is the ability of the heart and circulation to transport oxygen from the lungs to the working tissues (Shephard 2009a). Nevertheless, Tim Noakes (1949-), the controversial Professor of Physiology at the University of Cape Town, has recently challenged the usefulness of measuring maximal oxygen intake in athletes (Noakes 2008). Noakes has drawn upon an idea advanced by C.V. Ulmer (Ulmer 1996), arguing that endurance performance is limited by an ill-defined \u201cCentral Governor,\u201d rather than by the oxygen-carrying capacity of the central circulation. In Noakes\u2019 view, this governor operates as a feed-forward control system that protects an athlete from exercising to a level that could cause tissue damage through either hypoxia or hyperthermia (Noakes and Marino 2009; Noakes et al. 2001). Most Exercise Scientists would agree that athletes do limit their energy expenditure in prolonged endurance events, but they regard this as a pacing tactic that has been learned in collaboration with their coaches rather than as the operation of some shadowy Central Governor; the learned objectives of the competitor are to avoid depleting glycogen reserves too early in a prolonged event, and to limit a punishing build-up of tissue lactate until the final sprint.",

However, a clearer understanding of Bayes theorem and the principles of biological screening quickly dashed such hopes. Bayes theorem was described many years ago by Thomas Bayes (1702\u20131761 CE), a Presbyterian minister living in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. During the 1970s, clinical investigators began to apply this mathematical concept to a critical evaluation of various current and proposed biological screening procedures (Andermann et al. 2008; Wilson and Jungner 1968). They soon appreciated that in a healthy population with a low prevalence of cardiac disease, the sensitivity and specificity of most exercise stress tests was such that an unacceptable proportion of patients would inevitably develop false positive test responses. Such apparently abnormal findings would then require further evaluation, and had the potential to cause long-lasting cardiac neuroses in the individuals who were misdiagnosed (Shephard 1981).",

In 1982 CE, the Italian Parliament enacted legislation making such resting ECG evaluations mandatory, and in consequence a substantial proportion of quite healthy Italian athletes with what were wrongly judged as \u201cECG abnormalities\u201d were advised against taking any further vigorous exercise. Further, many competitors faced the expense and anxiety of undergoing secondary clearance by such techniques such as echocardiography in order to clarify that their ECG test results were false rather than true positive test results.",

However, critics have pointed out that the incidence of such episodes was still no lower in Italy than in North America (where preliminary ECG screening of athletes was not mandatory). Many of the early diagnoses of supposedly abnormal ECGs in Italian competitors were based upon increased voltages of the QRS complex (an almost inevitable consequence of a larger heart and a thinner overlying layer of subcutaneous fat). ECG criteria of normality specific to the athlete were not introduced until 2010 CE (Corrado et al. 2010), and unfortunately, this late recognition of the need for altered, athletic-specific criteria of ECG normality has cast additional doubt upon earlier claims for the efficacy of an ECG screening process that Italian cardiologists now admit used inappropriate norms. Vigorous debate continues, but North American cardiologists still reject the idea of universal ECG screening of athletes, largely because it inevitably produces so many worrying and costly false positive test results (Maron et al. 2007; Shephard 2011a, c).",

            "text": "Echocardiograohy is now widely used to assess the thickness and movements of the ventricular walls (Fig. 9.3). The standard clinical M-mode echocardiogram was popularized by Harvey Feigenbaum during the 1960s. He showed that echocardiographic estimates of heart volume compared closely with the values that could be obtained by the more invasive technique of angiography (Feigenbaum 1996). Dekker and colleagues (Dekker et al. 1974) introduced the refinement of a 3-dimensional echocardiogram. Sports Physicians quickly began to exploit echocardiography, both to evaluate the health of the heart in athletes where supposed abnormalities had been detected during mandatory ECG screening, and also to search for evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which some authors claimed was the commonest cause of sudden exercise-induced death in young athletes (Maron et al. 2009). However, the setting of appropriate goal-posts for diagnosing a pathological ventricular hypertrophy (such as the ratio of inter-septal to posterior wall thickness or end-systolic diameter) has remained a thorny problem. Many cardiologists have expressed concern if the ratio of interventricular septum to posterior ventricular wall thickness exceeds 1.3, although septum to wall thickness ratios can rise as high as 2.0 in some endurance athletes, apparently without adverse consequences (Huston et al. 1985). Upper limits for the dimensions of interest have thus undergone frequent adjustment (Shephard 1996) and as with other screening tests, it has been difficult to establish clear norms that are effective in distinguishing the physiological hypertrophy seen in all endurance athletes from the pathological changes associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Pelliccia et al. 2012a, b). A recent ultra-sound study of 114 Olympic athletes, spanning their participation in two to five Olympic Games, emphasized that despite large left ventricles, top endurance competitors normally showed no cardiovascular symptoms, and little change of left ventricular morphology or function as their sport participation continued (Pelliccia et al. 2012a). Often, the only recourse of those suspecting a pathological enlargement of the heart as a result of echocardiography was the undesirable approach of forbidding exercise, and watching whether the size of the myocardium then decreased to what were deemed \u201cnormal\u201d values (Fig. 9.4).\n\n\n",

Some investigators have argued that a small leakage of myocardial protein is a normal component of the process of cardiac hypertrophy (Shave and Oxbrough 2012) and that magnetic resonance and echocardiographic techniques show no associated deterioration of myocardial function following a bout of prolonged endurance exercise (Wilson et al. 2011). Others have insisted that if there is release of cardiac troponin, there must be some injury to heart muscle; they have linked their findings to small immediate changes in ventricular function that resolve within a week or so following endurance competition (LaGerche et al. 2008). This debate has yet to be resolved.",

Claude Beck (1894\u20131971), a surgeon at Case Western Reserve Hospital in Cleveland first applied a defibrillator to a human heart in 1947 CE. His patient was a 14-year-old boy undergoing surgery for a congenital cardiac defect, and the direct application of an alternating current by paddles placed on the ventricles restored a normal sinus heart rhythm. In the mid-1950s, two Russian Cardiologists (V. la Eskin and A.M. Klimov) began to experiment with applying larger alternating voltages (1,000 V or more) to the exterior of the chest cage. In 1959 CE, Bernard Lown (1921\u2013) of Harvard University suggested the alternative of applying a single direct current shock; this had a potential of perhaps 1,000 V, and an energy content of 100\u2013200 J, discharged over 5 ms (Eisenberg 2006). The Lown design held sway until the late 1980s, when it was shown that a biphasic truncated electrical waveform was even more effective (with rates for the reversal of fibrillation rising from 60 to 90 %). Lower voltages were also required for the biphasic device, thus reducing its weight, and allowing the development of portable versions for use outside of hospitals. A further improvement was the design of an automated defibrillator that could be used by untrained lay personnel; the new equipment was able to analyze the heart rhythm, determine chest impedance and apply a shock of appropriate magnitude.",

However, the first injection of radio-contrast material into the coronary artery occurred accidentally at the Cleveland Clinic in 1960 CE, when the left ventricular catheter of Mason Sones (1918\u20131985 CE) slipped into one of the coronary vessels. The patient went into cardiac arrest, but this was quickly reversed, and the potential value of the intra-coronary injection was quickly recognized.

As the protons return to their original position, they send out signals. These are fed to a computer, and images of the underlying tissue are created. Cardiac and respiratory movements initially complicated imaging of the heart, but this difficulty was largely solved in the 1980s by the use of an ECG-based gating of the image. For cardiac investigations, a contrast agent such as gadolinium is usually administered intravenously. One can thus visualize areas of heart muscle where the contrast material does not penetrate due to coronary narrowing or occlusion. Following infarction, the area of scarred muscle appears white, in contrast with dark, normally-perfused cardiac muscle.",

In 1979 CE, they were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this discovery (Hurlock et al. 2009). CT is not used routinely in clinical practice. The patient receives an intravenous injection of iodine, and the heart is then scanned by a high-speed CT scanner. The test has a high negative predictive value (93 %) but some 18 % of false positive results. It is thus more useful in ruling out coronary disease than in diagnosing it.

Thistle, a physician interested in muscular rehabilitation (Thistle et al. 1967). In 1967 CE, Perrin introduced the Cybex I isokinetic dynamometer (Perrin 1993), and this became commercially available three years later. The equipment was enhanced by adding a variety of servo-motors and microprocessors. Several forms of isokinetic dynamometer capable of assessing both concentric and eccentric effort became commercially available during the 1980s (Abernethy et al. 1995). Because of the high retail cost and large profit margins associated with modern isokinetic equipment, various civil court actions have debated patent rights to the underlying concepts.",

One immediate objection to the isokinetic testing of a single joint is that the results may not be representative of muscle strength in other body regions. Thus, one study of Australian football players found little relationship between the isokinetic strength of the quadriceps and their likelihood of developing hamstring injuries (Bennell et al. 1998).

However, in the 1960s, classification began to be based on enzyme profile, typing fibres as slow or fast twitch based upon their content of either myosin vs. actomyosin ATPase (Engel 1998), or oxidative vs. glycolytic enzymes (Barnard et al. 1971) (Fig. 9.6). For a while, there was considerable debate as to whether humans had an intermediate fibre type (IIx), but advances in muscle protein chemistry during the 1990s allowed resolution of this question. A variety of fibre types were defined very precisely in terms of their main protein constituents (Moss et al. 1995; MacIntosh et al. 2006).\n\n",

It is a safe, inexpensive and portable tool, and it allows the fitness professional to make quite rapid determinations. Originally conceived for blood flow measurements, it was first applied to the determination of total body water (and thus lean tissue mass) by Hoffer et al. (1969) and Nyboer (1970). The principle is simple: since fat has only 14\u201322 % of the water content of lean tissue, a fat person conducts an electrical signal much less readily than a thin person. The main problem arises from inter-individual differences in body shape, as most commercially available devices simply adjust the wrist to ankle impedance for the square of the person\u2019s height (Shephard 2011d).",

In 1938 CE, the Swedish Physician G. Vejlens further demonstrated an association between margination and erythrocyte aggregation. Much of the margination was flow dependent, but Crary et al.

This conclusion spurred an extensive study of the modulation of the activity of adhesion molecules by hormones such as the catecholamines (Shephard et al. 2000), and the relationship of such modulation to the immune responses observed during exercise.",

IL-6 was thus released into the blood as intramuscular glycogen stores became depleted. It appears that in addition to playing important roles in controlling responses to infection and injury, secretion of the cytokine IL-6 may make a significant contribution to metabolic regulation (Pedersen et al. 2004). The IL-6 gene is rapidly activated during exercise, and the IL-6 released from muscle can induce lipolysis, suppress TNF production and stimulate cortisol production, particularly when muscle stores of glycogen are low. Cytokines also seem to be important regulators of muscle protein turnover (Zoico and Roubenoff 2002).",

Likewise, maximal oxygen intakes averaging 88 mL/[kg.min] that have been reported for cross-country skiers (Bergh and Forsberg 2000) reflect as much a genetic advantage of body build (an ectomorphic frame, a low body fat content, and only moderate muscular development) as a response to years of rigorous endurance training.",

The mean gain in maximal oxygen intake was about 400 mL/min, but the range of reported response varied from 0 to 1 L/min (Bouchard et al. 2000). The immediate conclusion drawn from these experiments was that some members of the group lacked any ability to improve their physical condition by training. However, this view had to be modified when it was pointed out that about a half of apparent inter-individual differences in training response was simply an expression of laboratory errors in the measurement of maximal oxygen intake; the data obtained after training followed the well-known statistical principle of \u201cregression to the mean\u201d (Shephard 2003b; Shephard et al. 2004), obscuring the training response in those with high values at the initial test, and exaggerating it in those with low initial values. However, there were still substantial inter-individual differences in response after correcting for regression to the mean. Plainly, the inheritance of a high initial aerobic power and an above-average response to aerobic training give some individuals a substantial advantage in athletic events that require a large maximal oxygen intake.",

Further observations at the Montreal Olympic Games in 1976 CE again disclosed no differences of red cell antigens or enzymes between athletes and controls (Chagnon et al. 1984). However, the search has continued on a systematic basis (P\u00e9russe et al. 2013), and a growing number of statistically significant linkages have now been discovered. Individual gene variants have been linked to such factors as physical activity behaviour, cardiorespiratory fitness and endurance performance, muscle strength and power, body mass and adiposity, and characteristics of glucose and lipid metabolism. One recent study of 324,611 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified 21 SNPs which together appeared to account for about 49 % of inter-individual differences in the trainability of maximal oxygen intake (Bouchard et al. 2011). This has kindled fears that in the future, unscrupulous athletes may solicit deliberate genetic manipulation in order to give themselves a competitive advantage (\u201cgene doping\u201d), for example by boosting their endogenous production of erythropoietin or human growth hormone.",

Some competitors found negative effects from a disturbance of their normal training routines and life in an unaccustomed environment; moreover, tissue bicarbonate reserves were reduced, and at least initially there was a reduction of blood volume at altitude (Shephard 2000b). Thus, some Sports Scientists argued that athletes who were travelling to high altitudes could achieve a better performance by arriving immediately before competition, and racing before their buffering capacity and blood volume were depleted (Kirkendall 2011).",

Continued study of Kenyan and Ethiopian competitors has suggested that other factors may also contribute to their advantage- distance walking and running from an early age, a favourable somatotype, and a strong motivation to succeed as a means of social and economic advancement (Wilber and Pilsiladis 2012).",

Moreover, this physiological advantage persisted for several weeks, as the haemoglobin concentration only gradually reverted to its sea level norm. Mimicking the polycythaemia of the high altitude resident, some athletes attempted to gain an unfair competitive advantage by using other methods to boost their blood volume and/or their red cell count. Tactics included transfusion of their own (autologous) blood and administration of the erythropoietin that stimulates red cell production in the bone marrow (erythropoietin was first identified and extracted from urine in 1977 CE). Investigators at York University in Toronto played an important role in demonstrating the potential impact of this abuse upon maximal oxygen intake (Buick et al. 1980; Spriet et al. 1980, 1986). Anti-doping agencies are still struggling to regulate these abuses by such approaches as testing the blood or urine for evidence of exogenous erythropoietin, noting the ratio of reticulocytes to mature red cells in blood specimens, and requiring endurance athletes to keep a passport recording their haemoglobin levels on a regular basis throughout the year (Born\u00f8 et al. 2010; Garvican et al. 2010).",

Not only were athletes travelling to compete in hot environments, but the British government also wanted to deploy their troops from English barracks to tropical colonies and dependencies when emergencies developed. South African companies also wished to dig ever deeper gold and diamond mines, thus increasing the thermal stress on their labourers. Relevant research was undertaken by Sid Robinson in Bloomington, IN (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-11671-6_8), Otto Edholm (1909\u20131985 CE) and his colleagues at the British Medical Research Council, and by Cyril Wyndham (1916\u20131987 CE) at the Chamber of Mines Laboratories in Johannesburg. Robinson and his associates maintained that heat acclimatization could be achieved by an appropriate regimen of endurance training, even if this was undertaken in a cool environment (Piwonka et al. 1965). Certainly, a high level of fitness increases tolerance of hot environments, but in the early 1970s Wyndham and his colleagues demonstrated categorically that maximum acclimation required a combination of physical activity and heat exposure (Wyndham et al. 1973). Moreover, and unfortunately for the British military commanders, the full adaptive potential realized by residence in a tropical environment could not be achieved simply by exercising in a hot chamber (Edholm and Bacharach 1965).",

            "text": "One environmental issue that has attracted considerable controversy over the last 50 years has been the quantity of fluids that endurance athletes should ingest when competing under warm conditions (Table 9.5). Ekblom et al. (1970) suggested that even a 1 % decrease of body mass increased the rise of rectal temperature when a person was exercising in the heat at 60 % of maximal oxygen intake. However, much depends upon whether the exercise depletes muscle and liver reserves of glycogen. During the 1970s, we established that in marathon runners, the liberation of water associated with the glycogen molecule could allow a 2 % decrease of body mass with little net dehydration (Shephard and Kavanagh 1975; Shephard et al. 1975). Fluid intake could usefully include a modest pre-event drink of 500 mL, and a further 150 mL of fluid should be ingested in each subsequent 15 min of running, to match the likely rate of fluid absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract during vigorous exercise (Shephard and Kavanagh 1975). In terms of maintaining hydration during competition, water was shown to be as effective a replacement fluid as proprietary sports drinks (Costill et al. 1975; Kavanagh and Shephard 1977), and indeed the plasma sodium concentrations of water drinkers were typically increased rather than decreased at the end of a distance run (Table 9.5). Weighing offered a simple means of estimating final over- or under-dehydration, if due allowance was made for the water liberated from stored glycogen (a total of up to 2 l). However, Carl Gisolfi (1942\u20132000 CE) continued to argue that runners should drink a dilute glucose mixture (<6 %) to reduce the rate of glycogen depletion. He established that a glucose/electrolyte mixture emptied from the stomach almost as rapidly as water (Ryan et al. 1989), and that at intensities of effort demanding less than 70 % of maximal oxygen intake, fluid absorption from the small intestine proceeded almost as fast as at rest (Gisolfi et al. 1991).\n\n",

Evidence of adaptation was seen in the Korean Ama pearl divers (Hong et al. 1987) and bushmen exposed to the cold nights of the Australian desert (Hammel et al. 1959). Eric Glaser and I also established that it was possible to acclimatize to hot and cold conditions simultaneously (Glaser and Shephard 1963), with the subjects feeling more comfortable and shivering less under cold conditions. The body temperatures of those who have been acclimatized often drop to lower temperatures than in those who are not accustomed to cold conditions, suggesting that much of the apparent benefit may be no more than habituation to various unpleasant sensations. However, Jacques LeBlanc, working with Qu\u00e9becois fishermen in the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, demonstrated that there was also some local vascular adaptation, in that those who were used to immersing their hands in cold water showed a lesser rise of blood pressure than those unaccustomed to this stimulus (LeBlanc 1975).",

In the seventeenth century, Ramazzini (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-11671-6_6) noted that bakers, inn-keepers and soldiers were often required to work at unusual times of the day, and during the early part of the industrial revolution, workers also had to contend with very long hours of employment. But by 2001 CE, it was estimated that a fifth of European workers were engaged in shift work, and about one in 20 employees worked extended hours, sometimes associated with a compressed working week (Harrington 2001). Adverse health effects that have been associated with shift work include a reduction in the quality and quantity of sleep, fatigue and resulting injuries, anxiety, depression and neuroticism, a 40 % increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease (possibly due to increased smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise, B\u00f8ggild and Knuttson 1999), gastrointestinal disorders (again probably related to the poor diet available to shift workers), disruption of the menstrual cycle and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Studies of alternative shift arrangements have suggested that the least harmful is a rapid clockwise 8-h rotation (morning, afternoon, night); attention must also be paid to the recreational, dietary and transportation needs of the night shift, and the provision of bright lighting may possibly help night-time adaptation (Harrington 2001).",

Benefit was optimized if the light exposure continued for 6\u20138 h per night for 4 days before the shift of rhythm, and dark glasses were worn during the daytime to minimize exposure to natural sunlight. Although the secretion of melatonin is involved in setting the circadian rhythm, attempts to speed adjustments by therapeutic use of melatonin have had only limited success, in part because of side effects of the drug, and in part because of unfavourable pharmacokinetics when it is administered orally (Turek and Gillette 2004).",

Nixon responded with a health care plan that provided Medicaid for low-income families with dependent children, and required that all employees be provided with health care.

These events led to a rapid decline in his popularity. However, early in his first term of office he had increased funding to the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, and he had attempted to address the issue of poorly performing inner city schools with the \u201cNo child left behind\u201d Act (Zelizer 2010). After his re-election, he also signed into law Medicare benefits for seniors that subsidized the purchase of prescription drugs, at a cost of some $40 B/yr. The Medicare plan covered some 25 million seniors, each with their own private account. An aide, John Goodman, explained gleefully that the details of this plan made it almost impossible to Socialize. At the same time, the government lost any chance to negotiate wholesale prices for medications, or to import cheaper alternatives from overseas (Zelizer 2010). George W. opposed expansion of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which would have provided medical care to an additional four million children from poor families, seeing this as a step towards Socialized medicine. He supported adult stem cell research, but used his Presidential veto to oppose embryonic stem cell research. He committed $15 B to the fight against the global HIV/AIDS epidemic over the period 2003\u20132008 CE (Zelizer 2010).",

Over four and a half days of meetings, around 1,000 scientists from many parts of the world gathered in Toronto to develop a consensus on the health benefits of regular exercise. The findings were subsequently published (Bouchard et al. 1990). A similar event (again chaired by Claude Bouchard) was held in Toronto in 1992 CE. On this occasion, a computer search of the literature identified the best-informed international investigators to lead discussion on each of some 70 topics. After detailed review, editing and group approval, the final conclusions were published as a major scientific text (Bouchard et al. 1994) (Fig. 9.19). Since information was still lacking on the optimal dose of exercise for many of the conditions that were identified, Dr. Bouchard and his colleagues embarked on a third consensus conference in October of 2000 CE. This focused specifically on dose-response relationships. Unfortunately, evidence still proved insufficient to make clear dose-response statements for many of the clinical conditions that were considered at this gathering (Kesaniemi et al. 2001).\n\n",

The CSEP programme was created and administered by Dr. Norman Gledhill from York University, Toronto. CSEP currently recognizes two levels of Certification: the CSEP Certified Exercise Physiologist\u00ae (CSEP-CEP) and the CSEP-Certified Personal Trainer, and it provides appropriate continuing education for its members through its Annual General Meeting. The person recognized as a CSEP-CEP possesses advanced formal academic preparation and practical experience in both health-related, and performance-related physical activity/exercise science fitness applications for non-clinical and clinical populations (CSEP 2014).",

However, the scientific use of pedometers by epidemiologists depended upon the development of accurate and inexpensive electronic devices. Y. Hatano marketed the first reliable electronic pedometer in Tokyo in 1965 CE, and he used it in a campaign to encourage wearers to take 10,000 steps/day (Tudor-Locke\n2003). The best of currently available pedometers, such as the Kenz Lifecorder, can now record 500 paces on a track with an accuracy of -0.2+1.5 steps (Schneider et al. 2003). Their performance is necessarily somewhat less precise when measuring the wider range of activities encountered in normal daily living, but they can monitor activity patterns continuously for periods of 30\u201360 days, and they are enabling earlier questionnaire-based epidemiological studies to be repeated with much greater confidence in the patterns of activity that are identified (Aoyagi and Shephard 2009).\n\n",

An incident that killed five workers during the construction of a tunnel in Toronto spurred passage of the Industrial Safety Act in 1964 CE; this legislation defined safety as \u201cfreedom from injury to the body and freedom from damage to health.\u201d In Canada, concern continued about the hazards associated with work in uranium and asbestos mines and exposure to lead and mercury, and a Royal Commission was appointed, led by James Ham. One outcome of this Commission was the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1980 CE; this gave workers the rights to participate in discussions of occupational health, to know the risks, and to refuse work that they believed to be unsafe. The legislation was further strengthened in 1991 CE, with a requirement for a Joint Health and Safety Committee that included management and worker representatives certified by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (Public Services Health & Safety Association 2014).",

In 1848 CE, a young physician named Rudolph Virchow (1821\u20131902 CE) (Fig. 9.22) was sent to investigate an epidemic of typhus in Silesian coal-miners, and he wrote a scathing report on conditions in that industry which cost him his job at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin (Abrams 2001). Virchow wrote (Ashton 2006):\nMedicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale. Medicine, as a social science, as the science of human beings, has the obligation to point out problems and to attempt their theoretical solution: the politician, the practical anthropologist, must find the means for their actual solution\u2026 The physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor, and social problems fall to a large extent within their jurisdiction\nIn part as a result of Virchow\u2019s concerns, Bismark introduced a system of workmen\u2019s compensation in Germany as early as 1884 CE. Similar legislation was not enacted in New York until 1910 CE, and Mississippi was the final State to make such provision in 1948 CE.\n\n",

Although the general tenor of advice has been consistent, the details of these recommendations have inevitably differed somewhat one from another, and this has had the unfortunate effect of causing the general public to be sceptical about all of the advice that has been offered (Shephard 2002). Interestingly, the WHO (World Health Organisation 1985) and Canadian experts have at times urged a weekly volume of physical activity greater than that being recommended in other countries such as the U.S., with Canadian groups arguing that in order to counter one of North America\u2019s most urgent current health problems, the obesity epidemic, the required volume of exercise might need to exceed 150 min of moderate aerobic activity per week.\n\n",

Tertiary cardiac programmes first began to appear during the 1950s (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-11671-6_8). Soon after the Toronto International Symposium on Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Disease of 1966 CE, the Toronto Rehabilitation Centre (TRC), in association with the University of Toronto, began its tertiary cardiac rehabilitation programme under the direction of Terence Kavanagh. This quickly progressed to become one of the world\u2019s leading cardiac programmes. Kavanagh initially offered medically supervised programmes of progressive and relatively vigorous aerobic rehabilitation to individuals who had sustained a myocardial infarction. He subsequently extended suitably adapted variants of this programme to individuals who had developed a stable cardiac failure or who had received a cardiac transplant.",

One was the collection of detailed physiological data on all patients, including direct measurements of peak oxygen intake, and accurate determinations of the ST depression induced by vigorous exercise, using an electrical signal-averaging device. The data thus obtained allowed Kavanagh to offer carefully individualized exercise prescriptions of an appropriate intensity. Other cardiac rehabilitation facilities offered a brief (2\u20133 month) course of standardized thrice-weekly group classes, with supervision by a Nurse or Physiotherapist. However, the TRC recognized that poor compliance with such programmes reflected the large amount of time that was often spent in travelling to and from the rehabilitation centre, and the limited guidance that the patient received on arrival at the facility. All TRC sessions were thus medically supervised, with individualized exercise prescriptions and detailed group discussion of exercise-induced symptoms and practical problems of rehabilitation prior to each class session. Patients attended the centre only once per week, to minimize driving time, but they also completed at least four more carefully prescribed home sessions each week, with compliance monitored by completion of a detailed \u201cexercise log\u201d (Kavanagh 1976). Although many of the standard rehabilitation programmes had a 6-month compliance rate of under 50 %, Kavanagh achieved a complianc rate of 82 % with his approach.",

Thus, when data were reanalyzed post hoc, in terms of those who had improved their physical condition versus those who had not, an advantage was indeed seen in the more active of the two cohorts (Cunningham et al. 1990).",

Some at first attributed benefit simply to an increase of motivation, a desensitization to dyspnoea and an improved mechanical efficiency of walking (Belman 1986). However, it was later appreciated that many investigators were using too low an intensity of effort, and with an adequate stimulus physiological adaptations could develop in those with COPD, including a lesser production of lactate in strengthened muscles (Casaburi et al. 1991) and increased muscle enzyme activity (American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society 1999).",

Anti-smoking groups developed in Germany following World War I, and a magazine (Deutsche Tabakgegner; German Tobacco Opponents) was published from 1919 to 1935 CE (Lickint 1929).

The epidemic officially began in the U.S. in 1981 CE, when the Centers for Disease Control reported a clustering of cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia in homosexual men in Los Angeles. The concentration among homosexual individuals suggested the possibility of a sexually-transmitted disease (Centers for Disease Control 1982) and the syndrome was initially named GRID (gay-related immune disorder). However, it was quickly realized that the condition was not limited to homosexual individuals, but was seen also in intravenous drug users, haemophiliacs and others receiving blood transfusions. Thus, in August 1982, CDC coined the new term AIDS. The virus responsible for the disease was discovered the following year by Luc Montagnier and his associates at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi et al. 1983).",

Because the Directorate was regarded as a junior ministry, the incumbent Minister was usually a young and ambitious politician, who remained in this particular office for only 1\u20132 years before moving on to a more prestigious Cabinet appointment. In order to make his or her mark, the emphasis of the Directorate was shifted with each new appointee. One incumbent thought it appropriate to focus upon the importance of sport programming, and the next emphasized the need to enhance the fitness of the general population. As in most government departments around the world, there were also frequent changes of name and administrative organization. In 1971 CE, two directorates (Sport Canada and Recreation Canada) were created within the Fitness and Amateur Sports Programme. Sport Canada was supposed to concentrate its activities on competitive sport at national and international levels, and Recreation Canada was charged with increasing the public\u2019s awareness of the importance of fitness and recreation in everyday life. Recreation Canada was renamed Fitness and Recreation Canada in 1977 CE, and two additional Directorates (Programme Operations and Administration, and Planning, Research and Evaluation) were created. The responsibilities of Recreation Canada now included programming for sport and recreational organizations, natives, and disabled persons, encouraging a healthy lifestyle through physical activity, and coordinating Federal fitness activities with those of the Provinces. Fitness Canada was formed in 1979 CE from the fitness and recreation branches of the Fitness and Amateur Sports Directorate. In 1979 and 1980 CE, responsibility oscillated with alarming rapidity between National Health & Welfare, the Secretary of State and the Minister of Labour. By 1993 CE, Fitness and Amateur Sport comprised three divisions, entitled Sport Canada, Fitness Canada, and International Relations and Major Games. A final reorganization occurred in 1993 CE. This abolished the post of Minister of State for Fitness and Amateur Sports, and the functions of the programme were split between the Minister of Health (Fitness) and the Minister of Canadian Heritage (Sports). This arrangement was confirmed in 2003 CE, with enactment of the new Physical Activity and Sport Act.",

Because of the regional realities of Canadian politics, it was decided to locate these units in Edmonton, Montreal and Toronto. Each unit received an annual grant of $50,000 for five years, at that time a budget that was sufficient to pay the salaries of two Academic staff, two technicians and a secretary, and to cover the purchase of a limited quantity of equipment and supplies. Doctoral programmes in the Exercise Sciences were quickly launched in both Toronto and in Edmonton, with Terence Anderson in Toronto becoming the first Canadian Ph.D. Exercise Science graduate, in 1966 CE. Another early initiative of the Toronto Fitness Research Unit, with the support of Fitness Canada, the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation, the Ontario Heart Association and the Canadian Medical Association, was the hosting of the world\u2019s first International Symposium on Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Disease. This event took place in October of 1966 CE at Toronto\u2019s Inn-on-the Park. It attracted more than 600 delegates, and a well-edited conference proceedings appeared as two special issues of the Canadian Medical Association Journal within 5 months of holding the symposium (Shephard 1967a).",

Two years later, Dr. Joseph S. Weiner, the South African-born Physical Anthropologist and Director of the Human Adaptability Project of the International Biological Programme invited the Toronto Fitness Research Unit to coordinate that part of the IBP Human Adaptability Project that was dealing with world-wide comparisons of human physiological work capacity and fitness. Individual laboratories were generous in contributing data, and a comprehensive picture was established of fitness levels in many parts of the world (Fig. 9.25). Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of habitat upon fitness seemed relatively minor. It was speculated that in harsh environments, survival depended more upon accumulated hunting skills than upon the unusual development of aerobic power or muscular strength (Shephard 1978).\n\n",

Such evaluations had a marked negative impact upon children who \u201cfailed\u201d one or more items in the test battery. In response to this criticism, the CAHPER performance test (Canadian Association for Physical Education and Recreation 1966) moved to the classification of an individual\u2019s scores in terms of age and sex-specific percentiles. But during the late 1960s, it was demonstrated that even if the results of performance tests were reported as percentiles, the achievements on many measures still depended more upon an individual\u2019s body size than upon his or her physical fitness (Cumming and Keynes 1967; Drake et al. 1968).",

However, when a Nation-wide survey of fitness in adults. was being planned, it did not seem feasible to carry cycle ergometers to thousands of homes scattered widely across the country. Thus, a simple step test was chosen as a field measure of the individual\u2019s aerobic fitness. The concept of estimating maximal oxygen intake from an individual\u2019s performance on a progressive, sub-maximal double nine-inch step test had originated with the Toronto International Working Party on aerobic fitness measurement, above (Shephard et al. 1968b). When using this type of step-test in Igloolik, Nunavut, our attempts to explain the stepping procedure in a halting form of Inuktituk had limited success. However, I found that the Inuit quickly learned to climb and descend the steps at the correct cadence if I sang the rhythm to them on a rising followed by a descending scale, using the Inuit words for 1, 2, 3.... I discussed this finding with representatives of ParticipACTION and Fitness Canada, and in 1973 CE we decided to develop a Home Fitness Test Kit around an LP recording of music that set a stepping rhythm appropriate to a person\u2019s age and sex (Fig. 9.26). The idea was generally well received, although a Winnipeg cardiologist (Gordon Cumming; Cumming and Glenn 1977) questioned the ability of either health professionals or the general population to palpate heart rates with sufficient accuracy. He further commented that at least on his record player the speed of the music slowed as the centre of the LP disc was approached (this problem has since been overcome, as the use of tapes and CDs now provide a standard musical cadence for the test).\n\n",

The clearance instrument was checked further relative to physician-based screening at the Pacific National Exhibition (Chisholm et al. 1975), and the PAR-Q test was born from this research. Over almost four decades of widespread use around the world, the PAR-Q has proven a very safe and effective screening procedure. The one drawback has been the referral of a rather high proportion of potential exercisers to their physician for final clearance. Minor rewordings of the questionnaire (Fig. 9.27) failed to correct this problem (Thomas et al. 1992), and during the last 3 years Darren Warburton and his colleagues have developed a new Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+) and an appropriately-branched electronic form of the questionnaire to introduce supplementary \u201cprobing\u201d questions in clinical conditions where the safety of testing is still unclear (Warburton et al. 2011c).\n\n",

In the early 1960s, the International Biological Programme considered that recording physical activity patterns on two weekdays and two week-end days (Weiner and Lourie 1969) was adequate to obtain representative data. However, this necessarily ignored seasonal effects, which can be quite large in some climates. More recent studies, where recording has extended over an entire year, have demonstrated that substantially longer periods of observation are necessary to obtain reliable information, particularly on the behaviour of single individuals. Not only is there a strong likelihood that the wearing of a physical activity monitor may have an immediate reactive effect, encouraging an abnormally high level of exercise for a week or more, but there are also substantial variations in activity patterns attributable to seasonal changes in temperature, periods of adverse weather and other variables (Shephard and Aoyagi 2010). Although not always easy to organize, it has been demonstrated that the most economical method of obtaining representative data is to randomize observations in terms of both day of the week and month of the year.",

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has also drawn attention to the decreasing physical demands imposed upon adults by private industry (which accounts for about a half of the total labour force in the U.S.). The U.S. analysis is based upon the changing distribution of employment, but does not take account of a second important factor: the progressive decrease of energy expenditure within a given category of employment. In the early 1970s, almost a half of the jobs that were reported to the Bureau required at least a moderate intensity of physical activity, but now this is true for less than 20 % of private-sector workers (Church et al. 2011). Based on such calculations, the average energy expenditure of a typical U.S. worker has decreased by at least 400 kJ/day over the past 40 years, with a roughly commensurate increase in body mass.",

However, the level of competition has increased steeply over the Post-Modern Era, and some athletes and their coaches have adopted the maxim that if a little training is good, more is undoubtedly better. This has not always proven to be the case. Sometimes, performance has deteriorated as weekly training schedules have been increased, and in some instances there have also been adverse clinical manifestations such as an increased vulnerability to upper respiratory infections (MacKinnon and Hooper 1994; Shephard 1997b). The affected competitors are said to be over-reaching, or over-trained.

This was an unusual recommendation for his time. In the period before World-War II, many jobs required hard physical labour, and the attitude of Russian occupational hygienists was more typical. They argued that the demands of daily physical labour already imposed a dangerously heavy physiological load on a large proportion of Russian workers, and any added exercise might cause irreparable damage to health (Cantelon 1982).\n\n",

He was particularly concerned to maintain the health and fitness of his work force, ensuring that park and recreation areas were incorporated into plans for the village; he encouraged swimming, walking and outdoor sports, and laid out football and hockey pitches together with a running track (Tolman 1901). Likewise, in the U.S., the Pullman railcar company, established an athletic association for its employees as early as 1879 CE, and in the 1880s, the president of National Cash Register (NCR) was reputed to meet with his employees for horseback rides before work; later, NCR instituted twice-daily exercise breaks, built an employee gym, and constructed a 325-acre recreation park for its workers. Hershey Foods built a recreation complex, complete with a swimming pool, in the 1930s, and in the 1950s and 1960s Texas Instruments, Rockwell and Xerox Corporations all instituted employee fitness programmes (Chenoweth 2006).\n\n",

The Canadian government thus welcomed the potential of work-site fitness initiatives as a low-cost and focussed alternative that could address the needs of the working population. A key stimulus to this new governmental initiative was a conference on Employee Fitness, convened in Ottawa in 1974 (Collis 1976). Papers presented at this meeting suggested that the costs of such work-site programmes would usually be borne by the employer and/or the worker rather than the government, and that the sponsoring companies might reap such dividends as an enhanced corporate image, the recruitment of premium employees, greater productivity, less absenteeism, and reduced health insurance costs.",

This organization was subsequently renamed the Association for Worksite Health Promotion (AWHP), reflecting a shift of its objectives from simple fitness programming to more broadly-based wellness initiatives that addressed such issues as work-place stress, low back-problems, obesity and addictions. By the early 1990s, the U.S. group was boasting a membership of some 2,500. But around this time, many companies undertook a critical reappraisal of the loudly touted fiscal benefits of worksite wellness programmes; finding only limited evidence for their efficacy, funding was slashed, and this led to a rapid demise of the AWHP. Nevertheless, a worksite health promotion \u201cinterest group\u201d continued at the American College of Sports Medicine, and in 2009 an International Association for Worksite Health Promotion made its d\u00e9but. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 2012) have also continued their support of worksite health promotion.",

Even if admission was technically open to all classes of employee, programmes often failed to attract the blue-collar segment of the labour force. The Canadian Public Health Association thus initiated a project with a specific focus on blue collar employees (Canadian Public Health Association 1979), and in the U.S. the American Heart Association convened a meeting to examine the needs of hourly workers (Meyers 1987). One suggestion emerging from the latter conference was that the blue-collar group might be attracted more by team sports than by light aerobic-type gymnastics.",

Most \u201cinvestigations\u201d were simple \u201cbefore and after\u201d comparisons, devoid of any control groups. Even when findings were reported dispassionately, the responses of workers were thus vulnerable to a fallacious \u201cHawthorne\u201d effect (a favourable response kindled by a perception of greater management interest in their welfare). But often the observers, anxious to keep their own jobs, made over-optimistic assessments of programme success. During the 1980s, I recall visiting one factory in Holland with supposedly the best work-site fitness programme in that country. I was shown a beautiful gymnasium, but at what I supposed was the peak hour for exercise (around 12 noon), there were just two exercisers in the facility!",

Findings at the experimental site (the head office of the Canada Life Company, Fig. 9.30) before and in the year following initiation of the work-site fitness programme were compared with those at a well-matched control site (the nearby North American Life Assurance Company). Minor economic benefits were documented at the experimental site: increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, and reduced employee turnover relative to the control site. But the unique feature of the Canada Life Study was a direct comparison of Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) Medicare billings (both the nature of diagnoses and the dollar payments disbursed to hospitals and physicians) for employees at experimental and control companies (Shephard 1986b). Some sceptics had argued that a fitness programme would increase immediate medical costs, particularly for the treatment of musculo-skeletal injuries and for cardiac problems. However, the OHIP data showed small decreases in doctor and hospital visits by employees at the experimental work-site once the programme was in operation. Not only was the overall number of medical consultations reduced, but there were also fewer claims for such specific diagnoses as musculo-skeletal injuries and cardiac problems.\n\n",

Despite the vigorous publicity that one would anticipate with an experimental study, only about a third of employees were initially recruited to the programme, and the participation of many of these individuals flagged over the first year of observation. We were also able to obtain information on long-term adherence, and 12 years after initiation of the programme only a very small group of employees were actively using the exercise facility (Shephard 1992). One major problem, probably generic to large cities, was that long commuting distances limited the involvement of many employees in exercise programmes before or after work. From the viewpoint of population health, the downtown exercise facility also did not cater either to the families of employees or to the growing number of people who worked from home. In terms of enhancing National fitness, a further limitation of work-site fitness programmes is that for logistic reasons such initiatives are largely restricted to companies with more than 100 employees (Linnan et al. 2008), and companies of this size are in the minority, particularly in Canada. One potential alternative, recently adopted by some small organisations, has been to subsidize membership of a commercial fitness club (Lucove et al. 2007).",

In many operations, productivity had become a function of advanced technology rather than human physical input, so that the potential for a greater physical working capacity to augment output was necessarily reduced. Partly for this reason, the emphasis of many work-site programmes shifted from the development of physical abilities to the enhancement of overall employee function, including mental and psychological health. Some altruistic companies have seen the provision of a broadly-based health service as a worthy goal in its own right, and in the U.S., others have hoped that such an emphasis might counter ever-rising medical insurance premiums, a management cost still included in many union contracts.",

They argued that Section 4(1) of the Ontario Human Rights Code prohibited their employer from discriminating in the hiring or firing of workers, based on their race, creed, colour, age, sex, marital status, nationality, ancestry or place of origin. However, the Borough of Etobicoke pointed out that Section 4(1) of the legislation does not apply where age is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). In other words, if age is affecting your ability to be a capable firefighter, then you can indeed lose your job because of your age. The issue was appealed to the Canadian Supreme Court. In 1999 CE, this body ruled that a BFOR must be \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d and it set specific guidelines to evaluate BFOR tests and standards. This judgment prompted extensive research by Occupational Physiologists, particularly a group at York University led by Norman Gledhill. Their mission was to determine the physical demands of various occupations where public safety was at stake, and to design appropriate, job-related tests to determine the physical competence of employees who wished to continue working beyond the normal retirement age (Gledhill et al. 2001). The legislation still only regulates employment for those between the ages of 18 and 65 years. The Equity in Employment Act also became law in 1986 CE; it forced an equally careful consideration of the fitness capabilities of female employees.",

Congresses take place approximately every 4 years. The most recent (8th) Conference was held in Glasgow (2012 CE). The Journal of Physical Activity & Aging, now in its 22nd year, has become the official organ of this coalition.

Recognizing that test failure could have a negative impact on the students concerned, the U.S. moved to a percentile-based fitness award system in 1991 CE. A Presidential Award was given to students scoring at or above the 85th percentile on all six criteria; a National Physical Fitness Award was presented to students who scored above the 50th percentile on all criteria, and students who participated, but fell below the 50th percentile on one or more tests still received a Participant Physical Fitness Award. This programme ended with the 2012\u20132013 school year; it has been replaced by the Presidential youth fitness programme with a FITNESSGRAM\u00ae assessment.

The U.S. were assigned responsibility for the village of Wainwright, Alaska, the Scandinavians investigated some small coastal settlements in Greenland, and our Toronto laboratory evaluated the Inuit community of Igloolik, near the tip of the Melville Peninsula (Fig. 9.32). For various reasons, the American and Scandinavian investigators obtained rather limited data sets. However, we were able to establish and operate a field station in the village of Igloolik for some 20 years (1970\u20131990 CE), repeatedly collecting extensive data on all willing villagers from primary school to old age. When our observations began, in 1969/70 CE, the fitness levels of the Inuit population were very high relative to people living in Southern Canada in terms of such criteria as maximal oxygen intake, muscle strength and obesity levels. Moreover, data collected during summer and winter hunting expeditions documented the very high daily energy expenditures that were required when the Inuit engaged in many of the community\u2019s traditional hunting activities (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-11671-6_1).\n\n",

It remains to be determined whether physical education had a direct positive effect upon the learning of academic material, whether it stimulated the production of neutrotrophins, or whether the observed benefits arose less directly (through such mechanisms as enhancement of a child\u2019s self-image, an increase of attention and better classroom behaviour on the part of the active pupils, or a shortening of teaching time and thus less exhaustion of the academic teachers following introduction of the new programme).",

Because of trans-continental travel costs, attendance at some early meetings of CASS was sparse, and the economics of Annual Conferences was further compromised by simultaneous translation of most of sessions into French. Moreover, by 1969 the Physicians were busy organizing an independent Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine (CASM), now the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine (CASEM). This allowed achievement of what for them had long been a major goal, the establishment of a Canadian Medical Association-recognized specialty certification in Sports Medicine. Those members of CASS with interests in Biomechanics, Sociology, Psychology, and Psychomotor Learning also began to organize their own specialized conferences. The issue of \u201cscientific separatism\u201d was debated vigorously at several Annual Meetings of CASS, and some expressed the hope that CASS could still function as an umbrella organization for the disparate factions. But reluctantly, it was eventually recognized that only the Exercise Physiologists were strongly committed to CASS, and in 1993 CE the group was rebranded as the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology. The new and more focussed format attracted a growing attendance. Currently, the Annual Meeting includes 2\u20133 days of scientific papers, and a final day when topics of interest to Certified Exercise Professionals are also presented.",

Five of the Palestinian kidnappers were also killed, and the remaining 3 were captured but later released following the hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner.

The total cost of the security precautions in London was estimated at $15B, although Britain was at this time struggling with a deep recession and a high rate of unemployment. At the Sochi Winter Games of 2014, the total costs of the event rose to $51 B, $39 billion in excess of initial estimates; much of this cost was attributable to rigid security precautions, with some 40,000 police and army personnel in attendance. The entire Sochi area became a \u201cring of steel,\u201d and in order to enter the controlled zone, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with x-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners.

The Oval has since been converted to a multi-purpose sports facility, but it remains a financial albatross, saddling the City of Richmond with large annual costs, to the point that some city councillors are agitating for it to be converted to a Convention Centre. The sports interest of the 18,500 volunteers who assisted at the 2010 Games was undoubtedly stimulated, at least transiently.

Several recent American Presidents have played team sports, but in Canada some politicians have shown greater interest in outdoor recreation than in sport. The increasing longevity of Western populations speaks to better overall health. The epidemic of cardiovascular disease has now been partially contained, but it has given place to a growing prevalence of obesity and diabetes. The Lalonde Report, the Romanow Commission, the Ottawa Charter and a series of consensus conferences have all underlined the need to focus upon prevention rather than the treatment of disease. Relationships between physical activity and disease prevention are now better understood, and several new journals discuss such issues. Occupational health and cardiac rehabilitation programmes have attracted growing interest, and the U.S. finally has a scheme for Nation-wide health insurance. Important developments in the study of fitness have included the standardization of exercise test methodology, and the development of appropriate tools for population screening and field-testing. National surveys have provided benchmarks of current health and fitness status. Quasi-experimental studies have demonstrated the benefits of enhanced physical education for school children, and the costs and benefits of worksite fitness programmes. The minimum fitness needed in physically demanding occupations has been defined in the context of human rights legislation, and the importance of regular physical activity has been demonstrated in the context of an aging population. Attempts to enhance physical activity in the general population through Fitness awards and government-sponsored agencies such as ParticipACTION have had only limited success. The emphasis in School Physical Education programmes has shifted from the promotion of sports teams to the teaching of physical activities that will carry over into adult life, and many Universities now offer doctoral programmes in Exercise Sciences and Kinesiology. International-level sports programmes have received growing support from governments and commercial sponsors, with a multiplication of the corresponding professional associations. High-risk activities such as mountain biking, Himalayan trekking, snow- and skate-boarding, windsurfing, parachuting, hang-gliding and rock-climbing have grown in popularity. International competitions now cater to women, para-athletes and the elderly, but the Olympic Games have lost their earlier idealism. Back-room laboratories are pitted against one another in a search for legal or illegal means to enhance performance. Doping, sex and age scandals, physical attacks on opponents and biased judging sully top-level competition, and cheating is a concern even in the Paralympic Games. The costs of international competition have also become enormous, and claims that such expenses are offset by a beneficial impact upon public health and fitness seem highly doubtful.",
