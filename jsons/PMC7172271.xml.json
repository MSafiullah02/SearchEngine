Despite a significant and growing body of evidence to implicate HRVs in more serious clinical outcomes (Gern and Busse, 1999, Hayden, 2004), the presence and role of more than 100 genetically and serologically distinct HRVs in illness is often unexplored. Additionally, the viruses themselves are not considered to be individual entities with distinct circulation patterns as other respiratory viruses are. Studies have produced unusual HRV-like sequences or made cursory reports of untypeable or variant HRV strains in the United Kingdom (Mori and Clewley, 1994), Switzerland (Deffernez et al., 2004), Finland (Savolainen et al., 2002), Belgium (Loens et al., 2006), Australia (Arden et al., 2006) and the United States (Lamson et al., 2006).

Complete VP1 sequences from all known HRV and HEV serotypes were available for comparison to the prototype strain of HRV-QPM, 001. These data further confirmed that HRV-QPM was similar but distinct from other known HEVs and HRVs (Fig. 3a and b and Table 2\n) most likely representing a novel serotype within the HRV-A species. Importantly, the putative HRV-QPM VP1 is 6\u201322 amino acids shorter than that of any other HRV serotype because of several deletions. Additional in silico studies predicted that infection by HRV-QPM is not likely to respond to treatment with the capsid binding antiviral, Pleconaril. To date all other members of the HRV-A species have proven susceptible to this antiviral compound. Two amino acids reportedly conserved among all HRV-B viruses (Ledford et al., 2004), were altered in the HRV-QPM VP1 sequence (Fig. 4\n). Using the amino acid numbering system from our study, the HRV-QPM-specific changes were Tyr152 to Phe and a hydrophilic Thr in place of a hydrophobic Val191 or Leu191. Changes at position 152 and 191 are implicated in complete resistance to the antiviral among naturally occurring HRV-B species (Ledford et al., 2005).",

Consequently, the genus Rhinovirus has been poorly characterised by modern standards; only six unique genomes from over 100 HRV serotypes currently reside on GenBank. The paucity of sequence data undoubtedly parallels our understanding of individual serotypes. In a time when molecular diagnostics are considered the gold standard, a lack of sequence reduces our detection capabilities and therefore limits our understanding of the seasonal distribution and recurrence of each serotype.

Numbering based on the HRV-QPM sequence (EF186077). The 25 residues of the pleconaril binding pocket are arrowed (majority HRV-B amino acid sequence listed below each arrow, Ledford et al., 2005). Two regions, indicated by overhead lines, appeared to be absent in HRV-QPM when compared with all other HRV VP1 sequences on GenBank (representative data shown here). Two residues predicted by Ledford to convey complete antiviral resistance to natural HRV-B strains (e.g. in HRV-5 and 14) are indicated by stars. Residues identical to HRV-QPM are indicated by dots.
