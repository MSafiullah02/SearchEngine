ELISA and Enzyme linked immunospot assay were performed for investigating cytokines production after virus challenge in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Besides, the protection ability of VLPs was assessed by passive protection assay in suckling mice. The recombinant DENV-1/2 VLPs were successfully expressed with \u03b1-factor secretion signal. Sera of mice immunized with monovalent and bivalent VLPs elevated the specific antibodies level comparable to inactivated virions group. The monovalent and bivalent VLPs induced specific cellular immune response as confirmed by ELISPOT. The PRNT 50 titers of monovalent and bivalent VLPs sera against DENV-1/2 were different ranging from 16 to 64. Moreover, anti-monovalent and anti-bivalent DENV VLPs sera displayed protective capacity in survival rate and morbidity. Monovalent and bivalent VLPs showed attracting vaccine effect for dengue virus. The multivalent VLPs may be promising for preventing different types of dengue virus.",

Currently, numerous vaccines for DENV infection are in development and clinical evaluation, such as inactivated whole virus, live attenuated DENV, recombinant subunit protein, DNA and virus-vectored vaccine (5-7). However, a successful DENV vaccine that can protect against all the DENV types is not available by now. Therefore, the safe and effective DENV vaccine is in urgent need. In recent years, noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs) formed in flavivirus replication have attracted many attentions. Many studies devoted to the rapid and effective construction of recombinant VLPs which possessed similar properties of native virions and lacked the viral genome (8, 9) . But the evidence concerning the DENV VLPs as vaccine candidate for dengue is insufficient.",

It is reported that DENV E protein has many B-cell-specific epitopes that can stimulate B cells to produce neutralization antibodies against virus infection (32, 33) .

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\uf061), is a modulator of cell immunization involved in systemic inflammation, and has been reported to have the ability to inhibit viral replications (37). Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), known as immune interferon, is also found to be a critical antiviral mediator (38). Moreover, IL-10 (interleukin-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, plays key role in immune response. These cytokines (TNF-\uf061, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10) are all closely associated with the immunopathogenesis of virus infection (39) . Therefore, in this study, the levels of these cytokines were investigated to explore the cellar immune response induced by VLPs in vitro and in vivo. The production of helper T cell (Th1) immune response cytokine (IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 immune response cytokine (IL-10) and inflammation cytokines (TNF-\u03b1) from virus-stimulated splenocytes in vitro were analyzed by ELISPOT quantitatively. Results showed that compared with PBS group, the inactivated DENV-1/2 antigen induced the secretion of 3 cytokines significantly in monovalent, bivalent DENV VLPs and inactivated virions group. It revealed that monovalent and bivalent VLPs had the ability to induce a potent immune response comparable with inactivated virions. The monovalent VLPs predominantly induced the Th-1 response in splenocytes both stimulated by inactivated DENV-1 and DENV-2 (Fig. 5) . Similar cytokines profiles were found in the blood of mice challenged by virus in vivo. Results showed that expressions of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 were elevated by VLPs compared with PBS group, suggesting that monovalent and bivalent VLPs could effectively induce cellular immune response. It has been reported that the levels of TNF-\uf061, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 are elevated in patients with dengue virus infection (40) . The serum levels of these cytokines is a potential predictor of disease severity (40) . Patients who died for DENV infection showed higher IL-10 levels in comparison with survivals. Besides, TNF-\uf061 is elevated in the later phase of illness, while IFN-\u03b3 was elevated in early phase of Dengue haemorrhagic fever (41) . In our results, the levels of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 in mice treated with monovalent, bivalent DENV VLPs were raised at day 1 after DENV-1/2 challenge and declined gradually at day 2-4 ( Fig.6) , which might indicate that DENV VLPs inhibited the development and progression of virus infection effectively.",

Monovalent VLPs sera prolonged the survival period of infected mice compared with PBS treated group. The highest protection rates (100%) observed in the sulking mice immunized with bivalent VLPs sera were possibly due to synergistic effect between DENV-1 VLPs and DENV-2 VLPs sera. Alternatively, the high concentration of cross-reactive antibodies forming macromolecules compouds by cross-linking numerous virions, may also prevent virus entering into cells. Although our data of protective experiment showed the significant protective effect of bivalent DENV VLPs against different types of dengue virus, it is well documented that DENV infection commonly lacks antibody cross-protection among serotypes (9).",
