However, many studies published to date included an insufficient number of patients to assess the absolute risk of uncommon adverse events (AEs), anticipated to occur in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. For CT-P13, uncommon AEs include infections, such as tuberculosis, and immune system disorders, such as serum sickness and anaphylactic reactions [5, 7]. For inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple studies enrolling over 100 patients investigated the safety of CT-P13 [12\u201324], likely reflecting the need for safety data in these indications, for which regulatory approval was based on extrapolation [25]. In contrast, few such studies have evaluated the safety profile of CT-P13 in patients with AS or RA [26\u201329], and data for PsA and Ps are lacking. To evaluate the safety profile of CT-P13 in the post-marketing setting, we present data pooled from six observational studies representing all authorised indications of CT-P13.",

CT-P13 infusions were performed as outpatient procedures in a clinic setting. Included studies were the CT-P13 4.2 Korea/EU registry for patients with RA (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02557295 [30]), the CT-P13 4.3 Korea/EU registry for patients with CD or UC (NCT02326155 [31]), the CT-P13 4.4 Korea/EU registry for patients with AS (NCT02557308 [32]), the KOREA-PMS study for all indications (not registered with ClinicalTrials.gov), the CONNECT-IBD study for patients with CD or UC (NCT02539368 [33]) and the PERSIST study for patients with RA, AS or PsA (NCT02605642 [34]). Full study details are provided in Table S1 in the electronic supplementary material (ESM). Briefly, the CT-P13 4.3 Korea/EU registry and KOREA-PMS study enrolled patients treated with CT-P13, regardless of prior biologic therapies. PERSIST enrolled patients treated with CT-P13, some of whom were switched from stable reference infliximab treatment at enrolment. CONNECT-IBD enrolled patients treated with CT-P13 or reference infliximab but permitted switching between CT-P13 and other anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents during the study. The CT-P13 4.4 Korea/EU registry and the CT-P13 4.2 Korea/EU registry enrolled patients receiving CT-P13 or anti-TNF agents. In Korea only, the CT-P13 4.2 study also enrolled a biologic-na\u00efve patient population. All patients included in this analysis received one or more CT-P13 dose prior to data cut-off (27 December 2017).",

In KOREA-PMS, data were collected for the 4-year post-marketing surveillance period according to Korean regulations. In CONNECT-IBD and PERSIST, the maximum follow-up duration was 2 years. All studies, apart from KOREA-PMS and data collection at Korean sites for the CT-P13 4.2 and CT-P13 4.4 registries, were ongoing at data cut-off. Data cut-off was defined based on achievement of the target sample size in order to meet the objectives of the analysis for the purpose of regulatory submission.",

In contrast, the incidence of TEAEs in our analysis was lower than the 84.36% of patients with CD who reported any AE [41] and the 77.53% of patients with UC who reported one or more pre-specified AE [42] in other registries, which may be due to their longer median follow-up times and longer durations of exposure to reference infliximab. Overall, the incidence of AESIs was consistent with the reference infliximab prescribing information [8]. In the case of intestinal or perianal abscess, for which incidence is not specified in the prescribing information, the incidence in our analysis (1.71% of patients with CD) was lower than that reported in a retrospective analysis of reference infliximab-treated patients with CD (n = 15/258; 5.81%) [43].",

In our analysis, 428 (9.74%) patients in the safety population reported infections including tuberculosis and 14 (0.32%) patients reported active tuberculosis (comprising 13 patients from Korea and one from Portugal). As expected, our subgroup analysis showed that the frequency of active tuberculosis was higher in countries that, per World Health Organization 2016 estimates, have a high incidence of tuberculosis than in countries with a low incidence (0.71 vs. 0.04%) [39]. The incidence of active tuberculosis in our analysis was consistent with data from observational studies. A large observational study of CT-P13 treatment in patients with IBD identified no cases of active tuberculosis among 353 patients after 54 weeks of follow-up [15], whereas tuberculosis was reported in 0.24% of patients (n = 6/2499) with CD who were treated with CT-P13 in a nationwide French study [18]. A post-marketing study of CT-P13 in the Republic of Korea reported one patient with active tuberculosis (of 113 [0.88%]) after 30 weeks of follow-up [17], whereas a Japanese post-marketing surveillance study with a 2-year follow-up period reported two patients (of 523; 0.38%) with tuberculosis [19].

            "text": "IRRs are another important safety concern related to CT-P13 treatment. In our analysis, 4.17% of patients reported IRRs. This is consistent with the incidence of IRRs reported in large observational studies of CT-P13 treatment in patients with IBD (2.56\u20139.37%) [12, 13, 15\u201317, 19, 23, 24], although definitions for IRRs are likely to vary between studies. The incidence of IRRs in our analysis was also similar to that of infusion or injection-site reactions in the Korean registry of patients with AS (n = 10/244; 4.10%) after up to 4 years of follow-up [26]. In addition, the incidence of IRRs in this analysis was lower than that described in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for reference infliximab of  \u2265 1/10 (very common) [8] when administered with concomitant immunosuppressant therapy as recommended. However, the case definition for IRR in this analysis differed from that used for reference infliximab in the SmPC: the observation interval post-administration was 1 day for CT-P13 versus 1 h in clinical studies for reference infliximab [8]. In the ADA-positive population in our analysis, 11.55% of patients experienced IRRs, suggesting a higher frequency of IRRs in ADA-positive patients. This would be consistent with findings for reference infliximab, as a two- to threefold increase in the frequency of IRRs is listed in the product information for ADA-positive patients [8]. However, the results of our analyses in the ADA-positive population should be interpreted with caution. The values may not be representative of the general population, as ADAs were not measured in all patients and were derived from studies where immunogenicity testing was optional, although the proportion of ADA-positive patients (30.17% of those with immunogenicity results) identified in our study was within the range reported in previous large observational studies of CT-P13 treatment [12, 15, 22, 24]. In addition, results of our analyses in the ADA-positive population are limited by the fact that patients in the ADA-positive population were also included in the safety population.",

As such, data were obtained from annual or interim reports for ongoing studies. It is important to note that CT-P13 exposure duration was independent of study duration to discontinuation in this analysis. CT-P13 exposure duration was determined for all patients, including those who had discontinued treatment, completed treatment or were continuing treatment. Study duration to discontinuation was calculated only for patients who had discontinued prior to data cut-off; patients who were continuing or had completed therapy were not included.

            "text": "This analysis included a large safety dataset collected systematically for 4393 patients who were administered CT-P13 under the conditions recommended in the authorised product information in observational studies. This sample size is sufficient to enable quantification of AEs occurring with a true frequency of approximately 1/1500 or greater. Thus, the frequency of uncommon AEs and a proportion of rare AEs can be estimated confidently using this dataset. However, any comparisons with published data for CT-P13 and reference infliximab should be made with caution because case definitions for AEs are likely to differ between studies, and other differences between study designs could also influence the comparability of the data. Patients with CD, UC, AS and RA were well represented in the safety population, although there were relatively few patients with PsA/Ps, meaning that further safety analyses might be warranted in this indication. Adult patients comprised most of the safety population (96.79%), so the incidences and IRs of AEs following CT-P13 treatment identified in our analysis should be representative of those expected in adult patients treated in the long term in clinical practice. As only 141 paediatric patients (3.21%) were included in the overall safety population, a separate analysis of paediatric data could not be conducted and should be a focus of future research. In addition, the findings of our analysis are limited by the open-label, observational design of the six contributing studies, as there were no concurrent controls. However, the inclusion of 716 patients who switched treatment from reference infliximab to CT-P13 provides valuable information on the safety profile for patients making this switch in treatments, although none of the contributing studies were designed to assess the interchangeability of CT-P13 and reference infliximab. As such, no conclusions can be drawn from the current analysis regarding the safety of unrestricted switching between reference infliximab and CT-P13, or switching involving any other infliximab biosimilars or TNF inhibitors, or regarding the interchangeability of reference infliximab and CT-P13.",

Comparisons must be made cautiously, but the safety profile of CT-P13 appears consistent with that of reference infliximab. Overall, these results support the favourable risk/benefit balance for CT-P13 when administered under the conditions of use recommended in the authorised product information.",
