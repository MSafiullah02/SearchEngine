            "text": "Cryo-EM structures exhibit loss of contrast at high-resolution coming from many different sources, including molecular motions, heterogeneity and/or signal damping by the transfer function of the electron microscope (CTF). Interpretation of high-resolution features in cryo-EM maps is essential to understanding the biological functions of macromolecules. Thus, approaches to compensate for this contrast loss and improve map visibility at high-resolution are crucial. This process is usually referred to as \"sharpening\" and is typically performed by imposing a uniform B-factor to the cryo-EM map that boosts the map signal amplitudes within a defined resolution range. When the map is sharpened with increasing positive B-factors the clarity and map details initially improve, but eventually the map becomes worse as the connectivity is lost, and the map densities appear broken and noisy. In the global sharpening approach (Rosenthal and Henderson 2003 , Fernandez, Luque et al. 2008 , Scheres 2015 , the B-factor is automatically computed by determining the line that best fits the decay of the spherically averaged noise-weighted amplitude structure factors, within a resolution range given by Rmax] , with Rmax the maximum resolution in the map given by the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC). More recently, the AutoSharpen method within Phenix ) calculates a single B-factor that maximizes both map connectivity and details of the resulting sharpened map. AutoSharpen automatically chooses the B-factor that leads to the highest level of detail in the map, while maintaining connectivity. This combination is optimized by maximizing the surface area of the contours in the sharpened map.",

            "text": "The approaches presented above are global, so the same signal amplitude scaling is applied to map regions that may exhibit very different signal to noise ratios (SNRs) at medium/highresolutions. Thus, cryo-EM maps showing inhomogeneous SNRs (and resolutions) can result into sharpened maps that show both over-sharpened and under-sharpened regions. The former may be strongly affected by noise and broken densities, while the latter may present reduced contrast at high-resolutions. Both cases make it difficult or even impossible to interpret the biological relevance of these regions or even the whole map (Murshudov 2016) . Thus, local sharpening methods have been proposed to overcome these limitations (Erney Ramirez-Aportela 2017, Jakobi, Wilmanns et al. 2017) . LocScale approach (Jakobi, Wilmanns et al. 2017 ) compares radial averages of structure factor amplitudes inside moving windows between the experimental and the atomic density maps. After, the method modifies locally the map amplitudes of the experimental map in Fourier space to rescale them accordingly to those of the atomic map. This approach requires as input a complete atomic model (without major gaps) fitted to the cryo-EM map to sharpen, which is not always available. In addition, the size of the moving window should be provided and depending on the quality of the map to be sharpened, this process may lead to overfitting. More recently, the LocalDeblur method (Erney Ramirez-Aportela 2017) proposed an approach for map local sharpening using as input an estimation of the local resolution. The method assumes that the map local density values have been obtained by the convolution between a local isotropic low-pass filter and the actual map. This local low-pass filter is assumed Gaussian shaped so that the frequency cutoff is given by the local resolution estimation.",

Bfactors can be further refined by model building packages, i.e. Phenix (Liebschner, Afonine et al. 2019) or Refmac (Winn, Murshudov et al. 2003) to improve the quality and accuracy of atomics models. Although B-factors are essential to 'sharpen' cryo-EM maps at high-resolution, they also provide key information to analyze cryo-EM reconstructions. Effective B-factors are used to model the combined effects of issues such as molecular drifting due to charging effects, macromolecular flexibility or possible errors in the reconstruction workflow that lead to a signal falloff (Rosenthal and Henderson 2003 , Liao and Frank 2010 , Penczek 2010 . However, cryo-EM maps are usually analyzed with a single B-factor, even though maps may largely differ in different regions. Thus, methods to determine local B-factors are much needed to accurately analyze cryo-EM maps and improve the quality of fitted atomic models. Another local parameter usually provided by X-ray crystallography in contrast with cryo-EM are atomic occupancies (or Q-values). The occupancy estimates the presence of an atom at its mean position and it ranges between 0.0 to 1.0. Note that these parameters can be also refined by model building packages if the electron density map is of sufficient resolution. To our knowledge, currently there is not any available method to estimate local occupancies from cryo-EM maps, even though this information (in addition to local Bfactors) is essential to building accurate atomic models. For example, in (Afonine, Klaholz et al. 2018 ) authors found that 31% of all models examined in this analysis possess unrealistic occupancies or/and B-factor values, such as all being set to zero or other unlikely values. They also reported that 40% of models analyzed show cross-correlations between cryo-EM maps and respective models below 0.5, and they indicated as a possible hypothesis an incomplete optimization of the model parameters (coordinates, occupancies and B-factors).",

More importantly, these approaches do not require input parameters as fitted atomic models or local resolution maps, which reduces the possibility of overfitting. In particular, our proposed local map enhancement approach (LocSpiral) is robust to maps affected by inhomogeneous local resolutions/SNRs, thus the method strongly improves the interpretability of these maps. Secondly, we also propose approaches to determine local B-factors and density occupancy maps to improve the analysis of cryo-EM reconstructions. The link between the different proposed approaches is the use of the spiral phase transform to estimate a modulation or amplitude map of the cryo-EM reconstruction at different resolutions.",

The average value of the local B-factor map to be used for sharpening is -299.11 \u00c5 2 (slope of the local Guinier plot multiplied by 4). We obtained the B-factor estimations within a resolution range between 15 \u00c5 to the FSC resolution given by 3.7 \u00c5. Interestingly, the B-factor map shows lower B-factors in the outer part of the macromolecule, corresponding to regions that are folded partially and show compositional and conformational heterogeneity. As we will see in more detail in the next section, these modestly sloped Guinier plots come from low amplitudes (close or below to the noise amplitude level) at resolutions of 15 \u00c5 or higher. This result can be directly observed in the obtained A map in the figure that shows low values in potentially unfolded regions. Therefore, in order to accurately analyze local B-factor maps, it is necessary to interpret both B and A maps.",

These points show parts of the map that correspond to clear spliceosome densities (green and red), flexible and low resolution spliceosomal regions (yellow and blue) and background (magenta). Figure 3B shows the corresponding Guinier plots of these points. Solid lines represent measured values of the logarithm of SNR-weighted structure factor amplitudes, while dashed lines show fitted curves. This figure also provides the obtained B-factors for the different curves. The Guinier plots and B-factors are determined within a resolution range of 15 \u00c5 to the FSC resolution, given by 4.28 \u00c5. As can be seen from Figure 3B , the red and green curves, which correspond to clear spliceosomal densities, present high amplitude values at 15 \u00c5, while yellow, blue and magenta curves show low amplitudes at 15 \u00c5 and a flat profile within the resolution range. In Figure 3B we also show in the black curve, the Guinier plot of the noise/background amplitudes obtained from the 95% quantile of the empirical noise/background distribution for reference. The discontinuous black line indicates the linear fit of this noise Guinier plot. Comparing the yellow, blue and magenta curves, it is clear that these plots are below our noise level and that the shape of these curves is similar to that of the noise curve. Figure 3D shows the spliceosome map coloured with the obtained B-factor map to be used for sharpening (slope of the local Guinier plot multiplied by 4). The average of these B-factors for sharpening is -153.68 \u00c5 2 , while the value reported by Relion postprocess is -158.08 \u00c5 2 . Figure 3E shows a central slice of the obtained B-factor map along Z axis. As can be seen from Figure 3E , the B-factor values in the background are low since the corresponding Guinier plots show a flat spectrum within the resolution range. In Figure 3F , that can be seen in Figure 3E . Thus, these regions show very low signal-to-noise rations and are just noise within this resolution range. Therefore, we have recalculated our B-factors using a new resolution range of [20, 10] \u00c5. The results are shown in Figure S2 . As can be seen from Figure S2 , now the flexible parts show low B-factor and amplitudes at 20 \u00c5 2 . In this case, the average value of the local B-factor map to be used for sharpening is of -639.15 \u00c5 2 (slope of the local Guinier plot multiplied by 4).",

In fact, our LocSpiral approach has been applied on several published publications (Ichikawa, Khalifa et al. 2019 , Yang, Chen et al. 2019 , Gutmann, Schafer et al. 2020 , Jahagirdar, Jha et al. 2020 , Khalifa, Ichikawa et al. 2020 , enabling molecular modelling on maps with flexibility and light anisotropic resolution.",

First, these maps can be employed to guide the manual tracing. These maps can be informative to estimate the range of structures that could be compatible to the given electron microscopy density. Second, for very high resolution cryo-EM maps, these values can be used as an approximation of the atomic B-factors and occupancies to be further refined as part of the automatic model refinement process by automatic model building packages as Phenix (Liebschner, Afonine et al. 2019) or Refmac (Winn, Murshudov et al. 2003) . B-factor maps provide complementary information to local resolution maps, though usually these results are correlated. The latter usually determines the resolution at a given point by comparing the map to noise or background amplitudes (Vilas, Gomez-Blanco et al. 2018) , while the former determines the rate of signal amplitude fall off within a resolution range. We can find map regions with similar local resolution (map amplitude similar to noise/background amplitude at this resolution and coordinates), while different B-factor as the signal damping could be different within the used resolution range (highly or slowly sloped).",

They do not require additional information as atomic models or local resolution maps. The common link between all these approaches is the use of the spiral phase transform, which is used to factorize cryo-EM maps into amplitude and phase terms in real space for different resolutions. The spiral phase transform has been extensively used in optics for phase extraction in interferometry (Larkin, Bone et al. 2001 , Antonio Quiroga and Servin 2003 , Vargas, Restrepo et al. 2011 , Vargas, Quiroga et al. 2012 or by Shack-Hartmann sensors (Vargas, Gonz\u00e1lez-Fernandez et al. 2010 , Vargas, Restrepo et al. 2012 ). This transformation is not new in cryo-EM as it has been proposed previously to facilitate particle screening (Vargas, Abrishami et al. 2013) , CTF estimation (Vargas, Oton et al. 2013 ) and local and directional resolution determination (Vilas, Gomez-Blanco et al. 2018 , Vilas, Tagare et al. 2020 . In (Vilas, Gomez-Blanco et al. 2018 , Vilas, Tagare et al. 2020 ) the authors used the Riesz transform to obtain amplitude maps, which is similar to the spiral phase transform.",

To calculate local occupancy maps, a typical resolution range between 50 and 10-8 \u00c5 is used to obtain density occupancies of complete secondary structure motifs, while ranges between 5 to 3-1.5 \u00c5 are used for high resolution cryo-EM maps to obtain occupancies of residues.",

This index can be extended to the analysis of any maturing macromolecule and is useful to place immature macromolecules into a maturing timeline. The calculation of this index requires reconstructions of immature and mature macromolecules. The mature reconstruction is used to obtain a binary solvent mask, while the immature reconstructions are used to calculate occupancy maps. These occupancy maps allow us to determine highly occupied regions (occupancy >0.75) and calculate occupancy masks. Then, the index is obtained comparing the number of voxels activated in the solvent mask of the mature reconstruction with the ones in the occupancy masks.",

The map densities are similar in the core of the protein, as can be seen from the red square in the figure where we show a zoomed view of the protein inner core or from the image with both maps superimposed. However, the map densities are quite different at the outer regions, where the Relion map shows thin and broken densities. In addition, we also show comparisons of fitted densities with the corresponding atomic model (PDB ID: 6t9n) of two \u03b1-helices and one loop. The asterisks label results obtained by LocSpiral. The residues marked with a red arrow were used to adjust the threshold values between maps. These comparisons show that the map obtained by LocSpiral shows fewer fragmented and broken densities and a better coverage of the atomic model, helping in the interpretation of the maps and in the process of building accurate atomic models.",

These results show that B-factors calculated from the EM map present modestly sloped Guinier plots in very flexible and blurred regions, which is not in agreement with the concept of B-factor as a measure of position uncertainty or disorder. The explanation for this discrepancy lays in the resolution range used to calculate the local B-factors from the electron microscopy map. Within the resolution range of [15, 4.28] \u00c5, the amplitudes of the highly flexible parts (helicase and SF3b domains) are very low and below the noise level, showing a flat spectrum",
