            "text": "Despite the nonlinear nature of turbulence, there is evidence that the energy-injection mechanisms sustaining wall turbulence can be ascribed to linear processes. The different scenarios stem from linear stability theory and comprise exponential instabilities from mean-flow inflection points, neutral modes, transient growth from non-normal operators, and parametric instabilities from temporal mean-flow variations, among others. These mechanisms, each potentially capable of leading to the observed turbulence structure, are rooted in simplified theories and conceptual arguments. Whether the flow follows any or a combination of them remains unclear. Here, we devise a collection of numerical experiments in which the Navier-Stokes equations are sensibly modified to quantify the role of the different linear mechanisms at low Reynolds number (Re \u03c4 \u2248 180). We achieve this by direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows, in which the energy transfer from the streamwise-averaged mean-flow (U ) to the fluctuating velocities (u ) is constrained to preclude a targeted linear mechanism. In contrast to other studies, our approach allows for direct evaluation of cause-and-effect links between the linear energy injection from U to u in a fully nonlinear setup. Our results show that turbulence persists when exponential instabilities and neutral modes of the mean flow are suppressed. Removing all exponential instabilities from the flow only leads to a 10% reduction of turbulent velocity fluctuations. We also show that the energy transfer from U to u via transient growth alone, without exponential and parametric instabilities, is sufficient for sustaining turbulence. Finally, we demonstrate that a collection of simulations with frozen-in-time U exclusively supported by transient growth provides a faithful representation of the actual time-varying energy transfer from U to u .",

Nevertheless, there is ample agreement that the energy-injection mechanisms sustaining wall-turbulence can be partially attributed to linear processes . The different mechanisms have their origins in linear stability theory (Reynolds & Hussain 1972; Hamilton et al. 1995; Waleffe 1997; Schoppa & Hussain 2002; Del\u00c1lamo & Jim\u00e9nez 2006; Hwang & Cossu 2010 and constitute the foundations of many control and modelling strategies (Kim & Zare et al. 2020) . Despite the ubiquity of linear theories, the significance of different instabilities in fully developed turbulence remains outstanding, and its relevance is consequential to comprehend, model, and control the structure of wall-bounded turbulence by linear methods (e.g. H\u00f6gberg et al. 2003; Del\u00c1lamo & Jim\u00e9nez 2006; Hwang & Cossu 2010; Zare et al. 2017; Morra et al. 2019; Towne et al. 2020) . Here we evaluate the various energy transfer mechanisms from the mean flow to the fluctuations in wall turbulence. We devise a collection of numerical experiments of turbulent flows over a flat wall, in which the Navier-Stokes equations are minimally altered to suppress the energy transfer from the mean flow to the fluctuating velocities via different linear mechanisms.",

            "text": "Several linear mechanisms have been proposed as plausible scenarios to rationalise the transfer of energy from the large-scale mean flow to the fluctuating velocities. Before diving into the intricacies of each mechanism, one may ask why we should insist on describing this energy transfer using linear theories if turbulence is undoubtedly a nonlinear phenomenon. One reason is that the energy source for turbulent fluctuations in shear flows is controlled by spatial differences across the mean velocity profile, which naturally reduces to a linear model (Brown & Roshko 1974; . It has been demonstrated in many occasions that the large scales of turbulent flows in strongly inhomogeneous environments do behave linearly at heart (Schmid 2007) . Wall turbulence with large-scale pressure or body forces imposed, e.g., in the streamwise direction is such an example. Also geophysical flows, in which rotation and stratification impose strong constraints on the flow. An additional motivation for the use of linear theories is a matter of practicality: our current framework to analyse linear systems is well beyond the tools to understand nonlinear equations. Hence, inasmuch the linear equations meaningfully represents the physics of the problem, linear tools greatly aid the analysis.",

            "text": "Clarified the convenience of linear theories, the next step is to select a reference base flow to linearise the flow about. It is generally agreed that the ubiquitous streamwise rolls (regions of rotating fluid) and streaks (regions of low and high streamwise velocity with respect to the mean) (Klebanoff et al. 1962; Kline et al. 1967 ) are involved in a quasiperiodic regeneration cycle (Panton 2001; Adrian 2007; Smits et al. 2011; Jim\u00e9nez 2012 Jim\u00e9nez , 2018 ) and that their space-time structure plays a crucial role in sustaining shear-driven turbulence (e.g. Kim et al. 1971; Jim\u00e9nez & Moin 1991; Butler & Farrell 1993; Hamilton et al. 1995; Waleffe 1997; Schoppa & Hussain 2002; Farrell & Ioannou 2012; Jim\u00e9nez 2012; Constantinou et al. 2014; Farrell et al. 2016; Lozano-Dur\u00e1n et al. 2018) . Accordingly, the flow is often decomposed into two components: a base flow defined through some averaging procedure over the instantaneous flow, and the threedimensional fluctuations (or perturbations) about that base flow. In this manner, the ultimate cause maintaining turbulence is conceptualised as the energy transfer from the base flow to the fluctuating flow, as sketched in figure 1.",

Various base flows have been proposed in the literature depending on the number of spatial directions and time interval to average the flow. For example, a common choice is to average the flow in all homogeneous directions and time (e.g., Reddy & Henningson 1993; Del\u00c1lamo & Jim\u00e9nez 2006; McKeon 2017) . Here, we take our base flow U to consist of the instantaneous streamwise-averaged velocity U (y, z, t) in the streamwise (x) direction with zero wall-normal (V = 0) and spanwise (W = 0) flow, where y and z are the wall-normal and spanwise directions respectively; see figure 1. Our choice is supported by previous studies (Waleffe 1997; Schoppa & Hussain 2002; Farrell & Ioannou 2012 ). Yet, there is no obvious a priori justification for selecting U (y, z, t) in favour of other alternatives base flows, and one of the goals here is to investigate whether U (y, z, t) is a meaningful choice to describe the energy transfer from the large scales to the fluctuating flow.",

According to the dynamical-systems perspective, the simplest description of turbulence is then given by a collection of fixed points and unstable periodic orbits embedded in a high-dimensional turbulent attractor (Kawahara et al. 2012 ). The first dynamicalsystem investigations of turbulence in shear flows began with nonlinear equilibrium states, referred to as 'exact coherent structures', of Couette flow (Nagata 1990 ). Since then, there have been multiple descriptions of these states in shear flow such as channels and pipes among others, often involving unstable travelling waves (e.g., Waleffe 2001; Kawahara & Kida 2001; Wedin & Kerswell 2004; Gibson et al. 2009; van Veen & Kawahara 2011; Kreilos & Eckhardt 2012; Park & Graham 2015; Hwang et al. 2016; Sekimoto & Jim\u00e9nez 2017) . Kawahara & Kida (2001) discovered time-periodic orbits for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on plane Couette flow that exhibit a full regeneration cycle comprising the formation and breakdown of streamwise vortices and low-velocity streaks. Hall & Smith (1988 proposed a theoretical nonlinear framework to describe selfsustaining process and transition in terms of vortex-wave interactions (VWI). In the VWI theory, a single downstream propagating wave interacts with itself to produce a spanwise periodic stress jump which drives a roll. The roll then interacts with a neutrally stable mean streamwise flow to produce a streak. Subsequent developments of the VWI theory include extensions to laminar to turbulent transition (Wang et al. 2007 ) and multiscale motions consistent with the logarithmic layer (Hall 2018) . Other descriptions of selfsustaining turbulence include the study by Deguchi & Hall (2015) , and the semi-analytical model by Chini et al. (2017) ; the latter devoted to the formation and maintenance of uniform momentum zones and interlaced vortical fissures. While all these theories could provide a plausible explanation for how turbulence self-sustains, we are still lacking direct evidence regarding whether one or a combination of the above-mentioned mechanisms actually at work in realistic turbulent flows.",

Inasmuch as the instantaneous realisations of the streaky flow are strongly inflectional, the flow U (y, z, t) is invariably unstable at a frozen instant of time . These inflectional instabilities are markedly robust and, therefore, their excitation has been proposed to be the mechanism that replenishes the perturbation energy of the turbulent flow (Hamilton et al. 1995; Waleffe 1997; Andersson et al. 2001; Kawahara et al. 2003; Hack & Zaki 2014; Hack & Moin 2018) . Consequently, the exponential instability of the streak is thought to be central to the maintenance of wall turbulence. The modal character of the base flow is also central in the vortex-wave interaction theory in which it is postulated that the regeneration cycle is supported by the interaction of a roll with the neutrally stable mean streamwise-flow (Hall & Smith 1988 Hall 2018) .",

In this case, the base flow, while being exponentially stable, supports the growth of perturbations for a period of time due to the non-normality of the linear operator about that very base flow; a process referred to as non-modal transient growth (e.g. Trefethen et al. 1993; Butler & Farrell 1993; Farrell & Ioannou 1996a; Del\u00c1lamo & Jim\u00e9nez 2006; Schmid 2007; Cossu et al. 2009 ). Other studies suggest that the generation of streaks is due to the structure-forming properties of the linearised Navier-Stokes operator, independent of any organised vortices (Chernyshenko & Baig 2005) , but the non-modal transient growth is still invoked. The transient growth scenario gained even more popularity since the work by Schoppa & Hussain (2002) (see also de Giovanetti et al. 2017) , who argued that transient growth may be the most relevant mechanism not only for streak formation but also for their eventual breakdown. Schoppa & Hussain (2002) showed that most streaks detected in actual wall-turbulence simulations are indeed exponentially stable for the set of wavenumbers considered. Hence, the loss of stability of the streaks would be better explained by the transient growth of perturbations, that would lead to vorticity sheet formation and nonlinear saturation.",

They adopted the perspective of statistical state dynamics (SSD) to develop a tractable theory for the maintenance of wall turbulence. Within the SSD framework, the perturbations are maintained by an essentially time-dependent, parametric instability of the base flow. The concept of \"parametric instability\" refers here to perturbation growth that is inherently caused by the time-dependence of U . The self-sustaining mechanism proposed by SSD still relies on the highly non-normal streamwise roll and streak structure. However, it differs from other mechanisms above in that it requires the time-variations of U for the growth of perturbations to be supported. Furthermore, it implies that mechanisms based on critical layers and modal growth processes (Hall & Smith 1988; Waleffe 1997; Hall & Smith 1991; McKeon & Sharma 2010) are not responsible for the energy transfer from U to u , since those mechanisms ignore the intrinsic time-dependence of the base flow.",

It remains to establish whether self-sustaining turbulence follows predominantly one of the abovementioned mechanisms, or a combination of them. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of different linear mechanisms via direct numerical simulation of channel flows with constrained energy extraction from the streamwise-averaged mean-flow. To that end, we modify the Navier-Stokes equations to suppress targeted linear mechanisms, while maintaining a fully nonlinear system. This approach falls within the category of \"instantiated\" causality, i.e., intrusively perturbing a system (cause) and observing the consequences (effect) (Pearl 2009 ). In our case, the altering of the system has the benefit of providing a clear cause-and-effect assessment of the importance of each linear mechanism implicated in sustaining the flow. Preliminary versions of this work can be found in Lozano-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2018) and Lozano-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2020) . The present work also provides a complementary viewpoint to the study of self-sustaining wall turbulence by , who introduced a non-intrusive probabilistic measure of causality based on the Shannon entropy.",

Equation (5.2) is akin to the Navier-Stokes equations, in which the equation of motion of U is replaced by U = (U 0 , 0, 0). We refer to this case as \"channel flow with no-feedback\" or NF180 for short. Note that the base flow U 0 has no explicit feedback from u in (5.2), although it has been implicitly 'shaped' by the velocity fluctuations of R180 and, as such, it contains dynamic information of actual wall turbulence. Hence, the term L(U 0 )u in (5.2) is strictly linear. Also note that L(U 0 ) preserves the modal and non-modal properties of L(U ) in R180. The flow sustained in NF180 is turbulent as seen in the history of the turbulent kinetic energy in figure 11 . Moreover, the footprint of the flow trajectory projected onto the P xyz -D xyz plane also exhibits a similar behaviour to R180 (figure 4b): the flow is organised around P xyz = D xyz with excursions into the high/low dissipation and production regions with predominantly counter-clockwise motions. The mean turbulence intensities for NF180 are shown in figure 12 . Statistics are collected once the system reaches the statistically steady state. The mean velocity profile is omitted as it is identical to that of R180 in figure 6(a). For comparison, figure 12 includes one-point statistics for R180 (previously shown in figure 6(b) ). The main consequence of precluding the non-linear feedback from u to U is an increase of the level of the turbulence intensities, i.e., the feedback mechanism counteracts the growth of fluctuating velocities in R180. Despite these differences, we can still argue that the turbulence intensities in NF180 are alike those in R180 by noting that the friction velocity u \u03c4 is not now the appropriate scaling velocity for NF180. The traditional argument for u \u03c4 as the relevant velocity-scale of energy-containing eddies is that the turbulence intensities equilibrate to comply with the mean integrated momentum balance, Then, a characteristic velocity-scale can be constructed as",

The results are consistent with the trends reported in figure 15 for NF-SEI180 and NF180 simulations: turbulence without modal instabilities sustains despite allowing the feedback from u to U . As in NF-SEI180, the resulting velocity fluctuations are diminished by roughly 10%. Figure 18 portrays snapshots of the streamwise velocity at three different instants for the R-SEI180 simulation. As in R180 (cf. figure 5) , the spatial organisation of the streak cycles through different stages of elongated straight motion, meandering and breakdown, although the first two states (panels (a) and (b)) occur more frequently than in R180. Indeed, if we consider the common definition for the streamwise velocity fluctuation u = u \u2212 u xzt , which contains part of the streak flow, the new flow in R-SEI180 attains an augmented streak intensity as clearly depicted in figure 17 (b). The outcome is consistent with the occasional inhibition of the streak meandering or breakdown via exponential instability, which enhances u , whereas wallnormal (v = v ) and spanwise (w = v ) turbulence intensities are diminished due to a lack of vortices succeeding the collapse of the streak. This behaviour is also observed in many drag reduction investigations (Jung et al. 1992; Laadhari et al. 1994; Choi & Clayton 2001; Ricco & Quadrio 2008) . As a final comment, it is worth mentioning that in a preliminary work Lozano-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2018) showed that turbulence was not sustained when L(U ) was stabilised by L(U )\u2212\u00b5I, where \u00b5 > 0 is a damping parameter and I is the identity operator. However, it can be shown that introducing the linear drag \u2212\u00b5u reduces the transient gains supported by L(U ) by a factor of exp(\u22122\u00b5T ). Hence, stabilising L(U ) via a linear drag term \u2212\u00b5u disrupts the transient growth mechanism severely and this was the cause for the lack of sustained turbulence in Lozano-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2018).",

We performed more than 500 simulations using different frozen base flows U (y, z, t i ) extracted from R180.

In the cases for which turbulence persists, the projection of the flow trajectory onto the P xyz -D xyz is reminiscent of the self-sustaining cycle for R180; an example is shown in figure 19 (b). SinceL {i} is modally stable, a key ingredient to sustain turbulence in NF-TG180 i is the scattering and generation of new disturbances by N (u {i} ).

This energy transfer is the backbone of the self-sustaining cycle in wall turbulence and a subject of heated debates. The mechanism by which this transfer occurs has long been hypothesised to be correctly captured by the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. Various linear theories stand as tenable candidates to rationalise this process, among them, exponential instabilities of the base flow, neutral modes, non-modal transient growth, and non-modal transient growth supported by parametric instability. To date, a conclusive study regarding the role play by each linear mechanisms has remained elusive due to the lack of clear causal inference provided by traditional non-intrusive tools.",

Altering the equations of motion in this manner has the advantage of providing a direct cause-and-effect assessment of the role played by different linear mechanisms in sustaining turbulence. We devised two numerical experiments tailored for minimal turbulent channel units. In the first experiment, the linear operator is modified to render any exponential instabilities of the streaks stable, thus precluding the energy transfer from the mean to the fluctuations via exponential growth. In the second experiment, we simulated turbulent channel flows with prescribed, frozen-in-time, exponentially stable base flows, such that both parametric instabilities as well as exponential instabilities are suppressed.",

While in real flow modal instabilities exist, they are only responsible for only around 10% of the turbulent fluctuating velocities. We have also shown that, for a given frozen-in-time base flow, transient growth alone is capable of sustaining turbulence in the absence of any exponential and parametric instabilities. The resulting turbulence depends of course on the particular base flow selected but, interestingly enough, the ensemble average of multiple cases with different frozen-in-time base-flows reproduces the statistics of realistic turbulences, i.e., those with a time-varying base flow. This last result suggests that the ensemble average of simulations only sustained by transient growth provides a reasonable representation of the actual time-varying energy transfer from U to u .",

We repeat the simulations in \u00a76.2 using the same set-up. As an example, the evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy for ten cases is shown in figure 24 (a). Given thatL(U ) is modally stable, the turbulent kinetic energy decays without exception. We verified that this was the case for all the simulations considered in \u00a7 6.2 once N (u ) is set to zero. Conversely, if we consider the systemin which modal instabilities are allowed, the turbulent kinetic energy grows exponentially as seen in figure 24 (b) given that the ten cases considered are all such that L(U ) is modally unstable. It was also verified that the growth rate obtained by integrating (A 2) coincides with the growth rate \u03bb 1 of the most unstable mode as predicted by the eigenvalue analysis of L(U ). The present appendix serves as validation of the successful suppression of modal instabilities in L(U ), and complements the results in figure 13 and the analysis in Appendix B.",
