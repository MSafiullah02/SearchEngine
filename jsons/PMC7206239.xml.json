However, it is hard to control a totally unsupervised model to only show the concerned aspects. Supervised sequential learning methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) [12] and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [11, 29] are applied to extract aspects, as the task can be formulated as a sequence labeling problem. Currently, some supervised deep learning models [17, 25, 31, 32] can achieve better performances than previous works by introducing additional supervision from lexicons and other hand-crafted features. However, we insist that the automated feature learning is always preferred. Moreover, because the manual annotation of training data is usually very costly, especially for domain dependent aspects (i.e., different domains may have different aspect spaces), researchers are motivated to develop more effective semi-supervised learning models for aspect mining.",

The latter approach outperforms the former as it benefits from both labeled and unlabeled reviews. However, the existing model [33] is trained in two separated phases: pre-train on unlabeled review in corresponding domains; and then perform supervised learning on labeled reviews. The representations (or embeddings) learned in the pre-training phase do not take advantages of labeled reviews, i.e., they only learn domain specific but task free representations. Our consideration is whether we can learn task and domain specific representations from both labeled and unlabeled reviews at the same time and perform aspect mining in an end-to-end architecture.",

            "text": "In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised End-to-end MOVing-window Attentive framework (called EMOVA) to enhance aspect mining on customer reviews. Instead of separately pre-training and supervised learning, EMOVA alternately learns a model on a mini-batch of labeled reviews and unlabeled reviews from the same domain based on Cross-View Training (CVT) [5]. Specifically, EMOVA derives the representations of reviews based on two neural layers with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) [8] by considering two important observations in reviews: (1) Customer reviews often contain misspelling words; (2) Multiple aspects may coordinately appear in one sentence. To this end, EMOVA derives char-features from words as extra embeddings, because general pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe [21]) may not cover all misspelling words. Moreover, the past nearby words provide useful semantic clues for finding new aspects. For instance, under the coordinate structure, the previous aspect (e.g., \u201coperating system\u201d) should be more significant than other words to guide the extraction of subsequent aspects (e.g., \u201cpreloaded software\u201d). To capture these context significances, EMOVA employs an attention mechanism to encode the information within a moving-window.",

For instance, some methods manually choose domain specified seed words [15, 20] or must and cannot sets [3] for topic modeling. By introducing lifelong topic modeling [2], researchers propose a continually modeling system that can automatically mine knowledge from previous results to supervise the following tasks. However, this kind of methods often need manually defined domain knowledge and do not fully use existing labeled reviews. Another direction of semi-supervised learning is to take the advantage of unlabeled reviews in the same domain to improve the supervised model. The idea of pre-training has been applied in the aspect mining model [33] to learn domain specific word embeddings from unlabeled reviews in advance; these word embeddings have better representations than the general word embeddings and are fed into normal supervised models. However, these pre-trained domain specific representations are still not specific enough for the aspect mining task. Nevertheless, our EMOVA framework can learn both task and domain specific representations of reviews in an unified framework, which then enhance the aspect mining.",

The idea of CVT is as follows: (1) A primary prediction module is trained with the standard supervised learning on labeled examples; (2) On unlabeled examples, a number of auxiliary prediction modules with different views on the input data are trained to agree with the primary prediction module; (3) By alternatively training on labeled data and unlabeled data, both representation learning and prediction modules get improved.

In the pre-training step of these two-phase models (e.g., DE-CNN and BERT), they do not take advantage of labeled reviews. More specifically, BERT learns better representations by training a deep language model on large amounts of texts, and DE-CNN attempts to learn domain-specific but general-purpose representations rather than both domain and task specific representations in our EMOVA. As a result, EMOVA works better than the two-phase (i.e., pre-training and supervised learning) models.\n",

The Cross-View Training (CVT) is employed to train auxiliary prediction modules on unlabeled reviews to improve the representation learning in a unified end-to-end architecture. Further, EMOVA exploits the moving-window attention mechanism to capture significant past nearby semantic contexts. Experimental results over four datasets from SemEval workshops show that EMOVA outperforms the state-of-the-art models, even on small labeled training datasets.",
