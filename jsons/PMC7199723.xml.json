In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, the disease-associated to the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, a pandemic. A significant amount of COVID-19 patients is currently experiencing severe interstitial pneumonia possibly ending up with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This severe form of COVID-19 shares several clinical and laboratory features with the four entities mentioned above and currently included in the definition of \u201chyperferritinemic syndromes\u201d [2]. This concept may guide and support therapeutic choices as all these entities respond to a similar approach consisting of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents such as glucocorticoids, IVIg, cyclosporin, IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition [1,2]. Plasmapheresis or IL-18 blockade may be considered as well [1,3]. Some preliminary results confirm the beneficial effects of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 [4] and current recommendations [5] advocate its use in those patients evolving toward the most severe stage of illness characterized by an extra-pulmonary systemic hyper-inflammation [6].",

            "text": "Hyperferritinemia is the hallmark of the \u201chyperferritinemic syndromes\u201d and along the last decade, increasing evidence supports the idea that high circulating ferritin may not only reflect an acute phase response but also play a critical role in inflammation [12]. Ferritin is a major intracellular iron storage protein and the ratio between its two subunits, H and L, may differ depending on tissue type and physiologic status of the cell [13]. H-ferritin seems to display not only an immunomodulatory function [14,15] but also a pro-inflammatory activity culminating with the induction of the expression of different inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2 [16]. Hyperferritinaemia characterizes several autoimmune diseases [17] where it may play a pathogenetic role on the ground of its immunomodulatory properties [12]. The origin of circulating serum ferritin during inflammatory conditions is still debated. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ferritin might be actively secreted by hepatocytes [18] as well as by macrophages through a non-classical pathway [19]. Thus, it is likely that in \u201chyperferritinemic syndromes\u201d macrophage activation could actively contribute to ferritin production. In line with this hypothesis, in a previous study, we demonstrated that in AOSD ferritin serum levels are not only correlated with disease activity, but also with macrophage activation [20]. Interestingly, in a very recent study describing a cohort of 39 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, ferritin serum levels were found significantly correlated with disease severity [21]. Besides an active secretion, during the inflammatory reaction, a major component of serum ferritin derives by cellular death, in particular by hepatic cells death. Once released, ferritin loses part of the inner iron content giving rise to extremely high serum levels of \u201cfree iron\u201d [22]. It seems that the excess of circulating \u201cfree iron\u201d detectable during severe inflammatory conditions, can deteriorate the inflammatory reaction with the particular ability to induce a marked pro-coagulant state [22]. This capacity is related to changes in the morphology of red blood cells and fibrin induced by \u201cfree iron\u201d able itself to favor the production of hydroxyl radical [22]. Oxidative stress on red blood cells and fibrin can induce the production of dense clots responsible for stroke development [23]. Due to the capacity of iron chelation to taper the inflammatory response through a reduction of ROS production and to promote an anti-viral activity, the utility of this therapeutic approach in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been recently addressed [24]. A clinical trial on the use of Desferal (Deferoxamine, a medication able to bind iron in case of \u201ciron overdose\u201d) is currently ongoing in IRAN in patients with mild to severe COVID-19 infection (NCT04333550).",

            "text": "Coagulopathy is one of the main complications occurring in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Despite prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, the occurrence of cardiovascular stroke is extremely high, in some cases in the form of a diffused intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). In a Chinese cohort from Wuhan, DIC occurred in about 6.4% of patients who died (n = 109) for severe COVID [25]. Acro-ischemia is one of the most frequent presentations of this complication being associated with a significant rate of death [26]. DIC is a known major complication also of the other hyperferritinemic syndromes including AOSD [27], MAS [28], sepsis [29] and, of course, CAPS. Inflammation induces increased coagulation by two different effects: by activating the cascade coagulation system and by downregulating the anti-coagulant mechanisms [29]. The endothelial cell and platelet activation occurring in CAPS is a key contributor to the genesis of a \u201cthrombotic storm\u201d [30] and in this setting, it is remarkable the role of infections as triggers of the disease [31]. It is of note that three Chinese COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU and presenting thrombotic events tested positive for anticardiolipin IgA antibodies as well as anti\u2013\u03b22 glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies [32].",

The severity of its evolution does not seem exclusively ascribable to viral factors, but probably to host features including different epidemiologic and molecular factors (Fig. 1\n). Among them, the presence of an age and sex preference is evident with a higher occurrence of severe inflammation especially in elderlies and men [40]. The different lung expression of the ACE2 molecule, the receptor used by COVID-19 to enter cells, could be one of the reasons responsible for a higher prevalence of the severe disease in this specific subset of patients [41]. Accordingly, specific therapies modulating the expression of this receptor such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers could be considered an additional external factor providing a major risk for patients. Co-morbidities represent another risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19 systemic inflammation and among them, type II Diabetes is one of the mostly described. To this regard, the increased expression of another receptor named human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), highly expressed in patients with type II diabetes, might be implicated in the worst disease outcome do to the possible ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells through DPP4 binding, as already described in MERS-CoV infection [42].",

Due to similarities with this condition, a genetic predisposition cannot be excluded as well. In AOSD, the presence of rare coding variants in IL-1 related pathways [46] and gene polymorphism associated with IL-18 [49] have been identified.

            "text": "Besides genetic factors, the modulation of the expression of different cytokines both by lung epithelial cells and by innate and adaptive immune cells needs to be taken into account. Regarding IL-1\u03b2, it is important to remind that previous studies on SARS-CoV demonstrated the ability of the virus to up-regulate inflammasome activity with consequent capacity to actively increase the production of IL-1\u03b2 [51]. Due to the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (82% nucleotide sequence homology), it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 displays the same capacity to induce an exaggerated IL-1\u03b2 mediated response. Thus, the link between COVID-19 induced inflammatory reaction and hyperferritinemic syndromes, such as AOSD or MAS, is immediately evident being both related to a massive IL-1\u03b2 systemic release. During MAS, it is also important to remind the role of type II interferon (IFN), which is a crucial mediator of the inflammatory response and whose neutralization looks promising in this condition [52]. In this regard, although it is known that type I IFN represents the main anti-viral pathway, studies on SARS-CoV revealed that both type I and type II IFN (alpha-beta and gamma) synergize to inhibit virus replication with a concomitant active virus attempt to reduce such IFN production [53]. Preliminary data from COVID-19 patients suggest how a suppressed IFN\u03b3 production by CD4+ T cells is associated with more severe disease [54]. Nonetheless, in the advanced stages of the disease, an over-expression of this molecule may occur, due to a second \u201cwave\u201d of systemic inflammatory reaction similar to MAS. For this reason, a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of concomitant inhibition of IL-1 (Anakinra) and IFN\u03b3 (emapalumab) in severe COVID-19 patients has just started (NCT04324021). However, in patients with COVID-19, a clear distinction between ARDS and MAS is challenging, especially in the first phases of the disease where ARDS represents the main source of IL-6 and L-1 [33]. Results from Anakinra/Emapalumab trial will surely provide interesting insights on this COVID-19 associated \u201cMAS like-syndrome\u201d.",

However, IL-6 is also a crucial regulator of the balance among fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial lung cells and is able to participate in the resolution of inflammation [57]. Thus, a prolonged therapeutic blockade of this cytokine and the exact timing to do that needs to be carefully considered [33].",

            "text": "Finally, regarding other epidemiological factors possibly able to influence disease outcome, the use of concomitant immune modulating/immune-suppressive therapies is certainly critical [58]. Interestingly, preliminary observations point out that immunosuppressed heart- transplanted patients present a milder form of COVID-19 during the later stages when the clinical evolution is mediated by the host inflammatory response [59,60]. At the moment, the Italian Society of Rheumatology has organized a national registry to gather information regarding patients with immune-rheumatologic disease infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has proposed a similar registry too. Very preliminary results on a large cohort of Italian patients with chronic arthritis treated with immunosuppressive agents (biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs), showed no increased risk of respiratory or life-threatening complication from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the limited follow-up and the small number of cases that do not allow to draw any conclusion, the results could suggest a possible benefit of immune suppression in these patients, possibly preventing the onset of uncontrolled systemic inflammation [61]. Collection and further analysis of such information will be of great interest for the future.",

A common pathogenic background is probably underlying to these conditions suggesting the use of therapies that target crucial inflammatory mediators. To date, several clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of IL-6 inhibition by Tocilizumab (NCT04317092, NCT04320615, NCT04315480, NCT04332913, NCT0433175, NCT04330638, NCT04332094) or Sarilumab (NCT04315298, NCT04327388, NCT04324073, NCT04322773), and IL-1 inhibition by Anakinra, (NCT04324021) are ongoing. Response to these therapies, known to display a significant benefit especially in AOSD [62,63] and MAS [64], will further support the hypothesis of a strict pathogenic connection between \u201chyperferritinemic syndrome\u201d and severe COVID-19.",
