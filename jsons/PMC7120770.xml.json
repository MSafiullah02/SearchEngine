            "text": "Proteolysis represents one of the key processes underlying biological events from fertilization through embryonic development, cell differentiation, ageing and ultimately death via the programmed route (apoptosis) or necrosis in the case of trauma, infection or disease. The term \u201cpeptidase\u201d (or protease) is used to refer to the complement of enzymes that cleave peptide bonds and, as such, all known proteins and peptides represent their potential substrate repertoires. According to the location of the peptide bond cleaved by the peptidases, they are conventionally sub-divided into \u201cendopeptidases\u201d that cleave the bond within the polypeptide chain, or exopeptidases that release amino acids from the N- or C-terminus of the substrate. However, this is an over-simplification since some peptidases, e.g. ACE, can fulfill both endo- and exopeptidase functions (Skidgel and Erd\u00f6s 1985). The term \u201climited proteolysis\u201d was originally introduced by Linderstrom-Lang to distinguish the restricted specificity of certain peptidases, particularly those involved in post-translational modification of proprotein precursors, from the random proteolysis accompanying protein degradation (Neurath 1999).",

            "text": "The number of species in which peptidases have now been identified is approaching 5,000 (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/) distributed among five classes (metallo-, serine, cysteine, aspartic and threonine) with cysteine-, serine- and metallopeptidases representing the major ones. Among these three main classes, the known or putative metallopeptidases are more consistently represented across species varying from 105, for example, in Trypanosoma cruzi to 164 in mouse (and 161 in the human) (Table 19.1). The other two classes exhibit a greater diversity ranging in the number of genes for cysteine proteases from 26 in T. cruzi to 162 in mouse (and 160 in the human). For the serine peptidases this distribution is even more pronounced: from 14 in T. cruzi to 245 in mouse (210 in human). There are a smaller number of aspartic peptidases although some are of key therapeutic importance (e.g. the \u03b2- and \u03b1-secretases implicated in Alzheimer pathology) and even less variety in the number of threonine peptidases. This greater consistency of representation of metallopeptidases across species probably reflects more generic cellular functions and their distinctive catalytic mechanisms which require a water molecule activated by a divalent metal ion, commonly zinc.\n",

            "text": "The complete repertoire of peptidases expressed by a tissue or organism is now referred to as the \u201cprotein degradome,\u201d a concept originally introduced by Lopez-Otin and colleagues (Cal et al. 2003). Comparative analysis of mammalian degradomes has revealed that rodents generally have a more complex combination of peptidases compared with primates, mainly due to the expansion of peptidase families involved in reproduction and host defence (Puente et al. 2005). These authors also found several genes implicated in reproduction, nutrition and the immune system, which are functional in rat, mouse or chimpanzee, but have been inactivated by mutations in the human lineage. These findings suggested that conversion of specific peptidase genes into pseudogenes has contributed to the evolution of the human genome. A recent example of this \u201cpseudogenisation\u201d is found in the ACE3 gene in the human (Rella et al. 2007). Approx one-quarter of the 80 or so human inherited diseases caused by mutations in protease-coding genes (http://www.uniovi.es/degradome/) are linked to metallopeptidases (see Table 19.2). Abnormal functioning of these genes is implicated in such diverse pathologies as inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Understanding the normal roles of these enzymes and their homologues is important for the design of novel and selective therapeutics. Animal venoms are a natural source of a wide range of metallopeptidases which have biological implications (Moura-da-Silva et al. 2007) and some bacterial toxins (e.g. botulinum, tetanus) exert their toxic actions as metalloproteases, in their case by blocking neurotransmitter release by proteolysis of synaptobrevin (Schiavo et al. 1992).\n",

Highly specific proteolysis can regulate G protein receptor signalling (proteinase-activated receptors) (Bunnett 2006), and nuclear transcriptional events through regulated intramembrane proteolysis (Wolfe 2009).

            "text": "The process of protein biosynthesis itself involves proteolytic processing: the removal of initiator methionine, signal peptide, cell localization signal and propeptide, where present. A primary mechanism in post-translational modifications of proteins is hence the co-translational removal of the N-terminal methionine from a nascent protein, a process which ultimately determines the half-life of a protein by exposing a new N-terminal residue, as originally proposed by Varshavsky and colleagues (the N-end rule) (Bachmair et al. 1986). Proteins retaining the initiator methionine have shorter half-lives (Frottin et al. 2006). This has led to the definition of specific protein degradation signals or \u201cdegrons\u201d that can allow rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes and the ClpAP protease in bacteria (Ravid and Hochstrasser 2008; Mogk et al. 2007). The initiating step, the methionine removal, is catalysed by methionyl aminopeptidases (MetAP) and, although the eukaryotic MetAP was originally thought to be cobalt-dependent, it is likely that the physiologically relevant cation for this enzyme is zinc (Bradshaw et al. 2004; Leopoldini et al. 2007). Methionine removal subsequently followed by modification of the N-terminal residue is often crucial for the function, or dysfunction, of a protein. In this context, the post-translational conversion of an N-terminal glutamate to a cyclized form (pyroglutamyl) is relatively common and is catalysed by the zinc metalloenzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) (Huang et al. 2005). This can modify, among other substrates, the Alzheimer\u2019s amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide rendering it more hydrophobic with a greater propensity to aggregation (Cynis et al. 2008). Small molecule inhibitors of QC may provide novel therapeutics in the treatment of AD (Schilling et al. 2008) and see below (Sect. 19.7).",

In this chapter we shall focus on zinc metallopeptidase families belonging to one of these clans, namely MA, since these are principally involved in the cell-surface or extracellular post-translational modifications of proteins and peptides. Representatives of this clan require zinc for their activity and are often referred to as \u201czincins.\u201d They contain histidine residues as zinc ligands in the typical zinc binding motif, His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His (HEXXH). They are further sub-divided according to the nature of the third zinc ligand: gluzincins use a glutamyl residue which lies 18\u201372 amino acids C-terminal to the HEXXH motif; metzincins use a His or Asp within an extended zinc motif HEXXHXXGXXH/D. They are termed metzincins because of a strictly conserved methionine-containing turn (the Met-turn) in their structure which is thought to provide a hydrophobic base at the zinc-binding site (St\u00f6cker et al. 1995).",

The first example of these to be discovered was the cytosolic enzyme, leucyl aminopeptidase (Burley et al. 1990). A key function for this enzyme is in \u201ctrimming\u201d proteasome-produced peptides for class I antigen presentation and it is up-regulated by cytokines, e.g. \u03b3-interferon (Beninga et al. 1998). Another example of key pathophysiological significance is the type II membrane glycoprotein, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII; NAALADase), which has two distinct roles: in the brain it inactivates the neuropeptide N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate by cleaving off the \u03b1-linked glutamate whereas in the intestine it sequentially releases \u03b3-linked glutamates from folyl-poly-\u03b3-glutamates (folate hydrolase activity). It is also identical with the prostate cancer marker PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen), which is highly expressed in aggressive prostate tumours and which might provide a target for immunological or other therapeutic approaches to the disease (Els\u00e4sser-Beile et al. 2009). The recent structural solution of a catalytically inactive mutant (E424A) of GCPII in complex with its substrate (N-Ac-Asp-Glu) has, for the first time, revealed the detailed reaction mechanism for this dual zinc-containing metallopeptidase (Klus\u00e1k et al. 2009).",

Arguably, ACE is better termed peptidyl-dipeptidase-A because, as a carboxydipeptidase, it has a number of important substrates and functions in addition to the processing of angiotensin, but it is generally referred to as \u201cACE.\u201d Relatively recently in the timescale of vertebrate evolution the ACE gene underwent an internal duplication producing the so-called somatic form of the enzyme which has two catalytic sites (the N- and C-domains) which, while similar, show some differences both in substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity. X-ray crystal structures for each of these domains in complex with selective inhibitors have revealed the molecular basis for this selectivity in the two peptide processing domains (Watermeyer et al. 2008). Use of an alternative initiation site produces a form of ACE with only a single catalytic site expressed exclusively in mammalian testis which is critical to male reproduction (Hagaman et al. 1998).",

            "text": "Vertebrates are now known to express the homologous peptidase ACE2 (Tipnis et al. 2000) whose actions seem to counterbalance those of ACE. ACE is, of course, of great importance in the regulation of blood pressure through its conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I into the vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin II by removal of the C-terminal dipeptide. Potent inhibitors of ACE, such as captopril or lisinopril, are hence highly effective anti-hypertensive agents (Menard and Patchett 2001) and do not inhibit ACE2 (Tipnis et al. 2000). Figure 19.1 illustrates the similarities between ACE and ACE2 and their counter-regulatory roles in angiotensin metabolism and hence cardiovascular biology. Most notably, ACE2 comprises only a single catalytic metalloprotease extracellular domain and its transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain share no similarity with ACE but with a small membrane protein, collectrin, involved in amino acid transport in the kidney (Danilczyk et al. 2006). ACE2 appears to be a dual function protein since it also is involved in amino acid transport through interactions with its collectrin-like domains but functions as a protease (a strict carboxypeptidase) through its extracellular ACE-like domain (Kowalczuk et al. 2008). ACE2 has also been subverted into acting as the cellular receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the associated down-regulation of surface ACE2 following infection predisposes to the acute, and potentially fatal, lung injury in the disease. Hence in a number of distinct disorders: SARS infection, cardiovascular disease, liver fibrosis and diabetes, effects all mediated through impaired angiotensin peptide metabolism, upregulation of ACE2 expression and activity can be beneficial (Turner 2008).\n",

These enzymes are principally involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix, important in tissue remodeling and repair, and hence have trivial names such as collagenases, gelatinases, etc. but are generically referred to as matrix metalloproteases, matrixins or MMPs. Excessive activation of MMPS can result in significant pathological tissue damage as seen, for example, in arthritic conditions. The matrixins are generally synthesized as inactive precursors although differences exist in the activation mechanism. The matrixin proenzymes are held in a catalytically inactive state due to the presence of a \u201ccysteine switch\u201d (Van Wart and Birkedal-Hansen 1990), which involves interaction between a conserved cysteine in the propeptide and the catalytic zinc ion hence preventing the binding and activation of a crucial water molecule. Because of the importance of cysteine in the latency of the proenzymes, they can commonly be activated by thiol-blocking agents such as aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) (see e.g. Allinson et al. 2004).",

NEP is a type II integral membrane protein composed of a short, cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region and a large extracellular region that folds into two domains that enclose a large, central cavity that contains the catalytic site (Oefner et al. 2000). Ten cysteine residues in the extracellular domain are conserved between all family members and are involved in intrachain disulphide bonds required for maintenance of structure and activity (Turner et al. 2001). NEP has important roles in modulating pain (through its actions on enkephalin peptides), blood pressure (through inactivation of atrial natriuretic peptide), prostate cancer (through metabolism of the mitogenic peptide, endothelin-1) and the immune system, being also identical with the common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen, CALLA or CD10 (LeTarte et al. 1988). It was for some long time the only known peptidase in family M13, but additional homologues are now known, including the endothelin converting enzymes (ECE-1 and ECE-2) responsible for the post-translational processing of the protein precursors of the endothelin family of hypertensive peptides (Fig. 19.2). This processing pathway, like many protein processing events involving hormones, neuropeptides and growth factors, involves the initial removal of the N-terminal signal prepeptide to generate a physiologically inactive proprotein subsequently processed in the secretory pathway at dibasic cleavage sites to its active form by one of the seven subtilisin-like proprotein convertases, which include furin (Rholam and Fahy 2009). As intracellular, serine proteases they are not considered further in this chapter. In the endothelin pathway, it is likely that either furin or PC7 catalyses this processing event (Blais et al. 2002). However, the endothelin processing pathway is unusual in protein processing events since the product of prohormone convertase action is another physiologically inert intermediate, termed \u201cbig endothelin,\u201d which is in turn converted to the vasoactive endothelin by the metallopeptidase, ECE-1. When first identified, as the most potent, endogenous human vasoconstrictor known at the time, the endothelin system held much hope for development of novel cardiovascular therapeutics such as ECE-1 inhibitors, a promise that has yet to be fulfilled (Kirkby et al. 2008).\n",

Several of the NEP-like enzymes are, as yet, orphan peptidases with no recognized peptide substrates. Invertebrate species contain considerably more NEP-like proteases (more than 20 genes in Drosophila), which are involved in events such reproduction, embryogenesis, renal function, as well as other behavioural traits (Thomas et al. 2005; Bland et al. 2009). The 3D structures of both NEP and ECE-1, each complexed with the inhibitor phosphoramidon, have been solved providing detailed mechanistic insight into the similarities and differences between these two metallopeptidases (Oefner et al. 2000; Schulz et al. 2009).",

Endogenous physiological inhibitors of NEP have been described \u2013 sialorphin and opiorphin \u2013 which have analgesic activity of comparable potency to morphine, which is consistent with their inhibition of enkephalin inactivation by NEP (Rougeot et al. 2003; Wisner et al. 2006). In recent years, much attention has focused on a newly discovered physiological activity of both NEP and ECE, namely their ability to degrade the neurotoxic Alzheimer\u2019s amyloid peptide, A\u03b2 (Iwata et al. 2000). Up-regulation of NEP (or ECE) may therefore provide an option for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by stimulating clearance of A\u03b2 \u2013 a therapeutic example of enhancing protein processing (Belyaev et al. 2009). While the homologous NEP and ECE serve complementary roles in A\u03b2 metabolism, they play opposing roles in the progression of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer through their respective effects on endothelin maturation (ECE-1) and inactivation (NEP) (Fig. 19.3). Hence, upregulation of prostatic NEP or downregulation of ECE-1 could provide therapeutic options for this untreatable and aggressive stage of prostate cancer (Papandreou et al. 1998; Dawson et al. 2004).\n",

These range from the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) to the insulin-degrading enzyme (insulysin; IDE). MPP removes an N-terminal targeting signal from mitochondrial precursor proteins hence targeting nuclear-encoded proteins to their correct location within mitochondria. IDE plays a role in insulin metabolism but also may be another physiologically significant amyloid (A\u03b2)-degrading enzyme (Edland 2004). This family are characterized by an inverted zinc-binding domain (HXXEH rather than HEXXH) although the reaction mechanism is similar, namely nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond by a water molecule activated by the zinc and polarized by an active site glutamate residue. The lack of potent or specific inhibitors for peptidases of this family has significantly hindered studies of their physiological functions, particularly in the case of IDE. However, mice with targeted deletion of the IDE gene show hyperinsulinaemia and glucose intolerance as well as increased accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain supporting the proposed protein processing roles for the enzyme (Farris et al. 2003).",

Eukaryotic peptidases from family M48 have a requirement for substrates that are prenylated at a C-terminal motif known as a CAAX box, in which A is an aliphatic residue, and the lipid is attached to the cysteine residue. Protein prenylation enhances membrane association of proteins. Human farnesylated-protein converting enzyme 1 may be important for processing prelamin A, a farnesylated protein that is cleaved twice. In cells with a defective peptidase gene, incompletely processed prelamin A accumulates in the nuclear envelope. Farnesylated-protein converting enzyme 1 performs the second processing step for prelamin A, releasing a 15-residue peptide containing the prenylated C-terminal Cys (Pendas et al. 2002). The Oma1 endopeptidase is believed to degrade misfolded membrane proteins, thereby helping to maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Kaser et al. 2003). Deficiencies in lamin A, a component of the nuclear lamina, lead to abnormalities in the nuclear architecture, and knockouts of farnesylated-protein converting enzyme 1 in mice cause growth retardation, muscular dystrophy and premature death (Bergo et al. 2002).",

For example, following an initial cleavage in the lumen of the Golgi by the serine protease, (site-1 protease, S1P) (Bartz et al. 2008), the zinc metallopeptidase S2P releases the N-terminal transcription factor domain, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), from its membrane-bound precursor (Fig. 19.4).

However, the selective proteolysis of cell-surface proteins by proteases, commonly referred to as secretases or sheddases, is a more recent discovery, which is providing insight into a number of pathological conditions (see e.g. van Goor et al. 2009 for recent review). We first observed that the metalloproteinase ACE, which itself is an ectoenzyme at the endothelial cell-surface, could be released or shed from the membrane through the action of another distinct integral membrane proteinase, inhibitable by EDTA, and hence presumably a metalloenzyme (Hooper et al. 1987). Hence, the soluble form of ACE found in plasma and used diagnostically to assess the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor therapy is derived as a result of a highly specific post-translational processing of the membrane-bound form of ACE. The physiological function of soluble ACE, if other than a down-regulation mechanism, is unknown although the soluble ectodomain could conceivably act as a ligand for another protein. ACE secretase, as we subsequently named the proteolytic activity, has turned out to be the prototype for a family of such membrane protein secretases or sheddases, which cause the release of specific membrane proteins, normally from the cell-surface into the extracellular medium (Hooper et al. 1997; Huovila et al. 2005).",

In many cases, these shedding processes are inhibited by certain hydroxamate compounds originally developed as MMP inhibitors (e.g. batimastat). Principally through studies on one of these secretases, the tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM17), which causes the post-translational release of active TNF-\u03b1 into the blood from its membrane-bound precursor, pro-TNF, these secretases have mainly been identified as members of the ADAM gene family: multi-domain, membrane proteins that generally (but not always) have both metalloproteinase and adhesion activities (Seals and Courtneidge 2003).",

The structures of the catalytic domains of ADAM17 and ADAM33 have been solved and show many similarities, typical aspects being a central five-stranded \u03b2-sheet surrounded by five \u03b1-helices including the Met-turn, a feature of all metzincin proteases (Maskos et al. 1998; Orth et al. 2004).",

Examples include heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), TGF\u03b1 and neuregulin. ADAM17 seems to be important (but not exclusive) to the shedding of these ligands and itself can be activated through activation of G protein-linked receptors by, for example, thrombin, endothelin-1 and angiotensin II. This process of indirect, receptor-mediated activation of the EGF receptor through ADAM-mediated protein processing has been termed transactivation and has particular implications in vascular remodelling and in cancer. In some cases, MMPs rather than ADAMs may contribute to shedding events. For example, MMP-9 may mediate the shedding of the \u03b22 integrin subunit (CD18) from macrophages, N-cadherin and also the soluble CD40 ligand involved in platelet activation (Vaisar et al. 2009; Dwivedi et al. 2009; Mench\u00e9n et al. 2009).",

The cellular prion protein, which is essential for the development of a prion disease occurs both as a glycolipid-anchored membrane form and as a soluble, secreted form (Parkin et al. 2004). Both ADAM9 and ADAM10, but not ADAM17, contribute to prion shedding and, intriguingly, the ADAM9-mediated shedding is an indirect process acting via ADAM10, which cleaves the prion protein only three residues away from the site of addition of the lipid anchor (Gly228-Arg229) (Taylor et al. 2009). However, this shedding process does not appear to regulate the conversion of the prion protein to its transmissible neurotoxic form. Not surprisingly, in the light of its close involvement in the development of dementia, the complex processing of APP has been studied far more intensively and has led to a number of possible therapeutic avenues involving manipulation of protease activity or expression for treatment of the disease, some of which are currently in clinical trials.",

It was the A\u03b2 peptide which was originally identified as the main constituent of the extracellular neuritic plaques which characterize AD (Glenner and Wong 1984; Masters et al. 1985) and led to the formulation of the \u201camyloid cascade\u201d hypothesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Hardy and Higgins 1992). Accumulation of A\u03b2 is a characteristic feature of AD and its prevention is a primary target in therapeutic strategies. Late-onset forms of AD may primarily be due to deficiencies in A\u03b2 clearance rather than its formation (Hama and Saido 2005) and hence understanding clearance mechanisms and their regulation could be of fundamental importance and provide novel approaches to AD treatment. The exact role of the C-terminal proteolytic product AICD remains unclear and controversial but it probably acts as a transcriptional regulator together with the APP-tail binding protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase (HAT), Tip60 (Cao and S\u00fcdhof 2001; Belyaev et al. 2009) (Fig. 19.5).\n",

Metabolism of APP can undergo either an \u201camyloidogenic\u201d pathway through the action of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases and production of A\u03b2, or a non-amyloidogenic pathway, when APP is cleaved by \u03b1-secretase (Hooper and Turner 2002). \u03b1-Secretase cleaves APP inside of the A\u03b2 sequence between lysine and leucine in positions 16 and 17, and prevents formation of the A\u03b2 peptide. Hence, inhibition of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and activation of the activity of \u03b1-secretase are possible approaches for prevention of AD (Lichtenthaler and Haass 2004).",

However, the regulated \u03b1-secretase activity, stimulated by cholinergic agonists such as muscarine and carbachol (Canet-Aviles et al. 2002) or phorbol esters (Zhu et al. 2001), is reported to be localised mainly intracellularly (Jolly-Tornetta and Wolf 2000). In transgenic mice expressing human APP moderate neuronal overexpression of ADAM10 was shown to reduce the formation of A\u03b2 and prevent its deposits in the plaques. In contrast, expression of a mutant inactive ADAM10 led to an increase in the number and size of amyloid plaques in the brain of the same transgenic mice (Postina et al. 2004). Transgenic mice lacking ADAM10 or ADAM17 genes are lethal, suggesting that \u03b1-secretase plays an important role in the viability of the organism (Killar et al. 1999), although these enzymes do have other important developmental and regulatory roles.",

            "text": "Formation of amyloidogenic A\u03b2 requires the activity of the transmembrane aspartic proteases, \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases (Fig. 19.5). \u03b2-secretase is also known as BACE-1 and its biochemistry and cell biology are described in detail (Hunt and Turner 2009). Therapeutically, BACE1 provides an attractive drug target for AD since BACE knockout mice do not form A\u03b2 and appear to be healthy (Luo et al. 2001). Numerous approaches have been undertaken to find a clinically effective inhibitor of human \u03b2-secretase activity, mostly in the field of peptidomimetic, noncleavable substrate analogues (Hunt and Turner 2009). However, new endogenous protein substrates are continually being discovered for BACE-1, e.g. it cleaves membrane proteins APLP-1 and -2, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), membrane-bound sialyltransferase and LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP), and so caution is needed since BACE may have unexpected physiological roles. Most recently, BACE-1 is known to be required for proper myelination to occur through its processing of neuregulin (Willem et al. 2006). The cytosolic fragment of APP formed by BACE (C99) is then a substrate for \u03b3-secretase (Fig. 19.5). The latter represents a complex of several proteins involving presenilin proteins as the catalytic core. They are intramembrane proteases like the S2P protein but representing a different catalytic class of proteinase (aspartic rather than metallo). The signal peptide peptidases also represent aspartic intra-membrane proteases. There are also examples of serine-type intra-membrane proteases, e.g. rhomboid proteases (Wolfe 2009).",

            "text": "Until recently, accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain and other tissues was thought to be an irreversible process, leading to development of AD. However, in the brain there are biochemical pathways for elimination of A\u03b2 (Nalivaeva et al. 2008). In the last few years, several proteases, such as the metalloenzymes NEP, IDE, ECE-1 and ECE-2, as well as the serine proteinase plasmin have been found to be capable of degrading A\u03b2 in vitro and in vivo (Leissring et al. 2003; Turner et al. 2004). Most of these act extracellularly either as membrane-bound (ECE-1, NEP) or as soluble extracellular proteins (IDE, plasmin). IDE is anomalous in terms of its subcellular distribution since it is largely cytosolic (Akiyama et al. 1988) but also occurs within some organelles (mitochondria, peroxisomes) as well as in a soluble, secreted form yet it lacks any secretory signal in its sequence (Zhao et al. 2009). The mechanism of its secretion remains an enigma and it has been termed an \u201cunconventionally secreted protein\u201d (Zhao et al. 2009). Figure 19.5 shows schematically A\u03b2 peptide aggregation and its proteolytic degradation by these various enzymes. Pathological down-regulation of these enzymes could predispose to accumulation of A\u03b2 and the development of AD. Thus, a possible therapeutic approach for treatment of AD might be a chronic up-regulation of one or more of these proteases, either pharmacologically or through a gene therapy approach. These proteases are localised in a variety of subcellular compartments and cell types in the brain and remove A\u03b2 prior to its accumulation.",

This has particularly been the case in relation to the potential feedback regulation of the A\u03b2-degrading enzyme, NEP (Pardossi-Piquard et al. 2005; Chen and Selkoe 2007). However, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have established that NEP expression is directly regulated through acetylation of core histones on the NEP promoter mediated via AICD and the inhibition of histone deacetylation with histone deacetylase inhibitors such as the anti-convulsant drug, valproate, or trichostatin A can potentiate NEP expression and activity (Belyaev et al. 2009). Valproate treatment in vivo in mice can reduce amyloid plaque formation (Qing et al. 2008) (Fig. 19.5). These observations add to the growing body of literature (Saha and Pahan 2006; Fischer et al. 2007) emphasizing the potential beneficial effects of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, in this case through manipulation of metalloprotease expression.",

Although epithelial cells produce the mitogenic peptide ET1 it is inactivated by NEP and does not stimulate cell growth. The stromal cells produce low levels of ECE-1 converting big ET-1 into ET-1 and this action is again opposed by the action of NEP. When androgen levels are low as in typical therapeutic surgical or drug regimes, NEP levels decrease allowing mitogenic peptides produced by epithelial cells to exhibit their growth-promoting effect.

APP is a constitutive, transmembrane protein which undergoes proteolytic cleavage by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases producing a soluble ectodomain referred to as sAPP\u03b2, the neurotoxic amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). A\u03b2 has the property to form neurotoxic oligomers and then to aggregate further, ultimately forming the so-called senile plaques, which are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This APP processing pathway is considered amyloidogenic in contrast with the cleavage of APP by the metalloproteinase \u03b1-secretase (ADAM protein) within the A\u03b2 domain, which prevents formation of A\u03b2. This non-amyloidogenic processing leads to formation of the soluble ectodomain sAPP\u03b1, a short peptide p3 and AICD. AICD binds to the neprilysin (NEP) promoter and activates neprilysin expression (NEP) (Belyaev et al. 2009). This binding requires AICD stabilisation by Fe65 and also involves the histone-acetyl transferase, Tip60. AICD also controls expression of some other genes. If the NEP gene is silenced through histone deacetylation by HDACs, expression of NEP is inhibited. However, incubation of cells with VA, and hence inhibition of HDACs, allows AICD to bind to the NEP promoter and re-activate NEP expression (Belyaev et al. 2009). NEP, a cell-surface ectopeptidase, in turn, degrades A\u03b2 and reverses amyloid plaque accumulation. A\u03b2 can also be cleaved by ECE-1, ACE, matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) and by the serine peptidase, plasmin. Cleavage of A\u03b2 can occur within the cells, at the cell surface (both along the neurites and cell bodies) and in the extracellular space. NEP and plasmin between them can cleave monomeric and oligomeric forms of A\u03b2 (Nalivaeva et al. 2008)",
