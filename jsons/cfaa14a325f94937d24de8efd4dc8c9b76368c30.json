Two months later, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced SARS-CoV-2 as the name for the new virus and COVID-19 for the associated illness. On March 12, 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The scientific community has raced to find effective therapeutic agents against the virus. Gautret et al 2020 is among one of the first purportedly positive trials of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. However, it is imperative that a thorough analysis and understanding of trial data be undertaken prior to making claims about safety and efficacy. Our group assessed the statistical robustness of the trial using the Fragility Index (FI). The FI provides a numerical quantification of a clinical trial's conclusions. The index is based on iterative statistical calculations to determine the minimum number of events within a trial that would theoretically need to change from positive to negative in order for the trial's endpoint to convert from significant to non-significant; the higher the index, the more statistically robust the study results. For the Gautret et al trial, one endpoint had an FI of 1, two had indices of 2, and another had an index of 4. The primary endpoint of viral clearance on day 6 had an FI of 4. This indicates that if 4 events were to change from positive to negative, the conclusion of the trial would become mathematically non-significant. This index is comparable to many other published trials of established agents; the median FI across the reported literature appears to be 2. In conclusion, the trial results reported by Gautret et al are statistically robust, assuming that data quality is not compromised; however, the study was an open-label trial with non-homogenous groups, with analysis conducted per-protocol.",

Such findings are especially important during a public health crisis, where scientific discoveries need to be both rigorous and timely. Positive trial results could motivate the scientific community to use the agents in infected patients, or commit funding and clinical resources to explore this drug regimen further. However, it is important to pause for a moment to ensure that the purportedly positive trial results are indeed robust. Making inferences about this regimen without robust results may take away precious time and resources related to other promising therapies. Furthermore, the benefits of a new regimen need to be weighed against its potential harms; therefore, hydroxychloroquine use needs to be carefully weighed against potential harms such as prolonging of the QTc interval which can be life threatening.",

To assess for robustness of a positive trial, a Fragility Index (FI) could be calculated. As described by Walsh et al [7] , this index complements the p-value by informing the robustness of results. The index was developed by leaders in the field of evidence-based medicine, including Guyatt and Sackett, to provide information beyond the much criticized, but commonly reported p-value. The FI is most applicable and useful in trials with small numbers of events where the p-values can often erroneously suggest that a trial is positive; this may be the case for the small-sample trial published by Gautret et al. The index adds information beyond that provided by historically used measures such as p-value, number of events, confidence interval and sample size.",

This would suggest that if as little as one event changed, the trial would have become statistically non-significant. It is unclear how this compares to other currently proposed agents against COVID-19 -two clinical trials of remdesivir in China were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04252664 and NCT04257656) but suspended due to poor enrolment, with no results publicly available; other trials are still ongoing. This trial remains the only peer reviewed published COVID-19 drug treatment study. Though the Gautret et al study has low indices, these indices are comparable to many other published trials. Evaniew et al reviewed 40 orthopedic spine surgery trials and reported a median FI of 2 [8]. Pediatric orthopedic trials have a median FI of 3, according to a review by Khormaee et al of 17 trials",

The results of Gautret et al are as robust, statistically, as 50% of published trials[12].Though reviewed in greater detail in other publications, a critical appraisal of the Gautret et al does highlight some aspects pertinent to the interpretation of the FI. Gautret et al have published essentially preliminary data from a practical and ongoing trial as they treated their first patients in Marseille, France. Thirty-six hospitalized patients with positive nasopharyngeal sample positive PCR results were included (20 treatment group and 16 untreated controls). Patients received hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg three times per day for ten days, while six patients in the treatment group also received azithromycin. A comparison group was collected primarily in Marseille, Avignon, Briancon, and Nice. The primary endpoint was clearance of the virus on RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal specimens on Day 6. Six patients were not included as they were lost to follow up. This is pertinent given that the FI indicates that the number of patients required to change the conclusion is 4. However, Walsh et al in their review of randomized trials published in high impact journals found that 52.9% of trials had higher loss to follow up levels than their Fragility Indices. The results of Gautret et al in this respect are similar to other published trials.",

The Fragility Index is only one method to provide insight into the value of a trial and has limitations. For example, the application to non-randomized trials is controversial as it lacks control of confounding variables. To further understand the results of Gautret et al and its applicability to future research and practice, focus should be spent on epidemiological aspects (i.e. trial design to control for confounder, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and choice of outcome), such as the analysis published by Kim et al [13]. In conclusion, the trial results reported by Gautret et al are statistically robust relative to other trials, but ideally need a higher Fragility Index and further investigation before the proposed regimen can be considered a viable treatment for COVID-19. Further analyses of the trial should be through the lens of epidemiology and clinical significance. Given the statistically robust results reported by Gautret et al, despite the study's inherent methodological and analytical flaws, hydroxychloroquine should be studied as a potential agent against COVID-19 in larger clinical trials.",
