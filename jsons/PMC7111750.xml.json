In addition, although the use of vaccines has reduced large-scale IBV outbreaks, the vaccine alone is not sufficient to inhibit IBV (Jackwood et al., 2005). Therefore, antiviral drug studies of IBV have been conducted using various extracts and proteins. Huawei showed that forsythoside A is an antiviral agent that protects primary chicken embryo kidney cells against IBV (Li et al., 2011). Zhang et al. (2017) demonstrated that chicken mannose binding lectin (cMBL) plays a role in immunity, induces viral aggregation, and reduces IBV infection (Zhang et al., 2017). Another study reported using swine intestine antimicrobial peptides (SIAMP) in chick embryos; with inhibition of viral replication and decreases in the pathological changes induced by IBV (Sun et al., 2010).",

In each group, 5 chickens were directly infected with IBV using an intraocular inoculation method, and 15 chickens were placed in the same space to measure the contact infection rate. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected from both the direct infection and contact transmission groups on the 3rd and 5th days after IBV infection, and the viral shedding levels were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. The directly infected group showed similar viral RNA transcription levels among the 3D8 scFv tg, sibling wild type, and positive control (SPF) chickens (data not shown).

However, confirming the effects was difficult in the direct infection group. In our previous study on the antiviral effect against AIV, we noted that \u201cbecause the level of 3D8 scFv expression failed to induce apoptosis, the transgenic cells did not undergo apoptosis\u201d (Byun et al., 2017). Moreover, cytosolically localized 3D8 scFv triggered apoptotic cell death via its nuclease activity (Jang et al., 2009). In other words, a high 3D8 scFv protein expression level cannot be expected in chickens. If 3D8 scFv tg chickens are challenged with a viral titer exceeding the critical point at which an antiviral effect occurs, antiviral effects against the virus will not be observed in the tg chickens. However, in the case of the contact transmission group, the amount of virus derived from the directly infected chickens will represent the exposure, and the exposure dose might be lower than that inoculated into directly-infected chickens. Therefore, antiviral effects can be expected to occur in chickens with low 3D8 scFv expression.",

Also, it is infected in the respiratory tract, gut, kidney, and reproductive system of chicken which ultimately affects meat and egg production (Awad et al., 2014). A number of antiviral studies have been conducted against IBV in response to these problems (Harrison et al., 2007; Jackwood et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Shojai et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). In the present study, we investigated resistance against IBV in chickens using 3D8 scFv. The 3D8 scFv tg chickens exhibited a reduction in shedding based on quantitation of viral RNA in the oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and reduced antibody titers against IBV. Many studies have confirmed the antiviral effects based on the nuclease activity of 3D8 scFv in rats, humans, and chickens (Jun et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015; Byun et al., 2017). The nuclease activity of 3D8 scFv may be used as an antiviral agent for most viruses that have DNA or RNA as their genetic material. The development of a broad range of therapeutic agents for viruses with various mutations is very urgent and necessary. Ensuing studies will examine whether 3D8 scFv is effective against a variety of chicken viruses.",
