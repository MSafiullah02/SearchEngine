One useful indicator of virus transmissibility is the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the number of secondary cases per index case in a fully susceptible population. When R0 is above 1, epidemic potential has been reached. We aimed to adapt a recently published method of estimating R0\n11 to the MERS-CoV outbreaks and compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.",

In May, 2013, a large cluster of 23 confirmed cases was reported in the Al-Hasa governorate, Saudi Arabia.

We took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases. We excluded the nine cases notified in the 2 weeks preceding June 21, 2013, because the incubation period of MERS-CoV could be up to 14 days, so these cases might belong to current transmission clusters.16 For improved modelling consistency, we also took into account seven probable cases: (1) one case, a patient who travelled from Saudi Arabia to Tunisia where two of his children, who had subsequent contact with him, tested positive; (2) the fourth case of the family cluster detected in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in October, 2012 (a patient aged 16 years who was symptomatic but was not tested for MERS-CoV);14 (3) cases A and C, reported as probable in the investigation of the Al-Hasa cluster;15 and (4) three cases in the Jordanian cluster. The large number of unconfirmed cases (11 of 13) in the Jordanian cluster called for caution. On the basis of a 38% case-fatality ratio in individuals younger than 60 years (see summary statistics in the Results section), and considering that the patients with the two confirmed cases in the Jordanian cluster died, we estimated that the expected cluster size could be 2/0\u00b738, which is roughly 5. Hence, we considered three additionally probable cases next to the two confirmed ones in the Jordanian cluster. We also did a sensitivity analysis of our results, varying the size of the Jordanian cluster between two and 13 (appendix).",

First, we used published epidemiological investigations of MERS-CoV clusters (ie, the Jordanian,12 UK,4 French,13 Al-Hasa,15 and Riyadh14 clusters) to provide information about their tree structure. Second, we regarded the MERS-CoV clusters detected outside the Middle East as trees generated by the patient travelling outside the Middle East. Third, we made assumptions on the occurrence of transmission events on the basis of epidemiological links between cases to investigate the clusters that remained otherwise unresolved. We regarded cases as epidemiologically linked if the patients were either close family members or had documented contact and, furthermore, if the dates of onset were separated by the minimum incubation period (ie, 2 days15). Hence, we did not consider infectiousness outside the symptomatic period, since no data support it at present, and all transmission data available so far are compatible with transmission during the symptomatic phase.15 This feature was also true for SARS-CoV.2\n",

Our first scenario assumes a large number of index patients per cluster, each generating a small tree, which results in a high introduction rate of the virus into the human population and a moderate transmissibility. The two cluster partitioning rules of the first scenario are that a report of an epidemiological link between two infected individuals certifies that transmission occurred between these individuals, and that all unlinked individuals are sporadic cases. However, we note that two epidemiologically linked cases might have become infected after common MERS-CoV exposure. Hence, the first rule is a modelling choice that can be refined as further data become available. According to scenario 1, we regarded two Saudi Arabian clusters of two and four cases (the cluster of four cases located in Riyadh14) as single trees since they consisted of family members. The cluster of five reported in Dammam was partitioned into three sporadic cases and one tree of two cases, since two of the patients shared a hospital room. We split the Jordanian cluster into three sporadic cases and a tree of two cases (patient 3 and his brother, patient 8).12\n",

However, the speed of adaptation depends on several variables, some of which might widely differ between China and the Middle East (eg, animal and human density, baseline preventive measures, and, most importantly, the prepandemic R0).18 Because of the very small number of MERS-CoV sequences available, non-synonymous mutations suggesting viral adaptation could not be yet established.

The dark blue and red dashed lines correspond to the values of R0 that we calculated for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. (B) Contour plot of the expected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) yearly incidence versus introduction rate into the human population and R0. The very dark blue region corresponds to yearly incidence estimates below 10. The dark red region corresponds to yearly incidence estimates above 320. All other solid colour regions correspond to yearly incidence estimates bounded by the values shown on the contours. The black square and red circle show the parameter sets of scenarios 1 and 2, respectively; the error bars represent the corresponding 95% CIs. As a visual aid, we have shaded the region comprising the parameter sets compatible with scenarios 1, 2, and the in-between area compatible with intermediate scenarios. (C) The probability that R0 exceeds 1 versus the size of the next MERS-CoV transmission tree; the horizontal dashed line corresponds to the 5% probability. (D) The probability that R0 exceeds 1 versus the size of the next count of secondary cases of an index patient; the horizontal dashed line corresponds to the 5% probability. R0=basic reproduction number (the number of secondary cases per index case in a fully susceptible population).",
