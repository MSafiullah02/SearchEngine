In 2009, we initiated the Community-based Collaborative Innovation (CCI) project for the prevention and control of major infectious diseases including AIDS, hepatitis B and TB, which were in the list of Major Special Projects in the National Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development (2006\u20132020) in China. The primary objective of CCI project was to explore the epidemiological baseline, influencing factors, and trend of three major diseases. And the long-range objective was to reduce morbidity and mortality of three diseases and to improve the capability of community healthcare to deal with infectious diseases in CCI areas by 2020.",

To understand the prevalence of HBV in China, Chinese National Health Department carried out national HBV sero-epidemiological investigations in 1979, 1992 and 2006. The results showed HBsAg carrier rates in 1\u201359 aged people was 8.75, 9.75 and 7.18%, respectively. [1\u20133] According to the result of 2006 screening, the estimated number of chronic HBV cases was 93 million in China. [4] In January 2006, Chinese National Health Department added HBV to National Disease Control and Prevention Plan List, indicating that HBV control was crucial for infectious diseases control in China. In general, the lack of HBV vaccinations in adults was responsible for HBV epidemic, indicating that national HBV vaccination for whole population (including infants and adults) holds greater promise for long-term treatment. [5, 6] Therefore, we conducted this CCI-HBV field research to explore a series of questions: the cause of HBV high prevalence in China, the different prevention strategies for different groups, the prognosis of HBV carriers, and the way to achieve periodic follow-up in local residents.",

The coverage vaccination rate of 1992 program ranged from 91.7 to 99.9%. [19] To further reduce the prevalence of HBV, a new vaccination program was implemented in CCI-HBV areas in 2011 (2011 Program), aimed at all healthy adults (HBsAb seronegative) and infants. As part of HBV-FTVT Strategy, 2011 program was different from 1992 program in many aspects including that the 10 \u03bcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was used to achieve immunization effect in CCI-HBV areas. [20] Together, the 1992 and 2011 Programs reduced HBsAg carrier rate in < 15 years-old in Zhejiang province to less than 1%. [19] The 2011 Program confirmed that universal vaccination acted as a protection by creating an immune barrier. [21] In harnessing the power of existing community healthcare programs, CCI areas have achieved long-term follow-up of HBV infections to verify the transformation of HBV carriers (the new infection rate, etc) and apply standard antiviral therapies to reduce patient mortality. These measures led to the HBV mortality in Zhejiang province decreased from 1.54% (2010) to 0.98% (2015). According to the screening data, the second round of HBsAg prevalence has decreased compared with the first round with significant difference. This also proves the effectiveness of CCI comprehensive intervention. In addition, the study of HBV new infection transformation is ongoing.",
