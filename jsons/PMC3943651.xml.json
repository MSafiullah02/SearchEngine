More patients with ARDS are now surviving to hospital discharge, a phenomenon that has been reported in both observational studies and randomized trials [9\u201311]. For example, 60-day mortality decreased from 40 % in the traditional tidal volume arm of the ARDS network ARMA study published in 2000 to 21 % in the most recent ARDS network trial published in 2011, in spite of increased severity of illness and more comorbidities in the more recent trial [1, 12]. However, less is known about the epidemiology of long-term survival in ARDS, particularly in the context of increasing severity of illness and comorbidities among ICU patients today [13].",

In-hospital mortality in these studies was higher at 37\u201340 %, as these cohorts predated widespread implementation of low tidal volume ventilation. Furthermore, patients who survived to hospital discharge and were selected for these studies were young (mean age mid-40 s), had few coexisting conditions, and lower severity of illness on presentation. More recent data demonstrate a widening difference between ARDS survival at discharge and long-term follow-up [11, 18, 19]. This \u201csurvival gap\u201d suggests that while modern ICU interventions have resulted in short-term improvements in ARDS survival, the overall survival after ARDS may not have improved. Temporal changes in ICU patient characteristics including increased severity of illness and more comorbid illnesses may explain some of the changes in trajectory of illness following discharge [13].",

A small study predating low tidal volume ventilation found that comorbidities, ARDS risk factor, and age were most highly associated with mortality 6 months following ARDS diagnosis [30], but the influence of increased severity of illness over time has not been assessed. A more recent study found that the survival benefits of adherence to low tidal volume ventilation persisted at 2 years follow-up, suggesting that modern changes in clinical practice may provide long-standing improvements in survival [19]. However, this study excluded sicker patients with cancer or life-limiting disease\u2014diagnoses that are frequent in patients presenting with ARDS.

Diagnosis of ALI/ARDS was defined by the AECC definition (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264300 mmHg for ALI and PaO2/FiO2 \u2264200 mmHg for ARDS) [33], and could be established at any time during the first 4 days in the ICU. Both mechanically ventilated (defined as invasive mechanical ventilation within 4 days of AECC ALI/ARDS diagnosis) and not mechanically ventilated patients meeting AECC criteria were included in our primary analysis. In a sensitivity analysis, we also considered the Berlin definition for ARDS [34, 35]. Berlin severity levels were defined as mild (200 mmHg <PaO2/FiO2 \u2264300 mmHg with PEEP or CPAP \u22655 cmH2O), moderate (100 mmHg <PaO2/FiO2 \u2264200 mmHg with PEEP \u22655 cmH2O), and severe (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264100 mmHg with PEEP \u22655 cmH2O). For both AECC and Berlin definitions, the ratio of pulse oximetric saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) was used as a validated surrogate for PaO2/FiO2 among patients without an arterial blood gas measurement at the time of ALI/ARDS diagnosis: SpO2/FiO2 = 64 + 0.84 \u00d7 (PaO2/FiO2) [36]. The discharge location for patients who survived hospitalization was categorized as home, rehabilitation hospital, nursing home, hospice, or other acute care hospital.

We sought to quantify the survival gap between short- and long-term ARDS mortality and identify risk factors for death and causes of death at 1 year for hospital survivors. In this study of a broad, heterogeneous cohort of critically ill patients with ALI/ARDS, overall hospital mortality was 24 %, concordant with short-term mortality rates of ALI/ARDS mortality reported in the era of low tidal volume ventilation [10, 11], and 1-year mortality was substantially higher at 41 %, consistent with other recent studies [11, 18, 19]. This finding did not vary according to etiology of ARDS or in the presence of sepsis. Furthermore, in a large subgroup of patients followed for 2 years, we found that more than half of the patients with ALI/ARDS had died. Disposition after hospitalization was highly associated with 1-year mortality, suggesting that functional status after discharge may be an important contributing factor to long-term mortality after ARDS. The independent predictors of death at 1 year were age, living somewhere other than home prior to admission, and serious comorbidities. Although several measures of severity of illness and characteristics of hospital course were associated with long-term mortality among hospital survivors, only length of hospital stay remained an independent predictor of long-term mortality in a stepwise elimination model. Restriction of the analysis to patients meeting the Berlin definition for ARDS did not change the findings, and Berlin level of severity of ARDS did not predict long-term mortality in hospital survivors.",

Although short-term mortality in ARDS has decreased in the last decade, our findings expand upon other recent studies demonstrating a widening survival gap between ARDS survival at discharge and long-term follow-up [11, 18, 19]. This gap suggests that while modern ICU interventions have improved short-term outcomes in ARDS, other factors contribute to a persistently high long-term mortality in ARDS. One possible explanation is the temporal changes in characteristics of ICU patients over the last several decades. Large studies have demonstrated that older age, the number of comorbidities, and the severity of illness have increased both in the general ICU population and in ARDS patients specifically [10, 13]. ICU treatment cannot address the underlying comorbidities and increasing age that ultimately contribute to high long-term mortality in ICU patients today. Although a recent study found that adherence to low tidal volume ventilation in ARDS was associated with a survival benefit up to 2 years following hospitalization, these conclusions may only be generalizable to the most healthy of ARDS patients because those with significant comorbidities, poor social status, and life-limiting illnesses were excluded from enrollment in the observational study [19].",

In a recent study of Medicare patients, ICU survivors had higher 3-year mortality than non-ICU hospital survivors or non-hospitalized controls, and a separate study showed that critically ill patients have decreased survival for up to 15 years compared to age- and sex-matched population controls [40, 41]. Furthermore, predictors of long-term outcomes for critically ill patients are similar to those we observed in ARDS, with comorbidities as top predictors for subsequent re-hospitalization and death [41]. One possible explanation for the persistently high risk of death in patients with critical illness includes a persistent pro-inflammatory state that may exacerbate or trigger other underlying inflammatory disorders including cardiovascular disease, recurrent infection, cancer, and renal failure\u2014all common causes of death among patients in our study who survived to hospital discharge.",

Because there were very few exclusion criteria for enrollment in VALID, the findings are likely to be generalizable. The study also has some limitations. First, it is a single-center study. However, this is counterbalanced by the broad spectrum of heterogeneous critically ill patients from four different intensive care units included. Second, it is possible that we underestimated the 1-year mortality rate of ARDS survivors; although the SSDI has been shown to be a valuable tool for determining long-term outcomes [39], some patients without social security numbers may not be included. Third, mortality does not capture the full burden of disease. Long-term sequelae of ARDS, including impaired pulmonary function, neuromuscular weakness, and neuropsychiatric are well described [15, 42\u201345]. However, these limitations would have led us to underestimate rather than overestimate long-term effects of ARDS and do not weaken the findings. Finally, we were unable to test the effect of specific ICU interventions such as low-tidal volume ventilation on long-term outcomes.",

            "text": "Long-term mortality is substantially higher than short-term mortality in a broad sample of patients with ARDS. In spite of improvements in supportive care and significantly improved short-term outcomes, long-term outcomes remain poor. The top predictors of 1-year mortality in hospital survivors include non-modifiable factors including age and comorbidities, and the most common causes of death are malignancy and infection. These results underscore the importance of considering the interaction between comorbid illness and ARDS on the trajectory of long-term outcomes in hospital survivors of ARDS for testing new interventions and providing prognoses. Researchers must measure whether effects of interventions can influence the overall trajectory of survival in ARDS patients who do and do not have major comorbidities. Possible clinical applications of such research include improved guidance of initial discussions of prognosis and the benefits of full resuscitation for high-risk patients. For clinical trials, it is perhaps more realistic to target shorter-term endpoints such as 30- to 90-day mortality, since 1-year mortality will be driven primarily by comorbidities that cannot be reversed or influenced by treatments for increasing survival from ARDS such as lung protective or prone ventilation. This study, along with others, demonstrates that premorbid illnesses are the top predictors of long-term outcomes after ARDS in critically ill patients today.",
