            "text": "Living organisms are constantly exposed to pathogens. In any environment, a molecular war begins when a host encounters a pathogen. In many host\u2013pathogen associations, the molecular war is in progress a long time ago. Nevertheless, a disease as an outcome of a pathogen attack remains an exception rather than a rule. Most host species have acquired strategies by selective pressure to mislead the pathogen and to win the fight during their cross talk (i.e., molecular dialogue). However, many pathogen species have acquired strategies by selective pressure to bypass the host defenses to win the molecular war and to ensure the completion of their life cycle. Pathogens remain a significant threat to any host species. Critical to the mitigation of this threat is the ability to rapidly detect, respond to, treat, and contain the pathogen transmission. Since many centuries, some scientific fields (i.e., agroecology, evolutionary ecology, evolutionary medicine, biochemistry, microbiology, medicine, veterinary medicine, immunology, and molecular biology) have surveyed host\u2013parasite interactions to improve our understanding of pathogenic diseases and to prevent pathogen transmission in host populations.",

In Europe, one of the most dramatic disease events was the great plague pandemic of the mid-14th century.1, 2 Notably, pathogenic diseases are a leading cause of premature death in the world. Pathogenic diseases result from an intimate relationship between a host and a pathogen which involves molecular \u201ccross talk.\u201d Clearly, elucidation of this complex molecular dialogue between host and pathogen is desirable in order to improve our understanding of pathogen virulence, to develop pathogen-specific host biomarkers, and to define novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. Proteomics applications to decipher host\u2013parasite interactions are in their infancy in spite of important technological and scientific advances since the post-genomic era, and should lead to new insights on host specificity and on the evolution of pathogen virulence. In this chapter, we present the interest of proteomics to survey host\u2013pathogen interactions, a synthetic review of previous proteomics studies, the pitfalls of the current approach in surveys, new conceptual approaches to decipher host\u2013parasite interactions, a new avenue to decipher the cross-talk diversity involved in trophic interactions in a habitat (i.e., the population proteomics), and a 5-year view for future prospects on proteomics and host\u2013pathogen interactions.",

Proteomics offers an excellent way to study the reaction of the host and pathogen proteomes (i.e., genome-operating systems) during their complex biochemical cross talk.20, 21 Using the first generation proteomics approach, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), and mass spectrometry (MS), posttranslational modifications of host and pathogen proteins (such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and methylation) in reaction to their interaction can be detected. Such modifications are vital for the correct activity of numerous proteins and are being increasingly recognized as a major mechanism in cellular regulation. Although 2-DE offers a high-quality approach for the study of host and/or pathogen proteomes, during the post-genomic era several proteomics approaches (e.g., bottom-up; top-down) and quantitative proteomics strategies have been developed, which complement classical 2-DE (see Fig. 11.1\n).17, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\nTable 11.1\npresents a comparison of the most popular proteomics tools.",

Indeed, the broad immunity has a natural or innate and adaptive component. Innate immunity constitutes the first antimicrobial defense and rapidly induces soluble mediators, such as complement, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines, together with effector cells, such as macrophages and natural killers, in order to control or delay the spreading of the infectious agent. Then a specific response of adaptive immunity will take place to eliminate pathogens that would have survived innate immune response.27 These immune selective pressures have conducted pathogens to develop mechanisms to modulate and alter host responses or to evade phagocytosis. As a result of these host\u2013pathogen interactions, protein expression profiles of the host immune system (susceptibility/tolerance factors) and of the pathogen (virulence/pathogenicity factors) are mutually modified.28, 29, 30\n",

In fact, these molecular dialogues and conflicts can be seen as a chess game between the host immune cell populations and the pathogen populations, in which the pathogen plays with the whites (i.e., it starts the game). Because of differences in host\u2013pathogen organisms' size and ratio, leading to size differences of respective proteomes, the pathogen proteome could be considered as overwhelmed by the host proteome during the interactions. But in terms of immune evasion, this is not limiting because the immune system works on a qualitative basis, which constitutes a second advantage for the pathogen that can induce large-scale damages with low amounts of molecules. By contrast, this represents not only one major limitation to characterize host\u2013pathogen interactions, but also a challenging perspective for proteomics technology. This is why retrospectively proteomics studies were mainly conducted to evidence pathogenic virulence and pathogenicity factors.33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43\n",

In African trypanosomes, the antigenic variation of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) constituting the surface coat of the parasite is well described.44 But as in proteomics study, the parasite population, which has switched the VSG, is so poorly represented that it goes undetected, and therefore always keeps one step ahead of host immune responses. Also in trypanosomatids, Leishmania amastigotes, which establish within macrophage (a major immune effector cell), developed the ability to degrade class II major histocompatibility molecules to prevent Th1-type immunity to be induced.45 Another protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, generates its parasitophorous vacuole with elements of the plasma membrane from the targeted host cells, thus using the host \u201cself\u201d to evade immune recognition.46 These few examples actually perfectly illustrate how difficult it is to decipher, at the protein level during interactions, the pathogen molecular components involved in immune evasion. However, a new quantitative proteomics tools, the SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) lately allowed the detection of 148 proteins of a microsporidian parasite during the kinetics of a host infection.47 Among these proteins, many are involved in parasite proliferation, and an overrepresentation of putative secreted effectors proteins was observed. Finally, this SILAC survey also suggests that this microsporidia species could use a transposable element as a lure strategy to escape the host innate immune system. Advances in proteomics offer challenging perspectives to decipher the molecular war in host\u2013pathogen interactions.26\n",

Several studies performed on this biological sample have allowed discriminating host-commensal from host\u2013pathogen interactions in Candida albicans\n74 and determining the immunome of pathogens.75, 76 Moreover, in African trypanosomiasis, proteomics analysis of the serum not only was indicative of the host response to infection, but also was promising for characterizing disease progression toward neurological disorder.77, 78 This illustrates how proteomics will help in considering at different analytical levels the host proteome response to a pathogen infection, with the prospect of benefits in improving diagnostics and therapeutics.",

This MS-based method requires a minimal amount of sample for analysis and allows the rapid high-throughput analysis of complex protein samples.79 SELDI-TOF-MS differs from conventional matrix\u2013assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-TOF-MS because the target surfaces, to which the proteins and matrices are applied to, are coated with various chemically active ProteinChip surfaces (ion exchange, immobilized metal affinity capture, and reverse phase arrays). Therefore, it is possible to fractionate proteins within a mixture, or particular classes of proteins, on the array surface prior to analysis. As with MALDI, different matrices can be used to facilitate the ionization and desorption of proteins from the SELDI array surface.80\n",

From an evolutionary-ecological point of view, host immune responses to a particular parasite can be plotted on a chart according to the immune mechanisms used (constitutive versus induced) and degree of specificity. The first axis of the defense chart refers to the immune mechanisms employed by the host with the two extreme cases: (1) a constitutive immune mechanism used by the host to rapidly impair the invasion by a parasite and (2) an induced immune mechanism, which has the advantage of avoiding a costly defense system, yet has the disadvantage that the parasite might escape host control.15 The second axis of the defense chart refers to the degree of specificity of the host immune response.",

Instead, human population proteomics focuses on interrogation of a selected number of proteins but from a large number of individuals, to delineate the distribution of specific protein modifications within these subpopulations. Hence, targeted protein analysis approaches utilizing MS as detection method are employed. MS measures a unique feature of each fully expressed protein\u2014its molecular mass. Changes in the protein structure resulting from structural modifications are reflected in its molecular mass and can be detected via MS, without a priori knowledge of the modification. The MS methods utilized in human population proteomics must be capable of analyzing hundreds, if not thousands of samples per day, with high reproducibility and sensitivity. Hence, top-down MS approaches utilizing affinity ligands are the most likely methods of choice for population proteomics.144 Surface-immobilized ligands can be utilized to affinity-retrieve a protein of interest from a biological sample, after which the protein (with or without the affinity ligand) is introduced into a mass spectrometer. One of the first affinity MS methods developed was mass spectrometric immunoassay (MSIA).146 The approach combines targeted protein affinity-extraction with rigorous characterization using MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 11.5\n). Protein(s) are extracted from a biological sample with the help of affinity pipettes derivatized with polyclonal antibodies. The proteins are eluted from the affinity pipettes with a MALDI matrix, and are MS-analyzed. Enzymatic digestion, if needed, is performed on the MALDI target itself. Specificity and sensitivity, as in traditional immunoassays, are dictated by the affinity-capture reagents\u2014the antibodies.",

During data analysis, the major signal in the mass spectrum that corresponds to the targeted protein is initially evaluated; it should be within a reasonable range (e.g., error of measurement of <0.05%) from the value of the empirically calculated mass obtained from the sequence of the protein deposited in the Swiss-Prot databank. Once this mass value is confirmed (or observed to be shifted), the presence of protein modifications is noted by the appearance of other signals in the mass spectra (usually in the vicinity of the native protein peaks), or by mass shifts of the major protein signal. Modifications can be tentatively assigned by accurate measurement of the observed mass shifts (from the wild-type protein signals and/or in silico calculated mass) and knowledge of the protein sequence and possible modifications. The identity of the modifications is then verified using proteolytic digestion and mass mapping approaches in combination with high-performance MS.",

The TTR MSIA assays were performed in parallel on the 96 human plasma samples using affinity pipettes derivatized with anti-TTR antibody. Following MS analysis, data matrix containing all tentatively assigned modifications was assembled. Then, peptide-mapping experiments were performed on selected number of samples to identify the specific modifications and finalize the modifications database. The data for all 25 proteins is presented in Fig. 11.7\n, which lists the modifications observed for 18 of the 25 proteins studied (modifications were not observed for 7 proteins), and shows the frequency of each modification in the 96 samples cohort. A total of 53 protein variants were observed for these 18 proteins, stemming from posttranslational modifications and point mutations. The largest number of posttranslationally modified protein variants was found to be C- or N-terminal truncated protein isoforms. Deglycosylation, oxidation, and cysteinylation were also observed among several of the proteins. Among the point mutations detected for four of the proteins, notable was the high incidence of point mutations for apolipoprotein E and TTR, which is consistent with genomic studies that have found these proteins to be highly polymorphic. The overall frequency of the modifications in the 96 samples cohort was wide ranged. Fourteen modifications were observed in all 96 samples, suggesting that they must be regarded as wild-type protein forms. Others, such as most of the point mutations, were present in only few of the samples. Overall, 23 of the modifications were observed in more than 65% of the samples, and 20 in less than 15% of the 96 samples analyzed. Upon further data analysis, and taking into the consideration the gender, age, and ethnicity of the individuals who provided the samples, it was determined that the Gly6Ser mutation in TTR was detected only in individuals of Caucasian origin, which is consistent with existing knowledge about the occurrence of this common non-amyloidogenic population polymorphism in Caucasians.148, 149 Another correlation was observed in regard to interprotein variations in specific individuals: all seven individuals for which carbohydrate-deficient transferrin was detected were also characterized with deglycosylated antithrombin III.",

The results of the study are summarized in Fig. 11.8\n, which lists the protein modifications observed and the frequency of each in the 1000 samples cohort. A total of 27 protein modifications (20 posttranslational modifications and 7 point mutations) were detected, with various frequencies in the cohort of samples. Variants resulting from oxidation were observed most frequently, along with single amino acid truncations. Least frequent were variants arising from point mutations and extensive sequence truncations. In total, 6 modifications were observed with high frequency (present in >80% of the samples), 5 were of medium frequency (20\u201350% of the samples), and 16 were low-frequency modifications observed in <7% of the samples. Nine of the low-frequency modifications were not observed in the 96 individuals study. Thus, by increasing the size of the population, it became possible to detect these low-occurrence protein modifications. When the frequencies of the modifications in the two studies were compared, an excellent correlation was obtained. For example, in both cohorts about 7% of the individuals were characterized with carbohydrate-deficient transferrin. Upon further data analysis based on the gender, age, and geographical origin of the individuals who provided the samples, it was determined that the samples obtained from California contained significantly less protein modifications than the samples obtained from Florida, Tennessee, and Texas, even though the samples from all four states were collected in the same way within a 3-month window in the spring of 2005, and stored under identical conditions until analysis. Correlations were also made in regard to the gender distribution of two protein modifications. Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin was observed in about 1% of the females and about 10% of the males in the 1000 cohort. Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin is an FDA-approved clinical biomarker for alcoholism, and this gender correlation can partially be explained by the higher prevalence of alcohol dependence in males than in females. The second gender correlation was related to cystatin C: all 10 of the cystatin C point mutations were found in males.",

First, MS is capable of detecting structural protein modifications, and, when coupled to immunoaffinity separations, it can be employed in a high-throughput systematic study of human protein diversity. Second, the human protein diversity is far more complex than the variation observed at the genetic level. While it might be premature to declare the human proteins variation \u201cthe next big thing,\u201d it is reasonable to predict that assessing human proteome variations among and within populations will be a paramount effort that can facilitate biomarker discovery. Such endeavor would represent a paradigm shift in proteomics with significant clinical and diagnostic implications, as protein variations, quantitative and qualitative, begin to be associated with specific diseases.",

Over the past decade, strains of many common pathogens have continued to develop resistance to the drugs that once were effective against them. In the battle against pathogens, humankind has created new mega-technologies, such as massive sequencing, proteomics, and bioinformatics, but without conceptual approaches based on the evolutionary concepts. Parasite genome sequences do not of themselves provide a full explanation of the biology of an organism and on the molecular war involved in host\u2013pathogen associations. Since the 1990s, proteomic tools have been successfully employed in a large number of studies to find and identify proteins involved in biological phenomena, for example, immunity, host\u2013parasite interactions, and so on. Even so, many studies have, as outlined earlier, revealed pitfalls in the approaches used. Thus, whatever the new technological advancements, it is apparent that parasitologists and molecular biologists should attempt to improve their experimental design. This new attitude will surely improve the reliability of the data deriving from proteomics studies and will open the way for an enhanced comprehension of many biological mechanisms. In this chapter, new ways based on evolutionary concepts are suggested to enable further elucidation of the molecular complexities of host\u2013pathogen genome interactions. These new ways could help to increase the knowledge about the molecular war involved in host\u2013pathogen associations taking into account the environmental factors.",
