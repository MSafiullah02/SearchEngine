The space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space (SAS). The vessels within the leptomeninges have a blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) that inhibits leakage of endogenous and exogenous serum compounds under physiological conditions. Infections of the leptomeninges and the SAS cause multiple pathophysiological changes in brain homeostasis. The SAS is infiltrated with inflammatory cells, which release glycoproteins and toxins that affect the tight junctions of the vascular endothelium, leading to a breakdown of the BBB. Serum fluid, proteins, and cells leak into the SAS and the adjacent cortex and cause interstitial and parenchymal edema. The breakdown of the BBB also allows contrast material to leak from the vessels into the CSF. The typical pattern of leptomeningeal enhancement follows the surface of the brain and fills the SAS of the sulci and cisterns. While bacterial and viral meningitis are supposed to exhibit enhancement that is thin and linear, fungal meningitis and neoplastic infiltration of the leptomeninges may produce thicker, lumpy, or nodular enhancement in the SAS. A list of the potential causes of leptomeningeal enhancement is given in Table 1.\n",

The vessels within the dura mater do not produce a BBB; thus, serum compounds, such as albumin, fibrinogen, or contrast agent, can leak into the dura mater. Therefore, the pachymeninges can be seen on contrast-enhanced CT or T1-weighted MR images as a thin, linear, and sometimes discontinuous enhancement, following the inner table of the skull, the falx, and the tentorium cerebelli. Typically, irritation and inflammation of the pachymeninges may arise from various benign or malignant processes, including transient post-operative changes, intracranial hypotension, meningioma, metastases, lymphoma, and granulomatous disease that lead to vasocongestion and interstitial edema of the dura mater (Table 2). Classical imaging features of isolated inflammation of the pachymeninges include thickening and increased enhancement of the dura-arachnoid complex without enhancement of the sulci or brain surface (Fig. 1).\n\n",

Headache is the most common symptom in meningitis and is found in more than 80 % of the patients. Further symptoms indicating irritation of the leptomeninges are nausea, conjunctivitis, hyperesthesia, and hyperacusis. Approximately one fourth of the patients develop petechial rash, with N. meningitidis as the most frequent causative pathogen. One third of the patients have focal neurological deficits such as cranial nerve palsy, aphasia, hemiparesis, or seizures. These symptoms are associated with a lower level of consciousness and indicate a more severe course of the disease; they are more frequent in pneumococcal than in meningococcal meningitis (van de Beek et al. 2004). Bacterial meningitis may be complicated by cortical and subcortical infarctions due to septic vasculitis of the cerebral arteries, hydrocephalus, brain edema, empyema, or pyogenic abscess. Systemic complications result from bacteremia and comprise the Waterhouse\u2013Friderichsen syndrome (e.g., meningococcal sepsis with disseminated intravasal coagulation and petechial bleeding), the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and septic emboli into the lung or peripheral vessels.",

As a sign of beginning disturbance of the CSF circulation, CT might reveal mild enlargement of the ventricles and the SAS; the basal cisterns can be effaced. After administration of contrast medium, CT might demonstrate linear leptomeningeal enhancement in the sulci and cisterns that might increase during the course of the disease, especially if antibiotic treatment is not started or is started with delay (Kastrup et al. 2005). Parenchymal lesions are often difficult to distinguish; however, CT is a simple and fast tool for monitoring critically ill patients and to rule out severe complications of bacterial meningitis, such as resorptive hydrocephalus, swelling, venous thrombosis, or infarction. Besides cerebral structures, CT provides important information about probable pathologies of the skull base, the temporal bone, and the nasal sinus, such as fractures, purulent sinusitis, otitis media, or mastoiditis; therefore, CT of patients with bacterial meningitis should always include a reconstruction of the skull base in the \u201cbony window\u201d.",

Abnormal enhancement of the leptomeninges is usually asymmetrical and extends into the basal cisterns. Besides the importance of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, MRI may reveal an increased signal of the SAS on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating leakage of the BBB with hypercellularity or increased proportions of proteins in the CSF (Fig. 2). When patients with bacterial meningitis develop focal neurological symptoms or seizures, MRI is the tool of choice to diagnose vascular or septic complications (Fig. 3). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is highly sensitive in depicting small cortical or deep white matter infarctions that are hardly seen with conventional MRI, whereas vascular changes can be visualized directly with MRA. Moreover, bacterial meningitis may cause subarachnoid hyperintensity on DWI, predominantly around the frontal lobe, a finding that is often associated with poor prognosis (Kawaguchi et al. 2012). In cases of severe stenosis, vasospasm, or vessel occlusion due to septic vasculitis, PerfMRI may help to get functional information about potential collaterals and the \u201ctissue at risk,\u201d which is clinically helpful in deciding whether or not to use high-dose steroid therapy.\n\n",

The typical imaging feature of TBM is enhancement of the basal cisterns and the corresponding leptomeninges caused by dense fibrinous exudate in the SAS (Fig. 5). Basal meningeal enhancement is found in approximately 60 % of TBM cases. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that tuberculous meningitis is not only seen on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, but also on non-enhanced T1-weighted MT images, showing the inflamed meninges as distinct basal periparenchymal hyperintensity (Kamra et al. 2004). This phenomenon is reported to be missing in patients with meningitis of other etiology; thus, visibility of the meninges on non-enhanced T1-weighted MT images has to be considered highly suggestive of tuberculous meningitis. Yet, one has to keep in mind that formation of exudates requires a competent immune system in the host, as a consequence meningeal enhancement is often less pronounced or even missing in elderly patients and individuals with immune deficiency (Srikanth et al. 2007).\n",
