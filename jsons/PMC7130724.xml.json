            "text": "Canine puppies under one year of age are highly susceptible to gastrointestinal infections. Acute diarrhoea is one of the most common clinical manifestations, potentially leading to severe dehydration and death (Hubbard et al., 2007). Several putative pathogens are associated with acute gastro-enteritis. Canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) are considered the most common viral enteric pathogens in dogs worldwide (Decaro et al., 2011, Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012). Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, and \u03b2-hemolytic Escherichia coli can also be associated with diarrhoea in dogs, but faecal presence of these bacteria in dogs with diarrhoea varies between studies (Marks et al., 2011). Giardia spp., Toxocara spp. and Cystoisospora spp. are parasitic enteropathogens and are often present in puppies, their claimed role as a causative agent however varies per study (Claerebout et al., 2009, Dupont et al., 2013, Grellet et al., 2014). Clostridium difficile is associated with severe diarrhoea in humans and animals but little is known about its pathogenicity in canine puppies (Koene et al., 2012, Wetterwik et al., 2013). The role of Cyniclomyces guttulatus in causing chronic diarrhoea in dogs was indecisive (Mandigers et al., 2014). Several studies have reported the simultaneous presence of multiple canine enteropathogens in dogs with diarrhoea, but studies targeting specifically puppies are rare, usually target puppies in kennels and/or are limited with respect to the number of pathogens that was screened for (Cave et al., 2002, Sokolow et al., 2005, Yesilbag et al., 2007, Stavisky et al., 2011, Tupler et al., 2012, Dupont et al., 2013, Gizzi et al., 2014). The clinical relevance of the co-occurrence of multiple pathogens in faecal samples of dogs remains unclear, as this may simply mirror common exposure, but pathogens can also interact with one another in determining or aggravating disease. It is therefore important to screen for multiple pathogens in faeces of both healthy and diarrhoeic puppies to gain more insight into the role co-infections might play. Putative risk factors for acute infectious diarrhoea in puppies include breed, gender, vaccination history, age, season, breeder-origin, and/or stay in kennel (Houston et al., 1996, Stavisky et al., 2011, Ling et al., 2012, Saevik et al., 2012, Dupont et al., 2013, Bagshaw et al., 2014, Grellet et al., 2014). However these risk factors for infection with specific enteropathogens have mainly been reported in dogs housed in shelters or breeding facilities. The importance of some of these risk factors might be different for privately owned puppies kept under different living conditions.",

They were asked to submit faecal samples from puppies \u22641 year of age with acute diarrhoea (lasting \u226410 days). Diarrhoea was defined as stools that were too loose, and/or expelled too frequently. For each diarrhoeic puppy, the veterinarian was also requested to submit a faecal sample from another puppy under the age of 1 year, without diarrhoea in the three weeks preceding sampling. The samples were either taken directly from the rectum or from already expelled faeces. In case of spontaneous defecation, only the part that did not have contact with the environment was sampled. The samples were taken either by the veterinarian or by the owner, a training leaflet was provided with instructions for proper sampling. All owners were informed and consented with their dogs participating in this study. Sampling was performed by convenience. A maximum of 8 cases and 8 controls were collected per practice. Practices that did not return samples were reminded by e-mail once and they were considered non-participants if they did not reply since. In case of multiple puppies under lactation, a spontaneous sample counted as one dog, as the origin of the faecal sample could not be traced individually.",

After enrichment with BHI (brain heart infusion) broth (Oxoid CM1135) C. difficile selective supplement (Oxoid SR0096) and sodium taurocholate hydrate 97% (Alfa Aesar, A18346) was added to the samples which were then incubated anaerobically for 7 days. Subsequently the samples were inoculated on two different C. difficile selective agar plates: C. difficile selective medium (CDSM, Oxoid PB5054A) and Brazier\u2019s C. difficile selective medium (Brazier, Oxoid PB5191A). Plates were evaluated daily for 4 days and C. difficile like colonies were confirmed via Gram staining and inoculated on a blood agar plate. A glu-D PCR as described in Koene et al. (2012) with minor alterations was performed in order to confirm C. difficile (Koene et al., 2012). DNA was isolated by a boiling method rather than with a purification kit. The PCR mix used for this PCR reaction comprised 25 \u03bcl Hot Start Green Master Mix (including loading buffer), 0.5 \u03bcl Glu-D primer forward, 0.5 \u03bcl Glu-D primer reverse, 19 \u03bcl Nuclease-Free water and 5 \u03bcl isolated DNA, making a total volume of 50 \u03bcl, using primers as described in Koene et al.

The PCR program was adjusted to this master mix by shortening the first heating step of the protocol from 12 to 2 min at 94 \u00b0C (Koene et al., 2012).",

CPV prevalence varies between studies, depending on the inclusion criteria for participation. The prevalence of CPV found in our study (18.9%) fits within the range of other prevalences previously published (respectively 16% and 48.7%) (Schulz et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2011).The most distinctive clinical signs associated with CPV observed here match the typical signs described in the literature. Bloody diarrhoea was reported in 40.0% of the puppies and one third of these puppies were CPV-positive. The occurrence of CPV infections in asymptomatic puppies can be explained by low-grade subclinical infection with field strains that can occur in puppies with a partial protective immune response, either via maternal immunity or acquired immunity, or shedding of vaccine virus in recently vaccinated puppies (Decaro et al., 2005a, Decaro et al., 2014, Grellet et al., 2014). The 31.7% prevalence of CCoV infections in this study was in line with that of earlier studies (Decaro et al., 2011, Stavisky et al., 2012). Genetic variability within canine enteric coronaviruses is due to naturally occurring recombination and mutation. Genotype CCoV-I and CCoV-II (with the subtypes CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb) have all been detected in dogs with diarrhoea (Stavisky et al., 2011, Decaro et al., 2013, Licitra et al., 2014). In our study no further genetic characterization was conducted. CCoV infection was associated significantly with severe clinical signs. Most of these puppies were however co-infected with CPV. Puppies that were co-infected with CCoV and CPV showed severe clinical signs, which was in concordance with previous reports of frequently occurring co-infections with these pathogens (Decaro et al., 2011, Castro et al., 2013). CPV and CCoV synergize in their pathogenicity by interacting at the gut wall level (Zicola et al., 2012). Also CPV induces suppression of the immune system which facilitates superinfection with other pathogens (Castro et al., 2013). CPV single infections have been shown to cause severe clinical signs (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012). Novel antigenic CPV variants (CPV-2a,CPV-2b,CPV-2c) are increasingly spread across the continent and have all been found in dogs with gastro-intestinal signs (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012). In this study antigenic typing of CPV was not conducted. In our study no association with severe clinical signs was found. However, since most of the CPV infected pups in our study were co-infected with CCoV, only a limited number of CPV single infected pups (n = 10) remained for statistical analysis. Shedding of CCoV in clinically healthy puppies was expected, this can be explained by prolonged shedding of this virus after previous subclinical or clinical infections (Pratelli et al., 2002). Although the presence of hEC was not significantly associated with diarrhoea, it was associated with severe clinical signs, regardless of coinfection with other pathogens. E. coli is part of the normal gut microbiome in dogs, making it difficult to differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains based on culture identification alone. In our study a classic virulence factor: the production of \u03b2-hemolysin, was used to detect virulent E. coli strains. \u03b2-hemolysis is a phenotypic indicator that can easily be screened for in routine bacterial culture. Star\u010di\u010d et al. (2002) found that hemolysin production in E. coli strains from dogs with diarrhoea was frequently combined with cytonecrotising toxin 1 and P fimbriae production. This was suggested to account for the pathogenicity of these types of strains (Star\u010di\u010d et al., 2002). Using \u03b2-hemolysis as a criterium for pathogenicity, the significant association of hEC with severe clinical signs provides clues for the possible role of this bacterium in causing acute diarrhoea in puppies. Additional characterization of these isolates towards toxigenic, adhesive, and necrotizing properties was not performed. The presence of Salmonella spp. in puppies was rare, as was expected (Stavisky et al., 2011, Marks et al., 2011, Dupont et al., 2013). Although clinical relevance could not be established, the zoonotic potential of this bacterium justifies monitoring for this pathogen. Campylobacter spp. is a common enteropathogen in humans, and is found in dogs as well. The 39.9% Campylobacter spp. prevalence found here is rather high compared to those determined in other studies and is, considering the zoonotic potential of this pathogen, worth further investigation (Parsons et al., 2010, Marks et al., 2011, Stavisky et al., 2011). The faecal shedding of C. difficile also appears to be high in puppies and is certainly much higher than that reported in earlier studies, but was not associated with acute diarrhoea (Koene et al., 2012, Wetterwik et al., 2013). The samples were not investigated for toxin presence given the low sensitivity of the assay (Chouicha and Marks, 2006). Isolates were tested for the presence of toxin A and B encoding genes and one isolate in the control group and one isolate in the diarrhoeic group was positive for toxin A and B encoding genes (data not shown). C. perfringens is part of the normal gut flora, therefore only shedding of large quantities of C. perfringens was considered positive in this study. In our study no significant association between the presence of C. perfringens and acute diarrhoea could be established. Regular deworming of puppies may have accounted for the relatively low prevalence and non-significant clinical impact of helminth infections and, depending on the product used, Giardia spp. or Cystoisospora spp. infections. The presence of Cystoisospora spp. in our puppies was not associated with diarrhoea, which was in concordance with the study of Dupont et al. (Dupont et al., 2013). Cyniclomyces guttulatus is prevalent in canine faeces, and its role as an opportunistic pathogen associated with chronic or reoccurring episodic diarrhoea has been described earlier (Mandigers et al., 2014). As no information about the role of this yeast in causing acute diarrhoea exists, this pathogen was incorporated in this study. In dogs with chronic diarrhoea a prevalence of 14% was reported earlier (Houwers and Blankenstein, 2001). A similar prevalence was found in our study but faecal presence of this yeast was not significantly associated with acute diarrhoea in puppies. In only 13.5% of the diarrheic puppies and 22.2% of asymptomatic puppies none of the pathogens searched for could be detected. Other causes for diarrhoea in these puppies could range from non-infectious causes (e.g. food hypersensitivity, food allergy, toxin ingestion etc.) to pathogens not included in our study (amongst others Canine Adenovirus, Norovirus, Astrovirus, Canine Distemper Virus, Brachyspira spp. Cryptosporidium spp.).",

(2014) included dogs of all ages suffering either from acute or chronic diarrhoea gathered from only one veterinary practice (Dupont et al., 2013, Gizzi et al., 2014, Grellet et al., 2014). In contrast to results of previous studies we found co-infections with multiple pathogens not only in the diseased but also in the healthy puppies emphasizing the need for developing a plan for first and second priority testing in infectious canine diarrhoea. Besides CPV and CCoV, hEC and Toxocara spp., CPV and Cystoisospora spp., and Giardia spp. and C. guttulatus were significantly more often found together. Puppies are considered more susceptible to Toxocara spp., Giardia spp. and Cystoisospora spp. compared to adult dogs. The co-occurrences found here are likely to reflect common risk exposures for the pathogens in question (Claerebout et al., 2009, Dupont et al., 2013).",

The high volume dog breeders in this study were denoted by the participating clinicians for having poor hygienic conditions and overcrowding. In our study high-volume breeders are linked to a higher risk for CPV and CCoV further supporting the association between these pathogens and breeder-size found by Grellet et al. and Licitra et al. (Grellet et al., 2014, Licitra et al., 2014). Moreover puppies originating from high-volume breeders were significantly (OR 3.60, p = 0.014) more likely to carry Cystoisospora spp. especially along with CPV as mentioned before. Other studies have also found a higher prevalence of Cystoisospora spp. in puppies obtained from pet shops and large breeding facilities. (Claerebout et al., 2009, Dupont et al., 2013, Grellet et al., 2014). Young animals are more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Apart from this, the moment of first exposure to an infectious disease in puppies will vary, and both criteria will determine the age at which puppies are first infected. Most of the CPV infections were found in puppies < 3 months of age. In the Netherlands puppies are generally vaccinated at 6, 9 and 12 weeks against CPV and most of the puppies in our study were vaccinated accordingly. Only 4 diarrhoeic puppies older than 3 months were CPV-positive, possibly due to either incomplete vaccination or inadequate vaccine-response due to high levels of maternal immunity. CCoV infection was not significantly different in puppies under and above 3 months of age. The role of CCoV is not unequivocal between studies, Schulz et al. (2008) found no significant association between CCoV infection and diarrhoea, in contrast to Stavisky et al. (Schulz et al., 2008, Stavisky et al., 2011). The use of different study populations and viral detection methods makes it difficult to compare the results of these studies. However, our study unequivocally shows a significant association with diarrhoea in puppies under the age of 1 year.",

Interestingly the four puppies that were hEC infected and severely diseased were under 9,5 weeks old, suggesting that there could be an age effect but this effect was not observed between the age categories used in our study. Previously seasonality for CPV was described with the predominant occurrence of CPV in summer months while others reported spring and early summer as the seasons with the highest occurrence of CPV (Houston et al., 1996, Bagshaw et al., 2014). The prevalence of CPV and CCoV positive puppies in our study varied by season, with CPV risk increasing in winter and spring compared to summer, and CCoV increasing in winter. Possible explanations for seasonality are variable, taking into consideration the moment of first exposure. Puppies from high volume breeders will most likely get exposed at the breeder and clinical symptoms will occur shortly after purchase. In these puppies the high environmental viral load due to overcrowding combined with a lower hygiene level in the colder winter months may prone these pups to more frequent infections.",

Risk factors for these infections are: Originating from high-volume dog breeders, exposure in winter and/or spring and puppies being <3 months of age. Besides CPV and CCoV, puppies originating from high-volume breeders are at increased risk of Cystoisospora spp., and may be examined accordingly. Routine screening for Toxocara spp., Giardia spp., Cyniclomyces guttulatus, Campylobacter spp. C. perfringens and C. difficile may lead to inconclusive results, especially in puppies that are regularly dewormed, and may be therefore be recommendable as second priority testing.",
