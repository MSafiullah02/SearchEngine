As of 3 March 2020, the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong (HK), Japan (JP) and Singapore (SG) were 101, 284, and 110; whereas the number of deaths were 2 (HK), 6 (JP) and 0 (SG) respectively. Human-to-human transmission clusters have been observed, including 16 cases originating from a Buddhist worship hall (HK); 28 cases linked to a couple returning from Hawaii (JP), and 31 cases related to a church gathering (SG).",

For k <1, it represents a greater degree of dispersion, hence more variability in transmission cluster sizes, such that SSEs may be more likely. We also investigated the relationship among R 0 , k and the probabilities of observing a cluster with size being at least the empirically maximum cluster size as of 3 March 2020 ( Figure   S1 ). We denote p n as the probability of observing a cluster p of size being at least n. For a fixed value of k, p 16 (HK), p 28 (JP) and p 31 (SG) all increased with R 0 . When R 0 is small (say 0.3), a higher variation in the number of secondary cases (that is, a smaller k) increases the chance of observing a large transmission cluster (suggestive of a SSE). This effect was reversed when R 0 >0.9. These two effects were consistent across the three populations. ",

Page 7 of 11 By fitting negative binomial models to these empirical cluster size distributions, the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of R 0 were determined, and found to be statistically smaller than one in all three populations: HK: R 0 = 0.61 (90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47,0.78); JP: R 0 = 0.48 (90% CI: 0.39, 0.59); SG: R 0 = 0.70 (90% CI: 0.55, 0.89) (Figure 1).

The estimates for p 16 (HK), p 28 (JP) and p 31 (SG) were 0.0155, 0.00111 and 0.00978, respectively (Figure 2). Furthermore, with an arbitrary introduction of 50 infections, the probabilities that at least one SSE will occur with a cluster size of 30 or greater are: 0.114 (HK), 0.0411 (JP) and 0.412 (SG) (Figure S2). By increasing the number of new infections to 250, this resulted in a substantial increase in the chance of observing at least one cluster with size 30 or greater: 0.455 (HK) 0.189 (JP) and 0.929 (SG) (Figure S2). By keeping the number of new infections unchanged and increasing the minimum cluster size from 30 to 120, the chances of observing one such SSE were smaller than 0.015 in all three populations (Figure S2). Page 8 of 11DISCUSSIONSSEs can change the nature of an epidemic, so it is useful for public health teams to determine if an ongoing outbreak has any contribution from them, which may be amenable to interventions. To make this assessment, we applied a previously published method [3] to publicly available data (the empirical transmission cluster sizes) of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in HK, JP and SG to estimate epidemiological parameters (R 0 , k). This assessment improves our understanding of the dispersion of clustered COVID-19 cases, but it does rely on a certain level of details when recording new cases and linking them to existing clusters.Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission in HK, JP and SG was not over-dispersed as of 3 March 2020 (with relatively large values of k), so there was no strong evidence for the presence of SSEs. Values of R 0 can impact on the degree of correlation between p n and k, making the prediction of the presence or absence of SSEs more variable. For R 0 , our estimates (0.48 -0.70) were much lower than those in China (2.20-2.68) [4, 5]. The observed smaller R 0 in HK, JP and SG may be due to the early enactment of social distancing interventions [6] or the high level of adoption of personal protective measures [7]. However, for given values of R 0, k and the final cluster size, increasing numbers of new infections increase the chance of observing clusters of epidemiologically-linked cases (Figure S2). We should therefore be cautious about the emergence of SSEs due to the increasing number of cases as COVID-19 progresses. Our results highlight the importance of social distancing to combat COVID-19. With the probability of observing secondary case clusters of size \u22654 ranging from 0.106 to 0.215 (Figure 2) and with a large proportion of households with size <4 (HK: 71%; JP: 60%; SG: 60%), there are transmission chains that extend beyond households into the community. Governments have Page 9 of 11 enacted different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). HK, SG and JP have avoided crowding (such as mandatory cancellation of mass gatherings), closed schools, conducted contact tracing and quarantined seemingly healthy individuals exposed to COVID-19 [6]. Both HK and SG enacted social distancing as soon as cases were first reported in the regions; while JP initiated these measures when the local cases reached 163 (excluding the international conveyance) in late February 2020 [6]. With possible transmission in the community, stay-athome order becomes a core social distancing measure, which confines SARS-CoV-2 within households at the expense of increased risk of infection among household members, particularly in the dense migrant dormitory in SG. Therefore, setting-wide wearing of face masks is recommended for cramped residential areas [8]. Besides the community, nosocomial outbreaks are possible as foretold by the past experience in SARS [1] and featured by the containment delay after hospitalization experienced by COVID-19 cases [9]. Therefore, heightened measures in isolating suspected inpatients should be enforced in hospitals.Combinations of interventions were effective in mitigating past pandemics [10], and they have been widely adopted to combat COVID-19 even the relative contributions of some individual measures is obscure. Therefore, determining the optimal set of NPIs remains a challenge. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases following the lifting of NPIs may prompt the emergence of SSEs, triggering a cascade of infections which are difficult to interrupt. To this end, further research is warranted to unravel predictors for SSEs, such as older age as observed in other diseases [1Empirical distribution of transmission cluster size and the best fitted curve from negative binomial models.",
