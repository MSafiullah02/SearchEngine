Treatment options for these patients range from observation to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but all patients are more susceptible to infection. The problem of infection is dynamic with continued shifts in pathogenic organisms and microbial susceptibilities, new treatment regimens that further diminish immune function, and patients receiving treatment who are now older and frailer. The classic patterns of immunode fi ciency for patients with a hematological malignancy include: periods of profound neutropenia, increased iatrogenic risks (i.e., central vascular catheters), and cellular immune suppression that affects HSCT recipients, patients with lymphoid malignancies, and those receiving treatment with corticosteroids or agents like alemtuzumab [1] [2] [3] [4] . Recent advances in antimicrobial drug development, new technology, clinical trial results, and further clinical experience have enhanced the database on which to make infection prophylaxis and treatment decisions. However, the practicing clinician must remember that the majority of basic infection management principles for patients who are neutropenic remain unchanged.",

            "text": "Standard evaluation and management principles for patients with fever and neutropenia are applicable to patients with a hematological malignancy, but risk strati fi cation beyond the patient's underlying disease is now a recommended starting point for patients who are neutropenic and develop fever [5] [6] [7] [8] . Neutropenia is primarily a consequence of the patients' underlying disease or treatment, although infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus [CMV] , human herpes virus [HHV]-6, HHV-8, parvovirus B19), medication toxicity (e.g., ganciclovir, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, linezolid), or graft rejection following HSCT are also important etiologies. Patients with neutropenia are immune compromised because of the absence of circulating neutrophils, plus the enhanced ability of the patient's endogenous colonizing fl ora to invade disrupted mucosal and skin barriers and cause infection [ 1, 2, marrow recovery, inadequate antitumor responses, or a relapse of their disease [ 1, 2 ] . The primary sites of infection are limited and include the alimentary tract (i.e., mouth, pharynx, esophagus, large and small bowel, and rectum), sinuses, lungs, and skin. Febrile episodes that occur during periods of neutropenia should be considered infection, but depending on the clinical study more than 40-80 % of such febrile episodes will not have an infecting pathogen identi fi ed [ 1, 2, [11] [12] [13] . Bacterial pathogens are responsible for more than 90 % of the \" fi rst\" neutropenia-associated infections, but there has been substantial evolution in the spectrum of bacterial bloodstream isolates recovered from these patients over the past 30 years [ 14, 15 ] . Herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and the respiratory viruses (e.g., in fl uenza A and B, parain fl uenza, and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] ) may also be important initial pathogens or co-pathogens (Table 52 .1 ). Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, yeast, and molds are less frequent \"initial pathogens,\" but are the primary cause of the \"second or subsequent\" infections [ 12, 16 ] . Initial bacterial pathogens are frequently gram-positive cocci, and despite a decreased virulence of these pathogens, there is still signi fi cant attributable mortality with such infections [ 2, [11] [12] [13] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Attributable mortality with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bloodstream infections has been reported to be 13.6 % (95 % CI 4.2-22.9 %) and increases to 37.1 % (95 % CI 10-64 %) for bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) [24] [25] [26] . Colonization with VRE is a prerequisite for infection and increases the patient's risk of developing a VRE bloodstream infection, and death following allogeneic transplantation [ 27 ] . The incidence of BSI with viridans streptococci for some oncology centers has been signi fi cant, and 10 % of such viridans streptococcal infections will be associated with a \"toxic-shock\"-like syndrome that can be rapidly fatal despite appropriate antibiotics [20] [21] [22] .",

Antibiotic resistance remains most frequent among the gram-positive pathogens, speci fi cally coagulase-negative staphylococci. Transplant recipients and patients with hematological malignancies at the Medical College of Wisconsin in the calendar year 2009 experienced 187 BSI, a rate of 0.289 bloodstream infections/100 patient-days (Table 52. 2 ). Seventy-two percent of these infections occurred during periods of neutropenia, and more than half were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. The antibiotic resistance patterns for gram-positive cocci continue to show increasing levels of resistance to beta-lactam and fl uoroquinolone antibiotics (Table 52. 3 ). Pathogens responsible for the \"second or subsequent infections\" include antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi. Wingard et al. reported that S. epidermidis (coagulase-negative staphylococci) were responsible for up to 50 % of these \"second or subsequent infections\" [ 16 ] . The incidence of coagulase-negative staphylococcus infections at this institution was likely due to the frequent use of fl uoroquinolone agents as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen. Antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli composed an additional 10 %, and the remaining pathogens were fungal. Subsequent infections with the exception of coagulase-negative staphylococci are dif fi cult to diagnose, more resistant to treatment, and associated with the highest rates of morbidity and mortality [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

Hand soap that contains chlorhexidine is recommended, and adds residual antimicrobial effect to the mechanical cleansing that occurs with the physical washing. Antimicrobial hand rubs can be used if soap, water, and sinks are not easily accessible. Alcohol-containing waterless products appear to be well tolerated and effective, but antimicrobial resistance among C. dif fi cile has been reported [ 39 ] . Gloves when worn should be put on after entering a patient's room and the hand washing is complete. Gloves should never be used for more than one patient contact. Keeping staff and patient visitors who have respiratory symptoms (e.g., uncontrolled cough and respiratory secretions, conjunctivitis, systemic symptoms) from contact with high-risk patients may decrease the risk of patients acquiring a serious respiratory viral infection. One must remember in constructing isolation approaches that the modes of transmission of respiratory virus infections are both respiratory and direct patient contact. Annual vaccination of healthcare workers against viral in fl uenza is important and strongly recommended.",

The potential for bacterial resistance to fl uoroquinolone-based chemoprophylaxis remains a substantial concern [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] , and individual cancer centers have reported rising rates of resistance with the use of fl uoroquinolones [ 58, 59, 61, 65 ] . High utilization of fl uoroquinolones in oncology patients has been linked to increases in infections due to fl uoroquinolone-resistant grampositive cocci, and E. coli and C. dif fi cile enterocolitis, but recent meta-analyses could not con fi rm this later association [ 47, 58, 61, 66, 67 ] .

Wald et al. in their study of 2,496 consecutive HSCT patients reported that only 2 % of patients became colonized with Aspergillus after transplant, and only 21 % of patients who developed invasive aspergillosis had colonization detected prior to infection [ 33 ] . However, when Aspergillus colonization was identi fi ed, it was highly associated with the development of invasive infection (60 % positive predictive value), and this risk increased further (94 % positive predictive value) when HSCT patients were neutropenic [ 33 ] .",

At least two sets of blood cultures should be drawn, where a \"set\" consists of 20 ml of blood divided into both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles. Retrospective studies have reported that two blood culture sets detect 80-90 % of bloodstream pathogens, while three or more sets are required to achieve greater than 96 % detection [ 104 ] . In the neutropenic cancer patient, collection of blood culture sets from all central venous catheter (CVC) lumens (if present) and peripheral vein has been recommended [ 11, 13, 106 ] . Yet, some experts question the importance of the additional peripheral vein blood culture, and believe that sets of blood cultures that only drawn from CVC comprise an adequate evaluation [ 13 ] . This latter recommendation which avoids culturing of peripheral blood remains controversial, and it does not provide the blood specimen necessary to help de fi ne the role of the CVC in the bloodstream infection [ 107 ] . However, it does eliminate the routine need for peripheral venipuncture, and it decreases patient discomfort and cost. Additional sets of blood cultures may be obtained on each of the next 2 days if fever persists after empiric antibiotics have been started. Blood cultures drawn beyond the initial febrile period should only be obtained based on changes in the patient's clinical status and not just persistent fever. Recrudescent fever after the initial fever has completely resolved in a different clinical entity, and often signals a new episode of infection that requires a clinical evaluation plus additional blood cultures.",

These specimens should be tested for the presence of adenovirus, in fl uenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and parain fl uenza. Patients with respiratory signs and symptoms should have a chest radiograph performed to rule out pneumonia. Pneumonia during neutropenia can progress rapidly to respiratory compromise, and therefore should initially be managed in the hospital. The serial determination of the patient's resting oxygen saturation can also be helpful. CT scans of the head, sinuses, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed as clinically indicated. Laboratory studies including complete blood cell counts and determination of the levels of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen are needed to plan empiric antibiotic therapy, and to monitor for the possible occurrence of drug toxicity.

Hemodynamic instability 2. Oral or GI mucositis that interferes with swallowing or causes severe diarrhea 3. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, or diarrhea 4.

Evidence of hepatic insuf fi ciency (de fi ned as aminotransferase values greater than 5\u00d7 normal values) or renal insuf fi ciency (de fi ned as a creatinine clearance of less than 20 ml/min). Duration of neutropenia was not initially included as a criterion for risk in the MASCC assessment scheme, but this is clearly an important factor [ 118 ] . Patients in whom prolonged neutropenia is expected as a consequence of HSCT preparation or induction chemotherapy for AML are almost always judged to be \"high-risk\". Patients undergoing autologous HSCT or consolidation therapy for leukemia may also experience prolonged neutropenia, but because of the other factors included in the MASCC risk assessment scheme they maybe scored as \"low-risk.\" Finally, a review of the MASCC criteria applied to a large population at one U.S. cancer centers found that the MASCC tool will consistently identify patients with minimal medical co-morbidity short durations of neutropenia ( \u00a3 7 days) and solid tumors receiving conventional outpatient chemotherapy as \"low-risk\" [ 114 ] .",

In recent years, antibioticresistant pathogens have become more common, and now pose a signi fi cant new challenge for neutropenic and other hospitalized patients [120] [121] [122] . Routine empiric coverage of all bacteria is not possible, and therefore the aim should be to provide empiric coverage for the most common and the most virulent pathogens. This may be accomplished with a variety of antibiotic regimens, but the ultimate selection of a particular empiric antibiotic regimen should continue to be based on the risk status of the patient (high vs. low-risk), localizing signs or symptoms of infection such as pneumonia, enteritis, or cellulitis, and the local institution and individual patient patterns of bacterial resistance and colonization.",

Persistent fever alone, in an otherwise stable patient, is rarely an indication to alter the empiric antibiotic regimen. Rather speci fi c antimicrobial additions or changes to the empiric regimen should be guided by clinical changes and or diagnostic culture results. Broader decisions about when and how to modify antimicrobial coverage during the course of neutropenia should be based on the patient's risk category (low or high), the source of fever in documented infections, and the clinical judgment about whether the patient is responding to the initial regimen.

Most uncomplicated bacterial bloodstream and soft tissue infections require 10-14 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy, while bacterial sinusitis and pneumonia require 3-4 weeks of therapy to effectively control these infections [ 11, 13, [152] [153] [154] [155] . More prolonged antimicrobial treatment is often required if the causative pathogen is P. aeruginosa or a mold, and antibiotics for these latter infections often must be extended beyond resolution of fever and neutropenia. Pneumonia in patients with neutropenia should generally be treated as a healthcare-acquired infection according to the recent guidelines from the American Thoracic Society [ 156 ] . Patients with pneumonia who are neutropenic should be considered to be at high-risk for infections with multidrug-resistant pathogens, and initial broad-spectrum treatment with combinations of a b -lactam or carbapenem plus an aminoglycoside or antipseudomonal fl uoroquinolone is recommended. The empiric addition of vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin is appropriate for severe cases of pneumonia as de fi ned by hypoxia, extensive in fi ltrates, or suspicion of MRSA as the etiological pathogen. Initiation of inadequate or limited antibiotic regimens for healthcare-associated pneumonia is a major risk factor for excess mortality, prolonged hospital length of stay and must be avoided [ 151 ] .

Oral ulcerations or symptoms of esophagitis may represent herpes simplex or Candida esophagitis in high-risk patients, so empiric additions of acyclovir and/or fl uconazole or other antifungal agents are appropriate. The onset of severe abdominal pain, typically in the right lower quadrant, suggests neutropenic enterocolitis (also referred to as \"typhlitis\"). A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be obtained for additional evaluation [ 157, 158 ] . Since anaerobes and gram-negative organisms predominate in causing neutropenic enterocolitis, monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem, or a combination of an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin plus metronidazole, are appropriate antibiotic regimens. There is less evidence for routine additions of vancomycin or an antifungal agent, but should be considered if the patient is hemodynamically unstable [ 11, 13 ] .

However, immediate catheter removal is recommended for those patients with BSI caused by fungi, nontuberculosis mycobacterium ( M. fortuitum complex and M. chelonae /abscessus group), and VRE because of the consistent lack of infection response until this device is discontinued [ 11, 13, 159 ] . Persistent BSI are also more frequent if the catheter is not removed when the bloodstream pathogen is a Bacillus sp., C. jeikeium , S. aureus , P. aeruginosa , or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [ 11, 13, 159 ] . Most other BSI can initially be treated with pathogen-speci fi c antibiotics, but catheter removal should be considered when the BSI persists beyond 48 h and no other site of infection is identi fi ed. One additional caveat is that the CVC should be considered a potential site of infection for those bacteremias that recur shortly after completing a course of antibiotics [ 159 ] .",

Quantitative blood cultures have also been recommended in the past, but they are not routinely recommended because of their cost and limited clinical utility [ 159 ] . The premise of the DPT test is that if the catheter is the source of the BSI then the concentration of organisms in the catheter will be higher than in the peripheral blood, and blood cultures drawn from the CVC will become positive more quickly. Studies suggest that a CVC blood culture that becomes positive at least 120 min earlier than a simultaneously drawn peripheral vein blood indicates the catheter to be the likely source of infection [ 165 ] .

In general, for organisms other than coagulase-negative staphylococci, a 14-day course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is adequate in a patient with neutropenia assuming the patient responds to antimicrobial therapy within 48-72 h, and the CRBSI is not complicated by a deep tissue infection.

CRBSI from any pathogen that is complicated by disseminated or deep infection requires at least 4-6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy [ 11, 13, 159 ] .",

The lack of response maybe the result of a pathogen being resistant to the empiric antimicrobial regimen; inadequate serum or tissue levels of the antibiotics; infection at a vascular site (e.g., catheter) or closed space; the emergence of a second infection; or an unusually slow clinical response. Resolutions of fever in patients who are neutropenic are often delayed. Elting et al. reviewed 488 episodes of fever and neutropenia. The median time to fever resolution ranged from 5 to 7 days, and less than 40 % of patients became afebrile before day 5 of therapy [ 168 ] . Patients with gram-negative BSI were febrile longer (mean, 6.6-8.2 days), and the time to fever defervescence was even longer for patients with gram-positive BSI (mean, 6.6-12.4 days). These results are consistent with the fi ndings published by Freifeld et al. who reported that fever persisted a mean of 4 days with ceftazidime therapy, and 3 days when patients were treated with imipenem [ 169 ] . Thus, fevers maybe prolonged even when patient is clinically improved, but fever response varies depending upon the speci fi c antibiotic regimen, the site of infection, and the infecting pathogen.",

At greatest risk are those patients treated for acute myelogenous leukemia for which the incidence of invasive mold infections is 20 times more frequent than what is reported for patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma [ 175 ] . Clinical manifestations of occult fungal infection are nonspeci fi c, and because diagnosis of invasive fungal infections is especially dif fi cult, empiric antifungal therapy instituted for persistent neutropenic fever has been the standard approach for several decades [ 1, 2, 171 ] . Using these very broad and nonspeci fi c criteria, approximately 22-34 % of neutropenic cancer patients may receive antifungal treatment, but only about 4 % of such patients will ever have an invasive fungal infection identi fi ed [176] [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] . The choice of empiric antifungal agent must consider not only the most likely fungal pathogens, but also toxicities of the therapy and cost. If antifungal prophylaxis has not been given, then an invasive candida infection is the most likely explanation. For patients receiving fl uconazole prophylaxis, fl uconazole-resistant candida infections, such as C. krusei or C. glabrata , or an invasive mold infection, are the most common pathogens.",

Maertens et al. used serial serum galactomannan tests and early CT scanning combined with a preemptive treatment algorithm [ 193 ] . The preemptive treatment approach resulted in a decrease in the need for empiric antifungal treatment from 35 % vs. 8 %, and overall patient survival was similar to that reported with empiric antifungal therapy. More recently, Cordonnier et al. performed a randomized trial that suggests that preemptive antifungal therapy may be potentially a safe alternative to empiric antifungal therapy, for a select group of high-risk neutropenic patients that does not include allogeneic transplant recipients [ 194 ] . Preemptive therapy in this trial was initiated for clinical symptoms, a chest CT scan that suggested an invasive fungal infection, and/or mycological evidence such as Aspergillus colonization or a positive galactomannan test. Overall survival was similar for both treatment groups, but there were more episodes of invasive fungal infections and a trend toward more fungal-related deaths in those patients treated with preemptive therapy. Finally, Hebart and colleagues compared empiric antifungal therapy versus PCR-driven preemptive antifungal therapy in patients receiving anti-yeast prophylaxis after allogeneic stem cell transplant [ 195 ] . This study demonstrated an increased use of antifungal therapy, and a reduced 30-day mortality in the PCR-driven arm, but no differences were reported in the incidence of invasive fungal infections or 100-day survival.",

These include the optimal trigger for treatment (clinical or radiological manifestations versus a serum biomarker), which biomarker should be used (antigen or PCR test), timing (early before clinical manifestations or late after clinical manifestations), and which antibiotics provide the most appropriate spectrum of antifungal activity [196] [197] [198] [199] . Another important unresolved question is the safety of using preemptive antifungal treatment in patients who are already receiving anti-mold prophylaxis.

Candida spp. are endogenous pathogens to many patients with a hematological malignancy or may be acquired from a wide range of exogenous sources. Mold infections are primarily acquired by the inhalation of aerosolized spores, but additional studies have documented the importance of aerosolized contaminated water sources [ 202 ] . The diagnosis of candidiasis and mold infections continues to rely on the recovery of a speci fi c pathogen from cultures of the blood, or identi fi cation by culture or histology from tissue samples. Rapid diagnosis of these infections using serum antigen detection as a surrogate marker for invasive disease remains a high priority, but as noted previously this goal has not yet been met [203] [204] [205] . Despite recent advances, aspergillosis remains the primary cause of infection-associated death after allogeneic transplantation and induction therapy for acute leukemia (Table 52 .6 ).",

The incidence of candidiasis has been well documented both before and after the routine use of azole antifungal prophylaxis [ 37 ] . Viscoli and coworkers reported the occurrence of candidemia in cancer patients [ 206 ] . The overall 30-day mortality rate for infected patients was 39 %, and the factors of increased age and stage of disease, the occurrence of septic shock, and the lack of antifungal prophylaxis were associated with an increase in infection-associated death [ 206 ] . C. albicans was the most common species identi fi ed, but the recovery of nonalbicans species was increased in patients with a hematological malignancy who had received azole prophylaxis. Goodrich and colleagues reported that invasive candida infections occurred in 14 % of transplant recipients before fl uconazole prophylaxis was routinely being used. C. albicans (62 %) and C. tropicalis (21 %) were the most commonly isolated species, the median time to the development of a Candida spp. BSI was 15 days after transplantation, and these infections had an attributable mortality of 39 % that increased to 88 % when patients had documented Candida tissue invasion [ 70 ] . The incidence of invasive candida infections following the introduction of fl uconazole prophylaxis decreased to 4.7 %. Infections occurred later after transplant (median of 28 days after transplantation), and they were associated with a slightly lower (20 %) mortality rate [ 37 ] . Nonalbicans Candida species were more likely to be isolated with C. glabrata , and C. krusei being most common. C. albicans resistance to fl uconazole was modest and identi fi ed among 5.3 % of C. albicans isolates [ 37 ] . Treatment of invasive candida infections has evolved with the introduction of new classes of antifungal therapy [ 207, 208 ] . Unfortunately, there are no randomized controlled trials of treatment of candidemia in patients with neutropenia, and thus most treatment recommendations are derived from small single-arm studies or subsets of larger randomized trials. Most new antifungal agents are reported to provide success response rates of 55-65 %, but the clinical outcome of these infections is highly dependent on neutrophil recovery [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] [214] . The IDSA now recommend that an echinocandidin (e.g., caspofungin, anidulafungin, or micafungin) or lipid formulation of amphotericin B be utilized as a fi rst-line therapy for most invasive candida infections [ 207 ] . Duration of therapy is dependent on the patient's disease and neutrophil recovery, but minimum therapy for uncomplicated infections is 2 weeks after documented clearance of candida from the blood and resolution of infection-associated symptoms [11] [12] [13] 215 ] .",

The pathophysiological conditions and periods that de fi ne these infections begin with neutropenia during the preengraftment period (Table 52 .6 ). The second period of infection spans day 40-120 posttransplantation when patients suffer from a cellular immune defect induced primarily by acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and/or the immunosuppressant therapy needed to control GVHD. The third period of aspergillus infection occurs late after transplantation and these infections are correlated with late-CMV disease and chronic GVHD. These later entities are surrogate markers of delayed immune reconstitution after transplantation. Mortality with invasive aspergillus after transplantation has historically been very high, ranging from 60 to 88 %, and similar for all three-infection periods [ 1, 2, [33] [34] [35] [36] . Clinical characteristics and outcomes of aspergillus infections among patients with a hematological malignancy treated with conventional therapy are similar to HSCT recipients [ 35 ] . Pulmonary involvement is seen in most cases (87 %), infection of the sinuses/nose occurs in 16 % of cases, and dissemination to the brain occurs in 8 % of infected patients [ 35, 216, 217 ] . Mortality has also been very high (64 %) for this patient population, although slightly lower death rates have been reported for patients with AML who experience resolution of their neutropenia (30-40 %) [ 1, 2, 217 ] .",

What is the optimal antifungal treatment for clinical infections without a documented fungal pathogen? 2. What is the role for combinations of antifungal antibiotics? 3. Is amphotericin-B still the treatment of choice for zygomycetes infections? 4. Can azole antifungal agents with anti-mold activity be used safely when administered concomitantly with immunosuppressant agents including tacrolimus and sirolimus. A new fever coupled with a pulmonary nodule or in fi ltrate that develops during antibiotic treatment of fever and neutro-penia is suggestive of a mold infection. Aspergillus is by far the most common mold, but other molds including zygomycetes (mucor/rhizopus and others resistant to voriconazole), fusarium, and pseudoallescheria/scedosporium must be considered. The clinical presentations of these different molds are quite similar, and one factor that has been identi fi ed as a risk factor for zygomycosis is voriconazole prophylaxis or treatment. Most experts believe that empiric treatment that is to be directed primarily against aspergillosis should consist of voriconazole [ 222, 223 ] . Voriconazole has a much lower toxicity pro fi le than amphotericin B products, and unlike posaconazole is available in both an oral and IV formulation. Unfortunately, voriconazole lacks antimicrobial activity against zygomycosis and for patients already receiving voriconazole the clinician must then consider the need for empiric coverage of zygomycetes [233] [234] [235] . The decision to prescribe treatment directed against zygomycosis has in the past relied exclusively on an amphotericin B products, but posaconazole maybe now a more attractive treatment alternative for such infections [ 235, 236 ] .",

Invasive mold infections may progress quickly during periods of neutropenia, and thus despite the lack of de fi nitive prospective data the concept of empiric combination antifungal therapy has become clinically attractive but remains controversial [237] [238] [239] . Evidence from animal studies of invasive aspergillosis suggests that the combination of an azole and echinocandin is superior to treatment with an azole alone. Retrospective clinical studies in humans also provide some additional support for combination therapy [237] [238] [239] . The primary arguments against combination therapy rest with concern about toxicity and cost. Despite these issues many experts frequently will prescribe initial treatment with voriconazole plus caspofungin, or liposomal amphotericin B and caspofungin [ 240 ] . Combination of agents from all three classes (an azole, amphotericin B, and echinocandin) of antifungal therapy could be combined, but there are animal model and laboratory data that suggest potential antagonism when such combinations are utilized. To date there are no clinical data that support or refute such combination treatment.",

There is ample evidence showing inter-individual variability when oral voriconazole dosing is utilized, and this has resulted in the recommendation that voriconazole or posaconazole serum levels be monitored in patients whose infections appears to be failing to respond. However, clinical availability of voriconazole and posaconazole serum levels in many centers is limited, and thus some experts just increase the administered daily voriconazole or posaconazole dose, or switch to IV voriconazole therapy when there is concern about a patient's clinical response or a patient's absorption of oral medications is questioned.",

Antibiotics have improved and in general are less toxic than their ancestors. Progress has been made in the area of prophylaxis of Candida albicans infections and potentially aspergillosis. Yet, patients now are at an increased risk of nonalbicans yeast infections and the mortality from mold infections (e.g., aspergillus, zygomycetes) remains signi fi cant. The promise of new diagnostic techniques, additional antimicrobial agents, and strategies for treatment and prophylaxis of \"high-risk\" patients with hematological malignancy holds the potential that cancer treatment for such patients may be safer in the future. It is critical for the oncology team to remember that infections are a dynamic process and change is guaranteed. Physicians who manage patients with a hematological malignancy must not forget the value and importance of standard infection control measures. However, it will be a challenge to maintain such infection control approaches as the care of these patients continues to be transferred to an ambulatory/ day hospital facility.",

Urine: Culture of urine samples is indicated if signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection exist, a urinary catheter is in place, or the urinalysis is abnormal. 3. CSF: Examination and culture of spinal fl uid is indicated only if meningitis is suspected. Platelet transfusion should be given prior to lumbar puncture if thrombocytopenia is present. 4. Skin: Aspiration or biopsy of skin lesions suspected of being infected should be performed and submitted for histological testing, gram staining, and culture[ 108 ] .",
