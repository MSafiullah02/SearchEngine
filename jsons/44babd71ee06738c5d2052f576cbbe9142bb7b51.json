As typically used, however, this tool may introduce an inconsistency by assuming that the rate of depletion of a compartment is proportional to the content of that compartment. As mentioned in the seminal SIR work of Kermack and McKendrick, this is an assumption of mathematical convenience rather than realism. As such, it leads to underprediction of the infectious compartment peaks by a factor of about two, a problem of particular importance when dealing with availability of resources during an epidemic. To remedy this problem, we develop the dSIR model structure, comprising a single delay differential equation and associated delay algebraic equations. We show that SIR and dSIR fully agree in assessing stability and long-term values of a population through an epidemic, but differ considerably in the exponential rates of ascent and descent as well as peak values during the epidemic. The novel Pad\u00e9-SIR structure is also introduced as a approximation of dSIR by ordinary differential equations. We rigorously analyze the properties of these models and present a number of illustrative simulations, particularly in view of the recent coronavirus epidemic. Suggestions for further study are made. : medRxiv preprint medR\u03c7iv.org Michael Nikolaou 2 taken to curb an epidemic, such a change could easily be reflected in the SIR model by a time-varying (cf. in eqns.",

Propagation of an individual from S to I to R underlies the basic context of the exercise. In a modeling tour-de-force, the authors eventually present, in equations (11) through (15) of their paper (ibid.), the general structure of the elaborate mathematical model they derive. They proceed to examine the implications of their model for special cases, and finally present a very special case resulting in a set of three relatively simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs, equations (29) ibid.), which were destined to form the basis for a genre of mathematical models in epidemiology, the celebrated SIR model and its many variants. 3 The three ODEs are",

It is also noted that even if the SIR model parameters and are estimated based on experimental data fit -albeit under the wrong interpretationmodel predictions are still going to be inaccurate. This is because the standard SIR model, comprising the three ODEs in eqns. (1)-(3), is structurally different from the DDE form of the dSIR model, eqns. (7)-(9), or even from the ODE form of the Pad\u00e9-based approximation of the dSIR model DDEs, eqns.",
