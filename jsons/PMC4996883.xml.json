Such research, when conducted by responsible scientists, usually aims to improve understanding of disease causing agents, their interaction with human hosts, and/or their potential to cause pandemics. The ultimate objective of such research is to better inform public health and preparedness efforts and/or development of medical countermeasures. Despite these important potential benefits, GOF research (GOFR) can pose risks regarding biosecurity and biosafety. GOFR is a subset of \u201cdual-use research\u201d\u2014i.e., research that can be used for both beneficial and malevolent purposes. Whereas the dual-use life science research debate has largely focused on biosecurity dangers associated with potential malevolent use of research, the GOFR debate has more explicitly focused on risks involving both biosecurity and biosafety\u2014the point being that creation of especially dangerous pathogens might pose highly significant biosafety risks that are independent of, and perhaps more feasible to measure/assess than, risks associated with malevolent use.",

This pause applies specifically to experiments that \u201cmay be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes \u2026 such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route\u201d (White House 2014).

As part of this deliberative process, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) commissioned this Ethical Analysis White Paper providing:Review and summary of ethical literature on GOFR;Identification and analysis of existing ethical and decision-making frameworks relevant to (i) the evaluation of risks and benefits of GOFR, (ii) decision-making about the conduct of GOF studies, and (iii) the development of US policy regarding GOFR (especially with respect to funding of GOFR); andDevelopment of an ethical and decision-making framework that may be considered by NSABB when analyzing information provided by GOFR risk-benefit assessment, and when crafting its final recommendations (especially regarding GOFR funding policy decisions in particular).\n",

Conversely, the more important/beneficial a GOFR study is expected to be, the more we should be willing to accept potentially unmanageable risks.\nJustice Because justice requires fair sharing of benefits and burdens, the ethical acceptability of GOFR partly depends on the degree to which (1) risks fall on some people more than others, (2) risks fall on those who are unlikely to benefit, and/or (3) any resulting harms are uncompensated.\nGood Governance\u2014Democracy GOFR decision- and policy-making should (insofar as possible) reflect the ultimate values, value weightings, and risk-taking strategies of public citizens.\nEvidence Decision- and policy-making regarding GOFR should be based on more/better evidence regarding risks, benefits, (means of) risk minimization, who is likely to benefit or be harmed by research, and the values, value weightings, and risk-taking strategies of public citizens.\nInternational Outlook and Engagement Because risks and benefits of GOFR (can) affect the global community at large, the ethical acceptability of GOFR partly depends on the extent to which it is accepted internationally. Decision- and policy-making regarding GOFR should (insofar as possible) involve consultation, negotiation, coordination, and related forms of active engagement with other countries.\n",

Rather than drawing a sharp bright line between GOFR studies that are ethically acceptable and those that are ethically unacceptable, this framework is designed to indicate where any given study would fall on an ethical spectrum\u2014where imaginable cases of GOFR might range from those that are most ethically acceptable (perhaps even ethically praiseworthy or ethically obligatory) (i.e., those that fare best with respect to all 8 dimensions), at one end of the spectrum, to those that are most ethically problematic or unacceptable (i.e., those that fare worst regarding all 8 dimensions, and thus clearly should not be funded/conducted), at the other.

This research addressed an important scientific question\u2014i.e., Might it be possible for H5N1 to naturally evolve into a human-to-human transmissible strain and thus result in a pandemic?\u2014and (purportedly) yielded an affirmative answer. After the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) initially recommended that these studies should be published in a redacted form (i.e., including key findings, while omitting detailed description of materials and methods), it later approved publication of revised versions in full, and the papers were published in 2012. Advocates of these studies/publications argued that they would improve surveillance of H5N1 in nature (facilitating early identification of, and thus better response to, the emergence of potential pandemic strains) and facilitate development of vaccines that might be needed to protect against pandemic strains of the virus. Critics questioned the validity of claims about such benefits and argued that the studies might facilitate creation of biological weapons agents that could kill millions, or possibly even billions, of people.",

In light of the ferret H5N1 research controversy, furthermore, influenza researchers imposed a voluntary moratorium on GOF studies from January 2012 to February 2013; and the US Government developed/adopted policy regarding the funding of GOF H5N1 studies in 2013 (Department of Health and Human Services 2013).",

            "text": "One clear consensus in (ethically relevant) literature addressing GOFR is that there is need for broader community engagement/consultation and more transparent decision- and policy-making (Duprex et al. 2015; Evans et al. 2015; Fauci 2012; Imperiale and Casadevall 2015; Lipsitch and Galvani 2014; Lipsitch and Inglesby 2014; Pfeiffer 2015; Suk et al. 2014). Part of the concern here, hopefully to be addressed by the deliberative process initiated by the US Government, is the perception (at least in the eyes of some) that much of the relevant debate and/or decision-making to date has been dominated by a limited subset of the scientific community and/or by people or parties with potential conflicts of interest. Because the potential risks and benefits of GOFR affect the public at large, it has been argued that more public input to debate and decision-making is necessary\u2014the idea being that it is ethically problematic for some (e.g., scientists) to be making decisions and taking actions that impose serious risks on others (i.e., members of the general public) without consent of, or adequate input from, the latter. Furthermore, because the consequences of GOFR are ultimately global in nature (i.e., GOFR conducted in one country can have risks and benefits for those living in other countries), many have emphasized the importance of greater international engagement, which is necessary to promote harmonization of GOFR governance. While it is widely accepted that expert scientific opinion is essential to well-informed GOFR decision- and policy-making, there have been calls for input from a wider range of scientific disciplines. Jonathan Suk and colleagues (2014), for example, argue that greater engagement with public health experts would facilitate both (1) assessment of GOFR risks and benefits and (2) design of GOFR studies that would have better translation into public health policy and practice. Many of these points are captured by the following statement of David Relman:Woefully insufficient input has been obtained from a wide variety of scientists and from many other stakeholders among the general public. It is unethical to place so many members of the public at risk and then consult only scientists\u2014or, even worse, just a small subset of scientists\u2014and exclude others from the decision-making and oversight process \u2026 In many cases, conversations have only involved infectious-disease researchers and conflicts of interests among participants have not been adequately acknowledged or addressed \u2026 It is our responsibility as scientists to explain the rationale behind our work, including its benefits and risks, to the general public in terms that are accessible to those with an average level of education, rather than to be dismissive. This is especially important when the work has important consequences for the whole of society (Relman in Duprex et al. 2015, pp. 61\u201363).\n",

As summarized by Daniel Rozell (2015, p. 1), however, early attempts at quantitative GOFR risk assessment have lead to widely divergent estimations:Using biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) lab infection data, Lipsitch and Inglesby [2014] estimated a probability of between 0.01 % and 0.1 % per laboratory-year of creating a pandemic which would cause between 2 million and 1.4 billion fatalities. This yields an expected fatality rate of 2000 to 1.4 million per BSL-3 laboratory-year. Alternatively, using data from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the probability of a pandemic would be between 0.05 % and 0.6 % per worker-year, with a resulting expected fatality rate of between 10,000 and 10 million per laboratory worker \u2026 A subsequent risk estimate from Fouchier [2015] started from the same data, but then Fouchier argued that [given special safety precautions taken in his H5N1 GOFR] a lab-induced pandemic would occur every 33 billion years\u2014more than twice the known age of the universe.\n",

Purported benefits of publication were that this would facilitate (1) development/production of vaccines against pandemic strains of the virus and (2) surveillance enabling early identification of, and thus response to, pandemic strains that might occur naturally. Critics have argued that such benefits are limited, inter alia, because naturally occurring pandemic strains may turn out be different from those created via the studies in question (in which case production of vaccines for, or surveillance targeting of, the latter might not be very useful); international surveillance systems are too weak \u201cto detect a pandemic viral sequence \u2026 before it is too late\u201d (Lipsitch and Galvani 2014, p. 3); \u201can important lesson learnt from pandemic H1N1 (swine flu) is that there is not much that can be done to contain outbreaks of pandemic strains of influenza once they emerge\u201d (i.e., so early identification via surveillance might not make much difference) (Selgelid 2013, p. 148); and, given the way the vaccine industry actually works, there is unlikely to be development/stockpiling of vaccines against naturally-occurring transmissible strains of influenza before such strains actually arise (Selgelid 2013).",

A widely acknowledged limitation of RBA is that confidence in predictions generated depends upon the quality of (1) input data and (2) models employed in assessment of risks and benefits.3 Both data and models will inevitably be imperfect in the context of GOFR in light of scenario complexity, uncertainties, unknown unknowns, and presumably unknowable unknowns, that are relevant to GOFR consequences. The likelihood and magnitude of harms that could result from GOFR, for example, partly depend upon the actions of malevolent actors. There are innumerable possible actions that such actors might take, however\u2014and the likelihood of any given action and/or the consequences thereof (given all the relevant factors involved) are arguably inestimable (Posner 2004). In some cases the commissioned RBA will aim to provide qualitative rather than quantitative analysis\u2014precisely because the latter will not always be feasible. At the September 2015 meeting of the NSABB, Rocco Casagrande (Managing Director of Gryphon Scientific, which has been commissioned to complete the RBA currently underway) explained that assessment of potential benefits of GOFR (e.g., regarding countermeasure development) will be qualitative rather than quantitative because there is inadequate data for the latter (Casagrande 2015).4\n",

There may be reasonable disagreement, for example, about whether the gain of scientific knowledge is merely instrumentally valuable, or also valuable for its own sake (Kitcher 2001; Evans 2014a). Similar things might be said about the value of security, which looms large in debates about GOF research. Policy debates about dual use research more generally have often been framed in terms of potential conflict, and/or the need to strike a balance, between the value of security, on the one hand, and the value of scientific progress, and the good things thereby enabled, on the other. In its Framework for Conducting Risk and Benefit of Gain-of-Function Research NSABB (2015) has recommended that the RBA contractor consider the security implications of the kinds of risks and benefits enumerated above. Conceived as the \u201cprotection of valuable things against loss\u201d (Selgelid 2012), security can be considered a meta-value. Protection of valuable things against loss can include both protection of instrumentally valuable things against loss and protection of intrinsically valuable things against loss. In the latter case, the value of security pertains to the good of society writ large. Among other things, the ultimate good of society arguably consists in (aggregate) human well being, liberty, equality, and our democratic way of life. All of these values could potentially be compromised by pandemic risks that GOFR might reduce or exacerbate. While security (conceived as protection of such things against loss) is thus especially important, there might be reasonable disagreement about whether or not, or the extent to which, security is intrinsically valuable, or merely valuable insofar as it plays a role in promoting such things. This is an important (rather than merely academic) matter because it raises the question of whether or not, or the extent to which, it would be legitimate to make net sacrifices of (other things of) intrinsic value in order to gain more security.8\n",

Second is the question of the weight that should be given to benefits that may arise in the future\u2014i.e., what, if anything, should the \u201cfuture discount rate\u201d be in the event that GOFR entails significant risks at present in order to achieve net benefits in the future (and/or for future generations) (Murray 1994). Third, and especially important, is the question of risk aversion, risk appetite, and/or risk-taking strategy. It is common to place greater disvalue on losses than value on gains (e.g., in things like well being or money) of equal magnitude, and it is not obviously irrational to do so. Whether or not benefits of GOFR are thought to outweigh risks may thus (depending on RBA findings) partly depend on what is considered appropriate risk-taking strategy (e.g., to what extent, if any, should decision-making reflect risk aversion?). Different risk-taking strategies embodying different levels of risk aversion may yield different answers to questions about what should be done if RBA reveals that GOFR (or a certain case thereof) is reasonably likely to promote a significant amount of human well being (e.g., by facilitating disease control) but has a very small chance of leading to catastrophic consequences (e.g., in the event of laboratory accident or malevolent use of research findings).",

In the context of the environment, it might be thought that this strongest version of the precautionary principle speaks against developing and/or releasing genetically modified organisms (GMOs), because their development/release might pose serious (though, admittedly, uncertain) dangers. Sunstein (2005), however, has noted that the failure to develop and/or release GMOs might likewise pose serious (though, admittedly, uncertain) dangers, because it might turn out that GMOs enable avoidance of major famines that would otherwise occur. The strongest version of the precautionary principle would thus apparently (also) entail that we should not refrain from GMO development/release. In the context of GOFR one might argue that, according to the strongest version of the precautionary principle, we should not pursue GOFR because GOFR may lead to serious dangers involving laboratory accidents or malevolent use. By the same token, however, one might argue that we should pursue GOFR because GOFR might enable control of pandemics that would otherwise be disastrous. The strongest version of the precautionary principle thus appears to give conflicting advice regarding both GMOs and GOFR, and thus no guidance at all. Sunstein argues that people\u2019s appeal to the strongest version of the precautionary principle can be explained by the fact that they are more attuned to some kinds of dangers than others, due to cognitive bias.13\n",

Just as it would (usually) be rights-violating and thus unethical for one person (or group) to harm another, it might at first glance be thought that it would be unethical for one person (or group) to impose risk of harm on others (in the absence of explicit consent). Because ordinary action\u2014e.g., driving one\u2019s car down the street (without explicit consent of residents)\u2014involves imposing risks on others, however, it cannot be the case that every instance of risk imposition on others (in the absence of explicit consent) constitutes unethical action (Hansson 2003). We mutually benefit by allowing one another to impose (certain) risks on each other (in the absence of explicit consent); and if imposition of risks on others were ruled out, by ethics or policy, then human life would come to a standstill. This raises the question of what should be considered ethically acceptable risk imposition. Hansson argues that[while] everyone has a prima facie moral right not to be exposed to risk \u2026 this right can be overridden if [and only if] the risk-exposure is part of an equitable system for risk-taking that works to the advantage of the individual risk-exposed person (p. 291).\n",

Given global political economics, some might doubt that this is the case\u2014because some people exposed to the risks involved benefit more from scientific and technological advance than others. If Hansson\u2019s principle is taken to be absolute, then risks associated with the scientific and technological enterprise would be considered unacceptable if such doubts about equity are justified. If a degree of inequity is inevitable (in light of global political economics) but the scientific and technological enterprise nonetheless perhaps enormously benefits the vast majority of (though not all) people exposed to the risks involved, then one might think that the risk imposition in question is actually justified. If Hansson\u2019s principle is absolute, then it would apparently always prioritize equity over utility, but it is plausible that small compromises regarding equity are at least sometimes outweighed by large utility gains (Selgelid 2009b). A more moderate (and less binary) principle than that defended by Hansson (but which nonetheless remains sensitive to rights and distributive/egalitarian concerns) might run as follows: while everyone has a prima facie moral right not to be exposed to risk, over-riding of this right is ethically acceptable to the degree that risk-exposure is part of an equitable system for risk-taking that works to the advantage of risk-exposed persons.

DDE holds that it may be morally permissible to pursue an action with a foreseen bad effect so long as the action in question is not itself morally problematic, the bad effect is not itself intended (it is merely foreseen), an intended good effect is directly produced by the action in question (and not directly produced by the bad effect), and this intended good effect outweighs the foreseen bad effect (the proportionality condition) (Uniacke 2013, p. 155). Suzanne Uniacke illustrates the application of DDE to a case where a driver must swerve a car into the path of an innocent pedestrian in order to avoid crashing into a crowd. According to DDE, this might be ethically permissible because the killing of the pedestrian is merely foreseen rather than intended, the saving of the crowd is brought about by the swerving of the car (rather than being caused by the death of the pedestrian), and the many lives saved outweigh the one life lost.",

This partly depends on whether DDE is a plausible principle\u2014which has been the subject of much ethical controversy.17 In any case, Uniacke points out numerous differences between scenarios where DDE is commonly thought to apply and dual use dilemmas:In prototypical DDE scenarios the foreseen bad effect is (usually) expected with certainty or high probability, but in the dual use context bad effects are merely a foreseen possibility (and/or presumably often considered to be low probability).In prototypical DDE scenarios the foreseen bad effect is (usually) directly produced by the moral agent in question, but in the dual use context the foreseen possible bad effect would result from the malevolent action of others.18\n\n",
