Subsequently, this cranial pair is divided into two branches and is directed towards the olfactory nucleus present in the pyriform cortex [10] . This nerve route has been used by some coronaviruses in rodent models exposed to nasal inoculation [11,12]. For example, after exposure to SARS-CoV by inhalation, Netland et al. detected the coronavirus after 60 h in the olfactory bulb and after four days its dissemination to the pyriform cortex and dorsal nucleus of the rafe was confirmed, the latter located on the brain stem [11]. Similar results were found in a Canadian study with another coronavirus, HCoV-OC43. In this case, by the fourth day of inoculation, the virus had already spread to the piriformis cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord [12]. On the other hand, a study from the 1990s showed that interruption by ablation in the olfactory pathway did not allow the neural spread of the MHV coronavirus in an animal model [7].",

Breathing has central control given by the regulation of a number of neural groups. Through the nucleus of the solitary fascicle, the CNS receives information from the chemoreceptors that detect changes in the concentrations of CO2 and O2, alterations in these components lead to an increase or decrease in respiratory effort [13]. In this way, stem nuclei have connections with the respiratory system [1,13], and the entry of the coronavirus into this structure could trigger death by alteration of these neuronal groups [1].",
