CRCoV is a group 2 coronavirus and is genetically most closely related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV). The virus appears to be particularly prevalent in housed populations and within 3 weeks of entry to a kennel, dogs develop antibodies to the virus (Erles et al., 2003). Serological evidence of the virus exists in three continents (Decaro et al., 2007, Kaneshima et al., 2006, Priestnall et al., 2006, Priestnall et al., 2007), however little is known regarding the pathogenesis of the infection and the possible role of the virus in the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex.",

The induction of epithelial chemokines, e.g. IL-8 may also be a primary event triggering increased airway reactivity in acute viral infection (Kazachkov et al., 2002). Production of TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1 during virus infection may occur either directly or indirectly, for example as a result of cellular damage or via induction of other cytokines. TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to stimulate mucus glycoprotein secretion by airway epithelial cells within 1 h of exposure (Adler et al., 1994). TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 can also affect ciliary beat frequency indirectly through the increased synthesis of endothelin by tracheal epithelial cells (Adler et al., 1994). Quantitative PCR has previously been used to demonstrate significantly increased transcription of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and a number of other pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines in epithelium infected with feline herpesvirus type-1 (FHV-1), suggesting a previously unknown role for FHV-1 in feline chronic nasal discharge (Johnson and Maggs, 2005).",

The mean CRCoV nucleocapsid gene copy number within tracheal cultures from different dogs at 24\u201396 h post-inoculation was determined (Fig. 4\n). In all cases, there was an overall increase in CRCoV nucleocapsid gene RNA copies during the experiment and the peak copy number was attained at 96 h post-inoculation for each dog. However, in some dogs, there was a noticeable fall in copy number at 48 or 72 h, compared to the levels at 24 h, thus the dynamics of the infection appeared to be different for tracheal cultures from different dogs. Due to this finding, cytokine mRNA levels were also analysed relative to CRCoV copy number, to control for individual variation between the tracheas from different dogs. The quantification of canine IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA copies in CRCoV-inoculated cultures was presented as the logarithm of the fold change relative to control-inoculated cultures in the same dog at the same time point. These data were plotted against CRCoV nucleocapsid RNA copies in the same cDNA sample. The Pearson correlation coefficient, r was determined for each cytokine using SPSS v. 16.0.

Peak levels for all three cytokine mRNAs were detected at 48 h and had declined by 72 h. Interestingly, CRCoV appeared to suppress the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines from 24 to 72 h post-inoculation, however at 96 h the levels were raised for each cytokine. When correlated with actual copies of virus, it appeared that at lower copy number (as would be present during the earlier part of the time-course), there was active suppression of cytokine mRNA, relative to controls. However, it seemed that once the virus copies reached a threshold, of 100 copies ng cDNA\u22121, cytokine mRNA levels were increased relative to controls, as recorded at 96 h. It is conceivable that early non-structural proteins produced by the replicating virus may act to inhibit the induction of cytokine and chemokine genes.

The assay demonstrated that the growth kinetics of CRCoV within this system were not linear. Despite the application of a uniform virus inoculum, differences in ciliary function and the thickness and nature of the mucus layer between dogs may have resulted in variation in the physical barrier to virus receptor binding and penetration of epithelial cells. Cultures from all dogs included in this study were subject to an increase in overall CRCoV nucleoprotein gene RNA copies by 96 h post-inoculation, indicating that viral replication was occurring.

Cultures were shown to retain co-ordinated ciliary beating for up to 144 h post-mortem in this system. Ciliary function declined between the time of death and culture inoculation. However, following inoculation, the ciliary clearance of LPS-inoculated cultures was significantly reduced with respect to both the speed and extent of clearance of latex relative to controls. Whilst the effects of CRCoV on ciliary function were not found to be significantly different to controls, CRCoV was capable of limiting the ciliary function of canine tracheal epithelium at 48 h post-inoculation. Between 72 and 96 h, the ciliary clearance of CRCoV-inoculated cultures was similar to that of controls, suggesting that any effects of CRCoV on the respiratory epithelium happen early in the course of infection.",
