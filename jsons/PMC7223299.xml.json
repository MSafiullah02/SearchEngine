            "text": "In the United States, laws vary widely on who has the authority to make medical decisions for PWPs and what types of decisions they can make. While consent can be assumed in a true emergency, many non-emergent situations still require decisions earlier than the weeks-to-months it would take to appoint a guardian. A recent legal review by Thaddeus Pope highlights the confusing patchwork of laws that various states have passed in order to address this issue (2017). A number of states have taken preventative measures, such as expanding the list of legally acceptable surrogates to include more distant relatives, or friends. A few have authorized the physician to make certain decisions, often after seeking a second medical opinion. Others have authorized physicians to make decisions after consulting an ethics committee. Many limit the decisions or prescribe a \u201ctiered\u201d approach. Currently, there is no consistency in the law, and many states (such as ours) have yet to address the issue at all.",

We suspect that in most cases, the medical team makes decisions for PWPs based on the best interest standard, which is supported by the findings of White et al. (2006, 2007). However, increasing attention to this problem in the last decade has led to the development of alternative protocols (Kim and Song 2018). In 2005, our urban hospital designed a protocol, described below, in which an ethics subcommittee composed of community volunteers meets with the medical team to make shared decisions for these patients (Hyun et al. 2006). Since then, the ethics service has received 191 referrals for PWPs and conducted 80 PWP committee meetings (Griggins et al. 2019).",

Briefly, when the medical team identifies a PWP who will require imminent, but non-emergent medical decisions, they are advised to contact the ethics consultation service. The consultant first works with the medical team and social worker to conduct an aggressive search for a surrogate, or, failing that, to find someone who knows the patient and can provide information as to what treatment the patient might have wanted. By using creative search techniques, the consultants are often successful in finding a surrogate or another source of information such as a friend, clergy, or previous health care provider. Occasionally surrogates are incapacitated themselves, or refuse to take on the role of decision-maker. Our state law prevents many of these people (friends, neighbors, etc.) from serving as surrogates, but they are often available and willing to contribute by telling us what they know of the patient\u2019s life and values.",

However, after 10 days, she still could not be weaned from the ventilator, and had shown no signs of cognitive recovery.

Interviewees expressed a variety of opinions about this, weighing the benefits of gaining additional information and humanizing the patient against the risk of introducing bias into the decision-making process. Ultimately, most committee members felt that seeing the patient was at the very least permissible and in some cases obligatory. We agree that seeing critically ill patients may elicit a strong emotional response from committee members, and that medical professionals are much less likely to react in such a way.

Perhaps a neighbor says the patient was fiercely independent and valued physical activity above all other aspects of life; or staff at the patient\u2019s nursing home describe a patient\u2019s recognition of poor quality of life and expressed wishes to stop treatment. In these cases, there is at least some indication that a patient\u2019s wish might be to set limits on treatments, or forego them entirely. Alternatively, knowing that a patient had a positive outlook and adjusted well to life in a nursing facility does not tell us exactly what a patient would want, but suggests the patient\u2019s tolerance for extended rehabilitation or permanent residence in a facility.

However, we feel that the protocol facilitates decision-making that is ethically more desirable than \u201cbest interest\u201d based on what a \u201creasonable person\u201d would want given the risks, benefits, and likelihood of success. Because we have been able to gather important information about the patient\u2019s lifestyle and quality of life in almost all cases, we believe that we are utilizing a hybrid standard, which we have termed \u201cinformed best interest\u201d. We believe that \u201cinformed best interest\u201d is best determined by rigorous dialogue between the medical team and committee members. Committee members do not perceive they are simply \"rubber-stamping\" the doctor\u2019s decision; rather, they have thorough discussions commensurate with the gravity of the decision at hand. The process is made transparent by recording all attempts to locate surrogates and information gathered about each patient, as well as the deliberations and decisions made for them. Finally, fairness is served by adherence to the same protocol for every PWP case.",

Our protocol ensures that every attempt is made to respect the autonomy of these patients by mandating a thorough search for suitable surrogates and other evidence of the patient\u2019s wishes. It minimizes medical and institutional bias by including community members in the decision-making process. By identifying these patients, aggressively searching for family and background information, reaching a consensus on the most ethical treatment plan, and tracking outcomes, we have established a level of transparency and oversight that was previously lacking.",

Providing treatment recommendations that can be life altering, and in some cases, life ending, can generate feelings of discomfort and moral ambiguity. Several interviewees admitted to occasionally dwelling on past cases and wondering whether they made the right decision. A more formalized review and debriefing process could be initiated, which would be helpful for quality control and training, as well as a source of closure for the committee members. At this time, PWP cases are reviewed on a regular basis by the full ethics committee. The purpose is to ensure rigor and consistency in the decision-making process, as well as to inform committee members about the outcomes of their cases. However, it would be beneficial to also debrief committee members periodically, one-on-one, to provide an opportunity to discuss any concerns they may not be comfortable sharing with the full committee. Talking through challenging cases with others may lessen any negative feelings and protect against burnout. While these negative feelings are an important concern, the committee members also take great satisfaction in helping these patients. It is worth noting that no PWP committee members have dropped out or avoided meetings due to burnout.",

At the very least, our protocol identifies these patients and provides transparency and accountability in decision-making. We have a committee of community members who are empathic and knowledgeable in clinical and ethical decision-making, doing their best to represent patients who otherwise have no one to speak for them. Their background and experience give them the confidence to question the medical team thoroughly, understand the options, and make a reasoned judgment based on \u201cinformed best interest\u201d. No protocol for PWP decision-making will avoid the moral discomfort and uncertainty involved in making decisions for this patient population, nor should that be the goal. Rather, PWP protocols should focus on improving on the status quo by implementing thorough procedures for finding background information about the patient, promoting transparency, and minimizing conflict of interest.",
