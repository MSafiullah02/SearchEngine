In a review of 62 cases with ECMO therapy, the survival rate was 55% [6]; 17.8% of patients died as a result of ECMO-related complications, translated into a mortality of 8% due to ECMO alone. A retrospective U.S. database analysis (1986-2006) demonstrated a mortality rate of 50% in patients treated with ECMO.

High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) are characterized by rapid delivery of small tidal volumes (Vt) (1-3 ml/kg predicted body weight) at high frequencies (2.5-5 Hz). As such, Pmean during jet ventilation is comparable to the pressure level of PEEP in conventional mechanical ventilation due to its minimal Vt. Yet, Ppeak and Pmean are markedly reduced with a reduction of tidal hyperinflation and tidal decruitment [8]. Furthermore, oxygen toxicity may be reduced as lower FiO2 often are required compared with mandatory ventilation [8]. This beneficial effect could be demonstrated in animal models of HFOV. In addition, pulmonary compliance improved, the infiltration of polymorph nuclear leukocytes was reduced, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels attenuated. As a result, injury to alveoli and membranous bronchioles was reduced [9].",

The other patient was admitted to our ICU after a prolonged period of severe hypoxemia and septic shock with hypoperfusion. All five patients had a HSV-PCR-positive BAL, confirmed via lung biopsy in one patient. Viral coinfection with HSV may cause and prolongs a status of persistent immunosuppression during severe H1N1 infection, which is associated with a high risk of death. This hypothesis is supported by findings of Monsalvo and colleagues, who found pathogenic immune complexes as previously unknown biological mechanism for the unusual age distribution of severe H1N1 infections [11].",

Compared with ECMO, it is easier to use, associated with fewer complications, cost-effective, and can be used in secondary and tertiary centers. Therefore, SHFJV is an alternative approach to improve lung function and oxygenation in patients suffering from ARDS. Nevertheless, this report is limited by the small study size, including a heterogeneous patient collective. Therefore, a controlled study with SHFJV to treat patients with ARDS is required for an evidence-based conclusion.",
