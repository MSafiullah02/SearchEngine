The outpatient hall and emergency hall each have only 1 entrance and 1 exit. Upon arrival, all patients need to go through \u201c3 passes.\u201d The first pass is the pre-examination and triage stage where doctors and nurses take temperature measurements and do a triage evaluation. The epidemiological history and clinical symptoms of the patients are carefully collected by the triage personnel. Each fever patient is issued a surgical mask and provides registration details traceability. According to the specific content of the questionnaire, an Healthy-QR color code is set as red, yellow, or green. Patients assigned a red code are escorted to the fever clinic by special staff on a designated route. The yellow code is used to alert the follow-up clinic after the discharge of a COVID-19 patient. A green code provides the patient entry to the outpatient hall. The second pass is a specialized triage pass. The patient first presents the Healthy-QR color code assigned in the first pass. The triage nurse takes the patient\u2019s temperature again and acquires an oral epidemiological history. In the third triage pass, the patient enters a consulting room, where a doctor signs off on the patient\u2019s written epidemiological history and the patient\u2019s medical history. These two signed notices are then filed. In the second and third triage passes, the patients identified with fever at the pre-examination are delivered to the fever clinic along a designated route by assigned staff from the pre-examination triage. The areas that the patients pass through are disinfected immediately.",

To our knowledge, this is the first time a fever clinic has been divided into different areas. The 2 fever clinics are relatively independent and do not overlap. Patients are screened and assigned a Healthy-QR color code (Fig. 3).
