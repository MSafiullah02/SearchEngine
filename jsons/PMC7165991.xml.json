Moreover, the incidence of certain OIs, including oesophageal candidiasis, nontuberculosis mycobacterial infection, CMV disease and non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma, decreased significantly, but only after 3 months of HAART, whereas the incidence of other OIs, including PCP, toxoplasmosis and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), decreased within 3 months of starting HAART. Thus, it should be noted that some OIs still occur despite virologically successful HAART, while other OIs still occur mainly in patients who have not had access to therapy or who failed antiretroviral therapy.",

The lung is a major site for opportunistic pathogens, such as PCP, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and pyogenic bacteria. Wolff et al. [14] have clearly shown that PCP has been a less common diagnosis since HAART became available, whereas bacterial pneumonia has been more common in patients treated with HAART than in those treated in the pre\u2010HAART era. In contrast, another study found a significant decrease in bacterial pneumonia in patients treated with HAART [15]. No difference was found in the incidence of CMV pneumonia in HIV\u20101\u2010infected patients receiving or not receiving HAART [14]. In addition, Jones et al. [16] observed that the risk for tuberculosis was much lower among patients treated with HAART, and they pointed out that widespread use of HAART does reduce the risk of tuberculosis, and may help bring about further declines in tuberculosis among HIV\u20101\u2010infected patients. Finally, the impact of HAART on pulmonary malignancies has not been fully investigated. Wolff et al. [14] showed a significant increase in non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma in patients receiving HAART compared with the pre\u2010HAART era. Similarly, the incidence of HIV\u20101\u2010related lung cancer increased from 0.8/100 patient\u2010years in the pre\u2010HAART era to 6.7/100 patient\u2010years in the post\u2010HAART era [17].",

In a recent study, Neuenburg et al. [21] confirmed a decreased incidence of OIs of the CNS, including toxoplasmosis, CMV infection and cryptococcosis. In particular, a progressive reduction in the incidence of cerebral toxoplasmosis was observed in the HAART era [21, 22, 23], but this infection still tended to occur regularly in patients with advanced immunosuppression, especially in those patients who failed HAART.",

An autopsy study showed increased HIV\u20101 encephalopathy from 1982 to 1993, and persistence of mild HIV\u20101 encephalopathy from 1994\u20131998 [24]. Thus, in the HAART era there has been a persistent increase in mild and moderate HIV\u20101 encephalopathy, whereas severe HIV\u20101 encephalopathy, which was uncommon in the pre\u2010HAART era, has not been observed at all in the HAART era [21]. The trend towards an amelioration of HIV\u20101 encephalopathy in the HAART era might be explained by direct inhibition of HIV within the brain, as well as improvement of immunological markers, by HAART; moreover, HAART may lead to suppression of inflammatory neurotoxins within the brain [25].",

The vigorous HAART\u2010induced immune response can produce organ\u2010specific lesions in unusual locations, and histological examination of these lesions shows an intense inflammatory response surrounding few, if any, microorganisms [6]. MAC was among the first organisms associated with this syndrome. The presence of granulomas suggests that the clinical manifestation is attributable to a restored inflammatory response. In addition, necrotic subcutaneous nodules, endobronchial tumours, small bowel involvement, and paravertebral abscesses have all been reported as MAC\u2010related unusual lesions [6]. A retrospective review of patients with M. tuberculosis infection treated with HAART found an 8.7% prevalence of paradoxical CNS lesions, including intracranial tuberculoma [107]. There have been cases of mediastinal lymphadenitis, as well as subcutaneous abscesses associated with cryptococcal infection, that occurred months after the institution of HAART (Table 4). A new type of ocular disease in the setting of CMV infection was recognized after the introduction of HAART, which has been termed \u2018immune recovery vitreitis\u2019. The inflammatory response can induce proliferative vitreoretinopathy and posterior subcapsular cataracts [108]. Shelburne et al. [6] described a patient who had worsening of cutaneous KS coincident with immune recovery due to HAART.",
