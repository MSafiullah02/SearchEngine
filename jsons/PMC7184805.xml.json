Prior to the pandemic, the team of 18 Interventional Radiologists (IRs) covered three different sites on a rotational roster. This has been stopped since the beginning of the outbreak and each site has been assigned its dedicated IRs. Within the largest site at the Singapore General Hospital, the IR department is also divided into two functional IR teams (each team consisting of doctors, nurses and radiographers), and they are discouraged to intermingle socially during and after office hours. If in the instance one of the teams is quarantined, there would still be another to manage urgent cases. Physical distancing for staff within each team is practised during meal times when staff are not wearing their masks, and meal times are staggered.",

In our current practice, all staff in clinical areas don surgical masks. When in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, full personal protection equipment (PPE) is necessary. Full PPE in our IR service includes scrub cap, N95 mask (FFP2 or FFP3), eye shield, full length gown and gloves. The proper sequence of donning and doffing of PPE can be found on the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention website [12]. There is currently no specific recommendation for use of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR). While it is an alternative to N95 mask for protection against airborne spread, there are disadvantages such as communication difficulties due to the noise from the blowing air and potential cross-contamination if the filters are not disposed properly or if the hood is not cleaned properly [13]. In our institution, PAPR is used as an alternative for those who failed the mask fit test for N95 mask, and when performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) on COVID-19 patients [14]. We consider intubation and per-nasal or per-oral procedures like nasogastric tube insertion to be AGPs. In the scenario where the COVID-19 patient requires intubation for a non-AGP, only the anaesthetic staff will be donning PAPR while the rest of the staff in the procedural room is in full PPE only. It is our institutional practice for staff to shower following procedures involving COVID-19 patients as the final step in self decontamination. Shoes are also to be washed at the shower. All staff are thus encouraged to have a change of garments, including socks.",
