Early in his academic medical career, Virchow conducted animal experiments such as the study of the life cycle of Trichinella spiralis in porcine muscular tissue and cysticercosis and tuberculosis in cattle; he coined the term \u201czoonosis.\u201d3 His efforts helped lead to regular meat inspections by veterinarians in Europe and eventually in the United States. In 1873, Osler, who had recently received his medical degree from McGill University, left Canada to study with Virchow in Berlin. Virchow impressed upon the young Osler the importance of the autopsy and of scientific inquiry in the practice of medicine. Osler returned to Canada in 1874, where he established veterinary pathology as an academic discipline in a North American school of veterinary medicine.4\n",

This strategy is important because there have been recent emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks, including the Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and avian influenza (A) H5N1, that are spreading across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Reasons for the emergence of these zoonotic diseases include: intensive agricultural practices, global trade in exotic animals, consumption of \u201cbush meat,\u201d and human population pressures. We must anticipate many more zoonotic disease outbreaks \u201cemerging\u201d in the future.",

Visionary leaders and educators of medicine embraced the fact that zoonotic pathogens infect both humans and animals and, as a result, they encouraged their physician colleagues to work closely with their veterinary medical colleagues. On June 25th, 2007, the American Medical Association House of Delegates approved a \u201cOne Health\u201d resolution, which promotes the partnership between human and veterinary medicine. The American Veterinary Medical Association set up a task force of prominent veterinarians, physicians, and allied health scientists in July 2007. It was charged with developing strategies to implement the \u201cOne Health\u201d concept. These are important steps toward our understanding of how to control, and ultimately, prevent zoonotic disease transmission, which would improve the health and lives of both animals and humans. Schools of medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health should embrace the \u201cOne Health\u201d concept and prepare their students to meet the challenges of the future.",
