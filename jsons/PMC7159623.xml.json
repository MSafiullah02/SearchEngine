Systemic diseases are also those affecting a system which is distributed all over the body, such as the nervous system (CNS), the vascular system, or the blood. Systemic diseases include for example leukemia, anemia, central nervous systemic diseases, vasculitis, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, hemochromatosis, rheumatological disorders, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or mucoviszidosis 1. Some of these disorders secondarily affect the skeletal muscle, manifesting as myositis, muscle abscess, endocrine or metabolic myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or myasthenia. The following review aims at summarizing and discussing recent advances concerning the management of muscle disease in systemic diseases, including infectious diseases, endocrinological disorders, metabolic disorders, immunological disorders, vascular disorders, and hematological disorders.",

Most frequently myositis is due to infection with the influenza 7 or parainfluenza virus 9. These patients may present with acute onset calf pain, tenderness, or gait disturbance 9. Myositis in dengue infection can be fulminant and affect the respiratory muscles requiring artificial ventilation 18. Only rarely is myositis due to infection with parvovirus\u2010B19 10, HCV 19, or the West Nile virus 20. Chronic HCV infection may be also associated with dermatomyositis 21 or inclusion body myositis 22. Infection with the New Jersey polyomavirus NJPyV\u20102013 may cause vasculitic myopathy 2. Muscle\u2010tropic viruses often spread to the CNS, which may dramatically increase morbidity and mortality 23. Whether patients with an underlying subclinical primary or secondary myopathy or those taking muscle\u2010toxic drugs are particularly prone to develop viral myositis is unknown. Infection with HIV\u20101 may be associated with polymyositis, dermatomyositis, or inclusion body myositis 17. Polymyositis from HIV\u20101 may be complicated by the development of muscle abscesses 24. HIV\u2010myositis may be even the initial manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 25.",

The main complication of rhabdomyolysis is acute renal failure, often requiring hemofiltration or hemodialysis 28. Rhabdomyolysis occurs in 1% of the patients with dengue infections. Risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis include myalgia, arterial hypertension, and acute renal failure 29.

            "text": "Bacterial infections associated with myositis usually manifest as bacterial polymyositis 46. Commonly, bacterial polymyositis is a purulent infection accompanied by muscle abscesses (pyomyositis) 46. The main etiologic agent of bacterial polymyositis is Staphylococcus aureus 46. Staphylococcal pyomyositis is a severe infection with high mortality being increasingly recognized in temperate climates 47. Pyomyositis may originate from a focal infection such as arthritis, sacroiliitis, a spinal abscess, or from bacteremia or sepsis. Pyomyositis may develop after trauma, may remain focal, and may resolve upon a nonsurgical approach 48. Pyomyositis may affect a single muscle, such as the rectus femoris muscle 49, or may affect all muscles resulting in quadriparesis, as described in a patient after induction of chemotherapy for lymphoblastic leukemia 50. Pyomyositis may be diagnosed with ultrasound and culture of the aspirate 51. Pyomyositis of the iliopsoas muscle may be complicated by septic pulmonary embolism 47. These patients may require abscess drainage under CT\u2010guidance 47. Presence of intramuscular hemangiomas seems to predispose for pyomyositis, as reported in a 4\u2010year\u2010old child with fatal meningitis 46. Sepsis from streptococcus group\u2010G originating from arthritis may cause diffuse polymyositis without skin lesions or toxic shock syndrome 52. A severe form of bacterial myositis is streptococcal necrotizing myositis, which is often fatal 53. Muscle abscesses may also result from infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae 49 or mycobacterium tuberculosis 54. A rare cause of systemic myositis may be infection with campylobacter jejuni 55. Predisposing factors include skin penetration or impaired host immunocompetence (HIV\u20101, transplant recipient) 47.",

Causative agents include sarcocystis, plasmodium falciparum, toxoplasma gondi, neospora, microspora, borrelia, pleistophora, babesia, ehrlichia, or trypanosoma. Muscular sarcocystis is clinically characterized by myalgia with or without fever, and delayed onset of hyper\u2010CKemia and eosinophilia with the possibility of relapses 65. Muscular sarcocystis is particularly prevalent in Malaysia 65. Other frequent protozoal infections with muscular involvement include toxoplasmosis 66 and malaria 67. In toxoplasmosis, severe polymyositis may be even the presenting manifestation 66. In a patient with AIDS, myositis due to toxoplasmosis developed despite adequate antimicrobial treatment 68. Rarely, toxoplasmosis may be associated with dermatomyositis 69. Occasionally, falciparum malaria may manifest with myositis 67. A rare protozoic infection with muscle involvement is neosporosis 70. In immune\u2010compromised patients, microsporidia, obligate intracellular parasites, may manifest as focal or generalized myositis 71, 72. Focal myositis may be also a rare manifestation of Lyme disease (Lyme myositis) 73, 74. Lyme myositis may even mimic dermatomyositis 75. Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi may also cause idiopathic inflammatory myopathy 76. In immune\u2010compromised patients, myositis may be rarely caused by pleistophora 77. Ocular myositis may be caused by ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, or Lyme disease 78. In immune\u2010compromised patients, ocular myositis may be also due to Trypanosoma cruzi infection 79.",

Helminthes potentially affecting the muscle include Toxocara (toxocarosis) 83, Echinococcus granulosus (hydatidosis) 84, Cysticercus (cysticercosis) 85, Trichinella (trichinosis) 86, Strongyloides (strongyloidiasis) 87, Haycocknema perplexum 88, Spirometra (sparganosis) 89, Fasciola (fasciolosis) 90, or Filaria (filariasis). Toxocara infection may go along with lumbar myositis 83. In the tropics, visceral larva migrans (toxocarosis) may manifest as tropical pyomyositis requiring repeated debridement 91. Hydatid cysts from infestation with Echinococcus may rarely occur in a single muscle as the initial manifestation 84, 92. Most commonly, liver and lung are affected 92. Hydatid cysts of the muscle have been occasionally observed in patients with primary muscle disease 93. Cysticercosis may initially manifest as ptosis if the lid elevator is affected 94. Cysticercosis may also manifest as ocular myositis 95. Focal cysticercal myositis may be diagnosed with muscle ultrasound or MRI 85. Trichinosis manifests clinically in the muscle as myalgias due to dermato\u2010polymyositis 86, 96. Trichinella has a unique relation to the muscle as it is located intracellularly. Patients may present with myalgia and fever, and elevated muscle enzymes 97. Rarely, trichinosis may go along with muscle weakness 98. In case of focal necrosis due to trichinosis, EMG may show profuse fibrillations 99. Later in the course, fibrosis and contractures may develop 99. Strongyloides rarely affects the musculature. Occasionally, patients taking steroids or immuno\u2010suppressants may develop polymyositis from strongyloides infestation 87. In Australia, myositis may be due to infestation with the nematode Haycocknema perplexum 88. In single cases, sparganosis may manifest as ocular myositis 89.

Diabetic myopathy encompasses a spectrum of abnormalities, including wasting, muscle inflammation, ischemia, infarction, hemorrhage, necrosis, fibrosis, or fatty atrophy 101. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the underlying abnormality. The most frequent muscle manifestation in diabetes is painless muscle wasting (diabetic amyotrophy), which is either due to a diabetic plexus lesion 102 or due to affection of satellite cells by the diabetes 103. A further frequent manifestation of diabetic myopathy is diabetic myonecrosis presenting as self\u2010limiting condition with acute onset of swelling and severe muscle pain 104. Typically, patients have no fever, normal white blood cell count, normal blood sedimentation rate, but elevated C\u2010reactive protein 104. Usually, myonecrosis occurs in poorly controlled diabetes 105. The diagnosis is established by muscle MRI, and the treatment of choice is bed rest and analgesics 104. An increasingly recognized manifestation of diabetic myopathy is diabetic muscle infarction, which is regarded as rare and occurs in long\u2010standing diabetic patients 106. Clinical manifestations of muscle infarction include acute onset local pain, together with a focal, palpable mass lesion. The diagnosis is established by muscle MRI 106.
