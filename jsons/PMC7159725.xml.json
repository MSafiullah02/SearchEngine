A total of 6 patients were prospectively enrolled in this study (Table 1). The experimental group consisted of 3 patients with known CF as documented by genotype testing and nasal polyposis visualized on nasal endoscopy. All 3 of the patients with CF had prior sinus or bronchoalveolar lavage cultures demonstrating colonization with both Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The comparison group consisted of 3 patients without CF, who presented with aspirin\u2010tolerant nasal polyposis diagnosed on history, physical examination, and nasal endoscopy. All 6 patients had been treated with a standard regimen of daily nasal steroids and nasal saline irrigations prior to biopsy. Oral steroids were not used in any patient for at least one month prior to biopsy. Diagnosis of benign inflammatory polyp was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain.",

Patient records were checked for preoperative oral and topical nasal steroid use. Tissue sections (5 \u03bcm) were mounted on charged glass slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and baked overnight at 60\u00b0C. A monoclonal mouse anti\u2010human Bcl\u20102 antibody was obtained for immunohistochemical staining (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Slides were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with a graded alcohol series. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3.0% hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes. A decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) with citrate buffer (20 mmol/L) was used for antigen retrieval at 120\u00b0C for 15 minutes. An autostainer (Dako) was used to perform the staining. The Envision+ Dual Link HRP (Dako) detection kit was used according to the product's protocol. The final Bcl\u20102 antibody dilution was 1:400. Slides were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with this antibody. Positive control slides with sections of normal human tonsillar tissue (Dako) were utilized. Negative control staining was performed on all sections using plain antibody diluent (Dako) in place of the Bcl\u20102 antibody. Bcl\u20102 staining was visualized by development with 3,3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzidine (Dako), counterstained with hematoxylin, and dehydrated with graded alcohols. Coverslips were placed.

Additionally, these studies have shown an even higher proportion of cells in S\u2010phase in the CF polyp subtype, initiating the belief that there were molecular differences in nasal polyps of CF patients.15, 16 The Bcl family of proteins, which regulates the apoptosis pathway, is known to interact with a multitude of other cell regulatory proteins, including Map 1b, cyclin D1, and several cyclin\u2010dependent kinases. These proteins all have a role in cell\u2010cycle progression. Bcl\u2010xl is considered the dominant regulator of apoptosis. It is known to regulate interleukin\u20101beta (IL\u20101\u03b2) production in macrophages, and has been found in higher amounts in granulocytes of patients with CF. In rat models, Bcl\u2010xl interacts with coronavirus to prevent apoptosis in epithelial cells, causing acute infection to become persistent.17 Furthermore, the Bcl family of proteins is closely tied to p53 dysregulation, which has been recently associated with increased lymphocytic infiltrates in nasal polyps.18\n",

First, with this array protocol it is not possible to separate the individual contributions of the epithelial, fibroblast, and lymphocytic populations within the overall protein extract. As a result, with this technology, we cannot conclude which cell type is dysregulated. Second, pathologic differences may not be innate to the disease process, but may be effects of the local microenvironment of the polyp biopsy. Perhaps chronic inflammation resulting from S. aureus or P. aeruginosa contributes to these changes in protein expression. Third, patient to patient variability may become a factor when grouping 3 samples together. For instance, if a single patient highly expresses a particular protein, that protein may appear to be dysregulated in the overall group. Last, one must consider that our results demonstrate roughly 2\u2010fold dysregulation; from anecdotal experience, 10\u2010fold or even higher dysregulation may be discovered with use of this array. Hence, it is somewhat arbitrary what level one considers suggestive of functionally significant dysregulation based on array results.",

This computer\u2010based analysis carries with it multiple limitations as well. First, many programs designed to quantify the intensity of staining of a specific chromogen, such as the algorithm we used in this study, will not differentiate between specific and nonspecific background staining. In attempt to overcome this limitation, we reviewed our slides with an attending pathologist to ensure our staining was specific and that an insignificant degree of nonspecific background staining was present. Second, a trained pathologist will be superior to a computer program at distinguishing specific cell types to determine which populations might be associated with higher intensities of staining. Our algorithm did not distinguish cell types but rather quantified the average staining intensity of the entire polyp. Last, our chromogen (diaminobenzidine) demonstrates a linear relationship between antigen concentration and staining intensity only with certain antigen concentration ranges.11 Consequently, any potential nonlinear relationship between antigen concentration and staining intensity may potentially result in inaccurate results outputted from the automated image analysis program.",

Three techniques for studying protein expression were used: protein microarray, Western immunoblot, and immunohistochemical staining. Protein microarrays may be used as a tool for mass analysis of changes in protein expression in cultured cells or fresh tissue. This technique is rapid, easy to use, and can detect protein levels as low as a few nanograms per milliliter. Automated image analysis of immunohistochemical staining is another rapid technique which can reduce the arbitrary nature of traditional scoring systems. Our use of these emerging technologies in the study of CF nasal polyps suggests an upregulation of Bcl\u20102 family proteins in these tissues relative to non\u2010CF nasal polyps. Dysregulations of the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways may have a contributory role in the pathophysiology of polyp formation and progression in patients with CF.
