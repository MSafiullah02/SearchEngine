Although A, B, and C types of influenza exist, type C is detected much less frequently than the other two types and tends to cause only mild infection in humans [1]. In contrast, both A and B types cause outbreaks and epidemics; accordingly, circulating strains of both types are incorporated in seasonal influenza vaccines [1]. Human influenza is most commonly caused by type A viruses, which are the only type known to cause pandemics. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on surface hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins [1]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the H1N1 (A (H1N1) pdm09) and H3N2 subtypes are currently circulating among humans [1].",

Subsequently, the WHO declared a pandemic level phase 6 in June 2009. During the pandemic, viral spread via person-to-person contact affected at least 214 countries worldwide, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. A total of 18,500 laboratory-confirmed deaths were recorded between April 2009 and the end of the pandemic on August 10, 2010 [7]. However, the actual number of respiratory and cardiovascular deaths was estimated to range between 151,700 and 575,500 [7]. After the pandemic, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 replaced the previously circulating seasonal H1N1 and has since remained in seasonal circulation [6]. Currently, circulating influenza B viruses are divided into two main lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria [1].",

PCRs were performed using the LightCycler 2.0 instrument (Roche Diagnostics). All PCRs were performed according to the following conditions: 58 \u00b0C for 8 min; 95 \u00b0C for 30 s; 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 s, 60 \u00b0C for 20 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 s; and cooling to 40 \u00b0C for 30 s. For the M2 PCR, two sets of probes and primers (targeting human nucleic acid and influenza A/M2 gene) and four controls were used [extracted control for human nucleic acid (internal sample control), commercial positive plasmid control for the whole PCR, negative extracted control (water), and no template negative control]. For H1 PCR, one set of probes and primers and three controls were used [commercial positive plasmid control for the whole PCR, negative extracted control (water), and no template negative control].",
