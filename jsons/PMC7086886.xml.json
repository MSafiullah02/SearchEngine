In the standard genetic code, a set of 61 codons encodes the 20 standard amino acids. Other than tryptophan and methionine, all amino acids are represented by more than one codon, resulting in codon redundancy. The condition of biased usage of some codons preferentially over other synonymous codons is known as codon usage bias (CUB), and it is specific for every genome [3, 29, 30, 53]. CUB differs among genomes as well as within the same genome, and studying these differences may help us to understand genome evolution among related species [66] as well as the relationship between host cells and viruses or immune reactions [62].",

In the neutral theory, mutational pressure at degenerate positions of a codon must be neutral, such that there is nonuniform usage of synonymous codons for a specific amino acid, indicating a lack of natural selection [48]. The level of gene expression has been shown to be associated with CUB [63, 64], whereas the selection-mutation-drift model postulates the importance of genetic drift, mutation pressure, and natural selection in the establishment of CUB [63, 64]. Natural selection of highly expressed genes can play an important role [31], and influences codon usage in various organisms [25]. Other notable determinants of innate CUB are base composition [5], skewness of bases [10], expression level of the gene [77], gene length [17], gene stability, replication [25, 39], translational selection [56], protein secondary structure [77] and hydrophobicity [13]. A previous study showed that variation in the tRNA pool and disparity in isochores of a cell are major determinants of CUB [4, 16].",

In our analysis, we determined the overall base composition and the nucleotide frequency at the third codon position in all of the genomes in Fig. 3. An almost equal proportion of T, A and C (~ 27%) bases was observed, compared to G (~ 20%) base. The overall GC% and AT% were 46.78 and 53.22, respectively, indicating that hepadnavirus genes are AT rich. At the third codon position, T (30.86%) was most frequent, followed by A (27.76%), C (24.10%) and G (17.29%). The overall GC3% and AT3% content was 41.39 and 58.61, respectively, indicating AT richness at the third position across the genomes. GC composition has been reported to be a significant factor influencing codon usage bias across the genomes [79]. Here, GC content was highest in position 1, followed by positions 2 and 3. We found a significant correlation of ENC with the G3 and C3 content, (p < 0.05) (Table 2), indicating influence on the CUB. Our interpretation of nucleotide compositional properties and relative synonymous codon usage values suggests that mutational pressure might have a substantial effect on CUB. We also correlated codon usage with GC3 content and found a few positive and negative correlations between GC-ended codons and GC3 (Fig. 4). These results reveal the variation in codon usage in relation to GC constraints and provide a better understanding of the molecular architecture of genomes of hepadnaviruses [28].",

This suggests that energy is released during the transcription process, resulting in a more stable conformation. Higher energy release might lead to the formation of a less stable structure and thus affect the translation process. Here, we correlated the ENC value with the minimum free energy of each gene and found a non-significant relationship between them, suggesting that the loss of minimum free energy was not related to codon usage bias.

In the present study, the mean ENC value was low, indicating that there is little bias in codon usage in members of the family Hepadnaviridae [10]. A lack of strong CUB is expected to promote efficient usage of more codons and thereby speed up the translation process [32]. Fu reported a lower ENC value in five members of the Herpesviridae family of DNA viruses than in other members of the family [19]. Similarly, the ENC value of 11 human bocavirus isolates was in the range of 40.87 to 48.42, with a mean value 44.45, indicating low CUB [91]. However, low ENC values implying high bias have been reported in several viruses, including Orgyia pseudotsugata nucleopolyhedrovirus and Lymantria dispar nucleopolyhedrovirus [33]. Lower CUB might relate to efficient replication in different cell types with different codon preferences [32].",

Mutation pressure is assumed to play an important role in shaping CUB in some genes if these have a very high content of A and T or G and C [35, 67, 90, 92].

Some mutations are caused by replication errors and methylation. Different fidelities in replication of the leading and lagging strands can also cause strand-specific mutational bias in bacteria [41] and eukaryotes [50]. However, in numerous non-chordate species with a large population size, natural selection acts on the synonymous codon usage pattern [37].

Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between GC12 and GC3 (r = 0.910, p < 0.01), suggesting a directional role of mutation. High mutation pressure leads to evolution. Most viruses have a high evolutionary rate due to large population size, high mutation rate, and short generation time. Viral mutations arise from errors made during replication of the viral genome. The mutation rate is used to determine the amount of genetic variation within a population, and this allows natural selection to operate [51]. A high mutation rate can lead to a higher degree of genetic diversity [59].",

Coding sequences with a low mFE value are weakly folded, and coding sequences with high mFE value are strongly folded. Coding sequences with low mFE values tend to produce more protein than those with high mFE values because strong secondary structure in the mRNA molecule disfavors translation.

The mRNA stability index is another parameter that was used in our analysis to estimate mRNA stability. Our results showed that seven genomes had a positive value (highly stable mRNA), while nine genomes had a negative value (less stable mRNA). A significant correlation was found between the stability index and base composition in hepadnavirus genomes. As the stability of the mRNA molecule has been found to be related to the stability of the protein [27], the stability of gene products can be predicted using the mRNA stability index for the expressed genes. The mRNA stability index can also be used to predict the level of expression of a gene.",

The overall codon usage bias across the genomes was low, indicating high variability in synonymous codon usage in viral genes. Almost equal usage of T, A and C was found, which differed from that of G, and AT richness was found. Three overrepresented codons (TCT, AGA, GGA) and seven underrepresented codons (TCG, AGC, AGT, CCG, CGA, ACG, GCG) were identified. Both mutational pressure and natural selection appear to have shaped the codon usage pattern of genes in hepadnavirus genomes during evolution.",
