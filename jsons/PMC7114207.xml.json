It was first isolated in 1952 in the Makonde Plateau of the southern province of Tanzania (former Tanganyika). The virus transmission cycle requires infection of female mosquitoes via a viraemic bloodmeal taken from a susceptible vertebrate host and, following a suitable extrinsic incubation period, transmission to another vertebrate host during subsequent feeding (Solignat et al., 2009). After an incubation period, most patients suffer from polyarthralgia and myalgia, with a significant impact on their quality of life. Chikungunya fever is characterised by a very high viraemic load and concomitant abnormalities such as pronounced lymphopenia and moderate thrombocytopenia. The rate of asymptomatic cases is lower, and the percentage of infected patients requiring medical attention is higher, than in most other common arboviral infections. After the acute stage, some patients experienced relapse, persistent arthralgia or musculoskeletal pains. Increase of age is the most obvious risk factor associated with severe disease or persistent symptoms in adults, whilst in paediatric populations, newborns have a higher risk of severe disease.",

Analysis of these publications shows that, following a number of studies in the 1960s and 1970s, and in the absence of autochthonous cases in developed countries, the interest of the scientific community remained low (Fig. 1\n). However, in 2005 chikungunya fever unexpectedly re-emerged in the form of devastating epidemics in and around the Indian Ocean. These outbreaks were associated with mutations in the viral genome that facilitated the replication of the virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Since then, nearly 1000 publications on chikungunya fever have been referenced in the PubMed database. The reader is referred to Supplementary Tables 1\u20136 for lists of all WHO outbreak bulletins, ProMED Mail alerts, viral sequences available on GenBank, and PubMed reports of clinical cases and seroprevalence studies.",

The two major vectors of the disease currently identified are Ae. aegypti and since 2006, Ae. albopictus. The important role of Ae. albopictus in recent outbreaks is due to adaptive mutations of the viral genome, in particular the A226V mutation in the E1 glycoprotein, that increase viral replication in this specific vector. Based on the partial E1 structural glycoprotein or complete genomic sequences, three phylogroups of CHIKV (West-African, Asian, and East-Central-South-African) which apparently circulate in regions that display different ecological backgrounds have been identified.",

In sections below we review several drugs which have shown antiviral activity against CHIKV or activity against the inflammatory symptoms associated with CHIKV infection. Treatment of standard presentations of chikungunya fever currently relies on paracetamol/acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Chloroquine is not recommended at the acute phase of the disease. Ribavirin has been used in some severe presentations but very limited information is available to confirm its efficacy. Recent investigations may lead to the identification of new antiviral candidates with a clearly defined mechanism of viral inhibition in cell-based systems and significant activity in animal models. Therapeutic protocols for severe cases may also be established based on specific immunoglobulins or molecules that can interfere with some aspects of the inflammatory response associated with CHIKV infection. For chronic rheumatic manifestation and inflammatory polyarthritis lasting more than 2\u20133 months, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as methotrexate are recommended. As described below, studies in animal models suggest that inflammation, macrophage tissue tropism and local viral persistence are involved in the establishment of chronic disease.",

The name \u201cChikungunya\u201d in the Bantu language of the Makonde people refers to the stooped posture due to the frequent and debilitating joint pain induced during chikungunya fever (Enserink, 2006).

Acidic conditions induce a conformational change in the virus envelope proteins, dissociation of the E2\u2013E1 heterodimers and formation of E1 homotrimers. The E1 trimer is inserted into the target membrane via its hydrophobic fusion peptide and refolds to form a hairpin-like structure.

It begins with attachment (E2 is primarily responsible for interactions with cellular receptors) and fusion of virus particles in the membrane of the host cell. The fusion peptide is located at the tip of the E1 molecule in domain II, close to amino acid 226. However, a CHIKV resistant mutant selected and adapted to growth in the presence of high concentrations of Arbidol (a molecule that typically blocks fusion (Boriskin et al., 2008, Leneva et al., 2009)) included a single amino acid substitution (G407R) localised in the E2 envelope protein (Delogu et al., 2011), suggesting that close cooperation between E1 and E2 proteins is necessary during the fusion process.",

Case reports of immunocompromised patients have described atypical and severe disease but no studies have compared immunocompromised or immunodefficient patients. The association between viral load and acute severe illness is controversial. Indeed, several studies reported higher viral load in hospitalised patients or patients with severe illness whilst others studies did not reveal significant association between the viral load and the clinical presentation. Other biological abnormalities or immunological markers have been proposed to be associated with disease severity such as elevated liver enzyme, creatinine, C reactive protein (CRP), hypocalcemia, elevated IL-1\u03b2 or IL-6, decreases in RANTES or early CHIKV-specific IgG3.",

However, the evidence for long lasting persistence of the Asian genotype (see infra) and several recent studies suggest that sylvatic cycles could also play a part in the transmission of CHIKV in Asia (Powers et al., 2000, Apandi et al., 2009).",

Whilst infection of nonhuman primates (which may act as reservoir or amplifying hosts) has been demonstrated (see section below on pathogenesis), and the virus identified in a variety of sylvatic mosquitoes (see previous sections) the determinants or emergence remain poorly understood. In both Africa and Asia, outbreaks were reported to be unpredictable, with an interval of 7\u201320 years between individual epidemics (Powers and Logue, 2007) and an interval of 4\u20135 decades between major epidemics. Whilst the precise factors underlying this pattern are unknown, it is probable that, in addition to a variety of ecological and viral genetic factors and given the long lasting immune protection acquired after chikungunya infection, the immune status of the populations plays a central role in the periodicity of recurrence. This is in coherence with the observation that recurrent outbreaks prefentially target the youngest age-groups (i.e., non immunised during the previous epidemics) (Robert et al., 1996).",

It is probable that the first documented case reported in Bangkok in 1958 reflected more ancient circulation of CHIKV in the region, thus explaining the extent of genetic divergence between the East-Central-South-African (ECSA) and Asian genotypes. According to Ng et al. (Ng and Hapuarachchi, 2010) the availability of historical clinical records suggestive of chikungunya fever outbreaks in Asia since 1779 suggests the independent evolution of an African ancestor of CHIKV in Asia for several centuries, resulting in the Asian genotype. However, this is difficult to accommodate with the most recent estimates of CHIKV evolutionary rates since the most recent ancestor of the Asian and ECSA genotypes is placed at the beginning of the 20th century (Cherian et al., 2009, Volk et al., 2010). Alternately if the report of chikungunya fever in Jakarta in 1779 is exact, it may implicate a limited importation of CHIKV from Africa, the installation of the Asian genotype occurring later (possibly at the end of the 19th century).",

As noted (Ng and Hapuarachchi, 2010), whilst the ECSA genotype has been taking centre stage in the recent Asian outbreaks, the Asian lineage has not faded into oblivion, with recent cases reported in Malaysia (Kumarasamy et al., 2006), Singapore (Ng and Hapuarachchi, 2010) and Taiwan (Huang et al., 2009) (see also Fig. 6). The long-standing persistence of the Asian genotype, and the recent isolation of an Asian genotype strain from wild macaque monkeys in Malaysia (Apandi et al., 2009) are evocative of a sylvatic maintenance which remains to be further documented (Powers et al., 2000).

Despite the abundance of Ae. mosquitoes in most of these areas, there was no evidence for significant autochthonous transmission of CHIKV.

There is strong epidemiological and experimental evidence that this is an adaptive mutation that increases the viral replication in Ae. albopictus (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007). This mutation was reported to have occured independently in different geographical locations and in different genetic backgrounds within the ECSA genotype (see the case of Gabonese strains in (de Lamballerie et al., 2008)). It represents an exellent example of convergent evolution (in the amino acid position 226) by different strains of CHIKV (de Lamballerie et al., 2008). However, it must be noted that the original, non-mutated Ae. aegypti-adapted strain was extremely efficiently transmitted in the regions where this mosquito was prevalent, with seroprevalences reaching more than 60% in Grande Comore and Lamu ismands (see previous sections). Accordingly, it has been proposed that the emergence of the epidemic virus was linked with an initial adaptation to urban domestic Ae. aegypti mosquitoes (Ng and Hapuarachchi, 2010), a postulation further supported by compelling evidence of the urban transmission of the ECSA genotype of CHIKV in central Africa during the past decade (Pages et al., 2009).",

Despite its apparent high frequency, the A226V adaptative evolution did not occur in all CHIKV genetic backgrounds (it was limited to strains belonging to the ECSA genotype) and a complex pattern of other mutations may have been implicated in CHIKV adaptation to a specific Ae. spp. vector (Tsetsarkin et al., 2011a, Tsetsarkin et al., 2009). In particular, the E2-I211T substitution is suspected to have provided the background rendering possible the A226V mutation. It was reported to occur independently on three occasions (South Africa, 1976; Gabon, 2007; Kenya, 2004).

These models and their derivatives (IFN-\u03b1 pathway defective mice) (Rudd et al., 2012)) have provided information about the innate immune response against alphaviruses and have been used for drug testing, since mortality rate and organ viral load can be used as convenient indicators of antiviral activity. (Couderc et al., 2009). The use of various mutants of IFN-\u03b1 pathway defective mice enabled the mechanisms of the innate immune response specific to CHIKV to be deciphered (Couderc et al., 2008, Gardner et al., 2012, Schilte et al., 2012, Schilte et al., 2010, Werneke et al., 2011) implicating roles for Myd88, ISG15, IRF-3 and IRF-7 or viperine (Teng et al., 2012).

Suhrbier and collaborators provided a model of chikungunya rheumatic disease in 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice by shifting the site of injection to the dorsal side of the footpad (Gardner et al., 2010). This subcutaneous (sc) injection route provided histological evidence of acute and persistence arthritis, tenosynovitis and myositis at the infected footpad, similar to that observed in RRV infected mice (Rulli et al., 2009, Rulli et al., 2011). The acute phase was characterised by one-week viral replication peaking at 106\n CCID50/ml and clear swelling and oedema of the inoculated foot (Gardner et al., 2010, Morrison et al., 2011). Tissue viral replication was detectable from day 1 to 21 in muscle, spleen lymph node and liver. In addition, in this adult mouse model, it was shown that mice initially infected with RRV are partially protected from superinfection with the CHIKV LR-2006 OPY-1 strain inoculated 4 weeks later. In mice, young age remained a factor of severity of the disease as is also observed in human babies but mechanisms of neurological disease are not perfectly compatible with these observations. Following intranasal infection of BALB/C or C57BL/6J mice, direct tissue necrosis is observed in the olfactory lobe but no direct infection of neurones was found (Teo et al., 2012). Finally in a recent study using IRF3/7(\u2212/\u2212) mice, it was demonstrated that inadequate IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responses following virus infection can be sufficient to induce haemorrhagic fever and shock, a finding with possible implications for understanding severe CHIKV disease (Rudd et al., 2012).",

Very early in the history of CHIKV studies it was found that NHP are susceptible to infection and are probably part of the natural reservoir in Africa and Asia (Inoue et al., 2003, Marchette et al., 1978, McCrae et al., 1971, Peiris et al., 1993). In field epidemiological studies in Central Africa (Central African Republic, Gabon) Cercopithecus and baboon monkeys have been used as sentinels to assess the presence of arboviruses in the wild (Saluzzo et al., 1980, Saluzzo et al., 1981, Saluzzo et al., 1982). African green monkeys and macaques were also used as sentinels for estimation of vector efficacy of different mosquito species (Jupp et al., 1981, Levitt et al., 1986, Turell and Beaman, 1992, Turell and Malinoski, 1992). These studies led to the identification of the major relevance of Ae. spp. in epidemic outbreaks.",

Recently, Roques and collaborators have infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) using Reunion island strains of CHIKV and, by following biomarkers of CHIKV, found that replication was detectable during the first week of infection with a level of replication similar to human infection (Labadie et al., 2010). Performing in vivo titrations they demonstrated that as little as 10 pfu given IV, could produce infection in macaques, with viremic levels up to 108\n pfu/ml being detected. At day 4 postinfection (pi) CHIKV is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of all tested macaques but clinical neurological disease is detected only in macaques receiving the highest infectious doses. Interestingly, the acute infection seemed to be tightly controlled by poorly-characterised antiviral mechanisms given that the viral titre was reduced to basal levels at day 10 postinfection as described in humans or mice (Ziegler et al., 2008). These viral replication profiles were also recorded in rhesus macaques (Akahata et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2010).",

These infected monocytes generate new viruses, which can be detected using HEK293 cells and titration assays, albeit at low levels (Her et al., 2010). Similarly, CHIKV can infect primary macrophages in vitro (Rinaldo et al., 1975, Sourisseau et al., 2007b) resulting in the production of highly variable amounts of virus, from 103 to 106\n pfu/ml, regardless of the species being used for the studies (human, macaque, mouse) (Gardner et al., 2010, Labadie et al., 2010, Sourisseau et al., 2007b) (Fig. 8\n). These results are consistent with human studies, which reported that macrophages are susceptible to CHIKV infection both in vivo and in vitro (Hoarau et al., 2010b, Krejbich-Trotot et al., 2011). The alleviation of chikungunya-associated arthritis and myositis by treatment, with Bindarit, a MCP-1/CCL-2 inhibitor, in mice (Rulli et al., 2011) also strongly suggests that monocytes/macrophages, the main targets in MCP-1/CCL-2 tissue tropism, are central to muscle and joint disease (see below on the treatment section).",

Despite marked weight loss during the first 3 days, vaccinated mice returned to normal values thereafter. However, in the vaccinated animals sacrified at day 5 pi, some microglial oedema was seen in the brains suggesting that immunisation decreased CHIKV-mediated pathology but did not fully protect the brain in the intranasal inoculation model. In contrast, the disease in mice vaccinated with DNA expressing only the CHIKV capsid induced a morbidity picture identical to the control non-immunised mice. Finally Mallilankaraman et al., 2011 tested the immune response induced following this vaccination strategy in four rhesus macaques (5 immunizations). Two weeks later, they detected variable neutralising antibody responses (RNT 80\u20131200) and specific T cell responses (200\u2013500 SFC/106\n PBMCs), but they did not challenge the animals. Thus, all candidate vaccines except one (TSI-GSD-218) have so far only been tested in mice, and the studies have mainly focused on neutralising antibodies and not on cellular responses. From the literature, it is unclear whether any of these vaccines have proceeded into human clinical trials.",

DNA vaccines, thus far, have proved less effective in humans than in other mammals. Live, attenuated alphaviruses are being used as the genetic backbone for vaccines under development by Chiron, Alphavax and others and this approach is the most likely to lead to an effective vaccine with long-lasting immunity for CHIKV. However, it remains to be determined whether the inevitable high development costs of a safe and effective live, attenuated chimaeric vaccine against CHIKV will prove to be a restraining influence.",

Using reverse genetic methods, synonymous mutations were randomly introduced in three regions of around 1.4 kb that encode structural (nsP1 and nsP4) and non-structural (E1\u2013E2) proteins.

The use of several re-encoded regions located throughout the viral genome reduces the likelihood of complete phenotypic reversion due to recombination between wild-type and re-encoded CHIKVs. In addition, the stability of these re-encoded viruses was assessed by serial passaging of these viruses 50 times either in primate or insect cells or in each cell line alternately. The analysis of these passaged viruses showed that it exhibited a stable phenotype, and that the response to codon re-encoding was largely compensatory in nature, with little reversion of mutations.",

In another study, an emerging alphavirus in salmonid aquaculture called Salmonid alphavirus-3 (SAV-3), was sensitive to the preinfection antiviral state induced by IFN-\u03b1, whilst pi antiviral responses or pi treatment with IFN-\u03b1 was not able to limit viral replication (Xu et al., 2010). This is consistent with recent studies in mice, in which it was found that IFN-\u03b1 treatment prevented arthritis due to CHIKV only if given before infection. Since such a situation would not exist in most cases of human infection, IFN-\u03b1 is not likely to prove useful for therapy (Gardner et al., 2010).",

Some viruses enter their target cells by endocytosis in the lysosomal compartment, where the low pH, along with the action of enzymes, disrupts the viral particle, thus liberating the infectious nucleic acid and, in several cases, enzymes necessary for viral replication. For some enveloped viruses, post-translational modification of the envelope glycoproteins also occurs within the endoplasmic and trans-Golgi network vesicles, and involves proteases and glycosyl-transferases, some of which require a low pH. Thus it was shown that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can impair the replication of several viruses by interacting with the endosome-mediated viral entry or the late stages of replication of enveloped viruses (Savarino et al., 2003).",

ARB has been reported to be clinically active against influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses and more recently against HCV (Brooks et al., 2012). In addition to possible immune-modulatory effects, the antiviral activity of ARB could in part be due to its membranotropism. Recent data showed that ARB incorporates into cellular membranes leading to perturbed membrane structures and inhibition of virus mediated fusion. Indeed, it has been shown that ARB was an entry inhibitor of influenza virus infection by stabilizing the influenza HA and preventing the endosomal membrane fusion. Similarly, ARB inhibited the HCV glycoprotein conformational changes needed for the membrane fusion process. A recent study found that ARB was also effective against CHIKV in vitro and it was concluded that ARB interferes with the early stages of CHIKV infection (virus attachment or entry) by targeting the cellular membrane (Delogu et al., 2011).",

Since it was demonstrated that uncleaved glycoprotein precursors induce defects in viral production for other alphaviruses such as SINV and SFV, a recent study tested the hypothesis that an irreversible furin-inhibiting peptide (decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone (dec-RVKR-cmk)) could inhibit CHIKV infection (Ozden et al., 2008). Like other alphaviruses, the envelope glycoproteins of CHIKV are initially produced as precursors that are further cleaved by furin-like proprotein convertases (PCs) (Voss et al., 2010). dec-RVKR-cmk induced in cellulo stronger inhibition of viral infection than chloroquine when added immediately following infection. A combination of both drugs induced an additive effect, which was further enhanced when the drugs were added to the cells before the virus (Ozden et al., 2008).",

SphK1 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer, immunological and inflammatory disorders. SphK1 catalyses the phosphorylated form of sphingosine to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). The SphK1/S1P axis has well described roles in cell signalling, viz., the cell death/survival decision, the production of a pro-inflammatory response, immunomodulation and control of vascular integrity. The authors argued that the clinical picture of chikungunya fever is similar to the painful joint syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accordingly, SphK1/S1P could play a significant role in infections by RNA viruses. Indeed, data suggest that raising S1P systematically, or reducing SphK1 activity and S1P locally in joints, does appear to have beneficial effects in clinical cases of RA. Moreover S1P lyase inhibitors are under investigation for RA",

The fusion peptide is located at the tip of the E1 molecule in domain II, close to amino acid 226. Following virus entry, two rounds of translation occur. Positive-sense genomic RNA acts directly as mRNA and is partially translated (5\u2019 end) to produce non-structural proteins (nsP\u2019s). These proteins are responsible for replication and formation of a complementary negative strand, the template for further positive-strand synthesis. Subgenomic mRNA (26S) replication occurs through the synthesis of full-length negative intermediate RNA, which is regulated by nsP4 and p123 precursor in early infection, and later by mature nsPs. Translation of the 26S sub-genomic RNA results in production of 5 structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6k, E1), which are required for viral encapsidation and budding.
