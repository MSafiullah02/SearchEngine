We investigated all studies up to November 2015 pertaining to quality assessment, discrimination, pharmacological effects, planting or processing, or ecological system of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos. Sixty-five studies mainly discussing about chemical fingerprint, component analysis, planting and processing, discrimination between varieties, ecological system, pharmacological effects, and safety were systematically reviewed. By analyzing these studies, we found that the key points of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos research were quality and application. Further studies should focus on improving the quality by selecting the more superior of all varieties and evaluating clinical effectiveness.",

It will provide significant scientific basis for assessment and control of the quality of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos to make a standard chemical fingerprint. The chemical fingerprint of Chinese herbs is a method used in modern technology under given conditions to analyze the chemical and biological information and expressed in image mode. Chemical fingerprint not only emphasizes the uniqueness of certain herbs but also reflects the similarity of different varieties. It has great advantages with respect to monitoring of the quality of Chinese herbs, and some developed countries have regarded it as standard of quality control. At present, the commonly used methods are HPLC, IR, GC, RRLC, RAPD, and HNMR. Among these methods, HPLC has the most advantages, such as high separation efficiency, high sensitivity, fast analysis speed, and load liquid velocity, which is the main method used in the component analysis and fingerprint creation of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos. These studies show that it is reasonable to distinguish geo-authentic and non-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos.

In the research that focuses mainly on the component analysis, they pointed at the content of chlorogenic acid, which was also the main analyzing component in chemical fingerprint, ecological system, and other research. Chlorogenic acid is the main active component that confirmed as an anti-inflammatory agent. Flavonoid compounds, including galuteolin, are antioxidants that can remove free radicals of ultra oxygen ions in the human body, increase immunity, and has anti-aging effect. In Chinese Materia Medica Grand Dictionary, it also refines the content of noxious substances, such as heavy mental and residual insecticides. The high content of these noxious substances is also an important reason limiting international popularization and application of Chinese herbs. However, few studies involved the assessment of these noxious substances. Thus, further studies should improve this aspect. The content of water, total ash, and volatile oil are also seldom involved, so the studies about geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos should also stress this point.",

From the studies we have searched, we can see that many studies have begun to explore the standardization of planting and processing of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos. The research indicates that the best picking time is sanqing, erbai, and dabai stage, just before the beginning of summer.

First, the varieties of the geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos should be discriminated. Different organs are differently influenced by the environment. The research shows that the color, morphology of buds and leaves, density, and length of non-glandular hair outside the buds are the discrimination point between different varieties. Second, different varieties have different heredity features, which can be discriminated through technologies. From the inclusive research, we can see that the ISSR is the most commonly used method recently. ISSR combines RAPD and SSR labeling technique and has advantages such as simple, rapid, and efficient operation, high genetic diversity, and good repeatability. ISSR can provide more genome DNA information and is often used in germplasm resource discrimination, evolutionary and genetic relationship analysis, and genetic diversity research. Other technologies, such as HPLC, electron probe, RAPD fingerprint, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, are also used. The aim of the discrimination of morphological characteristics and heredity is to select the superior quality of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos; however, until now, no study reports the mode of selection for superior quality and the method to improve the quality. Thus, this point should be strengthened.",

However, scientific data to support it are lacking as we can see little evidence from the studies we searched. The qualities of these two clinical trials are too low, and the studies about its anti-inflammation and antipyretic pharmacologic action are still with animals rather than clinical application. Thus, we should make further investigation to explore the clinical effectiveness of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos. For example, high-quality clinical trials can be conducted to compare the clinical effectiveness between geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and non-authentic ones. Furthermore, geoauthentic herbs that target illness are also important to control quality or develop Chinese herb extracts.",

The factors involve yield and quality. The key point of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos research is the quality and application. However, we are facing many problems such as identifying noxious substances of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, selecting the most superior of all varieties, and evaluating clinical effectiveness. Therefore, further studies should focus on resolving these problems and focus on the application and further development of geo-authentic Lonicerae Japonicae Flos.",
