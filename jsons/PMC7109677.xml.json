            "text": "Detecting Plasmodium parasites in peripheral blood, in both febrile patients and asymptomatic carriers, is essential for any malaria control programme aiming at decreasing local transmission and achieving the pre-elimination status.1 The WHO recently launched a global initiative known as T3 (\u2018Test. Treat. Track.\u2019), aimed at supporting malaria-endemic countries in their efforts to achieve universal coverage with diagnostic testing, antimalarial treatment and surveillance.2 Though malaria has been eliminated from Europe and North America with no other diagnostic tool than microscopy,3 this seems more difficult in tropical countries, including sub-Saharan Africa, because of the substantial number of individuals harbouring a malaria infection at extremely low densities, undetectable by microscopy.4 The currently available tools for diagnosing malaria include microscopy, parasite antigen/enzyme detection kits [commonly referred to as rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)] and molecular tools (discussed in Cordray and Richards-Kortum5), each of them with specific advantages and limitations and with the potential of being deployed at different levels of the health system (microscopy and RDTs more peripherally than molecular tools).5,6 Indeed, microscopy and RDTs remain the only feasible options at health facility or lower level, e.g. community case management of malaria.6 These two diagnostic tools have limitations. For example, the absence of the pfhrp-2 gene (encoding the HRP-2 protein, to which most antigen detection tests are directed) in Plasmodium falciparum populations from some endemic areas resulted in a substantial proportion of false negatives.7 Moreover, both microscopy and RDTs cannot detect parasite densities <100 parasites/\u03bcL, particularly in field conditions, while asymptomatic carriers have a much lower parasite density.8 The latter can be identified by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), often by PCR, one of the most widely used molecular methods for the detection and identification of infectious diseases. The detection limit of PCR, which is \u223c1 parasite/\u03bcL depending on the assay type,9,10 is lower than either RDTs or microscopy and PCR is therefore able to detect asymptomatic malaria carriers who may be targeted for treatment.11 In some settings, asymptomatic sexual and asexual stages of P. falciparum infections may persist and sustain transmission at very low parasite densities, below the threshold of detection by microscopy or RDTs and in reach only of molecular methods such as PCR.12\u201314 However, PCR-based assays are the least feasible to perform in field settings as they are prone to contamination, heavily influenced by the purity of the sample nucleic acid content thus relying on purified extracts and requiring cold storage facilities for reagents.5,15,16 Therefore, until recently, molecular diagnostic methods required specialized equipment and personnel and could not be carried out outside reference facilities. The possibility of amplifying DNA at isothermal temperatures without the need of a thermocycling apparatus has created the opportunity of performing molecular diagnostic tests at a more peripheral level17 and thus of improving the management of infectious diseases, especially in resource-limited settings.15,16,18 Recent guidelines published by WHO recommend that diagnostic devices for resource-limited settings should be ASSURED: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end users.19,20 This paper reviews some molecular isothermal amplification techniques (with the ASSURED criteria in mind) with the aim of determining their possible deployment for high-throughput detection of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers in the field, e.g. in mass screening and treatment campaigns.",

Established isothermal amplification methods have different degrees of complexity (multiple enzymes or primers) and also varying sensitivity and specificity.36 A major advantage of isothermal amplification methods is the simplicity of endpoint determination, often by visual observation, which allows assays to be run in a closed system, thus reducing the risk of post-amplification contamination.20,37,38 The choice of which reaction to use is primarily driven by the target of interest to be amplified. Amplification time, reaction temperature, tolerance to substances in biological samples, length of the target, initial heat denaturation and complexity (i.e. the number of enzymes and primers required) are all factors to be considered when choosing an appropriate method.39 In the past two decades, several isothermal amplification methods for detecting pathogens, including malaria parasites, have been used (Table 1).\n",

A cocktail of three enzymes (reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase and RNase H) acting in concert allows the rapid amplification of target sequences by >108-fold without the use of expensive thermal-cycling equipment, the end product being a single-stranded RNA antisense to the original RNA template.65 Since there is no DNA denaturation step in NASBA, contaminating genomic or proviral DNA (the precursor or latent form of a virus integrated into the genetic material of a host cell) is not amplified. However, the extent of the reaction cannot be controlled by adjusting the number of cycles and the likelihood of non-specific interactions is increased because the amplification temperature cannot exceed 41\u00b0C without the risk of enzymatic denaturation.66",

The two newly synthesized double-stranded DNA products are subsequently used as substrates by DNA helicases, entering the next round of the reaction. Thus, a simultaneous chain reaction proceeds, resulting in the exponential amplification of the selected target sequence.71 tHDA amplifies nucleic acid targets efficiently at 65\u00b0C and requires fewer protein components than the mesophilic HDA platform, which is performed at 37\u00b0C.72 However, because both methods are isothermal and do not require thermocycling, they present a relatively cheaper platform than PCR.\n",
