The latter is principally recognized by the requirement for respiratory support, culminating in pressure ventilation, at which point the prognosis is poor, with most secumbing to the disease via the paroxysmal cessation of gas exchange, and the pathophysiologic signature of irreversible demise, treatment refractory hypoxic-ischemia.

To illustrate, we have prepared two scenarios as \u2018call out boxes\u2019 which contain an abbreviated vignette, followed by our specific plans of intervention [Vignette Box 1, Vignette Box 2\n]. The goals for each scenario are to mitigate suffering, promote reconstitution of network immune coordinate regulation sufficient to prevent PANIC, but also to recognize and urgently treat PANIC when the features that define it are recognized by our front-line workers.Vignette Box 1Treatment algorithm for mild-moderate severity of COVID-19. \u2018Left-shifting\u2019 for prevention of PANIC.A telemedicine visit involved a 31-year-old woman with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, treated with dimethyl fumarate at 240 mg po bid, who was \u2018sheltering in place\u2019 and awoke one morning with new onset fever (Tmax = 101.4 deg.

With head flexion or hip flexion while laying supine and attempting to straighten the leg, there is no increased head pain to suggest meningeal root irritation (Brudsinski and Kernig signs respectively were absent). Conspicuously, and on an unsolicited basis, she describes the relatively sudden loss of smell followed by taste sensation.Based upon the constellation of symptoms, we were suspicious of COVID-19 and I asked the patient to be seen at her local ER for testing (either with RT-PCR or with CT chest imaging to reveal characteristic peripherally based ground-glass lesions; findings with 98% sensitivity compared to the ~70% sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay). While the ER physician's diagnosis was COVID-19, no confirmatory testing was performed. However, laboratory testing did reveal lymphopenia (absolute number of 250), a CRP of 2.75, normal D-Dimer, and she was discharged to home.Over subsequent days, and nearly daily telemedicine conference calls, it was evident that her flu-like symptoms persisted, if not intensifying (cough, perception of reduced negative inspiratory force (NIF), persistent fever, and the perception of chest tightness). A series of recommendations were made in an attempt to both mitigate symptoms, but also to potentially reduce the induction of the SARS-CoV-2 induced PANIC Attack.\nAlt-text: Vignette Box 1Vignette Box 2Prevention, mitigation, or abolishment of the SARS-CoV-2 triggered PANIC.A 55-year-old University School of Medicine hospital physician intensivist, and unit Director, has been carefully and systematically managing mild, moderate, and severely affected COVID-19 patients since March 15, 2020. During this time he has consistently utilized PPE consisting of gloves, disposable gown, N95 masks with facial shields, and head and shoe covers. On April 22, his unit is visited by a senior member of the COVID-19 Federal Safety Task Force, refuses to wear a mask of any type, so that he is certain to \u2018express his abundant respect by not covering his face while he offers his congratulations to the unit Director, as the visit was orchestrated to recognize the heroic efforts of this senior faculty member, in the management of the most severe cases of COVID-19 in the region. The conversation between the two men is at a distance of about 3\u20134 ft from each other. In a lapse in judgment the unit Director removes his mask in order to exhibit his respect for the senior task force representative.Within 24 h, the unit Director has developed a fever of 101.4 F, a dry, non-productive cough, chest discomfort with inspiration, profound fatigue and malaise, increased work of breathing, myalgias and exercise intolerance. Laboratory assessment reveals elevated D-Dimer, a CRP of 3.75, CK of 1500, lymphopenia (absolute number = 400), ferritin of 700, and an O2 saturation of 88%.

Further, low-dose weekly MTX (7.5 to 25 mg taken po weekly along with 2 mg of folate daily) could be utilized in those patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, but who persist or exhibit what appears to represent a more protracted and slowly advancing clinical deterioration. When compared to our HDMTX-LR intervention, low dose weekly oral MTX is not as prolific, nor as rapidly acting to exact remission.

            "text": "Fig. 1: Methotrexate has been recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the \u2018essential medications\u2019, principally due to its broad diversity of mechanisms of action, whether utilized at low doses for purposes of taking advantage of its dynamic range of anti-inflammatory mechanisms (particularly beneficial in the management of rheumatoid arthritis), or at high doses to eradicate a range of malignancies, or in circumstances of fulminant inflammatory conditions where conventional approaches have been futile. In this figure we emphasize the pleiotropic and discretely targeted actions of high-dose methotrexate, as a hypothetical intervention for the SARS-CoV-2 triggered PANIC Attack. The viral infection will produce the severe variant of COVID-19, principally secondary to the simultaneous activation of the diverse limbs of the human immune network (Fig. 1). As such, productive therapeutic strategies are likely those which either combine different agents which target distinctly different mechanisms of immune activation, or we need to identify novel or existing monotherapies which are endowed with a diversity of actions capable of counteracting the PANIC Attack triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 agent in those afflicted with the severe variant of the disease. In A) we showcase methotrexate as a potent inhibitor of the folate-dependent enzyme systems, especially those which are essential in rapidly dividing cells; such as those of the hyper-activated immune system, given that the cell cycle synthesis (S) phase requires nucleoside precursors for the synthesis of both DNA and RNA by the de novo pathways; and as such for RNA replication of the SARS-CoV-2 agent. Other body cells overcome this base synthesis blockade by utilizing the so-called salvage pathways, where partially assembled and partially broken down bases can be utilized to complete the synthesis; which are not available to rapidly dividing cells and microbes such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. MTX is polyglutamated following entry into cells, a molecular modification which serves to prevent its efflux back out of the cell. Once inside this form of the molecule effectively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase among other folate dependent enzyme systems, which ultimately inhibits the de novo biosynthetic pathways for purines and pyrimidines (necessary for both DNA and RNA); and as such it reduces RNA replication of the virus. In B) at 1:00 we illustrate the inhibitory effects of MTX on multiple transmembrane signaling pathways involved in inflammation, including the JAK-STAT pathways that are activated by a host of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, GM-CSF, and IFN\u03b3. At 2:00 we illustrate the role of the NF\u03baB signaling pathway for a series of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and for matrix matalloproteases. MTX inhibits the production of these inflammatory mediators, but also liberates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which then engages JNK activation, which then can promote p53 activity which represents the final NF\u03baB sequence inhibitor (thereby blocking the effector functions of proinflammatory cytokines). Further JNK activation also activates the c-Fos and c-Fun pathways which culminate in the gene expression of pro-apoptotic gene expression and increased sensitivity to apoptosis. In C) we illustrate the effect of MTX in its ability to block HMGB1 to the RAGE receptor, and thereby aborting the multiple downstream immune effector injury mechanisms that converge to destroy the lung alveoli in severe COVID-19. The attenuation of immune cell maturation, migration and transmigration across the alveoli epithelia (utilizing matrix metalloproteinases which digest fibronectin, collagen, and other matrix elements that constitute the integrity of tissue elements), and the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by either active release mechanisms, or via the passive release secondary to the expulsion from damaged or dying cells (a process referred to as pyroptosis; inflammatory apoptosis) are additional alveolar injury pathways that are blocked by MTX. In D) we emphasize a series of risk mitigation interventions that are crucial when using HDMTX-LR (all of which are further discussed in the text).",
