Methods The univariable and multivariable analysis were computed to identify the independent predictors of COVID-19 progression. The prediction model was established in a retrospective training set of 322 COVID-19 patients and was reevaluated in a prospective validation set of 317 COVID-19 patients. Results The multivariable analysis identified age (OR = 1.061, p = 0.028), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR = 1.006, p = 0.037), and CD4 count (OR = 0.993, p = 0.006) as the independent predictors of COVID-19 progression. Consequently, the age-LDH-CD4 algorithm was derived as (age \u00d7 LDH)/CD4 count. In the training set, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of age-LDH-CD4 model was significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively). In the prospective validation set, the AUROC of age-LDH-CD4 model was also significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.75, 0.81, and 0.82, respectively). The age-LDH-CD4 \u2265 82 has high sensitive (81%) and specific (93%) for the early identification of COVID-19 patients with severe progression tendency. Conclusions The age-LDH-CD4 model is a simple algorithm for early identifying patients with severe progression tendency following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and warrants further validation.",

The AUROC of age-LDH-CD4 model was significantly higher than that of CD4 count, LDH, and age. In the training set, the AUROC of age-LDH-CD4 model was significantly higher than that of CD4 (p = 0.005), LDH (p = 0.025), and age (p < 0.001). In the prospective validation set, the AUROC of age-LDH-CD4 model was also significantly higher than that of CD4 (p = 0.021), LDH (p = 0.027), and age (p = 0.028) [3] [4] [5] . However, there is still a lack on clinically available method for early identifying COVID-19 patients with severe progression tendency, which is important for regulating the large flow of patients between primary health care and tertiary centers. Patients without severe progression tendency can be treated in primary health care, whereas those had severe progression tendency needed to be redirected to tertiary centers for specialized care and treatment. This study developed a simple algorithm, named age-LDH-CD4 model, to early identify COVID-19 patients with severe progression tendency. The age-LDH-CD4 model based on three routine parameters: age, LDH, and CD4 count. In this study, the age-LDH-CD4 model \u2265 82 has high sensitive (81%) and specific (93%) for the early identification of COVID-19 progression. The NPV of the age-LDH-CD4 model is 98% for predicting COVID-19 progression, suggesting just 2% of patients with age-LDH-CD4 < 82 developed to severe cases in the training set. In the prospective validation set, 2 patients had the age-LDH-CD4 model \u2265 82 on admission, 1 patient (50%) developed to severe cases during the hospitalization. In the prospective validation set, 315 patients had the age-LDH-CD4 model < 82 on admission, and only 1 patient (0.3%) developed to severe cases. That is to say, over 99% of patients with age-LDH-CD4 model < 82 will not progress to severe cases, and can be managed at primary health care or district hospitals. About 50% of patients with age-LDH-CD4 model \u2265 82 will progress to severe cases, and can benefit from early transfer to tertiary centers.",

In 2004, Li et al. [15] reported that peripheral T lymphocyte subsets can facilitate an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of SARS. Therefore, at the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, lymphocyte subsets were routinely measured for COVID-19 patients in this study. Besides our study, Chen and colleagues found that increased lymphopenia (in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), and decreased IFN-\u03b3 expression in CD4+ T cells are associated with severe COVID-19 [16] . In the issue of the Clinical Infectious Disease, Wang and colleagues also found that CD4+ T cells decreased in COVID-19 patients, and severe cases had a lower level than mild cases [17] .

The possible reasons for the lower severe rate and fatality rate are as follows. First, the control measures (early discovery, early isolation, early diagnosis, and early management) have been undertaken, and enough health workers and medical services have been provided at the early time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai, China. Second, all imported persons were tested with PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 before they were released from quarantine. As a result, nearly all of the COVID-19 cases were diagnosed at earlier stages of disease.
