Particles with da > 10 \u03bcm generally do not reach the alveolar region, and those in the 2 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm range reach the alveolar region with variable efficiency.(5) Indeed, the idea of droplet nuclei involvement in airborne infection assumes that the alveolar region is the target site.(1) Because the density of a respiratory particle should be close to that of water, we will make no distinction between the physical and aerodynamic diameter. We note evidence that M. tuberculosis bacilli when carried on particles with da = 2 \u03bcm are one to two orders of magnitude more infective than when carried on particles with da \u2248 12 \u03bcm.(6) More extreme is the case of Streptococcus Group C bacteria, which show an inhalation LD50 in mice of 200 when carried on particles with da = 2 \u03bcm, compared with an inhalation LD50 of 20 \u00d7 106 when carried on particles with da = 12 \u03bcm.(7) Still, it is invalid to broadly assert that respirable particles are required to transmit infection via inhalation, because for some pathogens the upper respiratory tract may be a target tissue. For example, there is evidence that subsequent to inhalation exposure to variola virus (smallpox) and Yersinia pestis bacilli (pneumonic plague), primary infection can occur in either the alveolar region or the upper respiratory tract.(8\u201311)",

The concentration also depends on the size of the pathogen and its degree of aggregation. For example, if some fraction of organisms is associated with approximately spherical clusters of diameter 20 \u03bcm, these clusters cannot be carried by particles with da \u2264 10 \u03bcm; in this case, the pathogen concentration (number per mL) in respiratory particles with da \u2264 10 \u03bcm will be less than the pathogen concentration in the original respiratory fluid.",

As will be discussed, however, there are problems with using the lognormal model for respiratory particle diameters. In the alternative, we use a nonparametric method to estimate V20.

If a particle of respiratory fluid containing glycoprotein in addition to ions were to retain water to a proportionate degree, the equilibrium diameter of the incompletely desiccated particle would be deq = (1.19) \u00d7 (0.44 d0) = 0.52 \u00d7 d0. Using a similar adjustment over the typical range of indoor RH (30% to 70%), the equilibrium diameter would range from 0.47 \u00d7d0 (30% RH) to 0.61 \u00d7d0 (70% RH). Given uncertainty in the estimate, we use the approximation deq = 0.5 \u00d7 d0 for our subsequent discussion.

These time scales vary from many seconds to a few hours for typical indoor settings. If the evaporation rate is much faster than each of the other processes, then the details of the rate need not be considered and one can reasonably treat the new equilibrium as being attained instantaneously.

The former contain no particles with diameters greater than 8 \u03bcm, while the latter two data sets contain many particles with diameters greater than 100 \u03bcm. This discrepancy is important because in the Duguid and L&R distributions, particles with diameters greater than 8 \u03bcm contain more than 99.9% of the aerosol volume (and therefore more than 99.9% of the pathogens) emitted. The absence of large particles from the data reported by Papineni and Rosenthal signifies that the potential pathogen emission rate would be several orders of magnitude lower than suggested by the other two data sets. The deficit of large particles in the Papineni and Rosenthal study may be a result of limitations in quantitatively sampling these particles using OPCs. Although OPCs can size particles up to 10 \u03bcm and larger, sampling and transmission losses become progressively more important with size for particles larger than about 2 \u03bcm.(18,19) Moreover, we judge the results of a bioaerosol study described below to be inconsistent with the particle size data offered by Papineni and Rosenthal, but consistent with the Duguid and L&R data.",

An alternative explanation is that coughing emits far fewer particles (and pathogens) than does sneezing, and that the study design was not sufficiently sensitive to quantify the numbers of pathogens in large versus small particles emitted by coughing. According to Duguid, a sneeze releases 200-fold more particles than does a cough, such that three sneezes emit fiftyfold more particles than do 12 coughs. Most sneeze subjects also had higher concentrations of streptococci in saliva than did cough subjects; the respective median values were 4.3 \u00d7 105 mL\u2212 1 versus 1.6 \u00d7 105 mL\u2212 1.

First, Duguid increased the observed diameters of the smaller particles by fourfold to account for evaporative water loss, whereas we have argued that a twofold increase is more appropriate, or d0 = 2 \u00d7deq. Second, owing to the lack of detail provided in Duguid's paper, we cannot discern what percentage of the particles in each of the first five diameter ranges in Table II were inappropriately size-adjusted by this factor of four. In contrast, the only adjustment applied by Louden and Roberts involved correcting for the slight spreading of the larger particles when impacting onto the bond paper; they did not adjust for evaporative water loss. Third, Duguid's data involved an unspecified number of subjects and an unspecified number of coughs in the range 10 to 22, whereas the L&R data involved observations known to be from three subjects and 90 coughs. Finally, another study in which cough particles were photographically enumerated reported that a cough releases on the order of several hundred particles.(21) This estimate is in line with the L&R data but is an order of magnitude less than Duguid's particle count.",

However, air sampling was commenced 30 min after a subject coughed into the chamber, and in that 30-min interval a large fraction of particles with deq < 10 \u03bcm should have deposited onto the bond paper. For example, a particle with a 5 \u03bcm equilibrium diameter has a terminal settling velocity of 2.8 m h\u22121. Given that the chamber height was 0.3 m, we would expect nearly all 5 \u03bcm particles to have settled onto the bond paper prior to the air sampling. The assay method was apparently not a factor since the same light microscopy technique with a resolving power of 0.5 \u03bcm was used to examine the bond paper and Millipore filters. We cannot resolve the discrepancy, which leaves open the possibility that the L&R cough data underestimate the number of particles with initial diameters less than 20 \u03bcm, and thereby lead to underestimating the value of V20.",

Unfortunately, the deviations from the expected cumulative percentile line for the L + R data in Figure 1 visually indicate that a lognormal distribution model does not provide a good fit. In the alternative, we found that a mixture of two lognormal distributions provides a better fit. As before, in estimating the GM and GSD parameters, it was assumed that all of the emitted particles were observed. For the adjusted L&R particle diameters (2 \u00d7 reported value), the mixture model indicates there is a count distribution of \u201csmall\u201d emitted particles with GM = 9.8 \u03bcm and GSD = 9.0, and a count distribution of \u201clarge\u201d emitted particles with GM = 160 \u03bcm and GSD = 1.7. The former distribution contains 71% of all the cough particles, while the latter distribution contains 29%. For the adjusted L&R data, Figure 2 depicts the cumulative percentile by count versus initial particle diameter. The straight line shows the expected cumulative percentiles given a two-parameter lognormal distribution model with GM = 24 \u03bcm and GSD = 8.4, whereas the dashed curve shows the expected cumulative percentiles given a weighted mixture of the two lognormal distributions just described.\n",

The first is the aforementioned problem of the lower truncation of observed equilibrium diameter particles at 1 \u03bcm. If submicron diameter particles represent a substantial fraction of the particle count in emitted respiratory aerosol, then the estimated parameters of the mixture model for the diameter count distribution could be substantially biased. The second problem is that the combination of GSD = 9.0 for the \u201csmall\u201d particle distribution, and the unbounded right tail of a lognormal distribution, leads to predicting an impossible aerosol volume. Given 470 particles in a cough, the fitted parameters correspond to an aerosol volume per cough of 450 mL.",

At the same time, we offer the following comment. If an upper particle size limit were assumed, one could apply a bounded distribution such as a beta distribution or a mixture of beta distributions to model the count distribution of particle diameters. For small particles below the detection limit, if there was independent information on the volume of aerosol emitted in a cough, one might apply constrained maximum likelihood or Bayesian techniques to extrapolate the estimated diameter count distribution to these small particle sizes. In general, the particular question of interest should dictate the class of statistical model that is used. If the interest is infection via inhalation, only particles with equilibrium diameters less than 100 \u03bcm are relevant, and thus the appropriate models should give optimal estimates of the distribution in that range, for example, distributions with natural boundaries such as beta distributions or other truncated distributions. If extrapolation beyond the data is of primary interest, a different class of models is warranted. For all such estimation problems, given a particular subset of candidate models, model selection techniques such as density-based cross-validation should be used to pick the model best supported by the data.",

In a WMR, particles are instantaneously and uniformly mixed throughout the air of the room. Although mixing requires finite time, the WMR model reasonably estimates exposure intensity for persons not near the emission source, and the widely used Wells-Riley model for M. tuberculosis infection assumes the WMR construct.(6,22) We note that if infection by large nonrespirable particles (e.g., deq = 50 \u03bcm) were considered, relying on the WMR dispersion model would be inappropriate. The reason is that large particles have a terminal settling velocity sufficiently high to cause most to settle out of room air close to the release point; because large particles do not disperse throughout room air, exposure intensity to pathogens carried on large particles (and hence, infection risk) is extremely sensitive to a person's location in the room relative to the emission source.",

In addition, the WMR construct ignores the higher exposure intensity (and higher infection risk) that would pertain close to the emission source.(34,35) We also note that our hypothetical G = 3 h\u2212 1 is not so different from the mean respirable M. tuberculosis emission rate of 1.25 h\u2212 1, and falls within the emission rate range of 0 to 60 h\u2212 1, as reported by Riley and colleagues for a series of pulmonary TB patients as biologically assayed with guinea pigs.(36) In fact, the pathogen emission rates reported by Riley are underestimates because they did not account for a pulmonary deposition fraction less than one for the bacilli inhaled by guinea pigs.",

For example, among the 96 pulmonary TB patients who were studied for cough frequency, one-half coughed 3 times per hour or less, but two patients coughed more than 48 times per hour.(29) In the previous scenario, a five-fold increase in CF to 2.5 \u00d7 107 mL\u2212 1, a five-fold increase in cough frequency E to 50 h\u2212 1, and a five-fold increase in V20 to 3 \u00d7 10\u2212 7 mL, would yield G = 370 h\u2212 1, CAV = 5 m\u2212 3, and \u03bc = 1.

The corresponding volume for a sneeze is 1.2 \u00d7 10\u2212 5 mL. We stress that these are rough estimates, and confirming their validity would require new experimental research efforts. Given these numbers however, if information is available on the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid and the rate of expiratory events, an average emission rate for pathogens carried on respirable particles can be estimated. With further information on the room air supply rate and resistance of aerosolized pathogen to environmental stress, a simple well-mixed room model may be used to estimate the respirable pathogen concentration in general room air. In turn, infection risk for a susceptible room occupant is a function of the expected pulmonary dose, which depends on the airborne concentration, breathing rate, exposure duration, the alveolar particle deposition fraction for different particles sizes, and the infectious dose.",
