To date, COVID-19 lacks a specific treatment to counteract the onset of SARS and subsequent multiorgan failure, whose evolution is usually rapid and severe. Liang and collaborators recently described an increased risk of COVID-19 among patients with cancer, which is also associated with a poorer COVID-19 prognosis [2] . Thus, international panels have recommended to delay or suspend anticancer treatments, when feasible, raising the issue of potential cancer progressions [3, 4] . Concerning oncogene-addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, outcomes are strongly influenced by the continuous administration of targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Thus, the withdrawal of TKI might be detrimental in this subgroup of patients. This becomes even more relevant when a pulmonary infection by SARS-CoV-2 is diagnosed accidentally in asymptomatic patients. Herein, we present two cases of oncogene-driven NSCLC patients suspected infected by SARS-CoV-2 who maintained targeted therapy with ALK/ROS1 TKIs in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia and recovered from infection without specific antiviral treatments.",

All the symptoms resolved on March 29 th and did not require further medications. CT scan performed on March 30 th , after two cycles of alectinib, showed partial response of disease and, collaterally, the onset of slight bilateral subpleuric ground-glass opacities ( Figure 1 ). Due to the lack of symptoms the patient was discharged without any specific medication and alectinib was continued. The test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on RT-PCR on April 4 th , and the result was negative.

Since the beginning, the treatment was well tolerated and the patient achieved metabolic complete response of thoracic disease with decrease of brain lesions in January 2019, which was still documented at the last radiological assessment performed in February 2020. On the 9 th of March 2020, the patient reported fever (until 39\u00b0 C) and dry cough, which worsened in the subsequent three days. After the admission to Emergency Service, a High-Resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the thorax (March 12 th ) showed the onset of multiple bilateral ground glass opacities, with a crazy paving pattern (Figure 2A ). RT-PCR performed on March 13 th was negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was treated with antibiotic treatment with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for 10 days since March 12 th , and lorlatinib treatment was not discontinued. Six days after the beginning of antibiotic therapy, the symptoms were improved and the patient was weaned completely off oxygen supply. C-reactive protein values, which were high at the time of admission to the hospital (49 mg/L), were normalized on March 20 th (3 mg/L). Due to remission of symptoms, the patient was discharged on March 23 rd . A new CT scan performed on April 9 th showed complete resolution of interstitial pneumonia ( Figure 2B ).",

Indeed, a not negligible rate of false negative results has been documented when assessing by RT-PCR, considering that this method heavily rely on the presence of viral genome at the site of sample collection and is operator-dependent [5] .",

Since the radiological patterns of COVID-19 are evocative but not always diriment, a multidisciplinary discussion with radiologists is advisable in this subgroup of patients, and CT scan findings must be necessarily correlated with clinical and laboratory features. Even though the COVID-19 outcome in our patients who continued TKIs was favorable, we could not draw definitive conclusions. Large scale studies are urgently needed to assess whether or not TKIs should be maintained during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, especially when not severe, in order to avoid potentially-dangerous withdrawal of effective anticancer drugs.",
