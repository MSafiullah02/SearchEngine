Types of cells formed as a result of in vivo or ex vivo fusion can be divided depending on the number and origin of nuclei in the fused cell as well as the type of cells that underwent fusion (Fig. 72.1). Fusion cells can be generated in a homotypic (fusion of cells of the same type) or heterotypic (fusion of cells of different types) fashion [4]. Cells originating from fusion of two different types are known as hybrid cells. Following fusion, cells may contain either one nucleus (synkaryon- created by nuclear fusion) or two or more nuclei (heterokaryon by cytoplasmatic fusion). During the fused cell\u2019s life-time, if both nuclei divisions synchronize, cell can transform from a heterokaryon to a synkaryon cell.\n",

The work of pioneers such as Terada [8] and Ying [9] revealed that cells created by spontaneous CF could express phenotype characteristics of undifferentiated cells or properties of both types of cells undergoing fusion. The possibility of formation of stable multinucleated heterokaryons as a result of spontaneous fusion of bone marrow derived cells with several types of fusion friendly cells such as: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver, monocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells/progenitor cells, macrophages, B and T lymphocytes, intestine cells, and Purkinje neurons was confirmed by multiple in vivo studies [6, 15\u201325]. In these experiments fused cells not only presented mixed phenotype, but also overtook the function of the injured recipient cells and helped facilitate the process of tissue regeneration. The interest in application of bone marrow derived cells in various medical fields such as tissue regeneration and transplantation is increasing due to their potential therapeutic effects.",

            "text": "In the early 1960s, in vitro CF was performed to describe the effect of viruses such as hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) on murine cell cultures [26\u201328]. Currently, there are three major CF methods: chemical, electrical, and viral. Advantages and disadvantages of each method were compiled and are presented in Table 72.1. New methods of CF applying different agents such as cephalin, bispecific nanoparticles, fusogenic cell lines, or v-fusion are investigated [29\u201332]. Combining different fusion methods and introducing additional modifications of conventional techniques have been studied to improve the fusion efficacy, either by increasing the cell-to-cell contact capability or permeabilization area. The selection of proper fusion method and protocol optimization depends on the cell type, cell number, culture conditions (monolayer vs. cell suspension), their sensitivity to unfavorable conditions, and equipment availability. The efficacy of polykaryons creation can be controlled by factors such as time and/or fusing agent concentration. Higher numbers of polykaryons can be also generated by repeating the fusion procedure [33]. Additionally, the application of supporting agents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in case of polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediated fusion, was confirmed to be more efficient in creating higher number of fused cells than using PEG alone [34, 35]. PEG, due to its hydrophobic properties, decreases the distance between cells by removing water (thermodynamically unfavourable environment) and causing their aggregation. Dehydration leads to asymmetry in the lipid membrane bilayers leading to formation of a single bilayer septum at a point of close apposition of two cell membranes and facilitates formation of the pore following septum decay (Fig. 72.2).\n\n",

Currently, CF is utilized either indirectly during production of monoclonal antibodies or directly by creating cellular therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat a variety of diseases and conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammation, and transplant rejection. Creation of immortalized hybridomas is an essential part of monoclonal antibody production. Antibodies such as Muromonab-CD3 (anti-CD3) are directly produced by mouse hybridomas [49]. However, basiliximab (anti-CD25), which is a chimeric antibody, is primarily created by mouse hybridoma and further modified by utilizing recombinant DNA technology to replace the mouse immunogenetic component of the antibody with human protein [50].",

Anti-cancer vaccines created by ex vivo CF between dendritic cells (DC), which are potent antigen presenting cells, and carcinoma cells are among the most promising strategies dedicated to introduce cancer specific antigens to DC. The aim of this approach is to enhance immune system response against cancer cells. Fusion between DC and tumor cells eliminates the limitation of low number of known tumor-associated antigens available for HLA molecules. Hybrid cells containing unidentified molecules and expressing them in combination with MHC Class I and II molecules in the presence of co-stimulatory signals may be an effective alternative for patients suffering from rare forms of cancer. The results of cancer immunotherapy using anti-cancer vaccines in vitro, as well as in mouse model, showed potent anti-tumor response against multiple tumor-associated antigens [51, 52]. Currently, this immunotherapy is being evaluated in the treatment of melanoma and breast cancer patients in phase II clinical trials.",

The most challenging issue in clinical execution of the primary chimera creation protocol is the critical time frame following bone marrow infusion required for development of chimeric pro-tolerogenic environment in the transplant recipient. Pre-treatment of the transplant recipient in order to create in vivo DRCC will be possible only for the living organ donor. To overcome this hindrance and move forward to a more clinically applicable model, Siemionow\u2019s group adopted a new approach to create DRCC via ex vivo CF. DRCC therapy was created by fusion of donor and recipient bone marrow derived cells by polyethylene glycol (PEG) technique. Briefly, bone marrow cells were harvested from the tibia and femur bones of two fully MHC mismatched ACI (RT1a) and Lewis (RT1l) rats using the flushing technique. Next, erythrocytes were removed and white blood cells from each donor were separately stained with PKH26 (red/orange) or PKH67 (green) cell membrane fluorescent dye. Fluorescent staining of cell was applied in order to detect and separate double stained (green and red/orange) DRCC created during fusion using fluorescence activated cell sorting (Fig. 72.3). PEG mediated ex vivo fusion protocol is feasible to be performed in the surgical unit and will provide higher number of DRCC compared to in vivo protocol. This technique does not require cells of similar diameter or specific proportions as in electrofusion [60].\n",

The assessment of DRCC confirmed the presence of MHC class I derived from both donors on the surface of chimeric cells as well as the presence of ACI and Lewis-specific genomic sequences. The phenotype evaluation showed that more than 40 % of chimeric cells were CD90 positive. Additionally, mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay showed immunologic unresponsiveness of chimeric cells and colony forming unit assay revealed that chimeric cells are able to create the same types and comparable numbers of colonies as untreated bone marrow cells. DRCC were tested in vivo as a supportive therapy for allogenic vascularized skin allograft under Siemionow\u2019s laboratory seven day immunosuppressive protocol of anti-\u03b1\u03b2TCR monoclonal antibody (250 \u03bcg/kg/day) and cyclosporine A (16 mg/kg/day). The results of this study showed increased survival of the allograft confirming pro-tolerogenic properties of DRCC. Prolonged survival of the fully MHC mismatched allograft was associated with the presence of the donor-derived cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs of the recipient rats. One of the potential DRCC mechanisms of action might be similar to the one observed by Chow et al. where cell expressing recipient MHC were able to avoid detection of recipient immune response [61]. Another possible mechanism can be migration of DRCC to the lymphoid organs such as thymus where these cells affect selection of donor-reactive T cells causing induction of chimerism and acceptance of the allograft.",
