The trends of influenza vaccination rates increased from 32.9% in 2010 to 52.2% in 2018 but the trends of pneumococcal vaccination rates were relatively stable at less than 20%.

Invasive pneumococcal diseases (such as meningitis and bacteremia) and pneumonia from Streptococcus pneumoniae are associated with increased mortality among individuals with diabetes [12] . Therefore, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends pneumococcal vaccination in individuals with diabetes [13] . There are currently two types of pneumococcal vaccines -Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13) and Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV23). Guidelines for pneumococcal immunization across the world are complex and vary greatly between countries in terms of age groups and risk groups recommended for vaccination, as well as which vaccine should be administered. In Thailand, our current national guidance on adult immunization still reflects the previous version of ACIP recommendation which suggested routine PCV13 for adults ages 65 years and older and followed with PPV23 one year later [14] . For people with diabetes younger than 65 years, only PPV23 is suggested to be administered and repeated every 5 years.",

It was conducted in patients with T2DM from 2010-2018 at Theptarin Hospital, a private multi-disciplinary diabetes center in Bangkok, Thailand. This study was a part of our annual quality improvement program which has been carried out since 2010 in order to improve various aspects of diabetes care and benchmark results in each diabetologists. Over 2,000 registered T2DM patients follow-up regularly at our diabetes center. Patients with age < 15 years, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and patients with other types of diabetes were excluded. The data on patient characteristics, smoking status, glycemic control, pattern of diabetes treatments, adherence to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations according to current guidance on adult immunization in Thailand were collected [14] . We used medical records as a source to assess the receipt of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. The vaccination venue could be either inside our hospital or other healthcare services. Because influenza vaccination is provided for free in people with diabetes in the government healthcare programs since 2008, some patients might receive free influenza vaccination elsewhere. The presence of comorbidities was determined by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [19] which composed of 19 medical conditions. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6) and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for each patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities was found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in higher mortality.",

There was a peak period of seasonal flu activity in Thailand during 2015-2016. This phenomenon is explained by the possibility of vaccine hesitancy effect regarding its effectiveness against the pandemic [28] . Another possible explanation is our hospital policy to start collecting influenza vaccination as a key quality improvement program since 2015. Therefore, it could affect the surge of vaccination rate in the first year after implementation. However, these observations underscore the need for sustainable interventions to increase vaccination uptake. Even among European Union countries, none could achieve the target for influenza vaccination of 75% in people living with chronic disease (the median uptake rate was only 50%) [9] .

The rate of pneumococcal vaccination uptakes in patients with T2DM are variable and difficult to benchmark when compared with influenza vaccine coverage rate. In contrast to some higher income countries such as South Korea which the coverage rate of PPV dramatically increased after the national policy to give free vaccine in all elderly Koreans aged \u226565 years [17] , pneumococcal vaccine has to be paid out-of-pocket in Thailand. Although pediatricians generally recommend PCV in infants, it has not been included in the National Immunization Program and the vaccine coverage is still low in children [30] . PCV13 vaccine has been approved for adults in Thailand in immunocompromized conditions and people with diabetes age \u2265 65 years old since 2011 but lack data to establish costeffectiveness in general people. As a result, less than 5-10% of Thai people with T2DM received pneumococcal vaccination from a previous study in Thailand [31] . As shown in this study, the coverage rate of our patients with severe comorbidities was almost 10 times greater than patients with mild comorbidities. This data implies that the importance of pneumococcal It is important to note that our study has several limitations. First, this study was conducted only in a private hospital in Bangkok. The findings could not be generalized to other patients with T2DM in Thailand. The socioeconomic factor influences the decision to receive both vaccines in many patients. In private settings, the patients have to pay the cost of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine for themselves. Therefore, this study may have underestimated the rate of influenza vaccination if patients did not inform the treating physicians that they were already received influenza vaccination from other places. For the pneumococcal vaccination, our vaccine coverage rate may be overestimated from the patients with higher socio-economic status in private settings. Similarly, the health beliefs and knowledge of influenza among various diabetologists in our hospital could affect the overall rate of vaccination in our study. But our study could serve as a reference for future studies on vaccinations among Thai people with diabetes. Second, data on vaccination in some patients were documented by treating physicians as self-report data from their patients. The recall bias from these patients could affect the results. However, an earlier study reported that self-reporting may be the only effective and feasible way to gather data from diverse population [33] .",
