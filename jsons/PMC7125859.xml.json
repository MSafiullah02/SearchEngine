Infection is more common in those exposed to animal products contaminated with spores, such as meat, drum skins, or wool. After an incubation period of approximately 7 days, the lesion characteristically begins as a papule and progresses to a black eschar. Diagnosis is often clinical, although culture, biopsy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serology confirm the diagnosis. Mortality is low if the disease is recognized and treated with appropriate antimicrobials. Treatment regimens include oral ciprofloxacin or doxycycline (although penicillin may be used if susceptibility is known) for 7 days. If exposure was through a biological attack, treatment duration is extended to 60 days to cover incubating spores that may have been inhaled. Injectional anthrax has been exclusively linked to use of contaminated illicit drugs whereas gastrointestinal anthrax is due to ingestion of contaminated food.3, 4\n",

The disease is characterized not by pneumonia but by mediastinal widening (Fig. 2\n) that can progress rapidly to shock. Toxin-laden pleural effusions may be present. The disease begins after a week-long incubation period and is typically biphasic with flulike symptoms (with the notable exception of rhinorrhea) occurring before a terminal phase.

The third drug could be ciprofloxacin. If meningitis has been ruled out, ciprofloxacin and clindamycin or linezolid could be used for treatment (with de-escalation of ciprofloxacin to penicillin once drug susceptibility is known). Treatment is for 2 weeks to 3 weeks.5 Adjunctive antibody therapies, available from the CDC, such as anthrax immune globulin, raxibacumab, and obiltoxaximab, also should be given.5 Additionally, if present, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites should be drained, a factor that has likely improved survival rates from inhalational anthrax in the modern era.6\n",
