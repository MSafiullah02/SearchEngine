However, important clinical and laboratory details of these viruses, such as duration of shedding, transmission rates, viral load over time, immunity, and morbidity in high-risk populations, are not well characterized. Such information becomes more important and clinically relevant as we consider world-wide pandemics such as the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak.",

A coronavirus was first isolated as a causative agent of bronchitis in birds in 1937 [1] and was originally discovered in humans during studies that evaluated the common cold. The history of the discovery of HCoVs is shown in Table 1 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The common human coronaviruses known today include the species 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1. These 4 viruses are primarily viewed as relatively benign respiratory pathogens in humans, typically causing upper respiratory tract disease and common cold symptoms. By contrast SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are highly pathogenic in humans, with high rates of severe pneumonia and fatal outcomes [21] . Currently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide, causing anxiety, disease, and mortality [22, 23] . Despite the heightened interest, limited pediatric data are available regarding either the community HCoVs or the newer pathogenic species in children. Here, we review what is known about HCoV infections in children in the precoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era.",

Coronaviruses were named for their characteristic crown-like surface projections seen in electron micrographs that correspond to large surface spike proteins. These viruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA viruses and have the largest identified viral RNA genomes, with an approximate length of 30 kilobases [24] .",

In the 1970s, studies that used serology and viral culture linked HCoVs 229E and OC43 with 8% of cases of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in hospitalized infants [30, 31] . Poor replication in tissue culture and a lack of cytopathic effect in early attempts at culture were major obstacles in making further progress in the field. The development and widespread use of molecular diagnostics as well as the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003 significantly accelerated coronavirus research. Subsequently, new HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 were identified and are frequently seen in children. Additional pathogenic coronavirus species and outbreaks with MERS-CoV and, recently, SARS-CoV-2 have led to increased interest, research, and concern [21, 23] . Community-acquired HCoVs species OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E are found worldwide in temperate and tropical countries, as well as low-, middle-, and high-income countries [32, 33] . HCoV infection can occur at any time of the year, with unpredictable year-to-year patterns, and outbreaks are reported in some years and in certain parts of the world. All 4 species may circulate yearly and even simultaneously [34] , with the highest rates of HCoV infection seen in winter and spring months in temperate climates [21] . Almost all surveillance data indicate HCoV-OC43 is the most common species. A large prospective surveillance study conducted in Norway from 2006 to 2015 that enrolled all hospitalized children aged \u226416 years with respiratory tract infections revealed that HCoVs OC43 and NL63 were detected most frequently and were epidemic every second winter [35] . HCoV-HKU1 was prevalent every second winter during the year when detection rates for HCoVs OC43 and NL63 were low; HCoV-229E was the least common.",

Coinfections are relatively common, especially in children aged \u22645 years. A prospective surveillance study in Norway demonstrated that annual hospitalization rates of children with LRTI associated with HCoV detection were 1.5 and 2.8 per 1000 children aged <5 years and aged <1 years, respectively [35] . The mode(s) of HCoV transmission is not known [21, 25] . It is assumed that transmission occurs via a combination of droplet and direct/indirect contact, similar to other respiratory viruses. HCoVs OC43 and 229E appear to be primarily transmitted during the first few days of illness when symptoms and viral load in the respiratory tract are highest. The incubation period of HCoV-229E was 2 to 5 days (median, 3 days) in adults in challenge studies and has not yet been clearly defined for other HCoVs or in children [25, 44] . The transmission of HCoV in community epidemics is impacted by the characteristics of HCoV infection and shedding in children. Children have higher attack rates, as high as 78% within households, compared with adults, as shown in an active surveillance study in Kenya [45] . These data complement community studies in the 1960s that showed a higher frequency of HCoV-229E in families with children aged <15 years [36] , a higher rate of HCoV-OC43 infection in children aged <5 years [46] , and frequent clustering of infections within families [46] . The attack rate of HCoV in childcare settings has also been shown to be higher with younger age [47] .",

Children aged <5 years with HCoV detection were frequently asymptomatic, especially with HCoV-229E. These findings reinforce serologic-based findings of asymptomatic infection in 7% of children with HCoV-229E in the 1960s [50] . Clinical symptoms associated with the 4 common HCoVs generally appear to be indistinguishable from cold symptoms or influenza-like illness (rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, wheezing, and fever) associated with other respiratory viruses [21, 25, 51] and generally are similar in children and adults.",

It is assumed that HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 have similar pathogenicity, although this has not been proven in challenge studies. The frequent detection of HCoVs in asymptomatic patients as well as coinfection with other respiratory viruses make the interpretation of HCoV pathogenesis and clinical findings challenging. A multicenter, prospective surveillance study conducted in the United States evaluated the prevalence of HCoVs among hospitalized children with acute respiratory illness and demonstrated that the prevalence of HCoVs was similar in both asymptomatic and symptomatic groups of children [52] . In contrast, a prospective community surveillance study of respiratory viruses in Utah showed HCoV detection was often associated with symptoms in all age groups, suggesting HCoV infection might have been previously underestimated as an etiology of respiratory tract infection [49] .",

A Norwegian prospective surveillance study compared children hospitalized with respiratory tract [47, 48] . Children attending group childcare were tested prospectively for respiratory viruses at each acute respiratory illness (ARI). Swabs were collected weekly from ARI onset until symptoms were nonworsening and swabs were negative by real-time-polymerase chain reaction [47] . Human coronavirus (HCov)-positive swabs (for all species) are represented by filled circles, and negative swabs are represented by open circles. weeks on x-axis were calculated as weeks since symptom onset with an HCov (+) acute respiratory illness. the lower limit of positivity was set at 1000 copies/mL for this analysis.

One retrospective study of 212 hospitalized children with HCoV (54 with and 158 without viral coinfection) showed that similar numbers of children received respiratory support and intensive care [57] . Bivariate analyses showed that younger age (<2 years) and chronic complex medical conditions (cardiovascular, respiratory, genetic, or congenital) were associated with increased disease severity. No specific species were associated with severity of illness. Although the presence of viral coinfection was not associated with increased disease severity, the analysis did not assess the impact of specific types of coinfections. A retrospective analysis of 1237 children who presented to Seattle Children's Hospital (Washington) for acute care with detected HCoVs showed that disease severity did not vary by HCoV species [58] . Younger age, presence of underlying pulmonary disorder, and presence of coinfection, particularly RSV, were associated with increased likelihood of LRTI in multivariable models.

Data are limited for this high-risk population and particularly are lacking in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients [68] . Among 404 children aged <18 years who underwent allogeneic HCT from April 2008 to September 2018 at Seattle Children's Hospital, HCoVs were the third most common respiratory viruses detected post-HCT following rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus (preliminary data). The cumulative incidence of HCoVs in children during the first 365 days following HCT are shown in Figure 2 . HCoVs were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from 2 young children in this cohort. The detection of HCoV in BAL specimens among HCT recipients and patients with hematologic malignancy was also evaluated, but only 1 of 35 patients was a child [69] . Among 16 patients in that study (15 adults, 1 child) with HCoV and without other coinfections identified by BAL, 10 required oxygen support, suggesting a role of HCoV as a significant respiratory pathogen. In a retrospective study of immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised children with HCoV detected in nasal specimens in Seattle, the prevalence of LRTI that required oxygen supplementation (severe LRTI) was 15% (13/85) and 11% (122/1152), respectively [58] . Multivariable models showed that immunocompromised state, presence of RSV, and underlying pulmonary disorder were associated with increased risk of severe LRTI. A prospective surveillance study with weekly nasal sampling in 215 allogeneic HCT recipients of all ages demonstrated that the median shedding duration of HCoVs was 3 weeks (range, 0-22 weeks) [70] . Our follow-up study suggests that high viral load, high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning are associated with prolonged shedding (\u226521 days) of HCoV in allogeneic HCT recipients (2 pediatric and 42 adult patients) [71] . Using available nasal samples from patients with prolonged shedding, we performed whole-genome sequencing, which revealed only small and slow genomic changes, consistent with previously estimated evolution rates. This is in contrast to more rapid genomic changes associated with influenza infections [72] . In addition, an 18-year-old pediatric patient had 3 HCoV species (OC43, HKU1, 229E) detected sequentially over a 5-month period without an associated poor outcome.",

Risku et al investigated the presence of HCoVs in stool of children with and without gastroenteritis. All 4 species were found in 2.5% of stool samples (22/878) from children with gastroenteritis, whereas 1.7 % of stool samples (2/112) from controls were positive for HCoVs. However, other known enteric pathogens, such as rotavirus or norovirus, were also found in 18 of 22 stool samples in children with gastroenteritis. Among 4 patients with only HCoV detected in stool, 3 had respiratory symptoms [73] . Another study examined both stool and nasopharyngeal swabs in hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis and in controls [74] . HCoVs were more frequently detected in patients with gastroenteritis than in controls (23/260, 8.8% vs 4/151, 2.6%, respectively). Interestingly, in patients with gastroenteritis, more than half (13/23) had respiratory symptoms and HCoVs were more frequently found in nasopharyngeal samples than in stool samples (22/256, 8 .6%, vs 6/260, 2.3%, respectively). Based on these studies, the significance of HCoVs as enteric pathogens appears minor.",

Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV in children are nonspecific, and it can be very difficult to differentiate SARS-CoV from other respiratory tract infections without laboratory testing in the outbreak setting. However, certain features may provide a clue. A comparison of 15 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV and 15 age-and sexmatched patients with culture-confirmed influenza in Taiwan revealed that rates of fever, cough, and constitutional symptoms such as chills and myalgia were similar between the 2 groups, but patients with SARS-CoV had significantly less rhinorrhea, sputum production, and sore throat than those with influenza [88] .

The role of children in the spread of disease with these novel viruses remains unclear. As the current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 unfolds, more information regarding the role of children in viral transmission and their clinical presentation and outcome will become more evident.
