A clear example of this step-change is represented by the amount of DNA sequence data that can be now produced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms. Similarly, recent improvements in protein and peptide separation effi ciencies and highly accurate mass spectrometry have promoted the identifi cation and quantifi cation of proteins in a given sample. These advancements in biotechnology have increasingly been applied to the study of animal infectious diseases and are beginning to revolutionize the way that biological and evolutionary processes can be studied at the molecular level. Studies have demonstrated the value of NGS technologies for molecular characterization, ranging from metagenomic characterization of unknown pathogens or microbial communities to molecular epidemiology and evolution of viral quasispecies. Moreover, high-throughput technologies now allow detailed studies of hostpathogen interactions at the level of their genomes (genomics), transcriptomes (transcriptomics), or proteomes (proteomics). Ultimately, the interaction between pathogen and host biological networks can be questioned by analytically integrating these levels (integrative OMICS and systems biology). The application of high-throughput biotechnology platforms in these fi elds and their typical low-cost per information content has revolutionized the resolution with which these processes can now be studied.",

More recently, smaller benchtop sequencers [ 7 ] have become available, making the technology more accessible for use in routine microbiology laboratories, while academic core facilities and commercial service providers focused increasingly upon providing users with access to a wider diversity of the sequencing technologies available.

This includes the error rates of the Fig. 1 Steps in next-generation sequencing and data analysis workfl ows where error and bias introduction may occur sequencing chemistry and library construction, as well as point mutations and insertions/deletions that may arise during reverse transcription and PCR amplifi cation. The amplifi cation of DNA by PCR to obtain clonal template sequences is subject to error introduction [ 8 ] and may result in an amplifi cation bias impacting the relative frequency of sequence variants present in the sample. Sampling bias can be introduced when a relatively small number of samples are analyzed per epidemiological unit (e.g., single animal or herd) due to fi nancial constraints restricting the thorough use of NGS. When only a small proportion of the nucleic acids in a single sample are subjected to sequence analysis, technical sampling bias occurs. While NGS data provides a high resolution of an individual sample, the resolution of higher epidemiological scales (Fig. 2 ) may thus be compromised due to insuffi cient sampling. Moreover, as a minimum amount of genetic material is needed as input for NGS workfl ows, this can result in bias towards samples with the highest pathogen titers. Errors and bias may also be introduced by methods to increase the sensitivity of the workfl ow, such as targeted pathogen genome amplifi cation [ 10 -12 ] or enrichment (e.g., [ 13 ]).",

Each of the different NGS platforms available has its own distinct characteristics in terms of read and error profi les, with the Illumina platform often regarded as having the lowest error rate, while other platforms can produce longer reads [ 7 , 18 , 19 ].

Currently, a multitude of software has been developed to address different aspects of NGS analyses [ 27 , 28 ] . However, the available algorithms for both genome assembly and amplicon analysis can present some limitations [ 29 ] , meaning that custom-made scripting and in-house resolution of bioinformatic problems are often needed to investigate novel datasets and specifi c hypotheses. In this context, researchers are frequently faced with the need to acquire computer skills and bioinformatics expertise. To evaluate the potential of NGS for a wider group of scientists and diagnosticians, there is a real need to develop fl exible and practical bioinformatics workfl ows that can provide user-friendly tools for the analysis of massive datasets and that become publicly available. Although some software with a menu-driven approach is available (e.g., Geneious, CLC Workbench, Galaxy), most applications are optimized on UNIX-based operating systems and require some bioinformatics expertise.

Although limited datasets (e.g., resulting from the desktop-range 2nd-generation sequencers) can be managed using modest computing resources, like high-end desktop computers running virtual Linux machines [ 4 ], larger datasets typically require high-performance computational clusters, which present a considerable investment and require suffi cient information technology (IT) support. Cloud computational resources (i.e., renting time from commercial high-performance computational clusters) may be a solution [ 30 ] although further developments are needed, given the data transfer issues resulting from huge fi le sizes [ 4 ]. Another issue for diagnostic laboratories is protection of data from unauthorized access, which cannot be guaranteed in the cloud, as data from diagnostic examinations need to be kept confi dential. For labs frequently producing NGS data, data storage and backup costs can be substantial. Ideally, these huge genetic datasets should be made publicly available to the scientifi c community as they provide a source of information applicable to better understanding disease, design of targeted assays, systems biology, and integrated OMICS analysis approaches. To this end, online repositories such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA; [ 31 ]) have been created to store both raw NGS and intermediate analysis fi les.",

Targeting specifi c polymorphic genes in the Cryptosporidium parvum genome using NGS, extensive intra-host genetic diversity was documented [ 40 ] . Studies of the transcriptome (all mRNA transcripts in an organism, tissue, or cell; also called RNA-Seq ) of different parasite species and/or developmental stages provide insights into aspects of gene expression, regulation, and function, which are major steps to understanding their biology (reviewed in [ 41 ] Over the last fi ve years, NGS has been used as an extremely important tool in the tracing of transmission, genome characterization, and outbreak management of both viral and bacterial diseases. The sequencing of these two pathogen types poses very different sets of challenges and issues, where the large data output expressed typically in the Mb (megabase) to Gb (gigabase) range [ 4 ] is particularly suited for the sequencing of larger bacterial genomes. The high plasticity of some microbial genomes, with large mobile elements, genecoding plasmids, chromosomal genes, and regions of extensive genetic variability, can frequently complicate genome assembly [ 46 ] . While most viral genomes are signifi cantly smaller than their bacterial counterparts, the viral replication biology (particularly that of RNA viruses) poses its own unique problems. These involve the inherent variability of many viral genomes due to replication machinery lacking effi cient proofreading mechanisms. This, combined with a short generation time and high replication rate, results in a complex mix of differing genomes (a \"swarm\" of closely related viruses) within a single host that are often termed as \" quasispecies ,\" reviewed in [ 47 ] . In addition, recombination and reassortment of segmented viral genomes frequently occur. NGS techniques offer an unprecedented \"step-change\" increase in the amount of sequence data that can be generated from both types of these samples. Figure 3 (different scales of sequence analysis) highlights where genetic analyses can target different biological scales and whether these are within an individual host, or between hosts, resulting in either host variation or inter-herd diversity/outbreak transmission.",

Although the common goal is to identify potential pathogens, the studies can roughly be divided into three categories: (1) investigations of outbreaks of unknown etiology, (2) investigations of well-known disorders presumed to be of multifactorial etiology, and (3) Although it is an important fi rst step, the identifi cation and genetic characterization of candidate pathogens are not enough to establish causal relationships or understand how they may be associated with disease. It is therefore necessary to use a synergistic approach combining molecular diagnostic tools, such as NGSbased metagenomics and follow-up PCR-based assays targeting detected pathogen sequences, with more conventional diagnostic methods, including isolation and characterization. This is crucially important in situations where metagenomic data indicate the potential presence of multiple pathogens. While PCR-based prevalence studies in matching disease cases and healthy controls can provide further evidence for disease association, isolation of candidate pathogens is required to assign causality by addressing Koch's postulates [ 120 ] . The assembled data from such a multidisciplinary (pathology, epidemiology, metagenomic data, PCR prevalence studies, isolation, characterization, etc.) should be used to identify the most likely candidate etiologic agent and to make informed intervention decisions. The synergetic and parallel use of molecular and classical methods not only results in detection of infectious agents and development of targeted diagnostic tests but also has the potential to make isolates or strains available shortly after the occurrence of outbreaks. The availability of isolates or strains is of special importance to allow the design of effective vaccines or antimicrobial drugs.",

            "text": "The technological possibility to study both the host and the pathogen with high resolution on the level of their genome, transcriptome, or proteome opens opportunities to study host/ pathogen interactions at several levels ((genomics, transcriptomics, microRNA s (miRNA)) and ultimately to analytically integrate these levels (integrative omics or systems biology) aiming to study the interaction of pathogen, microbiome, and host biological networks with many examples in veterinary science. Nordentoft and colleagues [ 134 ] used NGS metagenomics to study the infl uence of livestock management parameters and infection with Salmonella enteritidis on the microbial community in the chicken intestinal tract. Another study [ 135 ] documented the effect of Campylobacter jejuni infection on the chicken fecal microbiome. The application of metagenomic techniques in poultry production could lead to the development of novel alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters and better understanding of the colonization of food production animals by foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter spp. [ 36 ] . Other studies investigated the host response to pathogen infection. Glass and colleagues [ 136 ] used NGS transcriptomics to document bovine resistance and tolerance traits to parasitic infection. The technology was also used to study the ferret transcriptome response to infl uenza infection [ 137 ] , the chicken transcriptome response to Marek's disease [ 138 ] , the swine response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection [ 139 ] , and the changes in the mouse transcriptome after Brucella sp. infection [ 140 ] . microRNA s are considered to be a key mechanism of gene regulation in both parasites and viruses. Their characterization contributes to better understanding the complex biology of pathogens. Wang and coworkers [ 141 ] characterized microRNA sequences from Orientobilharzia turkestanicum , a fl uke with zoonotic potential infecting sheep, and identifi ed key target miRNAs for parasite energy metabolism, transcription initiation factors, signal transduction, and growth factor receptors. Virus-encoded microRNAs (vmiRNA) regulating viral or cellular transcripts can be targeted for virus discovery [ 142 , 143 ] . miRNAs also play important roles in regulating host-pathogen interactions. NGS has been applied to investigate whether infection can modulate miRNA biogenesis and has also been used to identify miRNAs that infl uence pathogen replication, tropism, and pathogenic potential [ 144 -149 ] . In particular, cellular miRNAs have been shown to interact with the viral genomic RNA or mRNA, facilitating or inhibiting the virus life cycle. These molecules have demonstrated immense potential as a source of antiviral therapeutics effective against a number of viruses (adenovirus, rabies, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, porcine reproductive and syndrome virus [ 150 -153 ] ) or for the design of live-attenuated virus vaccine based on miRNAmediated gene silencing [ 154 , 155 , 147 ] .",

[ 65 ] studied local transmission patterns of Mycobacterium bovis in cattle and wildlife reservoirs using whole genome sequences from 31 samples originating on fi ve farms. These demonstrated enough diversity between individual outbreaks to determine evolutionary variation down to herd level. The identifi cation of novel antimicrobial resistance genes in the foodborne pathogen Campylobacter coli [ 66 ] was possible using NGS, and the application of NGS technologies during a recent crisis involving foodborne enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O104:H4 allowed a swift genomic identifi cation [ 67 ] that was key to the management of this crisis. Finally, the technology also proved very informative to study the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary history of extremely monomorphic Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC [ 68 ] in addition to studies tracing medically signifi cant pathogens [ 69 -71 ]. Samples from the US 2006-2007 West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak in birds were characterized using Illumina sequencing, resulting in the identifi cation of a new genetic variant containing a 13-nucleotide indel [ 72 ]. A survey of Chinese domestic fowl using RNA-Seq on an Ion Torrent identifi ed a novel Coronavirus, providing insights into the diversity and distribution of avian coronaviruses [ 73 ]. A further study has also investigated the role of Usutu virus in causing epizootic infection in blackbirds in Germany [ 74 ]. The advent of NGS has also led to the cost-effi cient sequencing of complete viral genomes including avian infl uenza virus [ 75 -78 ], classical swine fever virus [ 79 ], and bluetongue viruses [ 80 ]. An optimized method incorporating 454 sequencing for universal nonspecifi c RNA viral genomes from brain and cell culture material was applied to Lyssaviruses [ 81 ]. Other groups have reported the characterization of Louping ill virus in lambs [ 82 ], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [ 83 ], and herpesviruses from Asian elephants [ 84 ]. Furthermore, studies using random amplifi cation techniques have identifi ed mixed infections of paramyxoviruses and avian infl uenza in bird populations [ 77 , 85 , 78 ]. Effi cient infl uenza A-specifi c resequencing strategies [ 86 , 87 ] have allowed the study of quasispecies-scale genetic variability with implications for immune response [ 88 , 89 ], host cell line adaptation [ 90 , 91 ], antiviral drug resistance [ 92 ], and pathogenicity [ 53 ]. Likewise, effi cient targeted CSFV genome sequencing using NGS has led to insights in classical swine fever virus (CSFV) epidemiology based on isolates from an outbreak in wild boar from Germany [ 79 ] and in the role of quasispecies diversity in CSFV pathogenicity[ 93 ].",
