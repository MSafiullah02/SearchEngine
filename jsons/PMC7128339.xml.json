By contrast, several studies done after the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea yielded important epidemiological, clinical, virological, and management outcome data.8 MERS-CoV sequence variants were detected during the South Korean outbreak, with some mutations incorporated into the circulating virus. Remarkably, the most extensively studied mutations, which occurred in the surface glycoprotein were not predicted.8 The surface glycoprotein is crucial for virus entry and during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic it evolved to bind more tightly to its cellular receptor. By contrast, changes detected in MERS-CoV-surface glycoprotein appeared to decrease binding and were expected to decrease virulence and transmissibility;8 however, these changes could be beneficial to the MERS-CoV by facilitating evasion of the antibody response.",

And how do patients without contact with camels acquire the disease? Sequence analysis of MERS-CoV isolated from patients in the Middle East revealed mutations in the virus, most of which were transient with reversion to wild type sequence,9 which is inconsistent with continuing adaptation to humans. Many of the virus variants were observed circulating in camels at the same time,13 suggesting continuing camel-to-human transmission, which might have obscured adaptive changes in the human virus. Small differences in sequences were observed when east African and Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV isolates were compared, with more substantial differences observed when compared with west African MERS-CoV, including deletions detected in west African MERS-CoV.12 These differences might contribute to diminished transmission; however, another possibility is that differences might occur in human\u2013camel contact in Africa versus the Middle East. Camel workers and owners have close contact with camels and thus have increased prevalence of MERS-CoV immunopositivity (3\u201367%) than the general population (0\u00b715%).14, 15 Camel workers have mild or subclinical disease, and they might transmit MERS-CoV either directly or indirectly to more susceptible individuals (eg, those with comorbidities) who would present as sporadic cases.",

First, continuous sequence analysis of MERS-CoV in endemic countries is needed to establish viral evolution, as was the case in the South Korean outbreak. Second, increased understanding of camel\u2013human interactions and patterns of camel grazing in Africa and the Middle East could provide insight into transmission differences. Third, an effective vaccine for humans is the best way to prevent spread of MERS but logistical issues because of the small number of sporadic MERS cases in different geographical locations need to be overcome. Alternatively, vaccination of juvenile camels might block transmission. Fourth, development of antiviral and other therapies for MERS-CoV would improve patient outcomes and, by decreasing virus burden, could decrease transmission. Finally, continued efforts to educate camel workers about infection control measures, such as handwashing and wearing protective gear when handling camels, especially juvenile ones with upper respiratory tract infections, will be crucial in minimising transmission.",
