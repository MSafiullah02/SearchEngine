Both methods revealed limited amounts of polymorphism. Since the SSCP analysis concerned an expressed DRB gene it can be concluded that the level of functional MHC class I1 polymorphism, at least at the DRB locus, is low in Swedish moose. DNA fingerprinting was used to determine if the unusual pattern of low MHC variability could be explained by a low degree of genome-wide genetic diversity. Hybridizations with two minisatellite probes gave similarity indices somewhat higher than the average for other natural population, but the data suggest that the low MHC variability cannot be explained by a recent population bottleneck. However, since minisatellite sequences evolve more rapidly than MHC sequences, the low levels of MHC diversity may be attributed to a bottleneck of more ancient origin. The selection pressure for MHC variability in moose may also be reduced and we discuss the possibility that its solitary life style may reduce lateral transmission of pathogens in the population.

There are two distinct classes of MHC molecules, class I and class II, which are encoded by separate but tightly linked loci. Both are cellsurface glycoproteins which function as presenters of intracellulary processed peptides. In a majority of the species so far studied, MHC represents the most polymorphic gene system found in the genome. Unlike most other polymorphic genes, MHC variability is characterized by the presence of a large number of alleles that occur at intermediate frequencies (Klein 1986 ).

Preserving MHC polymorphism has in fact been put forward as being a prime objective in all conservation programs (Hughes 1991) . In line with this, it has been proposed that the extremely low level of MHC variability in the African Cheetah (O'Brien et al. 1985; Yuhki & O'Brien 1990 ) may be related to a marked susceptibility to a feline coronavirus infection in a group of captive individuals (O'Brien et al. 1985) . Severe outbreaks of infectious disease in some other species speculated to possess reduced MHC variability may represent similar situations as well (OBrien & Evermann 1988) . We are involved in a study of the possible association between genetic variation at MHC loci and susceptibility to a lethal disease syndrome, still of unknown origin, among Swedish moose A. alces (Stken et nl. 1993) . We have now used various molecular techniques to assess the amount and characteristics of MHC class I and class I1 variability in Swedish moose and in parallel analysed their genome-wide variability by means of DNA fingerprinting. We show here that these animals exhibit low levels of MHC polymorphism concurrent with a fairly high degree of genomic diversity.",

The finding of low levels of MHC variability in Swedish moose is thus supported by the inherent sensitivity of the SSCP technique. The fact that an expressed moose MHC gene was analysed rules out the possibility that the limited variability could be explained by a reduced selection pressure at a locus of no functional significance. The sequence analysed by SSCP, exon two of DRB, encodes the antigen recognition site in the first extracellular domain of dass II / 3 chain genes. In other species, the genetic polymorphism of class n gene products is concentrated to particular amino acids involved in antigen binding encoded by this exon (Brown et al. 1988) . A characteristic feature of this polymorphism, as known from various species, is that there is a considerable amino acid divergence between alleles (Klein 1986; Andersson & Davies 1994) . In an accompanying study we have shown that the Swedish as well as the Canadian moose does not only possess limited amounts of DRB poly&orphism but also has minor sequence variations between alleles (Mikko & Andersson 1995) .",

A possible explanation would be that a previous bottleneck could have reduced the genetic variability. Similar to the situation for the Scandinavian beaver population (EIIegren et nl. 19!33), the size of the Swedish moose population was reduced due to over-hunting in the last century. The pop ulation has subsequently recovered and has increased dramatically during the 20th century, currently harbouring some 400 OOO individuals. However, the extent of the bottleneck in the 19th century is uncertain (cf. Ryman et al. 1980) and our data strongly argue against a severe reduction since DNA fingerprinting patterns were far from monomorphic. The observed band-sharing probabilities (0.4.49) are somewhat higher than that previously found among outbred natural populations (e.g. Reeve et al. 1990 ), but do not indicate a dramatic loss of genetic variability. Similarly, Ryman et al. (1980) analysed allozyme variability in a large number of moose sampled at various localities in Scandinavia and found a mean heterozygosity, within each popdation, of 0.020. Again Cheetah, Menotti-Raymond & O'Brien (1993) calculated that the moderate DNA fingerprinting variability found among modem Cheetahs could have been reconstituted (from complete homozygosity) in the order of 10 OOO years.",

            "text": "Besides the possible effects caused by an ancient bottleneck, the low levels of moose MHC variability could also be due to a relatively weak selection pressure for p l ymorphism at these loci. There is a clear difference between the moose and cattle as regards their degrees of MHC polymorphism in relation to their genome-wide genetic variability measured by DNA fingerprinting. The DNA fingerprinting variability of moose is similar to that among several domestic animals, including cattle (Georges et nl. 1988), and is significantly lower than that in humans. In contrast, the degree of MHC polymorphism in moose is much lower than that in both cattle and humans. Differences in the intensity of pathogen-driven, balancing selection affecting moose and cattle may contribute to the marked differences in their degree of MHC diversity. Domestic cattle are kept in dense herds which obviously facilitates the transmission of pathogens between animals. The moose, on the other hand, has a rather solitary life style. Males' close contacts with other animals are probably restricted to the reproduction period, a situation that would reduce the lateral transmission of pathogens in the population. The Swedish moose consequently provides an additional example of a viable population with restricted MHC polymorphism. Slade (1992) noticed that three marine mammals from two different orders (the elephant seal, the sei whale and the fin whale) exhibit low degrees of MHC variability despite no apparent loss of allozyme heterozygosity. He proposed that this could be due to a reduced balancing selection pressure in the marine environment, a possible consequence of decreased exposure to pathogens. Trowsdale et nl. (1989) , who analysed the two whale species, argued that the aquatic environment would impose less contact between the animals compared to a terrestrial environment and that this would hamper the spread of pathogens in the population. A similar but controversial idea has been invoked to explain the apparent lack of MHC class I polymorphism in Syrian hamsters (Darden & Streilein 1984) ; the solitary life style of this species could act as a barrier for pathogen transmission as well (McGuire et nl. 1985) . In this context it could be noted that beavers, of which at least three European populations appear to be devoid of MHC polymorphism (Ellegren et nl. 1993), also have a rather isolated life style. Although they live in family groups and dispersal may occur in natal drainage systems, large land areas separating different river systems can be seen as barriers for long-range dispersal and hence also for lateral transfer of pathogens.",

The frequencies of allele A and ti = respectively. Genotype frequencies were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( x 2 = 0.29, NS). The observed heterozygosity was 50%.The low levels of genetic variability found in RFLP analysis of Swedish moose using different class I and class II probes indicate that the overall degree of MHC polymorphism in this species is limited. A comparison with bovine data gives strong support for this conclusion.Sigurdard6ttir et al. (1988) used the same probes/enzymes as in this study in an extensive survey of MHC class I1 polymorphism in cattle. They found 21 DQ and 25 DR haplotypes, while we only found two DQ haplotyEs in moose. Moreover, among 197 domestic bulls, 185 were DQ heterozygotes (94%; Sigurdarddttir et al. (1988)).
