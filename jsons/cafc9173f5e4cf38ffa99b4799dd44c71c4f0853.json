We constructed five mutant full-length cDNA clones with the overlapping regions unwound and 1 to 3 restriction sites inserted between two adjacent ORFs (ORF1/2, ORF4/5, ORF5/6, ORF 6/7 and ORF7/3\u2032 UTR), which generated the recombinant viruses. Our findings demonstrated that 1) the overlapping structural protein ORFs can be physically separated, and is dispensable for virus viability; 2) such ORF separations did not interrupt the subgenomic RNA synthesis; 3) the plaque morphology, growth kinetics, and antigenicity of these mutant viruses were virtually indistinguishable from those of the parental virus in cultured cells; and 4) these mutant viruses remained genetic stable in vitro. This study lays a foundation for further molecular dissection of PRRSV replication process, and development of genetically tagged vaccines against PRRS.",

            "text": "PRRSV is further classified into two distinct genotypes, (European) Type I (Wensvoort et al., 1991) and (North American type) II (Benfield et al., 1992) . As a member of the Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) , PRRSV is similar to lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) in terms of genomic structure, the mechanisms employed for replication and transcription. PRRSV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 15 kb in length (Meulenberg et al., 1993) , with a 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. The genomic coding region was flanked by terminal untranslated regions (UTR), 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-UTR, which play key regulatory roles in the viral life cycle (Shanmukhappa et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2007; Verheije et al., 2001 Verheije et al., , 2002a . The genome includes at least 9 open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORF3-7. ORF2-7 encode at least 7 structural proteins including glycoprotein 2 (GP2), GP3, GP4, GP5, Membrane (M) protein, Nucleocapsid (N) protein, and the recently recognized ORF2b-encoded 73 amino acid nonglycosylated (E) protein (Mardassi et al., 1996; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Meulenberg, 2000; Mounir et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999; Saito et al., 1996; Thiel et al., 1993; Wootton et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2005) . The functions of the structural proteins play in the virus replication process warrant further study. For instance, there is no experimental evidence supporting the assumption that GP5 is the viral attachment protein, while it is under debate if GP3 is a structural constituent of the PRRSV virion (Mardassi et al., 1996; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Meulenberg, 2000) .",

Several lines of evidence support two models: a leader-primed transcription model, with another involving the discontinuous extension of minus-strand RNA. Based on these models, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS, UUAACC for PRRSV) of the Leader (5\u2032 UTR in PRRSV) and the downstream Body TRS (TRS-B), preceding the ORF coding region of the structural protein in the viral genome play key roles in discontinuous transcription (Pasternak et al., 2006) . Base-pairing between the Leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complementary sequences in the minusstrand of the TRS-B mediates discontinuous jumping during synthesis of the minus-strand templates for EAV sgmRNAs (van Marle et al., 1999) . TRS-flanking sequence could also affect nidoviral transcription (Curtis et al., 2004; Nelsen et al., 1999; Pasternak et al., 2004 Pasternak et al., , 2006 Sola et al., 2005; Yount et al., 2006) . In addition, Pasternak et al. (2004) engineered several copies of a body TRSflanking sequence cassette inserted into an EAV full-length clonederived replicon, and observed that sgmRNA abundance progressively favor smaller RNA species, implying that downstream TRS-B could exert negative effect on the upstream one. The specific mechanism(s) underlying subgenomic RNA transcription of PRRSV have not been elucidated clearly. For instance, numerous TRS-like sequences exist in PRRSV genome, and noncanonical TRSs were detected for all individual PRRSV sgmRNAs (Nelson et al., 1993; Meng et al., 1995; Zheng et al., unpublished data) . In addition, the role of TRS-flanking sequence plays for PRRSV sgmRNA synthesis remains to be known.",

These infectious clones have also provided powerful tools for the development of genetically engineered vaccines that can be differentiable with PRRSV field isolates, a desirable trait of vaccine for ultimate eradication of PRRS. Furthermore, such reverse genetic system (RGS) provides an excellent platform for functional dissection of arteriviral structural proteins. However, it is known that variable length of overlapping coding sequence shared by the adjacent ORFs of the structural proteins. For example, an overlapping region of 255 nt exists between ORF3/4 of Type I PRRSV, while 15 and 10 nt span the coding regions between ORF5/6 and ORF6/7, respectively Meulenberg and Petersen-den Besten, 1996; Morozov et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999) . The biological significance of these overlapping regions on PRRSV replication is unknown. On the other hand, such overlapping nature poses problem for genetic manipulations of an individual structural protein ORF without affecting the adjacent one. Aiming to define the cell tropism determinant, Verheije et al. (2002b) constructed chimeric arteriviruses using Type I PRRSV infectious clone as backbone expressing the terminal domains of EAV GP5 and M protein, and found that these assumed viral attachment protein GP5 or M failed to change cell tropism as expected. In addition, these authors found that separation of the overlapping regions was critical for viral viability for such chimeric viruses, implying that arterivirus gene expression is tightly regulated. de Vries et al. (2000) demonstrated that while the precise arrangement of the overlapping regions for EAV structural proteins was also necessary for viral infection, it was possible to rescue virus from transfected cells when overlapping regions between ORF4/5, ORF5/6, and ORF4/5/6 in EAV infectious clones were separated by inserting polylinkers. Although numerous PRRSV infectious clones have been successfully constructed (Calvert et al., 2002 (Calvert et al., , 2003 Fang et al., 2006a; Meulenberg et al., 1998; Nielsen et al., 2003; Truong et al., 2004; Yuan and Wei, 2008) , the issue of overlapping coding regions of the structural proteins still impedes functional studies.",

We also directly inserted Pac I, Swa I, and Asc I sites between ORF1/2, and inserted a unique restriction enzyme site (Nde I) between ORF4/5, and ORF7/3\u2032 UTR. A series of mutation viruses were recovered after transfection of cells using in vitro RNA transcripts of the constructed full-length mutant DNA clones. Our findings demonstrated that 1) the overlapping nature of the coding regions for structural proteins is dispensable for the PRRSV viability; 2) the insertion of foreign nucleotide sequence is feasible for physical separation of the ORFs coding for structural proteins, and such separation did not interrupt the subgenomic RNA synthesis; 3) the plaque morphology, growth kinetics, and antigenicity of these mutant viruses were virtually indistinguishable from those of the parental virus in cultured cells; and 4) these mutant viruses remained genetic stable for at least five passages in vitro culture system.

Moreover, nucleotide sequence comparisons between the corresponding regions of the mutant plasmid, P 1 , and P 5 viruses showed that there were no other mutations in the flanking region (1-2 kb) of the inserted restriction sites.

Virus plaque morphology remained essentially the same with that of the parental virus, vAPRRS. Multiple-step growth curves of the mutant viruses were measured by determining the virus titres (PFU/ ml) of the supernatant collected at the indicated time points. As shown in Fig. 3B , the titer of the parental virus vAPRRS (\u25a1) was consistently slightly higher than those of the five mutant viruses, and peaked at 72 hpi. In contrast, the mutant viruses lagged 12 h in reaching maximum titer. In particular, the peak titer of vORF56c (\u25bd) was 7.58 \u00d7 10 4 PFU ml \u2212 1 at 84 h, considerably lower than the1.51 \u00d7 10 6 PFU ml \u2212 1 at 72 hpi of wild-type virus, indicating that the insertion between ORF 5 and 6 could adversely affects the virus growing ability.

Indeed, the flanking sequences of TRS influence sgmRNA transcription (Curtis et al., 2004; Nelsen et al., 1999; Pasternak et al., 2004 Pasternak et al., , 2006 Sola et al., 2005; Yount et al., 2006) . de Vries et al.

The recombinant PRRSVs described in this study did not produce detectable novel subgenomic RNA, but insertion between ORF5/6 might cause the down-or up-regulation of the upstream sgmRNA2/3 and 4, respectively. Curiously, the same insertion sequence inserted between ORF6/7 barely affected virus replication. It implies that the 39 nt insertion of into ORF5/6 locus induces changes of local secondary structure and spatial relationship with some yetunknown upstream transcription-regulating elements.

Because of a series of sgmRNAs are employed, nidovirus is attractive vector in that multiple GOIs can be express theoretically. Unlike coronaviruses containing numerous accessory genes for virus replication, arterivirus has a rigid icosahedral nucleocapsid and overlapping coding regions, it proves to be difficult to find an optimal locus for GOI expression. Numerous studies have been directed utilizing the nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) coding region, the most variable part of PRRSV genome, as a GOI insertion site (Fang et al., 2006b; Han et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2007) . In most cases, the inserted genes were modified and/or chewed out during further serial passage, maybe due to the fact that nsp2 and its fusion form have to be under proteolytic processing during nsp maturation. In our study, we developed a platform that can be potentially used to express GOI between ORFs coding for structural proteins. In addition, these mutant cDNA clones would be of great value for making chimeric PRRSV as vaccine candidate. Using an attenuated PRRSV derived infectious cDNA as the backbone, one can readily swap in the immuno-protective protein(s) easily. Such chimeric virus vaccine would be genetically tagged, and powerful to combat the ever-changing PRRSV (Wang et al., 2008) .",

Briefly, oligonucleotide primers were designed such that the foreign insertion sequence were incorporated at the 5\u2032 end or in the middle of the primer, leaving at least 10 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end matching with the template sequence. Using circular plasmid DNA as the template, PCR were run as descried in the instruction manual of the QuickChange mutagenesis kit. The plasmid template was eliminated by Dpn I digestion (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA), followed by transformation of Top 10 competent cells (Invitrogen) with the digested PCR mixture. The intermediate plasmid was screened and verified by restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequencing, and the target region were swapped into the pAPRRS backbone treated with the same restriction enzymes, resulting in the final full-length mutant clone. The purified full-length mutant plasmid was all verified by PCR, restriction enzyme digestion and nucleotide sequencing. ",
