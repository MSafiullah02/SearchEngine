A survey was undertaken of faecal contamination in relation to recreational activities in the Peel Harvey estuarine system, Western Australia. Levels of exposure to contaminated water were estimated though social surveys. Follow-up was also conducted to estimate the incidence of disease associated with bathing in the estuary. Pathogen levels exceeded the guideline values recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at most locations throughout the year. The social survey provided information about exposure of the population in age groups. Only 31% of the recreational users belonged to the healthy adult group upon which the WHO quantitative microbial risk assessment model is based. A correlation was established between microbial water quality and incidence of respiratory diseases for children as well as for adults. Exposure to recreational water increased the incidence of respiratory illnesses for the whole population almost by a factor 2. Behaviours which resulted in increased exposures were associated with increased incidence of illnesses were observed, particularly among children aged 11-15 yr, who exhibited the highest odd ratio .01], CI 95%, p \u00bc 0:05). There is a need for combining epidemiology studies with risk assessment processes and complementing them with social surveys for understanding the risk of recreational activities to public health.",

Some QMRA models have been applied to waterborne pathogens accounting for both immunity and person to person transmission (Eisenberg et al., 1996; Eisenberg et al., 1998 ; Soller et al., 2003) . Risk in recreational waters was addressed using such a model in Soller et al. (2003) . However, children should be taken into separate consideration in QMRA (Nwachuku and Gerba, 2004) as they may display attack rates higher than adults when swallowing water and submerging their head (Balbus et al., 2004) . Age has also been investigated as the primary determining factor related to the type and severity of health outcomes from enterovirus exposures in recreational waters ; however, limited data on this subject are currently available in the peer review literature.",

To eliminate these biases, the survey lasted 4 h in the afternoon-from 1 PM to 5 PM-on each occasion. The sampling location ''Mandurah Bridge Beach'' is located in the City of Mandurah, at the mouth of the estuary. The water recreational area was small (about 500 m 2 ) suggesting that sampling would be close in space to the recreational users. Preliminary data showed that while indicator levels in the recreational area were higher in the afternoon than in the morning when the number of recreational users was lower, they did not significantly vary during the afternoon (data not shown). To reduce the shortterm variability of the indicator (Boehm et al., 2002) duplicate samples were collected at 3 PM, on each day the survey was conducted as well as outside the bathing season. Two water samples were collected 30 cm below the surface inside the main swimming area, one of the duplicate a few metres from the ''upstream side'' of the enclosure (where the river water enters the swimming area), the second few metres from the ''downstream side'' of the enclosure (where the river water leaves the enclosure).",

(1998) reported that exposure to FS could be predictive of acute febrile respiratory illnesses (AFRI). Preliminary investigations showed that FS rather than E. coli should be used as indicator of faecal contamination in the estuary as E. coli was only detected in the recreational area studied, but at very low levels (o10 cfu/ ml). Duplicates samples were collected for the determination of faecal streptococci in waters and analysed according to the Australian Standard Method (AS 4276.9-1995). Weather conditions were monitored at the time of sample collection.",

A follow-up interview was conducted by telephone 2 weeks later. Information on who swam and who became ill within the family or group was gathered on that occasion. Gastrointestinal illness (GI) was recorded whenever an individual reported two or more occurrences of loose stools per 24 h or two or more incidences of vomiting, or diarrhoea with abdominal pain, vomiting or nausea or one episode of vomiting with abdominal pain or nausea or any of two of the symptoms together (Payment et al., 1997) . The symptoms of GI did not include fever to include infections such as giardiasis. The case definition of respiratory illness (RI) was similar to that of McBride et al. (1998) who did not require fever to include common cold-as low-grade fever may not be noticed-but who neglected hay fever and asthma. We therefore focused on viral rhinosinusitus (common cold syndrome or non-specific upper respiratory tract infection), which is an acute illness typically characterised by rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough and low grade fever (Rosen-stein et al., 1998) . Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are the main culprit as they together account for up to 60% of these infections (Anderson et al., 1993) . Ear infection was recorded only when confirmed by medical examination. Potential confounding factors such as food and drink intake, age, sex, history of disease, pregnancy, additional bathing, jellyfish sting, travel and period of exposure to sun were checked during the second interview.",

The reasons included an unwillingness to give away phone details, a phone contact failure within the time frame as well as criteria which made them unacceptable for the purpose of the study (previous illness, time spent in the area under 2 h, etc.). We could, however, observe a relationship between excess of respiratory illnesses and exposure to pathogens expressed as levels of faecal streptococci (Fig. 3) . Fig. 4 provides density distribution of odd-ratios according to age groups. The distribution pattern, linked to recreational behaviour, illustrates the need for taking recreationists behaviour into account in risk assessment models. A jetty from which children jump into the water, finishing with a slide, used mainly by older children surrounded the recreational area investigated in this study. This type of activity, where water can be pushed into the nasal cavity, may have prompted the excess of illness in the age groups 11-25 yr. The highest OR was observed for the age range 11-15 yr (OR 4.23 [2.44-6.01] CI95%, p \u00bc 0:05). Several studies reported frequent symptom rates in lower age groups (Cabelli et al., 1998; Fattal et al., 1997; Pr\u00fc ss, 1998) . We noticed high RI and GI incidence rates in very young children (less than 5 yr old). Their activity, mainly playing with wet sand above the shoreline promoted sand and water ingestion, and may have resulted in an excess of GI and RI. The GI cases observed in the age group 26-35 yr corresponded mainly to secondary infection by contact between parents and children. The absence of illness in adults over 46 yr old may have resulted from the small sample size, but also from the swimming behaviour of older people, who were observed keeping their head above the water while swimming.",

According to the WHO (2001) guidelines, recreational users swimming at Mandurah during the swimming season have an unacceptable risk of contracting a GI or RI illness (1.3% to more than 10% according to the time of the year) each time they swim (Fig. 1) . However, QMRA provides estimates based on assumptions and extrapolations from existing data. The dose-response curves used in QMRA have been generated using healthy adult volunteers without existing diseases. In this study only 31% of the recreational water users (primary contact) belonged to that category. Of the population 50% was under 15 years of age, and was therefore more susceptible to water-related illnesses (Wade et al., 2003) . A large majority of these children (490%) were wading, swimming or playing with wet sand above the shoreline. The expected relative exposure to pathogens for wading or playing with wet sand above the shoreline was expected to be different (lower) from the exposure upon which the WHO guidelines were based. However, use of the beach by diapered-children that may increase the potential for water-borne disease transmission (Carpenter et al., 1999) and presence of gulls may have resulted in higher relative exposure for playing in the wet sand. Levels of FS indicator in sand showed that beach sand may be a reservoir for pathogens (data not shown).",

The recreational area at Mandurah town is used by large groups of extended families (up to 61 individuals in one single group). Significant loss of follow-up can result if one group cannot be contacted. The large groups and families may also have contributed to bias in the study by creating clusters of illnesses. However, the short time frame (2 weeks) between the two interviews, and the simultaneity of symptom appearance in most cases led us to conclude that clusters were not important in our study. Furthermore Pr\u00fc ss (1998) calculated that for significant results, the study population size should reach a minimum of 1700 swimmers and 1700 non-swimmers under the hypothesis of a 5% background illness rate and an excess rate of 50%. Such sample size could not be achieved in the present study, as 100 people or less were present at any time during the interview periods. The sample size may explain the absence of relationship between GI and FS in particular.",

However, the requirement for two or more symptoms of illness, and medical confirmation for ear infections decreased bias from this issue. Another issue was the impact of variables such as swimming duration, water activity, age, gender, health condition and local immunity on vulnerability to contaminated water (Machado and Mourato, 2002) . The vast variation in resistance or immunity among the population makes it impossible to calculate accurately the effects of swimming in polluted waters. Miscalculation of exposure may produce an artificially low threshold for increased risk (Pr\u00fc ss, 1998), and a difference in threshold could be due to a study population limited to adults (higher immune status resulting in higher threshold), or to a lower pathogen/indicator ratio. Here the threshold was quite high (251 FS per 100 ml for the whole population, 235 FS per 100 ml for children (o16 yr), and 260 per 100 ml for adults (16-55 yr), (see Fig. 3 )), most likely due to a lower ratio between pathogen and indicator resulting from a repetitive stirring of the sediments (Youn-Joo et al., 2002) . However the attack illness rate was higher than that predicted by WHO for FS concentrations above 238 FS per 100 ml. The study of Kay et al. (1994) on which WHO predictions are based was conducted in northern European waters (2001) . The dose-response relationship they established may not be applicable in Western Australia, where a threshold more representative of warmer waters may be more appropriate. Higher threshold for increased risk has also been, in some countries, linked to immunity due to endemicity (Pr\u00fc ss, 1998), or local immunity. Since most of the study participants (70%) were local residents, local immunity might have reduced the excess illness among bathers at low FS levels.",

Furthermore, the low illness rates observed in people sick at the time of the first interview could merely indicate that people generally avoid the beach when sick and the OR of 1.6 between sick children and adults would therefore not be a reliable value for comparing background of illness. The choice of a reliable value representing background of illness is difficult as few relevant data are reported in the literature. This choice becomes even more difficult when children are involved. Background of illnesses and confounders have been mainly reported in relation to childcare attendance. Slack-Smith et al. (2004) reported rates of 0.49 per annum of AFRI in child care settings, corresponding to OR of 1.46. Fleming et al. (1987) observed 24% of upper respiratory infection (URI) and 6% of ear infection in children under 5 yr old during a period of 15 days, corresponding to ORs of 1.6 (p \u00bc 0:02) and 3.8 (p \u00bc 0:05), respectively, when assuming a background level of 15%. In Western Australia, more than half of children under 5 yr do not attend childcare (ABS, 1999) . This, and the fact that the study was mainly conducted over summer holidays led us to assume that childcare attendance would not be an important confounder in that study, even if it may impact immune levels, therefore attack rates at relatively low FS concentrations.",

Z-test using two-tailed test (a \u00bc 0:05) showed that exposure to recreational water increased significantly the incidence of respiratory illnesses for the whole population by almost a factor two (p \u00bc 0:0002, potwo-tailed). When considering age group subpopulations, the increase was statistically significant only for the age group 11-15 yr. The lack of significance for other age groups could merely be due to the small sample size. The choice of an appropriate rate of background illnesses was also important as, in the present study, applying the same rate to all children sub-populations would have resulted in a statistically significant increase of respiratory illnesses in the age group 0-5 yr old.",

This study suggested a relationship between incidence of disease and age group based on the recreational behaviour the different age groups exhibit. This relationship would be consistent with a true dose-response relation rather than the concentration-response relation upon which recreational criteria are based. In a QMRA paradigm, these concentration-response functions assume a constant exposure volume. The results of this study seem to indicate that such an assumption may not be valid for all ages. Because of the small size of the sample, significant relationship between RI incidence and age group-consequently dose-response relation-could only be established for the age group 11-15 yr.
