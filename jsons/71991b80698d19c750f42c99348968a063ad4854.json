Respirology 2004; 9 : 271-273 Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emergent disease due to a novel coronavirus, which caused outbreaks worldwide. Methodology: We report a SARS patient who had developed recurrent chest pain and acute T-wave inversion over the precordial leads on electrocardiography (ECG). Results: She developed progressive subcutaneous emphysema a few days later. Her CXR showed features suggestive of pneumomediastinum, which was confirmed by high-resolution CT scan of the thorax. Conclusion: Pneumomediastinum should be considered in SARS patients as a possible cause of chest pain and ECG changes that mimic acute coronary syndrome.",

Her past health was unremarkable. On admission, she had right middle zone ground-glass haziness on CXR and a lymphocyte count of 0.3 \u00a5 10 9 /L. She fulfilled the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS. 2 Oral levofloxacin, intravenous ribavirin and methylprednisolone were started in accordance with the standard treatment protocol at our institution (Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong). 3 On day 5 (9 days after onset of symptoms), her CXR showed progressive infiltration in both lung fields and she began to require supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min. Intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (2 g over 2 days) was then given with gradual improvement in oxygen saturation (97% on supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min). On day 12, she developed recurrent compressing chest discomfort on minimal exertion and oxygen saturation was 86% on supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min. An ECG showed new T-wave inversion over the precordial leads. Creatinine kinase and cardiac troponin T levels were normal. She was treated for acute coronary syndrome with antiplatelet and antianginal medications including clopidogrel, subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin, trimetazidine, high-dose atorvastatin, metoprolol, nitrate and amlodipine. In the afternoon, she developed respiratory failure and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for non-invasive ventilatory support. Her condition stabilized over the next 4 days and she was successfully weaned off ventilatory support. However, despite maximized medical treatment, she still complained of recurrent chest pain with reversible ECG changes of T-wave inversion in the precordial leads over the subsequent 6 days. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with no regional wall motion abnormalities or pericardial effusion. A coronary angiogram was subsequently performed with due infection control precautions, and showed normal coronary arteries. On day 18 (6 days after onset of chest pain), subcutaneous emphy-sema was found over the right side of her neck. A CXR revealed a band of transradiancy in the upper mediastinum outlining the upper ascending aorta (Fig. 1) . On review, this finding was not present in any of the daily CXR taken prior to day 18. High-resolution CT scan (HRCT) of her thorax confirmed the presence of a pneumomediastinum (Fig. 2) . Her chest pain gradually subsided with analgesics and the ECG showed normalization of T-waves in the precordial leads during the subsequent convalescent period. She was discharged on day 41 after admission.",

Severe hypoxaemia secondary to respiratory distress in the absence of coronary artery disease has also been reported to be a cause of reversible T-wave inversion. 9 However, our patient had persistent symptoms with reversible ECG changes even after stabilization of respiratory failure and weaning from ventilatory support, making this unlikely.",

When this is absent and initial CXR are not conclusive, serial CXR and HRCT of the thorax may be used to confirm the diagnosis.",
