            "text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) is an important pathogen in domestic dogs and several wild carnivore species. It belongs to the genus Protoparvovirus within the family Parvoviridae [1]. The virus replicates autonomously in host cells, and is genetically related to feline parvovirus (FPV) and mink enteritis virus (MEV), which infect different host animals [2]. The original CPV-2 was first identified in 1978 and has rapidly spread worldwide [[3], [4], [5]]. Soon two antigenic variants, CPV-2a, which emerged in 1979 and contained 5 amino acid substitutions in VP2 [6], and CPV-2b, which appeared in 1984 and had a single additional substitution in VP2 [7], replaced the original type [8]. The third variant CPV-2c with Glu426 mutant emerged in Italy initially [9] and now the three variants have been circulating in dog populations around the world [5,10,11]. CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c are distinguished by one or two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the sequence of the VP2 gene. SNPs at positions 1276 and 1278 of the VP2 gene determine whether residue 426 of the VP2 protein is Asn (CPV-2a), Asp (CPV-2b) or Glu (CPV-2c) [8].",

Infection with any type of the CPVs, dogs show similar signs, which include loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. The CPV types cannot be distinguished by examination or the signs of disease observed from the infected dogs. So we need a method to detect and differentiate the CPV types, which is benefit for treatment of infected dogs with the homogenous polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies of CPV.",

CPV was readily distinguished from the FPV and MEV isolates using AGP test with 6 MAbs generated against CPV [34]. CPV-2b could be distinguished from the CPV-2 and CPV-2a by the reactivity of two MAbs, MAb I and MAb B [7]; and CPV-2b could be distinguished from CPV-2a with MAb 21C3 [32]. However, all these MAbs are not able to recognize CPV-2c. With three MAbs, B4A2, 21C3 and 19D7, one CPV-2c isolate (HNI-4-1) was distinguished from CPV-2b by HI assay [33]. The HI test using MAbs need fresh erythrocyte and could not be used for non-haemagglutinating strains [35].",

Gupta et al. developed an isothermal amplification technique, polymerase spiral reaction (PSR), for detection of CPV genomic DNA. PSR was a simple, rapid, and cost effective method for diagnosis of canine parvoviral enteritis in veterinary clinics, but it cannot differentiate CPV-2 from its variants [18]. Mini-sequencing based single nucleotide polymorphism analysis was developed for CPV typing [38], but it was time-consuming and expensive. Compared to conventional PCR, real-time PCR is more sensitive and time saving for detection of viral DNA. A SYBR Green based real-time PCR assay was developed for detection and quantitation of CPV in fecal samples of dogs [13]. A TaqMan real-time PCR assay was developed to discriminate between type 2-based vaccines and field strains of CPV [19], and another assay was used to identify the variants [39].",

The assay is specific and sensitive, as no amplification was detected by other viruses, CDV, CAV, and CCV, and the detection limit is as low as 101 genome copies. When combined samples of CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c of different titers were tested by the multiplex real-time PCR assay, four targets can be detected simultaneously and consistently without interference each other.",

Because there is a T302C mutation of VP2 gene in type 2 isolate HB3 (GenBank No. GU392238), and a T303C mutation of VP2 gene in the circulating variants, for example, isolate BJ15-6 (type 2a, GenBank No. KT162043), isolate BJ15-12 (type 2b, GenBank No. KT162027) and isolate 06/09 (type 2c, GenBank No. GU380303), in China. In the study, we designed the primers and probes of CPV-2 and the variants assay based on the SNP G913T between CPV-2 and the variants, and the nucleotide at position 913 was conserved in circulating strains in China. Therefore, we conclude that the multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR assay we reported here is suitable for detection and differentiation of all CPV variants in China.",

The original CPV type 2 was replaced by the genetic and antigenic variants worldwide, including China [8,10,11,40]. We currently do not know why the CPV-2 has reemerged in dogs in China. Apparently, more work needs to be done to answer this question.",
