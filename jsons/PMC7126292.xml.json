Increased mortality, emergency room visits, and hospital admissions worldwide have been associated with vulnerable populations exposed to heat waves (Anderson and Bell, 2011, Knowlton et al., 2009, Semenza et al., 1999). However, several studies reported that the adverse health effects of cold temperatures may be more significant than those of high temperatures in Spain, Canada, Shanghai, and Taiwan (Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010, Lin et al., 2011, Ma et al., 2011, Martin et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2012). Mortality risk associated with low temperatures is likely underestimated when studies fail to address the prolonged effect of low temperature (Martin et al., 2012, Mercer, 2003).",

However, other weather variables, such as relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and water vapor pressure may also affect human perceptions of ambient temperature. The cold effect is most severe when accompanied by strong winds (Kunst et al., 1993). Therefore, composite indices, including the temperature humidity index (THI), wind chill index (WCI) (Kunst et al., 1994, Woodall, 2004), apparent temperature (AT) (Anderson and Bell, 2009, Chung et al., 2009), effective temperature (ET) (Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010, Gonzalez et al., 1974) and net effective temperature (NET) (Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010, Li and Chan, 2000), have been applied to evaluate health risks associated with cold spells or low temperatures. However, few studies have focused on the cold effect in subtropical areas and its relationship to cold-temperature indices (Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010).",

(2011) reported that no significant association exists between maximum apparent temperature and hospital admissions for respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases in Denmark (Wichmann et al., 2011). Multicity studies reported the cold effects were most significant in warm regions (1997; Langford and Bentham, 1995, Wang et al., 2012) or areas with moderate winter climates (Conlon et al., 2011). Residents in warm regions have less physical, social, and behavioral adaptations to low temperatures. Residing in a subtropical area with high temperatures and high humidity, the population in Taiwan is more susceptible to low temperatures than to high temperatures (Chen et al., 1995, Lin et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012, Wu et al., 2011, Yang et al., 2009). Therefore, this study aimed to identify cold-temperature indices appropriate to evaluate the association between temperature and health events in Taiwan. This study reported the cumulative relative risks for mortality and outpatient visits of all causes and cardiopulmonary diseases associated with eight standardized cold-temperature indices\u2014average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and THI, WCI, AT, ET, and NET.",

The WCI, based on ambient temperature and WS, was used to evaluate the combined effect of temperature and wind, especially during the cold seasons (Roshan et al., 2010). Wind draws heat away from the exposed body, making exposed people feel cold (Siple and Passel, 1945). To assess temperature exposure for humans, Taiwan Central Weather Bureau adopts the THI (Rosenberg et al., 1983), which resembles the thermal discomfort index developed by the US Weather Bureau, and widely used in Europe (Pantavou et al., 2011). The AT, which defines human thermal comfort, can be combined with temperature, atmospheric pressure and WS into one indicator (Steadman, 1984). The ET encompasses air temperature and RH that has been applied as a biometeorological index of man's thermal discomfort (Gonzalez et al., 1974, Hentschel, 1987). The NET uses temperature, RH, and WS as a cooling indicator (Li and Chan, 2000).",

Standardization of cold-temperature indices eliminated scale differences of indices, facilitating comparisons among models for the estimated risks. Average temperature is the optimal cold-temperature index in predicting all-cause and cause-specific mortalities. The optimal index for predicting cause-specific outpatient visits varied with disease type. The daily average temperature and composite ET are the best indices for associating all-cause outpatient visits. Minimum temperature is the best index for predicting the number of outpatient visits for respiratory diseases. All-cause mortality was found to have a negative association with temperature that increased by 17\u201324% when average temperature was at Z = \u2212 1 and by 27\u201341% when average temperature was at Z = \u2212 2 for the three study areas. The relative risk of all-cause outpatient visits increases slightly by 2\u20137% at Z = \u2212 1; however, the risk is not significant at Z = \u2212 2. Low temperatures have greater adverse effects on mortality from circulatory diseases and outpatient visits for respiratory diseases than on other health effects.",

The incidence and severity of respiratory infections increases when it is cold, leading to increased hospital admission (Mourtzoukou and Falagas, 2007).

However, no methodology has been standardized for the best prediction of the temperature-related health loss. The general population may easily appreciate a single temperature measurement, such as an average temperature, which can be easily measured by the public (1997; Lin et al., 2011, Martin et al., 2012). Europe's PHEWE project adopted maximum 3-hourly apparent temperature (Tappmax) in association with the risks of mortality and hospital admission because Tappmax combines temperature and humidity that consider the effects of evaporation and perspiration in warm environment (Michelozzi et al., 2007). Two studies found that WCI has been concluded as a better marker than other temperature measurements for estimating cold-related health outcomes in two studies (Carder et al., 2005, Kunst et al., 1994). Gomez-Acebo et al. (2010)) found minimum temperature the most sensible measure among all single temperature measurements. However, they concluded that the risk patterns were very similar, regardless of which indicator was used (Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010). A study in Seoul found minor differences in the mortality risks among assessments using average temperatures, minimum temperatures, and the changes of temperatures between days (Ha et al., 2009). After adjusting for humidity, Anderson et al. failed to observe significant differences in temperature\u2013mortality associations measured with metrics of average temperature, maximum temperature, and AT. Barnett et al. (2010) further suggested choosing a temperature indicator based on practical concerns for being able to use the integrated data. Our study suggests that average temperature and ET are two optimal cold-temperature indices for modeling the all-cause mortality relationship with cold temperature. For mortality from cardiopulmonary diseases, average temperature is consistently the optimal cold-temperature index for modeling. However, the optimal cold-temperature index varies with cause-specific outpatient visits. The THI and average temperature are better than the other cold-temperature indices in associating low temperatures with all-cause outpatient visits. For the relationship between cold temperature and respiratory outpatient visits, minimum temperature is the best index (Anderson and Bell, 2009, Barnett et al., 2010).",

Some studies suggested RH and WS are worthy of further investigation in temperature-health association studies (Analitis et al., 2008, Michelozzi et al., 2007). However, two studies reported no significant association between RH and mortality at low temperatures (Healy, 2003, Schwartz et al., 2004). On the other hand, WS may enhance the cold effect with the accompaniment of strong winds (Kunst et al., 1993). Because some composite cold-temperature indices have considered the effects of RH and WS, we could not observe whether health events are related to RH and WS in this study.",

Risks for mortality from all causes and circulatory diseases increase as temperature decreases. Low temperatures have the greatest adverse association with outpatient visits for respiratory diseases. However, we found no significant association between cold temperatures and mortality from respiratory diseases and outpatient visits for circulatory diseases. Standardization of cold-temperature indices facilitates the evaluation of the relationship between various cold-temperature indices and health risks. This study suggests that average temperature and ET are the two best cold-temperature indices for modeling the low temperature\u2013mortality relationship for population residing in the subtropical environment. The optimal cold-temperature index for predicting cause-specific outpatient visits varies among diseases. The THI and average temperature are optimal indices for modeling the relationship between low temperatures and all-cause outpatient visits. Minimum temperature is the best index for predicting outpatient visits for respiratory diseases.",
