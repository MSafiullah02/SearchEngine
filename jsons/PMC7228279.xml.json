At the beginning of the study period, participants were visited in their homes where researchers obtained written consent and a record of current and previous health using a standard questionnaire. Parents were trained to recognize respiratory symptoms, and were instructed to keep a daily symptom diary for 8 weeks. A modified Jackson (1958) severity score was used to construct the symptom diary. Symptoms tracked included sneezing, sore throat, runny nose, cough, fevers, aches or pains, unwell/off\u2010color, and wheezing. Each symptom was graded on a 0 to 3 severity scale, with 0 being no symptoms, 1 being mild symptoms, 2 moderate symptoms, and 3 severe symptoms. Researchers also trained parents in the collection of nasal swabs (FLOQ pediatric swabs, COPAN UTM transport media, COPAN Diagnostics Inc., Murrieta, CA) which were to be taken when visible mucus was first produced during episodes of respiratory symptoms, and then stored upright in the participant's freezer until collection at the end of the study. At the conclusion of the study period all participants were again visited in their homes, where symptom diaries and nasal swabs were collected, and a final nasal swab was taken by researchers. Swabs were transported frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C at the University of Otago, Wellington. Frozen swabs were transported to Virology Research Laboratory, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney at the end of each viral season.",

Children 1 year of age were positive for a respiratory virus in 88.9% of samples taken during an ARI, compared to 69.8% in participants aged greater than or equal to 5 years age. A similarly designed household surveillance study showed that weekly detections of viruses in young (aged <5) and older (aged 5\u201017) children were significantly more frequent than in adults.20 In the current study swabs were taken at the onset of illness, when viral load reportedly peaks for some respiratory viruses.21 It is possible that this method is more likely to detect viruses associated with ARI than other studies obtaining weekly swabs. Sample sizes of each virus detected here were too small to compare individual viruses between age groups. However, a multi\u2010country community surveillance study has previously shown that with the exception of influenza, prevalence of individual respiratory viruses was highest in younger children.3 The rates of ARI per child\u2010month were similar between age groups, suggesting that other factors such as development of allergy may play a more significant role than age in acute respiratory health.",

Consistent with previous reports in the Southern Hemisphere RSV peaked in this pediatric population in early winter.4, 22 Interestingly, we found a similar pattern for detection of HCoV. It has recently been reported in China that while overall HCoV infection is most prevalent in winter, HCoV subtypes display different epidemic patterns.23 As only a small number of HCoVs were detected (n = 50), we did not distinguish between subtypes when reporting our results. Influenza was detected from June to October and peaked in July. A limitation was that no data were collected for the summer and autumn periods, capturing only the times of highest respiratory virus activity. This may account for the low detection of AdV, HBoV, and EV in comparison to other year\u2010round epidemiological studies.24 A year\u2010round analyses may also allow for investigation of phenomena such as the February back to school HRV peaks.25\n",

Previous groups have reported that RSV and HMPV rarely occur in asymptomatic subjects,11, 26, 27 suggesting that detection of these viruses is almost always of clinical relevance. IFV may be present in people with few or no symptoms. However, the duration and copy number of viral shedding is considerably lower in these cases,28 and further research is needed to understand the contribution of asymptomatic detection to community transmission. In the present study, we found these viruses in very few samples of asymptomatic subjects, and demonstrated these three viruses (and others) to be significantly associated with ARIs.",

Our data, along with another recent study19 suggest that HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C subtypes are significantly more likely to cause symptoms related to ARI. In our study HRV\u2010B, AdV, and HBoV were detected similarly in samples from both ARI episodes and asymptomatic periods. While their corresponding risk ratios are not considered significant, the number of detections of these viruses is relatively small, and a larger analysis would be required to rule out the clinical significance of detecting HRV\u2010B, AdV and HBoV in ARIs.",
