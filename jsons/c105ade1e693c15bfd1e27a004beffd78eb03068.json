The PQ symmetry is a remnant of the B \u2212 L gauge symmetry at the renormalizable level. Besides, the sufficient quality of the PQ symmetry is preserved by a non anomalous discrete gauged R-symmetry and a small gravitino mass m 3/2 100 GeV. A viable mass range is m 3/2 = O(1) eV which allows a high reheating temperature and many baryogenesis scenarios typified by the thermal leptogenesis without any astrophysical and cosmological problems. Such a light gravitino may be tested in the future 21cm line observations. *",

It is believed that all global symmetries should be broken by quantum gravity effects [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Then, the explicit breaking of the PQ symmetry must be suppressed to an extraordinary degree, otherwise the PQ mechanism cannot explain the small QCD vacuum angle. The other issue is the origin of the PQ symmetry.

One unique prediction of the model is the gravitino with small mass, i.e. m 3/2 100 GeV. In particular, a gravitino mass range of m 3/2 < O(1) eV is consistent with a high reheating temperature, allowing many baryogenesis scenarios typified by the thermal leptogenesis [16] without suffering from neither astrophysical nor cosmological problems [17] [18] [19] .

For example, let us consider a case where the phase transition of \u03a6\u03a6 = 0 occurs before/during inflation while the transition of \u03a6 \u03a6 = 0 takes place after the inflation ends. 16 In the first transition of \u03a6\u03a6 = 0, U (1) B\u2212L symmetry is spontaneously broken, and thus cosmic strings are formed while they are inflated away. In the second transition of \u03a6 \u03a6 = 0, U (1) P Q symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the comic strings are formed. Let us call this string \u03a6 -string. Around the \u03a6 -string with the winding number one, the phase of a 2 /f 2 changes from 0 to 2\u03c0 because the gauge freedom is effectively frozen, since the local strings are inflated away. In this domain, the axion potential gives rise to the energy contrast and the axion distribution crosses the potential minimum two times (see also Fig. 1 ). This shows the \u03a6 -string is attached by two domain walls. Therefore, this case corresponds to the domain wall number two scenario effectively. Similarly, when \u03a6 \u03a6 = 0 takes place during the inflation while \u03a6\u03a6 = 0 does after the inflation ends, the comic strings attached by three domain walls will be formed (\u03a6-string). In the case where both phase transitions occur after inflation, the cosmic string network will become much more complicated due to the coexistence of \u03a6 and \u03a6 -strings. We need detailed numerical analysis in this case, which is beyond the scope of this paper.",

To establish a model, we introduce pairs of the chiral superfields of 5 and5 representations of SU (5) [24, 25] and we assume that the pairs have nontrivial B \u2212 L charges.

Indeed, S couples to the PQ breaking operators,Then, the scalar potential,is obtained, which can make a dangerous contribution to the \u03b8 angle. To solve the quality problem, the gravitino mass must be much smaller than 1 eV which cannot be obtained even in low scale gauge mediation models.The above problematic potential can be suppressed by considering an additional Z 4 discrete gauge symmetry. Let us consider that \u039b is a spectator field 27 with the charge +1 under new Z 4 symmetry 28 and S also has charge +2 under Z 4 . The Higgs fields H u , H d have zero 27 We can consider that \u039b is given by a strong dynamics. For example, let us consider the hidden SU (2) gauge theory with four fundamental representation chiral superfields Q i (i = 1 \u2212 4) with +1 charge under Z 4 and zero charge under Z 6R . Below the dynamical scale of\u039b, the model is described by the composite states of mesons. The mesons may obtain the VEV from the quantum modified constraint.

Let us first consider the case where S obtains the positive Hubble induced mass and sits around the origin during the inflation. After the end of the inflation, it rolls down to the potential minimum of S = S , and then the domain walls are formed by the discrete symmetry breaking of Z 6R into Z 2R .On the other hand, for the negative Hubble induced mass, S obtains the non-zero field value during inflation. After the inflation ends, S starts to roll down, and S will eventually settle down at S = S without crossing the origin by obeying the pseudo-scaling law [76] . 29 Therefore, the domain wall is not formed.
