            "text": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes bluetongue, a major hemorrhagic disease of ruminants. In order to investigate the molecular determinants of BTV virulence, we used a BTV8 strain minimally passaged in tissue culture (termed BTV8 L in this study) and a derivative strain passaged extensively in tissue culture (BTV8 H ) in in vitro and in vivo studies. BTV8 L was pathogenic in both IFNAR \u060a/\u060a mice and in sheep, while BTV8 H was attenuated in both species. To identify genetic changes which led to BTV8 H attenuation, we generated 34 reassortants between BTV8 L and BTV8 H . We found that partial attenuation of BTV8 L in IFNAR \u060a/\u060a mice was achieved by simply replacing genomic segment 2 (Seg2, encoding VP2) or Seg10 (encoding NS3) with the BTV8 H homologous segments. Fully attenuated viruses required at least two genome segments from BTV8 H , including Seg2 with either Seg1 (encoding VP1), Seg6 (encoding VP6 and NS4), or Seg10 (encoding NS3). Conversely, full reversion of virulence of BTV8 H required at least five genomic segments of BTV8 L . We also demonstrated that BTV8 H acquired an increased affinity for glycosaminoglycan receptors during passaging in cell culture due to mutations in its VP2 protein. Replication of BTV8 H was relatively poor in interferon (IFN)-competent primary ovine endothelial cells compared to replication of BTV8 L , and this phenotype was determined by several viral genomic segments, including Seg4 and Seg9. This study demonstrated that multiple viral proteins contribute to BTV8 virulence. VP2 and NS3 are primary determinants of BTV pathogenesis, but VP1, VP5, VP4, VP6, and VP7 also contribute to virulence.",

            "text": "B luetongue is one of the major infectious diseases of ruminants and is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), an arbovirus transmitted by Culicoides spp. (1) (2) (3) . BTV is a member of the Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome of BTV is composed of 10 segments encoding seven structural (VP1 to VP7) and four nonstructural (NS1 to NS4) proteins (4, 5) . The BTV virion is an icosahedral particle assembled in a triple layer of capsid shells (6, 7) . The viral core contains linear dsRNA genomic segments associated with replication complexes formed by three minor proteins, VP1 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), VP4 (capping enzyme including methyltransferase), and VP6 (RNA-dependent ATPase and helicase) enclosed by layers of VP3 (subcore) and VP7 (core) (4, 6, 8, 9) . The outer capsid is formed by two structural proteins, VP2 and VP5, that are responsible for cell attachment and entry (10) (11) (12) . NS1, the largest of the nonstructural proteins, forms tubules in the cytoplasm of BTV-infected cells and is a positive regulator of viral protein synthesis (13) (14) (15) . NS2 is a major component of viral inclusion bodies (VIB) which are the sites of BTV morphogenesis and RNA replication (16) (17) (18) . NS3, the only BTV glycoprotein, is involved in virus exit from infected cells and is thought to play a role in counteracting the innate immune response of the host cell (19) (20) (21) . The recently discovered NS4 is the smallest of the BTV proteins, and it also confers a replication advantage in cells in an antiviral state (5) . At present, there are 26 different BTV serotypes circulating worldwide. The serotype is determined predominantly by VP2, which is the most variable of BTV proteins and a main target of neutralizing antibodies (22) (23) (24) (25) .",

In particular, strains isolated from severe clinical cases and consequently adapted to mammalian tissue culture have been reported to have reduced virulence in experimentally infected animals (33, 38) . Interestingly, a decrease in pathogenicity was shown to occur even in minimally passaged strains and was attributed to a genetic bottleneck that occurs after a single passage in mammalian cells rather than to mutations in the consensus sequence (33) . Conversely, live attenuated vaccines and tissue culture-adapted strains of BTV with a history of multiple passages in vitro show increased accumulation of nucleotide substitutions correlating with increasing numbers of passages in mammalian cells (39) . Genomic segments 1, 2, and 8 (Seg1, Seg2, and Seg8, respectively, encoding VP1, VP2, and NS2) were shown to be consistently mutated in high-passagenumber strains of BTV2, BTV4, and BTV9 viruses and to be attenuated in murine models of bluetongue (39) .",

Samples were analyzed using an Illumina Genome Analyser. The libraries were constructed from the PCR samples using a TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the DNA samples were fragmented, the fragment was end repaired, and the 3= ends were adenylated. After adaptor ligation steps, the fragments were purified by size selection on agarose gel, and the fragments containing adaptors on the 3= and 5= ends were enriched by PCR. Sequencing was performed on a GAIIX sequencer (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genomes were assembled using Maq software (45) with BTV8 L used as a reference sequence. The assemblies were manually curated using Tablet for sequence visualization (46) , and consensus sequences were generated as Fasta files.",

Four monoreassortants showed reduced mortality in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Fig. 3A) . In particular, BTV8 L \u03e9S2 H and BTV8 L \u03e9S10 H caused no mortality in mice at an inoculation dose of 300 PFU and caused 40% mortality with 3,000 PFU. Full attenuation using both inoculation doses was achieved with double reassortants BTV8 L \u03e9S1/2 H (which contains Seg1 and Seg2 of BTV8 H ), BTV8 L \u03e9S2/6 H , and BTV8 L \u03e9S2/10 H . These data suggest that VP2 and NS3 primarily, in addition to VP5 and VP1, were major factors of BTV8 H attenuation in this mouse model. We next aimed to identify the minimal number of BTV8 L segments that would restore full virulence to a reassortant based upon the BTV8 H backbone (Fig. 3B) . None of the single or double reassortants was virulent in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Furthermore, BTV8 H \u03e9S1/2/6/10 L also possessed an attenuated phenotype.

To achieve 100% mouse mortality at an inoculation dose of either 300 or 3,000 PFU, it was required that at least five proteins of BTV8 H be replaced by the BTV8 L equivalents, including either VP4 or VP7 in conjunction with the aforementioned VP1, VP2, VP5, and NS3 (Fig. 3B) .",

Overall, 9 of the 10 monoreassortants displayed similar replication kinetics to those of the parental rgBTV8 L .

We hypothesized that VP2 might have acquired higher affinity for GAGs during passage in tissue culture, given that VP2 is the main determinant of BTV serotype and mediates viral entry (22, 25, 48) . Therefore, we performed viral replication kinetic assays in CHO cells and in a derived cell line (pgsA-745) deficient in xylotransferase and thus lacking heparan sulfate GAGs. rgBTV8 L and a BTV8 H reassortant with the VP2 of BTV8 L (BTV8 H \u03e9S2 L ) grew equally well in both cell lines. However, rgBTV8 H and BTV8 L \u03e9S2 H reached approximately 10-fold higher titers in CHO cells (P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 5A) and induced a more pronounced cytopathic effect (Fig. 5B ) than rgBTV8 L and BTV8 H \u03e9S2 L , respectively. Hence, BTV8 H VP2 has a higher affinity for GAGs and facilitates BTV8 replication in vitro but not in vivo.",

The data described above, showed that the reduced replication kinetics of rgBTV8 H , BTV8 L \u03e9S4 H , and BTV8 L \u03e9S9 H in OvEC were not due to increased IFN induction in these cells. In light of these data, we wanted to establish whether rgBTV8 L , rgBTV8 H , and the rgBTV8 L /rgBTV8 H reassortants were better or worse equipped to overcome restriction in cells already in an antiviral state prior to infection. For these experiments, we used CPT-Tert cells as they do not produce IFN but can respond to IFN treatment (5, 40) . We pretreated CPT-Tert with either 1,000 units of UIFN or control medium for 18 h prior to infection with rgBTV8 L , rgBTV8 H , and monoreassortants with a BTV8 L backbone at an MOI of 0.01. At 48 h p.i. supernatants of infected cells were collected and titrated by endpoint dilution analysis. Comparison of viral yields in cells treated and untreated with UIFN showed that the replication of all viruses was inhibited by at least 100-fold by UIFN (P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 8) . The reduction in yield of rgBTV8 L in UIFN-treated cells compared to that in untreated cells was approximately (5 \u03eb 10 3 )fold. Strikingly, this ratio was more than a millionfold (1.7 \u03eb 10 6 ) for rgBTV8 H . In UIFN-treated cells, most reassortants reached yields similar to those obtained by rgBTV8 L under the same conditions. A notable exception was BTV8 L \u03e9S4 H , which had yields 10-fold lower than those of rgBTV8 L (P \u03fd 0.05) in the UIFNtreated samples. BTV8 L \u03e9S2 H showed the highest degree of inhibition in treated CPT-Tert cells among all 10 monoreassortants. However, the yield of BTV8 L \u03e9S2 H in treated cells was equivalent to the one obtained by rgBTV8 L under the same conditions.",

We found that nonsynonymous mutations in four segments (Seg1, -2, -6, and -10) encoding VP1, VP2, VP5, and NS3 contributed to the attenuation of BTV8 in vivo in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Reassortants where segments encoding the VP2 or NS3 of the attenuated rgBTV8 H were used in the context of the virulent rgBTV8 L backbone caused no mortality in mice inoculated at the lower dose (300 PFU) used in this study.

Interestingly, Seg2 with either Seg1, Seg6, or Seg10 of rgBTV8 L did not restore virulence in the rgBTV8 H backbone. The fact that a degree of virulence in rgBTV8 H was achieved only after combining Seg7 with Seg2, Seg6, and Seg10 of rgBTV8 L might suggest that interactions between specific viral proteins (or genomic segments) could play a role in the pathogenicity of BTV. Both VP2 and VP5 have previously been shown to interact with VP7 trimers in BTV virions (52) . Additionally, other studies demonstrated the importance of NS3 interactions with outer capsid proteins in virus trafficking and assembly (19, 53) . It is therefore possible that while mutations in high-passage-number VP5 or VP7 did not directly affect the functions of these proteins, they did influence virus virulence through their interactions with VP2 and NS3.",

This external and highly exposed area of VP2 was also implicated in attachment to a host cell receptor, and the mutations that arise in this region could be due to the changes in affinity for binding to specific ligands (10) . Cryo-electron microscopy showed that VP2 possesses a sialic acid binding region located in its hub domain, which is one of two sites suggested to interact with the cell surface receptor (10) .

However, it is most likely that other viral factors that are used to counteract the IFN system contribute to BTV virulence. Pathogenicity studies of multiple reassortants in sheep are not feasible; hence, we used primary OvEC as an in vitro surrogate model to identify the genome segments that confer higher sensitivity to the cell-autonomous IFN response. BTV8 H (and its derivative rescued by reverse genetics) replicated poorly in primary cells. These data showed that the IFN response played a role in the inhibition of BTV8 H replication. Both BTV8 L and BTV8 H induced similar amounts of IFN in infected primary cells. These data suggest that primary OvEC sense and respond to infection with both viruses in a similar manner but that BTV8 L was able to counteract this response better than BTV8 H .",

Two notable exceptions included BTV8 L \u03e9S4 H and BTV8 L \u03e9S9 H . However, the VP4 (encoded by Seg4) of BTV8 H also influenced the viral phenotype in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice, suggesting that mutations in this protein could also have affected its functions unrelated to the type I IFN response. VP4 of BTV acts as a capping enzyme, and therefore the mutations in VP4 H and, in particular, the mutation in the amino acid residue at position 332 of the predicted 2=-O-methyltransferase (2= OMTase) domain could have an adverse effect on the efficiency of viral mRNA capping (69, 70) . Moreover, recent studies have shown that viral mRNA that lacks 2=-O-methylation at its 5= cap structure induces a more potent innate immune response through MDA5 activation or direct interactions with proteins members of the IFIT (interferon-inducible protein with tetratricopeptide repeats) family (71) (72) (73) . An inefficient capping mechanism would therefore explain the slight, yet consistent, decrease in virus yields reached by BTV8 L \u03e9S4 H in IFN-deficient CPT-Tert cells and the more pronounced growth inhibition in OvEC. This hypothesis was further supported by comparing the growth kinetics of monoreassortants in the BTV8 L backbone in CPT-Tert cells either untreated or pretreated with UIFN. Of all reassortants, BTV8 L \u03e9S4 H showed the lowest yields in UIFN-pretreated cells, which suggested that VP4 H was one of the proteins contributing to the inability of rgBTV8 H to replicate in cells primed with IFN. These data are in concordance with other studies showing that West Nile virus, coronaviruses, and poxviruses mutants with deficient 2= OMTase activity were not able to escape IFIT-2 induced restriction in cells stably expressing IFIT-2 (72) . It is therefore possible that through viral mRNA capping, the VP4 of BTV8 could play a role in evading host restriction factors in order to allow the virus to replicate in host cells in an antiviral state.",

We found no mutations in the NS4 open reading frame, but we detected a nonsynonymous mutation in VP6 (RNA-dependent ATPase and helicase). We are not aware of viral helicases being involved in interactions with the innate immune system. We noticed a slight reduction in the replication kinetics of BTV8 L \u03e9S9 H (compared to those of BTV8 L ) in CPT-Tert cells.

This indicated that mutations in segments other than Seg4 and Seg6 contributed to the restricted replication of the high-passage-number virus. Altogether, these data reinforce the concept that passaging viruses in an environment with no constraints from the IFN system allows greater flexibility of the viral genome, which in turn leads to the emergence of viruses with optimal replication efficiencies. The mutations that arise under such conditions might not necessarily involve major IFN antagonists but can involve proteins that are normally fine-tuned to evoke a minimal immune response while allowing sufficient (yet suboptimal) transmission in the natural host (74) . A recent study looking into interserotype determinants of BTV pathogenesis in sheep showed that replacement of BTV1 Seg2, -6, and -10 with homologous BTV8 segments resulted in reassortants that showed a similar phenotype in sheep as BTV8 (51) . However, this study was performed using BTV1 and BTV8 serotypes that are both virulent in sheep. Consequently, a clear distinction between levels of pathogenicity of the parental viruses and their reassortants was difficult to assess.",
