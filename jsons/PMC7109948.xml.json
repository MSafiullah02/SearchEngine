For capturing, a considerable pressure has to be exerted (higher than when shaking hands), and the total time of finger to surface contact for scanning 10 fingers in three capturing sets is approximately 20 seconds.

The laboratory transfer studies on hepatitis A virus and rhinovirus were conducted by a finger pad experiment, in which metal disks were contaminated with 10 \u03bcL viral suspensions in concentrations equal to those in affected patients. After drying, these disks were applied to finger pads, with contact surface and contact times of 1 to 3 cm2 and 5 to 10 seconds, respectively. Transmission efficiency ranged from 0.7% to 16%, and the quantities transferred were invariably higher than the infectious dose.\n23,35\nIn terms of transmission efficiency, the conditions of fingerprint capturing (2 \u00d7 20 cm2 and 20 s, respectively) are even more favorable. The high contact pressure during fingerprinting is an additional factor: experiments showed that a high pressure (1.0 kg/cm2, as with hand shaking and opening of doors) resulted in a three times higher amount of hepatitis A virus transfer compared to low (0.2 kg/cm2) pressure.\n35\nIn addition to these laboratory experiments, a \u201creal\u2010life\u201d study illustrated the potential of transfer through hand\u2013fomite contact: in a flat shared by four students, a surrogate virus was applied on the door handle of the living room.

Within 6 hours, all occupants as well as visitors were infected.\n62\nAnother study examined the houses of infants who were recently vaccinated for polio (during which time shedding occurs in feces): the presence of virus was demonstrated in up to 13% of bathroom, living room, and kitchen sites. Most frequently contaminated were hand contact sites such as bathroom taps, door handles, toilet flushes, liquid soap dispensers, diaper\u2010changing equipment, and potties.\n24",

Although it is difficult to compare the risks, we think that in daily life, the particular conditions of fingerprinting (large contact surface, large overlap, high contact pressure, and long contact time) are not frequently met. Moreover, anecdotal evidence linking acquisition of hospital pathogens to fomites in the community raises the issue of implementation of control measures in certain community settings. For instance, carriage of multiresistant S aureus in a nurse was linked to contamination of a computer desk and joystick at home and not eliminated until the computer\u2010related hardware was decontaminated.\n63\nFinally, fingerprinting in the present setting is a mandatory act (without fingerprinting, visa application is refused) for which risks as perceived by the public are higher compared to voluntary acts.\n64",

Hand washing with water and plain soap has virtually no activity against nonenveloped viruses, and antimicrobial soaps based on chlorhexidine or triclosan have only a limited activity.\n21\nAlcohol\u2010based hand rubs have superior activity and are better tolerated than antimicrobial soaps. Their use is simple: approximately 3 mL of alcohol rub is applied in the palm of the hand. Next, the hands are rubbed together covering all the surfaces of the hands, and hands are further rubbed until they are dry. There is no need for running water, sink, or drying facilities. Compared to the other alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, ethanol in high concentrations had a superior activity on nonenveloped viruses and retains enough activity against bacterial pathogens.\n21",

In addition, the performance and acceptability of hand rubbing by the general public will be assessed as well as the compliance with the control measures by the operating staff. On medium\u2010length term, improvements in design and construction of the devices are expected. The split under the U\u2010shaped plastic board of the present fingerprint capturer hinders cleaning and allows the buildup of dirt and moisture, which inactivates disinfectants and allows microorganisms to survive. Newly designed devices should also withstand the corroding or decolorizing effects of disinfectants. Other possibilities should be technically explored, such as disposable transparent covers over the contact surface or a removable surface contact plate that can be detached and soaked into a disinfecting solution. Alternatively, so\u2010called touchless systems (which capture fingerprints without making physical contact with the optical surface) might be considered.",
