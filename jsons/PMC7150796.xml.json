However, flaviviruses often escape antivirals that target specific viral proteins because of the high mutation rates [15].

Here, we explore the antiviral activity of benzavir-2 against flaviviruses that urgently need effective therapeutic interventions. We used a Zoanthus species green fluorescence protein (ZsGreen), expressing infectious ZIKV as a primary tool to study anti-flavivirus activity and then expanding it to investigate the effect on wild-type (wt) ZIKV and several other pathogenic flaviviruses. The antiviral activity of benzavir-2 was compared with the activity of other antiviral drugs, favipiravir, and ribavirin, which were recently reported to display antiviral activity against flaviviruses [20]. This study demonstrated potent antiviral activity of benzavir-2 against flaviviruses and thus added a new group of viruses to its broad spectrum of antiviral activity.",

Hence, we set the maximum concentration for toxicity assessment to 100 \u00b5M for all compounds. The Vero B4 cell toxicity was analyzed 24 h post-treatment using a resazurin-based toxicity test, which is a colorimetric assay that measures the metabolic activity of living cells [32]. All compounds displayed cell viability well above 50% at the highest concentration of 100 \u00b5M, thus, no CC50 value could be measured and no selectivity index (SI) could be presented (Table 1).",

The formation of plaques corresponds to a full infection cycle, from entry to egress of newly-formed viral particles. Based on the dose-response activity against the rZIKV-ZsGreen vector (Figure 2 and Table 1), we conducted a plaque formation assay in a dose-dependent manner by using benzavir-2 (from 20 to 0.6 \u00b5M) and ribavirin (from 200 to 6.3 \u00b5M) to observe plaque forming inhibition against the more clinically relevant wt ZIKV Asian lineage (BeH819015, Brazil strain). After 4 days of ZIKV infection, the Vero B4 cells were fixed and plaques were visualized by crystal violet staining and then quantified. Benzavir-2 showed significant reduction of plaque formation at all applied concentrations, while ribavirin only showed inhibition of plaque formation at 200 \u00b5M (Figure 3A). To further investigate benzavir-2 inhibition against other wt ZIKV lineages, we treated the African lineage (MR766, Uganda strain) with benzavir-2 at 2.5 \u00b5M. It showed a significant reduction of plaque formation, 94% reduction for the African lineage and 88% reduction for Asian lineage (Figure 3). ",

Based on the growth kinetics of rZIKV-ZsGreen and the sensitivity of the ZsGreen detection in the fluorescent intensity assay, the analysis of virus infection was performed 24 h post-infection, and a 2-h treatment scheme with benzavir-2 at a relatively high concentration (10 \u00b5M) was selected (Figure 5A). When benzavir-2 was added at 2\u20134 h post-infection (hpi), the inhibitory effect was most pronounced, while the binding and entry steps (0\u20132 h) were less affected. Addition of benzavir-2 at later time-points post-infection also showed less inhibition. Although pre-incubation of the cells with benzavir-2 prior to infection (\u22122 h) had an inhibitory effect; it was much lower compared to the addition of benzavir-2 in the early phase (2\u20134 h) of infection (Figure 5B).",

            "text": "Flaviviruses share several common cellular factors in their infectious cycle that might specifically be targeted by benzavir-2 [1,13,44]. Our previous findings of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity for benzavir-2, inhibiting both DNA and RNA viruses, indicated that benzavir-2 could act on a host cell target(s). To elucidate where in the ZIKV infectious cycle this target(s) could be present, we performed a time-of-addition analysis. It revealed that benzavir-2 was most effective at the early time-points of the ZIKV infectious cycle and did not inhibit the binding or entry to the same extent. The most pronounced inhibition was found when benzavir-2 was present between 2 to 4 h after infection, which could indicate an effect on protein translation and protein maturation or early replication and assembly of replication vesicles in the ZIKV infectious cycle. Previously, we performed similar time-of-addition analysis of benzavir-2 on RVFV [19]. There, the most pronounced inhibition was also in the early time-points, more precise between 0 and 2 h after infection. This indicated that RVFV binding, endocytosis, primary transcription, or protein translation might be inhibited. The discrepancy of the timing of benzavir-2 activity between RVFV and ZIKV might be explained by the difference in kinetics between the two viruses. RVFV is known to have a more rapid infectious cycle compared to ZIKV, hence possibly utilizes the target(s) that benzavir-2 acts upon earlier [45,46]. It also indicated that benzavir-2 was not interfering with general endocytosis and infection and might not inhibit membrane rearrangements needed in the ER for flavivirus replication as the negative stranded RNA virus RVFV does not share this feature [47].
