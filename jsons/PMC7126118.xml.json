One recent commentary even questions whether the 40S ribosomal subunit has anything to do with it (Mathews, 2002). The easiest answer is that the stop-scanning step is clearly mediated by pairing of the initiation codon with the anticodon in Met-tRNAi (Cigan et al., 1988a), and the 40S ribosomal subunit is the carrier of Met-tRNAi eIF2. But the 40S subunit was already implicated by experiments done earlier.",

Analysis of the rapidly sedimenting complexes revealed 40S ribosomal subunits distributed throughout the body of the mRNA. Because control experiments showed that, even in the presence of edeine, ribosomes can enter only from the 5\u2032 end, the simplest explanation was that 40S subunits enter at the 5\u2032 end and then migrate into the interior of the mRNA; in the absence of edeine, the migration would stop when an AUG codon is reached. Independent experiments confirmed that edeine is targeted to the ribosome (Herrera et al., 1986), and use of a fractionated translation system confirmed that the edeine-induced complexes are formed by 40S but not 60S ribosomal subunits (Kozak and Shatkin, 1978, Kozak, 1979b). Subsequent experiments, with edeine omitted, showed that scanning can be interrupted by inserting a base-paired structure between the cap and the AUG codon; the resulting abortive complexes sediment around 40S (Kozak, 1989, Kozak, 1998, Paraskeva et al., 1999).",

            "text": "We are not yet sure which initiation factors are associated with the 40S ribosomal subunit during the scanning phase. The only factors whose role in scanning has been defined clearly are the GTP-binding protein eIF2, which escorts Met-tRNAi onto the 40S subunit, and eIF5, which activates GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 (Asano et al., 2001, Das et al., 2001). By controlling the rate of GTP hydrolysis, eIF5 controls the fidelity of initiation, i.e. the fidelity of the stop-scanning step (Huang et al., 1997). Other protein factors have not yet been fitted in. (The voluminous literature on factors focuses on modifications \u2013 phosphorylation, cleavages \u2013 rather than on defining the initiation pathway. Basic questions, such as when each factor enters and leaves, have not yet been answered.) One untested possibility is that the large initiation factor eIF3, bound to the 40S ribosomal subunit, might form a clamp around the mRNA that is opened and closed by cycles of ATP hydrolysis. Scanning appears to be dependent on ATP hydrolysis (Kozak, 1980), thereby implicating eIF4A, an RNA-dependent ATPase which might control the hypothetical clamp. Some ideas about the function of other initiation factors are reviewed elsewhere (Dever, 2002, McCarthy, 1998, Pestova et al., 2001).",

These well-defined mechanisms for escaping the first-AUG rule are discussed below. An additional escape mechanism might involve direct entry of ribosomes at an internal site in the mRNA. While there is evidence suggestive of direct internal initiation with picornavirus mRNAs, the evidence for internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) in cellular mRNAs is problematic (Kozak, 2001a). The absence of shared structural features among candidate cellular IRES elements makes it impossible to predict which mRNAs, if any, might use such a mechanism. Rather than attempting to summarize the extensive literature on internal initiation, I refer the reader to other detailed reviews on that subject (Dever, 2002, Hellen and Sarnow, 2001, Pestova et al., 2001).",

The problem of how ribosomes can gain access to an internal start codon is solved by producing, via splicing or a downstream promoter, a second form of mRNA from which the first AUGSTART codon has been removed. Table 2\nlists some examples. The N-terminally truncated isoform thus produced may reside in a different cellular compartment, or may function as an antagonist to the full-length protein (as seen with various transcription factors listed in Table 2), or may function in a surprising way. One such surprise was the discovery that a truncated form of tryptophanyl-tRNA-synthetase (\u2018miniTrpRS\u2019) has angiostatic activity (Wakasugi et al., 2002).",

Vertebrate mRNAs characteristically have long, GC-rich \u2013 hence highly structured \u2013 leader sequences (Kozak, 1991a, Macleod et al., 1998), and the resulting difficulty in translation has been discovered over and over in the course of cloning. Even a short GC-rich 5\u2032 UTR can inhibit profoundly, as illustrated in cases where a gene produces a mixture of mRNAs with different leader sequences, and the worst-translated mRNA was found to be the form with the shortest 5\u2032 UTR (Jiang and Lucy, 2001, Yang et al., 1998). A stem-and-loop structure, stabilized in some cases by a repressor protein, is most inhibitory when its proximity to the 5\u2032 end blocks ribosome binding (Goossen and Hentze, 1992, Kozak, 1989, Wang and Wessler, 2001). If the structure is far enough from the 5\u2032 end to allow ribosome entry, the advancing 40S ribosome/factor complex apparently has some ability to disrupt base pairing, but this ability is notably less than that of 80S elongating ribosomes (Kozak, 1986a, Kozak, 2001b, Lingelbach and Dobberstein, 1988, Paraskeva et al., 1999) and is curtailed in yeast (Koloteva et al., 1997).",

Interpretation of in vivo tests of translation could also be complicated by effects of secondary structure on mRNA stability (Stefanovic et al., 1999).

It is not uncommon, however, for initiation to occur at an upstream non-AUG codon in addition to the first AUG (see leaky scanning in Section 3).

That advice is not changed by what is written here. Very often, cDNA sequences that appear incompatible with scanning have been found to derive from incompletely spliced transcripts or to have been misinterpreted in other ways (Kozak, 1996, Kozak, 2000). In other cases, although an encumbered cDNA sequence is correct, it derives from a transcript that does not support translation (Hake and Hecht, 1993, Han et al., 2002, Larsen et al., 2002, Lee et al., 2000). Only after one is certain of the mRNA structure should the mechanisms below be considered.",

This leaky scanning enables the production of two separately initiated proteins from one mRNA, as documented below. It is harder to predict what happens at start sites that fall between the extremes, i.e. mRNAs in which the first potential start codon has the sequence YNNaugG, GNNaugY or GNNaugA. Leaky scanning is seen in some but not all such cases. A possible explanation suggested by studies with test transcripts (Kozak, 1990a) is that initiation might be restricted to the first AUG codon, despite a suboptimal context, when downstream secondary structure slows scanning and thus provides more time for codon/anticodon pairing. Suppression of leaky scanning via this mechanism requires a critical distance (13\u201315 nt, which corresponds to half the diameter of the ribosome) between the AUG codon and the downstream structured element.",

The postulated link between context and leaky scanning has been tested in many of these cases by showing that, upon improving the context at the upstream site, initiation from the second site is reduced or abolished. (Whether the second AUG codon resides in a strong or weak context is not relevant; the ribosome reads the mRNA linearly and thus the decision to stop or to bypass the first AUG is not influenced by whether there is a better initiation site downstream.) The large number of genes that employ leaky scanning precludes discussion of the biological significance of the proteins thereby produced, but it merits noting that, for many of the viruses in Table 3, replication requires production of both listed proteins. For some other viruses, the second protein is a virulence factor that weakens host defenses (Bridgen et al., 2001, Chen et al., 2001, Weber et al., 2002). The biological importance of these downstream-initiated proteins shows that leaky scanning is a deliberately employed tool; it does not simply reflect sloppiness on the part of the translational machinery.",

The observation that trans-splicing of mRNAs in C.\nelegans sometimes brings a purine into position \u22123 is interesting (Hough et al., 1999) but the significance awaits testing. With a number of yeast genes, there is a hint of leaky scanning when the usual A in position \u22123 is replaced by a pyrimidine (Gaba et al., 2001, Slusher et al., 1991, Vilela et al., 1998, Welch and Jacobson, 1999, Wolfe et al., 1994). Context effects were not evident, however, in other studies of translation in yeast (Cigan et al., 1988b). For whatever reason, leaky scanning is rare in yeast, apart from a few cases attributable to the first AUG codon residing too close to the 5\u2032 end.",

Although the first AUG codon has the required A in position \u22123, a small percentage of ribosomes bypass that site and initiate at the next AUG, producing a third (50 kDa) form of c-myc.

Translation of C/EBP\u03b1 mRNA occurs by a mechanism similar to that depicted for C/EBP\u03b2 except that the first start site in C/EBP\u03b1 is a CUG codon (Calkhoven et al., 2000), which generates a smaller amount of the longest protein (isoform A) than does the AUG codon in C/EBP\u03b2.

Use of a weak (non-AUG) codon to initiate ORF1 and an unfavorable context at the start of ORF2 (UACaugA) enables the majority of ribosomes to reach and initiate at the start of ORF3. The ORF3 polyprotein is thought to be a precursor from which coat protein, protease and reverse transcriptase are derived by proteolysis. The remarkable absence of AUG codons from the long (563 nt) coding domain of ORF1 and the presence of but one weak AUG codon within ORF2 underscore how carefully this mRNA is constructed to support translation via scanning. The careful construction includes minimizing the overlap between adjacent cistrons. Without that precaution, elongational occlusion might work against utilization of a far downstream start codon, as documented in other cases (Kozak, 1995).",

The explanation is that the context flanking the first AUGSTART codon is good but\nnot\nperfect. The resulting low-level leaky scanning enables the viruses depicted in Fig. 2A,B to produce two proteins \u2013 one abundant, the second in small amounts \u2013 from a single mRNA. Experimental manipulations that support this interpretation are summarized in the legend to Fig. 2. A few other viral genes that might fit this category have been described (Chenik et al., 1995, Jayakar and Whitt, 2002). The hepatitis B virus example is noteworthy because, via the Rube Goldberg mechanism diagrammed in Fig. 2B, reverse transcriptase encoded by the P gene is initiated independently from a far downstream site, unlike most other reverse transcriptase genes which lack an independent start codon and therefore require frameshifting during translation of the preceding core gene.",

A similar mechanism might operate with a few other cellular genes that produce a trace amount of a second protein isoform (Liu et al., 2000, Short and Pfarr, 2002; it is not clear whether leaky scanning or a change in splicing underlies the translational switch described by Land and Rouault, 1998).",

For the downstream reinitiation event to occur, the 40S subunit must reacquire Met-tRNAi and this appears to be an important point of control. Reacquisition of Met-tRNAi is promoted by lengthening the intercistronic domain (Abastado et al., 1991, Kozak, 1987c), which provides more time for Met-tRNAi to bind, or by increasing the concentration of eIF2 (Abastado et al., 1991, Hinnebusch, 1997). Genetic experiments also implicate eIF3 in the Met-tRNAi rebinding step (Garcia-Barrio et al., 1995). Another potential point of control is at the termination site of the upORF, where certain features \u2013 perhaps nearby secondary structure (Grant and Hinnebusch, 1994, Vilela et al., 1998) \u2013 might prevent the resumption of scanning or, in some other way, prevent reinitiation. This brief summary is based on studies carried out in yeast and mammals. Some studies of reinitiation in plants suggest that the intercistronic sequence may have effects beyond simply providing time for ribosomes to reacquire Met-tRNA (Wang and Wessler, 1998).",

            "text": "The size of the first ORF is a major limitation on reinitiation in eukaryotes: reinitiation can occur following the translation of a \u2018minicistron\u2019 (a small first ORF) but not following the translation of a full-length 5\u2032 cistron. The long list of mRNAs that contain silent 3\u2032 cistrons (Table 1) underscores the point. The only apparent exception occurs with cauliflower mosaic virus, where a protein encoded by the virus appears to promote reinitiation following the translation of a full-length first cistron (Park et al., 2001). The reason why reinitiation is usually restricted by the size of the first ORF is not known, but a possible explanation is that certain initiation factors dissociate from the ribosome only gradually during the course of elongation. If the elongation phase is brief \u2013 i.e. if the first ORF is a minicistron \u2013 the factors required for reinitiation would still be present when the 40S subunit resumes scanning. Although the postulated factors have not been identified, there is evidence for the idea that the duration of the elongation phase matters: when a short upORF which normally permits reinitiation was reconfigured to contain a pseudoknot that is known to slow elongation, reinitiation failed (Kozak, 2001b). That result makes it difficult to specify a cutoff size, i.e. one cannot say \u2018an upORF this long will allow reinitiation\u2019 while a longer ORF will not. The permissible size is likely to vary depending on features, such as secondary structure or codon usage, that affect the rate of elongation. As a rough guide, however, one may note that reinitiation often has been observed following translation of a ten to 12 codon upORF, and that reinitiation was substantially reduced, but not abolished, when a 13 codon upORF was lengthened to 33 codons (Kozak, 2001b). In a different study, reinitiation occurred following a 24 codon upORF but not when the ORF was lengthened to 40 codons (Luukkonen et al., 1995).",

That the size of the upORF might be what limits translation of AdoMetDC is suggested from the five-fold increase in translation observed when the upORF was shortened from 53 to 25 codons, but that result could also be explained in other ways. (The suggested interpretation is not contradicted by the fact that an alternative upORF in AdoMetDC mRNA caused little inhibition even when lengthened to 66 codons; the alternative upORF initiates from an AUG codon in a weak context which would allow it to be bypassed to some extent by leaky scanning. The 53 codon upORF, in contrast, has a strong start codon.)",

In a series of classic experiments, Hinnebusch (1997) was able to reconstruct GCN4 regulation using only the first and fourth upORFs, and I will explain what happens in that simplified case. UpORF1 is always translated efficiently (it is the first AUG in the mRNA), after which ribosomes resume scanning and reinitiate, usually, at upORF4. UpORF4 is unusual in that its translation precludes further reinitiation events: thus, when upORF4 is translated, GCN4 is not. That is the situation in yeast cultures that have adequate nutrients. Starvation for amino acids, however, causes some ribosomes to bypass the inhibitory upORF4 and reinitiate instead farther downstream. This happens because starvation creates a pool of uncharged tRNAs which activate a protein kinase that phosphorylates, and thus partially inactivates, eIF2. When eIF2 levels fall, it takes longer for ribosomes to reacquire Met-tRNAi and thus become competent to reinitiate. The slower acquisition of competence means that some ribosomes, scanning in the reinitiation mode, will bypass the nearby upORF4 and can thus reach the downstream GCN4 start site.",

(i) Fig. 3A lists some examples of mammalian mRNAs that are translated inefficiently due to small upORFs; many other examples were cited in Section 4.2. (ii) Experimental manipulations with C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA (Fig. 1B) support the interpretation that an AUG codon which follows the upORF too closely is skipped (presumably because ribosomes have not yet reacquired Met-tRNAi), allowing reinitiation to occur farther downstream. The same mechanism might be invoked to explain how an internal start codon is accessed in miniTrpRS mRNA (Wakasugi et al., 2002) and baculovirus IE0 mRNA (Theilmann et al., 2001), and how c-myb gets translated from a rearranged transcript generated by retrovirus insertion (Jiang et al., 1997). In each of these mRNAs, the first AUG codon that follows a small upORF must be bypassed to reach the functional start codon downstream. (iii) The third lesson from GCN4 pertains to regulation of reinitiation by manipulation of eIF2 levels. Although hints of this have been described with mammalian genes that encode C/EBP transcription factors (Calkhoven et al., 2000), macrophage receptor protein CD36 (Griffin et al., 2001) and activating transcription factor 4 (Harding et al., 2000), the point requires much more careful study.",

Translation of TPO normally initiates at AUG#8 in exon 3, but a splice-site mutation that causes deletion of exon 3 causes initiation to shift to a previously silent in-frame codon (AUG#9) in exon 4; this is diagrammed in the center of Fig. 4. The resulting truncated form of TPO lacks only the first four amino acids and appears to function normally (Wiestner et al., 1998). The problem \u2013 the cause of the pathology \u2013 is that the mutation greatly increases translation of TPO by removing the inhibitory upORF7. In two other families affected with hereditary thrombocythemia, production of TPO is elevated by mutations that restructure upORF7. In one case, deletion of a G residue shifts upORF7 into the same reading frame as TPO, thereby causing overproduction of an elongated form of TPO initiated from AUG#7 (Ghilardi and Skoda, 1999, Kondo et al., 1998). In the other case, a G\u2192T mutation creates a terminator codon within upORF7 and this shortening of the ORF, which now terminates 31 nt before AUG#8, enables efficient reinitiation at AUG#8 (Ghilardi et al., 1999).",

Ribosomes that translate the upORF thereby miss the first in-frame AUG codon but proceed to reinitiate at another start codon downstream. If the upORF itself has a suboptimal initiation site (U in position \u22123 in the depicted example), leaky scanning will allow some production of the long protein isoform from the first in-frame AUG codon while the reinitiation shunt promotes production of the shorter protein isoform. The operation of a reinitiation shunt is most obvious when the upORF overlaps a potential start codon, as shown in Fig. 3C, but the same principle applies in cases (discussed in Section 4.3) where, although the upORF terminates prior to a potential downstream start codon, the intervening distance is too short to allow reinitiation.",

Mammalian AdoMetDC mRNA is the best studied example in which a small upORF encodes a peptide which functions in cis to inhibit downstream translation. The nascent peptide (MAGDIS) produced during translation of the upORF is thought to interact with ribosomes in a way that prevents completion of the termination process and thus prevents reinitiation (Law et al., 2001). The stalled ribosome, held at the termination site of the upORF, would also block other ribosomes from reaching the downstream start site via leaky scanning. Biologically, this mechanism is important because AdoMetDC is a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis and, at least in vitro, elevated polyamine levels stabilize the ribosome complex stalled at the end of the upORF (Law et al., 2001). In other words, elevated polyamine levels down-regulate translation of AdoMetDC. It is interesting to note parenthetically that antizyme, a protein that down-regulates polyamine levels, is also translated via a polyamine-sensitive mechanism. Elevated polyamine levels up-regulate production of antizyme by promoting a ribosomal frameshift needed to translate the full-length protein (Ivanov et al., 2000).",

There are other cases in which a reinitiation mechanism kicks in only when a nonsense mutation is introduced in a way that truncates the coding domain. In effect, the normal AUG initiator codon becomes the start of an upORF, following which reinitiation occurs at a normally silent internal AUG codon (Chang and Gould, 1998, Ledley et al., 1990, Zoppi et al., 1993). The N-terminally truncated protein thus produced sometimes retains enough function to mitigate the pathological effects of the nonsense mutation (Chang and Gould, 1998). This potential rescue device often fails, however, because many mRNAs are rapidly degraded when a nonsense codon is introduced (Frischmeyer and Dietz, 1999, He and Jacobson, 2001). The mRNA decay pathway that targets these abnormal mRNAs is activated in part by cis elements located in the coding domain (Gudikote and Wilkinson, 2002), which might explain why normal upORF-containing mRNAs (e.g. those discussed in Fig. 3, Fig. 4) are not rapidly degraded.",

Other considerations, such as codon usage, might prevent an increase in translation even when the context is improved (i.e. translation might be limited at the level of elongation rather than initiation), and some mutations near the AUG codon might affect mRNA processing or stability rather than translation per se. A clinically relevant polymorphism in position \u22121 of annexin V appears to have an effect on translation which is inconsistent with the context rules (Gonz\u00e1lez-Conejero et al., 2002), but the effect was small and documented only by assaying translation in vitro, which is not always reliable (Section 6.2). A natural polymorphism in position \u22125 of the glycoprotein Ib\u03b1 gene displayed a small effect on translation in vitro that was consistent with the rules (C worked better than T; Afshar-Kharghan et al., 1999) but, in the same study, mutations that changed position +4 from C to G did not augment translation. Testing mutations in position +4 is tricky, however, because the change in identity of the penultimate amino acid might affect protein stability in ways that obscure the effects on translation. The solution is to use an assay that directly monitors the initiation step of translation (Kozak, 1997).",

In the case of a mutated vasopressin gene in which the G of the AUGSTART codon is deleted, the shorter signal peptide initiated from the second AUG codon is not recognized by signal peptidase (Beuret et al., 1999). The resulting uncleaved vasopressin-precursor protein folds incorrectly, causing subsequent processing steps to fail, and therefore vasopressin never gets released from the endoplasmic reticulum.

            "text": "I have already explained how hereditary thrombocythemia is caused by mutations that elevate translation of TPO by restructuring or eliminating an inhibitory upORF (Fig. 4). Translation of proto-oncogenes is also elevated in some cases by eliminating small upORFs from the mRNA. The MDM2 oncogene is one example: whereas the normal mRNA has a long 5\u2032 UTR that includes two upstream AUG codons, in tumor cells the use of a different promoter eliminates the upstream AUGs and thus increases translational efficiency 20-fold (Brown et al., 1999, Landers et al., 1997). In the case of oncogene GLI1, the upstream AUG codons that restrict translation in normal cells reside in an intron which is eliminated by more efficient splicing in basal cell carcinomas (Wang and Rothnagel, 2001). Translation of many other human or rodent oncogenes is restricted in normal cells by an encumbered (AUG-burdened or GC-rich) leader sequence (Arrick et al., 1991, Bates et al., 1991, Child et al., 1999a, Harigai et al., 1996, Hoover et al., 1997, Horvath et al., 1995, Manzella and Blackshear, 1990, Sarrazin et al., 2000); in some of these cases, a shorter 5\u2032 UTR that better supports translation is produced in transformed cells (Arrick et al., 1994, Marth et al., 1988). For other oncogenes, although there are alternative leader sequences that might regulate expression in normal tissues (Link et al., 1992, Sasahara et al., 1998), there is no evidence that switching leader sequences contributes to tumorigenesis.",

A striking example of translational inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene is seen in some individuals with a predisposition to melanoma. In certain families, a point mutation (G\u2192T) creates an upstream, out-of-frame AUG codon in the CDKN2 gene (Liu et al., 1999). The small upORF initiated from this new AUG codon overlaps the CDKN2 start codon, and the resulting inhibition of translation is profound.",

(2000) speculate that human polyomavirus JC might cause persistent rather than acute infection because all capsid-protein encoding transcripts produced by the JC virus have a small upORF. With the related simian virus 40, in contrast, the upORF is sometimes eliminated by splicing, generating transcripts that better support translation of the major capsid protein. Attenuating effects caused by introducing an upstream AUG codon have been described also with other viruses (Petty et al., 1990, Slobodskaya et al., 1996).",

In another study, a potent tumor rejection peptide, which maps to an internal AUG codon in the full-length cDNA, was expressed experimentally from a truncated cDNA wherein the start codon for the antigenic peptide was made the first AUG (Rosenberg et al., 2002). Additional analyses are needed to determine whether, in the melanoma cells wherein this antigen is expressed naturally, a transcript similar to the experimentally truncated cDNA is produced via a downstream promoter or splice site.",

The occasional survey that purports to challenge the context rules involves distortions, such as emphasizing the low percentage of cDNAs that have the full consensus sequence while ignoring the high percentage of cDNAs that have the critical purine in position \u22123 (Peri and Pandey, 2001). A major uncertainty pertaining to all cDNA surveys concerns the validity of the database. When I re-examined the entries in one study (Suzuki et al., 2000), I found numerous instances in which the AUGSTART codon had been misidentified; the corrected start sites adhered more closely to the consensus motif (Kozak, 2000). Some authors pre-emptively defend their conclusions on the grounds that the (unidentified) cDNA sequences used for their analysis derive from RefSeq, which is a curated database (Pruitt et al., 2000). But the entries in RefSeq are not without errors, some of which \u2013 e.g. misidentified start codons, mistaken claims of upstream AUG codons \u2013 can be traced by comparing curated GenBank entries NM_005493, NM_005502, NM_000282 and NM_003605 with results published elsewhere (Campeau et al., 2001, Nishitani et al., 2001, Nolte and M\u00fcller, 2002, Santamarina-Fojo et al., 2000).",

Given that upstream AUG codons are used, as proved by detecting the encoded peptide or by fusing the upORF to a reporter gene, it is not anomalous to find a good context around some upstream AUG codons. All surveys tend to overestimate the incidence of upstream AUGs by scoring only the longest cDNA isoform, ignoring the existence of alternative transcripts that have shorter, unencumbered 5\u2032 UTRs (Section 4.2). The significance of upstream AUG codons also tends to be misstated: the presence of small upORFs in vertebrate mRNAs which\nare\nthereby\ntranslated\ninefficiently (see the foregoing discussion of TPO, oncogenes, etc.) constitutes evidence for, rather than against, the scanning model. The first-AUG rule, which I cite as evidence for the scanning mechanism, derives not from statistical analysis of cDNA sequences but from the experimentally observed fact (Section 2.2) that translation shifts predictably upstream or downstream when an AUG codon is added or removed. In short, it makes more sense to use the scanning/context rules to evaluate cDNA sequences (Hatzigeorgiou, 2002) than to attempt the reverse.",

            "text": "While conclusions about translation derived from experimental studies are arguably more meaningful than those derived from statistics, the interpretation of experimental results can be complicated. In vivo assays avoid the problem of reaction-conditions-dictating-the-outcome (see next paragraph), but there are other potential traps. The usually-valid assumption that polysomal association identifies actively translated mRNAs is called into question by the recent discovery of mRNAs trapped on large polysomes from which there is no polypeptide production (R\u00fcegsegger et al., 2001). The major problem when translation is studied in vivo is uncertainty about the structure of the mRNA. For example, a claim that IRES-mediated translation is developmentally regulated (Cr\u00e9ancier et al., 2000, Cr\u00e9ancier et al., 2001) is premature, inasmuch as those studies monitored the amount but not the form of mRNA. Other studies wherein translation of an encumbered leader sequence appears to improve under certain conditions or in certain cell types require better analyses to rule out a possible change in structure of the 5\u2032 UTR (Bernstein et al., 1995, Child et al., 1999b, Li et al., 2001, Zimmer et al., 1994). Some useful hints may be found in reports that describe the belated discovery of alternative forms of mRNA that were missed the first time around (Chen et al., 1999, Cortner and Farnham, 1990, D\u00e9jardin et al., 2000, Deng et al., 2002, Frost et al., 2000, Grundhoff and Ganem, 2001, Jordan et al., 1996, Kastner et al., 1990b, Kiss-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 et al., 1995, Laurin et al., 2000, Peremyslov and Dolja, 2002, Zhang and Liu, 2000, Zheng et al., 1994).",

The latter because insufficient attention is paid to reaction conditions that can affect the selection of AUG start codons. When the magnesium concentration is too low, the first AUG codon may be bypassed despite an adequate context; when the magnesium concentration is too high, initiation may occur at upstream non-AUG codons that are not naturally used. One solution is to include control transcripts for which start-codon selection was determined in vivo, and to adjust the in vitro reaction conditions to give the same result (Kozak, 1990b). Some suppliers of translation kits make it possible to adjust the magnesium concentration, but there is little awareness of the need to do so and the use of coupled transcription/translation systems makes it difficult.",

Extrapolating from what is seen when mRNAs are deliberately cleaved in vivo (Thoma et al., 2001), activation of internal start codons in vitro would depend on where the accidental cleavage occurs and whether the endolytic cleavage product persists long enough for a ribosome to engage the newly created 5\u2032 end before exonucleases take over. This line of reasoning could explain the claim that an \u2018artificial IRES\u2019, consisting of a multiple cloning region and a portion of the Escherichia\ncoli lacI gene, supports internal initiation of translation in starved yeast cells (Paz et al., 1999): starvation is likely to promote mRNA degradation, and the \u2018IRES\u2019 might fortuitously stabilize certain intermediates in degradation. The discovery that IRES elements are actually targeted by some ribonucleases (Elgadi and Smiley, 1999, Nadal et al., 2002) should be remembered.",

            "text": "The foregoing discussion of eIF4G translation alludes to only some of the problems associated with dicistronic vectors; a more detailed critique may be found elsewhere (Kozak, 2001a, Kozak, 2001b). Use of a certain popular vector which harbors an intron near the 5\u2032 end (Jopling and Willis, 2001) increases the likelihood of producing an unintended monocistronic mRNA via splicing; the candidate IRES need contribute only a cryptic 3\u2032 splice site. This indeed happens in some cases (Grundhoff and Ganem, 2001, Pinkstaff et al., 2001). Claims of IRES activity are problematic when supported by in vitro assays in which translation of the 3\u2032 ORF is very, very weak (e.g. Deffaud and Darlix, 2000, Lekven et al., 2001, Maser et al., 2001). The simple idea that an IRES can be identified based on the ability to support translation of a 3\u2032 cistron runs into trouble when, for example, the \u03b2-globin mRNA leader sequence, intended to serve as a negative control, turns out somehow to allow translation of a downstream cistron (Van der Velden et al., 2002). In another study, merely lengthening the intercistronic domain enabled substantial translation of the 3\u2032 cistron (Gallie et al., 2000), perhaps by providing room for RNases to cleave and thus release a translatable 3\u2032 fragment. Even with the paradigmatic IRES elements derived from picornaviruses, the ability to support internal initiation was found to depend inexplicably on the choice and arrangement of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 reporter genes (Hennecke et al., 2001). These oddities \u2013 along with the notable inability to translate the 3\u2032 cistron in natural dicistronic mRNAs (Table 1) \u2013 are reason to worry about the validity of experiments that employ synthetic dicistronic constructs.",

Scanning can occur over long distances, as evidenced by some bifunctional viral mRNAs in which the second start site is more than 500 nt downstream from the first (e.g. peanut clump virus, southern bean mosaic virus, rice tungro bacilliform virus; Table 3 and Fig. 1C). The structure-prone, GC-rich leader sequences on mammalian mRNAs strongly reduce translational efficiency but do not preclude operation of the scanning mechanism (Van der Velden et al., 2002). Upstream AUG codons also reduce translational efficiency and that\nis\nwhy\nthey\nare\nthere.

The discovery in archaea of proteins similar to certain eukaryotic initiation factors (Kyrpides and Woese, 1998) is intriguing for other reasons but has no direct bearing on whether the start codon in archaeal mRNAs might be recognized via a prokaryotic- or eukaryotic-type mechanism.

Credible experiments would require controls based on what we know about the consensus sequence: that the purine (A>G) in position \u22123 plays a dominant role, and the full effect requires that the GCCRCC motif abut the AUG codon (Kozak, 1999, Fig. 1).",

Major (thick arrow) and minor (thin arrow) translation products are identified below their respective start codons. Sequences that cause the initiation site to be weak, and thus promote leaky scanning, are highlighted in red. Offset rectangles represent ORFs in different reading frames. (A) With c-myc mRNA, a leaky scanning mechanism was inferred from experiments in which optimizing the context around the first AUG codon suppressed production of the 50 kDa isoform, while changing the upstream CUG codon to AUG suppressed production of both the 65 and 50 kDa isoforms (Spotts et al., 1997). Access to the downstream start site might be more complicated than here depicted, as there is a small out-of-frame ORF between the 65 and 50 kDa start sites. (B) With C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA, a mutation that strengthens the first start codon (UUCaugC\u2192ACCaugG) blocked production of all shorter isoforms, implicating a leaky scanning mechanism (Calkhoven et al., 2000). A small upORF (blue) superimposes another level of control, causing more ribosomes to bypass the start site for isoform B1 than would be expected from leaky scanning alone. Presumably because the AUGSTART codon for isoform B1 is positioned close to the termination site of the upORF, reinitiation at site B1 is inefficient and some ribosomes thus reach the far downstream start site for the 20 kDa isoform (LIP). As evidence for this reinitiation shunt, Calkhoven et al. (2000) showed that eliminating the AUG codon of the upORF abolished production of LIP and that strengthening or weakening the context around the upORF start codon caused corresponding changes in the yield of LIP. Although the smallest form of C/EBP\u03b2 can be generated in some situations by proteolysis (Dearth et al., 2001), the effects of the aforementioned mutations clearly implicate a translational mechanism. The LAP/LIP ratio shows tissue and stage specific variation (Dearth et al., 2001, Descombes and Schibler, 1991). (C) Whereas leaky scanning allows initiation at multiple sites within a single ORF in C/EBP\u03b2 and c-myc mRNAs, leaky scanning allows translation of three separate ORFs in the pregenomic mRNA of rice tungro bacilliform virus. These ORFs (not drawn to scale) have overlapping start and stop codons of the form AUGA. Translation via leaky scanning was inferred from the strong reduction (>13-fold) in translation of ORF2 and ORF3 when the start codon of ORF1 was changed from AUU to AUG (F\u00fctterer et al., 1997) and from the inhibitory effect on expression of ORF3 when an adventitious AUG codon was inserted into ORF2. The 5\u2032 leader sequence that precedes ORF1 has ten small upORFs which are not depicted here because that peculiar leader sequence, postulated to be translated by ribosome hopping (F\u00fctterer et al., 1996), is not required for the leaky scanning mechanism that underlies translation of ORFs 1, 2 and 3. (D) The avian reovirus S1 mRNA supports translation of one structural and two nonstructural proteins (Bodel\u00f3n et al., 2001). The depicted mechanism postulates that ORF1 has a dual function, encoding its own polypeptide (p10) and facilitating translation of ORF3 by shunting some ribosomes past the strong AUGSTART codon for ORF2. The absence of extraneous AUG codons in the 310 nt region between the end of ORF1 and the start of ORF3 is consistent with the idea that ORF3 might be translated by reinitiation. Some ribosomes would be expected to translate p17 (ORF2) by leaky scanning, engendered by the poor context at the start of ORF1. Improving the context at the start of ORF1 indeed increased production of p10 (Shmulevitz et al., 2002); unfortunately, the yield of p17, which would be expected to decrease, was not monitored. The observation that strengthening the context at the start of ORF1 had no effect on the yield of \u03c3C is not surprising because the reinitiation mechanism postulated to underlie translation of ORF3 would probably be limited by other features, such as the relatively large size of ORF1.",

            "text": "Fig. 2: Examples of minimally leaky scanning in which a strong, but not quite perfect, context at AUG#1 causes most ribosomes to initiate there while allowing a low level of initiation downstream. With the depicted viral mRNAs (A,B), the predominant product of translation is the capsid protein initiated from AUG#1. Low-level leaky scanning generates a small but adequate amount of the indicated second protein. With bovine coronavirus, a mutation in position +4 (U\u2192G, indicated in red) flanking AUG#1 strongly reduced translation from the downstream site (Senanayake and Brian, 1997), supporting the interpretation that the natural mRNA is slightly leaky because the context flanking AUG#1 is not a perfect match to the consensus sequence. With hepatitis B virus, ribosomes en route to the P start site (AUG#5) apparently bypass the weak AUG#2 by leaky scanning, while translation of the small ORF initiated at AUG#3 enables some ribosomes to miss the inhibitory AUG#4 (inhibitory because it resides in a strong context and overlaps the P ORF) and thus to reach AUG#5. Whereas the core protein start codon (AUG#1) here depicted resides in a context which allows a low level of leaky scanning, a slightly longer mRNA which encodes the pre-core protein has a stronger start codon (A in position \u22123) and polymerase cannot be translated from that form of mRNA (Fouillot and Rossignol, 1996). The publications on which the scheme shown here is based (Fouillot et al., 1993, Hwang and Su, 1998) also discuss some alternative possibilities vis-\u00e0-vis translation of polymerase. (C) The first AUG codon in rat histone H4 mRNA initiates translation of the full-length protein. The second AUG, 85 codons downstream and in the same reading frame, initiates production of a peptide which has growth-regulatory properties (Bab et al., 1999). (D) With rat A2AR adenosine receptor mRNA, an overlapping upORF that initiates at an AUG codon in a strong context is used to minimize production of A2AR protein. The overlapping arrangement precludes reinitiation but the not-quite-perfect context at the upstream start site allows low-level leaky scanning. This interpretation is supported by the observed ten-fold increase in translation of A2AR in vivo when the start codon of the upORF was eliminated (Lee et al., 1999). Via a second promoter, the rat A2A-R gene produces some transcripts with additional upORFs, but no transcript has yet been found that lacks the inhibitory upORF discussed here. Here and in Fig. 3, the major coding domain is shaded gray. Small regulatory ORFs (blue rectangles) are not drawn to scale.",

            "text": "Fig. 3: Small upstream ORFs in eukaryotic mRNAs function in various ways to modulate translation. Only the 5\u2032 end of each mRNA is depicted. (A) The presence of upORFs forces translation of the major ORF to occur by a reinitiation mechanism, which is usually inefficient. The extent of inhibition depends on the number and arrangement of upORFs and whether the context flanking the upstream start codon(s) allows some escape via leaky scanning. (B) Because reinitiation can occur only in the forward direction, an overlapping upORF strongly impairs translation of the major ORF. (C) Whereas type B mRNAs have a single in-frame start codon which is bypassed due to the overlapping upORF, type C mRNAs initiate from two in-frame start codons; the upORF serves to divert some ribosomes to the downstream start site. The depicted sequence is a simplified representation of GlyRS mRNA (Mudge et al., 1998). Translation of Bag-1 mRNA can also be fitted to this pattern: the first start site is an in-frame CUG codon which produces the 50 kDa form of Bag-1; the next start site (AUG#1, out-of-frame) initiates a small upORF within which the first in-frame AUG codon (AUG#2) resides, and that AUG is thereby skipped; the 36 kDa form of Bag-1 is produced from AUG#3 which is accessed by reinitiation following translation of the small upORF (Packham et al., 1997). Some other mRNAs that use an upORF to dodge one AUG codon in favor of another are described elsewhere (Mittag et al., 1997, Sarrazin et al., 2000). Note that the reinitiation shunt as here defined adheres to the linear scanning mechanism, unlike a shunt postulated to operate with cauliflower mosaic virus mRNA (Ryabova et al., 2000). (D) The common feature of mRNAs that use mechanism D is inhibition of translation in cis by a peptide encoded within the upORF. The amino acid sequence of the inhibitory peptide is different in each case (Morris and Geballe, 2000). In the column at the far right, asterisks indicate examples in which the translational control mechanism is regulated, e.g. via a change in concentration of eIF2 (GCN4) or arginine (CPA1) or polyamines (AdoMetDC) or, more commonly, via an alternative promoter that generates a simpler form of mRNA devoid of upORFs (c-mos, MDM2, IL-12; see text for other examples).",

Translational yields from various forms of TPO mRNA in transfected COS cells (far right column) are expressed relative to a control transcript that has a short, unencumbered 5\u2032 UTR. P1 and P2 are alternative promoters; a cluster of arrows indicates that P2 produces staggered start sites. The TPO coding domain (horizontal black bar) begins at an AUG codon which is labeled #8 because, in the longest form of mRNA (line 1), it is preceded by seven AUG codons that initiate small upORFs. Superscript letters indicate whether each upstream AUG resides in a strong (S) or weak (W) context and horizontal blue lines depict the approximate length and arrangement of the upORFs. Vertical lines demarcate the boundaries of exons; carets depict the introns in alternatively spliced transcripts. Only the beginning of the TPO coding domain (exons 3\u20137) is shown. The key point is that the normal set of transcripts supports translation poorly because upORF7 overlaps the TPO start site. Various mutations (shown in red) that relieve this constraint elevate the translation of TPO, and this overproduction causes hereditary thrombocythemia. Among the normal set of mRNAs, the \u2018rare\u2019 transcript from promoter P1 (line 2) supports translation slightly better than the others, perhaps because the short distance between upORF2 and AUG#7 enables some reinitiating ribosomes to bypass AUG#7 and thus reach AUG#8. Because of the strong context at AUGs #1 and #2, upORFs 1 and 2 would be more effective than upORFs 5 and 6 in setting up this reinitiation shunt. The depicted scheme is based on experiments described by Ghilardi et al. (1998) and Wiestner et al. (1998).
