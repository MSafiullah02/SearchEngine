Despite these advances, modern treatment options for FIP remain palliative and vaccines have proven either unsafe or ineffective (Pedersen, 2014b). The emergence of SARS-associated coronavirus has provided an impetus for an investment in antiviral discovery focused on coronaviruses (De Clercq, 2004). A 3C-like protease inhibitor (GC376) was first demonstrated to be highly effective against experimental FIPV infections (Kim et al., 2016). A subsequent study on cats with naturally acquired FIP showed them to be much more difficult to treat (Pedersen et al., 2017). Nevertheless, this was the first study demonstrating the potential for an antiviral compound to treat FIP in nature and 6 of 20 cats have remained disease free for well over one year after 12 weeks of treatment (Pedersen et al., 2017).",

The active NTP analog functions as a competitor of the natural nucleoside triphosphates in viral RNA synthesis. The active form of GS-441524 has been shown to inhibit RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediated transcription by incorporating into the nascent viral transcript and causing premature termination (Sheahan et al., 2017).

This was tested in an experimental infection study where laboratory cats were inoculated intraperitoneally with a strain of FIPV that has been maintained as near to wild-type as possible and well characterized in past studies (Kim et al., 2016; Pedersen et al., 2015). Twelve adolescent laboratory cats were challenge-exposed to this FIPV and their response to GS-441524 treatment monitored when terminal disease signs became apparent. Ten of 12 of these cats, 16\u2013113, 16-116, 16-119, 16-123 and 124, 16-127 to 131, demonstrated clinical signs consistent with FIP within 10-18 days, while two cats (16-115 and 16-118) remained healthy (Fig. 3\n). Clinical signs of FIP in the affected cats started with hyperthermia (>103 F) (Fig. 4\n) and lymphopenia (less than or equal to 1700 cells/ul blood) (Fig. 5\n), and then rapidly progressed to depression, anorexia, hyperbilirubinemia, and ascites. The severity of lymphopenia appeared to be proportional to the severity of overall disease signs and one cat (16\u2013113) had a measured nadir of 143 lymphocytes/ul blood (Fig. 5). Rectal temperature and lymphocyte levels remained normal in the two asymptomatic cats.",

The initial step involved screening potential compounds and identifying ones with favorable EC50 and CC50 values. This was done in vitro using CRFK cells and a tissue culture adapted serotype II FIPV (FIPV-WSU-79-1146). CRFK infection experiments identified GS-441524, which had a low EC50 (0.78 uM) against FIPV-79-1146 and no cytotoxicity at the highest concentrations tested (100 uM). The next step involved an ex vivo experiment using naturally infected peritoneal macrophage cultures established from two field cases of effusive FIP. GS-441524 was equally effective in inhibiting wild-type serotype I FIPV replication in naturally infected peritoneal cells than it was in inhibiting FIPV-79-1146 in CRFK cells. Therefore, we anticipated that GS-441524 would also be effective in cat infection studies against the virulent non-tissue culture adapted serotype 1 FIPV-m3c-2 strain.",

No acute toxicities were observed in laboratory cats after a single SC or IV injection of GS-441524. Subcutaneous or intravenous dosage at 5 mg/kg GS-441524 resulted in similar plasma profiles and the intracellular triphosphate levels were approximately 8\u201320 uM in feline PBMCs over a 24 h period. The occurrence of neurological and ocular disease in cats FIP (Pedersen 2014b), and CNS complications in an earlier trial of a viral protease inhibitor (Pedersen et al., 2017), was impetus for a supplementary PK experiment testing the ability of GS-441524 to pass the blood/eye and blood/brain barriers. A single SC dose of GS-441524 at 10 mg/kg resulted in intraocular and CNS drug levels of the parent GS-441524 that were near or above the effective 1 uM level. Whether this amount of GS-441524 entering eyes and brain can cure disease in these sites must await field testing, as it is extremely difficult to recreate and study ocular and neurologic diseases in the laboratory. GC376, a 3 C-like protease inhibitor, crossed the blood-to-brain barrier at a CSF/plasma ratio comparative to GS-441524 (Kim et al., 2015), but it was not effective against pre-existing neurological disease or in preventing eventual CNS involvement in a proportion of treated cats (Pedersen et al., 2017).",

A dosage of 5 mg/kg of the parent drug sustained blood levels over 24 h in the PK study, which was 8\u201320 times higher than an EC50 of the calculated from cell culture experiments.
