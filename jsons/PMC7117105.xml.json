It is an enveloped single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that encodes a single envelope-associated matrix protein (M), two glycoproteins (hemagglutinin H and fusion protein F), two RNA-polymerase-associated proteins (phosphoprotein P and large protein L), and a nucleocapsid protein (N) that encapsulates the viral RNA (Sato et al., 2012). This group of virus causes significantly serious disease in their respective hosts: measles virus in human, rinderpest virus in cattle, phocine distemper virus in seals, peste des petits ruminant virus in sheep and goats and canine distemper virus (CDV) in several species of carnivores (Rima and Duprex, 2006). Each morbillivirus infects a specific animal species due to the preferential use of species-specific signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) as the receptor (Tatsuo et al., 2001). Until 2012, no morbillivirus-associated disease has been identified in domestic cats.",

In view of this phenomenon, a molecular epidemiology study was conducted, leading to the discovery and isolation of a proposed novel feline paramyxovirus in domestic cats in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2012). It was then followed by the discovery of the feline paramyxovirus from other countries including Japan, Italy, Germany, USA, Turkey, Brazil and our Southeast Asian counterpart, Thailand (Darold et al., 2017; Furuya et al., 2014; Lorusso et al., 2015; Sharp et al., 2016; Sieg et al., 2015; Yilmaz et al., 2017). The virus, named as feline morbillivirus (FeMV; initially abbreviated as FMoPV), has been identified having fewer than 80% nucleotide similarities to other known paramyxoviruses (Furuya et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2012). Phylogenetic analysis on six genes (N, P, M, F, H and L genes) in the first study of FeMV showed that all Hong Kong isolates were clustered together, forming a unique and distant cluster from the other morbilliviruses (Woo et al., 2012). Based on Park et al. (2014), there is no geographical relationship based on the FeMV phylogeny. Although phylogenetic analyses of identified FeMV in USA reported a global distribution of FeMV, the USA strain was closely related to Asian FeMV (Sharp et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Histological examinations and case-control studies linked the presence of FeMV with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) in FeMV-positive cats (Woo et al., 2012). There were also higher FeMV-positive samples detected in kidney tissues compared to other type of samples, suggesting that the virus was nephrotropic (Furuya et al., 2014). Interestingly, a new feline paramyxovirus that shares 72\u201374% nucleotide homology to the bat and rodent paramyxovirus has been discovered (Sieg et al., 2015). A putative recombinant isolate of Japanese FeMV has been identified, involving the recombination of F and H genes between two virus isolates from Hong Kong and Japan (Park et al., 2014). A more recent study on molecular characterisation of FeMV suggested that the virus is to be divided into two genotypes based on the sequence homology with other known FeMVs (Sieg et al., 2018). Furthermore, the new genotype, FeMV-GT2 has been shown to infect lung epithelial, brain and immune cells other than the kidney epithelial cells (Sieg et al., 2019). As this novel virus may be more diverse in its pathogenicity than their counterpart, CDV, the presence of FeMV needs to be investigated and characterised. Further characterisation of FeMV isolated in Malaysia may potentially identify the origin of the virus, thus a better understanding on the evolution of FeMV. This study is a preliminary investigation of the existence of feline morbillivirus in Malaysia. The detection and molecular characterisation of this virus in domestic cats in Malaysia are important in order to examine the existence and impact of this virus to the feline population.",

The client-owned/pet cats were either presented to the veterinary clinics for annual health examination, neutering or health issues associated with kidney-related problem. The owner\u2019s consent was obtained prior to sample collection. Shelter cats were recruited as part of studies that investigated the prevalence of several other feline viruses. Therefore, not all type of samples (blood, urine or kidney) were collected from each cat. Either blood (n = 61), urine (n = 90) or kidney (n = 22) was obtained from 173 cats; both blood and urine samples were obtained from 32 cats; both blood and kidney samples were collected from one cat; and all three samples were collected from two cats. Kidney tissues collected through post-mortem examination were either from pet or shelter cats that died naturally or euthanised due to kidney-unrelated problems. Data such as the cat\u2019s age, sex and clinical findings were obtained for the pet cats; however, limited information could be obtained from shelter cats.",

The differences in the prevalence could be attributed to several factors, such as the variation of geographical location and the exposure to outdoor environment in both pet and shelter cats. Furthermore, as the pathogenesis of FeMV is currently unclear, we could only suggest that the FeMV might have long incubation period in which the chronic shedding of the virus may facilitate transmission between cats especially for those that live in a multi-cat environment.",

The detection rate of FeMV was also found to be higher in the kidney (80.0%) than urine (50.8%). The result of our study was consistent with the report from Japan where the detection of FeMV was higher in kidney tissues compared to urine (Furuya et al., 2014). Various pathological changes such as interstitial cell infiltration, glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy and fibrosis have been significantly correlated with the presence of FeMV antigen (Sutummaporn et al., 2019). Furthermore, of the 45 cats that had more than one type of samples collected, only one cat was positive for both urine and kidney samples. Since this cat originated from a shelter, there was no further information that could be correlated with the findings. We could only speculate that the shedding of the virus could be due to the stage of FeMV infection when it tries to evade the host immune responses, representing a host-pathogen interaction (Ou et al., 2017).",

In this study, there was no association (p = 0.083) between FeMV-positive cats with the presence of kidney/urinary-related disease as observed in other studies (McCallum et al., 2018; Park et al., 2016). This classification of kidney-diseased cats was made possible by the availability of serum urea and creatinine level and previous history of kidney-associated problems. Due to the limitation of the study, we did not obtain additional parameters that would enable us to stage the CKD in our sampled cats. To date, this novel virus cannot be conclusively associated with kidney disease as there are contrasting studies that found indirect association between these two variables (Woo et al., 2012; Furuya et al., 2014; Sieg et al., 2015). Therefore, prospectively studying a large number of cats with CKD together with the observation of pathological damage in the renal tissues and presence of viral RNA and acute/convalescent sera would be beneficial to establish the pathogenicity of FeMV. Several studies have also looked into other risk factors associated with feline morbillivirus infection such as age and gender (Park et al., 2016; Sieg et al., 2015). In this study, a similar number of male to female (100:108) cats was recruited. There was an association between gender and FeMV infection (P = 0.031), implying that male has higher chance of getting FeMV infection compared to female cats. This could be due to the territorial fighting, aggressiveness and marking behaviour of male cats, increasing the risk of transmission between male cats as observed in other diseases (Goldkamp et al., 2008; Yamamoto et al., 1989).",

It was suspected that sample degradation might have occurred during the storing period or the low viral load that was below the detection limit of the N gene conventional RT-PCR assay.",

These results suggested that the FeMV isolates in this study were circulating within the Asian region. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis suggested that all Malaysian FeMVs were divergent from the FeMVs isolated in USA, Italy, Brazil and Turkey as different lineages were observed. A whole genome sequence analysis would be beneficial to assess any recombination events that may have occurred as observed in other study (Park et al., 2014). Furthermore, the availability of the sequences of novel viruses in public domain serves as a useful database for the rapid identification of emerging new diseases, such as in the case of MERS-CoV (Sridhar et al., 2015).",
