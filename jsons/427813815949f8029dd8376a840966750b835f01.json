Decellularization of existing tissues have formed the basis of one major approach to producing 3D scaffolds for such purposes. In this study, we utilize the native hypanthium tissue of apples and a simple preparation methodology to create implantable cellulose scaffolds. To examine biocompatibility, scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in wild-type, immunocompetent mice (males and females; 6-9 weeks old). Following the implantation, the scaffolds were resected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks and processed for histological analysis (H&E, Masson's Trichrome, anti-CD31 and anti-CD45 antibodies). Histological analysis revealed a characteristic foreign body response to the scaffold 1 week post-implantation. However, the immune response was observed to gradually disappear by 8 weeks post-implantation. By 8 weeks, there was no immune response in the surrounding dermis tissue and active fibroblast migration within the cellulose scaffold was observed. This was concomitant with the deposition of a new collagen extracellular matrix. Furthermore, active blood vessel formation within the scaffold was observed throughout the period of study indicating the pro-angiogenic properties of the native scaffolds. Finally, while the scaffolds retain much of their original shape they do undergo a slow deformation over the 8-week length of the study.",

Such polymer or hydrogel formulations can be moulded or 3D-printed to produce forms that are of therapeutic values [37] [38] [39] . An alternative approach to these synthetic strategies is whole organ decellularization [10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Indeed, it has been shown that it is possible to dissociate the cells from a donated organ, leaving behind the naturally occurring scaffold matrix, commonly referred as a ghost organs [14] . The ghost organs lack any of the cells from the donor and can be subsequently cultured with cells derived from the patient or another source. Such approaches have already been utilized to repair and replace defective tissues [40] [41] [42] . In the past several years, many body parts have been created using synthetic and decellularization approaches, including the urethra, vaginal, ear, nose, heart, kidney, bladder, and neurological tissues [14, 38, 39, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .",

            "text": "However, these approaches are not without some disadvantages [48] . Synthetic techniques can require animal products and decellularization strategies still require donor tissues and organs. There has also been intense investigation into the development of resorbable biomaterials [49] . In these cases, the aim is to provide the body with a temporary 3D scaffold onto which healthy tissues can form. After several week or months, the implanted scaffold will be resorbed leaving behind a completely natural healthy tissue [26, 29, 50, 51] . Although this is an ideal approach, many non-resorbable biomaterials (ceramic, titanium) have been successfully employed in clinical settings and play a major role in numerous therapies [2, 49, [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . Importantly, resorbable biomaterials suffer from the fact that regenerated tissues often collapse and become deformed due to the loss of structure [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . For example, for several decades, research on ear reconstruction from engineered cartilage has shown that biomaterial implants eventually collapse and become deformed as the implanted scaffolds break down and resorb [63] . However, recent successful approaches have relied on the use of resorbable collagen scaffolds embedded with permanent titanium wire supports [53, 64, 65] . Therefore, the need for non-resorbable, yet biocompatible, scaffolds persists in the field of tissue and organ engineering.",

            "text": "Recent complementary approaches have utilized scaffolding materials that are not derived from human organ donors or animal products. Namely, various forms of cellulose have been shown to have utility in both in vitro and in vivo studies [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . Cellulose is abundant in nature, is easily produced and sourced, can be chemically modified to control surface biochemistry and produced as hydrogels with tuneable porosity and mechanical properties [67, [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . Moreover, nanocrystalline, nanofibrillar and bacterial cellulose constructs and hydrogels also have been shown to support the proliferation and invasion of mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo with high biocompatibility [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . In our recent work, we developed an orthogonal, yet complementary, approach to organ decellularization and synthetic cellulose strategies. We developed a highly robust and cost effective strategy for producing cellulose biomaterials from decellularized apple hypanthium tissue [27] . The scaffolds required no further complex processing as is often the case in the production of nanocrystalline, nanofibrillar and bacterial cellulose constructs. The cellulose scaffolds were employed for in vitro 3D culture of NIH3T3 fibroblasts, mouse C2C12 muscle myoblasts and human HeLa epithelial cells. Our previous work revealed that these cells could adhere, invade and proliferate within the cellulose scaffolds and retain high viability even after 12 continuous weeks of culture.",

Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize the response of the body to apple-derived cellulose scaffolds. Macroscopic (~25 mm 3 ) cell-free cellulose biomaterials were produced and subcutaneously implanted in mouse model for 1, 4 and 8 weeks. Here, we assess the immunological response of immunocompetent mice, deposition of extracellular matrix on the scaffolds and evidence of angiogenesis (vascularization) in the implanted cellulose biomaterials. Notably, although a foreign body response was observed immediately post-implantation, as expected for a surgical procedure, by the completion of the study only a low immunological response was observed with no fatalities or noticeable infections whatsoever in all animal groups. Surrounding cells were also found to invade the scaffold, mainly activated fibroblasts, and deposit a new extracellular matrix. As well, the scaffold itself was able to retain much of its original shape and structure over the 8-week study. Importantly, the scaffolds clearly had a pro-angiogenic effect, resulting in the growth of functional blood vessels throughout the implanted biomaterial. Taken together, our work demonstrates that we can easily produce 3D cellulose scaffolds that are biocompatible, becoming vascularized and integrated into surrounding healthy tissues.",

In order to prepare apple sections, the fruit was cut with a mandolin slicer to a uniform thickness of 1.14\u00b10.08mm, measured with a Vernier caliper. Only the outer (hypanthium) tissue of the apple was used. Slices containing visible ovary-core tissue were not used.

Apple tissue was then decellularized by using a wellestablished protocol [14] for removing cellular material and DNA from tissue samples while leaving behind an intact and three-dimensional scaffold. Individual apple tissue samples were placed in sterilized 2.5ml microcentrifuge tubes and 2ml of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS; Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added to each tube. Samples were shaken for 48 hours at 180 RPM at room temperature. The resultant cellulose scaffolds were then transferred into new sterile microcentrifuge tubes, washed and incubated for 12 hours in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich). To sterilize the cellulose scaffold, they were incubated in 70% ethanol for 1 hour and then washed 12 times with PBS. The samples were then maintained in PBS with 1% streptomycin/penicillin (HyClone) and 1% amphotericin B (Wisent, QC, Canada). At this point, the samples were immediately used or stored at 4\u00b0C for no more than 2 weeks.",

At the 4 week point we observed a stark difference in both the surrounding epidermis tissue and in the cell population migrating into the cellulose scaffold (Fig 3E) . The epidermis tissue surrounding the cellulose scaffold has a decreased immune response, now scored as mild to low. The population of cells within the epidermis surrounding scaffolds now contain higher levels of macrophages and lymphocytes (Fig 3E) . This is an anticipated characteristic of the foreign body reaction to an implanted biomaterial, demonstrating the scaffold cleaning process [84] [85] [86] . There is also an increase in the population of multinucleated cells within the interior of the scaffold as part of an inflammatory response (Fig 3E) . Finally, 8 weeks post-implantation, the immune response apparent at 1 and 4 weeks has completely disappeared (Fig 3F) , with the epidermis tissue now appearing normal. In fact, the epidermis tissue in contact with the cellulose scaffold contains the same structures as normal epidermis tissue. In the cellulose scaffold perimeter there is now a lower density of cells due to the decreased inflammation and notably, there are no fragmented dead cells present. Instead, the population of cells now contain an elevated level of macrophages, multinucleated cells and active fibroblasts. The active fibroblasts (appearing spindle shaped), can be observed migrating from the surrounding epidermis into the cellulose scaffold. In fact, fibroblasts were found throughout the cellulose scaffold. These results demonstrate that by 8 weeks post-implantation the cellulose scaffold has been accepted by the host. In parallel with the H&E inflammation analysis, we performed anti-CD45 staining to evaluate the level of inflammation throughout the scaffold and surrounding dermis tissue (Fig 3 G-I) . It is clear that the inflammation throughout the dermis and within the scaffold is elevated after 1 week. However, the amount of leukocytes significantly decreases in the surrounding dermis and scaffold over the implantation time reaching a near basal level at 8 weeks.",

As fibroblast cells invade the scaffold, as seen with H&E staining and confirmed by antialpha smooth muscle actin staining (data not shown), collagen deposits inside the cellulose scaffold can be observed after 4 weeks (Fig 4B, E, and H) . At 8 weeks (Fig   4C, F and I) the collagen network is clearly visible inside the cavities of the cellulose scaffold.

Our data reveals that the implanted scaffolds demonstrate a low inflammatory response, promote cell invasion and extracellular matrix deposition, and act as a pro-angiogenic environment. Remarkably, none of the mice in this study died or demonstrated any symptoms of implant rejection such as edema, exudates or discomfort during the course of this research indicative of a successful implantation of the cellulose scaffolds. This implanted scaffolds are composed of a porous network of cavities in which the original host plant cells resided [69] . This architecture efficiently facilitates transfer of nutrients throughout the plant tissue. As we have shown here and in our previous study, the apple tissues are easily decellularized [27] . This simple treatment changes the appearance of the hypanthium tissue so that it becomes transparent, as a result of the removal of cellular materials.",

Consistent with the immune response within the cellulose scaffold, the surrounding tissue is observed to return to its original physiology. In fact, at 8 week implantation the surrounding tissue is nearly similar to control tissue. Although the immune response and inflammation at 8 weeks is low, low levels of macrophages can be observed within the scaffold. Although traditionally associated with inflammation, macrophages have beneficial roles consistent with our findings. Specifcially, macrophages are also known to secrete growth and pro-angiogenic factors, ECM proteins and pro-fibrogenic factors that actively regulate the fibro-proliferation and angiogenesis in tissue repair and regeneration [86] . Regardless, the vast population of cells within the scaffold after 8 weeks are now reactive fibroblasts. These cells are altering the microenvironment of the scaffold through the secretion of a new collagen extracellular matrix. Importantly the new matrix displays a remarkably low density compared, suggestive of regeneration as opposed to the characteristic high density, cable-like organization of collagen found in scar tissues [89] .",

As with native tissue, limited blood supply to the scaffold will result in ischemia and potentially necrosis. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that bioceramics with pore diameters lower than 400\u03bcm resulted in a decrease in the growth of blood vessels and limits the size of blood vessel diameter in in vivo implantations. The porous structure of the cell wall architecture is composed of overlapping cell wall cavities with diameters ranging from 100-300\u03bcm with manual interconnection distance of 4.04\u00b11.4\u03bcm. As such, the high porosity size and low volumefraction of the cellulose scaffolds are consistent with the promotion of blood vessel formation. Taken together, the cellulose scaffold now appears to completely void of the provisional matrix and fully accepted as a subcutaneous implant.",

Rather, the change in area is due to the collapse of the cell wall cavities on the perimeter of the scaffold resulting from the active movement of the mouse. Active biological degradation is not expected to be possible as mammals lack the appropriate enzymes to digest plant-synthesized cellulose [91, 92] . Moreover, the highly crystalline form of cellulose that is found in plant tissues is also known to resistant to degradation in mammals [92] . Alternatively, it has been demonstrated that in vivo cellulose implants can be chemically activated in order to be more easily degraded [93] . Most importantly however, highly crystalline forms of cellulose have some of the lowest reported immunological responses [92] .",

Moreover, the products of degradation can also be found to have toxic or undesirable side-effects [53, 110, 111] . For example, the reconstruction of the ear has become a well-known challenge in tissue engineering. Early studies have employed scaffolds in the shape of an ear that are produced from animal or human derived cartilage [53, 58, 59, 61, 63, 64] . However, after implantation and eventual scaffold degradation, the ear is often found to collapse or deform [60] [61] [62] . Recent strategies have now opted to create biological composite materials composed of both a titanium frame embedded in a biological matrix [53] . Therefore, there is still a clear need for non-resorbable, yet inert and biocompatible, scaffolds persists in the field of tissue and organ engineering.",

This approach is complementary to bacterial cellulose strategies which have demonstrated clear utility as well [66, [69] [70] [71] 73, 80, 83, 102, 106, [112] [113] [114] [115] . However, plant derived materials are cost effective to produce and are extremely straightforward to prepare for implantation, exhibit clear biocompatibility, an ability to retain their shape while supporting the production of natural extracellular matrix and most importantly, the promotion of vascularization. In our previous work we have shown that the scaffolds can also be functionalized with proteins prior to culture in vitro. Such work will also be conducted in the future in order to explore the use of scaffold surface functionalization with growth factors and matrix proteins to promote the invasion of specific cell types, further minimize the early immune response and promote maximal vascularization. Moreover, the cellulose scaffolds can easily be formed into specific shapes and sizes, offering an opportunity to create new tissues with specific geometrical properties. Although there are numerous new avenues of research to follow, we have been able to demonstrate that acellular cellulose scaffolds are biocompatible in vivo in immunocompetent mice and might be considered as a new strategy for tissue regeneration.",

At 4 weeks, a decreased immune response can be observed (mild to low immune response) and the population of cells within the epidermis surrounding scaffolds now contain higher levels of monocytes and lymphocytes characterizing chronic response (E). Finally, at 8 weeks, the immune response has completely resorbed with the epidermis tissue now appearing normal. The immune response observed with H&E staining is confirmed using anti-CD45 antibody, a well known markers of leukocytes (G-I).
