Here we describe detailed methods for establishing monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). B cell hybridomas are generated from mice that are hyperimmunized with inactivated SARS-CoV virions. The hybridomas produce monoclonal antibodies that recognize viral component molecules, including the spike protein (S) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), enabling the immunological detection of SARS-CoV by immunofluorescence staining, immunoblot, or an antigen-capture ELISA system. In addition, several S protein-specific antibodies are shown to have in vitro neutralization activity. Thus the monoclonal antibody approach provides useful tools for rapid and specific diagnosis of SARS, as well as for possible antibody-based treatment of the disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 ultimately led to 8000 people becoming infected, 916 of whom died. The causative agent was identified as SARS coronavirus (SARS- CoV) (1,2) . Even though the epidemic ended, the threat of reemergence persists, compounded by the absence of an established vaccine. One of the critical issues in controlling a pandemic is a system for early diagnosis that distinguishes SARS from other Ohnishi types of pulmonary infections. Based on clinical experience, several options have been considered in the quest to develop the capacity to accurately diagnose SARS-CoV infection, including molecular biology techniques and serological tests such as antigen-capture ELISA assay and immunofluorescence assay to detect virus-infected cells in respiratory swabs (3-7) . The preparation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is considered to be especially valuable for serological testing. Here we describe a method for the successful establishment and characterization of mAbs against SARS-CoV structural components. These mAbs enable the general immunological detection of SARS-CoV by methods such as immunofluorescent staining, immunoblotting, and immunohistology, in addition to the construction of a highly sensitive antigen-capture sandwich ELISA (6).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 204, "text": "CoV) (1,2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 794, "end": 817, "text": "respiratory swabs (3-7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "1.

The SARS-CoV also raises a high titer of serum antibody in mice. However, the immunization protocol should be optimized to obtain the desired specificity and quality of mAbs of interest. The choice of parameters for immunization, such as the type of adjuvant, pretreatment of viral antigens (inactivation procedures), antigen dose, route of immunization, and the strain of mice, profoundly affect the properties of resulting mAbs. For example, we found that inactivation of SARS-CoV with UV or formaldehyde gave rise to different immunoglobulin isotypes in mice (8). In addition, the choice of host animals for the immunization affects the mode of epitope recognition. With the common fusion-partner cell lines such as NS-1, P3U1, or Sp2/O, a variety of mouse strains, even different species such as rat and hamsters, are usable for the donor of antigen-specific B cells. However, BALB/c mice are the most commonly used immunization host because the most efficient fusion-partner myelomas are derived from BALB/c strain. The protocol described here is a general procedure to obtain mAbs against viral antigens, though the choice of parameters, i.e., the immunization protocol, hybridoma production and so on, should be optimized for each purpose (see Note 1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "1.

For further understanding and detailed explanations of the hybridoma methodology, good textbooks are available (10,11). 2. The validation for the complete inactivation of the virus is crucial. For a detailed account see Chapter 11 in this volume. 3. In this step the culture supernatants are diluted to one-half in order to reduce the background of the ELISA. If the background is still high, dilution of the culture supernatants can be one-fifth to one-tenth or more with PBS-Tween. 4. The titration of the mAbs and the second reagent is very important for obtaining the best results. It often varies from 1/100 to 1/100,000, and it should be determined for each mAb. 5. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is carried out by the method of Laemmli (12). The detailed conditions, such as the concentration of the gel or reducing/nonreducing and so on, should be changed case by case. Generally, loading 0.5-10 g/lane of purified virus fraction would be enough for the detection of the viral antigen by the chemiluminescence method. 6. We conveniently utilize transparent sheets such as those used for an overhead projector (OHP-sheet). 7. In order to obtain good sensitivity and specificity of the test system, the optimization of the combination of two antibodies, i.e., coating mAb and detecting mAb, is required. This can be done by the ELISA with a matrix of candidate coating-mAbs and detecting-mAbs (6).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Notes"}]}
