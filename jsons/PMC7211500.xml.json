            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 3 million patients with more than 200 000 deaths in more than 230 countries.1 COVID-19 spreads quickly from person to person,2 and is primarily an acute viral pneumonia leading to respiratory failure as reported in autopsy studies and animal models,3, 4 although cytokine storm and extrapulmonary involvements have been occasionally reported.3, 4 Besides respiratory and intensive care support to the extent of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, no specific antiviral treatment has been recommended because of insufficient evidence from randomised trials. Many repurposed drugs have been shown to have in-vitro activity against the close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, which are all beta-coronaviruses. Lopinavir and many interferons, particularly interferon beta, have been shown to have modest activity in vitro against SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and can be used synergistically with ribavirin.5, 6 In 2003, we did an open-label trial using historical controls, and showed that a combination of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir with ribavirin reduced the mortality and need for intensive respiratory support of patients with SARS who had been admitted to hospital.7 Moreover, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir or interferon beta-1b has been shown to reduce viral load and improve lung pathology in a common marmoset model.8 However the viral load of SARS and MERS peaks at around day 7\u201310 after symptom onset, whereas the viral load of COVID-19 peaks at the time of presentation, similar to influenza.9, 10 Experience from the treatment of patients with influenza who are admitted to hospital suggested that a combination of multiple antiviral drugs is more effective than single drug treatments in this setting of patients with a high viral load at presentation.11, 12 Therefore, we did this phase 2 randomised trial to establish whether a combination of three modestly active drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can improve the viral load profile and clinical parameters in adults with COVID-19 requiring hospital admission.",

Our search did not show any randomised controlled trials assessing a combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nAdded value of this study\nThis is the first randomised controlled trial on the triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and ribavirin, compared with single-drug lopinavir\u2013ritonavir in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Treatment with the triple combination effectively suppressed viral load in all clinical specimens, including the nasopharyngeal swab, throat saliva, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and stool in most patients 8 days from treatment commencement, which was significantly shorter than the time taken in the control group, treated with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir alone. The triple combination also alleviated symptoms completely within 4 days\u2014a significantly shorter time than the control. The triple combination also suppressed IL-6 levels. The clinical and virological efficacy resulted in shorter hospital stays and facilitated infection control. This treatment regimen was also shown to be safe, with minor and self-limiting gastrointestinal adverse events of diarrhoea and vomiting. Increased liver enzymes were uncommon, and resolved upon stopping the medications.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThis study showed that early treatment with the triple combination of antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and ribavirin is safe and highly effective in shortening the duration of virus shedding, decreasing cytokine responses, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating the discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the triple antiviral therapy rapidly rendered viral load negative in all specimens, thereby reducing infectiousness of the patient.\n",

For those recruited and treated between days 7 and 14, interferon beta-1b injection was omitted to avoid its proinflammatory effects. Patients assigned to the control group received only oral lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg) every 12 h for 14 days. For patients who had no history of prolonged QTc syndrome, but were found to have prolonged QTc less than 480 ms, first-degree heart block or bundle branch block, or bradycardia upon ECG examination, and those who developed increased alanine transaminase of three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment was reduced to once per day. Lopinavir\u2013ritonavir would be stopped if alanine transaminase levels exceeded six times the ULN. The randomisation window from symptom onset was extended from 10 to 14 days after trial commencement after knowing that the incubation period could go beyond 14 days. Because a placebo group was generally not accepted in Chinese culture, and our previous study showed that interferon beta-1b and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir are active against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir was used in the control group whereas interferon beta-1b, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and ribavirin were used in the combination group for patients admitted less than 7 days from symptom onset.",

Therefore, drug repurposing by testing existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that have been used to treat other viral infections is the most feasible approach in a pandemic. Many drugs have been shown to have some in-vitro activity against betacoronaviruses, including remdesivir, favipiravir, nitazoxanide, camostat mesilate, interferons, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and convalescent plasma containing neutralising antibodies.5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 These drugs have known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, side-effects, and dosing regimens. As expected, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir alone was shown to have similar effects to placebo on reducing viral load when treatment was initiated at a median of 13 days after symptom onset, despite some improvement in symptoms.22 Up to now, only two open-label non-randomised trials have been reported. One trial used a combination of oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 20 patients with COVID-19 showing that this combination might reduce viral load significantly by day 6 after treatment, compared with 16 controls from another hospital, which could be due to chance because this combination was not planned a priori and the addition of azithromycin was at the physician's discretion.23 A small retrospective analysis showed that viral load was negative at day 7 post-treatment in 75% of patients with COVID-19 treated with arbidol and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (16 patients) versus 35% of patients treated with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir alone (17 patients).24\n",

The viral load profile of COVID-19 is similar to that of influenza, which has a high viral load at the time of initiation of anti-influenza treatment. The emergence of resistant influenza virus quasispecies during treatment has been well reported with single-drug treatment by amantadine, baloxavir marboxil, and oseltamivir in the setting of severe influenza or diseases caused by H5N1, H7N9, or in immunosuppressed hosts.11, 17, 25 Thus, the antiviral combination was considered a reasonable option to improve the outcome of severe influenza. Indeed, we have previously shown that a combination of naproxen and clarithromycin, with weak anti-influenza virus activity in vitro individually, when combined with oseltamivir can improve the morbidity and mortality and shorten the duration of hospital stay in patients with influenza A/H3N2 pneumonia.12 Furthermore, we have previously shown that a combination of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and ribavirin significantly reduced mortality and respiratory failure in patients during the 2003 SARS outbreak.7 Thus, we hypothesised that a triple combination of modest antiviral drugs might rapidly suppress the high initial viral load, improve the clinical parameters, and reduce risk of health-care workers by reducing the duration and quantity of virus shedding from these treated patients.",

Notably, the maintenance of high serum interferon beta-1b level is not essential once the antiviral status of exposed cells is induced. The EC50 of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 was 109 \u03bcM,15 which greatly exceeds the drug's serum concentration with the usual oral dosing. Nevertheless, synergistic activity between interferons and a lower dose of ribavirin have been shown in checkerboard assays. However, combining ribavirin with interferons (alfa-2a, alfa-2b, and beta-1a) did not improve outcomes in critically ill patients with MERS.28 Thus, the repurposing of this triple combination of modestly active lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, interferon beta-1b, and ribavirin for the treatment of this novel pandemic virus should be a reasonable therapeutic approach.",
