The first occurred almost a million years ago, when our hominid precursors discovered how to use fire to cook the meat they had hunted. They found that cooked meat tasted better, it didn't go bad so quickly, and eating it was less likely to make them ill. Our understanding of nutrition, a basic tenet of public health science, and the art of cooking have been improving ever since.",

Our forebears, perhaps our women ancestors, learned how to domesticate animals for food, milk and clothing. About the same time, they discovered that seed grain could be planted, harvested, and stored from one season to the next, and then used to make flour and thence bread and similar high-density carbohydrate foods. These two great discoveries eliminated dependence on precarious hunting and gathering, and made the founding of permanent human settlements possible. They are the indispensable basis for every human achievement since those ancient times.",

Our ancestors had begun to climb the long road to health, towards our present situation.

Permanent human settlements transformed ecosystems, and abiding by epidemic theory, the probability of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission of infection rose as population density increased. Ecological and evolutionary changes in micro-organisms account for the origins of diarrhea , measles, malaria, smallpox, plague, and many other diseases. Micro-organisms evolve rapidly because of their brief generation time and prolific reproduction rates. Many that previously had lived in symbiosis with animals began to invade humans, where they became pathogenic. Some evolved complex life cycles involving several host species, such as humans and other mammals, humans and arthropods, and humans and freshwater snails. These evolutionary changes in host-parasite relationships occurred at least several millennia before we had created written histories. Our oldest written records that have a bearing on health date back about 4,000 years. The Code of Hammurabi (c. 2000 BCE) contains ideas indicative of insight into the effects on health of diet and behaviour. It also suggests rewards and punishments for physicians who did their jobs well or poorly.",

            "text": "Information about the impact of diseases, especially of epidemic diseases, from those ancient times has come down to us in myths and biblical accounts of pestilences and plagues, although we cannot reliably identify the nature of the epidemics that afflicted ancient populations. The Greek historian Thucydides provided a meticulously careful description of an epidemic that struck the Athenians in the second year of the Peloponnesian War in 426 BCE, from which the forces of Athens perhaps never fully recovered. Modern infectious disease specialists have puzzled over this epidemic. Was it typhus, a virulent form of epidemic streptococcal infection, that is, a variant form of scarlet fever, or something completely different? Similar questions have been raised about other ancient epidemics, for instance the sweating sickness that recurred many times in mediaeval Europe then vanished, never to be seen again, almost 1,000 years ago. There has been debate too about the exact nature of the Black Death, the terrible pandemic that devastated Asia Minor and the whole of Europe in 1347-1350. This is usually attributed to the plague bacillus, Yersinia pestis, but revisionist historians and epidemiologists have raised the possibility that other pathogens, for instance, the anthrax bacillus, might have been responsible. Here, as with the plague of the Athenians, the plague of Justinian, the medieval sweating sickness, the accounts of apparent fulminating epidemic syphilis (that may really have been another sexually transmitted disease or may have been caused by a highly virulent variant of the causative organism of syphilis, Treponema pallidum, which has slowly lost its extreme virulence and infectivity), and, indeed, as with all other great epidemics of historical times before the rise of modern microbiology, we can only speculate about the exact aetiology and pathogenesis. This is a rather sterile, albeit fascinating, quest.",

For well over a thousand years after Hippocrates' lifetime, human communities were afflicted with ever-present respiratory and gastrointestinal infections that cut deeply into the lives of everyone, and most deeply, as a rule, into the lives of young children who all too often died before they reached adolescence, carried off by measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, bronchitis, croup, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, or typhoid. From time to time, this steady drain on long life and good health was punctuated by great and terrifying epidemics-smallpox, typhus, influenza, and, most terrible of all, the plague, or the \"black death.\" The causes of these periodic devastations, the contributing reasons to why they happened, were a mystery. Many at the time believed they were God' s punishment for sin, or the work of evil spirits. Ideas about contagion were rudimentary, even though it had been dimly understood since antiquity that leprosy, perhaps the least contagious of all the infectious diseases, was associated with propinquity and uncleanliness.",

For over 100 years before his time, parishes had kept records of baptisms and deaths, and what was then understood about causes of death was inscribed in the Bills of Mortality. Graunt collected and analyzed these Bills of Mortality. He demonstrated statistical differences between males and females, between London and rural areas, and the ebb and flow of epidemics of plague. He published his work in Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality (London, 1662). This work was the foundation for the science of vital statistics. John Graunt demonstrated the importance of gathering facts in a systematic manner, to identify, characterize and classify health conditions of public health importance.

Lind thought this disease might be caused by a diet lacking fresh fruit and vegetables. He conducted an experiment, giving different diets to each of several pairs of sailors. This was the first clinical trial ever conducted-although the sample sizes were very small, there was no random allocation, and no informed consent was obtained from the sailors. The two sailors who received fresh oranges and lemons recovered rapidly from the scurvy, the others did not, or got worse. Lind also initiated the first effective measures aimed at enhancing hygiene in the British navy, but he is best known for his work on scurvy, reported in A Treatise of the Scurvy (1753). Not only was this the first reported clinical trial, it also was proof that a dietary deficiency can cause disease, that a well-balanced diet is essential for good health.

The frequency and ferocity of smallpox epidemics began to decline early in the 19 th century, but the disease remained a menace until the mid-20 th century. In 1949, the American epidemiologist Donald Soper worked out the strategy of containment, in other words, vaccinating all known contacts of every diagnosed case.

He began with a logical analysis of the available facts, which proved that cholera could not be caused by a 'miasma' (emanations from rotting organic matter) as proposed in a theory popular at that time, but must be caused by a transmissible agent, most probably in drinking water. He confirmed the proof with two epidemiological investigations into the great cholera epidemic of 1854. He studied a severe localized epidemic in Soho, using analysis of descriptive epidemiological data and spot maps to demonstrate that the cause was polluted water from a pump in Broad Street. His investigation of a more widespread epidemic in South London involved an inquiry into the source of drinking water used in over 700 households. He compared the water source in houses where cholera had occurred with that in others where it had not. His analysis of the information about cases and their sources of drinking water showed beyond doubt that the cause of the cholera outbreak was water that was being supplied to houses by the Southwark and Vauxhall water company, which drew its water from the Thames downriver, where many effluent discharges polluted the water. Very few cases occurred in households supplied with water by the Lambeth company, which collected water upstream from London, where there was little or no pollution. John Snow reasoned correctly that the cholera must be caused by some sort of agent in the contaminated water supply. This was a remarkable feat, completed 30 years before Robert Koch identified the cholera bacillus. Snow published his work in a monograph, On the Mode of Communication of Cholera (1855). This book has been reprinted in modern editions and is still used as a teaching text.",

Working in the obstetric wards of the Allgemeines Krankenhaus in Vienna, he tried to transform traditional but ineffective treatment methods by using logic and statistical analysis to demonstrate the efficacy, or lack of it, when he compared treatment regimens. He believed in the germ theory of disease and was convinced that the terrible death rates from puerperal sepsis must be caused by germs introduced into the raw uterine tissues by birth attendants who did not disinfect their hands. He carried out a meticulous comparative mortality study in his own wards, where he insisted that all birth attendants must cleanse their hands in a disinfectant solution of bleach, and other wards run by senior obstetricians where hand-washing was not routine. His senior colleagues regarded his findings as a gross insult to their professional competence. Semmelweiss' s rather abrasive nature and his Jewish origins in the anti-Semitic atmosphere of 19 th century Vienna made matters worse for him. He was hounded out of his hospital post, and ended his life in a mental hospital. His belatedly published comparative statistical analyses of the death rates from puerperal sepsis in his own and other wards of the Allgemeines Krankenhaus are a model of how to conduct such studies, but, unfortunately, no one in Vienna heeded him and young women continued to die of childbed fever for another generation.",

In 1854, he had recently been appointed professor of chemistry in Lille, and was invited to solve the problem of aberrant fermentation of beer that caused it to taste bad and made it undrinkable. He showed that the problem was caused by bacteria that were killed by heat. In this way he invented the process for heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria, first applied to fermentation of beer, then to milk-the process known ever since as pasteurization that has saved innumerable children from an untimely death. He went on to study and solve many other bacteriological problems in industry and animal husbandry. He developed attenuated vaccines, first to prevent chicken cholera, then, in 1881, to control anthrax, which was a serious threat to livestock and, as well, occasionally to humans. Before this, in 1880, he began experiments on rabies, seeking a vaccine to control this disease, which without treatment is invariably fatal.",

Experimenting with varieties of garden peas, he cross-pollinated them and observed and recorded the results. Unfortunately, he published his findings in an obscure journal where they remained un-noticed for many years, but when they were unearthed about 15 years after his death, Gregor Mendel was retroactively honoured as the father of a new science, genetics, which soon found many applications in clinical medicine, with the recognition of the fact that many inherited diseases were caused by genetic disorders. Almost 100 years after Mendel' s death, other discoveries with great public health relevance include development of genetically modified sterile insect vectors of disease, genetically resistant strains of rice, wheat, and so on, and applications of genetic engineering to limit and even control and prevent some recessive inherited disorders.",

This belief is the moral imperative that drives public health reforms. Geoffrey Vickers described the history of public health as a process of redefining the unacceptable-an endless process of identifying conditions, behaviors, and circumstances that individuals, communities, and cultures must no longer tolerate. Throwing the contents of the chamber pot into the street, clearing one' s nostrils on the tablecloth, coughing and spitting on the living-room floor, all became unacceptable in the late 19 th century. Many people outside the boundaries of traditional medical science and public health practice played a role in this process. In the era of the great reforms of the 19 th century, they included social reformers like Edwin Chadwick, journalists like Henry Mayhew and Charles Kingsley, novelists like Charles Dickens, cartoonists in Punch and other periodicals-all of whom were aided by the rise of literacy in that period. Collectively, they inspired a mood of public outrage that became an irresistible force for reform. In the second half of the 20 th century, this sense of moral outrage found new targets-lighting a cigarette without permission in someone else' s home, carrying infant and child passengers in a car without safety equipment, dumping toxic industrial waste where it harms others, and more. Yet, much else remains to be done.",

Since the 1950s it has been tobacco companies and a host of manufacturers of toxic petrochemical and other dangerous compounds released into the air and water.

Sadly, this is rarely recognized as a public health problem. The very first essential ingredient, awareness of the problem, is lacking. Both these massive public health problems, in my view, are linked to the insatiable human craving for petroleum fuels, an addiction far more pervasive and dangerous to mankind and the earth than addiction to tobacco.
