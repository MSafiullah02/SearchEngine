The second stage is associated with high fever, hypoxaemia, and progression of respiratory symptoms to bilateral pneumonia, although laboratory analyses reveal lower rates of viral replication toward the end of this stage. 8 In the third stage, approximately 20% of patients develop SARS, which is frequently fatal. 9,10 As viral replication progressively decreases during the final stage, the pathogenesis of SARS is thought to be explained by an exacerbated inflammatory response in the host (the so-called ''cytokine storm''), which causes diffuse alveolar damage and severe hypoxaemia, promoting the development of fatal secondary sepsis.",

In fact, it is an excessive, dysregulated innate immune response that may explain the severity of the associated symptoms. 11, 12 SARS-CoV invades such haematopoietic stem cells as dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, inducing lowlevel expression of antiviral cytokines (eg, IFN-\u2423\u2424) and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6) and inflammatory chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CCL2, CXCL10). 13 In contrast, patients with SARS-CoV infection and SARS show extremely low levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 14 and high levels of IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 and inflammatory chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 compared to patients with pneumonia, which suggests that IFN plays a role in the immunopathogenesis of SARS in humans. 14 At the time of writing, few published studies have addressed the dynamics of the cytokine storm in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Very recently, Chen et al. 15 reported that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lymphocytopaenia (with low levels of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells but normal B cell levels); increased levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-2R (soluble IL-2 receptor), IL-10, TNF-\u2423, and CCL2; and reduced expression of IFN-\u2425 in CD4 + T cells. IL-6, IL-2R, IL-10, and TNF-\u2423 levels are slightly elevated or remain within the normal range in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19, but are high in severe cases (Fig. 1) . The researchers suggest that the cytokine storm is associated with severe COVID-19, similarly to the observations reported for SARS-CoV infection. ",

Immune dysregulation may persist after infection in the form of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). This immune state is thought to be triggered by a cytokine storm during acute infection, such as COVID-19, and results from continuous release of endogenous alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) from damaged organs. This leads to chronic systemic inflammation and a shift from production of bone marrow stem cells to myeloid cells, which promotes chronic anaemia and lymphocytopaenia. 16 For obvious reasons, conclusive data on the possibility of persistent inflammation in COVID-19 survivors are not available; however, this hypothesis is plausible considering that PICS is associated with severity of acute infection.",

            "text": "In Alzheimer disease, for example, the presence of proinflammatory cytokines (mainly IL-1 and IL-6) inhibits beta amyloid (A\u2424) phagocytosis by microglial cells, which leads to pathogenic A\u2424 deposition. 19 This observation supports the hypothesis that the persistence and accumulation of amyloid plaques in vivo may be a direct consequence of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer disease display greater numbers of IL-1\u2423 microglial cells in cortical layers presenting amyloid plaque deposition. 20 In patients with Parkinson's disease, inflammatory mediators (including TNF, IL-1\u2424, IL-6, and IFN-\u2425) have been found in the CSF and in brain tissue studied post mortem. 21, 22 In another study, monkeys with MPTP-induced parkinsonism continued to show elevated TNF levels one year after MPTP administration, which suggests that TNF may play a role in neuronal death in toxic parkinsonism. 23 Post mortem studies reveal increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u2425, TNF, IL-2, and IL-22) and molecules involved in sustained B-cell activity and lymphoid neogenesis (CXCL13, CXCL10, LT\u2423, IL-6, and IL-10) in the meninges and CSF of patients with MS displaying high levels of meningeal inflammation. A similar proinflammatory pattern (increased levels of CXCL13, TNF, IFN-\u2425, CXCL12, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) has been observed in the CSF of patients with MS showing severe grey matter damage at the time of diagnosis. These findings may support the role of neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative phase of MS. 24 Interestingly, neuroinflammation has also been found to play a major role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases. Neuroinflammation can induce changes in neurotransmitter metabolism, cause hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, activate the microglia, alter neuroplasticity, and trigger structural and functional changes in the brain that may affect cognition and behaviour. Proinflammatory cytokine dysregulation constitutes the starting point for the disruption of these systems, explaining the pathogenesis of affective disorders and such other disorders as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and substance abuse, especially alcohol abuse. 25 The hypothesis that neuroinflammation plays a major role in the pathophysiology of acute neurological symptoms is increasingly accepted. For instance, the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of epileptic seizures and epileptic syndromes is widely acknowledged; in this case, it is secondary to microglial and astrocyte activation through the release of such inflammatory markers as IL-1\u2424, IL-6, and TNF in various brain regions, including the hippocampus and the neocortex. 26 Lastly, neuroinflammation is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of neurological diseases, including immune-mediated or postinfectious encephalitis, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral nervous system disorders. Strikingly, however, the immune response varies with age among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with older individuals displaying greater severity. The innate immune response is less efficient in older age, which makes these patients more vulnerable to infection. 27 Numerous studies suggest that a proinflammatory environment promotes the development of age-related diseases, and an association has been demonstrated between immunosenescence, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, as is observed in Alzheimer disease, where microglial dysfunction results in A\u2424 accumulation and the loss of peripheral immune response. 28 Given all this evidence, the nervous system seems to be a target for neuroinflammatory mechanisms. In the light of the above, special emphasis should be placed on understanding the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",

It has been hypothesised that death due to severe respiratory involvement is at least partially mediated by central hypoventilation syndrome secondary to invasion of the CNS. 35 A retrospective review of 214 consecutive patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan reports neurological symptoms in 36.4% of the sample; most of the patients with neurological manifestations had severe COVID-19, and the most frequently reported neurological symptoms were impaired consciousness, acute stroke (both ischaemic and haemorrhagic), and skeletal muscle damage. 36 Some patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have subsequently displayed evidence of CNS invasion. Using genome sequencing, researchers at Beijing Ditan Hospital detected +Model Impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases 5 Q1 SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF of a patient with COVID-19 and clinical encephalitis. 37 It is yet to be determined whether SARS-CoV-2 remains in the CNS in the medium or long term. However, viral latency in the CNS has been described for other viruses, including some coronaviruses. For instance, HCoV-OC43 was detected in the CNS over a year after inoculation in a murine model of coronavirus encephalitis. 38 The question of how the virus is able to persist in the CNS is subject to debate. It has been suggested that the cytolytic and inflammatory strategies that are effective in controlling viral infection of other organs cannot be employed by the immune system in the brain due to their potentially devastating consequences. As a result, a different type of immune response is induced in the CNS, favouring viral latency in the CNS and reactivation in favourable situations. 39 We cannot rule out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may remain latent in the CNS. If it does, we may observe delayedonset neurological symptoms due to viral reactivation in the medium or long term, which may result in reactivation of the series of neuroinflammatory processes associated with neurodegenerative disease.",
