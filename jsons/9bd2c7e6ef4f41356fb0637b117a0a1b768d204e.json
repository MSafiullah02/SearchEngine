Additional maternal and neonatal swabs were taken. Maternal sites included amniotic fluid, vaginal side walls, and rectum obtained prior to delivery. Newborn swabs were taken from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, oral mucosa, skin surface and rectum right after delivery.",

The patient met with the neonatal intensive care physicians for consultation prior to delivery to review hospital protocol for mother and baby separation in setting of COVID-19. Any healthcare personnel that entered her room for labor checks were following CDC guidelines for proper PPE, including eye protection, gown, gloves, and surgical mask. 2, 3 The patient had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery which was attended by two physicians from the Maternal Fetal Medicine and General OBGYN teams and two labor and delivery nurses. For delivery, PPE of all medical personnel included gown, gloves, bouffant disposable surgical cap, knee high shoe covers, eye protection, and N95 mask as there was concern for aerosolization during the second stage of labor. The patient wore a facemask at all times, including during the second stage of labor when she was pushing. ",

The respiratory viral panel included adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, four coronavirus variants (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43), metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza A and B, mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. Sputum cultures showed no growth except for normal respiratory flora, and urine antigen for legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae were negative. Urine analysis only showed minimal ketones. Two sets of blood cultures revealed no growth. Due to high demand in the laboratory for COVID-19 testing, maternal and newborn swabs have been collected and frozen but not yet processed.",
