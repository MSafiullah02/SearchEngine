Ultrasound evaluation is useful if rectal examination is not possible and can be an adjunct to those cases whereby rectal examination alone has not been diagnostic.\u2022The presence of dental disease and parasitism increases the risk of colic; donkeys and mules should be included in routine preventative dental care and anthelmintic use.\u2022Because of their unique physiology, donkeys differ in their response to dehydration and drug metabolism compared with horses.

Intravenous spasmolytics (hyoscine/scopolamine) at standard equine doses facilitate rectal examination. In unhandled donkeys and mules where rectal examination may be dangerous, heavy sedation and the use of stocks are indicated. Mules may require between one-third to one-half extra dose of sedatives compared with a similarly sized pony or horse.\u2022If rectal examination is not possible, information about the nature of the feces and hydration status is useful.\u2022Hyperlipemia is frequent in colicky and dull donkeys and can worsen the prognosis, and triglyceride measurement is indicated in these animals.\u2022As donkeys evolved in dry and arid environments with limited water access, they can better tolerate dehydration and hemoconcentration than horses.\u2022Transabdominal ultrasonography may be challenging in obese animals. Clipping their thick coat is recommended to facilitate image acquisition.\u2022Abdominocentesis can be unrewarding in donkeys because of significant fat deposits on the linea alba; a teat cannula or catheter may be indicated, preferably after ultrasound evaluation.\u2022A foal- or pony-sized tube can be used for evaluation of gastric reflux and nasogastric therapy.\u2022In countries where rabies is endemic, the possibility of infection with this zoonosis must be considered, in particular when performing oral or rectal examination.\u2022Donkeys without tetanus prophylaxis are susceptible to this condition and develop signs similar to other equids.\n",

Donkeys with gastric ulcer syndrome (DGUS) do not usually exhibit the clinical signs displayed by horses with equine gastric ulcer syndrome, likely because of their stoic nature. For example, 1 study of 39 donkeys without symptomatic evidence of gastric disease found lesions in the squamous gastric mucosa in 49% of animals, whereas only 2.6% had glandular disease.10 Postmortem data from The Donkey Sanctuary identified that most chronic gastric ulcers were located in the squamous area adjacent to the margo plicatus, whereas chronic active or acute ulcers affected both the glandular and the squamous part of the stomach in few animals (G. Paraschiou, personal communication, 2018). These findings are similar to those reported in Italy.10\n",

Simple cases can respond to osmotic reduction using sugar and lubrication to replace the prolapse, combined with anti-inflammatory drugs (see Fig. 5).
