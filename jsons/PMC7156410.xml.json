A UDS was more likely to be obtained in patients who were younger (age < 45), male, smokers, self-reported methamphetamine users, with more severe deficit at presentation (NIHSS > 4), without diabetes, or not taking anticoagulant. There was no significant difference in UDS among different races (p = 0.319)26. Therefore, the higher rates of Meth-ICH in Hispanics and Whites were not due to bias in ordering UDS. In addition, hypertensive ICH is very prevalent in Asians2. However, only 1.2% (2/166) Asians in this cohort had Meth-ICH.

Second, there was no significant difference in highest blood pressures, GCS, ICH score and ventilator support between Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH groups. Third, all ICH patients were initially managed in the dedicated Neuroscience ICU with standard ICH order-set and clinical pathway by board-certified neurointensivits at our center.

Rumbaugh et al. analyzed the angiographic features of patients with methamphetamine abuse and described beaded arteries, segmental changes in vessel caliber, and regions of slow flow35. In monkeys receiving intravenous methamphetamine for two weeks, angiography showed similar beading and segmental changes, and necropsy revealed small cerebral hemorrhages, zones of infarction, and microaneurysms36. Davis et al. reported 4.9% incidence of methamphetamine intoxication in all autopsies in San Diego County from 1 January 1987 to 31 December 1993 and suggested possible propagation and rupture of berry aneurysms from methamphetamine use37. Of note, methamphetamine is a potent sympathomimetic. ICH may also occur secondary to methamphetamine-induced hypertensive surge in the absence of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease38. Chronic use of methamphetamine may cause long-term systemic hypertension and vessel damage13,17,27,39. Further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms of Meth-ICH.",

Third, in this retrospective study, there was no information about the route (inhalation, ingestion or injection), frequency, and duration of methamphetamine use in most patients. The temporal relationship between recent methamphetamine use and ICH onset could not be established. In addition, UDS is only sensitive in detecting amphetamines within 4 days of recent use and may not identify chronic users. Lastly, patients may have history of polysubstance abuse. Of note, cocaine and excessive alcohol use are also risk factor for ICH40,41.
