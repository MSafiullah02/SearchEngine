ACE-2 expression is not limited to the respiratory system, being very represented also in other tissues like gut, heart, kidney as well as arterial and venous endothelial cells in all organs studied [5] (Fig. 1). Similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the receptors and co-receptors are expressed also on cells of haematopoietic origin [6], SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect and cause damage to T lymphocytes, despite their very low expression levels of ACE-2, which argues in favour of an alternate receptor allowing viral entry into these cells, where the virus is not able to replicate [7].",

COVID-19-affected patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy [20], with a concurrent massive elevation of von Willebrand Factor [21] towards massive endothelial stimulation and damage with release of von Willebrand Factor from Weibel\u2013Palade bodies. In Chinese, Italian and French cohorts of COVID-19-affected patients, a substantial increase in D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, along with a longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time has additionally been documented as compared to uninfected patients [18, 20, 22]. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, along with longer prothrombin and activated thromboplastin times were observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects who did not survive, with the 71.4% frequency of DIC in non-survivors and 0.6% in survivors highlighting the critical role played by such condition in COVID-19 severity and associated deaths [23].",

ACE-2 function, following SARS-CoV binding, is reduced due to endocytosis and proteolytic cleavage [33] and there are high levels of Ang II in the blood of patients with COVID-19 [34, 35]. Consequently, the up-regulation of human ACE-2 induced by RAAS-antagonists in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients could be clinically useful, due to the cardiovascular protection elicited by the increased activity of angiotensin(1\u20137), thereby attenuating angiotensin II effects on vasoconstriction and sodium retention [31, 34]. In vivo ACE-2 deficiency results in augmented vascular inflammation and plaque instability [36], while its overexpression has been also shown to reduce left ventricular damage during myocardial infarction [37]. It has been additionally suggested that ACE-2 plays a key role in the reduction of left ventricular remodelling as well as in preserving ventricular function in humans [38].",

The fact that the ACE-2-encoding gene is located on chromosome X [40] could be a relevant factor in this regard. The SARS-CoV-2 uses the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), an androgen-regulated gene, for viral spike protein priming [1]. ACE-2 receptor polymorphisms have, in silico, different affinities for the spike proteins SARS-CoV-2 [41\u201343]. Another confounding factor is smoke, with cigarette smoking increasing ACE-2 expression not only in experimental models [44] but also in humans [45] notwithstanding the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine. Respiratory tract inflammation can expand ACE-2 receptor availability for respiratory cell infection by SARS-CoV-2. This point is also controversial [46], with the percentage of COVID-19-affected patients admitted to intensive care units in China being almost double in current smokers than in non-smokers [10].",

In spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with losartan, ACE-2 increased in renal but not in cardiac tissues [48]. In contrast, patients treated with ACE-Is and ARBs show an ACE-2 down-regulation at the mRNA and protein levels in kidney and cardiac tissues [49]. Angiotensin II is also able to up-regulate ACE and down-regulate ACE-2 in human kidney tubular cells, which were blocked by an AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan), but not by an AT2 receptor blockade [49].",

With the aim of reinforcing the above-reported statements, some very recent studies further contribute to clarify the debate [54\u201356]. In a retrospective study on 1128 hospitalized COVID-19-affected patients with hypertension, including patients taking ACE-Is (17%) or ARBs (83%) with a median age of 64\u201366 years (about 52% of whom males) and an additional 940 COVID-19-affected patients treated by other anti-hypertensive drugs with a median age of 64 years (about 53% of whom males), the unadjusted case-fatality rate was either significantly lower in the former group versus the non-ACE-Is/ARB group (3.7% vs. 9.8%, P = 0.01) [55, 56], or both groups were equal in terms of severe disease and deaths [54]. Nevertheless, the Chinese cohorts consisted of younger patients and had less comorbidities than the Italian CoViD-19-affected patients who succumbed to the disease. Interestingly, the platelet count was significantly lower [55], similarly to the prothrombin time [54] and the D-dimer [56] levels, in the ACE-Is- or ARB-treated, COVID-19-affected patients. After multivariate analysis for age, sex, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications [56], the adjusted HR for the ACE-Is/ARB group was 0.42 (95% CI 0.19\u20130.92; P = 0.03). The cautious conclusion of the authors, due to the intrinsic limitations of a retrospective study, was that \u201cit is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACE-inhibitors/ARBs was associated with an increased mortality risk\u201d [56]. Four very recent retrospective studies did not find any influence of the two RAAS-inhibitors on the clinical course [57], the rate of in-hospital death [58] or propensity of developing COVID-19 infection [59, 60].",
