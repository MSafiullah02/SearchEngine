His mother reported that 4 days prior he had been suffering from a sore throat and fever and was given two doses of an over-the-counter (OTC) product (originating from the Philippines) containing paracetamol (acetaminophen). Clinical examination revealed oropharingeal erythema, red strawberry tongue, cheilitis, and a severe itchy erythema of the trunk that extended to the arms and legs, covered with hundreds of white micropustules. Inguinal folds were spared, as the abdominal one. Somewhere small islands of intact skin were seen intermingled with affected skin (Fig. 1a) .",

The boy was given ampicillin-sulbactam 150 mg/kg, and a bland emollient lotion was used on the body surface. On the third day, fever subsided and general conditions started to improve (Fig. 1c) . The skin completely healed by desquamation in 10 days. Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis (14 9 10 9 /l) with striking neutrophilia (up to 9.9 9 10 9 /l) and elevated CRP (94.3 mg/l). Tests for influenza A and B virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, RSV, mycoplasma pneumonia, CMV, EBV, Group A streptococcus pyogenes, and toxoplasma gondii were all negative. Only Group A streptococci on throat swab was found positive. Due to the rapid healing, no skin biopsy was carried out.",

Three months later, the patient was submitted to patch tests containing paracetamol 1-10% (with readings extended at 96 and 120 h) not using the commercialized form provided by the patient which was no more available at the moment of the test. They failed to reveal sensitization. No relapses at 9 and 18 months follow-up.",

Kardaun et al. (9) have also proposed a spectrum of differential histopathologic features. Considering the usual benign and self-limited course, greater awareness of AGEP as a clinical entity in pediatric patients is needed to improve prompt clinical recognition and avoid useless invasive examinations such as skin biopsy and unnecessary systemic treatment: the association of pustules, hyperpyrexia, and leukocytosis can be misunderstood as acute infective disease, but a pustule not always means bacterial infection. Awareness to rare but potentially serious cutaneous adverse reactions to paracetamol is needed.",
