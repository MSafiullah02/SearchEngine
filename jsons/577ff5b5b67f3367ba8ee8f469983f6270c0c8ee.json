We developed the 36-item COVID Stress Scales (CSS) to measure these features, as they pertain to COVID-19. The CSS were developed to better understand and assess COVID-19-related psychopathology. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. The CSS were developed and initially validated in population-representative samples from Canada (N=3,479) and the United States (N=3,375). A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to scales assessing COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking, and (5) traumatic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 COVID Stress Scales stress symptoms about COVID-19.

These findings are similar to those reported during the SARS outbreak (Cheng et al., 2004) and in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Rubin et al., 2009 ). Studies of previous epidemics and pandemics show that anxiety, or the lack thereof, is an important driver of behavior (Taylor, 2019) . People with too little anxiety about a viral outbreak are less likely to engage in hygiene behaviors (e.g., handwashing), less likely to adhere to physical distancing mandates, and are less likely to get vaccinated if a vaccine is available (Taylor, 2019) . On the other hand, people with excessive anxiety are more likely to engage in socially disruptive behaviors, such as panic buying and surging unnecessarily into hospitals and clinics when they misinterpret their minor ailments as signs of serious infection (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020a,b) .",

To date, there has been little empirical attention devoted to this issue; indeed, while several measures of COVID-19-related fears have recently emerged (e.g., Ahorsu et al., 2020) , they tend to be unidimensional (i.e., focused on general fear aspects of and are based on limited psychometric evaluation. There is a pressing need to develop an empiricallysound measure of COVID-19-related stress and anxiety-related symptoms. Research and clinical observations (e.g., Taylor, 2019) suggest that during times of pandemic many people exhibit stress-or anxiety-related psychopathology that include the following: Fear of becoming infected, fear of coming into contact with possibly contaminated objects or surfaces, fear of foreigners who might be carrying infection (i.e., disease-related xenophobia), fear of the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic (e.g., job loss), compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking regarding possible pandemic-related threats, and traumatic stress symptoms about the pandemic (e.g., nightmares, intrusive thoughts). The COVID-19 Stress Scales (CSS) were developed to measure the aforementioned features as well as to better understand and assess COVID-19-related psychopathology. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. In the present study we examined the factor structure, reliability as internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity of the CSS. To determine the robustness (replicability) of the findings, results from a Canadian sample were replicated in an American sample.",

Five items were culled on rational bases (see supplement), leaving 53 items for analysis. To simplify the instructions, we referred to COVID-19 as \"the virus.\" COVID-19 actually refers to the disease and SARS-CoV-2 is the virus; however, we expected that many respondents would not be aware of this distinction. Based on feedback from pilot testing, respondents readily understood what we were referring to. We assessed a 7-day window because fears about COVID-19 may change over time as the pandemic unfolds. A 7-day window provides the ability to assess these changes while also keeping the window broadly consistent with the other symptom measures included in our assessment battery.",

Internal consistency for the 14-item subscale in the present study was excellent, alpha = .90. Foa et al., 2002) . The OCI-R measures symptoms characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The two subscales of checking (e.g., \"I check more things than necessary\") and washing (e.g., \"I sometimes have to wash or clean myself simply because I feel contaminated\") were used in this study, each comprising three items rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The OCI-R demonstrates good reliability, good convergent and discriminant validity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 10 COVID Stress Scales (Abramowitz & Deacon, 2006; Foa et al., 2002; Hajcak et al., 2004) . Internal consistency in the present study was good for the subscales, alpha = .86 for both. (XS; Van Zalk, Kerr, van Zalk, & Stattin, 2013) . The XS measures negative attitudes towards immigrants (e.g., \"Immigrants increase criminality\") using 12 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (don't agree at all) to 4 (agree completely). The original measure made reference to Sweden. For the current measure, all references to \"Sweden\" were changed to \"our country\" so that items were applicable to all participants. The XS has demonstrated good reliability, high temporal stability, and convergent validity (Van Zalk & Kerr, 2014; Van Zalk et al., 2013) . One item from the Xenophobia Scale (Wilson-Daily, Kemmelmeier, & Prats, 2018), \"Immigrants abuse the health system and fill up our emergency rooms,\" was added to our modified XS, given its potential relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic. The addition of this item improved internal consistency of the xenophobia subscale from alpha = .86 to .90 and, therefore, was retained. (MCSD-SF; Reynolds, 1982) . The MCSD-SF Scale measures the tendency to respond in socially desirable ways using 13 items (e.g., \"I sometimes try to get even rather than forgive and forget\") with \"true\" (1) or \"false\" (0) response options. The 13-item version has demonstrated to have better reliability and fit compared to the original Marlowe-Crowne Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960) ; but, the shortened version is still highly correlated with the original scale (Fischer & Fick, 1993; Reynolds, 1982) . Internal consistency for the full scale in the present study was acceptable, alpha = .72.",

Results were conducted separately for each country to determine whether the findings were robust (i.e., replicable). For each country and for each of the six scales of the CSS, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted using robust Maximum Likelihood (RML) using MPlus (Muthen & Muthen, 2017) . That is, Maximum Likelihood using robust standard errors. RML was used because it is robust to departures from normality in the data distribution. For each scale, parallel analysis (Patil et al., 2017 ) indicated a single factor. That is, each scale had a single underlying factor. For the factor for each scale, the items with the six highest loadings were retained. This resulted in the creation of six 6-item scales. Six items were selected because we had previously found, in studies of other anxietyrelated phenomena, that 6-item subscales provided a good balance between brevity and reliability (Taylor et al., 2007) . Item selection was replicated across countries; that is, for each scale, the items with the top six loadings in the Canadian sample were the same as the items with the top six loadings in the United States sample (see supplement).",

This finding indicates that a socially desirable response set was essentially unrelated to scores on the CSS. Table 5 shows the tests of the differences between correlations with general anxiety versus depression for each of the subscales of the CSS. This is a highly stringent and, in some ways, contentious test of discriminant validity, in part because if a given variable leads to anxiety, depression is a common consequence. Accordingly, for many measures of anxietyrelated symptoms (e.g., OC symptoms), it has historically been very difficult to show that they are more strongly correlated with anxiety than depression (e.g., Taylor, 1995) . Nevertheless, Table 5 shows that for most scales of the CSS, the correlations with current anxiety were significantly greater than the correlations with current depression. This finding supports the discriminant validity of the CSS. Table 6 provides further support for discriminant validity. Here, the mean correlations for general distress (i.e., correlations of the CSS with the measures of general anxiety, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 16 COVID Stress Scales depression, and the pre-COVID trait measures of health anxiety and OC symptoms) were compared to the correlations with general, pre-COVID xenophobia as measured using the XS.",

The scales performed well on various indices of reliability and validity. The scales were intercorrelated, loading on a single higher-order factor, thereby providing evidence of a COVID-19 Stress Syndrome. The scales offer promise as tools for better understanding the psychopathology associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services. The CSS can also be used in studies to predict which people are most likely to engage in safety behaviors. For example, the CSS could be used to investigate which people are most J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 17 COVID Stress Scales likely to engage in hygiene behaviors, social distancing, and the uptake of a vaccine, when one becomes available.",

These predictions are based on prior pandemics, where anxiety, depression, and traumatic reactions were observed (such as following quarantine due to SARS; Hawryluck, et al., 2004; Taylor, 2019) . Accordingly, the development of a pandemic-specific measure such as the CSS can serve to aid in identifying individuals at risk for adverse emotional reactions both during and post-pandemic. This can then aid public health officials in allocating resources for mental health interventions. The measure can also be further investigated for its predictive utility for returning to functioning post-pandemic. This is also, to our knowledge, the first assessment of pandemic-related emotional responses that includes specific evaluation of xenophobia as a contributory factor in fear and avoidance. This is an important consideration in any preparation for public health officials in addressing emotional and behavioral responses to potential pandemics. The role of xenophobic reactions, in conjunction with other emotional indicators such as those identified in the CSS (i.e., COVID danger and contamination, COVID socioeconomic consequences, COVID traumatic stress, and COVID checking and reassurance seeking) deserves additional investigation, such as with individuals at risk for post-pandemic adverse reactions.",

Future research is needed to investigate this issue.
