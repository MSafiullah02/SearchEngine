            "text": "It has been over 100 years since the existence of immunoglobulin (Ig) Y was first described by Klemperer (1893). It was found to be the major serum antibody in hens, and termed IgY due to its enrichment in egg yolk (Leslie and Clem, 1969). Since then, the avian immune system, and IgY, has been studied extensively, revealing many important characteristics and applications of IgY. The laying hen is an ethical alternative for the production of large quantities of specific antibodies at a low cost (Schade and Hlinak, 1996). Owing to its favorable immunochemical characteristics when compared to mammalian IgG, IgY has found many applications in the medical and research fields, including areas such as diagnostics and biomarker discovery. IgY has perhaps received the most attention for its immunotherapeutic potential. Passive immunotherapy, the administration of pre-formed antibodies to prevent infectious diseases or treat existing conditions, may be one of the most valuable applications of antibodies, and is currently driven by the need to find alternatives to traditional antibiotic therapy (Reilly et al., 1997, Carlander et al., 2000). Antibody therapy is, however, often limited by the significant amount of antibody required for treatment (Hatta et al., 1997b). Since IgY is transferred in large quantities to the egg yolk, and can easily be extracted and isolated, eggs are an ideal source of specific antibodies for passive immunotherapy.",

            "text": "The avian immune system is made up of the bursa of Fabricius, bone marrow, spleen, thymus, the Harderian gland, lymph nodes, circulating lymphocytes and various lymphoid tissues. The thymus serves as the primary lymphoid organ for T-cell differentiation, while the antibody-synthesizing B-cells are produced in the bursa of Fabricius (Sharma, 1997, Carlander et al., 1999a). The spleen is the centre for plasma cell proliferation and memory B cells (Carlander et al., 1999a). The vertebrate immune system has the ability to produce an exceedingly high number of different antibody molecules, through the existence of multiple variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) elements in the genome (the germ line repertoire), as well as existence of somatic recombination processes and point mutations (Reynaud et al., 1985, Parvari et al., 1988). In the avian immune system, however, this combinatorial diversity is restricted, as the rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes is not an ongoing process, but rather takes place as a single wave during early embryogenesis. The total number of rearrangements from which the chicken B-cell repertoire may be generated is limited to the number of B-cell precursors in the bursa (Reynaud et al., 1989, Reynaud et al., 1991), estimated to be around 2\u20133 \u00d7 104 cells (Pink et al., 1985). Despite the fact that chickens have an extremely limited number of immunoglobulin genes compared with mammals, they are capable of producing a wide range of immune responses and diverse antibody molecules (Sharma, 1997).",

IgY, the functional equivalent of mammalian IgG, is the major antibody produced by chickens, and makes up approximately 75% of the total antibody population (Carlander et al., 2000). During egg formation, serum IgY is selectively transferred to the yolk via a receptor on the surface of the yolk membrane specific for IgY translocation, in order to confer passive immunity to the developing embryo (Fig. 17.1\n) (Loeken and Roth, 1983, Tressler and Roth, 1987, Morrison et al., 2002, West et al., 2004, Tesar et al., 2008). Egg yolk can contain between 5 to 25 mg/mL of IgY, whereas IgA and IgM are found in the egg white, at concentrations of around 0.15 and 0.7 mg/mL respectively (Rose et al., 1974, Schade et al., 1991, Li et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Several aspects of hen immunization, including the immunization route and vaccine adjuvant, have been studied in an effort to improve IgY production and yolk deposition (Levesque et al., 2007). Chang et al. (1999) demonstrated that intramuscular immunization resulted in higher levels of specific IgY when compared with immunization via the subcutaneous route. Oil-based adjuvants, such as Freund\u2019s complete (FCA) and incomplete (FIA) adjuvant, continue to be the adjuvants of choice for IgY production (Trott et al, 2008); however, alternatives are continually being sought due to potentially severe injection site reactions (Wanke et al, 1996). The inclusion of bacterial components or immunostimulants in vaccine formulations has been shown to increase antigen-specific antibody levels in the yolk, and may require fewer injections and less antigen, and ultimately be more cost effective (Levesque et al., 2007, Trott et al., 2008, Herath et al., 2010). In fact, Levesque et al. (2007) found that adding synthetic oligonucleotides containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, characteristic of bacterial DNA (CpG ODNs), to FIA could increase specific IgY production by 480%. The use of DNA vaccines has also been described for IgY production (Romito et al., 2001, Cova, 2005, Witkowski et al., 2009). This process involves immunizing birds with plasmid DNA encoding the antigen of interest, and not only avoids the potentially costly and tedious preparation of purified antigens, but can also overcome interference by maternal antibodies (Elazab et al., 2009).",

One of the major challenges in IgY purification is separating the water-soluble IgY from the yolk lipoproteins (Hatta et al., 2008). IgY purification typically involves isolation of the IgY-containing water-soluble fraction (WSF), followed by additional purification steps. Simple dilution of the yolk with water, which results in the aggregation of yolk lipoproteins at low ionic strength (Jensenius et al., 1981), followed by centrifugation or ultrafiltration (UF), has been reported for the isolation of WSF (Akita and Nakai, 1992, Kim and Nakai, 1996, Kim and Nakai, 1998). Likewise, freezing and thawing of diluted yolk, producing lipid aggregates that are large enough to be removed by conventional low speed centrifugation (Jensenius and Koch, 1993), has also been employed, resulting in a purity of around 70% (Deignan et al., 2000). For these dilution methods, pH and extent of dilution are very important for optimal IgY recovery, and Nakai et al. (1994) found that the best results were obtained using a six-fold water dilution, at pH 5.0.",

To address this problem, natural polysaccharides, which have been found to act as effective yolk lipoprotein coagulating agents (Hatta et al., 2008), have been employed, including sodium alginate (Hatta et al., 1988, Hatta et al., 1990), xanthan gum (Akita and Nakai, 1993) and \u03b1-carrageenan (Hatta et al., 1990).

In addition, the hinge region of IgY is shorter and less flexible (Warr et al., 1995), and the content of \u03b2-sheet structure in the constant domains of IgY has been reported to be lower (Shimizu et al., 1992), which may account for the differences in stability observed between IgY and IgG.",

However, the stability of IgY under various processing and physiological conditions needs to be considered when they are to be used in industrial, food or medical applications (Shimizu et al., 1993b). IgY is stable in the pH range of 4\u20139, and up to temperatures of 65 \u00b0C (Shimizu et al., 1992; K. A. Lee et al., 2002), however this range may be extended by the addition of stabilizers such as sugars, complex carbohydrates, or polyols (Shimizu et al., 1994, Chang et al., 2000; K. A. Lee et al., 2002). IgY is relatively resistant to treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin, but sensitive to pepsin digestion (Shimizu et al., 1988). Hatta et al. (1993b) found that almost all of the IgY activity was lost following digestion with pepsin; however, activity remained even after 8 hours incubation with trypsin or chymotrypsin.",

In order to circumvent the inactivation of IgY following oral administration, a number of encapsulation techniques have been examined. The microencapsulation of IgY using liposomes (Shimizu et al., 1993a) and multiple emulsions (Shimizu and Nakane, 1995) have been previously described; however, these have shown limited effectiveness, in some cases destroying antibody activity by the encapsulation procedure itself. The macroencapsulation of IgY using enteric-coated gelatin capsules has also been examined, and was found to significantly improve antibody stability (Akita and Nakai, 2000). The use of a pH-sensitive methacrylic acid copolymer and chitosan\u2013alginate microcapsules (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2005, Li et al., 2007, Li et al., 2009a, Li et al., 2009b) have also been shown to increase IgY stability to gastric conditions both in vitro as well as in vivo.\n",

Specific IgY, which can easily be produced on a large scale required for industrial applications, would provide an ideal replacement for other polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies currently used in immunoaffinity chromatography (Li-Chan, 2000). Although IgY is more sensitive to low pH than IgG, it was found that an IgY immunoaffinity column was capable of retaining stability when subjected to standard affinity chromatography conditions, and could be reused over 50 times without a significant decrease in binding capacity (Akita and Li-Chan, 1998).",

The depletion of abundant proteins from complex biological samples containing a wide dynamic range of protein concentrations, such as plasma, serum and urine, prior to twodimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE) and mass spectrometry presents a significant challenge for proteomic analysis (Huang and Fang, 2008, Magagnotti et al., 2010). Immunoaffinity fractionation is one of the most effective methods used during sample preparation to improve the ability to detect low-abundance proteins (Huang and Fang, 2008). Owing to the ease of production of IgY and the ability to produce high affinity antibodies against conserved mammalian proteins, IgY is now widely used for immunoaffinity protein depletion in proteomic applications and biomarker discovery (Qian et al., 2008, Rajic et al., 2009, Polaskova et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Antibodies serve as essential components in a variety of diagnostic assays used for the qualitative and quantitative determination of a wide range of substances (Schade and Hlinak, 1996). While the antigen-binding specificity of IgY is comparable to that of IgG (Hatta et al., 1997b), IgY presents several advantages that make it well suited for applications in medical diagnostics. A number of proteins exist whose amino acid sequences are well preserved among mammals, and when used as an antigen in mammals have limited or no antigenicity (Hatta et al., 2008). Evolutionary differences allow the production of high avidity IgY against conserved mammalian proteins, with a more diversified antibody repertoire than is possible in mammals (Olovsson and Larsson, 1993, Woolley and Landon, 1995, Carlander et al., 1999a). The use of IgY as a substitute for IgG in clinical testing can potentially eliminate false positives and often results in low background and less interference (Xiao and Gao, 2010). Human serum samples often contain an active complement system, which would be activated by mammalian antibodies. IgY, which does not activate the human complement system, eliminates the interference that would otherwise be caused by IgG (Larsson and Mellstedt, 1992). Human serum can also contain rheumatoid factor (RF) and human anti-mouse IgG antibodies (HAMA), which are well-known causes of false-positive reactions in immunological assays (Carlander et al., 1999a). RF reacts with the Fc portion of IgG, and HAMA, which can occur naturally in human serum, will bind to any mouse antibodies being used in an immunoassay (Carlander et al., 1999a). Since IgY does not react with RF (Larsson and Sjoquist, 1988, Larsson et al., 1991) or HAMA (Larsson and Mellstedt, 1992), it has been suggested as a replacement for IgG in immunological assays of human serum.",

            "text": "\nSalmonella Enteritidis (SE) and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) are the main causes of salmonellosis outbreaks in humans and infections in chickens (E. N. Lee et al., 2002). Salmonella possesses several surface components which are virulence related, including outer membrane protein (OMP) (Isibasi et al., 1988), flagella (Fla) and, in some strains, fimbrial antigens (Thorns et al., 1990, Thorns et al., 1992). The ability of IgY specific for OMP, LPS or flagella (Fla), to passively protect against experimental salmonellosis in mice has been demonstrated. In vitro using a cultured human intestinal cell line (Caco-2), Chalghoumi et al. (2009) found that IgY against OMP of SE and ST reduced the Salmonella-induced decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of the infected Caco-2 cell monolayers and blocked Salmonella sp. adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that passive immunization with Salmonella OMP-specific IgY could be useful to prevent Salmonella colonization in broiler chickens and the subsequent carcass contamination during processing. In vivo in mice challenged with SE or ST, treatment with IgY against OMP, LPS or Fla resulted in a significantly higher survival rate when compared to control mice (Yokoyama et al, 1998b). Salmonella infection in calves is also a significant problem, with ST and S. dublin accounting for most cases of salmonellosis. Passive protection against ST and S. dublin was investigated by challenging calves with SE or S. dublin, and then orally administering anti-SE or anti-S. dublin IgY. All control calves died within 7\u201310 days, whereas only fever and diarrhea were observed in calves given the high titer IgY (Yokoyama et al., 1998a).",

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 is one of the key pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of IBD (Garside, 1999) and immunotherapy using monoclonal mouse antibodies against TNF-\u03b1 has been approved for use; however, it can be costly and adverse side effects have been reported in patients receiving systemic anti-TNF therapy (Sandborn and Hanauer, 1999). Worledge et al.

Finally, the production and testing of IgY against influenza virus H5N1 and H1N1 has also been described. When administered before or after infection, the IgY prevented mice from infection and significantly reduced viral replication resulting in complete recovery from the disease, suggesting that IgY may be a safe and affordable alternative method for the control of influenza outbreaks (Nguyen et al., 2010).",

There have been several reports of the production and neutralization of venom by chicken anti-venom IgY (Paul et al., 2007, Meenatchisundaram et al., 2008a, Meenatchisundaram et al., 2008b, Araujo et al., 2010), including the production of polyvalent anti-African snake venom IgY to be used against bites of several different snakes (de Almeida et al., 2008). IgY was found to have a higher bioactivity than anti-venoms traditionally raised in horses (Thalley and Carroll, 1990, De Almeida et al., 2008), and also has a lower likelihood of producing side effects such as serum sickness and anaphylactic shock, which can occur upon administration of mammalian serum proteins (Thalley and Carroll, 1990).",

Infection with rabies virus causes encephalitis in humans that has a case fatality rate of almost 100% (Johnson et al., 2010). Motoi et al., 2005a, Motoi et al., 2005b reported the production of anti-rabies IgY, raised against a part of the G protein of rabies virus. In vitro, these antibodies bound virions and cells infected with the rabies virus, and neutralized rabies virus infectivity. Administration of anti-rabies IgY to mice infected with rabies virus reduced mortality caused by the virus, suggesting that IgY directed against the rabies virus G protein could serve as a possible alternative to currently available anti-rabies human or equine immunoglobulins (Motoi et al., 2005b).",

            "text": "Transgenic pigs are promising donor organisms for xenotransplantation as they share many anatomical and physiological characteristics with humans (Klymiuk et al., 2010); however one of the most important barriers with such xenografts is hyperacute rejection, mediated by natural antibodies in humans against pig antigens, complement fixation, and the rapid onset of intravascular coagulation (Sandrin and McKenzie, 1994). The major target of these natural antibodies is the carbohydrate epitope, Gal\u03b11-3Gal, which is expressed by all mammals except for humans, apes, and some monkeys. Besides humans and monkeys, chickens also lack Gal\u03b11-3Gal expression (Bouhours et al., 1998). Since IgY does not bind human complement or Fc-receptors, anti-\u03b1-Gal IgY may be a suitable candidate for use as blocking antibodies to inhibit the interactions that may contribute to xenograft rejection. Fryer et al. (1999) demonstrated that anti-\u03b1-Gal IgY blocked human xenoreactive antibody binding to both porcine and rat tissues in vitro, and inhibited lysis of porcine cells by human serum, suggesting that IgY could be of potential use in inhibiting pig-to-human xenograft rejection. Anti-\u03b1-Gal IgY was also found to significantly reduce the infectivity of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), an \u03b1-Gal bearing virus which has emerged as a potential zoonotic agent, with possible pig-to-human transmission (Leventhal et al, 2001).",

Indeed, the immunization of hens represents an ideal alternative to efficiently generate large quantities of polyclonal antibodies since housing is inexpensive, egg collection is non-stressful and non- invasive, and the isolation and purification of IgY is relatively simple and high-yielding (Zhang, 2003). Recently, it has also been suggested that the selective transport of IgY from the blood into the egg yolk may also provide a new strategy for delivering substances into the egg yolk in an attempt to produce designer eggs (Bae et al., 2010), and may further expand the application of IgY. Immunization protocols and adjuvant systems continue to be modified in order to increase specific antibody production, and the identification and production IgY against of new antigens will continue to lead to new applications of egg yolk antibodies for human health and research applications.",
