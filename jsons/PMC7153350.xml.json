            "text": "Polyclonal immunoglobulins have been in use since the 19th century to protect against infectious agents, toxins, and disease conditions such as those with an autoimmune etiology. These immunoglobulin preparations are made from pools of selected human donors or animals with high titers of antibodies against viruses and toxins. These antibody treatments provide passive transfer of high titer antibodies that either reduces risk or reduces severity of infection. They are used to prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn and modify inflammatory reactions. Earlier drugs were very nonselective and patients frequently succumbed to infection due to suppression of both antibody-mediated (humoral) and cell-mediated arms of the immune system. Today, the principal approach is to alter lymphocyte function using drugs or antibodies against immune proteins. However, with the advent of human organ and tissue transplantation (e.g., kidney, heart, bone marrow, and/or peripheral blood stem cells) as treatment options, these polyclonal antibody therapies in combination with other treatment regimens are being used to lower the ability of the body's immune system to reject these transplants. However, their use is not without risk, as complications include development of immune complexes and severe allergic reactions. A summary of these polyclonal antibody therapies may be found in Table 16.2.\n",

Other actions can block receptor interaction with ligands by either binding with ligands or their cognate receptors (i.e., allow activation of NK cells). Interactions may also directly cause initiation of programmed cell death (apoptosis), cessation of growth/replication/proliferation, or lead to changes in metabolism.

These diseases may be classified as ulcerative colitis (UC), isolated to the colon, or Crohn's disease primarily found in the colon but may involve the entire gastrointestinal tract. With long-standing active disease, malignancy is much more frequent in UC than in Crohn's disease. Mild UC is treated with antiinflammatory agents such as sulfasalazine and glucocorticosteroids. For more severe disease, high-dose steroids may be used to maintain disease quiescent and low-dose steroids to keep disease in remission. Low-dose chemotherapeutic agent or immunosuppressive agent may also be added if dose of corticosteroids is too high to maintain remission. Surgery may be necessary to control disease. For Crohn's disease, medical therapy is usually less successful in managing the disease and surgery may be necessary but is not curative as in UC. For both of these disease processes, passive antibody therapy may offer not only control of disease but possible complete remission from mucosal damage.263, 264\n",

Increased utilization of the classic polyclonal antibody preparations continue especially in the realm of infections. In the past 3 years, monoclonal therapy has evolved and revolutionized treatment in many areas. As targets are identified to modify disease pathology no matter its genre we continue to get a better handle on morbidity and mortality. We are learning that not only is the target important put the portion of the target mediating the effect we intend to modify is also important. Importantly, modification of antibodies to be more compatible with the immune system while decreasing rapidity of clearance also allows for more consistent therapy. There are also many targets yet to be discovered or only now being developed as in the canonical wingless/integrated (WNT) signaling. This receptor family is important in a multitude of diseases not limited to: hereditary colorectal cancer, various types of sporadic cancers, intellectual disability syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, bone diseases, and vascular diseases. One monoclonal antibody rosmantuzumab (OMP-131R10), a humanized Mab (IgG1\u03ba), is in phase I trials to treat colorectal cancer.329, 330 Other disease processes have yet to find their optimal therapy (Alzheimer's) or are advancing to fuller therapeutic benefit. The future is wide open for this newer class of pharmaceuticals as they continue to develop to full fruition.",
