A milestone in the technical evolution of cardiopulmonary bypass and ECMO was the development of membrane oxygenators instead of bubble oxygenators in the 1960s, leading to increased short- and long-term biocompatibility. Bartlett and colleagues reported the first case series of 28 patients (14 children, 14 adults) who were treated with ECMO in 1977.[16] Although only five of 28 patients were long-term survivors, the early successes in near-moribund patients led to the first randomized trials of ECMO therapy for respiratory failure in neonates. The first of these trials used a non-traditional \u201cplay-the-winner\u201d randomization technique, where the chance of assigning an infant to a treatment was influenced by the outcome of previous patients in the study. All 11 high-risk patients who were treated with ECMO survived (although 1 patient had a cerebral hemorrhage), while the single patient who received conventional therapy died. For newborns with severe respiratory failure, a prospective, randomized study clearly demonstrated that ECMO improved clinical outcome and is cost-effective compared with conservative therapy.",
