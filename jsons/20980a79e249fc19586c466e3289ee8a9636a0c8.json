T-cell depletion is used to reduce GVHD at certain centers, but is also a major risk factor for HAdV infection in HCT recipients because it is associated with significant immunosuppression during the early post-transplant period.21 Therefore, the use of less intensive T-cell depletion strategies at our center may explain the lower incidence of HAdV viremia, especially during the early post-transplant period.6,20,22 Second, the onset of HAdV infection appeared to be delayed in our study compared to the results of previous studies. Previous studies including recipients who received alemtuzumab-using T-cell depletion or ex vivo T-cell depletion reported that the majority of HAdV infections occurred before day 100 and were associated with high morbidity and mortality.2,3,19,23,24 Feuchtinger et al 2 conducted a prospective study of 21 children and showed that 90% of HAdV infections with viremia occurred within 3 months after HCT. Lion et al 24 also reported that the median onset days of HAdV detection after HCT was 18 days (range, day \u22127 to > day 100). In contrast, seven of 12 HAdV infections (58%) and 3 of 4 HAdV viremia cases (75%) occurred after post-HCT day 100 in our study. The monitoring period should be applied according to the patient's immune status. 7 Therefore, it may be necessary to expand regular HAdV monitoring in patients with delayed immune reconstitution.
