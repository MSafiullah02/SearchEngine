We evaluated a model in which 161 patients could be considered for home immunotherapy self-administration (HITSA) if specific 162 criteria are met. These specific criteria include patients that are advised of the risks and benefits 163 and provide informed consent, do not have a history of prior systemic reactions to 164 immunotherapy (SRIT), lack comorbidities complicating anaphylaxis severity and/or treatment, 165 have high health literacy, and are appropriately educated on storage/handling/administration of 166 AIT (and felt to be able to handle these responsibilities in the opinion of the prescribing 167 clinician).

The cost-effectiveness of HITSA has not been 171 previously explored. This analysis was undertaken to further characterize this approach to 172 providing a valuable core allergy/immunology service when access to in-person encounters may 173 not be feasible or possible, as well as a supplemental model to assess the feasibility of this 174 approach for venom immunotherapy (VIT). 175",

Ongoing VIT was assumed to be completely protective from anaphylaxis, and the risk 337 for anaphylaxis from discontinued immunotherapy assumed to be 50%. Anaphylaxis fatality risk 338 (modeled at 0.29%) was based on a population based epidemiologic study of three national 339 databases published by Ma et. al.(42) , who reported mortality rates of 0.25% to 0.33% for 340 patients hospitalized for anaphylaxis or evaluated in the ED for this diagnosis.

HITSA is highly sensitive to higher wage earners, where home 454 administration mitigates the opportunity cost of time away from their job to receive AIT, and to 455 keeping the cost to administer HITSA low, given a threshold at which in-office administration is 456 favored. There are also a defined range of safety-related concerns contributing to HITSA cost-457 effectiveness. HITSA remains cost-effective vs. in-office administration as long as SRIT fatality 458 risks do not exceed 74-fold greater than the in-clinic risk; however, at a 15% increased HITSA 459 SRIT rate, clinic AIT is the most cost-effective option.

However, we can use examples of several models of homecare where medications 497 of similar potency and potential for significant adverse events are routinely given at home, some 498 daily. A notable example of this is insulin, which is given multiple times a day, and has life-499 threatening potential of harm similar to any form of AIT if given incorrectly. Patients with 500 diabetes are given intensive education to support safe and proper administration at home as 501 routine practice. Provided education is appropriate, there is every reason to think that 12 502 maintenance injections could be handled as such in a pandemic setting, in select patients. To 503 contextualize risk, the estimated rate of AIT fatality per injection, 1.3 x 10 -7 , is on par with the 504 estimated risks of fatal penicillin anaphylaxis (8.0 x10 -8 ) (46), per-patient omalizumab fatality 505 (5.8 x 10 -6 ) ((42, 47, 48) , and the general population risk of home-peanut introduction in US 506 infants (0.3-3 x 10 -7 )(49)(eFigure 4). Penicillin is administered without mandated routine 507 medical observation in the general population, omalizumab is approved for preference-sensitive 508 home administration after the first four uneventful doses in Europe at provider discretion for 509 patients with appropriate indication, and young infants routinely have peanut introduced at 510 home.(46, 50-52) 511",

There will need 540 to be a significant upgrade to nursing support to educate patients, as well as creation of decision-541 support and other tools to help identify ideal patients (including screening for health literacy), 542 but this can be achieved. However, while our model cannot precisely quantify the importance 543 and potential difficulty in selecting such patients, this is critical. Prior to adopting 544 HITSA/HOMVID, it is crucial to develop home protocols to ensure proper administration, 545 appropriate observation, and clear understanding of necessary activity restrictions-a situation 546 not dissimilar to that for oral immunotherapy. Moreover, patients would need to have access to 547 emergency medical services in the event of an SRIT, and an understanding of when these 548 services should be activated. This may pose limitation in some more rural settings. Third, as 549 the potential for a higher rate of incremental discontinuation in the HITSA model increases, the 550 strategy becomes less cost-effective (and it is possible adherence may decrease with home 551 allergen immunotherapy, though this will have to be monitored closely to better understand how 552 this affects adherence).

For venom immunotherapy (VIT), no service disruption, if at all possible, was 154 recommended given the life-threatening nature of Hymenoptera allergy.(1) 155 156 Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is a safe and effective disease modifying treatment for allergic 157 rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma.(11) Due to the potential risk of inducing life-threatening 158 anaphylaxis, it is recommended immunotherapy injections to be administered under medical 159 supervision with a 30-minute post-injection observation period.(11) However, under exceptional 160",

Additional costs of testing and treatment were not 244 individually modeled but assumed not to exceed the $151,860 cost evaluated in the sensitivity 245 analysis. 246 247 Probabilities and Events: 248 All patients experiencing a SRIT received epinephrine, with all HITSA patients transported by 249 ambulance for ED evaluation and management. Patients with a Grade 2-4 SRIT in clinic 250 received ambulance transport and ED evaluation. Philips et. al. reported that 4% out of 773 251 patients receiving subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) experienced a SRIT, with 58% of 252 reactions assessed as Grade 2-4 severity.(24) Anaphylaxis hospitalization rates from Clark et. al. 253 were applied to patients evaluated in the ED for SRIT.(20) 254 255 In a survey of practicing allergists through the AAAAI/ACAAI, Epstein et. al. reported 85% of 256 SRIT occurred within 30 minutes post-injection.(25) The model assumed that all SRITs would 257 be promptly treated with EAI either at home or in clinic; however, sensitivity analyses explored 258 reduced rates of home EAI administration. Epstein et. al. reported 6-7 fatalities from 2008-2016 259 among 54.4 million injections (modeled AIT fatality rate per injection, 1.3 x 10 -7 ).(25) 260 Automobile fatality rates were incorporated based on a rate of 1.18 fatalities per 100 million 261 vehicle miles travelled.(26) 262 263 Estimating AIT adherence is a challenge.(27) A review of SCIT adherence by Cox et. al. 264 reported that rates may range from 6% to 84%.(28) In a retrospective evaluation of SCIT 265 adherence, Hsu et. al. reported a 45% attrition rate over a 4 year period (29). As the base case 266 assumed maintenance immunotherapy, 12 injections were received annually but sensitivity 267 analyses evaluated a broader range of injections in exploratory analyses. Given the 30-minute 268 observation period in addition to parking, clinic check-in, and injection administration, the base 269 case assumed 20 minutes of travel time with 40 minutes of clinic time and a sensitivity analysis 270 incorporated a range from 40 to 90 minutes (travel and clinic time). 271 272 Despite the safety and efficacy of SCIT, patients may experience persistence of symptoms after a 273 course is completed. Symptom relapse rates were extrapolated from patients failing to achieve 274 remission, based on a retrospective review of patients who completed house dust mite AIT by 275 course.(30) 277 278 The model also incorporated the current reality of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic causing 279 widespread COVID-19 infection, applied for the first two years of the simulation to patients 280 receiving AIT or emergency care.(3) While the total duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is 281 unknown, a 24 month time frame was chosen to represent a plausible estimate that a safe and 282 effective vaccine will likely not be available for at least 12-18 months.(31) Population estimates 283 of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary, and rates may exceed 50-60% in some regions and countries(32, 284 33); furthermore, the annual probability of contracting SARS-CoV-2 attributable to visiting an 285 allergy clinic for AIT is unknown. Given this uncertainty, the base case assumed an annual 5% 286 COVID-19 risk attributable to repeated immunotherapy visits during the pandemic, with a wide 287 sensitivity ranging from 0% to 90%. Rates of COVID-19 hospitalization and fatality were based 288 on morbidity and mortality statistics reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 289 (CDC) for the United States between February 12 and March 16, 2020, where fatality risk was 290 greatest in persons > 85 years of age (10%-27%), followed by persons 65-84 years old (3%-291 11%), and with fatality rates of 1%-3% in individuals 55-64 years of age and <1% in persons 20 292 to 54 years old.(34) The model assumed a 0.5% hospitalization fatality rate of COVID-19 in the 293 base case.

As COVID-19 393 associated costs increased, HITSA became more preferred. However, at a 15% increased HITSA 394 SRIT rate, clinic AIT was the most cost-effective strategy. In addition, at equivalent SRIT rates 395 for HITSA and clinic AIT, when the HITSA fatality relative risk was increased 74-fold, clinic 396 AIT was associated with the greatest NMB (WTP, $100,000/QALY) (Figure 3). Clinic AIT was 397 also the preferred strategy when the annual risk of contracting COVID-19 in the allergy clinic 398 fell below 2.4% (eFigure 2). 399 400 Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses 401 From a societal perspective, HITSA was the most cost-effective strategy (WTP $100,000) in 402 83.7% of probabilistic simulations across variable distributions (n=10,000)(Figure 4, eFigure 3). 403 Holding HITSA and clinic AIT SRIT rates constant, HITSA was the optimal strategy in 90.2% 404 of simulations. Considering the healthcare perspective, HITSA was the preferred option in 405 74.3% of simulations.

The cost of 350 HITSA was $16,464, clinic AIT was $16,394, and AIT discontinuation was $18,332, with 351 corresponding effectiveness of each strategy being 22.1077, 22.1061, and 21.9077 (Table 2). 352 Excluding EAI costs, HISTA dominated (e.g., lowest cost, highest degree of benefit) other 353 options, costing $15,210 compared with clinic costs of $16,283. 354 Excluding pandemic considerations, when differential EAI costs were considered, HITSA was 356 not cost effective (ICER $198,877,286) unless annual EAI costs fell below $287. At base case 357 EAI costs without pandemic risks, HITSA cost $16,455 and clinic AIT $16,277, producing 358 22.107785 and 22.107784 QALYs, respectively. Excluding both pandemic risks and risk of 359 motor vehicle accident fatality from round trip clinic transit, clinic AIT dominated other 360 When job-related costs were excluded the ICER of HITSA was $774,125, with HITSA costing 364 $16,352 and clinic AIT costing $15,128. HITSA was not cost-effective from this perspective 365 unless annual EAI cost fell below $21. Excluding pandemic risks, the ICER of HITSA was 366 $1,486,751,997 when job-related costs were excluded, and without job-related costs or pandemic 367 risks considered, HITSA was not cost-effective when EAI costs were excluded (ICER 368",
