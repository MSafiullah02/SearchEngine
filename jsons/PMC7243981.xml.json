Treatment with antibiotics should be reserved for those with clear group A streptococcal infections. This patient\u2019s presentation strongly suggests viral etiology (rhinorrhea, oral ulcers, cough, and no exudates) and thus does not warrant the use of antibiotics. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of corticosteroids for the treatment of moderate to severe pharyngitis. Steroids have been found to provide earlier onset of pain relief as well as shorter duration of symptoms. However, current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines do not advocate for their routine use in the treatment of acute pharyngitis. IDSA guidelines do recommend NSAIDs (strong, high recommendation) as an adjunctive therapy. Rapid antigen detection test should be reserved for patients presenting with clinical features that suggest bacterial group A streptococcal infection.

An abrupt onset is consistent with GABHS pharyngitis. The typical presentation is sore throat, fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, and absence of cough (Centor criteria). It is rare in children <2 years of age and primarily affects children age 5\u201315 years old. It usually occurs in winter and early spring. Comparatively, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and hoarseness are associated with a viral etiology. Lymphadenopathy may be seen in both viral and bacterial pharyngitis.

Patients suspected of having acute otitis media are provided a prescription for oral antibiotics and encouraged to only fill the prescription if the child is not better or becomes worse within 48 hours. The decision to choose observation in lieu of antibiotics should be based upon the age of the patient (typically >2 years), severity of the illness, reliability of caregivers, and the ability for close follow-up.

Cartilage is an avascular tissue and receives nutrients via the skin. Therefore, all exposed cartilage should be covered. Finally, all ear lacerations should be enclosed with a compression dressing to prevent hematoma formation. Many recommend antibiotic prophylaxis including Pseudomonas.
