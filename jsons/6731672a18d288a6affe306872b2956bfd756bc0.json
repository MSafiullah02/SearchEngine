This will likely reduce community transmission of many VPDs. But lockdown will also present a huge challenge for general practitioners (GPs) and community healthcare to deliver immunisations to 2020 birth cohorts, initiate catch-up campaigns with older cohorts and deliver immunisations to at-risk groups. Household isolation and COVID-19 illness in families with new-born children, combined with disruption to vaccine supply, healthcare staffing shortages and enhanced infection prevention procedures, are likely to significantly reduce opportunities for timely delivery of routine immunisations.",

The fall in MMR vaccine coverage has been followed by large outbreaks of measles, with more than 500,000 confirmed cases globally in 2019, more than in any single year since 2006 [3, 4] . While spring and summer 2020 are anticipated to be accompanied by a lower incidence of many VPDs, possible further declines in routine vaccine uptake in 2020 birth cohorts may surpass recent years, and thus generate a record number of susceptible children. If lockdown ends, social distancing relaxes and formal schooling returns before, or during the 2020/21 autumn and winter season, then outbreaks of diseases such as measles, pertussis, and rotavirus gastroenteritis appear inevitable.",

This decision should be informed by evidence from vaccine coverage surveillance, modelling and expert information from GPs and immunisation teams. This will help ensure coverage in infant cohorts has reached a threshold whereby the risk of VPD outbreaks are acceptably low.
