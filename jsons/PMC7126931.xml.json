            "text": "Within this microbial complex, Mycoplasma spp. are found to be ubiquitous in the upper respiratory tract of dogs and are thought to be normal flora (Rosendal, 1982, Randolph et al., 1993). However, mycoplasmas have also been the sole bacterial isolate in a number of clinical cases of canine respiratory disease, but unfortunately these isolates were not speciated and viral causes of CIRD were not investigated (Kirchner et al., 1990, Jameson et al., 1995, Chandler and Lappin, 2002). The involvement of M. cynos in CIRD has been noted for some time (Rosendal, 1972, Rosendal, 1978, Rosendal, 1982). Evidence for this has been mounting recently, as Chalker et al. (2004) found that M. cynos was the only mycoplasma significantly associated with canine respiratory disease. In addition, dogs entering a re-homing kennel that developed an antibody response to M. cynos were more likely to suffer respiratory disease (Rycroft et al., 2007). M. cynos has been isolated from dogs with pneumonia (Rosendal, 1972, Rosendal, 1978, Chvala et al., 2007) and was particularly abundant in the most necrotic areas of the lung (Chvala et al., 2007). Furthermore, M. cynos was the only detected agent in a case of severe bronchopneumonia in a litter of young puppies which resulted in the deaths of some puppies, but which was resolved in the surviving littermates after the administration of appropriate antibiotics (Zeugswetter et al., 2007).",

The dogs had stayed at the kennels for between 8 and 16 days. This may suggest that there is maintenance of M. cynos strains within a kennel situation. M. cynos can be isolated from the upper respiratory tract of healthy dogs (Chalker et al., 2004) and it is probable that some strains are passed between subsequent dogs, resulting in the survival of these strains. In addition, environmental survival may aid the continued existence of some strains. Although the environmental survival of M. cynos is not known, the environmental survival of other mycoplasma species varies from a week to several months (Nagatomo et al., 2001) and M. cynos can be isolated from the air (Chalker et al., 2004). Recently it has been shown that biofilm formation is important for persistence of mycoplasmas and may aid environmental survival (McAuliffe et al., 2006), it seems feasible that M. cynos may be able to persist in the kennel environment as an adherent biofilm layer.",

The high degree of similarity of the type strain to these United Kingdom isolates from 1999 to 2000 suggests a low level of diversity of this organism in CIRD. However, this study also shows that some isolates have a relatively low level of similarity with each other (for example isolates 214, 491 and 492 appear to be dissimilar to the group 1 isolates). Indeed, this study suggests the potential for mixed M. cynos infections, as the same bronchoalveolar lavage sample from dog B-2 yielded M. cynos isolates 492 and 510, which are dissimilar strains. Similarly, the BAL sample from dog A-1 resulted in the culture of the 214 isolate which was dissimilar to the other isolates from this sample.
