Story of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a prime example of widespread 'herd mentality'. Since doctors (and even patients) are well conversant with these drugs in India, having used it in tropical diseases like malaria, amoebiasis etc., it was 'easy for them to believe' regarding its 'magical effects'. When first reports of 'efficacy' of these compounds came in, we were inundated with the queries mostly for the prophylaxis rather than treatment of COVID-19, despite no evidence of its benefit. At this time, even apex scientific research agency of India, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), hurriedly issued guideline for prophylaxis of COVID-19, thus clearing use of HCQ in high risk contacts [1] . Interestingly, no other health agency globally has given such directive till date.",

This 'herd mentality' of taking HCQ as 'prophylactic drug' was seen far and wide amongst physician community as well, although most of them were not in contact with any COVID-19 patient. As a result, patients who genuinely needed HCQ (e.g. for rheumatoid arthritis) could not get it [2] . Concerns regarding lack of evidence of CQ or HCQ in human trials for mass prophylaxis for COVID 19 was expressed by only a few [3, 4] .",

Mass gatherings continued during lockdown (e.g. herds of migrants returning to their native places from cities, herd of people gathering in religious assemblies, in meetings of 'super spreader' preachers [5] and clustering at marriage ceremonies) despite major spread of COVID-19 have been witnessed in other countries following such events.",
