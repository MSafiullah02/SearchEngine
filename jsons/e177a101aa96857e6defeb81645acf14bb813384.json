Infection rate in critically ill patients are about 40% and may be 50-60% in those remaining in the intensive care unit (ICU) for more then 5 days. 1,2 Pneumonia acquired in the ICU (after 48 h intubation) ranges from 10% to 65%, 3,4 and respiratory infections account for 30-60% of all infections acquired in the ICU. 5,6 Mortality rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have been very high (30-70%) and may account for 15% of all deaths in the ICU. 7-9 When controlled for severity of underlying disease and other factors the attributable mortality of VAP range from 0% to 50% absolute increase, and prolonged length of ICU stay (range 5-13 days). 10 In a recent review of the clinical and economic consequences of VAP from analysis of studies published after 1990, the findings were: 10-20% of ICU-ventilated patients will develop VAP, and are twice as likely to die compared to patients without VAP, with 6 extra days in the ICU and an additional US$10019 hospital cost per case. 11 Empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials in the ICU for presumed pneumonia has contributed substantially to the worldwide increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals. This has compounded the problem of increasing morbidity, mortality, and cost because of the challenge posed by these difficult-to-treat microorganisms, particularly the use of expensive drugs and need for isolation. This chapter will address emerging issues in VAP such as diagnosis, appropriate management, and prevention.",

The standard clinical criteria such as new or progressive infiltrates on chest radiographs, together with fever, leukocytosis or leucopenia, and purulent tracheobronchial secretion are of limited diagnostic accuracy. In studies using histologic analysis and culture of lung samples immediately after death for confirmation of the diagnosis, the presence of new or progressing chest infiltrate with two of three clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 75% for the diagnosis of VAP. 12 This is quite understandable considering that there are several common causes of pulmonary infiltrates in critically ill patients (i.e., pulmonary edema, ARDS, atelectasis, and pulmonary hemorrhage) that can mimic pneumonia; and many intubated patients have tracheobronchitis with purulent respiratory secretions, and may develop fever and leucocytosis from a number of sources (such as urinary tract infection, venous, or arterial catheter infections, Clostridium difficile colitis, drugs, blood products, etc.).",

Although analysis of qualitative culture of tracheobronchial secretion is helpful in identification of the underlying pathogen, it is not specific for the diagnosis of VAP. A common abuse and overuse of antibiotics that we have observed in the ICU by physicians is treatment of potential pathogens from purulent respiratory secretions (tracheobronchitis), with no evidence of pneumonia (personal observation). There is no evidence that antibiotics in these situations are of value and treatment of tracheobronchitis in the ICU is not justified. On the other hand prompt and appropriate treatment of VAP is beneficial and may have a major impact on mortality and morbidity. Although appropriate antibiotics may improve survival in VAP, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics without clinical infection is potentially harmful, increasing the risk for colonization and superinfection with multiresistant bacteria, fungi (candidiasis), C. difficile colitis, and potential adverse events. Numerous studies have documented the increase in multiresistant gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive bacteria in hospital-acquired infection worldwide, 5, 15 and the ICU have been deemed ''factories for creating, disseminating and amplifying resistance to antibiotics.'' 16 The presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing coliforms (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Serratia marcescens, etc.) have become common isolates in many tertiary ICUs. 16 In the United States data from the National Nosomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) System from 2003 found that S. aureas was the most common pathogen in VAP (27.8%), followed by P. aeruginosa (18.1%), Enterobacter species (10%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.2%), and Acinetobacter species (6.9%). 17 50 3 Current Issues in Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia",

An International Consensus Conference in 1992 had recommended !10 4 CFU/ml as the best threshold. 21 To overcome the problem of contamination present in the proximal airways, use of a protected transbronchoscopic balloon-tipped catheter to obtain BAL for quantitative culture has been used. One study of 13 patients with pneumonia and 33 controls, with a threshold of 10 4 CFU/ml, yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 92%. 22 Samples obtained by the protected BAL can also be examined directly by Giemsa stain or the gram stain immediately after the procedure to enable intervention with antimicrobial therapy before obtaining culture results. Several studies found that if the Giemsa or gram stain was positive, where >3% or 5% BAL cells contained intracellular bacteria, this correlated with most patients with pneumonia and negative for patients without pneumonia. 13, 23, 24 Furthermore, the morphological findings on the stained specimens closely correlated with the bacterial cultures.",

But the PSB by itself has been extensively studied for quantitative cultures (using a special double-catheter brush system with a distal occluding plug to reduce contamination). The PSB is done with a fiberoptic bronchoscope, with cutoff threshold set at 10 3 CFU. Since 3.2 Issues in the Diagnosis of VAP 51 0.01-0.001 ml of secretion is collected with PSB technique, >10 3 CFU of bacteria represents 10 5 -10 6 CFU/ml of secretion. Comparison of quantitative BAL and PSB microbiological findings has been noted to have high correlation. In one study 25 the quantitative agreement was 83% of the organisms isolated, and the qualitative results were significantly correlated (rho = 0.46, p < 0.0001). Numerous studies have been done in patients with VAP to assess quantitative BAL and PSB. Most of these studies were limited by small sample size and use of clinical or microbiological criteria as the ''gold standard'' for diagnosis. In studies evaluating both techniques a meta-analysis of 11 studies in 435 ICU patients found the overall accuracy BAL to be close to that of PSB. 26 Blind-protected telescoping catheter (PTC) (or blind-protected brush PTB) without bronchoscopy has been compared to quantitative BAL via bronchoscope to diagnose VAP. Although blind PTC and PTB specimens have been reported to show very good correlation with BAL in some studies, 27, 28, 29 provided the sample containing visible secretions expelled from the catheter and both lungs are sampled, other studies showed low concordance between blind and directed PSB samples (53%). 30 Although there are numerous studies assessing quantitative cultures of various respiratory samples (EA, BAL, blind, and directed PSB or PTC) for diagnosis of VAP they have several shortcomings. Most of the studies involved small sample size with pneumonia; there were frequent flaws and design-related biases, 31 and most important, the ''gold standard'' for diagnosis of VAP used is controversial and not well-established. The ''gold standard'' for diagnosis of VAP in several studies included autopsy or histopathology and cultures from open or percutaneous biopsies of lungs immediately after death. The correlation of the various sampling techniques with histology and biopsy culture results is summarized in Table 3 .1. Eleven studies performed between 1984 and 2001, were reviewed, 12,32-41 involving 378 subjects from the ICU with 209 (55%) with confirmed VAP. Seventy-two percent of the cases received antibiotics within 48 h of the postmortem studies, thus potentially affecting the accuracy of quantitative cultures in the majority of studies. The sensitivity of quantitative PSB ranged from 15% to 100% (mean 54.6%) and the specificity ranged from 50% to 100% (mean 74.6%), similar to the results of BAL (bronchoscopic and mini-BAL combined) with mean sensitivity and specificity of 51.3% and 79.8%, respectively. Unfortunately only five of the studies assessed the clinical criteria for pneumonia compared to the gold standard, and the mean sensitivity was 81% (range 69-100%) and the mean specificity 62.8% (range 42-85%). Thus, the clinical criteria for pneumonia were not inferior to more invasive investigations and may be somewhat more sensitive. However, it is very likely that prior antibiotics treatment before the quantitative cultures (within 48 h) was responsible for the low sensitivity of these techniques.",

The diagnosis of VAP was still defined as the presence of new, persistent pulmonary infiltrates not otherwise explained, appearing on chest radiograph (not present before intubation); and the presence of at least two of the following criteria: (1) temperature >38 C, (2) leukocytosis >10,000 cells/mm 3 , and (3) purulent respiratory secretions. 44 A recent multicenter randomized trial of 740 patients in 28 ICUs in Canada and the United States have confirmed these opinions. 46 There were no differences in outcome and overall use of antibiotics when two diagnostic strategies for VAP were compared, BAL with quantitative culture and EA with nonquantitative culture. 46 ",

Most studies of VAP, however, find a predominance of gram-negative bacilli and staphylococci that normally colonize the oropharynx and gut. The most common pathogens include S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter species, and S. marcescens, but the relative frequency will vary from center to center. In early-onset VAP, soon after admission and <7 days on mechanical ventilation, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and more susceptible gram-negative bacilli, maybe the etiological agents. 44 Polymicrobial infections with mixed bacteria have also been reported in up to 48% of all cases of VAP. 57 The importance of anaerobes is unknown due to inadequate studies and is likely underestimated. The rates of isolation of anaerobes in VAP have been low in most studies (1-3.5%), 44 but has been higher (23%) in one study. 58 This suggests that other studies may be using inadequate techniques for obtaining (oxygen administration), transporting, and culturing respiratory secretions for anaerobes. Atypical bacteria (Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae, viruses (i.e., respiratory syncytial virus), and fungi have also been implicated at times, but these pathogens have not been studied systematically and their role is presently unclear. 58 The method of obtaining specimen to confirm the etiology has been contentious, with, advocates of deep endotracheal aspirates citing simplicity, easy to perform by any ICU nurses, versus advocates of more invasive bronchoscopy techniques. 56 However, recent studies have found similarities in obtaining clinically significant pathogens from four procedures used (blind endotracheal aspiration, PSB, bronchoscopic BAL, or directed brushings). 59, 60 Although, initial prospective studies showed improved outcomes (mortality) with invasive versus noninvasive diagnostic management for suspected VAP, 61,62 more recent studies have not. 63, 64 In the most recent review and meta-analysis of this topic it was concluded that the invasive strategies do not alter mortality in VAP, but affect antibiotic use and prescribing. 65, 66 Although most investigators favored a more invasive approach, 44 others recommended initial endotracheal aspiration for diagnosis, and reserve invasive methods for patients not responding to initial empirical antibiotic treatment. 64, 67 The latter course is reasonable and may allow more rapid intervention, as a precise bacteriologic diagnosis is of paramount importance for therapeutic success and cultures should be obtained before initiating therapy. Other areas where initial invasive diagnostic procedures are warranted include immunocompromised hosts (i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]), and BAL samples should be sent for viral studies, mycobacterial and fungal smears and cultures, cytology, and stain for Pneumocystis carinii.",

The results of cultures should not delay starting empirical therapy, usually a broad-spectrum agent (or combination) to cover S. aureus and gram-negative bacilli. There is some data to indicate that starting therapy early in VAP lowers the mortality (trend) than delaying therapy for >48 h after the diagnosis was considered. 67,68 Treatment may be guided by gram stain of respiratory samples to assist in choice of antimicrobial agents, as the overall accuracy in diagnosing VAP for any organism was 88% in one retrospective study. 69 A combination of gram stain and bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay have also been used for rapid diagnosis of BAL samples, with sensitivity of 95.3%, specificity of 54.9%, and negative predictive value of 97.6%. 70 Thus a negative result may allow use of narrow spectrum antimicrobial agents or withholding empiric therapy for suspected VAP. 70 Assaying for endotoxin from BAL samples have also been used to diagnose gram-negative bacterial VAP as a rapid test, but this is not generally available in most centers and appears to provide the same accuracy as a gram stain (which is cheaper and easier to perform in any clinical laboratory). 71 There is no consensus as to the initial empiric therapy for VAP, as this should depend on the individual center's experience with the prevalence and pattern of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Factors that should be taken into consideration in selecting an antibiotic include onset of pneumonia after ventilation, duration of hospitalization, previous antimicrobial therapy, and underlying disease. Early onset of VAP (<7 days of ventilation) in patients not previously treated with antibiotics may be due to more sensitive bacteria, such as in S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and enteric gram-negative bacilli. In this situation it is recommended to use a single agent that has no anti-pseudomonal activity such as ampicillin-sulbactam, -ceftriaxone, or -cefotaxime, newer fluoroquinolones, or ertapenem. 44 In cases of VAP occurring >7 days after ventilation, or previously treated with antibiotics or hospitalized for prolonged periods, more resistant bacteria may be responsible for pneumonia such as MRSA, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and multiresistant organisms. However, it would appear that the duration of ventilation before development of pneumonia is less important than the duration of hospitalization and previous antibiotic therapy in predisposing to Pseudomonas or more resistant bacterial infection. 72 Initial therapy under these circumstances may include a broad-spectrum coverage (such as imipenem or meropenem, piperacillintazobacterum, or combination of agents) to cover the most prevalent bacteria circulating in the ICU. Empiric therapy for MRSA is usually not necessary unless the patient is known to be colonized or in close contact with a subject with MRSA, and the respiratory sample shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. In a consensus conference most investigators preferred to use a combination of an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone with an anti-pseudomonal, extended-spectrum b-lactam or a carbapenem plus an aminoglycoside in late onset VAP, until cultures and susceptibility are available, but there are no clinical trials available to support these guidelines. 44 Intuitively it seems rational that selection of an antimicrobial regimen should be effective against recent pathogens that colonize the patient's respiratory tract. However, serial routine microbial cultures result in the initial management of VAP has been found to be of limited value. 73 Does P. aeruginosa pneumonia require a combination therapy? It has been standard practice in many centers and recommendation by most investigators to use a combination of anti-pseudomonal, extended-spectrum b-lactam with an aminoglycoside or with a fluoroquinolone (i.e., ciprofloxacin) for P. aeruginosa pneumonia. 74 However, the concept that dual therapy is superior to monotherapy or less likely to develop antibacterial resistance is unproven. Despite this, since P. aeruginosa pneumonia carries a poor prognosis with mortality rate that exceeds 40% 8 and the variable resistance pattern to extended-spectrum b-lactam agents and ciprofloxacin (which is increasing in many centers) 75 it is a reasonable recommendation to use a combination of two agents.",

            "text": "The most common advocated practice for VAP is to maximize empirical antimicrobial coverage with subsequent streamlining of therapy once culture and sensitivity data are available. 76, 77 This appears to be a successful strategy but studies using historical controls may suffer from significant bias. It has been suggested that computer-assisted antibiotic prescription in ICUs may supplement or replace such strategies in the future. 76 Duration of therapy for VAP was often variable and empirical with a tendency for overtreatment. A recent randomized multicenter study of 402 patients with VAP showed no difference in outcome between 8-day versus 15-day course of antibiotic therapy and the recurrence rate was similar (28.9% and 26.0%), except P. aeruginosa was associated with higher recurrence in the shorter course group (40.6% vs 25.4%). 78 Thus shorter course of therapy may lead to less antibiotic exposure and possible help reduce antimicrobial resistance in the ICU. Another approach to limit antibiotic overuse in the ICU for low-risk patients with pulmonary infiltrates with suspected pneumonia is to initiate monotherapy then stop antibiotic therapy at 3 days for those with a CPIS < 6. 79 In this randomized, unblinded, controlled study of 81 patients, the outcome was similar but patients receiving earlier discontinuation of antibiotics had lower incidence of antimicrobial resistance or superinfection, and lower mean antibiotic costs. 79 In the past when less active anti-pseudomonal b-lactam (carbenicillin) was available and aminoglycosides were used by multiple dosing, there was concern about inadequate endobronchial concentration of aminoglycoside for severe Pseudomonas or gram-negative pneumonia. Interest was generated by a few studies to administer the aminoglycoside endobronchially via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy to complement combined systemic therapy. In a double-blind randomized study of gram-negative VAP, all patients received systemic tobramycin plus piperacillin or cefazolin and half the patients were randomized to receive 40 mg tobramycin every 8 h or placebo instilled enotracheally. 80 P. aeruginosa was the main pathogen in 41% of 41 assessable cases. Although the causative pathogens were eradicated from respiratory tract more frequently in those receiving endotracheal tobramycin, there was no difference in the clinical outcome of the two groups. 80 In a more recent study of 38 VAP patients with a similar design half the patients were randomized to receive either additional nebulized tobramycin (6 mg/kg/day) or placebo, once daily for 5 days. 81 Extubation by day 10 was achieved in 35% of patients receiving nebulized tobramycin and 18.5% of those in the placebo group but the difference was not statistically significant.",

Obviously this would be worthwhile as it should save lives, reduce mortality, decrease duration of ventilation and hospitalization, and reduce costs. It would appear evident that the best way to prevent VAP is to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation but this is not feasible in most instances. There has been much interest in the use of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) to prevent intubation and manage patients with respiratory failure. In a recent review and meta-analysis of 12 studies, NPPV showed a strong benefit in reducing pneumonia compared to standard ventilation (relative risk 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.57, p = 0.0002). 84 However, the strongest evidence to support use of NPPV in patients with acute respiratory failure is in patients with exacerbation of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 85 Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary contusion have also been found to require lower intubation rates, whereas patients with a higher severity score, an older age, ARDS or pneumonia, or fail to improve after 1 h of treatment, the risk of failure with NPPV is higher. 86 Thus in hypoxic acute respiratory failure management with NPPV can be successful in selected patients.",

            "text": "Rotational beds, prone position and semi-recumbent position have been proposed and investigated as simple measures to prevent VAP. These measures as preventative techniques have recently been reviewed by Hess. 87 Rotational therapy uses a special kinetic bed designed to turn continuously, or nearly continuously, the patient from side to side. A meta-analysis of studies evaluating the effect of rotational bed therapy shows a decrease in risk of pneumonia but no effect on mortality. 88 Considering increased cost of these kinetic beds ($200/day), potential for an advertent disconnection of intravenous catheters, they are not routinely recommended but may be useful in select patients with neurologic problems or surgical patients. 88 Prone positioning has been shown to increase alveolar oxygenation (PaO 2 ) in patients with ARDS and lung injury but no survival benefit. 87 Two randomized studies on prone positioning (4-8 h/day) compared to supine position has been performed. One small study showed reduction in VAP (not statistically significant), and a larger study in 21 ICUs found just significant lower VAP with prone positioning (20.6% vs 24.1%) but no improvement in mortality in both studies. 89, 90 Thus prone positioning is not recommended as technical considerations preclude its use and it is associated with increased complications such as pressure ulcers and obstruction of the endotracheal tube. 89 Studies have shown that radiolabeled enteral feeding in mechanically ventilated patients are more likely to be aspirated in the supine position compared to the semirecumbent position (head elevated at a 45 degree angle). 87 One randomized study have found that semi-recumbent position was associated with lower VAP compared to the supine position (RRO.22, 95%, CI 0.05-0.92, p = 0.04). 91 Since semirecumbent positioning is a low-cost, low-risk approach to preventing VAP it has been recommended for routine positioning in the ICU by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 92 and the Canadian Critical Care Society, 10 despite the fact that mortality was not improved in the randomized study. 89 However, in a more recent randomized, prospective study 109 patients were assigned supine position (with backrest elevation of 10 degrees), and 112 to the semi-recumbent position (target backrest elevation of 45 degrees) was not achieved 85% of the study time. The achieved difference in the treatment position (28 degrees vs 10 degrees) did not prevent the development of VAP. 93 In a small pilot study 35 patients on mechanical ventilation received continuous lateral rotational therapy (CLRT) for 5 days, compared to 35 control patients matched for age, gender, cause of respiratory failure, admission APACHE score, received routine positional change. 94 The patients receiving CLRT had improved oxygenation and reduced incidence of VAP compared to controls. Thus a large, randomized, prospective study is warranted to confirm this observation. In another small study 60 ventilated patients were randomized to receive chest physiotherapy or sham physiotherapy, VAP occurred in 39% of the controls and 8% of the treated group, p = 0.02. 95 However, there were no differences in duration of stay or ICU mortality. It is surprising that larger randomized control trials have not been reported since this report in 2002 to confirm these results.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have been published on antibiotic prophylaxis or SDD to prevent VAP in the past two decades. In the most recent Cochrane Review of 36 trials involving 6,922 patients, 17 trials (N = 4,295 patients) tested a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics, the average rate of respiratory tract infections and mortality in the control group were 36% and 29%, respectively. 97 There was a significant reduction of both VAP (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.29-0.41) and mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.89) and on average required 5 patients to be treated to prevent one VAP, and 21 patients to prevent one death. In 17 trials (N \u00bc 2,664) that tested topical antimicrobial alone, there was a significant reduction in VAP (OR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.43-0.63) but not in total mortality in the treated group. 97 However, only one of the trials explored the consequences of antibiotic resistance and superinfection as a result of prophylaxis. With accumulating evidence of increasing antimicrobial resistance in the ICU, and evidence that SDD promotes gram-positive bacterial infections, most guidelines do not recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis in the ICU. 10, 92, [97] [98] [99] [100] Efforts to reduce heavy colonization of oropharyngeal bacteria by improving oral hygiene and use of topical antiseptics have received little attention in the scientific literature as a means of prevention of VAP. Oral hygiene is compromised in ICU patients by the presence of intubations tube, nasogastric catheter, heavy sedation, anticholinergic drugs, and mouth breathing all impair salivation and normal swallowing mechanism and allow bacterial overgrowth. Unfortunately, little is known about the efforts of oral care interventions in ICU patients on mechanical ventilation and development of VAP. 101 Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent (bactericidal for both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria), that is not absorbed through mucosa or skin, and is the recommended antiseptic of choice for preoperative preparations. It is also available as an oral rinse to prevent and treat gingivitis. An advantage of chlorhexidine is the absence of any significant bacterial resistance and good safety profile when used topically. Two previous randomized, placebo-controlled studies were performed before intubating and continued therapy throughout the ICU stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. 102, 103 Both studies showed a reduction in nosocomial pneumonia, but was significant only for one study, 102 and for a subgroup of those at highest risk of pneumonia in the other. 103 In a prospective, nonrandomized, controlled study in a surgical ICU patient's intubated for mechanical ventilation for the 5 months were given standard care with ventilator weaning protocol (controls). 104 During the following 5 months 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse was added twice daily to all intubated patients (N \u00bc 95 for both groups). The addition of chlorhexidine led to a significant reduction and delay in the occurrence of VAP (37% overall, 75% for late VAP, p < 0.05). The median duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the ICU or hospital, between the groups were no different. 104 This type of design, however, may lead to biases that could influence results.",

Thus sucralfate has been recommended for stress ulcer prophylaxis in patients with low to moderate risk for gastrointestinal bleeding (absence of bleeding tendency or need for prolong mechanical ventilation). 10, 92 In patients at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding H2 antagonists or a proton pump inhibitor are preferred for stress ulcer prophylaxis. In these circumstances other methods to reduce gastric enteric bacterial overgrowth are needed. A recent pilot study has examined the benefit of acidifying feeding formula using potassium sorbate to reduce bacterial burden. 106 Sixteen patients on mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive acidified formula (PH 4.25) and 14 controls received standard formula. The number of organisms isolated in each patient per week and the quantity of bacteria (colony forming units/ml) of gastric aspirates were significantly higher in the controls. 106 There was no difference in gastrointestinal bleeding between the two groups. Thus large, randomized clinical trials to assess prevention of VAP and bleeding risk in patients requiring H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitor are warranted with this acidified feeding formula. A previous randomized study of acidified feeding formula used hydrochloric acid added to the formula in critically ill patients, all on sucralfate with 120 enrolled but 95 analyzed with primary outcome measure being bacterial colonization of gastric contents, and secondary outcome VAP. 107 Bacterial colonization was significantly less in the acidified treatment group 2% versus 43%; VAP was less than half in the acid feeds (6.1%) versus control group (15%) but sample size was too small to show any significant difference.",

Thus subglottic secretion appears effective in preventing early-onset VAP in patients requiring mechanical ventilation for >3 days. Although no beneficial effect on mortality was reported, it would be cost-effective even though the specialized endotracheal tubes cost about 25% more than standard endotracheal tubes, and there is no significant harm reported with this technique. This method for prevention of VAP has been recommended by the CDC and other guidelines. 10, 89, 92 Few other methods to reduce oropharyngeal or gastric content aspiration have been examined in randomized studies. One approach is to use gel lubrication of the tracheal tube cuff to reduce pulmonary aspiration. In a small pilot study of 36 anesthetized patients and 9 ICU patients with tracheostomies, lubricated cuffs were compared to non-lubricated cuffs leakage of dye placed in the subglottic space 109 . Dye leakage was 11% in the lubrication group and 83% in the non-lubrication group of anesthetized patients, p < 0.001. In the ICU patients with lubricated cuff tracheostomy tubes leakage first occurred after a mean of 48 h (range 24-120 h). Thus for patients with prolonged intubation/ventilation changing or reinserting the tube with fresh lubrication every 48 h would be a practical limitation.",
