COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are higher among older individuals.2 However, no breakdown of recovery periods is available for different patient age groups in large population cohorts. Such knowledge may improve our understanding of COVID-19 and assist healthcare system readiness for future coronavirus epidemics or pandemics. Our study aimed at assessing the effects of age and sex of Israeli COVID-19 patients on their rate of recovery, applying datamining of a large dataset of 5,769 recovered Israeli patients released to the public on April 28, 2020 by the Israel Ministry of Health.",

Age groups are shown in this public dataset according to decades for the age range of 20 to 59 years, while for younger or older patients age groups are assigned as 0-19 years or as over 60 years. Recovery is defined by two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 throat swab test results. Time from infection to recovery is measured as number of days from first positive to first negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result. Statistical significance of differences in the recovery times between patient groups were compared using two-way ANOVA as described in the Figure and Table legends.

Yet, it seems reasonable to assume that the heavy workload during this period did not affect the observed between group differences, so that the recorded times between the first positive to first negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results may serve as proxy of time to recovery. In favor of this, all SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in Israel (at time of writing this report) is done by the same RNA extraction and PCR specifications as coordinated by the Israel Ministry of Health COVID-19 emergency team.",
