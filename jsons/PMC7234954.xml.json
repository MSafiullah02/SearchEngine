The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Association (SAMHSA) has defined trauma as resulting from \u201can event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual\u2019s functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being.\u201d\n3 Recent reports of healthcare workers\u2019 experiences during COVID-19 have revealed significant psychological distress related to providing care during the pandemic.4 Particularly in humanitarian crises, vicarious trauma experienced by healthcare workers may result from observing suffering, caring for those dying alone, and triaging limited resources. Additional sources of psychological distress and threat to wellbeing for patients, caregivers, and providers may include isolation, illness stigmatization, and concern for spreading the threat of COVID-19 to others.4 Following the immediate damage of COVID- 19, we expect an increasing wave of trauma response from patients, caregivers, and providers alike.4 (Figure 1\n).",
