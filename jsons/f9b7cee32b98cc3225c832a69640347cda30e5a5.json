Besides SARS, there are many kinds of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, cholera, and infl uenza, that challenge our vulnerable world frequently. According to data from World Health Organization (WHO), about 1 billion people worldwide are affected by one or more infectious diseases. Each year, almost 9 million people are killed, many of whom are children under fi ve; furthermore, some infectious diseases cause life-long disability. [ 2 ] The situation is serious for developed and developing countries alike. In addition to naturally occurring diseases, biothreats and biochemical warfare agents also pose a threat, [ 3 ] as exemplifi ed by the anthrax spores attacks through the US mail system in 2001. Unfortunately, our knowledge of infectious diseases is still inadequate in terms of fully predicting and controlling epidemic events. One of the important factors hampering the control of infectious disease is a lack of effective diagnosis; in order to stop the infectious diseases and biothreats before they spread, it is of critical important to develop diagnostic tests that are fast, cheap, miniaturized, accurate, and suitable for the direct use in developing countries, remote areas, and for global surveillance. [ 4 ] In the past decades, much progress has been made to address this problem; most serious epidemics have been contained through global alerts and cooperation.",

[ 7 ] This creative method is quite generalizable to any other DNA or RNA sequence. Then, Storhoff's group expanded this method to the detection of unamplifi ed mecA in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; the fi rst outbreaks of infection occurred in Europe in early 1960s, and it has since spread worldwide) [ 8 ] genomic DNA samples. [ 9 ] Just like Mirkin's colorimetric assay, two types of DNA probes were immobilized on gold nanoparticles and used to hybridize to adjacent regions on the mecA sequence. In the presence of mecA target, a red-to-purple color change was observed because of the target-induced aggregation of gold nanoparticles. This result confi rmed that this method is selective enough to identify the specifi c target in the presence of total genomic DNA isolated from MRSA. While, as a negative control, the total genomic DNA from methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strains did not bring any color change. An impressive detection limit was obtained and as few as 20 000 targets could be detected specifi cally in total bacterial genomic DNA without any signal amplifi cation. Lai's group developed a similar method to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and MTB complex (MTBC). Impressively, they collected 600 clinic sputum specimens and detected the relative DNA targets. Through comparing the results to the traditional culture and biomedical methods, their assay showed a 96.6% sensitivity and 98.9% specifi city towards detection of MTBC, and a 94.7% sensitivity and 99.6% specifi city for detection of MTB. [ 10 ] After developing the gold nanoparticle-based assay for tuberculosis, Baptista et al. estimated the overall cost was less than $0.35 per sample, which is much cheaper than for other molecular methods. [ 11 ] Importantly, this strategy can be further developed and integrated with some other emerging technologies. As a successful integration, Chan et al. combined DNAzyme amplifi cation with colorimetric coupling of surface plasmons of gold nanoparticles for point-of-care detection of infectious diseases. [ 12 ] This method is based on a catalytic DNAzyme which is much cheaper and more stable than its protein counterparts. Furthermore, the simple colorimetric readout ensures this method is instrument-free. As shown in Figure 2 , without the genetic target, the DNAzyme is disassembled into two parts (A and B) and has no cleavage activity on its substrate DNA strands (linker DNA); then, the gold nanoparticles conjugated with complementary strands to linker DNA can be bridged together and form aggregates, so the color turns blue. If the target is present, the components of DNAzyme assemble together and catalyze the cleavage of multiple linker DNAs; then, the gold nanoparticles disperse well because of the absence of the linker DNAs, so the color remains red. By rational design of the recognition arms and linker DNA, this method can be easily generalized to other DNA targets. They detected multiple DNA targets for infectious diseases (gonorrhea, syphilis bacteria, malaria parasite, and hepatitis B virus) in a multiplexed manner. This method inherently requires no complex equipment, expensive reagents, or complicated operations, making it suitable for point-of-care diagnosis.",

They pointed out the limitations of traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for HCV detection, which include false-negative results in early stage and for immunosuppressed patients. First, singlestranded RNA probes with fl exible backbones were incubated with gold nanoparticles and adsorbed on the surface of gold nanoparticles, which can protect gold nanoparticles from aggregation. Then, HCV RNA targets were added into the solution. The hybridized double helices of target RNA and probes are relatively rigid and expose their negatively charged phosphate backbone to the gold nanoparticles. Thus, the double helices were separated from the gold nanoparticles due to electrostatic repulsion. As a result, the aggregation of gold nanoparticles and a color change were observed. [ 14 ] A similar mechanism was later used by the same group to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); however this time they used gold nanorods instead and achieved a detection limit of 100 p M . [ 15 ] Most recently, a direct and rapid detection of MTB was developed using unmodifi ed gold nanoparticles to detect unamplifi ed genomic DNA extracted from MTB clinical samples. [ 16 ] This method can eliminate the PCR amplifi cation steps and reduce the turnaround time effectively. It was found that genomic DNA is diffi cult to denature because of its high G-C rate. Some physical methods, such as vortexing with glass beads and passing it through a fi ne syringe needle, did not work; an effective method was to use an enzyme ( Bam HI ) to digest the genomic DNA, which fi nally allowed detect of amounts of genomic DNA as low as 40 ng without any amplifi cation.",

The combination of double-antibody sandwich assay and gold nanoparticles provides a versatile platform for sensitive detection of antigens. Usually the antibodies are physically adsorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles without losing their binding activity. Sia and co-workers demonstrated a useful and reliable diagnostic device based on antibody-gold nanoparticle conjugates [ 21 ] ( Figure 3 ). First, they immobilized the capture antibodies on a biochip. Then, HIV antigen, the antibody-gold nanoparticle conjugates, silver reagents, and washing buffer were delivered serially through a microfl uidic device. The silver solution was used as signal amplifi cation (silver reduction produces amplifi ed signal on gold nanoparticles). Thus, an assay was completed within 20 min. Impressively, they pointed out that many technologies work well in laboratory but not in the fi eld. To further prove the success of their detection, they tested their device in Rwanda (the HIV prevalence is about 3% nationally and even higher -8% -in some areas such as Kigali). A small volume of unprocessed whole blood (less than 1 \u03bc L) from patient was used and 70 specimens were collected. They obtained sensitivity of 100% and specifi city of 96%. Other than this, they tried to test the HIV in 101 archived specimens, many of which were also infected by hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or both. They obtained a high sensitivity of 100% and specifi city of 94%. These results showed the excellent accuracy of their detection in complicated samples with different infection statuses. The antibody-gold nanoparticle conjugates are widely used for signal amplifi cation in some other infectious factors and diseases, [ 22 ] such as HIV type 1 in plasma, [ 23 ] avian infl uenza virus, [ 24 ] and respiratory infection.

Sabo-attwood double-antibody sandwich complex formed, a single target protein binding can bring a gold nanoparticle conjugated with antibodies and DNAs. Then, by quantifying the large amount of DNA released from the gold nanoparticle, highly sensitive protein detection was achieved with detection limit of 30 a M concentration. Thus, a protein binding event can be transferred to the detection of a large number of DNA sequences. Based on the original mode, they further applied it to the sensitive detection of HIV-1 p24 Gag protein. [ 28 ] They found that commonly used methods, such as ELISA, are specifi c but not sensitive enough for the earliest stage of HIV infection: of 112 HIV-positive plasma specimens, only 23 specimens were identifi ed by ELISA, while using the nanoparticle based bio-barcode method, 111 specimens were detected as HIV positive. A total of 34 uninfected specimens were not identifi ed by both approaches. As a result, the specifi city of the nanoparticle based bio-barcode was 100% and the sensitivity was 99%.",

In the traditional sandwich assay, one DNA target can only hybridize one signaling probe, which brings a relatively weak signal from one signaling molecule (fl uorophore or other signaling group). On the other hand, using DNA-gold nanoparticle conjugates, one hybridization event can bring an amplifi ed signal from thousands of DNA sequences conjugated on the gold nanoparticles. Mirkin's group obtained a detection sensitivity of 500 z M using this method. [ 20a , 29 ] A similar method was used to selectively detect mecA and tuf genes in the purifi ed genomic DNA of MRSA; a success rate of 100% was obtained, comparing results with those from bacterial culturing. [ 20d ] [ 30 ] Synthetic carbohydrate and protein interaction is widely used in biorecognition, but the binding affi nity is relatively weak ( k a is 10 3 -10 4 M \u2212 1 ). [ 30a ] To improve this, Lin and co-workers assembled globotriose (p k ) on the surface of gold nanoparticles through Au-S bonding to interrogate the multivalent interaction of p kgold nanoparticle conjugates and B 5 subunit of Shiga-like toxin (B-Slt). By doing so, the binding affi nity was improved greatly and presented a ca. 10 8 -fold increase compared to the monovalent p k ligand. Basd on this, they developed a robust sandwich assay for the B-Slt and obtained a detection limit of 1 \u03bc g mL \u2212 1 .",

Comparing to traditional ELISA, which brings a signal from one enzyme for one binding event, an amplifi ed signal from a large number of enzymes conjugated on gold nanoparticles is presented. We have demonstrated sensitive DNA detection through this mechanism.

For some infectious diseases, the lack of fast, cheap, sensitive, and specifi c biosensors is still a major problem. With the development of nanotechnology, we are happy to see recent advancements in the detection of infectious diseases. The application of color changes of gold nanoparticles provides a quite straightforward way to identify antigens and nucleic acids just using the naked eyes. This is potentially important for the screening of infectious diseases all over the world. In some resource-limited countries and remote areas, this is equally important because it is an instrument-free method and a power source is not required. On the other hand, the signal amplifi cation through gold nanoparticles improves the sensitivity of biosensors which can be used effectively in the earliest stage of the infection. The direct idendifi cation of pathogens provides a quite straightforward way to detect infectious diseases, which is very important for the control of diseases before they spread. Some concerns need to be raised, include the practical applications of biosensors in complicated matrices, the stability of biomoleculegold nanoparticle conjugates, and reduction of the number of operation steps involved in detection. et al. covalently modifi ed gold nanorods with primary antibodies specifi c to Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from the upper respiratory tract of sinusitis patients. [ 35 ] The gold nanorod-antibody conjugates specifi cally bind to the target Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this process, the nanorods that covalently conjugated with antibodies have higher binding efficiency than those modifi ed with physically adsorbed antibodies. Near-infrared radiation (NIR) was used to produce localized heating that can cause cellular damage. A 75% decrease in cell viability was observed. A similar method was used to identify the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus with subsequent laser radiation.

Because of the relatively large size of pathogen, a large number of functionalized gold nanoparticles can be adsorbed on the surface of pathogen and aggregate together, which causes obvious color change. [ 37 ] Other than pathogen identifi cation through the specifi c binding of antibody-surface antigen, electrostatic interactions can be used to detect whole pathogens. Rotello et al. used quaternary ammonium ligands to functionalize gold nanoparticles. Then, the functionalized gold nanoparticles were adsorbed on \u03b2 -galactosidase ( \u03b2 -Gal) and thus the enzyme was inhibited. In the presence of target pathogen E. coli , competitive binding of the anionic surface of E. coli to the cationic gold nanoparticles occurred. Then the \u03b2 -Gal was free to catalyze its substrate to initialize a enzymatic reaction. A detection limit of 100 cells mL \u2212 1 was achieved and the detection could be complete in minutes. Furthermore, this method can be translated into a test strip with a visual sensitivity of 104 cells mL \u2212 1 . [ 38 ] Other than the direct identifi cation of pathogens, there is an indirect way to inhibit the pathogens through gold nanoparticle-mediated oligonucleotide delivery. As we mentioned above, the immobilization of oligonucleotides on the surface of gold nanoparticles is very well developed, allowing control of density and direction. We created a polyvalent immunostimulatory nanoagents by conjugating CpG oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles, which can deliver the CpG oligonucleotides into cells and bring immunological effects (unmethylated CpG motifs are widely present in the genomic DNA of invading bacteria and viruses). [ 39 ] It was noted that drug applications of oligonucleotides are largely limited by delivery approaches. Naked Through this simple method, the E. coli can be easily counted.
