Currently, the majority of licensed vaccines are either live attenuated or killed, developed using conventional technologies. However, new subunit vaccines are getting a foothold in the veterinary vaccinology, and among these, virus-like particles (VLPs) represent one of the most appealing approaches (Jennings and Bachmann, 2008), due to their intrinsic immunogenic properties as well as high safety profile, highlighted by several reviews appeared in the last 10 years (Bachmann and Jennings, 2010, D\u2019Aoust et al., 2010, Douglas and Young, 2006, Garcea and Gissmann, 2004, Grgacic and Anderson, 2006, Haynes, 2009, Jennings and Bachmann, 2008, Kang et al., 2009b, Ludwig and Wagner, 2007, Noad and Roy, 2003, Plummer and Manchester, 2011, Roy and Noad, 2008). However, none of these had previously addressed a systematic review about the VLP-based candidate vaccines for use in the veterinary field.",

These protein cages are based on the natural intrinsic ability of many types of structural viral subunits, frequently major proteins in the capsid or envelop, to spontaneously self assemble into VLPs when expressed using recombinant expression systems (Garcea and Gissmann, 2004). They are composed of multiple copies of one or more viral proteins and are usually antigenically indistinguishable from infectious virus or subviral particles (Jennings and Bachmann, 2008).",

            "text": "The multivalent display and highly ordered structure of VLPs constitute pathogen-associated molecular pattern motifs (PAMPs). Since these motifs are, by and large, unique to microbial antigens, the mammalian immune system has evolved to respond vigorously to this arrangement of antigens. PAMPs trigger the innate immune sensing mechanisms (Plummer and Manchester, 2011) and can be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as other pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) which are present in host cells. In addition, due to their highly repetitive surface, VLPs have been shown to induce strong B cell responses by efficiently cross-linking the membrane-associated immunoglobulin molecules that constitute the B-cell receptor (Bachmann and Zinkernagel, 1997). The stimulation of B cells by VLPs is, in some instances, strong enough to elicit T cell-independent induction of IgM antibodies. Hence, there are examples of VLPs acting as T-cell independent B cell antigens (Bachmann et al., 1993, Chackerian et al., 1999, Fehr et al., 1998, Kouskoff et al., 2000). Besides, PAMPs can also stimulate antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and the subsequent presentation of antigens to cells of the adaptive immune response. Beyond the PAMPs property, their particulate nature and dimensions entail VLPs, but not their protein subunits, may be efficiently uptaken by APCs, in particular dendritic cells (DCs). Uptake of antigens by APCs depends upon different properties, such as size, shape, surface charge, etc., being the antigen size a key factor. APCs are able to uptake antigens with pathogen-like dimensions (20 nm to 3 \u03bcm) (Bachmann and Jennings, 2010, Scheerlinck and Greenwood, 2006) and it has been demonstrated that DCs optimally uptake antigens with diameters of approximately 40 nm (Fifis et al., 2004, Xiang et al., 2006), just within the range of VLPs\u2019 size. The fact that VLPs present overall suitable characteristics for their uptake by DCs and subsequent processing and presentation by MHC-II and MHC-I (cross-presentation) pathways, led to describe VLPs as \u201cself-adjuvanting\u201d immunogen delivery systems (Grgacic and Anderson, 2006, Liu et al., 2000, Ludwig and Wagner, 2007, Yan et al., 2004). However, this statement should be tempered by the fact that some VLP-based candidate vaccines require formulation with potent adjuvants in order to induce efficient immune responses (Table 2), indicating that the relative ability of diverse VLP types to induce the different branches of the immune response is influenced by a number of factors that are VLP-specific (Gedvilaite et al., 2006, Goldmann et al., 1999).",

The immune system has multiple mechanisms to robustly respond to virus particles (Grgacic and Anderson, 2006, Spohn and Bachmann, 2008), which may be exploited by VLP-based vaccines. In practical terms, this means that lower doses of antigen relative to monomeric antigen vaccines are sufficient to elicit a similar protective response. This consideration is particularly significant in the case of veterinary vaccines, where the cost of a vaccine must be weighed against the value of the vaccinated animal.",

The conjugation techniques rely on the presence of addressable moieties on the surface of VLPs. If needed, VLPs can be engineered to contain useful attachment sites on the surface of the particle (Mateu, 2011, Strable and Finn, 2009). An advantage of this approach is that the size and structure of the recombinant target antigens are not constrained by the requirements for correct folding of the VLP monomers and particle assembly. Chemical conjugation allows the attachment to VLPs of diverse kinds of target antigens: short linear peptides, cyclic peptides, full-length proteins, or nonprotein targets, such as glycans or small haptens (Raja et al., 2003).",

PCV2, a member of the Circoviridae family, is associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, a swine disease characterized by wasting, weight loss, respiratory distress and diarrhoea, that has a severe economic impact on production (Segales and Domingo, 2002). The immunogen of Porcilis PCV\u00ae is the VLP formed by the ORF2 capsid protein of PCV2, produced using the baculovirus expression system. It is formulated with \u03b1-tocopherol + liquid paraffin-based adjuvant. The vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic and effective against PCV2 infection. It has shown to induce humoral, cell-mediated immunity and protection against porcine circovirus-associated disease under field conditions after one intramuscular dose (Martelli et al., 2011). Moreover, it induces broad immune protection against different genotypes (1 and 2) and various geographical isolates (Fort et al., 2008, Fort et al., 2009). For the same virus, another similar baculovirus expressed subunit vaccine, Ingelvac\u00ae CircoFLEX (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany), has been licensed (Fachinger et al., 2008). It is also based on the expression of the ORF2 capsid protein, and it is adjuvanted with an aqueous polymer (ImpranFLEX\u00ae). There is no information available whether the recombinant protein is assembled into VLPs.",

            "text": "Other swine viruses have been investigated as candidates for the development of VLP-based vaccines. One of the first studied was porcine parvovirus (PPV), a highly infectious virus causing reproductive failure in pigs. PPV\u2013VLPs (VP2 protein) were tested in different animal models administrated by a single intramuscular immunization coupled with different adjuvants. A microgram dose was highly immunogenic, very efficient in preventing transplacental virus transmission and gilts were protected against PPV-induced reproductive failure (Antonis et al., 2006). Thus, Parvoriridae has been shown to be a suitable virus family for the generation of VLP-based vaccines. Indeed, canine parvovirus (CPV) (VP2 protein), muscovy duck parvovirus (DPV) (VPs proteins), goose parvovirus (GPV) (VPs proteins) and mink enteritis virus (MEV) (VP2 protein) VLPs were also studied as vaccine candidates. In a recent preliminary study in geese, GPV\u2013VLPs injected once subcutaneously in 50% mineral oil have shown higher titres of neutralizing antibodies compared with inactivated and attenuated virus in vivo (Ju et al., 2011). Likewise, a previous study in ducks has also shown the production of specific DPV-antibodies after DPV\u2013VLP immunization and the neutralizing antibody levels were consistent with those observed in ducklings inoculated with a commercial inactivated vaccine (Le Gall-Recule et al., 1996). Also, MEV\u2013VLPs have shown to elicit higher antibody response after revaccination compared with a commercial conventional vaccine; interestingly, minks were protected against viral challenge and did not excrete MEV in faeces (Christensen et al., 1994). In addition, two studies used recombinant CPV\u2013VLPs in a prime-boost strategy with adjuvant. Both tested VLPs were able to elicit neutralizing antibodies, sufficient to render all the immunized dogs protected against the viral challenge (Lopez de Turiso et al., 1992, Saliki et al., 1992).",

CAV VP1 and VP2 proteins expressed in insect cells were used to immunize chickens (Koch et al., 1995). Immunization with these proteins was able to elicit neutralizing antibodies and the progeny from immunized chicken was shown to be protected against challenge by CAV, directly after hatching (Koch et al., 1995).

The VLPs demonstrated their effectiveness as immunogens. Levels of specific antibodies, characterized by ELISA, as well as neutralizing antibody titres resulting from NDV\u2013VLP immunization were as high as or even higher than those resulting from immunization with the inactivated whole-virus vaccine, using comparable amounts of antigen. Furthermore, NDV\u2013VLPs stimulated T-cell responses at levels slightly higher than those stimulated by the conventional vaccine (McGinnes et al., 2010). Another important finding was that NDV\u2013VLPs can also be used as platforms to present peptide sequences from other target pathogens, but this topic will be commented in the next section.",

BTV\u2013VLPs have been administered in the presence of various adjuvants to sheep, a vertebrate host susceptible to the virus. The results indicated that these multiprotein VLPs in conjunction with appropriate adjuvant elicited an immune response which protected against an infectious virus challenge (Roy et al., 1992).

            "text": "Viruses from the Picornaviridae family share a common replication strategy and the self-assembly of mature capsid proteins into VLPs. These properties have been shown for several picornaviruses, including equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) and porcine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). These VLPs were generated by co-expression of viral proteins (P1 polyprotein, the nonstructural protein 2A and protease 3C) using different expression systems: ERAV\u2013VLPs were generated using a mammalian expression vector whereas the other VLPs were generated using the baculovirus expression system. ERAV is a respiratory pathogen of horses that may cause an acute febrile respiratory disease or subclinical infection (Li et al., 1997). ERAV\u2013VLPs were tested intramuscularly in mice with three doses followed by boost with UV-inactivated ERAV. The VLP-immunized animals showed significant titres of virus-neutralizing antibodies as well as the induction of a memory response to a neutralizing epitope (Lynch et al., 2011). FMDV causes an economically important disease affecting pigs, cattle and other cloven-hoofed livestock. FMDV\u2013VLPs were tested in guinea pigs. The animals were immunized twice with the VLPs and Montanide ISA 206 adjuvant (SEPPIC). Both, FMDV-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were generated in VLP-immunized animals, but their levels were lower than those induced by the conventional commercial vaccine (Cao et al., 2009). Probably, the poor results obtained with these and other FMDV\u2013VLPs were due to their known low stability, which renders them notoriously difficult to obtain, usually with limited yields (Abrams et al., 1995, Lewis et al., 1991). EMCV causes myocarditis in preweaned pigs and severe reproductive failure in sows (Billinis et al., 1999, Gelmetti et al., 2006); EMCV\u2013VLPs were tested in the natural host, inoculated once or twice using an adjuvant (SEPPIC). The immunization elicited neutralizing antibody levels similar to those obtained after administration of the commercial vaccine. In this study, a prime-boost strategy was more effective than a single-dose immunization, in inducing the production and maintenance of neutralizing antibodies (Jeoung et al., 2011).",

Caliciviruses include important human and animal pathogens, classified into different genera. Noroviruses are the main cause of gastroenteritis in humans worldwide, and have also been described in livestock species, raising concerns regarding their zoonotic potential (Almanza et al., 2008, Bank-Wolf et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2005). Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), the prototype strain of the genus Lagovirus, is the causative agent of an acute and highly contagious disease of rabbits which has decimated wild and domestic rabbit populations all over the world (Angulo and Barcena, 2007, Cooke, 2002). Within the genus Vesivirus, feline calicivirus (FCV) causes respiratory illness in cats. In the last 10 years, there have been sporadic reports of highly virulent outbreaks of FCV disease in cats (Coyne et al., 2006). Recombinant VLPs derived from the single capsid protein (VP1) of caliciviruses belonging to different genera, developed as candidate vaccines, have been reported. VLPs derived from human noroviruses have been used to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice and are being evaluated in human clinical trials (Tacket et al., 2003). Norovirus-derived VLPs have also been used to immunize calves and pigs, both inducing partial protection against a virus challenge (Han et al., 2006, Souza et al., 2007). Better results have been obtained with VLP-based vaccine candidates for RHDV. RHDV\u2013VLPs emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant were injected once to rabbits at different days before lethal challenge. Such immunization was able to protect rabbits against a virulent challenge under the conditions used for commercial vaccine testing in France. Antibodies specific for the RHDV capsid protein could be detected as early as 5 days after vaccination, and the titres progressively increased over a 15-day period (Laurent et al., 1994). Other authors have also reported complete protection of rabbits against a RHDV lethal challenge, induced by RHDV\u2013VLPs (Nagesha et al., 1995, Perez-Filgueira et al., 2007, Plana-Duran et al., 1996). Similarly, FCV\u2013VLPs have been tested in rabbits, which were immunized twice with VLPs and Freund's incomplete adjuvant. A measurable neutralizing antibody response was detected following the first immunization, which increased after boosting. Neutralizing antibody titres remained high throughout 3 months, and sera exhibited neutralizing activity against all the FCV strains analyzed (Di Martino et al., 2007).",

            "text": "One of the first VLPs used as a vector to display foreign viral antigens were those derived from hepatitis B virus (HBV), which belongs to Hepadnaviridae family and is the causative agent of an important disease in humans. A neutralizing epitope derived from the VP1 protein of FMDV was fused to the HBV core antigen protein (HBcAg). The resulting chimeric VLPs elicited virus-neutralizing antibodies against FMDV, and induced a stronger immune response than the corresponding FMDV-peptide, in immunized guinea pigs. Furthermore, the chimeric VLPs were almost as immunogenic as inactivated FMDV particles, and VLP-immunized guinea pigs were completely protected against a challenge with FMDV (Clarke et al., 1987). Several other studies have reported the generation of chimeric HBcAg-derived VLPs incorporating FMDV antigenic epitopes as vaccine candidates, using different approaches. Beesley et al. (1990) produced the chimeric VLPs using a yeast expression system, while Jin et al. (2007) used a system based on the transient expression of DNA plasmids in HeLa cell-cultures. The results obtained in these studies illustrate the potential utility of this vaccine strategy against FMDV. HBcAg-based VLPs were also used to express different epitopes (MHC-I or MHC-II restricted peptides) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a rodent-borne virus. This study was performed to investigate if pre-existing VLP-specific antibodies could interfere with specific cytotoxic T-cell and Th-cell responses, or with the induction of a protective response in mice (Ruedl et al., 2005). In this model, antigen presentation was not significantly affected either in vitro or in vivo by the presence of antibodies against the VLP scaffold, and protective immunity could be established in carrier-vaccinated animals. Thus, Ruedl et al. (2005) opened a new perspective around VLP vectors and the classical concept that previous immunization or maternal antibodies impair the induction of protective immune responses upon vaccination (Albrecht et al., 1977). Indeed, also in the veterinary field, the interference of colostral antibodies has been described in vaccinated animals (Vitour et al., 2011). However, the results reported by Ruedl et al. suggest that pre-existing VLP-specific antibodies are unlikely to be a limiting factor for VLP-based T-cell vaccines, although, further studies need to be performed in veterinary species to fully clarify this aspect. Also Storni et al. used HBcAg expressing a LCMV epitope to investigate the activation of APC for priming CTL responses after VLPs vaccination. In this model they demonstrated that VLPs alone were inefficient at inducing CTL responses and failed to mediate effective protection form viral challenge, but they became very powerful if applied together with other substance that activated APCs (e.g. anti-CD40 antibodies or CpG) (Storni et al., 2002).",

Our group has identified three sites suitable for the insertion of heterologous immunogenic epitopes within the RHDV capsid protein (Barcena et al., 2004, Crisci et al., 2009, Luque et al., 2012). We generated recombinant chimeric RHDV-VLPs incorporating the MHC-I-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitope SIINFEKL, derived from chicken ovalbumin (OVA). The foreign epitope was inserted at two different locations (at the N-terminus and in a predicted exposed loop of the viral capsid protein) and the corresponding chimeric VLPs were tested for their immunogenicity in the mouse model. In vitro results showed that RHDV\u2013VLPs activated DCs and these were able to process and present the foreign epitope for CD8+ specific recognition in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, in the absence of adjuvant, those chimeric RHDV-VLPs were able to stimulate specific IFN-\u03b3-producing cell priming and a powerful CTL response, mainly when the foreign epitope was inserted at N-terminus of the RHDV capsid protein. Mice immunized twice with the chimeric RHDV\u2013VLPs were able to control an infection by a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing OVA in target organs (Crisci et al., 2009). Similar results were reported by other group using RHDV\u2013VLPs displaying the same OVA-derived epitope incorporated by chemical conjugation (Peacey et al., 2008). In this study the conjugated RHDV\u2013VLPs were administered with adjuvant (CpG) and tested for anti-tumor response in the mouse model. The results obtained indicated that the vaccination with the conjugated VLPs resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth (Peacey et al., 2008). Chimeric RHDV\u2013VLPs have also been shown to be efficient vaccine vectors to immunize pigs, eliciting both, strong humoral and cellular responses against an inserted foreign epitope derived from FMDV (Crisci et al., 2012). Another reported use of chimeric RHDV\u2013VLPs was as gene transfer vector. Chimeric RHDV\u2013VLPs harbouring DNA-binding sequences derived from human papillomavirus were able to package plasmid DNA and thus transfer genes into animal cells (Cos-7), opening the way for an alternative method for gene transfer (El Mehdaoui et al., 2000).",

More importantly, NDV\u2013VLPs can be used to present entire ectodomains of glycoproteins from other viruses. Since NDV glycoproteins are assembled into VLPs owing to specific interactions of the glycoprotein cytoplasmic (CT) and transmembrane (TM) domains with the virus core proteins, incorporation of a foreign glycoprotein ectodomain into NDV\u2013VLPs can be achieved by generating a chimeric protein gene composed of sequences encoding the foreign protein ectodomain fused to those encoding the TM and CT domains of the appropriate NDV glycoprotein. Using this approach, the entire ectodomains of Nipah virus G, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were successfully inserted into NDV\u2013VLPs (Morrison, 2010). An interesting result was that immunization with NDV\u2013VLPs containing the ectodomain of the RSV G protein provided complete protection from RSV replication in lungs, after intranasal challenge with live virus in the murine system (Murawski et al., 2010). Furthermore, this approach enables the incorporation into a single particle preparation of ectodomains derived from two different viruses (Morrison, 2010), raising the possibility of using NDV\u2013VLPs as a single vaccine against two different pathogens. For example, assembly of the NDV HN protein and the influenza HA protein into a single VLP could be used to protect chickens from both avian influenza and NDV, although such a divalent vaccine has not been reported yet.",

In this approach the heterologous peptides are inserted by genetic fusion at exposed loops within viral capsid proteins, resulting in the formation of viable chimeric virus particles. In contrast with VLPs, these chimeric whole-virus particles are replication competent and are therefore infectious in plants, their natural hosts. The engineered viruses are propagated in plants and subsequently, the corresponding purified chimeric virus particles are used as immunogens in target animals. Since the plant viruses are unable to replicate in mammals, the chimeric virus particles (often termed viral nanoparticles) behave similarly to VLPs in terms of safety and the immune response induced. Both, filamentous and icosahedral plant viruses have been successfully developed as foreign epitope presentation systems (Canizares et al., 2005, Rybicki, 2009, Sainsbury et al., 2010, Yusibov et al., 2006). The most popular systems are tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV).",

Moreover, suckling mice passively transferred with antisera from guinea pigs immunized with chimeric TMV virions were protected from a lethal viral challenge, indicating that vaccination with the chimeric viral particles elicited neutralizing antibodies against FMDV. Finally, results in swine clearly demonstrated that chimeric viral particles significantly protected pigs against a FMDV challenge (Wu et al., 2003). TMV was also used to display the 5B19 epitope from murine hepatitis virus (MHV) using different protocols for immunogen-administration to mice. Chimeric virus particles protected mice against a lethal challenge in a dose-dependent manner and the level of protection was shown to be dependent on the route (parenteral or mucosal) of immunization. The regimen of vaccination positively correlated with the amount of antibody and the degree of protection. Subcutaneous administration needed less amount of immunogen for effective protection (Koo et al., 1999).",

VLPs made by the assembly of a single protein are usually able to be produced in large amounts and high quality, whereas structurally complex VLPs in some instances raise difficulties for large scale production (Cox, 2012, Mena and Kamen, 2011, Roldao et al., 2011). In addition, due to the inherent properties of the lipid envelope, production of enveloped VLPs is technically more complex (Roldao et al., 2011). However, progresses are being made, and it is expected that in the near future the integration of process optimization tools (i.e., molecular biology, genetic engineering and systems biology) will overcome some of the current limitations affecting the large scale production of several types of VLPs (Vicente et al., 2011a).",

This expression system has many advantages for VLP production (for recent reviews see (Cox, 2012, Mena and Kamen, 2011, Roldao et al., 2011, van Oers, 2011, Vicente et al., 2011b). Large amounts of correctly folded recombinant proteins can be produced with eukaryotic-like post-translational modifications. Although yeast and bacteria cells can achieve similar yields, the complexity of the VLPs produced with the baculovirus expression system is remarkably higher (VLPs formed from up to five proteins). An additional advantage is that baculoviruses have a limited host range (namely for insects) and are hence safe for vertebrates. Insect cells to be used in the baculovirus expression system are derived from lepidopteran insects and are relatively easy to grow. They can grow in serum-free media and the cultures can easily be scaled up. The design of recombinant baculoviruses is simple and fast, providing a high versatility to this expression system. This is very important when producing vaccines for viruses whose surface proteins rapidly mutate (e.g., influenza A virus), a fundamental requirement to contend with potential pandemics in a timely manner. Nevertheless, this expression system presents important drawbacks. One of the main limitations is the significant coproduction of infective baculovirus particles, which are difficult to separate from VLPs. The baculovirus particles can interfere with the immunogenicity of the VLP-based vaccines (Hervas-Stubbs et al., 2007). Furthermore, the potential contamination of VLP preparations with infective recombinant baculoviruses raises environmental concerns. For this reason, VLP-based immunogens produced in the baculovirus expression system must undergo either chemical inactivation treatments to eliminate baculovirus infectivity that may impair the quality of the produced VLPs (Rueda et al., 2000) or several downstream bioseparation processing steps that may increase final production costs (Mena and Kamen, 2011). Following this line of thought, a promising novel approach has been recently reported that might greatly simplify the downstream processing of biopharmaceuticals produced in insect cells (Marek et al., 2011). The new strategy is based on the use of recombinant baculoviruses lacking a gene (vp80) which is essential for virus formation, but does not affect foreign gene expression. The deletion is trans-complemented in a transgenic insect cell line used to generate the baculovirus seed stock, and the resulting defective baculoviruses can then be used to produce large amounts of recombinant proteins without contaminating virions.",

            "text": "Regarding the use of VLPs as foreign epitope display platforms, both strategies, the generation of chimeric VLPs by genetic fusion and the chemical conjugation of antigens to VLPs pose some limitations. In order to induce high-titre antibody responses effectively, target antigens must be displayed on the surface of VLPs, in immunodominant regions and at a high density. Consequently, one of the key points for generating chimeric VLPs is the selection of suitable insertion sites, which must be present on the surface of the VLP and should not interfere with protein folding and assembly. However, generating chimeric VLPs is largely empirical; it is almost impossible to predict whether individual peptides will be compatible with VLP assembly or whether the insertions will be immunogenic. Another important limitation of the chimeric approach is that the size and nature of epitopes that can be inserted into VLPs, in particular into their immunodominant regions, is restricted. VLPs containing peptides longer than 20 amino acids often fail to assemble. Relatively large insertions have been successfully incorporated into VLPs (Caballero et al., 2004, Charpilienne et al., 2001, Kratz et al., 1999), but these tend to be the exception more than the rule. These size limitations restrict the number of epitopes that can be targeted with an individual chimeric VLP. By contrast, the flexibility of the alternative approach based on the chemical conjugation of target antigens to previously assembled native VLPs offers substantial advantages, although it is dependent on the accessibility of addressable residues on both the VLP and the target antigen. On the other hand, from a manufacturing standpoint, the genetic fusion approach may have advantages over chemical conjugation, since chimeric VLPs can be produced and purified using the same well-established methods used to purify unmodified parental VLPs, whereas the production process of conjugated VLPs entails extra challenges and the quality control methods are inevitably more complex.",

Since pathogens usually undergo antigenic variation in response to host immune pressures, vaccines based on VLPs displaying foreign epitopes will only be effective against highly conserved B- or T-cell epitopes. Consequently, VLPs appear best suited to target highly conserved antigens. An example of such an appropriate target is the 23-amino acid extracellular domain of M2 protein from influenza A virus, which is highly conserved among viral strains, and has been shown to induce protection in mice against a lethal challenge, upon administration as a peptide incorporated on HBV-derived VLPs (Jegerlehner et al., 2002, Neirynck et al., 1999).",
