Due to the impact of lung diseases on chamois populations, the investigation of respiratory pathogens is important for wildlife conservation and for the understanding of infection transmission at the livestock-wildlife interface. In the present study, a novel respirovirus was isolated from a chamois with lung lesions and characterized by full-genome sequence and phylogeny. The genome characterization of this novel virus revealed similarities to domestic ruminant respiroviruses, mainly of caprine and ovine origin. Overall, phylogenetic analyses indicated that the chamois virus is distinct from already defined species and suggested that it is a putative novel member of the genus Respirovirus. The present investigation contributes to the knowledge of respiratory infections in wild ruminants and raises questions on the epidemiological link between chamois and other animal species.",

Here we report the identification and genetic characterization of a respirovirus in an Alpine chamois showing interstitial pneumonia associated with catarrhal bronchopneumonia. The full-genome characterization of this respirovirus, named ChamoisRV/IT2014, revealed low similarities to caprine respirovirus (77.1%), bovine respirovirus (74.5%) and human respirovirus (72.0%). The phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length genome sequence of the novel isolate and reference respirovirus strains showed that ChamoisRV/IT2014 clustered with caprine respirovirus but formed a separate branch. The phylogenetic tree topology of complete large protein amino acid sequences, representing the current species demarcation criterion for Respirovirus genus, showed a 0.05 branch length of ChamoisRV/IT2014 sequence between the nearest node and the tip of the branch, suggesting that this virus belongs to a novel species. This new isolate in a new host species raises several questions to be addressed on the epidemiological role of chamois and the risks of cross-transmission between wild ruminants and livestock.",

The supernatant of the infected cell cultures preliminarily observed by the nsEM revealed the presence of virus particles with morphological features indicative of the paramyxovirus family. In particular, in addition to some intact virions, several disintegrating particles with free nucleocapsid chains were observed ( Figure 2 ). Subsequently, a complete viral genome was efficiently obtained starting from the cell culture supernatant. BLAST analysis of the whole genome of the chamois virus, named ChamoisRV/IT2014, revealed CRV3 as the most similar sequence (accession number MK091103 80.1%). The whole genome of ChamoisRV/IT2014 showed 77.1% nucleotide identity with CRV3 reference strain JS2013, 74.5% with BRV3 genotype A (BRV3a) strain TVMDL60, 74.2% with BRV3 genotype B strain Q5592, 73.9% with BRV3 genotype C strain SD0835 and 72.0% with HRV3 strain AUS/5/2007. The phylogenetic tree with other respirovirus strains, including publicly available sequences of BRV3, CRV3, HRV1-3, PRV1 and MRV, showed that ChamoisRV/IT2014 clustered with RV3 ( Figure 3 ) and formed a significant clade with CRV3 [2] using the ML method. Similar results were obtained using NJ. Pairwise comparisons of the nucleotide sequence of coding regions and corresponding deduced amino acid sequences of ChamoisRV/IT2014 with reference strains of CRV3, BRV3 and HRV3 genotypes are reported in Table 1 . The ChamoisRV/IT2014 nucleotide sequence of coding regions showed a slightly higher identity with CRV3 compared to BRV3, reaching values ranging from 78.2% for hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) to 81.9% for the nucleoprotein (N) gene. The only exception was phosphoprotein (P) that shared a similar identity with both CRV3 (72.2%) and BRV3 (72.2%-73.1%). The matrix (M), large (L) and N protein sequences showed higher amino acid identity values compared to the other coding regions, sharing with CRV3 the highest values of 91.5%, 89.2% and 89.1%, respectively. The P protein sequence showed the lowest amino acid identity values compared to the other coding regions, ranging from 53.0% with HRV3 to 59.2% with CRV3. The phylogenetic tree topology of complete L protein amino acid sequences of members of the family Paramyxoviridae showed a 0.05 branch length of ChamoisRV/IT2014 sequence between the nearest node and the tip of the branch (Figure 4) . A highly conserved motif, located near the middle of the N proteins and thought to be essential in N-N self-assembly and the N-RNA interaction process, was found in the central domain of the N proteins from the chamois virus, as 323 FAPGNYPALWSYAM 336 , and was also observed in CRV3 [2] . The HN protein contained the conserved binding site sequence, 254 NRKSCS 259 [26] , suggesting a neuraminic acid containing cellular receptor. The results of the analysis of DNA polymorphisms and synonymous or nonsynonymous sites are reported in the Supplementary data (Table S1 ). Concerning the analysis of the estimation of positive selection sites, there was no evidence that any sites have experienced diversifying selection.",

The finding of the novel RV3 being limited to one animal only could be related to a likely short-phase of virus replication in the lungs, and direct detection was thus restricted. Moreover, virus isolation is a diagnostic technique that requires a virus that is able to replicate in cell culture, therefore the sensitivity could be limited. The use of pan-paramyxoviridae primers previously published, especially universal primers for respiroviruses [27] , as well as the set-up of a specific RT-PCR have to be considered in respiratory pathogen panels to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and confirm the presence of the novel RV3 RNA in lung samples of chamois. The evidence of seropositive chamois, showing VN antibodies against ChamoisRV/IT2014, supports the circulation of this infection in the study area. This needs to be investigated to determine the real diffusion of this novel agent in chamois population and establish its epidemiological role.",

Nevertheless, the negative results for other viral or bacterial respiratory pathogens could be biased by the storage condition of lung samples (\u221220 \u2022 C) and by an analytical protocol focused on viral isolation. The phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length genome sequence of the novel isolate and reference respirovirus strains showed that ChamoisRV/IT2014 significantly clustered with CRV3 but formed a separated branch. Despite this, we generated a comprehensive dataset of animal RV3 publicly available from GenBank; there were relatively few whole genome sequences available, and no other RV3 sequence clustered with ChamoisRV/IT2014. The nucleotide identity for the ChamoisRV/IT2014 complete genome with respirovirus reference strains, including CRV3, was 80% or below, revealing nucleotide differences higher than the ones observed among genotypes and members of Respirovirus genus [2, 28] . The comparison of complete L protein amino acid sequences, representing the current species demarcation criterion for Respirovirus genus [26] , shows that ChamoisRV/IT2014 possesses sequence differences from the other respirovirus species. Moreover, although the phylogenetic analysis of ChamoisRV/IT2014 based on M, HN and F genes, used as targets for genetic typing of RV3 [5] , confirms the highest nucleotide identity with CRV3, it shows low nucleotide identity for all three genes.",
