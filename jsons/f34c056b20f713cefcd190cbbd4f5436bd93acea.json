Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has become a relentless epidemic in Italy with a dramatic increase in the number of patients showing COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure and hypoxemia. Considering the epidemiologic data reported from China, 2,3 it was immediately clear that the number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission would rapidly overwhelm the total ICU capacity, thereby resulting in an unexpected systemic crisis due to the imbalance between increased health care demand and potential of supply. 4 As soon as the first COVID-19 victim in Italy was recorded, an emergency technical and scientific committee was promptly formed by the local government of Veneto to coordinate the response to the emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the region. The task force included 10 experts on infectious diseases, intensive care, and health management.",

Respiratory high-dependency units were staffed by pulmonologists already familiar with the treatment of respiratory failure and were dedicated to hypoxemic patients requiring noninvasive respiratory assistance, such as high-flow oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation, including continuous positive airway pressure. The patient-to-nurse ratio was less than that of a typical ward but more than that in an ICU. The surge of respiratory highdependency units aimed to save ICU beds for the most critically ill patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and multiple organ support therapies. Furthermore, this strong enhancement created an intermediate step between the ordinary medical ward and the ICU, allowing for a more rapid ICU discharge and patient turnover.",

In fact, only 3,487 (36.2%) required hospital admission, 10% of whom necessitated treatment in the ICU (Fig 2) Until the beginning of March, the number of patients requiring ICU admission roughly matched the number of patients discharged or who died in an ICU. In the following weeks, however, the number of patients requiring ICU admission exceeded the number of deaths or discharged patients (Fig 3) . Nonetheless, the occupancy rate of ICUs in the region remained constant, consequent to the increase of available beds (Figs 1 and 4) . The number of ICU beds occupied by non-COVID-19 patients decreased over time (see Fig 4) , which likely can be ascribed to the suspension of ordinary surgical activity with planned postoperative ICU monitoring and to the reduction in the number of major traumas as a consequence of the restrictions imposed on everyday life activities. Therefore, the usual triage decision-making for ICU admission did not need to be modified, and all patients requiring advanced life support therapies were allocated easily.",
