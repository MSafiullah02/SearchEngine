It must be borne in mind that the sample on average was not severely vitamin D deficient and results may differ in populations with a higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency. As shown in Table 1 , there was no difference in 25(OH)D status by gender; however 25(OH)D was significantly lower in those with obesity [P<0.001] by 9 nmol/L compared with those of normal or overweight. Of note, 25(OH)D status was also significantly lower in those of Asian, Black and Mixed ethnicity (by 16nmol/L) [P<0.001] compared with those of White ethnicity. This supports previous findings of a low serum 25(OH)D in UK South Asian individuals from the UK DFINES study 1 . Being a regular smoker (smoking on all or most days) was associated with a reduced odds (OR=0.58 (0.39-0.86)) of testing positive, compared with being a non-smoker (OR=1). However a key limitation of this analysis is that there were only a small number of regular smokers (n 142) and persons of Asian, Black or Mixed/Other Ethnicity in the sample and larger populations will be required to confirm these results.",

However, there is scientific evidence to show that that an individual's vitamin D status tends to track over time; for example, those with status in the top quartile of 25(OH)D status in the population will likely still be in that range over a decade later 2 . Therefore, we used quartiles of 25(OH)D status in our analysis rather than the specific 25(OH)D value which showed a null association with Covid-19 test result. When a BMI x 25(OH)D status (continuous variable) interaction term was trialed in the model, it was not statistically significant suggesting the interaction between BMI and 25(OH)D status did not predict test result in the currently available dataset.",
