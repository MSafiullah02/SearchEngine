Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has 10 been responsible for a worldwide pandemic resulting in over 4 million infections and over 250,000 11 deaths. The pandemic has instigated widespread research related to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease 12 that it causes, COVID-19. Research into this new virus will be facilitated by the availability of clearly 13 described and effective procedures that enable the propagation and quantification of infectious 14 virus. Because work with the virus is recommended to be performed at biosafety level 3, validated 15 methods to effectively inactivate the virus to enable safe study of RNA, DNA and protein from 16 infected cells are also needed. Here, we report methods used to grow SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cell 17 lines and to measure virus infectivity by plaque assay using either agarose or microcrystalline 18 cellulose as an overlay as well as a SARS-CoV-2 specific focus forming assay. We also demonstrate 19 effective inactivation by TRIzol, 10% neutral buffered formalin, beta propiolactone, and heat.",

While agarose generally performs well as an overlay medium for numerous 210 different viruses, the requirement of having to remove agarose plug from within multi-well cell 211 culture dishes can prove laborious. This is especially the case when plaque assays are performed in plates. Recently, a novel low-viscosity overlay medium for viral plaque assays has been216 described [10]. This assay replaces traditional solid (agarose) and semi-solid (methylcellulose) 217 media with a microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) suspension as the overlay media. To determine 218 whether the MCC approach is suitable for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 by plaque assay, we overlaid 219 SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells with two concentrations of MCC (0.6% and 1.2%) in 6, 12, and 24 Propagation and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. (A) Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.001 and monitored daily by microscopy for the presence of CPE.

Our results indicate that MCC performs exceptionally well as an overlay medium for 221 SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays as uniform and countable plaques are readily apparent 72 hours post-222 infection, even in the 24 well plate format (Figure 2 A-B). We have also determined that either of the 223 two concentrations of MCC tested yielded plaques of comparable size. Based on this we would 224 recommend the use of 0.6% MCC overlay media (Figure 2A) for SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays as it 225 produces uniform and easily identifiable plaques for quantification. While it is possible to identify 226 plaques at 48 hours post-infection with 0.6% MCC overlay, similar to the 0.4% agarose overlay (Figure 227 1B), the plaques are small and difficult to accurately quantify until 72 hours post-infection.",

Based on the replication kinetics observed in 324 Caco-2 cells, it is likely that if the infection were allowed to progress past 72 hours that higher titers 325 would have been achieved. Huh7 and 293T cells exhibited modest growth of SARS-CoV-2, and A549 326 cells did not support SARS-CoV-2 replication at any of the tested timepoints. Therefore, these cell 327 lines are not ideal hosts for virological studies with SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of modifications such Heat Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 containing samples (1x10 6 pfu) were heated at 100C for 5, 10 and 15 minutes and 56C for 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Samples were assayed by plaque assay to detect remaining infectious virus post-heating. The room temperature control was incubated at room temperature until all heated samples were prepared. Data are representative of the mean and SEM of 3 replicates.",

Cells were kept in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator without 63 antibiotics or antimycotics. SARS-CoV-2, strain USA_WA1/2020, was obtained from the World Reference Collection for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston. A lyophilized ampule of SARS-CoV-2 was initially resuspended in DMEM supplemented 70 with 2% FBS. VeroE6 cells were inoculated in duplicate with a dilution of 1:100 with an adsorption 71 period of 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and shaking every 15 minutes. Cells were observed for cytopathic effect 72 (CPE) every 24 hours. Stock SARS-CoV-2 virus was harvested at 72 hours post infection (h.p.i) and supernatants were collected, clarified, aliquoted, and stored at -80\u00b0C. For replication kinetic experiments, cells were seeded into 24 well plates at confluency in DMEM supplemented in 10% FBS. The next day, cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Supernatants were harvested at the indicated timepoints and 77 stored at -80C until analysis.Vero E6 cells were seeded into 6, ,12, or 24-well plates 24 hours before infection. 10-fold serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 samples were added, adsorbed for 1 hour at 37C with shaking at 15minute intervals. After the absorption period, 2 mL of 0.3% agarose in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS or 3 mL of 0.6 or 1.2 percent microcrystalline cellulose (MCC; Sigma 435244) in serum-free DMEM was added. To stain plaque assays performed with an agarose overlay, 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) was added on top of the agarose and incubated for one hour at room temperature.The agarose plug was then removed with a pipette tip, and the fixed monolayer was stained with 88 0.4% crystal violet in 20% methanol. For plaque assays performed with MCC overlay, the MCC was aspirated out, 10% NBF added for one hour at room temp and then removed. Monolayers were then washed with water and stained with 0.4% crystal violet. Plaques were quantified and recorded as Vero E6 cells were plated into 96 well plates at confluency (75000 cells/well) in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Prior to infection, virus stocks were thawed and serially diluted to obtain dilutions in the range of 10 -2 to 10 -9 . Growth media was removed from the Vero E6 cells and 50 \u00b5L of virus dilutions was plated. Virus was adsorbed for 1 hour at 37C/5% CO2. After adsorption, 50 \u00b5L of 2.4% MCC overlay supplemented with DMEM 100 powdered media to a concentration of 1X (Gibco) was added to each well of the 96 well plate to 101 achieve a final MCC overlay concentration of 1.2%. Plates were then incubated at 37C/5% CO2 for 24 102 hours. The MCC overlay was gently removed and cells were fixed with 10% NBF for 1 hour at roomtemperature. After removal of NBF, monolayers were washed with ultrapure water and 100% 104 methanol/0.3% H2O2 was added to permeabilize cells and quench endogenous peroxidase activity.",

            "text": "(MCC). In our hands, both approaches yielded comparable data. However, the MCC overlay approach has significant advantages over the more traditional agarose overlay. MCC overlays do not require heating prior to use which significantly expedites the processing of large numbers of plaque assays and also alleviates concerns of overheating cell monolayers. Additionally, MCC overlays do not require the removal of a \"plug\" like in the use of agarose overlays as MCC overlays remain liquid 338 throughout their use. They can simply be aspirated, and monolayer can be further processed.However, due to the fact that MCC overlays remain liquid throughout the course of the assay, it is important to take care that plaque assays utilizing MCC as an overlay are not moved until harvested to ensure reliable data. Our data presented here demonstrate that MCC is an effective and efficient 342 overlay alternative to agarose for SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays.While plaque assays are perhaps the most commonly used technique for the quantification 344 of infectious virus, immunohistochemical focus forming assays are also commonly used for the 345 quantification of virus [10,16-18]. We have established that SARS-CoV-2 can be reliably quantified by 346 a 96 well plate-based focus forming assay in only 24 hours. When compared to traditional plaque 347 assays for SARS-CoV-2 which require 72 hours for easily quantifiable plaques, the ability to quantify 348 infectious SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours in a 96 well plate format represents a significant advantage 349 for studies requiring higher-throughput. While it is important to acknowledge that titers acquired 350 with a focus forming assay will generally be one log lower than those acquired by traditional plaque assay, the focus forming assay described here is fully capable of differentiating log-scale changes in virus titer. Taken together, the focus forming assay described here is a rapid and efficient method for quantifying infectious SARS-CoV-2.Currently the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)is for studies involving the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 to be performed within BSL3 laboratories 356 with standard BSL3 practices. While an official risk group determination has not been made for SARS-CoV-2, the related viruses SARS-CoV and MERS are classified as risk-group 3 pathogens. As a BSL3 pathogen, having validated methods to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is important so as to ensure safety while also allowing removal of samples to lower biosafety levels for analysis. For example, whole inactivated virus can serve as antigen for immunological assays, vaccine preparations, and for the analysis of virus composition. We chose to examine beta-propiolactone as a means to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. This method was chosen because it preserves virus structure and antigenicity, and it has recently been used to generate an inactivated vaccine preparation for SARS-CoV-2 [15]. Our data show that treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with beta-propiolactone at a concentration of 0.5% for 16 hours at 4C followed by 2 hours at 37C will yield intact viral particles that can be utilized safely for downstream purposes.The isolation of viral RNA and protein from virus or virus infected cells or the isolation RNA from host cells is critical to characterize virus sequence variation and to study the impact of infection on host gene expression. TRIzol is a commonly used reagent for RNA isolation that can also be used to for DNA and protein isolation. Our data show that treatment of SARS-CoV-2 containing samples with TRIzol following the manufacturer's instructions is an effective method of inactivating SARS-",
