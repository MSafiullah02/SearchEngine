The PCR products of S1\u2013S9 were purified and sequenced directly. Vector sequencing was applied only when obtaining extra bands for S1. The band with the expected size was purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), subcloned using the plasmid pGEM-T Easy vector system (Promega), and sequenced using the same protocol as described for direct sequencing [15]. MST genotypes were determined for ten strains from the mongooses and one strain from the masked palm civet. Ten strains from cats were also subjected to MST analysis. Out of ten cat strains, seven are derived from Okinawa Prefecture where the mongooses were captured. The other three cat strains are derived from near the areas of Chiba, Kanagawa and Tokyo Prefectures where the masked palm civet was captured. The MST genotype of each strain was defined by the combination of the S1\u2013S9 genotypes. The genotypes of the intergenic spacers and MSTs were assigned numbers according to the previous reports [13, 21, 22].

Masked palm civets have been sold for human consumption at wild live markets in China [11] and other Asian countries. Interestingly, a CSD case caused by a masked palm civet was reported in 2001 in Japan. In this case, the patient, who was scratched in the left leg by a pet masked palm civet, developed fever and left inguinal lymphadenopathy with high antibody titre (1:1024) to B. hensleae [30]. Taking into account the similar prevalence to cats in the examined areas, the high bacteraemic levels with no clinical and pathological abnormalities, similar MST genotypes to the cat and human strains of B. henselae, and the close contact between humans and these animals, the small Indian mongoose and the masked palm civet in the suborder Feliformia appear to serve as new reservoirs for B. henselae, and may play a role as potential sources of human infection.",
