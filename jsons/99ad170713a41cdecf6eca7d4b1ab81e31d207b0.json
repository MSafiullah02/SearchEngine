Our department reduced the medical staff to the minimum necessary to perform emergency interventions and all other procedures were cancelled after careful revision. 1 Here, we present our point of view regarding the preparation needed of a vascular unit for the 2 end of COVID-19 crisis. The extrapolation can help other units to find the best way to organise 3 and to foresee upcoming events.",
