Stolen property may include computers (personal, laptop, and notebook), personal data assistants, mobile telephones, fax machines, calculators, and general office equipment. An unauthorized item might be a sensitive or a classified document that is not to be removed from a certain area or from the building.2.\nTo prevent dangerous items entering. Explosives are the usual concern, but other items such as cameras or firearms might be prohibited. (As a result of September 11, 2001, metal detectors and X-ray systems, although not in common use in office buildings, were deployed in some landmark facilities as a screening measure for weapons and explosive material concealed on people and contained in packages and other containers.)3.\nTo prevent unnecessary or disruptive delivery traffic. By keeping out misdirected deliveries, unnecessary traffic is avoided. By routing deliveries through proper entrances, such as loading docks and freight/service elevators, disruptive traffic is avoided and, in some cases, the building and passenger elevators are protected against damage from hand trucks and bulky crates. By intercepting deliveries at these entrances to the building, it may be possible to detect intruders posing as delivery persons.\n",

At that location, building couriers employed by a contract courier or a security company assigned to the building sign for the items and deliver them within the building by way of the freight/service elevators.

Depending on the size of the janitorial staff, designated supervisors within the janitorial operation may be issued master keys that, for instance, provide access to all tenant spaces on an individual floor. In this way, the general cleaning staff does not need to be issued keys. In some buildings, no janitorial staff is issued keys, and security staff must unlock the appropriate doors and relock them after the work is completed. Procedures will vary from building to building depending on size, complexity, and the manner in which cleaning is conducted and trash is removed.\u2022Elevator, escalator, dumbwaiter, chute (rubbish, mail, laundry, and linen), and moving walk technicians may be permitted to carry keys that provide access to their equipment, or the building may retain possession and issue them only as needed.\n",

This practice is convenient because the building staff is not required to open these areas, but it compromises security because control of keys and the areas themselves has been lost. These areas could be used to store unauthorized or stolen items, and general housekeeping may become a problem. If this practice is permitted, no one should be allowed to place a lock on a door without building security or other building departments (such as engineering) having a key. In an emergency, keys must be available for access. A possible alternative is for contractors to store their equipment, including tools, in heavily reinforced, large steel boxes, chests, and cabinets that can be secured using high-security padlocks, which are protected from attack with cutting tools.",

Of course, it will be necessary to eventually replace all the locks in the system, but by using the method just described, the cost can be spread out over several budgeting periods.\u201d25 Whether to immediately rekey the building or delay in this suggested manner is a risk-based decision that should only be undertaken by the building owner or manager.

The purpose is to report obstructions (particularly those blocking emergency egress routes), fire hazards, missing equipment (such as portable fire extinguishers), water or gas leaks, wet floors, holes, defects in floor coverings, tiles missing, unsecured areas, malfunctioning lighting equipment, signs of forced entry, unauthorized and suspicious persons, and others (including building staff) found in areas in which they would not normally belong, and so on.\u2022\nContinuously in parking garages and lots to deter theft of vehicles and property within them; note parking violations (including vehicles improperly parked, parked in a NO PARKING zone or space, parked in a RESERVED zone or space, or parked in a DISABLED/PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED designated space), and issue warnings or citations, or institute vehicle towing actions; observe vehicle lights or engines left on, leaks from vehicles, or other unusual conditions of parked vehicles; report fire hazards, water or gas leaks, malfunctioning lighting equipment, broken vehicle windows and other signs of forced entry, unauthorized and suspicious persons, and others (including building staff) found in areas in which they would not normally belong; and provide for the general safety of tenants and visitors.

Keep in mind, entering a tenant office may place the patrol officer in a \u201cdifficult and sensitive\u201d situation, particularly after normal business hours. If it is necessary for a security officer to enter a tenant area after hours, another officer should accompany him or her. These officers should knock on the door before opening it and call out loudly to identify themselves and their intentions. Such actions can help avoid embarrassing and awkward situations and protect staff from unfair accusations. If entering tenant space is only permitted under special situations, it may be wise to also be accompanied by a building engineer or other building staff member.

All building users, particularly tenants and their visitors, should be made aware of the program and how various policies and procedures impact them. If people are aware of the logic behind security regulations, they usually will be more willing to comply with them. This communication can be achieved in the following ways:1.Explain the regulations on an informal, as-needed basis. For example, building security staff may explain the purpose of an after-hours access register to a tenant when asking him to sign it, or staff may inform a visitor leaving the building that she must have a property removal pass signed by the tenant she just visited before the computer she is carrying can be permitted to leave the building.2.Use posted signs; written policies and procedures published in the Tenant Manual and on the building\u2019s Web site; pamphlets, leaflets, flyers, newsletters, e-mails, and video training materials supplied by building management to the tenant or by tenant management to its employees. Sometimes, information is displayed on in-car elevator video screens. Such elevator bulletins may, for example, provide information that reminds occupants that in the event the elevator stops running, they should immediately use the elevator emergency communication device to request assistance, or the bulletins may be used to post other appropriate emergency notifications.3.Conduct security and safety orientation lectures, classes, briefings, workshops, and seminars. These events can be an effective medium not only for communicating to tenants what is required of them in the building security program, but also as an opportunity to educate employees about basic security and safety measures they can adopt at home. (Such measures could include being aware of their surroundings; elevator safety; securing vehicle doors and windows; not leaving valuable items in view in parked vehicles; securing desks, filing cabinets, laptop computers, computer storage devices, and personal property; and observing a \u201cclean tabletop\u201d policy.) The length of such events will vary, but 45 minutes to an hour is probably the maximum that busy tenants will permit. As with all effective teaching, the use of audio-visual aids \u2014 films, videotapes, DVDs, and slides \u2014 can help gain the participants\u2019 attention and assist in effectively communicating the required message. The frequency of classes, meetings, conferences, seminars, and workshops will vary from building to building; they may be regularly scheduled or conducted when a specific need arises. Security training can be incorporated effectively into occupants\u2019 fire life safety training classes. More will be said about the training of occupants, floor wardens, and building emergency staff in the next section.\n",
