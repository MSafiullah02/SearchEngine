Only for a few virus-host systems, the velocity of genome replication (number of nucleotides incorporated into a growing viral RNA or DNA genome per unit time) has been calculated. Early studies indicated that the average time needed to synthesize an entire plus strand of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 RNA (4220 nucleotides) in vivo was about 90 s (Robertson, 1975). For poliovirus (PV) it has been estimated that it takes about 1 min to synthesize a full-length genomic RNA (7440 nucleotides) and that when PV RNA synthesis reaches its maximum, 2000\u20133000 RNA molecules are produced per cell and minute (Richards and Ehrenfeld, 1990, Paul, 2002). HCV polymerase incorporates 5 to 20 nucleotides per second (reviewed in Fung et al., 2014) These values imply that with the mutation rates and frequencies typical of RNA viruses (Chapter 2) mutant distributions of 105 to 107 genomes can be produced in infected cell cultures or host organisms in minutes.",

            "text": "In the course of infections by HIV-1, it has been estimated that 1010 to 1011 new virions are produced each day (Coffin, 1995, Ho et al., 1995). The average life span of cells productively infected with HIV-1 has been estimated in 1\u20132.2 days, with a half-life (t\u00bd) of about 1.5 days. The average life span of HIV-1 virions in plasma is about 6 h, with a t\u00bd of 2\u20134 h (Ho, 1995, Wei et al., 1995, Perelson et al., 1996, Markowitz et al., 2003). The half-life of HCV particles circulating in infected individuals is about 2.7 h, and about 1012 particles are produced and cleared every day (Neumann et al., 1998, Ramratnam et al., 1999). A typical active HBV infection can produce 1013 viral particles per day; with an average mutation rate of 10\u22124 mutations per nucleotide, 109 new mutations can be tested every day in the 3200 bp HBV genome (Whalley et al., 2001) (review in Quer et al., 2008). Thus, replication of some important viral pathogens is extremely rapid; viruses undergo continuous genetic change and are constantly replaced by new variants (rapid turnover). Genetic and phenotypic diversification is fast and observable. This has been directly noticed in the case of HIV-1 upon the reconstruction of the genomic nucleotide sequence of the transmitted (or founder) virus in a number of patients (Keele et al., 2008, Salazar-Gonzalez et al., 2009). These studies revealed a rapid diversification of the founder, biologically active HIV-1 into multiple replication-competent and defective progeny. There is little question that quasispecies dynamics, as defined in Chapter 3, is operating in vivo, and it implies an effective exploration of the permissive area of sequence space. Rapid, error-prone replication is the basis of virus behavior as r strategists, an adaptation to their long-term survival in heterogeneous environments.",

However, viruses can also establish latent infections with intermittent periods of virus production and intervals without detection of infectious virus. In latent infections by DNA viruses or retroviruses, the virus can be undetectable or present in minimal quantities until recurrence of the infection by activation of the latent reservoir takes place. Latency can occur with or without the integration of viral DNA into the host DNA. Chronic infections involve continuous but variable production of infectious virus, with or without disease manifestations that may become apparent only after prolonged chronicity. An acute infection can be followed by a persistent stage, sometimes producing highly mutated forms of the acute virus that give rise to new pathologies. This is the case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare brain disease associated with hypermutated variants of measles virus (Chapter 2).",

In contrast, in carrier cell cultures, there is a continuous supply of a small number of uninfected cells that engage in a sustained, low-level viral production. Persistent infections in cell culture have been instrumental to learn about the consequences of virus-host cell interactions, and they are studied in Chapter 6.",

Persistent infections by Borna disease virus (BDV) are particularly illustrative because as little as 0.01\u20130.05 infectious units are present per infected cell (Pauli and Ludwig, 1985). This behavior may relate to the frequent occurrence of asymptomatic infection of several animal species by this unique viral pathogen (de la Torre, 2002). Limited Bornavirus replication may also explain its relative evolutionary stasis in some hosts, while its rate of evolution and extent of diversification appear to be larger among newly described avian bornaviruses (ABVs) (Philadelpho et al., 2014), with 17-fold higher substitution rates for ABV than the mammal-infecting BDV (He et al., 2014). A requirement of rapid replication is not universal for the different lifestyles exhibited by viruses.",

            "text": "The maintenance of a large population size of viruses in cytolytic or acute infections in vivo is conditioned to the absence of population bottlenecks (strong reductions in population size that can alter the course of selective events, as discussed in Chapter 3) (Fig. 4.1\n). Bottlenecks have been characterized during viral transmission from an infected into a susceptible host, and also within infected hosts (Foy et al., 2004, Scholle et al., 2004, Quer et al., 2005, Ali et al., 2006, Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2006, Kuss et al., 2008, Smith et al., 2008, Haaland et al., 2009, Bull et al., 2011, Domingo et al., 2012, Gutierrez et al., 2012, Forrester et al., 2014). As emphasized by S. Gutierrez, S. Blanc, and colleagues, a variety of population bottleneck sizes is probably encountered during virus-host interactions (Gutierrez et al., 2012). Aerosols produced by an infected individual can spread a very small proportion of the total number of infectious particles, thus representing strong bottleneck restrictions (estimates were reported in Artenstein and Miller, 1966, Gerone et al., 1966; see also Clarke et al., 1994 and Chapter 6 for the effect of serial bottlenecks, as assessed in laboratory experiments). Bottlenecks are also intense when an infection is initiated through contact with small volumes of secretions or excretions. Different evolutionary outcomes can be expected when a virus is transmitted through a small or large amount of infected fluids, for example, sharing a syringe versus a transfusion with contaminated blood in the case of HIV-1 or HCV when blood screening for these viruses had not been implemented (Shepard et al., 2005, Sharma and Sherker, 2009, De Cock et al., 2012). Not only the probability of infection is higher when a susceptible individual is exposed to a large amount of contaminated fluid, but a massive amount of initial virus facilitates the adaptation of the quasispecies to the recipient host, by providing multiple initial genomes from which to initiate adaptive walks.",

Aphids transmit an average of 0.5-5 virus particles into the recipient plant host, a range of values that is very similar to that estimated for HIV-1, with evidence that in about 75% of HIV-1-infected patients a single founder genome initiated the infection while in the others a minimum of two to five viruses was involved (Keele et al., 2008). In other cases, no severe transmission bottlenecks or major barriers for dissemination seem to operate during intrahost virus expansion (Murcia et al., 2010, Erickson and Pfeiffer, 2013) (Fig. 4.2\n). Additional studies are needed to elucidate how variations in population size can affect evolutionary outcomes in viruses. Deep sequencing should provide new insights toward the consequence of bottlenecks for the genetic heterogeneity of viral populations (see Section 4.10 on bottlenecks during the arbovirus life cycle).",

N\ne in virology was adopted from a concept initially introduced by S. Wright in population genetics to mean the number of breeding individuals, and therefore, the number of the total N that contributes to the next generation. It is considered important to evaluate the variability in a population and the relative participation of selection and random drift in evolution (Charlesworth, 2009).

Measurements of N\ne for HIV-1 have yielded values that range from 103 to 106 (Rouzine et al., 2014). There are at least two reasons to account for the fact that not all viral particles present in an infected individual are replicating to produce infectious progeny at any given time: (i) despite all infectious virus being potentially replication-competent, for stochastic reasons not all of them make their way into a susceptible cell. (ii) A proportion of viral particles that are counted in virus censuses based on quantification of genetic material are intrinsically noninfectious (they could not infect despite having available permissive host cells). The reasons for defectiveness are multiple, encompassing genetic lesions, and virion assembly defects. It is very difficult to estimate the proportion of defective viruses in the different host compartments in which replication takes place. Regarding transmission, it means that when one to four particles are transmitted (external rectangles in Fig. 4.1) some particles may be defective or unfit, thus contributing to possible unproductive infections. Viral N and N\ne values may vary locally in different tissues and organs, rendering the interest of the actual N\ne value highly dependent on the purpose of the determination (i.e., during viremia to interpret the neutralizing activity of circulating antibodies, or in a specific host compartment to evaluate pathogenic consequences of the infection or the probability of generation of mutants resistant to an inhibitor). The distinction between N and N\ne has been attempted with a few virus-host systems (Gutierrez et al., 2012, Rouzine et al., 2014, and references therein). In the cases in which estimates of N\ne have been obtained, the values are such that both selection and random drift can influence the evolutionary outcomes. For all these reasons, in the present book, we refer only to virus population size, without attempting a distinction between N and N\ne. The interpretation of several observations related to differences in population size that will be discussed in Chapters 5 and 6Chapter 5Chapter 6\nis not critically dependent on such a distinction, further justifying our simplification, despite acknowledging the relevance of N\ne for nonviral systems, and in some particular cases for virus evolution (for example, the population size version that contributes to fitness gain during viral replication; Chapter 5).",

From the molecular mechanisms and the building blocks available at the different evolutionary periods, viruses have attained a viable solution as autonomous, cell-dependent, genetic elements. A viral genome was shaped by natural selection acting on phenotypes that were the result of transfers of functional modules, duplication of genomic regions, constellations of mutations acting in concert, and other molecular events that changed the genetic materials. It is not easy to partially dismantle the coordinated set of elements without destroying the replicative capacity of the construct. The requirement of a finely tuned assemblage of elements introduces what we refer to as basal constraints. Their existence at multiple structural and functional levels has become more and more evident as knowledge of the molecular biology of viruses has progressed. This is one of the reasons why synonymous mutations are not necessarily neutral, as justified in Chapter 2, and why manipulation of viral genomes in the laboratory (changes of gene order, construction of chimeric viruses, codon deoptimizations, etc.) generally results in fitness decrease or even lethality.",

A virus will endure a fitness cost as a result of having confronted a selective constraint successfully (as illustrated with specific examples in Chapters 5 and 8Chapter 5Chapter 8), and a universal optimization is highly unlikely. Application of the \u201cno free lunch\u201d theorem to complexity theory is currently under investigation regarding its applicability to biological processes, such as genetic optimization algorithms (Whitley and Watson, 2005, Manning et al., 2013, Buenno et al., 2015, Popovici, 2018). Data of viral RNA and protein functions suggest that due to the extremely compact biological information imprinted into a physically small genome, each nucleotide is exploited for multiple functions, even those nucleotides that do not belong to overlapping genes (alternative open-reading frames with two different proteins encoded in part by the same nucleotide sequence). As a consequence, possible neutral sites (\u201cneutral\u201d meaning that their modification does not entail any functional difference) are probably very rare, as explained in Chapters 2 and 3Chapter 2Chapter 3. Some sites may be referred to as neutral only in the sense that a modification in them still allows the virus to survive.

Application of microarray hybridization analysis to quantitate the alteration of host gene expression during viral infections typically shows upregulation or downregulation of hundreds of host genes. Testing the influence of cellular functions by RNAi (interference) screens often reveals unsuspected effects of host gene products in virus replication, even when appropriate controls to exclude off-target effects of the interfering RNAs are used. Part of the host modifications in gene expression observed in infected cells may be just the indirect consequence of other cellular perturbations, and thus, they may not be essential to the progression of the infection. However, the massive response of collectivities of genes illustrates the multiple connections that a replicating virus establishes with cells and suggests that disarrangements of some cellular functions lead to other (perhaps compensatory) changes in the cells. Viruses are structurally and functionally deeply integrated into the cells in which they replicate, in line with theories of virus origins that favor long-term coexistence of viral elements with precellular and primitive cell organizations (Chapter 1).",

Long-term coevolution of host organisms and their viruses must have contributed to the survival of both (Woolhouse et al., 2002, Switzer et al., 2005, Villarreal, 2005).

Viruses do not have an evolutionary history of confrontation with man-made antiviral agents, and nevertheless, viruses can overcome the effect of this class of inhibitors. This reflects that viruses have evolved survival mechanisms of such a general nature (basically the different genetic variation strategies described in Chapter 2) that they constitute a flexible \u201ctool-box\u201d ready for contingencies. One of the major problems in antiviral therapy is the selection of viral mutants resistant to drugs used in therapy. There is virtually no antiviral agent for which no resistance mutations have been described. In fact, the capacity of a drug to select resistant mutants has been traditionally considered a proof of the selectivity of the drug (Herrmann and Herrmann, 1977). Although many studies on inhibitor-resistant mutants have involved HIV-1, HBV, and HCV infections, all viruses respond to specific antiviral agents by selecting escape mutants, as described in Chapter 8. Remarkably, different mutations in the same viral genes may determine resistance to, or dependence on, an antiviral agent (de la Torre et al., 1990, Baldwin et al., 2004, Baldwin and Berkhout, 2007, and references therein). This adaptive flexibility is obviously of great practical relevance, and it has encouraged the exploration of new antiviral strategies that aim at avoiding selection of virus mutants resistant to antiviral agents (Chapter 9).",

Some mutations have been termed quasisynonymous because, despite not leading to an amino acid replacement, they can affect the evolutionary course (Salemi and Vandamme, 2004). As an example, there are six triplets that encode the amino acid R (Arg), and they all have a G in the middle position (AGG, AGA, CGG, CGA, CGC, CGU); out of these, only two (AGG and CGG) are within a one nucleotide distance from W (Trp) (UGG); transversion A \u2192 U is required to change the triplet AGG (R) to UGG (W), and transition C \u2192 U is required to change CGG (R) to UGG (W). The only triplet encoding W (UGG) is within a single nucleotide distance from two termination codons (UGA and UAG) (Fig. 4.4\n). Thus, a difference in the R codons that a virus uses is not a neutral trait since two of them are within a one nucleotide distance of the codon for W, which in turn is at one nucleotide distance of two termination (stop) codons. The latter may be reached as a result of increased mutational pressure, either due to a decrease of polymerase fidelity or to antiviral lethal mutagenesis treatments (Chapter 9). A strategy to attenuate virus consists in engineering triplets at one mutation distance from a stop codon, or expressed more generally, in transferring genomes to unfavorable regions of sequence space (Moratorio et al., 2017, Moratorio and Vignuzzi, 2018).",

Nonstructural proteins (those that are not present in the viral particles) and regulatory regions in viral genomes may also mediate cellular tropism and host range changes in viruses. Deletions and point mutations in the nonstructural protein 3A of FMDV have been associated with attenuation for cattle (reviewed in Baranowski et al., 2003). A single amino acid substitution in 3A was critical for the adaptation of a swine FMDV to guinea pig (N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 2001) (Fig. 4.7\n). Despite the conservation of the LTR of a macrophage-tropic strain of the lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) in vivo, the stepwise generation of a new transcription factor-binding motif within the enhancer element was associated with the expansion of tropism to endothelial cells and fibroblasts (Maury et al., 2005). A comparison of the minimal promoter-enhancer element of HIV-1 of clades B, C, and E, engineered into the same SIV genetic background, indicated that this element could modulate viral replication in different cell subsets in vivo (Centlivre et al., 2005, Sala et al., 2006). Polymorphism in the binding sites of transcription factors is probably involved in differential expression of HIV-1 clades in different tissues. The polymerase genes of IV may influence host range, and probably, gene constellations affect the relative replication capacity of viruses in different hosts (Parrish and Kawaoka, 2005).",

Cell dynamics can exert an important influence on short-term virus evolution and pathogenesis (See Chapter 6 for a description of the dependence on host cell variation for the initiation of persistent infection of FMDV in cell culture).

Any virus whose capacity to expand cell tropism was limited by genetic constraints (e.g., the need to move to long distances in sequence space, incompatible with viral population numbers) would have a lower probability of long-term survival in an increasingly differentiated cellular world. A large virus population size is the key to provide a sufficient number of variants with new potential cell recognition specificities. That is, the application of the Darwinian principles to the long-term evolution of viruses is expected to have produced a flexible virus-host cell interaction in the sense that it may be modified by a limited genetic change in the virus.",

Coevolution is a general concept that applies not only to host-parasite relationships but also to other interacting biological species that have shaped biological systems up to the present epoch (Futuyma and Slatkin, 1983, Woolhouse et al., 2002, Gomez et al., 2015). Long-term coevolution has probably led to increasingly subtle molecular mechanisms to deal with the host immune response, based on virus-coded proteins that interact with host proteins. In addition, mutual evolutionary influences may be exerted among different sites within a virus. Such influences are favored by overlaps between domains involved in distinct functions in viral nucleic acids or proteins that may also introduce additional evolutionary constraints. Coevolution of amino acids at or around important functional domains may contribute to functional stability (Gloor et al., 2005). Homologous structure analyses can be applied to identify functional residues in proteins (Du et al., 2016). Intramolecular coevolution can be measured for amino acid pairs by the probability of their occurrence at some defined positions, also termed mutual information criterion (MIC) (Korber et al., 1993).",

As mentioned in Section 4.2.2, the FMDV capsid includes an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) triplet at an exposed mobile loop in protein VP1 (Acharya et al., 1989, Fry and Stuart, 2010) which is involved in the binding of neutralizing antibodies and in recognition of integrin receptors (Verdaguer et al., 1995). Functional alterations in FMDV can be interpreted as a consequence of the overlap between a major antigenic site and the integrin recognition domain: variants selected with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies displayed altered integrin recognition (Martinez et al., 1997, Baranowski et al., 2000, Ruiz-Jarabo et al., 2004). Adaptation of FMDV to cell culture may result in antigenic variation and in the use of heparan sulfate as a molecule that facilities virus entry; some of the residues involved in heparin-binding map at antigenic sites (Curry et al., 1996, Sa-Carvalho et al., 1997, Fry et al., 1999, Baranowski et al., 2000). Cattle that were partially immunized with synthetic peptides, representing the VP1 loop sequence, selected FMDV mutants with substitutions within the RGD or at neighboring sites.

            "text": "Studies with IVs have shown several consequences of the close connection between antigenic and receptor interaction sites. HA antigenic variants were selected upon egg adaptation of the virus (Robertson et al., 1987). Treatment with antibodies resulted in the selection of variants with altered receptor binding (Laeeq et al., 1997). The hemagglutinating activity of type C IV can be modulated by amino acid residues involved in antibody binding (Matsuzaki et al., 1992). Passage of this virus in MHV-II cells resulted in antigenic variants that displayed an advantage in receptor binding (Umetsu et al., 1992). The receptor-binding specificity of IV can modify the antigenic profile of the virus as analyzed by the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies with the HA (Yamada et al., 1984). The mutual influence between antigenic variation and receptor site modifications has been extended to recent IV isolates (Koel et al., 2013, Koel et al., 2014). These summarized accounts for FMDV and IV, in addition to the studies listed in Table 4.2, Table 4.3 provide incontestable evidence that antigenic changes, which are extremely frequent because of the continuous confrontation of viruses with antibodies, may contribute to the modification of cell-binding preferences.",

            "text": "Two facts facilitate antigenicity-cell tropism coevolution: (i) the limited number of amino acid substitutions, and hence of mutations, that are needed for an antigenic change (one of the parameters that render the quasispecies nature of viruses biologically relevant; see Box 3.3 and text in Chapter 3). (ii) surface residues tend to be less constrained structurally than internal residues in viral capsids or envelopes. Their tolerance to accept amino acid substitutions is one of the mechanisms of antigenic variation in the absence of immune selection (Section 4.7). Surface residues appear as the most variable when all the historically recorded substitutions are depicted on the three-dimensional structures of viral particles. In the case of FMDV high variability of surface amino acids has been corroborated with several virion structures determined by D. Stuart, E. Fry, D. Rowlands and their colleagues (one of the comparisons between two isolates of a subtype and an antigenic variant is described in Lea et al., 1995). Conformational antigenic sites, similarly to internal capsid residues, are involved in interactions, which may be necessary for virion stability, and therefore, their tolerance of amino acid substitutions is more restricted than in linear, continuous epitopes. This is the case with discontinuous epitopes that have been characterized within antigenic site D2 of FMDV. The conformation of this site in FMDV O1BFS and C1 is conserved despite different primary sequences. The substitutions in antibody-escape mutants of D2 map in amino acids which are not involved in interactions with surrounding residues. Significantly, the only substitution found in a residue involved in hydrogen bonding led to an amino acid that maintained the hydrogen bond with the same neighbor amino acid, according to the modeling of the change based on crystallographic data (Lea et al., 1994). Epitope plasticity may allow antibody escape while maintaining the interaction with cellular ligands (Lindesmith et al., 2019). It is expected that disordered protein regions free of structural constraints can tolerate amino acid substitutions. In some cases, surprisingly, even a viral polymerase may contain domains that can be extensively changed and remain functional (Gitlin et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Viruses use two major strategies to cope with the host response: modulation and escape. Modulation consists of the expression of viral gene products that by any mechanism can alter the components of the immune response. The consequence is to facilitate virus survival to increase the probability of transmission, or virus persistence in the infected organism. The escape strategy is based on the exploitation of mutations in the viral genome that confer the virus increased resistance to inactivation by components of the immune response. Amino acid substitutions may prevent neutralization of viral particles by antibodies or elimination of infected cells by specific cytotoxic T cells. Both modulation and escape strategies are exploited by DNA and RNA viruses, although complex DNA viruses encode several proteins whose primary function is to interfere with the host defense mechanisms. They include homologues of cytokines, chemokines, viral proteins that act as a decoy for antiviral antibodies, proteins that block complement activation, that suppress MHC class I and II molecules, that interfere with ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, that induce or inhibit apoptosis, among other proteins and activities (Alcami, 2003, Seet et al., 2003, Rustagi and Gale, 2014). Viral proteins block interferon induction (i.e., influenza virus NS1, Ebola virus P35, and others) (Basler and Garcia-Sastre, 2002, Katze et al., 2002, Weber et al., 2004). Some of the proteins involved provide remarkable examples of protein multifunctionality. The leader L proteinase of FMDV catalyzes its own cleavage from the polyprotein, cleaves the host cell translation factor eIF4G\u2014leading to the shutoff of host cell translation dependent on capped mRNAs\u2014and inhibits IFN induction in the infected cells (de Los Santos et al., 2006). HIV-1 Nef contributes to HIV-1 evasion of immune surveillance through interaction with membrane traffic regulators (Pawlak and Dikeakos, 2015). Several additional multifunctional viral proteins one of whose roles has an impact on the host antiviral response have been described.",

Rather than being a secondary phenomenon in the course of viral infections, the generation of antibody- and CTL escape mutants may indeed contribute to viral persistence (Gebauer et al., 1988, Ciurea et al., 2000, Richman et al., 2003, Domingo, 2006). Evasion of an immune response, as the outcome of a selection event in viruses, may entail a fitness cost. Such a cost may bring about reversion to the initial sequences when selective forces (antibodies or CTLs) are no longer present (Borrow et al., 1997).

            "text": "There is an important difference between the selective constraint imposed by antiviral drugs and by the host immune response. While drugs inhibit a specific step of the virus replication cycle (or two or more steps if two or multiple drugs are administered simultaneously), the immune response gives rise to multiple constraints that act upon the virus. As an example, 100 HCV passages in cell culture in the presence of IFN-\u03b1 were necessary to select HCV mutants displaying significant resistance to IFN-\u03b1 (Perales et al., 2013). The resistant HCV exhibited higher fitness than the populations passaged in the absence of IFN-\u03b1 when fitness was measured in the presence of IFN-\u03b1, but not in its absence. Sequence analysis documented that amino acid substitutions that contributed to resistance were present in most viral proteins, and many substitutions differed among parallel viral lineages (Perales et al., 2013). It is expected that viruses find higher genetic and phenotypic barriers for responding to multicomponent antiviral responses than to a single inhibitor with a defined target (Perales et al., 2014). A high genetic barrier is due to the requirement of multiple mutations, while a high phenotypic barrier reflects the fitness cost inflicted by the mutations once they have been selected. The fact that IFN-\u03b1 resistance requires several amino acid substitutions implies a high barrier to resistance since each of the substitutions may affect a multifunctional protein. The observations with HCV in cell culture agree with multiple possible IFN-\u03b1-resistance mutations identified in clinical practice, thus providing an interpretation of the absence of a catalog of IFN-\u03b1-resistance mutations that are available for other HCV inhibitors [reviewed in (Perales et al., 2014, Perales, 2018)].",

(ii) Not mutually exclusive with the previous mechanism, selective forces other than an immune response may result in amino acid replacements at antigenic sites (as in coevolution of receptor recognition specificity and antigenicity, discussed in Section 4.5). Antigenic variation may follow from the hitchhiking of mutations that encode amino acid substitutions at antigenic sites, following selection sweeps (Chapter 3) (Fig. 4.8\n). Therefore, a consequence of quasispecies dynamics is that amino acid substitutions observed at the antigenic sites of viruses are not necessarily the result of immune selection.",

Even assuming that high replication rate was a general need for viruses, it would be a case of trait coadaptation. The necessity of viruses to periodically respond to complex (multiple) selective constraints suggests that high mutation rates have been positively selected (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005, Vignuzzi et al., 2006). To my knowledge, there is no evidence that persistent viruses\u2014that in most cases would benefit from a limited replication rate\u2014have selected high fidelity mutants in nature or the laboratory. Error-prone replication is maintained after prolonged viral persistence despite mutation rate being an evolvable trait and that copying fidelity can be modulated by proteins other than the polymerase (Section 4.9). Following a population bottleneck, an event which from all evidence is very frequent (Section 4.1.2) a single infectious virus must repopulate a mutant spectrum to provide a range of phenotypes that can mediate adaptation. A selective advantage over mutants that cannot provide a comparable phenotypic repertoire can be anticipated (Vignuzzi and Andino, 2010). Mutant viruses displaying altered template-copying fidelity generally exhibit lower fitness than their standard parental genomes. Therefore, current evidence favors the view that the observed mutation rate values are of benefit to the survival strategies employed by viruses, and probably a consequence of their evolutionary adaptation to changing environments.",

Mutations in FMDV 2C can modulate the incorporation of nucleotides in the absence of mutations in the viral polymerase (Agudo et al., 2016). 2C is the target of guanidine hydrochloride, a protein-denaturing agent that at low concentrations is an inhibitor of picornavirus replication.

            "text": "Multifunctionality of viral proteins has several implications for the modulation of host cell functions during infections, virus evolution, viral genome stability, and the response of viruses to selective constraints. An amino acid substitution in a viral protein needed to overcome a specific selective pressure directed to that protein may also affect unrelated functions performed by the protein. This may result in a fitness cost, frequently observed with viral mutants selected for their capacity to overcome an inhibitory activity. When the selected mutants are allowed to continue their replication, additional mutations may occur to increase fitness. Involvement in two or more functions may limit the number of possible amino acid substitutions that a protein can accept for fitness increase, because the same substitutions that may compensate for a limitation of one of the functions may adversely affect other functions exerted by the same protein. Again, trade-offs (the virus modus vivendi) enter the picture (Section 4.2). Restrictions imposed by multifunctionality may underlie the observation that a single amino acid replacement I248T in protein 2C was selected repeatedly and independently when FMDV had to respond to different environmental demands: in the course of adaptation of a biological clone of the virus to guinea pig (N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 2001), upon replication of the same clone in mice (Sanz-Ramos et al., 2008), or to modulate the relative rate of incorporation of different nucleotides by the FMDV polymerase (Agudo et al., 2016). Substitutions that serve a virus to increase its fitness under different environmental circumstances are termed \u201cjoker\u201d substitutions. They lead to a general increase in replication efficiency under different environmental demands.",

A reason for the limited differences in conservation of these two categories of coding regions may lie in protein multifunctionality, in combination with the phenotypic involvement of the viral RNA itself, independent of its coding function (Section 4.3 and Chapter 2). Indeed, if the same protein performs different functions and the RNA is also involved in regulatory activities, each nucleotide may be subjected to constraints that may not differ significantly from the constraints operating on the products expressed from overlapping genes (Domingo et al., 2012).",

Instead, viruses are transmitted among plants either via nematodes in the soil or flying insects [compilation in (Hogenhout et al., 2013)]. Virus particles have to survive during the process of insect-mediated transmission, an adaptation that has probably been shaped over the 300 million years since the first insects evolved. A surprising array of plant-insect-virus interactions has been described, with the exploitation of biochemical pathways that at the organism level rival with the adaptations attained by mutant spectra of the infecting viruses at the molecular level. In some cases, infected vectors are attracted to noninfected plants while uninfected vectors are attracted to infected plants, as a result of molecular signals whose result is the enhancement virus transmission (Mauck et al., 2010, Carr et al., 2018). Virus factories and the transmission body of cauliflower mosaic virus can reversibly disassemble to enhance virion distribution, and favor aphid-mediated transmission (Bak et al., 2013). A true arms race and coevolutionary events at many levels are established among viruses, their host plants, and terrestrial or air-borne insect vectors, to achieve the survival of all participants.",

            "text": "Virus population numbers are orders of magnitude greater than the numbers of individuals in the host species that they infect. Large population numbers, however, are not constant during the virus life cycles. Viruses undergo periodic bottleneck events, that is, drastic reductions in population size as they spread within individual hosts and during host-to-host transmission. Bottlenecks accentuate the effect of chance (that promotes genetic drift) in virus evolution, made more severe by the mutant spectrum (cloud) nature of viral populations. Out of the large mutant repertoire that is produced during an infection, bottlenecks dictate that only a minority contributes to the next round of progeny production either in the same host (because of a change of compartment) or in a different host individual. It is unlikely that two bottleneck transmissions will involve the same genome repertoire, even when applied to the same population. Bottlenecks also result in transient reductions of population heterogeneity (a decrease in the amplitude of mutant spectra) because only a few founder viral particles will originate the progeny repertoire, and the latter necessitates some replication rounds to restore the population size and complexity that the population had prior to the bottleneck. It has been suggested that one of the reasons why high mutation rates are maintained in viruses is the need to reinstate population heterogeneity following a population bottleneck. This proposal is in line with the adaptive value of complex mutant spectra documented in Chapters 2 and 3Chapter 2Chapter 3. Despite several models on the evolutionary origins of high mutation rates, current evidence favors that high mutation rates of RNA viruses (and some DNA viruses) serve the adaptive needs of viruses; virtually, every chapter of this book includes examples.",

Still, other constraints are the result of human intervention such as vaccination or the administration of antiviral drugs. Emphasis has been put on codon usage and codon-pair associations as a basal constraint for virus replication, for two reasons.

Yet, successful creatures can lack consciousness and can have a short neck; some viruses that have survived to our times have a labile capsid.

The studies on evasion strategy, based on the selection of antibody- and CTL-resistant mutants, have been instrumental for the understanding of quasispecies dynamics. Viruses can use several receptors that belong to different families of cell surface proteins that mediate virus internalization. Viruses display remarkable flexibility to modify their cell target preference. Alterations of cell tropism and coevolution of antigenicity and receptor recognition specificity have been outlined as a consequence of quasispecies dynamics and the overlap between antigenic sites and receptor-recognition domains in viruses. The adaptability of a viral quasispecies is also reflected in the capacity of viruses to confront changing and alternating selective pressures. The arboviruses that alternate between insect and vertebrate or plant hosts constitute an example of adaptation to multiple hosts as a standard way of life, although to some extent any virus must confront different environments (see Summary Box).Summary Box\n\u2022Virus population numbers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of their host organisms.\u2022Viruses are subjected to constraints at multiple levels that limit their replication and contribute to maintaining their biological identity.\u2022Viruses exploit a variety of molecular mechanisms to overcome external constraints, such as therapeutic interventions.\u2022Codon usage and codon-pair frequencies represent constraints for viral gene expression that can be used to design new generation vaccines.\u2022Viruses can modify their cellular tropisms through amino acid substitutions in surface protein residues and other mechanisms.
