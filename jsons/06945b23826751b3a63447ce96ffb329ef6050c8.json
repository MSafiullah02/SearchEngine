CQ and HCQ are well known to ophthalmologists because of retinal toxicity after long-term usage for systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatoid diseases. Retinopathy Q3 is seen infrequently before 10 or more years of usage at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommended dosage of <5 mg/kg real weight. 4 However, the doses proposed to treat COVID-19 are 4-5 times higher, and it is important that our specialty be informed whether there is ocular risk from these shortterm treatments. Do we need to be worried, and what, if anything, should ophthalmology be doing?",

Some rheumatologists have been giving 1,200 mg/day for 6 weeks as a loading dose when starting HCQ therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus, and no visual losses have been reported, although detailed ophthalmologic examinations were not performed. 5, 6 Two trials of treatment of myeloma and solid tumors used 1,200 mg/day for 4-8 weeks, and again no visual loss was reported. 7, 8 The only high-dose ophthalmologic study by Leung and associates 9 followed 7 patients at 3-month intervals for 7-25 months while using 1,000 mg/day HCQ therapy for small-cell lung cancer. By patient weight, these doses were 3-5 times greater than that recommended by the AAO. Two patients developed subtle and suggestive changes on optical coherence tomography in the parafoveal ellipsoid zone after 11 and 17 months and definitive toxicity after 15 and 25 months. None of the other patients showed damage. Thus, evidence to date indicates that extreme doses do accelerate retinal toxicity but with a probable time course of many months rather than days.",

However, as new protocols arise, these steps will need to be evaluated relative to the risk of retinopathy that their particular doses and durations of use may pose. Ophthalmologists will be most effective in this time of crisis by reassuring physicians and the public where retinopathy is not a serious concern with respect to CQ or HCQ usage for coronavirus. ---2020 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY   111  112  113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168  169  170  171  172  173  174  175  176  177   178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244 ",
