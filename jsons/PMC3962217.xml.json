            "text": "Classically, autophagy has been defined as a eukaryotic system for degradation of cellular material inside the lysosome. The best-studied form, macroautophagy, encapsulates the cytoplasmic material inside a double-membrane vesicle, the autophagosome that fuses with the lysosome. Once considered a nonselective bulk process, autophagy is now appreciated as a way to quickly respond to shifting cellular conditions and to selectively degrade damaged organelles, proteins, nucleic acids, and pathogens. Interest in autophagy has surged in the past five years and is now seen as a therapeutic target in many diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infectious disease [1\u20133], where not just host autophagy but that of the eukaryotic pathogen plays a critical role in infection [4]. While much was known about the role of autophagy in the protozoans Leishmania, Trypanosoma, and Toxoplasma\n[5\u20137], the story was less conclusive for the malaria parasite Plasmodium, which kills nearly one million people each year [8], as well as the related species, Theileria and Eimeria. However, great advances have been made in the last year.",

They conducted extensive studies showing increased pigment clumping in \u201cautophagic vacuoles\u201d following chloroquine (CQ) treatment in blood stage parasites [9, 10]. In the 2000s, drug treatment was again reported to induce autophagic vacuoles and an autophagic death [11, 12]. However, Klionsky, a leading researcher in autophagy, has warned against the visualization of autophagosomes through electron microscopy as the sole evidence for an autophagic process [13]. The difficulty in culturing certain stages of the parasite, genetically manipulating the organism to make conditional knockouts, and to clone and express genes recombinantly all have contributed to a void of knowledge in this area. The last year witnessed a vast expansion in our understanding of autophagic pathways in the Plasmodium parasite.",

            "text": "Although over 30 AuTophaGy (Atg) proteins have been identified in yeast, not all are essential to macroautophagy (Figure 1). Autophagy induction in yeast (and mammals) begins with the Atg1 (ULK1 in mammals) protein kinase complex, which is inhibited by the target of rapamycin, TORC1 (mTOR in mammals) complex under homeostasis. Nutrient deprivation or rapamycin treatment alleviates the negative regulation on the Atg1 (ULK1) complex [18]. Atg1 and Atg13 form a complex with Atg31/Atg17/Atg29/Atg11 in yeast and FIP200/Atg101 in mammals at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) [19, 20]. Atg17 has been implicated as the most upstream scaffold for protein recruitment to the PAS [21]. Phosphorylation of substrates by Atg1 (ULK1) activates the Phosphatidyl-Inositol 3-phosphate Kinase (PI3K) class III complex, composed of Vps34, Atg14, Vps15/p150, and Atg6 (Beclin1 in mammals) which converts phosphatidylinositol (PI) into phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PI(3)P) at the site of the PAS [22]. This creates a binding site for Atg18 (WIPIs in mammals) and Atg2 at the isolation membrane, also requiring association with the transmembrane protein Atg9 [23]. Elongation of the membrane and closure of the autophagosome requires covalent attachment of the C-terminal glycine of Atg8 (LC3 in mammals) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the phagophore membrane [24]. Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) that requires the protease Atg4, an E1-activating enzyme, Atg7, and an E2-conjugating enzyme, Atg3 for lipidation [25, 26]. Another autophagy Ubl protein, Atg12, is covalently attached to Atg5, requiring Atg7 as well, and its own E2, Atg10 [27]. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate forms a complex with Atg16 to drastically increase conjugation of Atg8, presumably by forming a scaffold with Atg3 at the membrane [28]. The autophagosome seals and fuses with endocytic compartments and the lysosome, where the material is broken down and recycled back to the cytoplasm.\\",

The coordination of events in macroautophagy is diagrammed in Figure 1, with putative homologues identified in Plasmodium colored in black and less reliable identifications in gray. Although several hits were identified for the nutrient sensor TOR, these hits have clearer homology to Phosphatidyl-Inositol 4-Kinases. Of the proteins involved in autophagy induction, Atg1 and its mammalian binding partners, FIP200 and Atg101 appear to have orthologues in Plasmodium, while Atg13 appears absent. The C-terminal Atg13-binding domain is also missing from PfAtg1. It contains several potential Atg8-interacting motifs, which mediate Atg1 binding to Atg8 in an Atg13-independent manner in yeast and humans [32]. PfVps34 exists in P. falciparum and is one of the better-characterized proteins. Vps15 and Atg14, also members of the PI3K complex were identified, but Atg6 was not.",

All members of the phylum Apicomplexa, with the exception of Cryptospiridium, contain apicoplasts, plastid organelles analogous to chloroplasts in plants, acquired through endosymbiosis. The organelle is essential to Plasmodium survival in both asexual stages and is the site for synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, isoprenoids, and fatty acids [50]. Localization to other organelles, such as mitochondria, rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules was negative in the schizont, while transgenic Atg8 lacking the C-terminal glycine for lipidation showed diffuse localization, validating the results of these studies [30]. In hepatocytes, PbAtg8 localization along the apicoplast was observed 14 hours post-invasion and increased with organelle size throughout the liver stage [49].",

Recently, Atg8 has been observed on double-membrane vesicles near and inside the food vacuole, an acidic compartment that most likely serves as a lysosome in the parasite, providing intriguing evidence for macroautophagy [51]. Additionally, there is evidence of autophagic-like and distinct functions utilizing the autophagic machinery. The unique biology of the parasite as well as the adaptability of the machinery in other organisms for non-autophagic purposes makes alternative roles quite feasible and even likely [60]. Atg8's essentiality in Plasmodium is intriguing, as Atg8 knockouts are viable in yeast, which suggests an alternative or additional vital function(s) in the parasite [24]. In the highly related Apicomplexa, Toxoplasma, the E2 conjugating enzyme for TgAtg8, TgAtg3, is also essential [38]. Here we will present current thinking for the role of Atg8 and the autophagy machinery in Plasmodium, which is summarized in Figure 3.",

Plasmodium is encapsulated by a parasitopherous vacuole within host cells. Proteins targeted for export to the host cytosol or plasma membrane must be trafficked out of the parasite plasma membrane and the PV, necessitating novel pathways for protein secretion. It is possible that exophagy, where proteins inside autophagosomes are re-routed to the plasma membrane is involved [61]. Exophagy of Acb1 in yeast utilizes the autophagosomal machinery as well as GRASP65 and the t-SNARE, Sso1, which have putative homologues in Plasmodium\n[62, 63]. In the current model, autophagosomes fuse with multivesicular bodies to form amphisomes. Exophagy utilizes the COPII machinery but bypasses Golgi processing and is packaged into autophagosomes that fuse with plasma membrane [64].",

Vps34, also known as type III PI3K, is a lipid kinase at the ER that produces PI(3)P on the outer leaflet, important for recruitment of proteins to the phagophore and proper curvature of the autophagosome. PfVps34 purified from parasite lysate has kinase activity that can be inhibited by the well-characterized class III PI3K complex inhibitor, wortmannin. Endogenous PfVps34 localizes to the food vacuole and vesicular structures near the host plasma membrane in the blood stage, partially co-localizing with the VARC protein, a virulence factor in P. falciparum that is exported to the erythrocyte surface [59]. One of the more characterized routes of protein export beyond the PV utilizes a PEXEL motif for recognition. Recently, PI(3)P was shown to bind the PEXEL motif at PI(3)P-enriched regions in the ER [66].",

Treatment of Plasmodium sporozoites with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which targets Vps34, needed for PI(3)P production and phagophore formation, delays conversion into trophozoites [69].

A longstanding antimalarial, CQ accumulates in the food vacuole and prevents hemozoin dimerization and hemoglobin digestion [72], starving the parasite of amino acids. Varying responses are observed in Plasmodium upon CQ treatment and this appears to be due in part to the concentration that is used and the duration studied.

Extended incubation (12 hours) with 120 nM CQ leads to a build-up of hemoglobin-containing vesicles, likely by preventing fusion of these vesicles with the food vacuole, preventing hemoglobin digestion and starving the parasite of amino acids [74]. Sinai and Roepe report drastic re-localization of PfAtg8 from the parasite to the RBC host cytoplasm with either prolonged starvation or high cytocidal concentrations of CQ [5].

The morphology of this cell death is similar to that observed in retinal pigment epithelial cells upon treatment with much higher concentrations (120 \u00b5M) of CQ and is thought to be the mechanism for retinotoxicity associated with CQ. In this case, they also did not see hallmarks of apoptosis but did see increased lipidation of LC3 to autophagic vacuoles (AVs) and a block in degradation of the autophagy-specific substrate, p62 [84]. Autophagic vacuoles were also observed in P. berghei blood stage parasites dying after treatment with dihydroartemisinin [12]. In this study, the authors concluded, \u201cSince the food vacuole membranes were affected, the nutrition of parasites was blocked and the autophagic vacuoles formed quickly as a result of amino-acid hunger of parasites.\u201d However distribution of Atg8 was not investigated.",

This was observed in cell culture and in mice, indicating it is a physiological mechanism. The process is restricted to the later stages of development. Eickel et al. observed double membrane structures that appeared similar to those reported by Meis and Verhave in 1985, then described as \u201cmembranous whorls\u201d [15]. Yet, fluorescence microscopy revealed that PbAtg8 never localized to these vesicular structures and remained associated with the apicoplast, determined by colocalization with ACP, and its organellar fragments throughout the cell death event [30]. Treatment with rapamycin (500 nM), which potently induces autophagy in yeast through inhibition of TOR, decreased parasite size and changed apicoplast morphology, but did not affect PbAtg8 localization. However, there is no known TOR orthologue in Plasmodium, and the observed effect on parasite growth could be mediated through off-target effects or effects on host autophagy [85]. The authors speculate that autophagy occurs in the parasite but is independent of Atg8. Although Atg8 is the canonical autophagic marker, there are reports of macroautophagy that is independent of LC3 conjugation [86]. However this alternative pathway requires ULK1, Rab9, and Beclin 1 and Rab9 and Beclin 1 orthologues have not been identified in Plasmodium.",

This does not require induction and occurs both in the liver and blood stage and most likely in the oocyst and sporozoite mosquito stages as well. This role most clearly explains PfAtg8 and Vps34's essential phenotype as autophagy would only be required under starvation conditions and protein trafficking to the membrane is most likely not essential, especially in in vitro conditions. During cases of extreme duress, such as starvation or drug treatment, the parasite induces an autophagic-like response that increases endocytosis of host cytoplasm and digestion in the food vacuole. If the stress conditions persist and the parasite cannot cope, the balance may be tipped to autophagic death. This may also be a mechanism to limit the number of parasites in the liver stage such that only the most robust parasites continue to the blood stage of infection. What little evidence exists suggests this cell death is independent of Atg8, but this remains to be further clarified [30].",

Transgenic PfAtg8 was not lipidated in mammalian cells, indicating PfAtg8 cannot complement the human homologue and PfAtg3 could not interact with human LC3 [36, 49]. We demonstrated that although PfAtg3 utilizes an Atg8-interacting motif similar to the human system, it also interacts through a short loop in PfAtg8 not present in humans [36]. Likely, other autophagy protein-protein interactions have similar divergences in their interaction surface and represent potential drug targets. The PfVps34 C-terminal region has 40% similarity and 23% identity to the human homologue but contains a substantial 1000 amino acid N-terminal extension with no known domain structure in Pfam. Perhaps its function at the apicoplast is mediated through this region?

In yeast, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling regulates Atg1 independent from TOR and may be a regulator in Plasmodium\n[93]. PfVps34 is phosphorylated in the parasite at a predicted PKA site [94]. PfeIK1, an orthologue for eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 kinase, has been implicated in the amino acid starvation response in Plasmodium and has been suggested as a possible mediator of autophagy induction [5, 95]. At this time, there are more questions than answers, but it is encouraging to see that the field embraces autophagy in apicomplexa as a highly interesting research area. It can be expected that progress towards intervening molecules will be made and these will further facilitate biological research questions.",
