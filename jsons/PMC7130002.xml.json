However, 1 \u03bcg of recombinant PPV NIa protease exhibited adequate activity for processing 50 \u03bcg of the substrate at 20 \u00b0C in 10 h. Considerable activity was observed at 4 \u00b0C, though activity was severely diminished at 40 \u00b0C (Fig. 5\na). At 40 \u00b0C, degradation of GFP after cleavage was observed when the cleaved products were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE; hence, high temperature is not recommended for the cleavage by PPV NIa protease. The initial velocity of recombinant PPV NIa protease at 30 \u00b0C were 1.21-fold and 1.79-fold of those at 4 and 40 \u00b0C, respectively.",

            "text": "The naturally accruing proteases can be grouped into four classes according to the prominent functional residue at the active site: Ser, Cys, Asp, and metal [36], [41]. NIa proteases from TEV, TVMV, and PPV are similar to trypsin-like serine proteases but adopt unconventional catalytic triad in which Cys replaces Ser [42]. There are many reagents that can inhibit the protease function irreversibly or reversibly. To test whether commonly used protease inhibitors can affect the behavior of recombinant PPV NIa protease, recombinant PPV NIa protease (1 \u03bcg) and the substrate sG (50 \u03bcg) were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 2 h, supplemented with different protease inhibitors. These protease inhibitors were used at high concentrations (even up to 100 times of their usual dosages). Only 1 mM PMSF had an effect, albeit slight, on the protease activity; other tested protease inhibitors (benzamidine, pepstatin A, aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and EDTA) had no effect on recombinant PPV NIa protease (Fig. 5c). Previous report showed human cystatin C affected PPV NIa protease activity in certain level when used at high concentration of 400 \u03bcg/ml [43]. In another way, the purified PPV NIa protease was not inhibited by other cystatins, such as oryzacystatins I and II (OCI and OCII), corn cystatin II (CCII), human stefin A (HSA), the domain 8 of tomato multicystatin (TMC-8) and a large 24 kDa tomato cystatin (LTCyst), when used at a molar ratio of 1:40 (NIa:cystatin) [39]. According to the detail manual of Devid S. Waugh laboratory (http://mcl1.ncifcrf.gov/waugh_research.html), TEV protease was not affected by PMSF (1 mM), AEBSF (1 mM), TLCK (1 mM), Bestatin (1 mg/ml), pepstatin A (1 mM), EDTA (1 mM) and E-64 (3 mg/ml), and a commercial \u201ccomplete\u201d protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), which is frequently used to inhibit serine-, cysteine-, and metallo- proteases, as well as calpains, of bacterial, mammalian, yeast, and plant cell extracts. However, zwitterionic detergent (APO-10, DDMAB, DODMG, FC-12, HECAMEG, LDAO, OG, and ZW 3\u201312) notably inhibited the proteolytic activity of rTEV [44]. We chose two common detergents, SDS (also working as a denaturing reagent) and Triton X-100, to test their effects on the activity of PPV NIa protease. As we can see from Fig. 5d, recombinant PPV NIa protease was very sensitive to SDS, losing most of its proteolytic activity in the presence of 0.05% SDS, whereas recombinant PPV NIa protease was quite tolerant to Triton X-100 (up to 2%). Another denaturing reagent, urea, had almost no affect on the performance of recombinant PPV NIa protease when used at a final concentration of 1 M. About 30% activity of recombinant PPV NIa protease was blocked by 2 M urea.",

However, it was reported that only MBP, but not GST or Trx, can improve the solubility of recombinant TEV NIa protease [45]. For achieving soluble product, recombinant TVMV NIa protease was also expressed as MBP-TVMV NIa fusion protein [29]. On another aspect, recombinant PPV NIa protease was resistant to auto-degradation for at least 5 days at 20 \u00b0C, which has not been shown before and it is a crucial factor for prolonged cleavage activity.

The recombinant PPV NIa proteases mentioned in this study was designed to be fused with 6\u00d7 His tags, therefore, the protease can be easily removed from reaction mixture by passing through a nickle affinity column after cleavage.

We found that recombinant PPV NIa protease was extremely specific toward the cleavage sequence; no processing of Trx tag, hexahistidine tag, S tag, GST tag (data not shown) and MBP tag (data not shown) was observed, even during overnight cleavage. We chose the naturally preferred site F [32], [37], [38] as the recognition sequence in fused substrates for recombinant PPV NIa protease. Two different substrates (sG and sN) with insertion of site F were both cleaved efficiently by recombinant PPV NIa protease, indicating the interaction between protease and substrate was highly specific and efficient in both cases. The corresponding sites F for TEV, TVMV, and PPV were E N L Y F Q\u25beS, E T V R F Q\u25beS, and N V V V H Q\u25beA, all adopting a conserved residue Gln in the P1 position [21], [29], [37]. The specificity of PPV NIa protease has been studied, mainly illustrating with anomalous proteolytic processing caused by mutated proteases or mutated substrates [31], [38], [49], [50], thus a further analysis of the specificity and efficiency of PPV NIa protease\u2013substrate complex by crystal structural is required. Although most studies about the cleavage determinant factors for NIa protease were performed with TEV and TVMV [20], [21], [33], [51], the high conserved amino acid sequence and function among PPV, TEV, and TVMV NIa protease indicate the recognition mechanism of TEV and TVMV NIa protease may also fit for PPV NIa protease [52]. The crystal structures of TEV and TVMV NIa protease suggested that the S4 and S3 pockets are primarily responsible for their different sequence specificities and that the residues in the P3 and P4 positions of the cleavage sites are the most important specificity discriminators [21].",

In addition, denaturing reagents and detergents were often required in the purification of insoluble or organellic proteins. The recombinant PPV NIa protease was sensitive to 0.05% SDS, but it was tolerant to both 2% Triton X-100 and 1 M urea. Comparatively, a commercial protease factor Xa (Cat. No. 69036-3, Novagen) is sensitive to urea, SDS, and high salt concentration (above 250 mM). The enzymatic ability of recombinant PPV NIa protease is similar to that reported by TVMV and TEV NIa protease with respect to molar ratio of protease and substrate [29], [53]. All the data indicates recombinant PPV NIa protease is a promising universal tool for fusion tags removal.",

Intracellular self-cleavage by TEV NIa protease on fusion protein MBP-TEVP-rsTEV-GFP-His6 (rsTEV: recognition site for TEV NIa protease) resulted in native and soluble EGFP protein [55]. When a fusion protein containing site F and the PPV NIa protease were driven by two compatible plasmids and expressed simultaneously within E. coli, the PPV NIa protease could process on site F correctly in vivo\n[56]. We can propose that two possible interacted-proteins and the PPV NIa protease may be fused together, separated by two cleavage sites, thereby the whole polyprotein can be expressed from one single vector. In this way, the protease component in the polyprotein is likely to perform self-cleavage in vivo, which will facilitate the analysis of the interaction between the two proteins in vivo.",
