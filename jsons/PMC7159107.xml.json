The virus genome is an 8.5 kb, positive\u2010sense single\u2010stranded RNA containing one open reading frame. The virus is antigenically highly variable and There are seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia1, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3) that do not cross\u2010protect against each other.1, 2 Foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes an economically important and highly contagious disease of cloven\u2010hoofed animals such as cattle, swine, and sheep,3 which makes this virus is monitored by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Currently, FMD vaccine is the traditional way to protect against the disease, which greatly reduces its occurrence. However, the use of FMD vaccines to protect early infection is limited, because the vaccines take protection effect until after 7 days.4 Additionally, North America and Western Europe are considered as virus\u2010free regions where the animals are not vaccinated. Therefore, the alternative strategy of applying antiviral agents is required to control the spread of FMDV in outbreak situations.",

Firstly, the LiCl can inhibit FMDV replication when FMDV infected BHK\u201021 cells. Secondly, different viral cycle treat with LiCl to further investigate which viral cycle of FMDV infection was sensitive to LiCl. We have found that the LiCl had no effects on FMDV attachment and entry in cells, which indicated that the LiCl did not directly affect the connection between the virus and cell receptor or the passageway of viruses into cells. Nevertheless, LiCl had significantly inhibited FMDV replication stage in cells with dose\u2010dependent. Thirdly, to further investigate what time course of FMDV replication stage was affected by LiCl treatment, cells were exposed to LiCl at several points in the viral replication stage. We have found that LiCl reduced FMDV replication when treated within 12 hpi, suggesting that the early time of viral replication is the target for the antiviral effect of LiCl. The early time of viral replication stage is the time that viral RNA and viral protein were synthesized, which indicated that the LiCl has inhibited the viral RNA and viral protein synthesized.",

The use of FMDV vaccines to protect early infection is limited, and the FMDV mutates frequently to escape the immune system.3, 4, 23 The resulst reveals tha LiCl has potential as an effective anti\u2010FMDV drug.
