The DNA fragment encoding N-terminal amino acid residues 1\u2013690 of S glycoprotein, flanked by the \u2018Kozak\u2019 consensus sequence, was amplified from the two DNA fragments with the approach of splice overlap extension-polymerase chain reaction (SOE-PCR), and inserted into the multi-cloning site of a eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech) between its SalI and PstI sites. The resulting plasmid was named pEGFP-S, in which enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene was located downstream of S gene. Identity of S gene to the published sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY278554) was confirmed by sequencing (Bioasia, Shanghai). Some of the nucleotides encoding the amino acid residues 1\u2013110 of S glycoprotein in the plasmid pEGFP-S were optimized utilizing mammalian preferred codons, creating the plasmid pEGFP-optS.",

Scramble siRNA [17] and EGFP siRNA [18] were used as negative and positive controls for silencing, respectively. All sequences of the siRNAs were BLAST searched in the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u2019s (NCBI) \u201csearch for short nearly exact matches\u201d mode against all human sequences deposited in the GenBank and RefSeq databases, and were not found to have significant homology to genes other than the targets. The template deoxynucleotides (Table 1\n) used for siRNA transcription were synthesized by Bioasia, Shanghai. The oligonucleotide directed production of siRNAs with T7 RNA polymerase has been described previously [18]. For each transcription reaction, 300 \u03bcM of each oligonucleotide template and T7 promoter primer were mixed and denaturalized by heating at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min. The mixture was then added with 10\u00d7 Klenow reaction buffer, dNTP mix (Promega, USA), Exo-Klenow (TaKaRa, Dalian), and nuclease-free water, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The in vitro transcription was performed in 20 \u03bcl transcription mix: 6 \u03bcl hybridization solution, 4 \u03bcl of 5\u00d7 T7 reaction buffer, 6 \u03bcl rNTP mix, 2 \u03bcl T7 RNA polymerase, and 2 \u03bcl nuclease-free water. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, sense and antisense RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both crude transcription reactions and incubating at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The concentration of the generated dsRNA was measured by the absorbance at 260 nm in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Germany). S1 nuclease and RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 1 U/\u03bcg siRNA, respectively, for the digestion of ssRNA and dsDNA. SiRNAs were assessed by RNA gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose.",

Total RNA from the transfected or non-transfected cells was extracted at 48 h posttransfection using RNAex Reagent (Watson, Shanghai) and digested with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian). One microgram of the RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA with oligo(dT)15 and the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase XL (TaKaRa, Dalian) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Reactions with no reverse transcriptase added were performed in parallel with most experiments and yielded no PCR products. 1 \u03bcM of forward primer (5\u2032-CCCATGGGTACACAGACACA-3\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032-AATAGGCTGCAGCTGACGTG-3\u2032) for SARS-CoV spike gene was used for semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with 20 cycles of denaturation (94 \u00b0C, 55 s), annealing (56 \u00b0C, 55 s), and extension (72 \u00b0C, 1 min). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control, the primers (forward primer, 5\u2032-TGGGCTACACTGAGCACCAG-3\u2032; reverse primer, 5\u2032-AAGTGGTCGTTGAGGGCAAT-3\u2032) were synthesized based on the human GAPDH mRNA sequence (GenBank Accession No. BC013310). Its reaction conditions were 25 cycles of denaturation (94 \u00b0C, 50 s), annealing (60 \u00b0C, 30 s), and extension (72 \u00b0C, 30 s). Then real-time quantitative PCR (Lightcycler, Roche) was performed as described [19] using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Dalian) with the following exceptions. Briefly, reactions were carried out in 20 \u03bcl volumes containing 2 \u03bcl reverse transcription product. To quantitate SARS-CoV spike gene transcript levels, dilutions of cDNA from the HEK 293T cells transfected with pEGFP-optS were always run in parallel with cDNA from the transfected HEK 293T cells for use as standard curve (dilutions ranged from 106\u2013100 copies of each plasmid). To perform analysis of relative expression of SARS-CoV spike gene using real-time PCR, we adopted the relative quantitative method [20], by normalizing to GAPDH expression levels. Then the percentages of SARS-CoV spike mRNA in siRNAs co-transfected cells relative to that in mock-transfected cells were calculated. The primers for GAPDH were the same as described above. The primers used for the amplification of SARS-CoV spike gene were 5\u2032-TCTGATGCCTTTTCGCTTGA-3\u2032 (forward primer) and 5\u2032-GTGCCCCAAATGTCTTGAGC-3\u2032 (reverse primer).",

At 48 h after the transfection, very mild fluorescence was detected in the pEGFP-S transfected HEK 293T cells, while strong fluorescence was observed in the pEGFP-optS transfected cells (Fig. 1\nA), which was repeated at least three times but similar results were obtained. To determine the levels of S-EGFP fusion protein expressed in transfected cells, we used convalescent SARS patient sera to detect the fusion protein but obtained very faint bands (data not shown). Therefore, we alternatively employed anti-GFP monoclonal antibody to detect it. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates showed that the S-EGFP fusion protein was expressed at high level in pEGFP-optS transfected cells but at low level in pEGFP-S transfected cells (Fig. 1B). However, the molecular weight of expressed S-EGFP is larger than the predicted one (about 82 kDa) based on amino acid composition. This may represent glycosylated protein which resulted from posttranslational modification by the eukaryotic expression system. The only difference between the two plasmids was that the plasmid pEGFP-optS contained codon-optimized spike gene utilizing mammalian preferred codons. The data indicated that replacement of codons in the spike gene with those frequently used in mammalian increased S-EGFP fusion protein expression in cultured cells, supporting the hypothesis that the observed differences in efficiency of expression of modified and unmodified spike genes were related to codon usage and GC content, as shown in other studies [21], [22]. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is possible that partial optimized codon contained in the spike gene could much more efficiently initiate gene transcription and improve efficiency of gene translation.",

Recently, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [35] and its binding site on the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was localized between amino acid residues 303 and 537 [36]. Therefore, to block the combination of S glycoprotein with receptor efficiently is crucial to prevent the virus infection. As a cellular defense mechanism, RNAi has been employed in anti-virus infections in viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C/B virus [37] and inhibition of viral replication in host cells [38]. Zhang et al. [16] introduced vector-mediated RNAi technology into the study of SARS-CoV infection, and found that the siRNAs generated from the DNA vector blocked the expression of SARS-CoV S gene and inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV in the infected cells. Their work enlightened us to explore the possibility of silencing SARS-CoV S glycoprotein expression by siRNA transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and blocking its combination with cell surface receptor.",
