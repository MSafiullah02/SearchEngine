One-lung ventilation (OLV) necessitates AGMPs, including intubation, bronchoscopy, deflating operative lung, and airway suctioning, 1 which place the anesthesiologist at high exposure risk.",

The introduction of gas flow (ie, coughing with intubation) can transform a vulnerable procedure into an AGMP with the production of droplets and aerosols. Ensuring complete neuromuscular blockade and absence of gas flow (silent airway), minimizing periods that the patient's respiratory system is open to atmosphere (open airway), and isolating patient ventilation from the surrounding atmosphere (closed circuit) are important in reducing the risk of aerosolization during procedures.",

There is little published guidance for mitigating the risk of disease transmission among HCWs performing procedures requiring lung isolation and OLV. We have developed suggestions for placement of double-lumen tubes (DLTs) for OLV based on best evidence and local expert consensus. The principle of maintaining a \"silent airway\" was used as a guide for these strategies. Traditional management of OLV with a DLT includes clamping the appropriate lumen and opening the corresponding bronchoscope port to facilitate lung deflation. This maneuver creates a vulnerable AGMP. To minimize risk, we suggest 2 options (Figure) . Bussi\u00e8res et al 4 have published stepwise approaches to expedite lung deflation with bronchial blockers; they also suggested the possibility that maintaining a closed port to the operative side ( Figure, panel A) of the DLT, while clamping the appropriate lumen for OLV, could increase resorption atelectasis by eliminating dilution of intra-alveolar O 2 with ambient air. 5 The benefit of this method is maintenance of a closed system. Alternatively, to open the operative DLT lumen to atmosphere with the clamp applied, a second filter should be added to the now \"open\" airway ( Figure,  panel B) . Application of suction to the operative lung to expedite lung collapse can be considered with acknowledgement of inherent risks. To prevent environmental contamination with a soiled FOB, we have adjusted practice to keep it immediately available, but in a container separate from the FOB tower.",
