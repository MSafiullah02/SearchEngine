            "text": "History has demonstrated that pathogens may cause devastating consequences in our health and economy. Thus, the rapid spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, causing the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a clear current example. In this regard, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 starting in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 (WHO, 2020c). According to the WHO, the current COVID-19 outbreak situation has confirmed 1,812,734 cases and 113,675 deaths involving 213 countries (WHO, 2020a) where Spain is one of the leading countries of this global health crisis with 172,541 confirmed cases and 18,056 confirmed deaths (ISCIII, 2020) (data reported on April 14th 2020) in a population of about 47 million people. Nonetheless, experts are warning that there could be many more cases that have not been detected and/or informed, especially in undeveloped countries. This strain continues to spread globally, overwhelming intensive care units and health system capacity. The present outbreak of this coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades and has been identified as a zoonotic coronavirus, similar to SARS coronavirus and MERS (Liu et al., 2020). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related (88\u201389% similarity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (Lai et al., 2020). However, it is more distant from SARS-CoV (~79% similarity) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (~50% similarity) (Jiang et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is stable from several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces, according to a new study from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UCLA and Princeton University scientists (van Doremalen et al., 2020). These scientists have found that SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in aerosols for up to 3 h, up to 4 h on copper, up to 24 h on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. These results provide key information about the stability of this strain and suggest that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects. Thus, this pathogen is easily spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and this type of infection has shown a basic reproduction number of about 2.24\u20133.58 (Lai et al., 2020; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020). It is often spread via coughing, sneezing, touching or even breathing, and those who do not exhibit symptoms can also spread the illness (American Lung Association, 2020). In fact, this coronavirus has been reported to spread faster than its two ancestors SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Vellingiri et al., 2020), probably due to the high transmission rate produced by asymptomatic carriers (Bai et al., 2020; Singhal, 2020). Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing and covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing. It has also been recommended to avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing and keep a distance of 1\u20132 m from them (WHO, 2020b).",

            "text": "The lockdown for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and Spain after one month follow up has shown positive results in flattening the epidemic curve (Tob\u00edas, 2020). However, even though these unprecedented containment and mitigation policies implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19 in most countries, including travel restrictions, screening and testing of travellers, isolation and quarantine, and school and university closures, the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continues to spread. Indeed, a recent study has demonstrated that under certain combinations of an individual patient's physiology and environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, the gas cloud and its payload of pathogen-bearing droplets of all sizes can travel 7\u20138 m (Bourouiba, 2020). Viruses can be transmitted by being influenced by several factors, including climatic conditions (temperature and humidity), and population density (Dalziel et al., 2018). In this regard, previous studies have suggested a correlation between weather and COVID-19 pandemic in a similar way that it occurs with other viral infectious diseases such as influenza (Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Oliveiros et al., 2020; Tosepu et al., 2020). However, other studies have reported contradictory results showing that meteorological conditions may not be associated with COVID-19 in terms of absolute humidity (Shi et al., 2020) or temperature (Jamil et al., 2020; Xie and Zhu, 2020). According to these last authors, the previous results showing evidence for a correlation between meteorological factors with COVID-19 transmission was likely to be an artifact, reflecting the pathways of spread. In fact, several of these previous studies have been performed considering only meteorological factors, without accounting for non-meteorological variables that might be more decisive.",

In the present paper, we focus on the case of Spain. Spain is located in a temperate zone of the world. However, it is the most climatically diverse country in Europe and it is classified within the 10 most climatically diverse countries in the world (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino. AEMET, 2011). Spain is currently a country with the third-highest life expectancy of the world (WHO, 2020b), which explains somehow the high impact which is causing COVID-19 in this country, especially in old people for whom this disease represents a major threat (Morley and Vellas, 2020). In addition, according to the World Tourism Organization, Spain was the country in the world with the second highest international tourist arrivals in 2019 (UNWTO, 2019). The climate in Spain varies across the entire country with five main climatic zones: the hot-summer Mediterranean climate, which is dominant on the Iberian Peninsula; the warm-summer Mediterranean climate in parts of north-western Spain and mostly inland the central-northern Spain; the oceanic climate in the northern part of Spain; the semiarid climate in the south-eastern part of the country; the warm-summer continental climate in many areas of the north-eastern zones located over 1000 m above sea level (Kottek et al., 2006).",

However, some of these covariates are highly correlated to each other, for which reason it is convenient to use them separately, or to make a selection of them, to avoid multicollinearity issues. Population density, the number of visitors and the number of companies all show a Pearson's correlation above 0.85 at the province level (Table 2\n). Fitting three independent models with each of these covariates alone yielded very similar results. Therefore, population density was chosen for being the most common and accessible variable of the three.

The rest of the random effects indicated in Eq. (2) were considered for the three models.

This conclusion is in good agreement with a previous study on the association between mean temperature and COVID-19 spread performed in 122 cities of China (Xie and Zhu, 2020). Although the authors of this study found that mean temperature was positively associated with newly confirmed cases when temperature was below 3\u00b0, this association was not observed for temperatures above 3\u00b0, which is close to the range of mean temperature measured in Spain for the period that we have investigated: 95% of the daily mean temperature values observed ranged from 5\u00b0 to 18\u00b0. In this regard, it is important to note that the period under study is months ahead from the summer season, where temperatures will be considerably higher. Future studies may lead to different findings, but no extrapolation to warmer periods should be done from current investigations.",

            "text": "In conclusion, further research would be needed to better elucidate the role of several meteorological variables on the expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic, for several reasons. Currently available data on the epidemic is subject to a large degree of uncertainty. The number of confirmed cases is globally underestimated, and comparisons across countries, cities or regions are difficult to be determined due to differences in data collection procedures or health policies, among others. Under these circumstances, every statistical analysis of COVID-19 data needs to be interpreted with caution (Royal Statistical Society, 2020). It is also important to remark that measuring the effect of weather-related covariates on the virus transmission is highly complex. Indeed, weather usually affects several aspects of human daily life such as commuting choices or leisure activities, among many others. Therefore, the interaction between weather conditions and human behaviour can be a confounder of the true relationship between environmental conditions and virus propagation.",
