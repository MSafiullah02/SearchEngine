            "text": "\nNucleic acid amplification for detection of DNA or RNA is an indispensable technique in many fields of life science, with applications ranging from molecular diagnosis of bacterial or viral species in blood or food to clinical studies on tumors or other diseases in the context of personalized medicine. The development of real-time monitoring of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represented a major breakthrough in quantitative detection of nucleic acids. Most current real-time PCR systems employ fluorescence-based detection using intercalating reagents (e.g., SYBR Green) or sequence-specific reporter probes to quantitate amplified PCR products. The resulting curve of fluorescence intensity enables measurement of nucleic acid concentration over a wide range (8 orders of magnitude) with high sensitivity (<5 copies) and high precision (<2% standard deviation). Over the last few decades, several infectious diseases have emerged, including AIDS, SARS, influenza, and Ebola; these illnesses threaten the lives and health of people around the world. Consequently, global efforts are being made to control and monitor these emerging infectious diseases. In one approach within this broad strategy, miniaturized nucleic acid amplification systems have been intensively studied as alternatives for point-of-care testing. However, optical detection schemes limit the miniaturization of the total PCR system , and the addition of exogenous fluorescent reagents sometimes inhibits the DNA polymerase. Because they require minimal instrumentation and low electrical power, however, electrical/electrochemical detection methods provide promising alternative detection schemes that could overcome these issues in the context of point-of-care testing devices [1, 2]. Furthermore, non-optical sensing devices can be easily fabricated using fine processing technology, and highly integrated sensor arrays can be realized using the advanced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process.",

            "text": "P. Bergveld created the first ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET)-based biosensor in 1970 [3]. ISFET (ion-sensitive field-effect transistor) biosensors are composed of sensor surfaces functionalized by immobilization of probe biomolecules used as transducers/detectors. Various types of bioanalytes can be coupled with ISFETs such as genetic ISFETs, cell-ISFETs, or immuno-ISFETs. ISFETs take advantage of the fact that field effect transistors (FETs ) change their source-drain \u201cchannel\u201d conductivity depending on the electric field of their environment. Essentially, the output signal is a gate voltage or drain current that changes charge density on the gate surface before/after the molecular recognition event. One of the most successful examples of commercialized products exploiting these technologies is the Ion Torrent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) semiconductor chip-based DNA sequencer, launched in 2012 [4\u20136]. As shown in Fig. 1, millions of ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs), which detect released protons during PCR, are integrated in a chip with a well structure. Template DNA strands are immobilized on the surface of microbeads, which are captured into the well structures. After single-base synthesis by DNA polymerase, the resulting pH change is detected by pH-sensitive ISFET to confirm the extension reaction. ISFETs have also been used as detectors for real-time PCR, replacing fluorescence detection. However, the electrical properties of ISFETs change significantly during PCR thermal cycles. To overcome this problem, current work has focused on combining of isothermal nucleic acid amplification (rather than PCR) with electrical/electrochemical devices [7, 8]. There are several electrochemical nucleic acid detection methods employing amperometry, voltammetry, and AC-impedance. Solid-phase and solution-phase nucleic acid amplifications combined with electrochemical methods are summarized in the Ref. [9]. Intercalator- or redox marker-mediated electron transfer on the sensor surface is employed as a manner of electrochemical signal readout. For isothermal nucleic acid amplification combined with electrochemical measurement, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and rolling circle amplification (RCA) are often used. Because these amplification processes are conducted by a strand-displacing DNA polymerase at a constant temperature, their performance is comparable to that of PCR. Thus, simpler, miniaturized high-throughput measurements for point-of-care testing devices could be realized by combining electro/electrochemical devices and isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods.\n",

RCA reaction time was optimized at 2 h because the reaction rate did not change after 4 h (Fig. 5a).\nSensitivity of the RCA-CC assay was examined using stepwise diluted target miR-143 (concentration range, 10 fM\u201310 nM), and the RCA reaction was performed at 30 \u00b0C for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 5b, the detection limit was 100 fM, and was improved by RCA (detection limit of hybridization was 10 nM).Figure 5c shows the detection of miR-143 spiked in human blood samples (see\nNotes\n1 and 2); the RCA reaction was performed at 30 \u00b0C for 2 h. The detection threshold of miR-143 in blood samples was 1 pM, with a dynamic range from 1 pM to 1 nM.Selectivity of the RCA-CC assay was also confirmed at 100 pM miR-143 and equal amounts of other microRNAs, including miR-1, miR-122, and miR-145. The concentration of DNA probe 2 added was 10 nM, and the RCA reaction was performed at 30 \u00b0C for 2 h. The delta charge value of miR-143 obtained by the RCA-CC assay was significantly higher than those of miR-1, miR-122, and miR-145 (Fig. 5d).\n\n",

The end of a silicon tube (3.0 cm) was dipped in the membrane solution, removed, and allowed to dry.The tube covered with the resultant membrane was filled with internal solution consisting of 10 mM KCl and 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Ag/AgCl ink was applied to half of length of a Ag wire (7.0 cm). The Ag/AgCl wire was inserted, and the top of the tube was sealed with Parafilm. Finally, the Et+ISE was conditioned by soaking overnight in conditioning solution. The fabricated Et+ISE system is shown in Fig. 6.\nThe electrical properties of Et+ISE exhibit Nernstian behavior. According to the Nernst equation (Eq. ((3)), the linear dependence of electrode potential on log [Et+] can be obtained.3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ E={E}_0+\\left(2.303\\raisebox{1ex}{$\\mathrm{R} T$}\\!\\left/ \\!\\raisebox{-1ex}{$ z\\mathrm{F}$}\\right.\\right) \\log a $$\n\\end{document}E=E0+2.303RTzFlogawhere E\n0 is the standard electrode potential, R the ideal gas constant, T the temperature in Kelvin, z the number of moles of electrons, F the Faraday constant, and a the ion activity.\nPG-RCA.The circular probe was prepared as described by Murakami et al. [13]. Briefly, 20 \u03bcL of mixture containing 1.0 \u03bcM circular probe, reaction buffer, 2.5 mM MnCl2, and 5.0 U/\u03bcL CircLigase II ssDNA Ligase were incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 2 h. The mixture was incubated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 min to inactivate CircLigase II ssDNA Ligase. Subsequently, the unligated linear sequence was digested by addition of Exonuclease I (10 U/\u03bcL) and incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, followed by incubation at 80 \u00b0C for 5 min to inactivate the exonuclease I. The ligated circular probe was purified using the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit. On average, the concentration of circular probes was 300\u2013800 nM in 40 \u03bcL.A schematic illustration of PG-RCA is shown in Fig. 7. PG-RCA reaction solution (30 \u03bcL) contained NE buffer, 500 \u03bcM dNTP mix, 50 nM ligated circular probe, 0.04 U/\u03bcL phi29 DNA polymerase, 0.4 U/\u03bcL Nb.BbvCI nicking endonuclease, 50 \u03bcM EtBr, and various concentrations of target DNA. Potential change was monitored at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, and the reaction was terminated by incubation at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min.\n\nElectrical properties of Et+ISE.To evaluate the different membrane composition of Et+ISE, potential changes at various EtBr concentrations (10\u22127\u201310\u22123 M) were measured. The ratio of Siloprene K1000 and Siloprene cross-linking agent K-11 was fixed at 5, 7, or 9:1 with constant weight of 4% KTpClPB in 30 \u03bcL of 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing EtBr.At ratios of 5:1 and 7:1, the potential traces were not sufficiently reproducible (Fig. 8a). On the other hand, at a ratio of 9:1, the traces were close to the Nernstian slopes (61.5 mV/activity decade at 37 \u00b0C). The response time (t 95%) was within 5 s, and the potential almost completely stabilized within 30 s.\n\nOptimization of EtBr concentration for PG-RCA monitoring.At high concentrations, DNA intercalators such as EtBr can inhibit DNA amplification. To examine the influence of the inhibitory effect of EtBr on DNA amplification efficiency, PG-RCA (target DNA: 1 \u03bcM, 100 nM, 10 nM) was performed at various concentrations of EtBr (10\u22125\u201310\u22124 M) (Fig. 8b).In order to measure a high potential response, the initial EtBr concentration must be high. After considering the DNA amplification efficiency, 50 \u03bcM EtBr was chosen for potentiometric measurements.\nReal-time PG-RCA detection using micro Et+ISE.The Et+ISE system for potentiometric measurement on PG-RCA is shown in Fig. 9a. From Eq. ((3), the potential that develops in this Et+ISE is proportional to the log of the Et+ ion activity in the PG-RCA solution. The real-time potential shift during PG-RCA was measured by an electrometer as difference between reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) and Et+ISE.\nAs PG-RCA progresses under isothermal conditions at 37 \u00b0C, EtBr is bound to the newly formed DNA, reducing the free EtBr concentration in the sample solution. In this potentiometric measurement, the Et+ISE potential signal decreases during PG-RCA.As shown in Fig. 9b, the potential signal decreased over time, and the decrease in the rate and range depended on the initial target DNA concentration. Furthermore, a constant potential was observed in the target DNA-free control sample. When the PG-RCA condition was 1 \u03bcM initial target DNA and the initial concentration ratio of target DNA to EtBr was 1:50, the Et+ISE potential signal rapidly over the first 40 min. The decrease in potential value was 60 mV. This result corresponds to a 90% reduction in the free EtBr concentration in the PG-RCA bulk solution.To confirm the role of PG-RCA monitoring using EtBr, a similar experiment was performed using SYBR Green I. Because of the strong affinity of SYBR Green for DNA, the PG-RCA reaction was inhibited in the presence of 50 \u03bcM SYBR Green instead of EtBr (data not shown). Furthermore, because DNA amplification can be performed at EtBr concentrations above the detection limit of ISEs, EtBr is suitable as an electrochemical signal reporter.\n\n",
