The pharmacological inhibition of autophagy contributes to increase the efficacy of antineoplastic agents. Exposing tumor cells to low concentrations of select autophagy-inducing antineoplastic agents increases their immunogenicity and enhances their ability to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) maturation. We tested whether the application of an autophagy-inhibiting agent, chloroquine (CQ), in combination with low concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) increases the ability of tumor cells to induce DC maturation. DCs sensitized with the lysate of HCT-116 cells previously exposed to such a combination enhanced the DC maturation/activation ability. These matured DCs also increased the allogeneic responsiveness of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which showed a greater proliferative response than those from DCs sensitized with control lysates. The T cells expanded in such cocultures were CD69+ and PD-1-and produced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 and lower levels of IL-10, consistent with the preferential activation of Th1 cells. Cocultures of autologous DCs and lymphocytes improved the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as assessed by the expression of CD107a, perforin, and granzyme B. The drug combination increased the expression of genes related to the CEACAM family (BECN1, ATGs, MAPLC3B, ULK1, SQSTM1) and tumor suppressors (PCBP1). Furthermore, the decreased expression of genes related to metastasis and tumor progression (BNIP3, BNIP3L, FOSL2, HES1, LAMB3, LOXL2, NDRG1, P4HA1, PIK3R2) was noted.

Quinolones function as weak bases that passively diffuse into the lysosomes where they are protonated and prevented from leaving this vesicle. Their presence increases the lysosome pH, interrupting its functions and preventing the end of autophagy [20, 21] . As anti-inflammatory drugs, quinolones have been used to treat some autoimmune diseases [22] .

This phenomenon was confirmed by the observation that CQ + 5-FU treatment strongly reduced cell proliferation and induced early apoptosis in tumor cells, although CQ or 5-FU alone had no apparent effect on cell viability. 5-Fluorouracil induces apoptosis in cancer cells [41] , and the inhibition of autophagy by CQ can potentiate the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. This occurs because the accumulation of vesicles in the cytoplasm due to incomplete autophagy can cause oxidative stress and lead to cell death. Based on this information, we aimed to confirm whether the toxicity of low 5-FU concentrations would be enhanced by CQ.

In addition to being a maturation marker, CD83 modulates the immune response by stimulating both naive and memory T cells [43] . CD83 expression was also enhanced by the drug combination. Although apoptotic cell death is considered non-immunogenic or weakly immunogenic, it is possible that apoptosis induced by the blockage of autophagy results in the expression of danger signals (e.g., DAMPs) that are usually not expressed during physiological apoptosis.

In the present study, we observed a small increase in the expression of HSP-70 but irrelevant changes in the HSP-90 and HMGB genes.

Exposing tumor cells to other drugs such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin increases the expression of the antigen processing machinery via the cytosolic route, such as TAP1, tapasin, and calnexin [11] . This view is reinforced by the observation that chemical stress triggers the cell surface expression of calreticulin (CALR) [12] , another molecule promoting the antigenic processing of tumor cells. Interestingly, CALR moves from the endoplasmic reticulum (where it functions as an APM component) to the cytoplasmic membrane, where it serves as a potent activating signal.

Specifically, DCs sensitized with the lysates of HCT-116 Fig. 5 . In vitro generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is improved by DCs exposed to lysates of HCT-116 previously treated with 5-FU + CQ. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of proliferating CD8+ cells (A) of four healthy donors at individual effector:target ratios (3.25:1, 7.5:1, and 15:1).

The more intense proliferative effect on CD4+ T lymphocytes is also in agreement with their ability to interact with the HLA-DR molecules expressed by DCs. Furthermore, the increased proliferation of CD8+ T lymphocytes suggests the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that are specific for tumor cells (since their proliferation was stimulated by DCs sensitized with HCT-116 lysates). Aiming to confirm that the combination of 5-FU and CQ can stimulate the proliferation of CD8+ lymphocytes, we performed a CTL assay, which, unlike the MLR, tests the ability of DCs to stimulate the proliferation of autologous CD8+ lymphocytes that target tumor cells [46] . Our main difficulty when evaluating the direct cytotoxicity of CTLs against target cells is that HCT-116 cells are adherent, but most available assays for this purpose work well for cells in suspension and are not reliable for adherent cell types. There are some chemiluminescence-based assays for this, but we were unable to acquire the appropriate kit. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the expression of perforin and granzyme B by CTLs challenged with tumor target cells, following the methodology proposed by Betts et al [47] . These proteins are considered to be functional markers in cells with cytotoxic capacity [48] ; perforin polymerization perforates the target cell membrane, while granzyme B induces apoptosis [49] .

The findings also indicated that there was no selective activation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, since the percentage of CD69+ cells was increased in both subpopulations. Accordingly, these same treatments resulted in a reduced generation of PD-1+ cells among CD4+ T lymphocytes. PD-1 is a member of the CD28 family, and its primary function is to limit clustering of the TCR and costimulatory molecules within the immunologic synapse. PD-1 expression is increased in the T cells of patients with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and various leukemias and lymphomas [51] . Therefore, PD-1 expression in T cells and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells constitute a tumor escape mechanism. We observed reduced PD-1 expression on the expanding lymphocytes cocultured with DCs. This aspect is particularly interesting because the signals associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 are among the main checkpoint blockades of the antitumor response.
