In this study we investigated the possible involvement in MS of two herpes viruses: the neurotropic human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) and the related human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Utilising fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) techniques, we examined human post mortem tissues for the presence of immediate early and late viral gene or protein expression in MS patient normal appearing white matter (NAWM), lesional tissue and normal control brain samples. HHV-7 and/or HHV-8 mRNA or protein was detected in some individuals in all three sample categories and was restricted to oligodendrocytes, as determined by double mRNA FISH analysis or immuno fluorescence (IF). No samples showed evidence of viral mRNA when subjected to RT-PCR on extracted ribonucleic acid. We therefore conclude that there is little evidence in our particular sample cohort to suggest involvement of either HHV-7 or HHV-8 in MS. D",

Autoimmune and genetic factors are unlikely to wholly explain the aetiology of this disease, and an environmental component has long been postulated to be involved in MS pathogenesis [1] [2] [3] . Pathogens such as bacteria and viruses are the predominant candidates for the environmental factor in MS. Of these two biological candidate groups, viruses have been and remain the leading contenders and MS relapsing episodes are frequently preceded by common viral infections [4] . The infection theory of MS is strengthened by the observation that the CSF of MS patients contain temporally stable oligoclonal IgGs that could be the result of an antigen-driven chronic activation of possibly poly-specific B-cells [4] [5] [6] [7] . It is possible that this reaction is triggered by a combination of viruses, the order in which these infections takes place influencing the subsequent immunological reaction [8] With an ever increasing list of viral candidates, including the more recent additions of endogenous retroviruses, coronaviruses and several recently discovered herpesviruses [9] [10] [11] [12] there are many Fcontenders_ to chose from and little evidence to favour one above the other.",

Among these properties are the ability to initiate and maintain a latent infection in ganglionic neuronal cells with subsequent reactivation (prime examples being cold sores and shingles, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), respectively) and neurotropism [13, 14] . Herpesviruses which can cause demyelinating pathology and infection by other viruses are capable of triggering reactivation of latent herpesviruses [15] . Earlier investigations by others and ourselves have provided evidence to implicate a possible role of HHV-6 in MS pathogenesis [9,16 -22] . We have recently shown that Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) activity is increased in MS lesion tissue compared to both normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal control tissue [22] . As a logical development of this work we decided to investigate whether the closely related human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) were also detectable in MS brains.",

            "text": "Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) is a member of the hherpesvirus family, closely related to HHV-6. HHV-7 was isolated in 1990 [23] and comprises a 145 kb genome encoding over 70 proteins, many of which share close homologies with HHV-6, Eppstein Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) proteins. Infection generally occurs early in childhood, with most individuals seropositive for HHV-7 antibodies by the age of 3 [24, 25] , with 80% of adults testing positive for HHV-7 DNA in PBMCs [26] . Some report that HHV-7 may not undergo a latent stage, but remains persistent at low levels throughout the lifespan of an individual [27, 28] , others that the virus produces no mRNA in the latent state [29] . Primary infection has been associated with some cases of exanthem subitum [30, 31] and encephalopathy [32, 33] , although more have been attributed to HHV-6 infection. Another condition associated with both HHV-7 and HHV-6 is pityriasis rosea, an inflammatory skin condition which occurs in adults in their 20's and 30's, which is attributed to reactivation of the two herpesviruses [34] . Although HHV-7 reactivation has been seen frequently in patients with demyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system [35] , HHV-7 has also been found in the CNS at varying levels. A review by Dewhurst [36] concludes that HHV-7 is found in 5% of brain tissue samples. This result is consistent with that of Chan et al. [37] , but whilst only 5% of the brain samples were positive, multiple samples were taken from patients so that total patient positivity was 37%. It has also been shown that HHV-7 can reactivate HHV-6 from latency in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [38] , which may explain the cooccurrence of these two viruses in pityriasis rosea.",

In all cases the positive HHV-7 protein signal co-located with that for the oligodendrocyte specific protein MOBP (see Fig. 1A ). The protocol for antigen unmasking for the latent HHV-8 antibody proved to be detrimental to tissue morphology and could not be used. The antibody against HHV-8 virion envelope glycoprotein ORF K8.1A/B was successful. The two sample sets exhibiting a strong positive signal for HHV-7 protein were also positive for HHV-8 envelope protein, again locating to oligodendrocytes (see Fig. 1B ). The control Kaposi's sarcoma tissue was also found to exhibit cytoplasmic positive staining for the envelope protein (see Fig. 1D ). No signal was seen in the 3 normal control brains.

Viral activity appears to be confined to oligodendrocytes and is seen in only a proportion of the samples examined. Within positive tissue, the infected cells appear to be randomly distributed in clusters with no more than one in 20 views exhibiting positively labelled cells (or an estimated upper level of oligodendrocytes infected with either virus of 5%). As the mRNA FISH signal needed 12 rounds of amplification, we conclude that levels of viral expression in infected cells must be low.",

Future studies will also need to examine acute MS lesional tissues to answer this point.

Notwithstanding this limitation the data obtained were internally consistent with clear negative results.",

The latter authors also found an uneven distribution of viral nucleic acid within the positive tissues, which is mirrored by, and consistent with, our protein and mRNA results. This uneven distribution of positive cells within the tissue may help account for the poor PCR and RT-PCR results, and suggests that multiple sampling must take place for a confident PCR result.",

As with HHV-7 results, we could only see a very small number of positively staining cells per section (in most cases a total of 2 views containing no more than a dozen positive cells in all out of almost one hundred views in total). Our results compare favourably to those reported by Chan et al. [39] on HHV-8 DNA prevalence in post mortem brain tissue. In their study, 10 samples from each of 30 individuals were examined and a total of 14% of these samples gave positive results for HHV-8 DNA. When this is tallied with the number of individuals that gave at least one positive sample, 63.3% of the individuals were positive for HHV-8 DNA in the brain. It is therefore probable that if we had access to multiple samples from all individuals in our study, a higher proportion would have scored positively for HHV-8 in both our PCR and in situ studies, including the normal control samples.",
