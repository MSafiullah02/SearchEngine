In this view lung-infiltrated neutrophils seem out of place during RSV infection. The promiscuous cytotoxicity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments might even potentiate virus-induced lung injury.12 Indeed, the degree of neutrophilic inflammation correlates with disease severity in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis.13 Moreover, a common single nucleotide polymorphism just upstream of the IL-8\u2013encoding gene that is tentatively associated with increased production of IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, is more frequent among infants with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis, in particular among infants who lack other known risk factors.14 Increased IL-8 levels in the airways of patients with bronchiolitis are linked to increased disease severity, as measured based on oxygen saturation, Silverman score, and respiratory rate.15, 16 Genes related to neutrophil function, such as those encoding \u03b1-defensin-1 and elastase, are overexpressed in the blood of patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis, and expression levels positively correlate with disease severity.17 Thus neutrophils are thought to contribute to lung injury in patients with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis, but their exact role in pathogenesis is still unclear.",

Nonetheless, nearly half of children with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis present with asthma at 6 years of age.5 Estimates indicate that early-life RSV-induced bronchiolitis is responsible for up to 13% of childhood asthma cases.24 Moreover, smoking adults with RSV-induced bronchiolitis during infancy, but not those without LRTIs in early life, have an increased risk of persistent asthma.26 However, association does not necessarily imply causation. Severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis could occur mainly in infants with pre-existing susceptibility to asthma development. Common genetic and/or environmental factors appear to underlie predisposition to both diseases.21\n",

Indeed, a functional IL-8 polymorphism more frequent among infants with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis is also overrepresented in infants who had postbronchiolitis wheezing compared with patients with bronchiolitis who did not have wheezing afterward.14, 36 Neutrophilic inflammation\u2013induced collateral tissue damage and airway sensitization could mediate the development of asthma susceptibility.",

            "text": "Transient damage to development of infant lungs can have far-reaching and lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary anatomy and function; this is particularly true if the critical process of alveolar multiplication by septation is disrupted.37 Elastin fibers, which are present in alveolar duct and septal walls, provide elasticity to the lungs and transmit cues of mechanical stress to stimulate alveolarization. Neutrophil elastase, which is released on neutrophil recruitment to the lungs, degrades elastin fibers and thereby demolishes lung tissue structure.38 Through elastase release and other lung-damaging mechanisms discussed below, the massive pulmonary neutrophil infiltrate of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis might thus cause irreparable disruption of lung development that predisposes these infants to subsequent asthma inception (Fig 1\n). In addition to inducing airway remodeling through collateral tissue damage, neutrophils might sensitize the airways to asthma through mast cell recruitment. IL-9 is detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis, and airway-infiltrated neutrophils are the principal producers.39 In response to pulmonary expression of IL-9, long-lived mast cells migrate to and accumulate in lung tissue.40, 41 Lung-resident mast cells, specifically those located in the bronchial smooth muscle bundles, contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness and are considered crucial to the pathogenesis of (allergic) asthma (Fig 1).42\n",

The association of a polymorphism in the gene encoding IL-17 with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis supports this notion.62 Moreover, the response of TH17 cells, noted producers of IL-17, is enhanced in infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis.63 An RSV mouse model also links IL-17 and TH17 responses to RSV disease severity: pulmonary neutrophil recruitment and lung pathology are exacerbated in RSV-infected mice, which have increased TH17 responses caused by genetic ablation of the IL-27 receptor.64 Moreover, genetic ablation or antibody-mediated blocking of IL-17 in RSV-infected mice reduces neutrophilic inflammation, mucus production, and viral loads and improves the cytotoxic T-cell response against RSV.65 Nonetheless, it is not clear whether local IL-17 levels are protective or harmful. IL-17 reduces airway reactivity of RSV-infected mice presensitized with ovalbumin,66 and mice that received a novel attenuated Bordetella pertussis vaccine were protected from RSV infection in an IL-17\u2013dependent fashion.67 It is possible that a limited IL-17 response is protective, whereas excessive IL-17 production induces immune pathology through unrestrained neutrophil recruitment. However, the early recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs of patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is unlikely to be mediated by an adaptive TH17 response because RSV antigen\u2013driven clonal expansion and differentiation of TH17 cells require several days. Instead, there might be a role for natural TH17 cells that acquire effector functions during thymic development and regulate early-phase airway neutrophil responses.68, 69 Thus (natural) TH17 cells and IL-17 might promote a pathogenic neutrophil-dominated response to RSV infection.",

            "text": "The vast number of lung-infiltrating neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis appears to be the principal instigator of pulmonary immunopathology. The secretion of proteolytic enzymes, such as elastase, the production of ROS, and NET release can clearly injure the lungs. This might disrupt the delicate process of lung development in infancy and have lasting adverse consequences for lung anatomy, function, and susceptibility to chronic disease, including asthma. However, through direct antiviral activity of these and other neutrophil mechanisms, as well as through regulation of adaptive immune responses, neutrophils can also contribute to a protective antiviral response. In patients with severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis, the balance between neutrophil antimicrobial activity and collateral tissue damage appears to have shifted toward a pathologic response. Hence pharmacologic suppression of neutrophil activity could curtail lung injury. Possible approaches include (1) neutrophil-inhibitory macrolides43, 46; (2) inhibiting damaging neutrophil-derived products, such as elastase114; (3) antagonizing neutrophil-modulatory adenosine115; (4) neutrophil chemokine receptor blockade116, 117; (5) and targeting neutrophil-expressed inhibitory receptors.118, 119 We eagerly await the results of future clinical trials for the treatment of RSV infection with pharmacologic agents that can effectively dampen neutrophilic inflammation, such as the selective small-molecule CXCR2 (IL-8 receptor) antagonist danirixin (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02201303).117\n",

The safety of treating RSV-induced bronchiolitis with neutrophil suppression could improve with the administration of RSV antivirals and prophylactic antibiotics. Recently, a newly developed RSV antiviral was successfully tested in a clinical trial wherein healthy adult subjects were challenged with RSV.126 By itself, however, an RSV antiviral might confer limited benefit when administered several days after onset of symptoms. For influenza, oseltamivir is only effective when administered within 36 to 48 hours after symptom onset.127 Similarly, antiviral treatments against RSV should ideally be administered as close to initial infection as possible to be at their most effective, yet RSV loads are already on the decrease when patients are admitted to the intensive care unit.128 Nonetheless, neutrophils are still abundantly present in the lungs,9, 10, 11 and thus neutrophil-mediated damage to the airways persists (Fig 2). Therefore we propose that suppressing neutrophil activity under the umbrella of RSV antivirals and prophylactic antibiotics offers a promising treatment strategy to improve the outcomes of infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis and reduce the risk of subsequent asthma.",
