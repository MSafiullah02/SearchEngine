It seems prudent to ensure \u201coptimal\u201d control of hyperglycemia, even though defining this is problematic in critically ill patients.37, 38 The admission SOFA score may also be helpful to identify at-risk patients, but this has been developed for \u201cWestern\u201d patients with sepsis who often have comorbidities, multiorgan failure, and shock.21 Whether the SOFA or a pneumonia scoring system in this predominantly respiratory illness is more relevant requires more research focused on affected populations.39\n",
