Despite progress in medical treatment to control cardiovascular risk factors and stabilize the atheromatous plaque, a large number of patients still require myocardial revascularization procedures, with a major shift over the last two decades from coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS) to percutaneous angioplasty intervention (PCI) as the revascularization of choice [2, 3]. Importantly, the proportion of high-risk patients undergoing CABGS has increased owing to the ageing population and the rising prevalence of associated comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and heart failure [2, 4].",

First, in isolated cardiac muscle preparations, insulin exerts concentration-dependent positive inotropic effects after coupling to specific membrane receptors and subsequent stimulation of calcium ATPase activity, sodium/calcium exchange activity as well as calcium current in L-type channel [33]. Second, sensitization and increase in beta-1 adrenergic receptors may further enhance myoplasmic calcium availability by increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate substrates [34, 35]. Third, GIK has been shown to suppress the surgically-induced inflammatory response, as reflected by reduced levels of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 that are implicated in cardiac contractile dysfunction [36]. Finally, in GIK treated hearts, the increased glucose uptake coupled with decreased free fatty acid (FFA) uptake, results in a shift from FFA to glucose aerobic metabolism and more efficient oxygen utilization, with larger amounts of ATP being generated per oxygen mole and directly available for excitation\u2013contraction coupling within the cardiomyocytes [37]. Contrasting with the immediate response to beta-adrenergic receptor agonists, the maximal positive inotropic effects has been shown to occur 20 to 40 min after GIK infusion and this delayed response lend support to a predominant metabolic effect of the GIK [38].",

Mitigation of the contractile dysfunction with GIK pretreatment may result from optimization of cardiac metabolism and promotion of cardiomyocyte survival pathways before the onset of myocardial ischemia [12, 35]. In fasted animals, the oxidation of glucose, lactate and pyruvate contributes to less than 5% of myocardial energy production and has been associated with greater vulnerability to ischemic myocardial damages due to uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and energy dissipation [39]. In contrast, GIK infusion promotes a fed-liked state by altering gene expression and enzymes activities resulting in enhanced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis with increased provision of high-energy substrates (ATP and creatinine phosphate) to sustain short period of myocardial ischemia. Indeed, experimental studies have reported an association between high pre-ischemic glycogen content and improved functional recovery from ischemia [36, 40].",

First, although both groups presented similar comorbidities and operative risk score, baseline GIK-treated patients presented lower LVEF than in the Placebo group, making them more sensitive to subsequent functional improvement. Second, TEE assessment was exclusively focused on the LV, using load-dependent indices of LV systolic function and mitral flow propagation velocity, a load-independent surrogate of LV relaxation. These investigation tools could also be applied to the RV which may benefit (or not) from GIK infusion. Third, this substudy was not designed nor powered to evaluate meaningful clinical outcomes. Hence, the observed improvement in LV function and reduced need for inotropes did not translate into reduced postoperative cardiac mortality and morbidity, except a reduced occurrence of pulmonary complications that was explained by easier weaning from the ventilator consequent to improved LV function. Interestingly, Duncan et al. recently reported that intraoperative maintenance of normoglycemia with a fixed high-dose insulin and variable glucose adjustment was associated with reduced 30-day mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery [42].",
