Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus represented a novel member of the betacoronavirus and was most closely related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 [2], which were distinct from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3]. Since then, MERS-CoV continued to circulate and cause human infection in different countries [4], including 27 countries in Europe, North Africa, Asia, USA, and the Middle East. From September 2012 to September 2016, WHO documented 1806 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV globally, including at least 643 related deaths with a case fatality rate of 35.6% (http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-September-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/). A number of clusters, including a recent outbreak in the Republic of Korea, indicated human-to-human transmission of the virus, evoking global concern and intensive discussion worldwide [4]. Although many therapeutic antibodies, including humanized neutralizing antibody, have been developed [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], none has been approved for clinical application. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV infection is urgent.",

            "text": "Spike (S) protein mediates coronavirus entry into host-cells by first binding to the receptor on the host-cell surface [10]. As a class I viral membrane fusion protein, the ectodomain of S can be divided into receptor-binding S1 and membrane-fusion S2 subunits. S1 contains two independent domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) [11], either or both of which could function as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of various coronaviruses [12]. The NTD of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) recognizes carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) [13], and the CTD of SARS-CoV recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [14]. The NTD and CTD of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) recognize the sugar and aminopeptidase N (APN) moieties, respectively [12], [15]. MERS-CoV utilizes the CTD as its RBD to bind the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of permissive cells [16], [17]. As the RBD contains major neutralization epitopes and induces most of the host immune responses [12], most studies have focused on the RBD [18], [19], [20], [21] for the development of a vaccine against MERS-CoV infection [22], [23], [24], [25]. However, rRBD vaccination induced only partial protection against the MERS-CoV challenge in mice or non-human primates (NHPs) [19], [26]. Additionally, the nature of the rapid variation in the RNA virus increases the likelihood of immunologic escape, especially with regard to countermeasures directed at the RBD. Therefore, developing a different immunogen to replace or use in combination with the RBD as a vaccine candidate is a promising strategy against MERS-CoV infection.",

When diluted to 1:80 or 1:160, the sera from the NTD-immunized mice showed significant difference in neutralizing activity compared with the RBD protein. Therefore, the rNTD protein induced effective neutralization antibodies (PRNT50\n = 1:40) in mice, and the titer of neutralization antibodies was lower than that obtained with the same dose of rRBD protein (PRNT50\n = 1:160).",

In contrast, milder lesions were observed in mice immunized with rNTD or rRBD, as the pulmonary alveolus was highly visible with lower infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig.5B and C). Similarly, compared with the control group, mice immunized with the recombinant protein showed slightly lower pathologic damage to the trachea (Fig.5D\u2013F). As shown in Fig. 6\n, IHC revealed that the MERS-CoV antigen was located mainly in the trachea. Additionally, MERS-CoV expression was detected in the lung tissue of all immunized groups.

In this study, the rNTD protein located on the N terminal of S protein was investigated as a potential prophylactic vaccine against MERS-CoV infection. Our data showed that rNTD vaccination induced a sustained significant titer of IgG and neutralizing activity in the sera of immunized mice, although the titers were not as high as that found in rRBD-immunized mice as assessed by PRNT assay. Additionally, robust and functional T-cell-mediated immunity was achieved in rNTD-vaccinated mice, which was much higher than that in rRBD-vaccinated mice. This effect might be attributable to the prominent T-cell epitope located on the NTD, as Zhao et al. [31] showed KYYSIIPHSI (located in NTD) comprised the potential CD8+ T-cell epitope of the MERS-CoV S protein. Previously, we verified that the S protein peptide TIKYYSIIPHSIRSIQSD, located at aa residues 289\u2013306, was the strongest T-cell epitope (supplementary Fig. 1) among 161 peptide pools overlapping with the S protein of MERS-CoV in BALB/c mice. As cytokines play an important role in the clearance of viruses in the body, we evaluated the expression of various cytokines in the rNTD-immunized mice using ICS and CBA assays. ICS revealed that rNTD vaccination elicited high levels of IL-2-positive CD4+ T-cells and IFN-\u03b3-positive CD8+ T-cells in splenocytes, and CBA revealed evidence of a Th1, Th2, and Th17 T-cell response. As treatment with IFN improved the outcome in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques [35], [36], we investigated whether rNTD-immunized mice benefited from the IFN-\u03b3 detected by ICS and CBA in the splenocytes of mice.",

As a control, the rRBD-immunized mice were challenged with MERS-CoV. The reduced abnormalities in the lung and trachea in recombinant protein-immunized mice suggested that either the rNTD or rRBD induced effective protection against the MERS-CoV infection in mice. Although both the rNTD and rRBD proteins induced significant immunity in mice, the orientation of the immunologic response differed in the two models. The rRBD protein induced a higher level of neutralizing activity by PRNT assay, whereas the rNTD protein induced a higher CMI level than did the rRBD. The challenge results showed that both rRBD and rNTD proteins could partially protect the immunized mice against MERS-CoV infection. The immunity protection elicited by the rNTD protein coincided with that elicited by the rRBD protein, suggesting that both the T-cell and antibody responses contributed to MERS-CoV clearance, a finding supported by other studies. Zhao et al. [31] showed no clearance of MERS-CoV in mice that lacked T-cells or in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease. In contrast, MERS-CoV was cleared in B cell-deficient mice, suggesting that T-cells were important for acute virus clearance. Additionally, the authors showed the accelerated kinetics of virus clearance in Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice immunized with sera from Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particles expressing the MERS-CoV S protein, proving that the anti-S antibody blockage of virus attachment was largely sufficient for the MERS-CoV clearance effect. Finally, the study concluded that T-cells and antibodies were required for MERS-CoV clearance and protection from subsequent challenge.",

First, the mechanism of neutralization by rNTD vaccination in mice is unknown and requires further investigation. For example, the nature of the neutralization antibodies detected by the pseudovirus neutralization assay and PRNT assay remains unclear. Second, pathological lesions and antigen expression indicated by IHC were detected after the mice challenged by MERS-CoV, although significant humoral and cellular immunity was elicited by the rNTD vaccination. Whether this was the result of a memory response need further study. Additionally, the limitations of the animal models restricted the assessment of the protective efficacy of rNTD vaccine in mice [37]. The MERS-CoV infection animal model used in this study was developed by transducing mice with an adenovirus vector expressing human DPP4 [31]. MERS-CoV infection in this model is highly dependent on the transduction of cells and the level of DPP4 expression from the adenovirus vector; therefore, the model may not reflect the natural disease process [38]. Additionally, the 5-day animal model imposed the limitation that the viral titer data could not be collected for further investigation of the immune system response following clearance of the virus after rNTD vaccination in the mice. Other animal models, such as the transgenic mouse, might overcome this shortcoming. Whereas several studies have developed transgenic mouse models of MERS-CoV infection [39], [40], the non-specific damage and virus detection in the brain of transgenic mice restricted the application of the model. Other small animal models, such as ferrets [41], immune-deficient mice [42], or hamsters [43], were not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.",

Thus, most investigators screen vaccines in small animal models first, and such screenings can prompt subsequent primate studies [44]. Several previous studies reported SARS vaccine candidates that elicited neutralizing antibodies and showed effectiveness in protecting young mice or hamsters from challenge [45], [46], [47], [48], [49]. However, reports of immunopathologic reactions in older mice and in NHPs vaccinated with SARS-CoV vaccines that were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [50], [51], [52] raised concerns of vaccine-associated disease enhancement before performing clinical trials with SARS-CoV vaccines [45]. Similar concerns have been reported in the vaccine-associated disease enhancement of feline infectious peritonitis virus [45], [53] and respiratory syncytial virus [54] vaccines. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the protection of the rNTD protein vaccine in a NHP model before applying it to humans to protect against MERS-CoV infection. Although there are many limitations, the rhesus macaque [55], [56] and common marmoset [57] have been developed as the NHP animal models of MERS-CoV infection.",
