            "text": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that is characterized by a specific inflammatory cell response resulting in a swollen, edematous, hyper-reactive airway. For certain patients, asthma is punctuated by frequent acute exacerbations and some patients deteriorate alarmingly into one of the critical asthma syndromes (CAS). Modern therapy and research has focused on the trigger of the inflammatory response in asthma but few treatments are directed at vasculature of the airway and parenchyma, most notably diuretics. Blood vessels in the airway wall and lung parenchyma serve as the highways for inflammatory cells. These highways can be more abundant in the airways of chronic asthma patients and they may also express adhesion molecules that allow for easier translocation of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and in certain cases neutrophils. In fact, primary inflammation of the vasculature with vascular leak can present as a severe asthma phenotype. More recently, certain viral syndromes have triggered acute, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in asthma patients, highlighting the potential role of vascular leak from parenchymal vasculature in the pathogenesis of CAS.",

            "text": "The structure, growth, and proliferation of blood vessels in the lung can be associated with CAS in a variety of ways. The blood vessels can be the primary target of the disease as is seen in EGPA. Patient with EGPA often present clinically as a CAS. In EGPA, the pulmonary circulation is the primary target of disease activity and may be associated with parenchymal lung involvement as well as non-pulmonary involvement. Similarly, certain viral syndromes may affect the lung parenchyma and pulmonary circulation, and present as a CAS. This is perhaps best illustrated by the cohort of patients that were infected by the H1N1 virus resulting in an ARDS-like presentation. As in EGPA patients, patient with severe H1N1 complicating their asthma often presented with severe gas exchange abnormalities, reflecting the large surface area of the lung affected. In contrast, chronic asthma is associated with a distinct remodeling of the conducting airway, including an increase in density of the sub-mucosal vasculature. Patients presenting with a CAS have been demonstrated to have an increased density of airway vasculature as well as an increase in biomarkers of vascular remodeling. What percentage of CAS is secondary to remodeling of airway or parenchymal vasculature is not known. Finally, the role of vascular remodeling in shaping the cluster phenotypes of asthma is also not clear, and presents and excellent opportunity for further research.",
