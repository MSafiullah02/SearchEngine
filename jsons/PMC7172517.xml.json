            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infection is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. In most cases, viruses including influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are the causative agents. Recently, a new respiratory tract virus of the Parvoviridae family, Human Bocavirus (HBoV), has been discovered applying molecular analysis on pooled respiratory tract aspirations taken from children in Sweden. This virus is closely related to the bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus, which have been classified as members of the genus Bocavirus. The virus comprises two major open reading frames (ORFs) encoding a nonstructural protein (NS1) and at least two capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2), respectively. Moreover, the HBoV genome also contains a third middle ORF encoding a nonstructural protein (NP1) of unknown function.1 The most conserved region of this virus is the NS1 and NP1 gene whereas the VP1/VP2 gene constitutes the variable region.2 The induction of respiratory illness by HBoV is not clearly defined due to lack of propagation techniques in cell culture or animal models.1 However, many studies have reported this virus infection to be associated with acute respiratory illness.1, 3, 4 Upon discovery of HBoV in respiratory pools, its global prevalence has been reported to range from 1.5% to 19% and co-infection with other viruses was commonly found.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Moreover, in few studies were shown negative results for HBoV infection in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from healthy volunteers.20, 25, 26 Additional epidemiological and clinical investigation will be essential in order to elucidate what exactly engenders HBoV related illness. Therefore, in the present study we applied polymerase chain reaction to detect HBoV from NP suctions collected from infants or children who had been admitted with respiratory tract illness.",

            "text": "In the past few years, applying molecular techniques has led to the discovery of HBoV as a novel virus apparently associated with respiratory tract illness in humans.1 However, due to lack of suitable culture systems and animal models to propagate the virus previous studies could not meet with Koch's postulates in order to clarify that HBoV can cause respiratory illness. It can be concluded from epidemiology data that HBoV has been distributed throughout every continent with a different incidence rate (1.5% to 19%). In this study, the NP suctions had been collected from pediatric patients hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract illness. HBoV has been detected in 20 (6.62%) out of 302 NP suction samples, whereas the previous study in the rural area of Thailand had the prevalence of 4.5%.18 Co-infection with other respiratory viruses was found in 40% of the samples tested. RSV and parainfluenza virus were frequently detected as co-infecting viruses. However, some of the respiratory viruses were not included in this study, for examples; rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. Therefore, the percentage of co-infection may be higher than this report. Thailand has a tropical climate country and seasonal detection of HBoV can not be deduced from the few (1\u20133) HBoV-positive samples found in each month. RSV and hMPV were shown the seasonal distribution that peaked in July to September which correlated to the number of samples collection (data not shown). Moreover, the study of Mannig et al. reported a similarity in seasonal appearance between HBoV and RSV12 whereas Weissbrich et al. did not.16 The clinical features commonly found in HBoV positive patients were fever and productive cough. Bilateral rales and wheezing were among the most common abnormal lung signs observed and almost equally found in these patients (Table 1). These findings might indicate both lung parenchyma and airway involvement by this pathogen. Furthermore, the detection of this virus in specimens aspirated from the nasopharynx together with the significant lower respiratory tract illness indicated the lung pathology in these patients.",
