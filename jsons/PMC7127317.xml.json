Although this approach helps to provide an understanding of the risk factors and explain the cause of the disease, the diagnostic ability to identify or even influence some of these factors is not always apparent.

These lymphocytes may survive for a period of time in the intestinal lumen but may also penetrate the mucosa and find residence in the mesenteric lymph nodes. This transfer may allow for cell-mediated immunity to be passed to the newborn from the dam. Archambault and colleagues12 reported that cell-mediated immune transfer to neonates could be enhanced by maternal vaccination. Although Donovan and colleagues13 showed that transfer of live maternal cells from colostrum to neonatal calves enhanced responses to antigens against which the dams had previously responded (BVDV), but not to antigens to which the dams were naive, our complete understanding of the role of lymphocyte transfer is still not clear. What is clear is there is no true substitute for the passage of maternal immunity from dam to the neonate. Colostral supplements, substitutes, and frozen colostrum, although valuable as an addition to fresh colostrum, cannot match the quality of the dam's fresh colostrum.14\n",

Dewell and colleagues1 showed that quantitative differences in passive transfer may result in differences in outcomes of disease and performance. Calves with serum IgG1 levels up to 2500 mg/dL were 1.5 times more likely to get sick before weaning and 2.4 times more likely to die before weaning than calves with higher IgG1 levels. Calves need to acquire as much protection as possible from the dam's colostrum. Anything less than maximum absorption seems to increase health and performance risk.",

            "text": "Calving ease is an important genetic trait that affects passive transfer via stress level at birth. Besser and colleagues19 reported that calves experiencing dystocia had lower absorption of IgG1 from colostrum associated with respiratory acidosis. Calves born after experiencing calving difficulty have a physiologic acidosis. In addition, increased calving difficulty is associated with extended time to nursing.20 Because time to first nursing is associated with efficiency of absorption, this too is a factor related to efficiency of passive transfer. It is important to recognize the role of calving ease in the equation of long-term health of calves. A second genetic trait associated with passive transfer is that of udder and teat conformation. The mechanics of transfer are critical to passive transfer, that is, teat size and length, and udder attachment. Goonewardene and colleagues21 reported that pendulous udders coupled with large teat size can complicate the suckling process. This situation reduces the probability of good immune transfer, which increases the risk of clinical disease and decrease growth rates. A third genetic trait is the selection for increased growth rates in calves. Muggli and colleagues22 reported that calves from Hereford lines selected for performance had lower IgG1 concentration than calves from the randomly selected control line. Field observations seem to support this research observation. Herds with selection pressure exclusively on performance tend to experience a higher level of clinical disease, often in the form of respiratory disease. The reason for this may not be evident; however, it may seem logical that selection for performance also leads to an increase in birth weight, calving difficulty, longer period of time to standing and nursing, or perhaps greater milk production leading to a higher incidence of mastitis or udder and teat problems, thus leading to decreased absorption of immunity.",

Although this is an important part of prevention and treatment strategies, the cause may be more symptomatic rather than a major risk factor, particularly as it applies to secondary bacterial pathogens. Most cow/calf herds are maintained in multiple pasture units on a single operation. Exposure within these units to potential pathogens is common. In many herds, pathogens such as BRSV have likely become endemic and are not likely to cause significant clinical disease in well-vaccinated herds. In herd situations with exposure to BVDV persistent infection (PI) animals in the absence of other risk factors may result in clinical disease.34 Exposure to cattle from other operations may present a pathogen risk because naive cattle exposed to the common viral pathogens such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), BRSV, BVDV, and BRCV as well as the bacterial pathogen such as Mycoplasma bovis\n35, 36 may cause clinical disease in the absence of other apparent risk factors. The risk posed by these viral pathogens is readily reduced by herd vaccination programs. The use of modified live virus (MLV) vaccines greatly decreases shedding of these viruses and reduces the risk of clinical disease. The pathogen previously characterized as Pasteurella trehalosi and recently renamed Bibersteinia trehalosi has long been recognized as a cause of ovine respiratory disease in small ruminants.37, 38 Its role in acute cases of respiratory disease in young dairy and stocker calves seems to be increasing and may be influenced by the use of prophylactic antibiotics given to control other pathogens.39 Vaccination to control bacterial pathogens gives mixed results in the field. This finding could be due to timing of vaccination, not given before pathogen exposure, lack of booster doses, and lack of attention to the primary causative risk factors.",

Weaning weights are generally assumed to be less with any clinical disease such as calf scours. With respiratory disease the assumption is that weaning weights are reduced by as much as 15.87 kg (35 pounds) on average.7 This loss does not include treatment costs or time and labor associated with treatment or death loss. If the value of gain at the calf level until weaning is approximately $1.10/kg ($0.50/pound), then a loss of weaning weight of 15.87 kg (35 pounds) would be worth $17.50. If treatment costs including labor are $20/calf, and assuming no death loss, then the cost of one calf needing treatment would be $37.50. If the percentage of calves becoming ill during the suckling phase is 10%, then the cost of illness for each calf in the herd would be $3.75. When death loss occurs and is included in this calculation the cost of illness increases dramatically. If the value of each calf lost is equal to the cost of keeping a cow on an annual basis (eg, $500), then each 1% death loss increases the cost of respiratory disease for each surviving calf by $5.00/calf. Thus, if the percentage of calves needing treatment is 10% and death loss is 1%, then the total cost of respiratory disease would be $8.75 for each surviving calf. With proper herd health management, attention to common risk factors, and the use of specific vaccines most herd outbreaks of respiratory disease in suckling calves can be reduced or prevented.",

The addition of viral vaccines and bacterins to prevent respiratory disease is also now commonly included. Their efficacy has come under some scrutiny as even in well-vaccinated herds cases of respiratory disease may still occur. Vaccines are given to prevent clinical disease and pathogen transmission caused by specific pathogens. IBR vaccine is given to prevent IBR. It is not possible to vaccinate against every pathogen known to cause respiratory disease. Nor do all vaccines provide equal levels of protection or efficacy. It becomes critical to prioritize vaccines given to young calves. To do this the veterinarian must have a guiding principle regarding vaccination. It is helpful to ask 3 questions:1.Is there a substantial risk of disease caused by a specific pathogen?2.Is there a commercial vaccine that has shown efficacy against the specific pathogen?3.Does management of the herd allow for the proper use of the vaccine within the constraints of handling times?\n",

With BHV-1, the antibody response in the presence of antibody is negligible; however, on receiving a second dose even months later the response was greater than calves receiving their initial dose at this same time.44 In BVDV, the literature is less clearly defined.45, 46, 47 What is clear is that calves without maternal immunity to BVDV can respond to MLV vaccine, whereas at higher levels of maternal antibody, antibody production is blocked and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses are primed.48 Vaccination of young calves with BRSV has shown a CMI response in the presence of maternal antibody.49 In a recent study intranasal vaccination with BRSV showed protection against BRSV challenge as measured by virus shedding.50 The data indicate that young beef calves can respond to vaccination, and response as measured by antibody production is affected in the presence of maternal immunity. A population of memory cells can be generated and when either vaccination or exposure occurs, immunization has provided a degree of protection not seen in nonvaccinated animals.",

After using 2 different vaccines it was estimated that Ro was 2.4 and 1.1.59 This finding means that within a susceptible population, 2.4 or 1.1 new cases will arise from 1 case. In this immunized population transmission cannot effectively be prevented. Within real populations these numbers must be considered within the context that as animals become infected and are contagious, the number of susceptible animals declines and the number of recovered and immune animals increases. It has been estimated that the critical proportion of immune animals is expressed by the equation critical proportion = 1 \u2212 1/Ro. The higher the Ro the greater the number of animals that must be immune to prevent spread of the infectious agent. If Ro = 7.0 for a specific pathogen, then the proportion of immune animals within that population must be 1 \u2212 (1/7). This calculation means that approximately 86% of the population must be immune to prevent transmission. Estimates for limiting the spread of BVDV within a population have been made based on mathematical models. In herds without PI animals, 57% of the animals must be immune to stop transmission. For herds with animals that are persistently infected with BVDV, 97% must be immune.60 This issue of herd immunity to BVDV is further complicated by the amount of cross-protection afforded by commercial vaccines, as strain differences can exist between vaccine virus and wild virus.61 A sound recommendation for vaccines can be made based only on actual challenge model and field trials using sound science and proper design.",

In addition, veterinarians must have a working knowledge of the relative efficacy, duration of immunity, and the effect on transmission of the available commercial vaccines. With this as a working tool, the veterinarian can use the concept of population dynamics and herd immunity when making specific herd recommendations regarding the timing and frequency of vaccination administration.62\n",
