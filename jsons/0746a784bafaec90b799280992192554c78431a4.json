This study aimed to assess the joint action of treatment time and exposure to methamidophos on the male reproductive system. MET was orally administered to adult male Swiss mice at a dose of 0.004 mg.kg -1 for 15 and 50 consecutive days. The following parameters were evaluated: weight of reproductive organs, spermatogenesis, sperm and Sertoli cell count, daily sperm production and sperm transit time. Short-term J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 exposure to methamidophos induced a decrease in epididymal weight. The frequency of stages V-VI of spermatogenesis increased and the frequency of stage IX decreased. In the epididymis, sperm transit time (caput/corpus) was reduced and the relative sperm number (cauda) increased. Long-term exposure induced an increase in the frequencies of stages I-IV and V-VI and decreased the stages VII-VIII and IX.",

These reproductive changes caused by contact with MET may compromise the survival of the exposed species. In this context, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of the joint action of treatment time and exposure to methamidophos on the weight of reproductive organs (testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles), the dynamics of spermatogenesis, daily sperm production (DSP), the Sertoli cell number with evident nucleoli in the germinal epithelium and sperm transit time in the epididymis of adult Swiss mice.",

Long-term treatment also reduced the spermiation stages (VII-VIII), which are essential in the dynamics of spermatogenesis. Spermiation is the final stage of spermatogenesis and involves the release of the spermatozoa from the Sertoli cell into the lumen of the seminiferous epithelium. This process is also related to the transfer of spermatozoa to the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f epididymis [30] . The reduction of these stages results in there being less spermatozoa available for fertilization. Farag et al.

These results are consistent with the normal testes weight. However, it is interesting to note that both the relative number of mature spermatids and relative DSP were higher (44%) in the MET group compared to the control group during short-term exposure. Our data showed that the mitotic stages (responsible for sperm cell proliferation) are more susceptible to short-term MET exposure, evidenced by the elevated number of stages V-VI (stages preceding spermiation). This result may explain the increase in the testicular sperm counts and DSP in the short-term exposure group.",

It is possible, therefore, that the sperm transit reduction in the caput/corpus epididymis in METtreated mice in the short-term exposure group is a result of excess ACh in mAChR. These receptors are expressed in different cell types in the epididymides of rodents and are involved in the modulation of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f smooth muscle contraction and epithelial cell activity [26, 27] . Thus, hyperstimulation of the mAChR and cholinergic overload may have increased contractility and promoted the release of spermatozoa from the epididymis. However, although not statistically significant, the sperm number in the caput/corpus was 23% lower in the MET group (2.8 \u00b1 0.3) when compared to the control group (3.7 \u00b1 0.7) following shortcourse treatment. This reduction may also have influenced the acceleration of sperm transit time.",

In turn, the speed of the spermatozoa release from the caput/corpus epididymis can explain the increase in the relative sperm count of the cauda epididymis following short-term exposure to MET, which may also have prevented an additional reduction in the weight of this tissue, as discussed earlier.",

In the long-term treatment, there was an increase in stages I-IV (F(1,34) = 57.165; P < 0.001; Fig. 3A) and a reduction in stages VII-VIII (F(1,34) = 5.012; P < 0.05; Fig. 3C) and X-XI (F(1,34) = 13.816; P < 0.001; Fig. 3E).

(A) Factorial ANOVA and Tukey post-test, (B) GLZ (Poisson, Identity), * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.001, # P < 0.001. Events occurring before and after MET action. (1) An arriving action potential depolarizes the presynaptic neuron; (2) Ca 2+ ions enter the cytoplasm; (3) After a brief delay, acetylcholine (ACh) is released through the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles; (4) ACh binds to muscarinic receptors (mAChR) in the postsynaptic membrane and activates Gq protein. This event increases phospholipase C (PLC) activity, which degrades membrane phospholipids into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 leads to release of intracellular Ca 2+ . DAG has a role in the late (tonic) phase of the cell response; (5) In the nicotinic receptors (nAChR), ACh promotes a graded depolarization of postsynaptic membrane with Na + input. This event results in cell response; (6) ACh action ceases when it is broken down into acetate and choline by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme; (7) Choline reuptake occurs from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic neuron, being used to synthesize new molecules of ACh; (8) Methamidophos (MET) inhibits AChE and prolongs duration of ACh at the synaptic terminals.",
