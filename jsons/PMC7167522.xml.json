Clinical TipEquipment used during physical therapy treatments for patients with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (e.g., MRSA, VRE, or MDR-AB), such as assistive devices, gait belts, cuff weights, or goniometers, should be left in the patient's room and not be taken out until the infection is resolved.

Other risk factors include underlying chronic pulmonary disease, smoking history, and age greater than 50 years. Legionellosis is transmitted by inhalation of aerosolized organisms from infected water sources, such as air-conditioning cooling towers for large buildings including hospitals. Additional examples of infected hospital water sources have included shower heads, tap water from respiratory devices, ice machines, decorative fountains, and even distilled water.3, 58, 59, 60\n",

Rotavirus and norovirus are by far the most frequent cause of gastroenteritis; adenovirus and astrovirus also commonly cause gastroenteritis, especially in children. Transmission of both bacterial and viral gastroenteritis is usually through the ingestion of contaminated food, water, or both or by direct and indirect fecal-oral transmission. Clinical TipStrict contact and enteric precautions should be observed with patients who have a diagnosis of C. difficile (whose spores can persist on fomites and environmental surfaces for months) and norovirus infection because these pathogens are relatively resistant to waterless alcohol-based antiseptics, and they have been associated with frequent surface contamination in hospital rooms and the hands of health care workers.\n",

In the United States, 50% of gastroenteritis pediatric cases requiring hospitalization or emergency room visits are caused by rotavirus, and the total health and societal costs of rotavirus infections are estimated to exceed $1 billion per year. Fortunately, the annual pediatric death rate in the United States is relatively low (20 to 60 deaths). Rotavirus is very contagious in that the virus can survive on dry surfaces for up to 10 days and on human hands for up to 4 hours. It also has a low infectious dose (10 or fewer particles) and the infected stool can contain up to 1011 particles per gram that are present before and up to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Because of its highly contagious nature, it is estimated that for every 4 children admitted to the hospital with a rotavirus infection, 1 additional child acquires it as an HAI. Rotavirus infections also may be transmitted to adults who are around infected children, immunocompromised individuals, and older adults in nursing homes. Fortunately, the newly developed second-generation rotavirus vaccines have proven to be effective and have fewer serious side effects (e.g., intussusception [intestinal invagination]).78, 79, 80, 81\n",

This procedure tests for the presence of antibodies to HIV proteins in the patient's serum. A sample of the patient's blood is exposed to HIV antigens in the test reagent. If HIV antibodies are identified, it is inferred that the virus is present within the patient.2.Western blot test. This test detects the presence of antibodies in the blood of two types of HIV viral proteins and is therefore a more specific HIV test. It is an expensive test to perform and is used as a confirmatory tool for a positive ELISA test.3.Immunofluorescence assay. In this test, the patient's blood is diluted and placed on a slide containing HIV antigens. The slide is then treated with anti-human globulin mixed with a fluorescent dye that will bind to antigen-antibody complexes. If fluorescence is visible when the specimen is placed under a microscope, then HIV antibodies are present in the patient's blood.4.p24 antigen assay. This test analyzes blood cells for the presence of the p24 antigen located on HIV virions. It can be used to diagnose acute infection, to screen blood for HIV antigens, to determine HIV infection in difficult diagnostic cases, or to evaluate the treatment effects of antiviral agents.5.PCR for HIV nucleic acid. This highly specific and extremely sensitive test detects viral DNA molecule in lymphocyte nuclei by amplifying the viral DNA. It is used to detect HIV in neonates and when antibody tests are inconclusive.6.Rapid HIV testing. This highly sensitive and specific test requires a sample of blood, serum, plasma, or oral fluid to detect HIV antibodies. This test can be complete in 20 minutes.\n Clinical TipAny clinician who sustains a needle-stick injury when working with a patient with a suspected HIV infection should have an HIV test. A false-negative HIV test can occur if an individual has not yet developed HIV antibodies. If an individual has had exposure to HIV, he or she should have a repeat HIV test to ensure a true negative result.93\n\n",

Exercise and adequate rest are key factors in promoting a healthy psychological state, which also reduces the negative effects of stress (e.g., high levels of cortisol) on the immune system. However, it should be mentioned that the beneficial effects of resistive exercise (as opposed to cardiovascular exercise) on immunity are less clear, though excessive cardiovascular exercise may lead to immunosuppression. The key role that the crucial rest-promoting hormone melatonin plays in influencing our circadian rhythm (sleep-wake cycle) and immune system (specifically T cell populations) is still being unraveled. Melatonin's peak production occurs at night, which is the inverse of another key immunoregulatory hormone, vitamin D. In order to maximize melatonin levels, which promote sleep efficiency and restfulness, one should exercise regularly, be exposed to natural light (sunlight) especially early in the day, minimize exposure to artificial light at night, and go to bed 2 to 3 hours before midnight in a completely dark room. It is important to follow this advice every day because melatonin has a short half-life and thus must be produced every 24 hours.110, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119\n",

Be sure to scrub the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.3.Continue rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds (as previously mentioned, some pathogens such as norovirus require a longer time of at least 60 seconds to remove stool contamination from hands).4.Rinse your hands well under running water (stool-contaminated norovirus hands should be rinsed for at least 20 seconds).5.Dry your hands using a clean disposable towel or air dry.\nIf soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (continue to rub the sanitizer over all hand and finger surfaces until dry). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of pathogens, but do not remove all pathogen types (e.g., norovirus, Clostridium difficile spores).2.Personally follow and also educate patients concerning proper coughing and sneezing hygiene etiquette in order to prevent the spread of disease and illness.a.Cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.b.Put the used tissue in a waste basket.c.If no tissue is available, cough or sneeze into the upper sleeve and not into the hands.d.Wash the hands after coughing or sneezing (see Box 13-2 on previous page).\n3.The danger of pathogen aerosolization during common hygiene activities and physical therapy treatment is often not fully recognized.a.Flushing the toilet (even with the lid down) causes aerosolization of pathogens that is greatest with the first flush, and then diminishes with each subsequent flush.b.Aerosolization danger is greatest when the patient has diarrhea (as contrasted to a normal stool) and/or vomits into the toilet.c.Gastroenteritis viral pathogens are especially easy to spread in the foregoing manner because each gram of feces can contain up to 1011 virus particles.d.Pulsatile lavage is a common wound physical therapy modality that can cause aerosolization of pathogens.e.In addition to the therapist wearing appropriate PPE during pulsatile lavage, patients receiving treatment should wear surgical masks, and all IV lines and other wounds should be covered during treatment. The procedure should be performed in a private room, with minimal equipment and supplies. The room should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after each procedure.\n4.Patients who have infectious processes have an elevated metabolic rate, which will most likely manifest itself as a high resting heart rate. As a result, the activity intensity level should be modified, or more frequent rest periods should be incorporated during physical therapy treatment to enhance activity tolerance.a.Patients with infectious processes will also be prone to orthostatic hypotension, hypotension with functional activities, or both as a result of the vasodilation occurring from the inflammation associated with infection.b.Therefore slow changes in positions, especially from recumbent to upright positions, and frequent blood pressure monitoring are essential to promoting tolerance for functional activities.\n5.Monitoring the temperature curve and WBC count of patients with infectious processes helps to determine the appropriateness of physical therapy intervention.a.During an exacerbation or progression of an infection process, rest may be indicated.b.Clarification with the physician or nurse regarding the type of intended physical therapy intervention is helpful in making this decision.\n\n",
