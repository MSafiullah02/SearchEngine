These proteins can be found across a wide variety of different species in nature, including prokaryotes, sea corals, algae, fungi, higher plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates.1, 2, 3 As also synthetic agents with carbohydrate\u2010binding capacity have been identified, the term carbohydrate\u2010binding agent (CBA) was introduced to include both the peptidic lectins and the non\u2010peptidic low\u2010molecular\u2010weight agents. Binding of the CBAs to N\u2010linked glycans of glycoproteins predominantly occurs via mannose, glucose, fucose, N\u2010acetylglucosamine, galactose, N\u2010acetylgalactosamine, and/or sialic acid residues. The internal linkages between the individual monosaccharides of an N\u2010linked glycan play an important role in the specificity of binding of a CBA. The human immune system takes advantage of the presence of the dense glycan shield that surrounds certain pathogens. Various C\u2010type lectins, such as DC\u2010SIGN on dendritic cells (DC), the mannose receptor MMR on macrophages, the soluble mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL) found in plasma and several more, bind the oligosaccharides on the surface of viruses and bacteria in order to remove them and in the case of antigen\u2010presenting cells, present the foreign epitopes to CD4+ T cells to provoke an efficient immune response against the pathogen. However, as will be discussed further in this review, some pathogens such as HIV\u20101 try to circumvent such eradication and use these C\u2010type lectins of the innate immune system to gain easily access to the lymph nodes populated with CD4+ T lymphocytes.",

Moreover, CBAs not only prevent the virus from entry into its target host cell, but long\u2010term drug pressure results in the selection of virus strains in which several N\u2010linked glycans that constitute the protective glycan shield around the viral particles were deleted. As this shield masks important immunogenic epitopes of the viral envelope and often protects the virus against recognition and eradication by neutralizing antibodies of the immune system, CBAs might have the potential to assist the immune system in containing the viral infection. This dual mode of action might also work against other glycan\u2010containing enveloped viruses, as in the case of flaviviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV),6 coronaviruses like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV)7 and other Nidovirales.8 Thus, for CBAs to become efficient antiviral compounds, they need to be able to inhibit this specific interaction between viruses and lectins of the immune system that are used by the virus for transmission and establishment of the infection.",

Gp120 first binds to the cellular receptor CD4, undergoes a conformational change and then binds to the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. This binding triggers other conformational changes, resulting in the insertion of the fusion peptide of gp41 in the cellular membrane and eventual fusion of the virus with the cell. Around 18\u201333 (average \u223c24) N\u2010glycosylation motifs (N\u2010X\u2010T/S, where X is not proline) can be found in the gp120 sequence, and it was shown by Leonard et al.9 that all motifs are occupied by a glycan. Moreover, 11 oligosaccharides were determined to be high\u2010mannose type or hybrid type, while 13 were complex type. This is a remarkable ratio in favor of high\u2010mannose type glycans, because viruses derive their glycans through the glycosylation machinery of the host cell. Such a high density of high\u2010mannose type glycans has never been observed on mammalian glycoproteins. Therefore, we might expect neutralization of HIV\u20101 by the mannose\u2010specific lectins of the innate immune system, such as by the MBL, but the opposite is true. As we will discuss further in this review, host lectins bind HIV presumably through the high\u2010mannose type glycans but HIV uses this event for survival and to escape destruction by the immune system.",

HCV is an enveloped RNA virus classified within the family of Flaviviridae. Infection of HCV often leads to chronic disease such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.10 The major site of replication is the liver, but other cell types, such as monocytes and macrophages, were also reported to become infected with HCV.11 Four cellular receptors have already been identified, all of which are required at the same time for HCV\u2010entry to occur.12 HCV encodes two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2 (reviewed in13). E1 contains up to six potential N\u2010glycosylation sites, while E2 can contain up to 11 N\u2010glycans. However, due to a proline immediately downstream of the consensus sequence, one of the potential N\u2010glycosylation sites of E1 is not recognized by the oligosaccharyltransferase.14 All 11 potential glycosylation motifs were occupied with high\u2010mannose type glycans, except for positions N41 and 48, where a complex type glycan was found.15 It is thought that the E2 glycoprotein is responsible for initiating virus attachment,16, 17 while the E1 glycoprotein is responsible for fusion of the virus with the cell membrane.18, 19\n",

Upon maturation of the virus particle prM is cleaved to M. The envelope E protein forms the shell of the virus, and changes conformation during the immature, mature, and fusion\u2010activated state of the virion (reviewed in22 and references therein). In contrast with other members of the Flaviviridae family, the E glycoprotein of DENV contains only 2 N\u2010linked glycosylation sites. Asn153 is conserved among all flaviviruses while Asn67 is unique for DENV.23 It is postulated that the N\u2010linked glycan at position 67 is high\u2010mannose type, while the oligosaccharide at position N153 is pauci\u2010mannose type, a glycan type that can be abundantly found on insect cell glycans,24 but also in plants.25, 26\n",

Influenza type A viruses can be categorized based on the properties of the two membrane glycoproteins (spikes), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).30 To date, there are 9 different HA and 15 different NA variants known. Between different virus subtypes the amino acid sequence of HA can vary up to 70%. HA plays a major role in influenza virus entry. After binding of HA to the terminal sialic acids of the epithelial receptor, the virus is taken up by endocytosis. The low pH in the endosomes activates fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes (reviewed in30). HA is synthesized as a precursor HA0, and is cleaved to generate HA1 and HA2. Both HA1 and HA2 are glycosylated, but among subtypes the variation in glycosylation is more extensive in HA1 than in HA2, where glycosylation is more conserved.31 Intensive study of the oligosaccharides on HA of fowl plague virus suggested the presence of seven N\u2010linked glycans, five of which are complex type, one proved high\u2010mannose type, and one hybrid type.32 However, the number and structure of the glycans vary greatly among different influenza A subtypes and even during virus evolution in time.",

Third, many viruses use the host glycosylation machinery for the glycosylation of their envelope glycoproteins. The host will recognize these structures as \u201cself\u201d, not as \u201cforeign\u201d. Site\u2010directed mutagenesis studies have implicated that the epitope of 2G12 consists of the Man\u03b11\u20102Man\u2010linked residues of the N\u2010linked oligosaccharides at amino acid positions N295, N332, and N392, while the glycans at positions N386 and N448 play an indirect role in the conservation of the epitope conformation.147 However, the 3D structure indicates that 2G12 rather binds at amino acid positions N332, N339, and N392 of gp120.148 The glycan at position N295 may play an indirect role in 2G12 binding by preventing further processing of the glycan at position N332 and by maintaining its oligmannose structure as one that is recognized by 2G12.",

They are all derived from an ancestral gene that existed before reptiles and birds diverged.157 The \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010defensins are most widely distributed among mammalian, and have been studied in detail (see review158). The \u03b8\u2010defensins (also called minidefensins) are the smallest cyclic peptides of animal origin known so far. They are 18 residues big, derived from two precursor peptides, each of which contributes nine residues to the mature peptide. Three rhesus monkey \u03b8\u2010defensins were first discovered when it became clear that human bone marrow also expresses the mRNA that is homologous to the precursors of rhesus monkey circular minidefensins. However, a stop codon in the signal sequence silences transcription.159 Based on the sequence of the human gene, the putative ancestral human circular minidefensin was synthesized and called \u201cretrocyclin\u201d. Retrocyclin could protect human CD4+ cells from HIV\u20101 infection in vitro.159, 160 Based on SPR experiments, it was concluded that retrocyclin binds glycosylated gp120, suggesting it is a lectin.161 Later on, also the human \u03b1\u2010defensins HNP1, HNP2, and HNP3 were shown to bind to glycosylated gp120.162 However, retrocyclin was shown to bind to gp41 in a non\u2010carbohydrate manner and inhibit the formation of the 6\u2010helix bundle during HIV\u20101 fusion,163 making it a fusion inhibitor, and it was shown that \u03b1\u2010defensins dramatically downregulate the expression of CD4 on the cell surface. Therefore, \u03b1\u2010defensins inhibit the interaction between gp120 and CD4.164 Finally, \u03b2\u2010defensins are also able to inhibit HIV\u20101 X4 and R5, but its antiviral mode of action is based on modulation of the CXCR4 coreceptor, and no lectin\u2010like properties are attributed to this defensin.165\n",

Some of them are potential candidates as anti\u2010HIV microbicides, but the size of the protein, the antigenic properties, their peptidic nature, sensitivity to proteases, and problems associated with large\u2010scale production and purification make them less qualified for systemic use. Synthetic compounds with lectin\u2010like properties would be a gentle solution for these problems. The synthesis of a variety of synthetic CBAs has been well documented in literature, but so far, only a couple of such (semi\u2010)synthetic compounds have been described to be endowed with antiviral (i.e. HIV) activity. Most of them belong to the pradimicin/benanomicin antibiotic family. These antifungal compounds are benzo[a]naphtacenequinones containing a d\u2010alanine and a monosaccharide and disaccharide side chains.166 Benanomicins A and B were discovered in a fermentation of Actinomadura sp., while pradimicins A\u2013E were produced from Actinomadura hibisca. Overall, the pradimicins are nearly identical to the benanomicins (Fig. 2), and their antifungal mode of action is probably based on their capacity to bind mannan in a Ca2+\u2010dependent manner. Two molecules of PRM\u2010A interact with one atom of Ca2+ creating multiple binding sites that interact with Man\u03b11\u20102Man.167 During the late 1980s, both the benanomicins A and B and pradimicin A (PRM\u2010A) were described to possess anti\u2010HIV\u2010activity.168, 169 The antiviral properties of PRM\u2010A have later been studied in more detail.170 It was shown that PRM\u2010A is able to inhibit HIV\u20101 X4 and R5 infection at nontoxic concentrations by preventing viral entry. HIV\u20101 strains selected under increasing pressure of PRM\u2010A contained up to eight different glycan deletions in the gp120 envelope, the majority being high\u2010mannose type glycans, pointing to a highly selective binding of the antibiotic to high\u2010mannose type glycans on the envelope of HIV\u20101.170 PRM\u2010A proved poorly soluble. This problem was overcome with the discovery of PRM\u2010S, which has the same cyclic backbone as PRM\u2010A, but with a negatively charged sulfated glucose instead of the terminal xylose moiety found in PRM\u2010A.171 Besides the higher solubility, PRM\u2010S has a variety of interesting features from a microbicide point of view. For instance, it not only bocks viral entry of HIV\u20101, HIV\u20102, and SIV in susceptible target cells, but also prevents DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated capture of HIV\u20101 and SIV and subsequent virus transmission to CD4+ T lymphocytes. The compound is stable at low pH (4 days at pH 4.0) and at high temperature (4 days at 50\u00b0C). Also SPR analysis revealed that it still efficiently binds gp120 at low pH.171 The stability at low pH is of particular importance for a microbicide, as the vaginal pH is acidic (3.5\u20134.5).",

Several factors affect the dynamics and evolution of CBA resistance development. More than one CBA molecule can bind at several sites on one viral envelope molecule. As high\u2010mannose type glycans are abundantly present on gp120, there are several binding options for the CBAs. It has been estimated that up to 33 PRM\u2010A molecules can bind at the same time to one single HIV\u20101 gp120 molecule.170 Although only a few peptidic CBAs (such as HHA, GNA, CV\u2010N,\u2026) can bind to gp120 due to steric hindrance between multiple CBAs, deletion of a few N\u2010glycans may create more space for other CBA molecules to bind to the remaining glycans on the mutated gp120 glycoprotein. This implies that deleting one single N\u2010linked glycan would not be sufficient for the virus to efficiently escape the antiviral action of the CBAs. In fact, it was demonstrated that multiple oligosaccharide deletions are needed on the envelope of HIV\u20101 to become phenotypically resistant to a variety of CBAs, including UDA, PRM\u2010A, and PRM\u2010S.68, 170, 192, 193, 194 The consequences of this high genetic barrier are dual: (1) patients on CBA therapy (or a therapy that includes a CBA) may develop very slow drug resistance against this CBA, and (2) the deleted glycans may create \u201choles\u201d in the protective glycan shield, thereby exposing hidden epitopes to the immune system and becoming vulnerable to a (neutralizing) antibody response (Fig. 5). Indeed, as was shown by Reitter et al.195 as little as two glycan deletions in SIV gp120 can dramatically increase the neutralizing antibody response in mutant HIV\u2010infected monkeys. Hu et al.196 proved that partly deglycosylated HIV\u20101 that was made resistant against CV\u2010N, became more sensitive to immunoglobulins directed against the V3 part of the HIV\u20101 envelope and to sera from HIV\u20101\u2010infected individuals. In this sense, CBAs may represent a completely new mode of antiviral therapy that actively involves the immune system to attack the virus and virus\u2010infected cells. This dual principle has not been described for any other antiviral compound so far. In addition, CBA\u2010binding to the viral envelope might opsonize gp120, which can result in complement activation and a cellular immune response targeting the gp120\u2010bound CBA. In this regard, the CBAs can act complementary to MBL.",

Incorrectly folded envelope proteins are expected to have a compromised (co)receptor binding and fusion. In addition, it appears that some oligosaccharides may be indispensable for HIV\u20101 replication and/or infectivity. In more than 50 HIV\u20101 strains selected under increasing CBA pressure, 8 N\u2010linked glycans were never found deleted (Fig. 4). Among them, 4 are complex type glycans that are part of the variable V1/V2\u2010loop. It was shown that deletion of these V1/V2\u2010loop glycans on gp120 resulted in severe impairment of the replication capacity and even an increased susceptibility to the inhibitory effect of some CBAs.198, 199 Futhermore, deletion of the high\u2010mannose type glycan at position N260 seems to be detrimental for the infectivity of HIV\u20101.200 It would therefore be interesting to develop antibodies against such N\u2010linked glycan sites. The neutralizing antibody 2G12 that specifically recognizes N\u2010glycan epitopes on HIV\u20101 gp120 and some recently developed antibodies against a trimannose structure that are able to recognize the HIV\u20101 and SIV envelope201 suggests that this would be a feasible goal.",

For instance, the entry of HCV pseudoparticles into Huh7 cells and their capture by DC\u2010SIGN\u2010expressing cells was efficiently blocked by the plant CBAs GNA, HHA, CA, and UDA and the non\u2010peptidic PRM\u2010A.4 These CBAs are also active against infection of certain viruses of the Nidovirales family, like coronaviruses,4, 7, 202 arteriviruses, and toroviruses,8 and against CMV,66 the feline immunodeficiency virus203 and DENV6 infection and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission of HTLV\u20101.204 CV\u2010N has also been found inhibitory to Ebola virus and influenza virus.44, 205 Conflicting reports, however, exist on the potential of CBAs to inhibit HSV entry. Bertaux et al.4 did not observe any antiviral activity of HHA, GNA, UDA, or PRM\u2010A against HSV\u20101, while Tiwari et al.46 showed that HSV\u20101 entry could be blocked with CV\u2010N. As CV\u2010N and PRM\u2010A both preferentially bind external \u03b11\u20102 mannose residues, it is rather surprising that their antiviral spectrum would be different. However, the oligosaccharides present on a virus partly depend on the cell line that has produced the virus. In the case of FIV, it was shown that FIV derived from the fibroblast cell line CRFK was remarkably more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of plant CBAs than FIV derived from thymocyte cell cultures.203 Also, gp120 produced by insect cells tends to bind CBAs better than when produced by mammalian CHO cells, presumably by the higher density and/or amounts of high\u2010mannose type oligosaccharides on insect glycoproteins.206 It is therefore important to investigate viruses derived from their naturally infected cell types in order to examine their interaction with CBAs. Thus, the list of enveloped glycosylated viruses that can be inhibited by the CBAs is certainly not limited to HIV and probably other viruses with sensitivity about CBAs will be discovered. In this context, CBAs may also be effective against other pathogens different from viruses. DC\u2010SIGN acts as a universal pathogen receptor, capable of binding microorganisms like M. tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Schistosoma mansoni.207, 208, 209 Whether the CBAs are also able to block the interaction between these pathogens and DC\u2010SIGN still needs to be investigated, but it is likely that CBAs, by interacting with the glycans on the pathogens, can prevent the binding to DC\u2010SIGN, thereby compromising their DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated transmission.",

As HIV\u20101 derives its membrane from the host cells, these factors can also be present on the viral membrane and protect HIV\u20101 from complement lysis. Moreover, opsonization of pathogens with complement factors like C3b, iC3b, and C3d normally induces clearance and elimination of the antigens by binding to CR\u2010expressing cells.223 However, HIV\u20101 takes advantage of the opsonization and binding to CRs to infect permissive cells like monocytes, CD4+ T cells, and DCs. Thus, although the innate immune system represents a very efficient first\u2010line defense against invading pathogens, in the case of HIV\u20101, it has serious shortcomings, failing to efficiently contain the infection.
