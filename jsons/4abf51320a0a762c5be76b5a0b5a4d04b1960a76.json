This study is concerned about the dynamic of COVID 19 pandemic among indigenous populations living in the remote Amazon rainforest enclaves. Using the Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model, the spread of the COVID 19 under 3 intervention scenarios (low, moderate, high) is simulated and predicted in indigenous tribe populations. The SIR model forecasts that without intervention, the epidemic peak may reach within 10-20 days. Nonetheless the peak can be reduced with strict interventions. Under low intervention, the COVID 19 cases are reduced to 73% and 56% of the total populations. While, in the scenario of high intervention, the COVID 19 peaks can be reduced to values ranging from 53% to 15% .To conclude, the simulated interventions tested by SIR model have reduced the pandemic peak and flattened the COVID 19 curve in indigenous populations. Nonetheless, it is mandatory to strengthen all mitigation efforts, reduce exposures, and decrease transmission rate as possible for COVID 19 containment.",

The model helps us to understand kinetics of pandemic with any specific aspects and the SIR model is also simple to understand and has clear interpretations (Wagh et al. 2020) . In the standard SIR model (Waqas et al. 2020) , the total population (N) is divided into three compartments. The Susceptible (S), the fraction of the total population that is vulnerable and at a risk of being infected. The Infected (I), the population who has been infected. The Recovered (R), the fraction of the total population that recovers. In the SIR model, there are several input parameters need to be considered. Those parameters denote as \u00df and \u03b3.",

For the small tribe population as observed in Lagartococha, the COVID 19 is estimated will reach it peaks in less than 10 days. After that the infection rates will decrease and and the recovery rates will increase however at slow rates. The similar patters are also observed in the larger population as can be observed in the SIR model available for Yasuni population. This tribe population is estimated will also experience high increase of COVID 19 cases between 10 and 20 days which is more longer than what happens to small tribe population in this case the Lagartococha. Based on the SIR model, it is estimated that during its peaks, the highest cases for the Lagartococha population are between 86% to 93% of the total population equal to 744 people.

As the model notices, an increase in the interventions is associated with a decrease in the infected cases and a flattening in the COVID 19 curve. Besides, the model shows a decrease in the proportion of total population infected by the COVID 19 and the disease lasts for a shorter period. For the Lagartococha populations, the effect is clear for 50% and 75% interventions. The peak of infected case is reduced from 86% to 73% under 50% interventions.

This condition related to the genetic drift events promoted by founder effects and anthropogenic factors includes tribe's warlike customs. The same condition is also observed in the Callar\u00fa population. There was a decrease of the internal intervillage genetic heterogeneity in the Callar\u00fa as reported by Neel et al. 1980 . This condition was caused by the migrations from the interior forest enclaves to the river bank and individual mobility (Salzano et al. 1980) . Under the COVID 19 pandemic threats, a population with the low genetic diversity may be more susceptible. Mulligan et al. (2004) found that low gene pools in native American tribes were determinant factors for common complex diseases, diabetes, and rare Mendelian disorders as well.

In here, the model has been presented by using several SIR input parameters. The model shows an intact exponential increase in the total number of infected cases. The COVID 19 cases will peak within 10 days for Lagartococha and 20 days for Yasuni populations. This gives a first idea of how the epidemic is spreading rapidly across the indigenous populations. By applying intervention scenarios from the lowest to the highest intervention levels to the SIR model, the epidemic peak can be reduced and hence curve flattens. This will indeed flatten the curve but will prolong the duration of the epidemic. With the simulated interventions, the COVID 19 peak can be reduced to more than half of the numbers of cases without interventions. These findings underline the importance of appropriate interventions for limiting and even stoppig the spread of the COVID 19 especially among the vulnerable and isolated indigenous populations.",

The individual health status is not only the determinant factors that can make the tribe indigenous populations become susceptible to the pandemic or can cause a burden to the prevention and mitigation efforts. There are several external factors that can contribute more to the spread of the diseases. Those factors include the availability of remote health centers and the rapid encroachment development. According to the INEI Indigenous Census in 2017, only 5% of indigenous populations in the entire Amazon have access to health facilities without hospitalization. Likewise only 1.7% have inpatient health centers. In regards to the rapid developments, according to Finer et al. 2009, currently there are several roads that can access the Yasuni remote populations. This road can increase the contacts with the individuals outside the intact indigenous populations and make this populations more prone to the disease.",
