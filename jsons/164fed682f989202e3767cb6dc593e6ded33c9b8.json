TNF-\u2423 (500 U/ml) induced apoptosis of OLN cells, which was confirmed by DNA fragmentation using an in situ end-labeling technique and ultrastructural analysis. Flupirtine significantly reduced the rate of spontaneous cell death of OLN cells already at low concentrations; TNF-\u2423-mediated apoptosis was suppressed only with higher concentrations of flupirtine (100 M). Expression of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA in OLN cells was detected by immunocytochemistry, western blot, and RT-PCR. Quantitative analysis of western blots revealed an \u03f32.5-fold upregulation of Bcl-2 protein during TNF-\u2423 treatment. Furthermore, addition of 10 or 100 M flupirtine before incubation with TNF-\u2423 led to an approximately threefold increase of Bcl-2 expression. Exposure of OLN cells to flupirtine alone moderately augmented the expression of Bcl-2 protein. Our data demonstrate that flupirtine upregulates the expression of Bcl-2 protein in OLN cells; this Bcl-2 induction is associated with a reduced rate of TNF-\u2423-induced cell death.",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS leading to selective destruction of myelin sheaths and/or oligodendrocytes (Lassmann, 1983) . The mechanisms behind demyelination or remyelination, however, are poorly understood, although a heterogeneous pathogenesis is suggested owing to detailed investigations of oligodendrocyte pathology in demyelinating lesions (Lucchinetti et al., 1996 . In particular, it is not yet clear whether oligodendrocytes are primarily affected in the disease or whether they are destroyed together with myelin during active demyelination (Itoyama et al., 1980; Br\u00fcck et al., 1994; Ozawa et al., 1994; Raine, 1994) . Oligodendrocyte death is a prominent feature in MS lesions. It is, however, not yet clear whether oligodendrocytes die via apoptosis or necrosis, which are different mechanisms of cell death (Selmaj et al., 1991; Lucchinetti et al., 1996) . Dowling et al. (1997) observed that 14 -40% of all degenerating cells in MS lesions are of oligodendroglial lineage and that most of these cells were dying by apoptosis. Exposure to heat-treated cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients caused apoptotic death of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Menard et al., 1998) . On the other hand, Bonetti and Raine (1997) found that oligodendrocytes express cell death-related molecules such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors but show no evidence of apoptosis. TNF is a key protein in inducing oligodendrocyte death. It mediates apoptosis of oligodendrocytes in vitro (Selmaj and Raine, 1988) , and its overexpression in the CNS leads to demyelination and oligodendrocyte death (Akassoglou et al., 1998) . A recent study revealed a strong association of TNF-\u2423 mRNA expression and active demyelination in MS lesions (Bitsch et al., 2000) .",

Apoptotic cell death is accompanied by nuclear changes that include oligonucleosomal DNA fragmenta-tion and chromatin condensation into a dense crescentshaped aggregate that marginates along the nuclear envelope and leads to cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing (Lo et al., 1995) . Several proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Bcl-2 is suggested to play an important role in protecting cells from PCD. It was first described in a B cell lymphoma in which it is overexpressed; it is located in the endoplasmatic reticulum and in the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Tsujimoto and Croce, 1986; Hawkins and Vaux, 1994; Reed, 1994) . Bcl-2 seems to be involved in the apoptotic pathway by inhibiting damage of lipid membranes and cell organelles through oxygen radicals or by affecting the cell cycle (Hockenbery et al., 1990) ; it was shown to be expressed by oligodendrocytes in chronic active and silent MS lesions (Bonetti and Raine, 1997) and to correlate positively with the survival of oligodendrocytes after a demyelinating attack (Kuhlmann et al., 1999) .",

Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival (Hockenbery et al., 1990; Vaux, 1998) . The antiapoptotic activity is achieved by suppressing the apoptosis-inducing function of Bax by forming heterodimers with the Bax protein (Oltvai et al., 1993) .

            "text": "There is still considerable controversy on the role of apoptosis in the elimination of oligodendrocytes from demyelinating CNS lesions. Local TNF/p55TNF recep-tor signaling is capable of inducing oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination in transgenic mice (Akassoglou et al., 1998) . After intracerebral infection of Lewis rats with JHM coronavirus, a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease is induced, which in many aspects mimics the pathology of MS. At later stages after infection, the virus antigen was nearly completely cleared from the lesions, and oligodendrocytes were mainly destroyed by apoptosis (Barac-Latas et al., 1997) . Similar observations were made in canine distemper virus demyelinating encephalitis (Schobesberger et al., 1999) as well as in an experimental model of myelin-associated glycoprotein deficiency . In and around MS lesions, molecules belonging to the apoptotic cascade have been shown to be expressed by oligodendrocytes (Bonetti and Raine, 1997) . Whether the expression of these molecules is associated with the presence of oligodendrocyte apoptosis, however, is still controversial (Lucchinetti et al., 1996; Bonetti and Raine, 1997; Dowling et al., 1997 Dowling et al., , 1999 . The fact that oligodendrocytes can be driven into apoptosis in vitro, in contrast, is undoubted, and TNF-\u2423 seems to play a critical role in this process (Selmaj and Raine, 1988; Selmaj et al., 1991) . The protooncogene p53 induces oligodendrocyte death after induction by TNF-\u2423 (Eizenberg et al., 1996; Ladiwala et al., 1999) , and TNF-\u2423 potentiates interferon-\u2425-induced cell death in oligodendrocyte progenitors (Andrews et al., 1998) . The final execution phase of TNF-\u2423-induced oligodendrocyte death seems to be mediated by the ICE/CED-3 family of caspases (Hisahara et al., 1997; Gu et al., 1999) . In our study, flupirtine up-regulated Bcl-2 when given in high concentrations (100 M). The greatest increase in Bcl-2 protein was observed when TNF-\u2423 was applied in combination with 10 or 100 M flupirtine. Flupirtine treatment protected oligodendrocytes from TNF-\u2423-mediated apoptosis. However, only the 100 M concentration of flupirtine produced a highly significant reduction of oligodendrocyte apoptosis. This may be due to the fact that flupirtine does not selectively affect Bcl-2 protein expression, but also modifies other proteins of the apoptosis cascade. Besides up-regulation of Bcl-2, flupirtine is known to decrease levels of ICH-1, which is caspase 2 (Osborne et al., 1997) . It is interesting that caspase 2 and 3 expression was demonstrated in oligodendrocytes undergoing apoptosis (Gu et al., 1999) . A recent study identified the inhibition of caspase 3 and up-regulation of Bcl-2 as mechanisms to rescue oligodendrocytes from TNF-\u2423-mediated apoptosis (Soane et al., 1999) . Thus, flupirtine may act at different levels of the apoptotic cascade and interfere with the balance of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signals.",

Flu-pirtine increases the expression of Bcl-2 and protects neurons from \u2424-amyloid-induced apoptosis or prion fragment-mediated neurotoxicity Perovic et al., 1997) . In the present study, flupirtine alone or in addition to TNF-\u2423 up-regulated Bcl-2 protein and rescued oligodendrocytes from TNF-\u2423-induced cell death. The induction of Bcl-2 expression may therefore be an interesting therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases to support oligodendrocyte survival. The question whether Bcl-2 plays a role in the survival of oligodendrocytes in MS lesions was recently studied (Kuhlmann et al., 1999) . As already shown by others (Bonetti and Raine, 1997) , Bcl-2 is present in MS plaques; our study, however, found a clear association among Bcl-2 expression, oligodendrocyte survival, and remyelination in MS plaques (Kuhlmann et al., 1999) . Bcl-2-associated mechanisms may belong to a group of different effectors that support survival of oligodendrocytes and include the activation of tyrosine kinase or cytokine receptors (Casaccia-Bonnefil, 2000) . New therapeutic strategies may develop from these experiments, preventing loss of oligodendrocytes from demyelinating lesions and supporting myelin regeneration.",
