Irrigation method is an important factor as choosing an optimal strategy can minimize the contact of irrigation water with the above\u2010ground portion of the crop and, hence, lower the risk of viral contamination. In a field study by Stine and others (2005b) no viral contamination of lettuce was detected when grown using subsurface drip irrigation practices, while the use of furrow irrigation led to contaminated lettuce. Crops irrigated with sprinkler and furrow systems may have a higher chance of direct contact with viruses and are, hence, considered to be more hazardous for fresh produce crops such as lettuce (Wei and Kniel 2010). Concerning the influence of produce type, leafy vegetables such as lettuce, with high water retention capacity and in close contact with the ground, are identified to be especially vulnerable to viral contamination through irrigation (Hamilton and others 2006).",

In general, mean inactivation rates of viruses in fresh water are less than 1 log10 per day, indicating that viruses can persist in freshwater sources for prolonged periods (Rzezutka and Cook 2004). Persistence of surrogate virus MNV\u20101 has also been observed in reconstituted pesticides (Verhaelen and others 2013b). With time, the ratio of infectious particles to genomic copies (molecular detection) has been observed to decrease and, as such, this ratio is partly depending on the \u201cage\u201d of contamination (De Roda Husman and others 2009). The persistence of enteric viruses in water is known to be affected by temperature, virus association with solids, exposure to light (UV), and the presence of indigenous microbiota. These are all factors that are known to be substantially different from one geographical location to another (John and Rose 2005; Bosch and others 2006).",

However, enteric viruses can persist for several days on fresh produce during preharvest conditions. As such, a D\u2010value of 4.8 d was observed for MNV\u20101 on semisavoy spinach during a persistence study in greenhouse biocontrol chambers (Hirneisen and Kniel 2013c). While an inactivation rate (kd) as low as 0.01, 0.12, and 0.11 per day (corresponding to a D\u2010value of 100, 8, and 9 d) was observed for HAV on cantaloupe, lettuce, and bell peppers, respectively, during a persistence study in a controlled environment chamber mimicking relevant growing condition in the United States and Central America (Stine and others 2005a). All in all, these limited studies suggest that enteric viruses persist longer than enteric bacteria and may persist from the time of contamination (such as by means of irrigation) to harvesting (Stine and others 2005a). Persistence can depend on crop type and even crop variety (e.g., survival of MNV\u20101 and TV on semisavoy spinach versus smooth spinach mentioned by Stine and others 2005a; Carratala and others 2013; Hirneisen and Kniel 2013c). Since the surface texture and structure of vegetables may play an important role in the attachment and persistence of viruses. As such, the rougher or more irregular the surface of produce, the longer viruses are able to persist (Stine and others 2005a; Hirneisen and Kniel 2013c).",

An important implication of the biphasic inactivation is the possibility for virus accumulation on the crop surface over subsequent irrigations due to the presence of a persistent subpopulation of viruses that decay slowly (Petterson and others 2001). This higher persistence of this subpopulation could be a result of their location in a more protective niche such as stomata, complex wax structures, or cuts. Also, the location of inoculum on the abaxial (lower) leaf surfaces has been observed to result in higher decimal reduction times (D\u2010values) compared to viruses present on adaxial (upper) leaf surfaces (Hirneisen and Kniel 2013c).",

This illustrates the potential risk when infected food handlers are employed in a food processing/handling environment. Once surfaces are contaminated, these surfaces can function as reservoir for further contamination events, and this for prolonged periods of time, as the relative persistence of enteric viruses in the environment is high. As such, the half\u2010life of HAV on stainless steel under different conditions (T \u226420 \u00b0C and RH <80%) was at least 4 d (Sattar and others 2000). Surrogate MNV\u20101 has been observed to remain infectious after 28 d on several surfaces (stainless steel, ceramic, rubber, wood, glass, plastic) at room temperature (Kim and others 2014). Exceptionally, it has been found that copper could effectively inactivate MNV\u20101 by destroying the viral capsid massively (Warnes and others 2015). On inanimate surfaces, the most important factors that affect virus stability are the type of virus and surface, relative humidity, moisture content, temperature, composition of the suspending medium, light exposure, and presence of antiviral chemicals or biological agents (Bosch and others 2006). Next to these influencing factors, the presence of food residue has been observed to increase the persistence and the resistance of enteric viruses towards chemicals (Takahashi and others 2011).",

As such, in a recent outbreak in Korea the use of contaminated ground water during the processing of cabbage kimchi was identified as the source of viral contamination (Cho and others 2014). Viral transfer from contaminated fresh produce to washing water (without sanitizers) has been documented for both lab\u2010scale and industrial\u2010scale washing units (Baert and others 2009; Casteel and others 2009; Holvoet and others 2014).

However, while gloves may provide an important barrier against food contamination, it has to be noted that they cannot be used as a stand\u2010alone hygienic measure. The combination of hand washing with an extra intervention measure\u2014hand gloving and hand gloving/disinfectant\u2014is advised to prevent virus spread during food preparation (Stals and others 2015). In addition, infected food handlers can also indirectly contaminate the food by contaminating the environment. Besides, cross\u2010contamination with naturally contaminated fresh produce or other food commodities such as seafood is also a risk factor. For example, the cross\u2010contamination of salad by seafood was identified as the probable cause of an outbreak of NoV illness in 1979 (Griffin and others 1982).",

            "text": "Low\u2010temperature storage immediately upon harvest is recommended to preserve the quality of fresh produce, primarily by lowering the respiration and metabolism rates. Ideal storage temperatures for berries and leafy greens are 3 to 5 \u00b0C and 0 to 5 \u00b0C, respectively (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel 2014a,b). Temperature has been identified as the major factor influencing virus persistence. However, in contrast to bacterial pathogens, maintaining the cold\u2010chain cannot be considered as a mitigation strategy for viral pathogens on fresh produce, as persistence of enteric viruses is higher at low temperatures, and decay rates generally increase with increasing temperatures (RIVM 2013). In Table 2, log10 reduction data are presented for the persistence of enteric viruses or their surrogates on soft red fruits and leafy greens. Next to temperature, persistence has been found to depend on other factors: type of fresh produce (Croci and others 2002; Verhaelen and others 2012), different environmental factors, such as relative humidity (RH), presence of feces, and aggregation (Konowalchuk and Speirs 1975), and the virus type (Rzezutka and Cook 2004). The presence of fecal material strongly enhances virus persistence (Escudero and others 2012). The effect of RH is less unambiguous given that MNV and MS2 persisted better at low RH, while HAV persisted better at higher RH in a study by Kim and others (2012). In a recent study it was suggested that absolute humidity (AH, a measure of the actual amount of water vapor in a particular sample of air) rather than RH (the ratio of the actual amount of water vapor present in a sample to that amount that would be needed to saturate that particular sample) is the critical factor for keeping NoV infectious. The data also suggested that when the atmosphere was not entirely saturated (as 100% RH), low AH values (below 0.007 kg water/kg air) are favorable to NoV persistence. This possibly explains the seasonality of NoV infections since low winter AH conditions (96.3% of the day with AH <0.007 kg water/kg air) in a temperate climates as in Paris, France provides favorable conditions for keeping human NoV infectious (de la Noue and others 2014).",

This reasoning also applies to bacteria. Hence, despite the general idea that sanitizers are used to reduce the microbial population on the produce, their main effect is maintaining the microbial quality of the water (Gil and others 2009).

Despite the occurrence of the formation of THMs in the process wash water, no residue can be found in vegetable tissue after rinsing with tap water (Lopez\u2010Galvez and others 2010; Gomez\u2010Lopez and others 2013).

Even the introduction of multiple washing steps performed in series (Baert and others 2008b), extended contact times (Xie and others 2008), or the use of increasing concentration of disinfectants (Butot and others 2008), will not necessarily lead to significantly higher reductions of the viral load of fresh produce. Similar to bacteria, viruses can be located in protective sites on the produce, such as the stomata or the cut edges, not accessible during washing procedures and most decontamination processes. As such, the use of sanitizers during the wash process is primarily to maintain the microbial quality of the wash water and hence to limit the possibility of cross\u2010contamination. Nonetheless, reporting of the effectiveness of the sanitizer under study in reducing the viral load in the resulting wash water is not always included. However, the latter is important to judge the utility for any sanitizers as mitigation strategy for cross\u2010contamination. Good practices are also required to limit internalization of pathogens by avoiding influx of potentially contaminated wash water into the produce. Therefore, a higher temperature of the washing solution than the temperature of the produce is demanded, as if the reverse is true, air bubbles inside the fresh produce will shrink upon contact with the cold water, resulting in a partial vacuum causing wash water to enter the tissue through pores, channels, or punctures (Holvoet 2014).",

The most widespread used form of nonionizing radiation for decontamination is the UV light (100 to 400 nm). UV disinfection primarily occurs due to the germicidal action of UV\u2010B (280 to 315 nm) and UV\u2010C light (200 to 280 nm) on microorganisms (US EPA 2006). Most studies use low\u2010pressure (LP) mercury lamps with a major wavelength output (85%) at 253.7 nm (monochromatic UV radiation) (Hijnen and others 2006; Eischeid and others 2011). Inactivation by this ultraviolet range is based on the damage caused to the nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) of the cell or virus, for which the UV absorbance peaks near 260 nm. Among food\u2010 and waterborne pathogens, viruses are generally more resistant than protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia, and the bacterial pathogens (Hijnen and others 2006). Adenoviruses are the most UV\u2010resistant class of viruses presently known and are, therefore, used as a standard for viral inactivation requirements in, for example, water disinfection (Eischeid and others 2011). Concerning fresh produce, UV light (dose: 40 to 120 mW s/cm\u00b2) was shown to be effective in the reduction of HAV and FCV on lettuce and green onions, resulting in reduction of 4 to 5 log10 for HAV and 2.5 to 4 log10 for FCV. However, on strawberries significantly lower reductions were observed for both viruses (<2 log10). In a study by Hirneisen and Kniel (2013b), however, MNV\u20101 proved to be more resistant to UV light, as a dose of 240 mW s/cm\u00b2 resulted in a mere reduction of about 1.2 log10 on green onions. As such, the food matrix and surface typography play an obvious role (Fino and Kniel 2008). Also, a wide variation in viral sensitivity to UV has been recognized (Eischeid and others 2011), making it impossible to estimate the possible influence on human NoV.",

As such, for vegetables and for fruits, overall average radiation doses (kGy) of up to 1 and up to 2 kGy, respectively, were evaluated as acceptable. However, as regulated in the EU by Framework Directive 1999/2/EC and Implementing Directive 1999/3/EC, so far only \u201cdried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasoning\u201d at the maximum overall absorbed radiation dose of 10 kGy are allowed (EFSA 2011). Currently, the U.S. FDA approves doses up to 4 kGy to control foodborne pathogens in fresh iceberg lettuce and spinach (FDA 2015) as a response to 3 multistate outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 traced to spinach and lettuce (CDC 2008). However, this irradiation dose proved impractical for the inactivation of viruses on fresh produce as only <2 log10 virus reduction of MNV\u20101 (4 kGy, \u03b3\u2010rays) was achieved on spinach, romaine lettuce, and strawberries in a study by Feng and others (2011), and a mere reduction of \u22640.70 log10 of MNV\u20101 was achieved on cabbage and strawberries in a study of Sanglay and others (2011) (4 kGy, e\u2010beam). Hesitant consumer acceptance toward irradiated food, the doses required for a meaningful reduction of viruses typically exceed legally approved doses, and what most produce will tolerate in terms of changes in appearance, flavor, color, and texture (Fan and others 2008) are still drawbacks that must be addressed.",

Although the resulting characteristics of the treated products are superior compared to heat\u2010treated products, still HPP has been shown to affect sensory qualities such as color, texture, shape, and rheological properties. However, these variable effects on the sensor quality of fresh produce are depending on the pressure level and type of product (Kovac and others 2010; Lou and others 2011). As such, HPP has been recommended for the processing of fruits intended for frozen storage, since freezing causes similar and more severe texture damage (Lou and others 2011; Li and others 2013b). Fresh produce\u2010related products such as purees, sauces, and juices are also fit for usage of HPP, as compared to intact fresh produce as they lack the presence of intercellular air spaces that can be severely compressed during pressure treatment, inducing physical damage to the tissue (Li and others 2013b).",

Some parameters, such as temperature and pH (Kingsley and Chen 2009; Lou and others 2011; Li and others 2013b), were shown to influence the HPP inactivation of different types of viruses, in a contradictory way. For example, colder initial temperatures of the product enhanced the inactivation of human NoV (GI.1) (Leon and others 2011) and surrogates MNV\u20101, TV, and FCV (Chen and others 2005; Li and others 2013b). In contrast, HAV, a picornavirus, is more resistant to HPP at a lower temperature than at room temperature (Kingsley and Chen 2009). The same for the parameter pH, where human NoV (surrogates) tend to be more sensitive to HPP at neutral pH than at acidic pH (Lou and others 2011; Li and others 2013a). Whereas for HAV the opposite is true (Kingsley and Chen 2009).

As such, it is conceivable that different human NoV genogroups, and perhaps different clusters within a human NoV genogroup, would exhibit varied sensitivities to HPP (Leon and others 2011). During testing, human NoV surrogates FCV and TV proved to be more susceptible to HPP compared to MNV\u20101 (Horm and others 2012a; Li and others 2013b). In the study by Lou and others (2011) on the application of HPP in the fresh produce industry, the optimal condition for MNV\u20101 inactivation by HPP in diverse fresh produce matrices was determined to be refrigeration temperature with a treatment pressure of 450 MPa and a holding time of 2 min. Using these conditions viral reductions between 4.7 and 7.0 log10 were obtained without significantly altering the physical quality of the food samples (Lou and others 2011). However, when the inactivation kinetics of MNV\u20101 (cell\u2010culture) are compared to human NoV GI.1 (obtained during a human feeding study using infected high\u2010pressure processed oysters), human NoV might be more resistant to HPP than MNV\u20101. As in the human feeding study by Leon and others (2011) treatment of oyster (seeded by injection) by HPP at 400 MPa, for 5 min at 6 \u00b0C was insufficient to prevent NoV infection in human volunteers, suggesting that 4 log10 genome equivalent reduction was not achieved. While a 5 min, 400 MPa treatment at 5 \u00b0C was sufficient to inactivate 4.1 log10 PFU MNV\u20101 in oyster tissue (Kingsley and others 2007). In the human volunteer study a 600 MPa treatment for 5 min at 6 \u00b0C was successful to inactivate human NoV GI.1 within raw oysters (Leon and others 2011). This higher resistance of human NoV to HPP was also observed when binding assays, using porcine gastric mucin\u2010conjugated magnetic beads followed by RT\u2010qPCR assays, were used for discriminating potentially infectious human NoVs GI.1 (Dancho and others 2012) and GII.4 (Li and others 2013a) following HPP.",

In light of the main identified food commodities of concern, namely soft red fruits and leafy greens, this section will be restricted to the effect of classic heat treatment (pasteurization) and blanching, since heating of frozen berries has been regularly communicated as a mitigation strategy for foodborne outbreaks due to viral\u2010contaminated berries (Guzman\u2010Herrador and others 2014). The possible effectiveness of this measure was illustrated during the German outbreak in 2012 due to contaminated frozen strawberries. During the outbreak investigation it was noted that not all kitchens which used the implicated batch of frozen strawberries were linked to disease cases. This was a result of the different ways of preparing the strawberry compote among kitchens. As such, it was observed that those places receiving meals from kitchens where the strawberry compote was stewed (thoroughly cooked) were not affected by outbreaks. The schools and childcare facilities that received the compote from kitchens that did not sufficiently heat the compote were indeed obviously associated with disease cases (Task Force gastroenteritis 2012).",

Hence, validation of a specific heat treatment in the relevant food matrix is well\u2010considered. However, in the literature only a limited number of heat inactivation studies are available for produce matrices. Relevant matrices used for traditional heat inactivation experiments of enteric viruses/surrogates are restricted to purees of soft red fruits (raspberry, strawberry, bilberry) (Deboosere and others 2004, 2010; Baert and others 2008a) and spinach (Bozkurt and others 2014a).",

The inadequacy of mild heat treatment steps at low temperatures can also be confirmed by a human challenge study in which human NoV was found to remain infectious for volunteers after 30 min at 60 \u00b0C (Dolin and others 1972). Next to the virus type, matrix factors such as pH and sugar content have been confirmed to have a significant effect on heat inactivation of enteric viruses and surrogates. As such, studies are available that observed a rise in inactivation time of HAV (in strawberry mashes) and MNV\u20101 (in PBS), with increasing sucrose concentration and observed a moderate rise in inactivation time of HAV (in strawberry mashes) with increasing pH. Attempts have been made to model the heat inactivation of HAV in berry mashes as a function of temperature and product characteristics, such as pH and sugar concentration (Deboosere and others 2004; Deboosere and others 2010). However, validation of the model by Deboosere and others (2004) in fruit\u2010based products failed. Weaknesses of the latter model of Deboosere and others (2010) are the limited temperature range (65 to 75 \u00b0C) and the inclusion of the come\u2010up time (about 2 min) in the treatment time. This practice assumes that the temperature during this come\u2010up time was constant and at the target temperature, and possibly explains the occurrence of a shoulder in the inactivation curves and the very low log reduction estimates when the model was used to calculate the effect of short heat treatments (0.02 and 0.16 log10 reduction at 30 s and 1 min at 75 \u00b0C and pH 2.5, respectively). In contrast, in\u2010house data on MNV\u20101 heat inactivation in raspberry puree (75 \u00b0C, 30 s) suggest a reduction of \u22654.29 log10 (unpublished data). As such, there is a need for additional studies that take into account heat\u2010inactivation kinetics during the phase of temperature increase to reach the target temperature (Deboosere and others 2010) or models that do not include the preheating step at all. As in validation of time/temperature treatments in food processing, generally preheating and longer exposure to these temperatures during cooling down are not included to assume a worst case scenario in which the reduction solely originates from the actual heat treatment (Baert and others 2008a).",

As such, a reduction of \u22652.44 log MNV\u20101 (detection limit of assay was reached) was observed when fresh spinach was treated for 1 min in a hot water bath of either 80 \u00b0C or 90 \u00b0C (Baert and others 2008b). Confirmation of the effectiveness of (steam) blanching was provided in a study on fresh herbs such as parsley, basil, mint, and chives. Generally >3 log10 reductions were observed for HAV and FCV on fresh herbs when blanched at 95 \u00b0C for 2.5 min. When blanching was performed at 75 \u00b0C for 2.5 min, more variation in heat resistance of enteric viruses was observed, varying depending on the herb (e.g., HAV reduction on mint and chives was 1.7 and >3.0 log10, respectively) (Butot and others 2009).",

However, cooking procedures in which an internal temperature of the food reaches at least 90 \u00b0C for 90 s are considered adequate treatments to destroy viral infectivity in most foods (FAO/WHO 2012). Following the recommendation for heat treatment of shellfish (90 \u00b0C for 90 s), HAV was successfully inactivated in shellfish (Hewitt and Greening 2006). Several other thermal studies suggest that high\u2010temperature, short\u2010time treatments (90 \u00b0C, 30 s) should suffice for inactivation (>4 log10 reduction) of human NoV (surrogates) (Bozkurt and others 2014b; in\u2010house data on MNV\u20101 reduction in raspberry puree: \u22654 log10 for 95 \u00b0C, 30 s). Nevertheless, data concerning heat treatments of produce at temperatures >75 \u00b0C are scarce and only available for a limited number of surrogates (Deboosere and others 2004 for HAV). Hence additional relevant heat inactivation studies for this high\u2010temperature range in relevant produce matrices and for several (surrogate) viruses should be conducted to obtain more insight.",

In addition, contaminated irrigation water and process water have been shown to be relevant viral contamination routes of fresh produce.
