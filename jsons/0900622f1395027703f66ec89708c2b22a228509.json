            "text": "The reason why RNA viruses, and positive-strand RNA viruses in particular, interact with the nucleolus when the site of genome replication is in the cytoplasm is less intuitive. In this latter case, viral proteins that are normally required in the cytoplasm must transit through the nuclear pore complex both to and from the nucleus. This process is crucial for virus biology because if the viral proteins that are required for cytoplasmic functions such as RNA synthesis and encapsidation are sequestered in the nucleolus or nucleus, then progeny virus production will be affected as has been revealed by inhibitor and genetic studies (Lee et al. 2006; Tijms et al. 2002) . Viruses may interact with the nucleolus to usurp host cell functions and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. Investigating the interactions between viruses and the nucleolus may facilitate the design of novel anti-viral therapies both in terms of recombinant vaccines (Pei et al. 2008 ) and molecular intervention (Rossi et al. 2007) , and also contribute to a more detailed understanding of the cell biology of the nucleolus.",

One of the best-studied viruses in terms of viral interactions with the nucleolus is HIV-1 and is described in detail in Chap. 17. Although HIV has clearly defined cytoplasmic and nuclear replication strategies, the virus has a positive-sense RNA genome in the sense that the viral capsid contains two copies of positive-sense RNA, but these are reverse transcribed in the cytoplasm and then trafficked to the nucleus, where ultimately the new genome is transcribed and trafficked back to the cytoplasm. Part of the reasoning for the interaction of HIV-1 with the nucleolus is the trafficking of intronless mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (Michienzi et al. 2000) . This is a property shared with herpes viruses and indicated that different viruses have evolved similar strategies involving subversion of nucleolar function for the benefit of virus biology (Boyne and Whitehouse 2006) . In the case of HIV-1, this knowledge has also led to the design and implementation of effective genetic therapies against the virus (Unwalla et al. 2008 ).",

A genome-wide screen of three distinct herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), has shown that at least 12 herpesvirus-encoded proteins specifically localise to the nucleolus (Salsman et al. 2008) , which are implicated in many aspects of the herpesvirus life cycle. Therefore, a number of proteomic studies are currently being undertaken to study changes, in a global context, within the nucleolar proteome during virus infections, and are discussed later (Lam et al. 2010) . Several different herpes virus proteins have been shown to cause the redistribution of nucleolar proteins and hence disruption of the nucleolus. These include herpes simplex virus 1, the major tegument structural protein VP22 (Lopez et al. 2008) , and the US11 (Xing et al. 2010) and UL24 proteins (Bertrand and Pearson 2008; Lymberopoulos and Pearson 2007) .

Similar observations have also been made in herpesviruses Whitehouse 2006, 2009; Leenadevi and Dalziel 2009) . Initial studies utilising the prototype g-2 herpesvirus, herpes virus saimiri (HVS), demonstrated that the HVS nucleolar trafficking ORF57 protein induces nucleolar redistribution of the host cell human TREX proteins, which are involved in mRNA nuclear export (Boyne and Whitehouse 2006) . Intriguingly, ablating ORF57 nucleolar trafficking led to a failure of ORF57-mediated viral mRNA nuclear export (Boyne and Whitehouse 2006) . The precise role of this nucleolar sequestration is yet to be determined, but possible effects on viral mRNA/protein processing and viral ribonucleoprotein particle assembly are currently being investigated.",

Moreover, on the rapid disorganisation of the nucleolus a reduction is observed in virus mRNA nuclear export (Boyne and Whitehouse 2009 ). The formation of an ORF57-mediated export competent ribonucleoprotein particle within the nucleolus may also have implications for the translation of viral mRNAs. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that the cellular nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttle protein, PYM, which is involved in translation enhancement, is redistributed to the nucleolus in the presence of the KSHV ORF57 protein (Boyne et al. 2010 ). This interaction effectively enhances the translation of the predominantly intronless transcripts made by KSHV, and draws parallels with potential translation enhancement of positive strand RNA virus genomes through their interaction with the nucleolus (discussed later).",

Similarly, in HSV-1 infected cells, a number of nucleolar proteins including nucleolin and UBF are recruited into viral DNA replication centres . These are specific sites where replication and encapsidation of the HSV-1 genome occurs. Evidence suggests that sequestration of UBF is essential for viral DNA replication as overexpression of tagged version of UBF acts in a dominant-negative manner inhibiting virus DNA replication (Stow et al. 2009 ).

            "text": "In addition to enhancing virus replication, nucleolar proteins are redistributed to alter cellular pathways during infection. For example, the nucleolar targeted HSV-1 US11 protein has been shown to interact with homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), which plays a role in p53-mediated cellular apoptosis and hypoxic response (Calzado et al. 2009 ) and also participates in the regulation of the cell cycle (Calzado et al. 2007 ). This interaction alters the sub-cellular localisation of HIPK2 and protects against HIPK2-mediated cell cycle arrest (Giraud et al. 2004) . In contrast, the cellular protein, protein interacting with the carboxyl terminus-1 (PICT-1), can sequester the virally encoded apoptosis suppressor protein, KS-Bcl-2 protein, from the mitochondria into the nucleolus to down-regulate its anti-apoptotic activity (Kalt et al. 2010 ). This is a potential interesting interplay between two sub-cellular structures involved in the viral stress response (Olson 2009 ), and maybe more common and widespread. For example, bacterial infection has been shown to disrupt the nucleolus through regulating mitochondrial dysfunction (Dean et al. 2010).",

In this case, sub-cellular localisation to the nucleolus would have no physiological consequence for the virus or the cell. However, RNA virus replication is error prone and selection pressure might apply to such a fortuitous localisation (given the ~4,500+ nucleolar proteins and their diverse roles (Ahmad et al. 2009 )), with the concomitant effect that the virus could select for changes that ultimately disrupt nucleolar function and/or recruit nucleolar proteins to aid virus replication.",

The molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown, but the displacement and re-localisation of nucleolar proteins by viral proteins could increase or decrease the nucleolar, nuclear and/or cytoplasmic pool of these proteins. Certainly, the accumulation of viral proteins in the nucleolus could potentially cause volume exclusion or crowding effects, which have been proposed to play a fundamental role in the formation of nuclear compartments including the nucleolus, and can be addressed by proteomic strategies. Therefore, disruption of nucleolar architecture and function might be common in virus-infected cells if viral proteins target the nucleolus or a stage of the virus lifecycle disrupts nucleolar proteins. For example, poliovirus infection results in the selective redistribution of nucleolin from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm (Waggoner and Sarnow 1998) and inactivation of UBF, which shuts off RNA polymerase I transcription in the host cell. The infection of cells with IBV has been shown to disrupt nucleolar architecture (Dove et al. 2006b ) and cause arrest of the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and failure of cytokinesis (Dove et al. 2006a) . The IBV and arterivirus nucleocapsid proteins associate with nucleolin and fibrillarin, respectively. Similarly, the HIV-1 Rev protein has been shown to localise to the DFC and GC and over-expression of Rev protein alters the nucleolar architecture and is associated with the accumulation of nucleophosmin (Dundr et al. 1995) .",

Nucleolar trafficking might be mediated by virtue of the fact that viral proteins that are trafficked to the nucleolus contain motifs that resemble host nucleolar targeting signals, that is, a form of molecular mimicry is used . The discovery of specific nucleolar trafficking signals in viral proteins has indicated a functional mechanism behind this observed localisation (Lee et al. 2003; Reed et al. 2006; . Analysis of the different nucleolar trafficking signals identified in viral proteins using dynamic live-cell imaging has certainly demonstrated that different proteins can confer differential trafficking rates and localisation patterns (Emmott et al. 2008) .

The arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid protein localises to the nucleolus and has been shown to contain two potential NLSs, a pat4 and a downstream pat7 motif (Rowland et al. 1999 . Analysis revealed that a 31 amino acid sequence incorporating the pat7 motif could direct the nucleocapsid protein to both the nucleus and nucleolus. The protein also contains a predicted NES, presumably to allow the protein to traffic back into the cytoplasm to contribute to viral function in this compartment. This is common with other similar related proteins. For example, in the avian coronavirus nucleocapsid protein an eight amino acid sequence is necessary and sufficient to target the protein to the nucleolus (Reed et al. 2006 ) and contains an NES (Reed et al. 2007 ). Intriguingly, genetic analysis (Lee et al. 2006) , dynamic livecell imaging (You et al. 2008 ) and use of trafficking inhibitors (Tijms et al. 2002) paint a picture of the requirement of these positive sense RNA virus capsid proteins localising to the nucleolus as soon as they are translated, prior to their involvement in virus replication or assembly. This may be related to subversion of host cell function, protein modification (e.g. phosphorylation) or recruitment of nucleolar proteins.",

For example, the hepatitis delta antigen has been shown to contain a nucleolar targeting signal that also corresponded to a site that promoted binding to nucleolin (Lee et al. 1998) . Mutating this region prevented nucleolin binding to the delta antigen and nucleolar trafficking. By implication, this relates nucleolin binding to nucleolar trafficking (Lee et al. 1998) . Certainly, interaction with nucleophosmin and hepatitis delta antigens can modulate viral replication (Huang et al. 2001 ) and more recently combined proteomic-RNAi screens have revealed many other nucleolar proteins that can be associated with this viral protein (Cao et al. 2009 ). Trafficking and accumulation of viral proteins to and from the nucleolus, similar to cellular proteins, may also be cell cycle related. For example, the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein localises preferentially to the nucleolus in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Cawood et al. 2007) , as does the human cytomegalovirus protein UL83 in the G1 phase (Arcangeletti et al. 2011) . Again these trafficking profiles may be related to the interaction with cellular nucleolar proteins (Emmott and Hiscox 2009).",

Such in vitro data has also been backed up by persuasive in vivo data. Mutation of the arterivirus nucleocapsid protein pat7 NLS motif in the context of a full-length clone revealed that this sequence could have a key role in virus pathogenesis in vivo, as animals infected with mutant viruses had shorter viraemia than wild-type viruses (Lee et al. 2006; Pei et al. 2008) . Interestingly, reversions occurred in the mutated nucleocapsid gene sequence and although the amino acid sequence of the pat7 motif was altered, its function was not; this new signal was defined as a pat8 motif (Lee et al. 2006) . The clear implications of this groundbreaking work is that disruption of nucleolar trafficking of a viral protein proves functional relevance and illustrates the potential of exploiting this knowledge for the generation of growth attenuated recombinant vaccines (Pei et al. 2008; Reed et al. 2006 Reed et al. , 2007 . Similarly, point mutations in the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) core protein that abolished nuclear and nucleolar localisation resulted in recombinant viruses with impaired replication in mammalian cells, compared to wild type virus (Mori et al. 2005; Tsuda et al. 2006) . Curiously, replication of recombinant viruses was not impaired in insect cells, illustrating this could potentially be related to differences in nucleolar architecture and proteomes between these cell types (Thiry and Lafontaine 2005) . The JEV core protein has been shown to interact with nucleophosmin and is translocated from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Flaviviruses in general (JEV, Dengue virus and West Nile virus) appear to have a part-nuclear stage to the synthesis of viral RNA and several components of the viral replicase together with newly synthesised RNA have been found in the nucleus of infected cells (Uchil et al. 2006) . One intriguing question that has yet to be elucidated is how such viral RNA traffics from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Most cellular mRNAs are spliced and it is part of the splicing process that signals nuclear export. Certain DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus saimiri, produce intron-less mRNA and these viruses have evolved specific viral proteins (such as herpesvirus saimiri ORF57 (Boyne et al. 2008a) ), which interact with the cellular mRNA export machinery (e.g. the mRNA processing and export factor ALY) to traffic viral mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Boyne et al. 2008b (Boyne et al. , 2010 Boyne and Whitehouse 2006) and a similar process might be required by RNA viruses. For example, tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) redistributes ALY from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and this might be a way the virus mediates host cell protein synthesis (Uhrig et al. 2004 ). In plants RNA silencing, a host defence mechanism targets virus RNAs for degradation in a sequence-specific manner and viruses use several mechanisms to counteract this system (Canto et al. 2006) . TBSV encodes a protein, P19, which interferes with this pathway. However, ALY might transport P19 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus or nucleolus and disrupt its silencing suppression activity. Nucleolin has also been shown to be involved in the trafficking of herpes simplex virus type 1 nucleocapsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Sagou et al. 2010) , drawing parallels with the involvement of nucleolar proteins in the movement of plant viruses (Kim et al. 2007a, b) . Different plant virus proteins involved in long-distance phloem-associated movement of virus particles or with roles in binding to the RNA virus genomes localise to the nucleolus and other sub-nuclear structures (Kim et al. 2007b; Ryabov et al. 2004 ). This may be mediated by association with nuclear proteins, as is the case with fibrillarin and the ORF3 protein of plant umbraviruses (Kim et al. 2007a) .",

The hepatitis delta virus genome also has differential synthesis in the nucleus with RNA being transcribed in the nucleolus (Huang et al. 2001) ; this is similar to the potato spindle tuber viroid where RNAs of opposite polarity are sequestered in different nuclear compartments, with the positive-sense RNA being transported to the nucleolus. Again localisation to different sub-nuclear strcutures may have different roles in the virus life cycle (Li et al. 2006 ). An intriguing recent discovery has been made showing that adenoassociated virus (AAV) encodes an additional protein called assembly-activating protein (AAP) that localises to the nucleolus and promotes assembly of the viral capsid (Sonntag et al. 2010) .",

            "text": "As a result of their limited genomes and coding capacities, recruitment of cellular proteins with defined functions in RNA metabolism would be a logical step to facilitate RNA virus infection. As nucleolar proteins have many crucial functions in cellular RNA biosynthesis, processing and translation, it comes as no surprise that nucleolar proteins are incorporated into the replication and/or translation complexes formed by RNA viruses. Given that some nucleolar proteins have many different functions, the same nucleolar protein might be used by a virus for different aspects of the replication pathway. Studies suggest that the human rhinovirus 3 C protease (3Cpro) pre-cursors, 3CD' and/or 3CD, localise in the nucleoli of infected cells early in infection and inhibit cellular RNA transcription via proteolytic mechanisms (Amineva et al. 2004 ). This general property is not restricted to human rhinovirus and in terms of the inhibition of cellular translation has also been described for encephalomyocarditis virus (Aminev et al. 2003a, b) , again suggesting roles in translational regulation.",

            "text": "Given the many roles of the nucleolus in the life cycle of the cell, including as stress sensor (Boulon et al. 2010; Mayer and Grummt 2005) , it would seem reasonable that comprehensive unbiased analysis of the nucleolar proteome would yield interesting data, particularly, with providing clues as to what cellular nucleolar functions may be altered by virus infection and what mechanisms the nucleolus may use to respond to this. How the nucleolar proteome changes in response to virus-infection has been investigated using stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled to LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics (Fig. 14.1) . These studies, led by our laboratories, have analysed purified nucleoli and the nucleus, and have directly stemmed from the pioneering work of the Lamond laboratory in analysing purified nucleoli using quantitative proteomics (Andersen et al. 2005 (Munday et al. 2010) . Overall, our data indicates that only a small proportion of nucleolar proteins change in abundance in virus-infected cells, Fig. 14. 1 Diagram of a \"classic\" SILAC experiment. This technology allows high-throughput quantitative proteomics and has been readily applied to the nucleolus, especially when coupled with dynamic live-cell imaging (Andersen et al. 2005) . The ability to simultaneously compare up to three different conditions through selection of the appropriate isotope label has enabled the recent studies of how the nucleolar proteome changes in virus-infected cells (Emmott et al. 2010a; Emmott et al. 2010b; Emmott et al. 2010c; Hiscox et al. 2010; Lam et al. 2010) and these tend to be virus-specific. For example, in adenovirus infected cells just 7% of proteins identified show a twofold or greater change compared to almost a third of nucleolar antigens showing a greater than twofold change when cells are treated with ActD which inhibits rRNA synthesis (Lam et al. 2010) . What is notable is that direct comparison between the adenovirus data set and the ActD dataset shows no clear correlation Lam et al. 2010) , further supporting the case that adenovirus induces effects on the nucleolus distinct from that of a generalised, non-specific shut down of nucleolar function. This fits well with a previous observation that adenovirus infection does not affect rRNA synthesis even 36 h post-infection (Lawrence et al. 2006 ). These results were initially surprising given the number of different viral proteins that can localise to this structure and how they interact with nucleolar proteins. This suggests that the nucleolar proteome and architecture is resilient during early stages of infection but may become disrupted as more and more damage accumulates inside cells because of virus activity, as clearly evidenced in live-cell imaging experiments (Bertrand and Pearson 2008; Dove et al. 2006b; ).",

These technologies could also be applied to large-scale analysis of viral proteins that traffic to the nucleolus and the cellular nucleolar proteins that they associate with (e.g. using SILAC and EGFP-traps (Trinkle-Mulcahy et al. 2008)), thus generating and integrating interactome networks with the nucleolar proteome during infection.",
