The COVID-19 epidemic is unique because of its scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media coverage. 1 It impelled the hospitals taking charge of the cases to face the many new challenges associated with the outbreak. 2 However, the resilience of health systems in response to COVID-19 is under question, including in high-income countries. 3, 4 Health system resilience can be defined as the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis, reorganise if conditions require it. 5 Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital is a 1000-bed University hospital in Paris belonging to the Assistance Publique -H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP), the largest hospital system in Europe employing more than 90,000 people in 39 hospitals. The hospital is one of the reference centres in France for patients with suspected or confirmed emerging infectious diseases, such as patients with Ebola or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Bichat hospital managed the first three COVID-19 cases in Europe diagnosed on January 24 , 2020 6 and has managed more than 400 COVID-19 patients since. On March 31, 2020 more than 280 patients with COVID-19 are hospitalized in the hospital including 65 in Intensive Care Units (ICU). In order to provide data on health systems resilience during COVID-19, we describe, at the hospital level, the key elements of the response to COVID-19 including the challenges and issues to anticipate following the experience of our centre (Table 1) .",

The management of the first infected patients was based on scientific data published since the start of the outbreak, as well as our experience from previous outbreaks (SARS and MERS-CoV). When the first patients arrived in January, we used the procedures for MERS-CoV 7 and also applied the principle of \"supervision\", developed for Ebola, with 4 to 6 head nurses from the most involved units (ID, IPC, ICU) who are trained to manage all the aspects of caring for suspected of confirmed cases together with logistical matters. In a context of dayto-day evolution of scientific information, it was necessary to adapt in real-time to new data and new guidelines were produced at a rapid pace. Informing all the HCWs of the new guidelines is a challenge that we met with regular information meetings and with the use of the intranet of the hospital. Education, training and exercises have been regularly organised since the beginning of the outbreak for frontline healthcare workers (HCW) to ensure that all HCWs caring for patients receive adequate information and training on PPE and clinical management of the patients.",

This unit was used first but as more beds were needed, we dedicated more and more units with a scale-up approach to the management of COVID-19 patients. On March 13, 2020 the 59 beds of Bichat hospital and the 13 beds of day hospital were exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 and the STI screening centre was used for COVID-19 screening and the follow-up of discharged COVID-19 patients. On March 16, we added the 60 beds of the rehabilitation unit of Bichat for the management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. On March 24, we had to use the internal medicine department (48 beds), then the pneumology department (28 beds) and on March 28 the cardiology department (27 beds). The ICU capacity increased up to 65 beds in the same time by mobilizing the three ICUs of our centre, as well as surgery theatres. We thus had to discharge all the patients who were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 or to transfer them to other hospitals. As previously reported by some Italian and Chinese colleague, many activities that are not related to COVID-19 had to be stopped in the midst of the epidemic. 8, 9 Despite this, medical staff in the ID department had to be doubled and then tripled night and day to cope with the increase of work and three teams were created: one to manage external calls, one to organise the testing of cases and one to take care of the infected patients. They first managed all the COVID-19 patients of the hospital but then had to let the other departments take care of their infected patients under the supervision of the IPC team. At first, doctors from the emergency department managed at night the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 outside of the ICU but a specific night duty service was soon needed, first with one ID resident and now with 6 residents and two senior consultants.",

The hospital had to call in temporary nurses to deal with COVID-19 but the epidemic arrived in a national context where public hospitals are at the centre of a protest movement due to, among other difficulties, the difficulty in recruiting HCWs and bed shortage. The existence of a large health system such as AP-HP was helpful to recruit nurses and other HCWs from outside the hospital and to organise support between different hospitals when absenteeism was a problem. Vacations were put on hold and many HCWs did extra hours that the hospital and AP-HP management committed to pay. HCWs who developed COVID-19 were managed in the hospital if needed or as outpatients and were put on sick leave for at least 7 days and 2 days free of symptoms. From March 18 onward, all the HWCs were asked to always put surgical masks in the hospital. Psychological support was offered to HCWs who take care of patients but also to those who may feel threatened or anxious. Media pressure about the COVID-19 epidemic has been felt at all levels: 10 rumours and global anxiety led to difficulties for the recruitment of temporary staff who sometimes refused to come to the hospital. The hospital management team had to reassure them and ensure that healthcare was not disrupted and doctors were not distracted from their missions. Internal communication was addressed with conferences open to all the HCWs of the hospital and information was shared on the intranet on a daily basis.",

This problem was resolved through the involvement of the IPC team and the head of the administrative staff of the hospital. The severity of the disease among patients made it necessary to perform CT scans in dedicated CT-scanners. The transport of the patients to other departments was found to be a critical point to anticipate. Patient movement circuits to avoid nosocomial spread had to be organised by the IPC team and forwarded to involved HCWs. The logistics services for medical equipment management had to adapt to a rapidly growing demand and provide the personnel with the necessary equipment for treatment. The security service was called upon to manage the arrival of journalists and the media, in particular to protect the entry of the ID and ICU departments. They were also mobilized to secure the patient transport circuits. The hospital switchboard was a key department to handle external calls about COVID-19.",

This support was, for example, necessary to accelerate the transfer of patients from the hospital to rehabilitation units, including patients with highly-resistant bacteria, such as carbapenemaseproducing Enterobacterales. The hospital's communication unit was crucial in informing the media about the management of the epidemic. Video interviews were conducted with experts and recognized leaders from different departments and circulated via traditional and social media to inform about the risk posed by the epidemic and to limit rumours. 11",
