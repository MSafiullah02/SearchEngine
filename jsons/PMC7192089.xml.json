This possibility is now accentuated by large number of COVID-19 cases in which the source of transmission could not be traced.

Inflammation is thought to underpin severe COVID-19, as laboratory investigations have also found elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) in severe COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020). These findings bear resemblance to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\u2014caused by the SARS CoV, another closely related coronavirus\u2014where cytokine storm and other dysregulated immune responses have been associated with disease pathogenesis (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005). While efforts are now focused on identifying antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, calls have been made to explore host-directed approaches to reduce the inflammatory response that is associated with severe COVID-19 (Zumla et al., 2020). However, the inflammatory response is dynamic and can fluctuate extensively from one day to another. Whether such dynamism is important to COVID-19 pathogenesis remains unknown; all studies thus far have analyzed blood collected over a range of time points from illness onset and combined into one phase of illness. If indeed the inflammatory and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dynamic, time from illness onset will need to be accurately controlled for informative analysis.",

We profiled the transcriptional changes in a panel of immune genes in three COVID-19 patients and ten healthy volunteers. We found a highly dynamic expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Expression of most of these genes peaked after the nadir of respiratory function, which calls into question the cytokine storm hypothesis. Instead, our data hints at the possibility that the IL1 pathway may be a more suitable correlate of severe respiratory disease. In addition, the attenuated cytokine expression associated with mild infection could also delay T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2, which prolongs infection; this suggests the possibility that afebrile and undifferentiated COVID-19 cases may drive virus spread in the community.",

            "text": "Analysis of RNA extracted from whole blood revealed a highly dynamic pro-inflammatory response in Case 1. Expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Case 1 (Figure 2\nA), represented by cluster 4 and consisting of mostly genes driving the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and inflammatory response as well as cytokine signaling pathways (Figure S1), was notably higher than in healthy controls (Table S1). Expression of most of these genes peaked on day 6 of illness. This peak in pro-inflammatory gene expression thus lagged behind the nadir of respiratory function on day 5 of illness (Figures 1C and 1D). Indeed, cytokines such as IL2, IL6, TNF, and IFNA1/13 were either expressed within the range of healthy controls or were induced only after respiratory function nadir (Figure S1F). Only expression of the cytokines IL1A and IL1B preceded the nadir of respiratory function (Figure 2B). Correspondingly, expression of IL1 receptor (Figure 2B) and the associated downstream signaling molecules (Figure S1E) was also induced before respiratory function nadir. These findings, albeit from a single subject, raise the possibility that global cytokine expression is not the cause of compromised respiratory function in COVID-19 patients. Instead, the finding of increased expression of IL1 and its associated signaling pathway suggests that COVID-19 pathogenesis may be driven by this pathway. If this is proven correct, licensed IL1 or IL1 receptor antagonists\u2014such as canakinumab and anakinra, respectively\u2014could potentially be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients to prevent respiratory dysfunction.",

            "text": "Another remarkable difference between Case 1 and Cases 2 and 3 as well as healthy controls were genes in cluster 3 (Figure 2A). In this cluster, mRNA of genes in the MHC class II\u2014such as HLA-DRB1, HLA-DMA, and HLA-DMB\u2014and T cell activation pathways\u2014such as IL23A and CD74\u2014were reduced in abundance in Case 1 compared to others (Figure S1). Accordingly, the CD4, CD8A, and CD8B mRNA transcript levels were the lowest among all the subjects (Figure 2C). Curiously, the expression of genes in these same pathways in Cases 2 and 3 were comparable with healthy controls (Table S1). These findings raise two possible explanations: first, Case 1 has reduced activation of adaptive immune genes, which unleashed the TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory response. Indeed, an experimental study has found that reduced T cell activation potentiates TLR-mediated inflammation in a positive feedback loop (Kim et al., 2007). Second and alternatively, increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in Case 1 could have led to recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood to sites of infection and the draining lymph nodes. That could have led to the mostly negative RT-PCR finding in the throat swabs from Case 1. In contrast, the lower pro-inflammatory responses in Cases 2 and 3 could have not only elicited mild symptoms but also led to a more attenuated T cell activation. Remarkably, Case 2 was afebrile throughout the period of isolation, and his cough resolved 10 days before SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR became negative. However, with an attenuated T cell response, SARS CoV-2 became prolonged as shown by the consistent viral RT-PCR positivity that lasted for nearly a month. In either case, our data suggests an important role for T cells in COVID-19. Defining the role of T cells in either the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 or prolonged SARS CoV-2 infection should thus be a priority, as the understanding of this would impact case management and virus transmission control, respectively.",

Indeed, because of the prolonged course of illness, we quickly reached the ethical limit of blood volume that could be collected. We focused on measuring RNA, as we were able to isolate total RNA from whole blood collected directly into a denaturing guanidine-based lysis buffer that would inactivate any viremia. Moreover, the use of additional methods, such as flow cytometry and ELISPOT assay, would not be pragmatic for this initial characterization of the immune response; these methods require larger blood volumes and manipulation in a suitably equipped biosafety level 3 containment laboratory. Notwithstanding the small sample size, we believe our findings can serve to guide design of more detailed studies, especially in the choice of sampling time points to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
