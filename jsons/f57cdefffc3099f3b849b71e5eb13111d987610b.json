Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock represent a continuum of increasing severity for which present defi nitions are not wholly satisfactory (Levy et al. 2003 ; Brilli and Goldstein 2005 ) . The term sepsis refers to the presence of an infection caused by a microbe that invades tissue, fl uid or a body cavity that is normally sterile, plus the presence of clinical and/or laboratory evidence of the systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS, temperature or leucocyte abnormalities and abnormal vital signs) . When sepsis is complicated by multi-organ failure, it is regarded as severe, while septic shock is diagnosed when sepsis coexists with a state of acute circulatory failure (Levy et al. 2003 ) .",

There is considerable variability in the pressures and fl ows delivered to infants with these systems (Dani et al. 2009 ; Lampland et al. 2009 ), and it is suggested that pressure limitation devices should be incorporated (Lampland et al. 2009 ).

While adults are likely to have normal to high cardiac output with low systemic vascular resistance in septic shock, children are more likely to have low cardiac output with high systemic vascular resistance (Ceneviva et al. 1998 ; Carcillo et al. 2002 ) . The impact of mechanical ventilation on haemodynamics depends on the interaction of many factors (Luecke and Pelosi 2005 ) including lung and chest wall mechanics (O'Quin et al. 1985 ) and characteristics of ventricular function (whether there is right, left or biventricular failure) (Bronicki and Anas 2009 ) . Cardiopulmonary interactions are generally complex (Bronicki and Anas 2009 ), more so in the critically ill (Pinsky 1985 (Pinsky , 1990 (Pinsky , 1994 (Pinsky , 1997 (Pinsky , 2005 (Pinsky , 2007 Jellinek et al. 2000 ) , and may be affected by a wide variety of issues in sepsis. Ventilation may alter venous return in patient with sepsis. For instance, in sepsis cardiac output may be decreased because of venodilatation and reduced venous return as well as high right atrial pressures due to positive pressure ventilation (Bronicki and Anas 2009 ). The relationship between ventilator pressures and right atrial pressure depends on the interaction between respiratory efforts and ventilator pressures, lung resistance and compliance, chest and abdominal wall compliance and the characteristics of the pericardium and cardiac muscle (Kingma et al. 1987 ) . Generally lung compliance in children is relatively low, while chest wall compliance is high, with the result that ventilator pressures are poorly transmitted to the right atrium. This may however not be true in sepsis, where the chest wall may become very non-compliant as a result of oedema, infl ammation and raised intraabdominal pressure.",
