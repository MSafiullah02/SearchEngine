CR1 is a receptor for the complement proteins C3b and C4b [10]. Via this receptor, erythrocytes carry immune complexes from the circulation to the spleen and liver, where the immune complexes are transferred to phagocytic cells [11]. Recently, it has been postulated that CR1 on erythrocytes may also be involved in the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins [12], [13], [14]. Besides a role in the clearance of immune complexes and lipoproteins, CR1 can also inhibit complement activation, by acting as a co-factor for the factor I-mediated breakdown of C3b into iC3b [10], [15].",

Accelerated and sometimes reversible loss of erythrocyte-CR1 has been described in patients with several types of inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome [19], tuberculosis [20], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [21] and systemic lupus erythematosus\n[22].

All statistical analyses were performed with PLINK statistical software (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/\u223cpurcell/plink/download.shtml#download). To control for multiple testing, we calculated global p-values using the tail strength method [30]. In short, the tail strength measures how much p-values in a set differ from the expected uniform distribution under the null hypothesis and sums up these differences into single-test statistics. The tail strength is powerful when many small effects exist in the data [30]. Since SNPs are not independent, empirical p-values were computed using permutations. SNPs were permuted as a block, keeping intact the relationship between covariates and outcome. Individual tests were based on a Cox-model (coxph) and 2 \u00d7 104 permutations were used. Computations were parallelized using package parallelize.dynamic\n[31]. Global p-values were computed using R version 3.2.",

The lower risk of MI, which we observed in carriers of the minor allele rs12034383 and rs6691117, and lower levels of CRP in rs12034383, are in line with the previously reported lower inflammation in these subjects [35]. Several markers of inflammation, including CRP [3], IL-6 [3] and white blood cell count [4], have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Several CR1 SNPs that were significantly associated with cardiovascular risk in the present study, were also associated with levels of CRP, but not with IL-6 or white blood cell count. CRP is synthesized in the liver, primarily in response to IL-6 [36]. When CRP binds to the phosphocholine groups on the surface of, for instance, bacteria, this activates the complement system and induces an inflammatory cascade to destroy the ligand [37]. Complexes of CRP with soluble ligands may bind to CR1 on the erythrocyte surface and thus be cleared from the circulation [38]. This direct interaction between CRP and CR1 may explain the observed association with the CR1 SNPs. In the present study, we found no evidence for a direct effect of CR1 gene polymorphisms on levels of IL-6 or leukocyte count.",

This may affect cardiovascular risk in several ways. Firstly, polymorphisms leading to lower expression of CR1 on these cells may result in reduced clearance of immune complexes from the circulation, resulting in a pro-inflammatory and therefore, a pro-atherogenic situation. Secondly, lower erythrocyte-CR1 expression may be pro-atherogenic due to less binding of atherogenic lipoproteins to erythrocytes. We have previously demonstrated in vivo that circulating human erythrocytes are able to bind atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins [12], [39]. The binding of these lipoproteins by circulating blood cells was associated with a reduced prevalence of atherosclerosis [12], [39]. Possibly, this binding of atherogenic particles by blood cells prevents their interaction with the endothelium, and we have speculated that erythrocytes contribute to removal of the lipoproteins from the circulation [40]. In vitro and ex vivo work from our group indicates that CR1 is a likely candidate receptor for the binding of lipoproteins to circulating blood cells [13].",

We do not know whether these SNPs lead to functional changes in the CR1 protein, although the observed relationship with CRP levels and the previously reported relationship with erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest functionality. Another limitation is that we did not correct for multiple testing with the more common Bonferroni correction. Due to the large number of SNPs analyzed, the Bonferroni adjusted p-value would have been 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 (0.05/73). However, we noticed by checking the haplotype structure within the gene, that there were only two major haploblocks with very strong LD. This indicates that the 73 investigated SNPs were not all independent of each other and that using the Bonferroni correction would have been too conservative. Instead, we used the tail strength method to control for multiple testing, since this test is powerful for studies with strong LD (dependency) and with small effect sizes. Since we found a significant p-value with this test as well, we consider our results to be valid and not false-positive. Another limitation is that these data were obtained in a single cohort, and these findings need to be confirmed in an independent cohort. In addition, we investigated a group of subjects aged 70 years and above. While the impact of CR1 gene polymorphisms, and their influence on inflammation and atherosclerosis, may be most pronounced in a group of elderly individuals, if CR1 gene polymorphisms lead to premature death before the age of 70, we may underestimate the true effect of these polymorphisms. Furthermore, future studies investigating the functionality of these CR1 SNPs are necessary.",
