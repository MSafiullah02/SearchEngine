Data deposited on TriTrypDB (tritrypdb.org) indicate that LbrPGF2S has been identified in the secretome of L. braziliensis and exosomes derived from Leishmania donovani. In addition, the Tropical Disease Research Targets Database (tdrtargets.org) indicates that the Leishmania major PGF2S (LmPGF2S) homolog has 13 putative antigenic epitopes with 77.8% antigenicity.

            "text": "The synthesis and functions of prostaglandins (PGs) are well characterized mainly in terms of mammalian physiology. In mammals, prostaglandin synthases catalyze the production of prostaglandins using arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites as substrates. AA is removed from membranes by the action of phospholipase A2 and converted into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 or COX-2). PGH2 is then converted into several metabolites, such as PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2\u03b1, by prostaglandin synthases (e.g. PGF2S) [6]. In mammals, PGF2\u03b1 is mostly related to ovulation, luteolysis, uterine contraction and the onset of labor [7]. However, it has been recently reported that PG production is not restricted to mammals, occurring in trypanosomatids [6] and other protozoan parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum [8] and Entamoeba histolytica [9] [10]. High levels of PGF2\u03b1 have been detected in Trypanosoma brucei, catalyzed by TbPGF2S from PGH2 [11]. The prostaglandin F2\u03b1 synthase activity has been demonstrated for three trypanosomatids orthologous genes. Roberts and colleagues [12] have shown that, in spite of the lack of credible cyclooxygenases, these parasites use arachidonic acid as a substrate to produce PGF2\u03b1. Additionally, these and other authors demonstrated that some of these kinetoplastid aldo-keto reductases metabolize toxic ketoaldehydes, playing a role as detoxification agents and possibly acting in cellular defense [12, 13]. However, the importance of these pathways for parasite biology and host interaction remains under-explored.",

In addition, a study on Leishmania infantum chagasi showed that PGF2S is highly expressed in metacyclic promastigotes [14]. These authors also observed an increase in lipid bodies (sites for prostaglandin synthesis in mammalian cells) in macrophages infected with L. infantum. In our study, we examined PGF2\u03b1 production in L. braziliensis, the expression profile of LbrPGF2S during promastigote development and its localization. Our results are indicative that LbrPGF2S might be transferred from intracellular parasites into the cytoplasm of mouse macrophages. This work, in conjunction with others [4, 14], lend weight to the hypothesis that PGs are parasite virulence factors.",

We then compared the protein sequence (Fig. 1b) and the 3D structure (Fig. 1c) of LbrPGF2S and the best characterized human PGF2S, AKR1C3 (NP_003730.4), and found 51.4% similarity and 34.3% identity. Additionally, in silico analysis of protein domains revealed the presence of two aldo/keto reductase domains (IPR18170) and a putative secretion cleavage signal near the C-terminus in the Leishmania PGF2S, suggesting that the protein might undergo proteolysis for subsequent export (Fig. 1b). A third aldo/keto reductase domain was detected in the C-terminal region of AKR1C3, but not in LbrPGF2S, probably due to I247V mutation in this enzyme. PGF2S orthologs in L. major (LmjF.31.2150), L. mexicana (LmxM.30.2150), L. infantum (LinJ.31.2210) and L. tarentolae (LtaP.31.2590) carry the predicted third Aldo-Keto domain present in the protein sequences from other organisms. In contrast, PGF2S from Leishmania braziliensis (LbrM.31.2410) and all the other Leishmania strains from the subgenus Viannia (deposited on TriTrypDB) lost the third domain, all of them carry a valine in the isoleucine position, which differs from the strains of the subgenus Leishmania.\n",

We then analyzed the presence of LbrPGF2S in the supernatant of stationary promastigote culture (day 7 post-inoculum). Promastigotes were removed by centrifugation and supernatants filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter, excluding parasites but not vesicles, such as exosomes. LbrPGF2S was detected by immunoblotting in both parasite lysates and culture supernatant (Fig. 2b). Indirect immunofluorescence using anti-LbrPGF2S antibody revealed cytoplasmic distribution of LbrPGF2S with a noticeably stronger signal near the flagellar pocket (Fig. 2c), a secretory organelle in trypanosomatids. To confirm that axenic L. braziliensis promastigotes produce PGF2\u03b1, the levels of PGF2\u03b1 in the culture supernatant were quantified at growth days 3 and 7 using an immunoenzymatic assay. Prior to evaluation, the cells were kept at either 26 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C for 4 h in the presence or absence of arachidonic acid (AA).

Since we detected the production of PGF2\u03b1 by promastigotes in axenic culture, we suggest that LbrPGF2S has the same catalytic function. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first, however, to observe that LbrPGF2S is expressed in amastigotes and localized in the host cell cytoplasm infected with Leishmania. Other authors have shown that vesicles released by Leishmania during in vitro or in vivo infection interfere with host cell response [20]. Recently, it has been shown that promastigotes secret exosomes into the midgut lumen of the sand fly vector and these extracellular vesicles are regurgitated with parasites into the skin during blood meal, modulating the immune response to Leishmania infection. Interestingly, the PGF2S protein was found among the 124 proteins identified by proteomic analysis in vesicles from L. infantum-infected midguts [21]. Although other experiments are needed to confirm LbrPGF2S secretion, our results are indicative of the transfer of the enzyme into the cytoplasm of infected macrophages. Other proteins secreted to the host cell cytoplasm, such as gp63, were shown to modulate phagocytic cell response [22, 23]. The process by which PGF2S reaches the cytoplasm of the host cell remains unknown, but we have shown that inhibition of the prostaglandin receptor affected negatively the infection profile of BMDM in vitro.",

Based on our results and those in the literature, we propose that the production of PGF2S improves the fitness of the parasite and might play a role in the mammalian host-parasite interaction. LbrPGF2S could be a new Leishmania virulence factor and is, therefore, a potentially attractive target for drug discovery or vaccine development.",

Anti-Tubulin antibody was used for protein loading control. b Secretion of LbrPGF2S by promastigotes in the axenic medium. Immunoblots were used to detect LbrPGF2S in logarithmic (L) and stationary (St) phase promastigotes, 3 and 7 days of culture, respectively, or in the supernatant of the stationary phase culture (S) using anti-LbrPGF2S. Parasite-free M199 medium (M) was used as a negative control. Blots were stained with Ponceau S (lower panel) for protein loading control. c Immunofluorescence imaging used to detect LbrPGF2S in wild type promastigotes (at stationary phase). LbrPGF2S (CF488A, green); tubulin (Alexa555, red); DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). An image of a single promastigote is shown bottom right; a strong fluorescence signal appears at the flagellar pocket (white arrow).
