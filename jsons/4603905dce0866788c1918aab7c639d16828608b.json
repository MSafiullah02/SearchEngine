            "text": "Cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) of higher eukaryotes and many viral RNAs are methylated at the N-7 and 29-O positions of the 59 guanosine cap by specific nuclear and cytoplasmic methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability 1 , the function of 29-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago 2-4 . Here we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 29-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild-type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signalling. 29-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 29-O MTase activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and, specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 29-O methylation of the 59 cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 29-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from non-self RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA probably serves as an example for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells.",

Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability 1 , the function of 29-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago [2] [3] [4] . Here we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 29-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild-type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signalling. 29-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 29-O MTase activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and, specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 29-O methylation of the 59 cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 29-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from non-self RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA probably serves as an example for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells.",

To assess whether differential 29-O methylation of viral RNA might affect suppression by IFIT-1 and/or IFIT-2, we evaluated infection in 3T3 MEFs expressing a murine Ifit1 or Ifit2 transgene. As observed in primary cells, WNV-E218A replication in control 3T3 cells was reduced (,5-to 60-fold decrease at 24-72 h, P , 0.05, n 5 3) compared with WNV-WT, confirming that 29-O methylation is required for optimal infectivity (Fig. 3a) . Transgenic expression of IFIT-2 reduced infection of WNV-WT (,56-to 100-fold decrease at 24-72 h, P , 0.0005, n 5 3) ( ",

We obtained a vaccinia virus (VACV) mutant (J3-K175R) that lacked 29-O MTase activity, replicated normally in BSC40 cells 22 but was attenuated in wild-type Mw (approximately six-to eightfold reduction at 24-72 h) and fully rescued in Ifnar1 2/2 Mw (Fig. 4a) . Growth curves with VACV-WT and VACV-J3-K175R in 3T3 cells expressing GFP or ISG20 confirmed an essential role of 29-O methylation in poxvirus infection (approximately three-to fivefold reduction at 24-72 h, P , 0.005, n 5 3) (Fig. 4b) . Transgenic expression of IFIT-2, however, did not affect replication of VACV-WT (P . 0.5, n 5 3), which suggests that IFIT-2 lacks activity against VACV-WT or that the virus efficiently antagonizes its antiviral effect. Expression of mouse IFIT-2 but not IFIT-1 further reduced infection of VACV-J3-K175R (6-to 25-fold decrease, P , 0.01, n 5 3) (Fig. 4c, d) . Consistent with these findings, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were resistant to lethal challenge with VACV-J3-K175R (0% lethality, n 5 6) but sensitive to infection with VACV-WT (100% lethality, n 5 13). In contrast, in Ifnar1 2/2 mice, VACV-J3-K175R was virulent as all animals succumbed to infection with similar kinetics compared with those infected with VACV-WT ( Supplementary Fig. 7) .",

Induction of Ifit family genes, several of which attenuate translation 19, 20, 24 , could preferentially recognize viral mRNA lacking 29-O methylation and selectively restrict propagation. Plants, which lack an IFN response network or Ifit family member orthologues, and their viruses, accordingly lack 29-O-methylation of mRNA.
