The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. By April 21, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had increased to more than 2,397,000 globally, with an overall mortality rate of 6.8%. 1 COVID-19 is mainly spread through direct contact or aerosol droplets. 2, 3 Whether endoscopy represents an aerosol-generating procedure remains unclear, but insufflation during endoscopic procedures could cause splash and aerosol droplets due to processes such as reflex vomiting, sneezing, and coughing. Contamination by such aerosol droplets may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In areas with many infected patients, about 10% of healthcare personnel (HCP) have been shown to contract COVID-19, and protection of HCP is recommended. 4 However, HCP involved in endoscopy face substantial risks due to the short physical distance between patients and personnel. Many endoscopic centers have thus reduced normal endoscopic activities. 5 Triage and assessment of risk from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 before endoscopy, regular monitoring of the supply and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and performance of endoscopies in a negative pressure room, when available, with strict isolation precautions for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are recommended. 2 In addition, urgent 2 endoscopies, such as for upper GI bleeding or severe cholangitis, should be performed by strategically assigned HCP to minimize risks of concomitant exposure. 2",

A single episode of reflex vomiting or cough was simulated by bursting a small nitrile rubber balloon containing 10 mL of fluorescent dye. The balloon was 3 attached to a tube and placed in the hypopharynx of the mannequin, then oxygen was pumped through the tube inside the mannequin until the balloon burst. Simulated endoscopy was then performed without and with placement of the endoscopic shield.

With the endoscopic shield, most dye was identified on the inner front surface of the cube, on the inner upside surface to a lesser extent, and not on other surfaces (Fig. 3) . A little dye was found only on the right glove, arm, and chest of the endoscopist, with none on the abdomen, socks (Fig. 2C ), face mask, or eye shield. Contamination of the floor was also minimal (Fig. 2D) . The endoscopic shield thus appeared to protect against the widespread dispersal of aerosol droplets.

Of course, our simulation only partially reproduced the true situation of endoscopy and could not identify whether the shield prevented widespread dispersal of smaller aerosol particles that could still prove infectious. In addition, access to the patient may be restricted by the device depending on the situation. However, the shield has the possibility of providing an additional level of protection against COVID-19 infection spreading during necessary endoscopic procedures. The prototype of the endoscopic shield was easy and inexpensive to produce, at a price of $40 USD; therefore, commercialization of this device is now planned. However, the shape and durability should be considered in detail for it to be commercialized.",
