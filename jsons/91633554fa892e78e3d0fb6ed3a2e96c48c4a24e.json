As the Spring Festival holiday ended, stringent social distancing measures and mobility restrictions were coordinated and implemented by the central and local governments in many Chinese megacities (ie, the largest and wealthiest; figure 1), including Beijing (north of Wuhan), Guangzhou and Shenzhen (south), Shanghai and Hangzhou (east), and Chengdu (west). For example, only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down.

On the other hand, COVID-19 has spread to more than 100 countries or regions, and local epidemics have been established in multiple countries, including the USA and most countries in Europe. On March 10, Italy, the worst-hit country outside China, with more than 10 000 cases, imposed a nationwide lockdown, which is expected to be in place until at least early April. Most countries in Europe have imposed stringent control measures to limit social contacts. As COVID-19 con tinues to spread globally, escalating case importation from overseas or residual infected seeds within China (despite the almost 2-month-long containment policy nationwide), coupled with the resumption of economic activities, a second wave of COVID-19 appears probable. Thus, we simulated the potential consequences of relaxing restrictions in anticipation of a recrudescence of infections.",

(4) The time between dates of symptom onset (ie, serial interval) of 56 infector-infectee pairs, among which six pairs were from Hubei published by Li and colleagues; 8 14 pairs from secondary infections linked to exported cases outside mainland China; two and 23 pairs from the Zhuhai and Shenzhen line lists, respectively; and 11 from a family cluster in Jiangsu, reported by Huang and colleagues 9 (appendix pp 7-9). (5) The delay between symptom onset and reporting were calculated for each case in both Shenzhen and Wenzhou. The onset date was not available for 225 (55%) of 411 cases in Beijing and any case in Shanghai. As such, we estimated the onset dates of these cases based on their date of reporting, and assuming that the time between onset and reporting was statistically the same as that of the 186 (45%) of 411 cases in Beijing whose onset dates were known. We used the date when each case was reported on the website of local health commissions as the reporting date. The empirical mean time from symptom onset to reporting was 4\u00b79 days (SD 3\u00b73) for Beijing, 7\u00b76 days (4\u00b72) for Shenzhen, and 6\u00b73 days (4\u00b74) for Wenzhou.

As one of the cities that is not a provincial capital, but has the highest volume of mobility with Wuhan, 17, 20 Wenzhou had the earliest imported cases, as expected. Symptom onset of its first imported case was as early as Dec 24, 2019. Wenzhou was also the first city outside Hubei to be locked down. R t remained lower than 1 for both Beijing and Shenzhen, after discounting the large proportion of imported cases from Hubei, suggesting local transmission of COVID-19 has not been sustained, despite the early importation from Wuhan. The onset date of Shenzhen's first imported case was Jan 1; this case belonged to the first family cluster reported in Guangdong province. 6, 21 In all four selected cities, the posterior mean of R t decreased substantially, after massive control measures were implemented on Jan 23, and R t remained lower than 1 after the Spring Festival holidays had ended.

As such, we posit that cCFR in areas outside Hubei should be roughly comparable to the symptomatic CFR (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) in Wuhan (estimated to be 1\u00b74% [0\u00b79-2\u00b71] in a separate analysis 19 ) after adjusting for the respective age distributions of the reported cases in the different cities and provinces (which was older in Hubei and therefore associated with higher COVID-19 fatality). Figure 5 indicates that relaxation of intervention increased the cumulative case count exponentially with the duration of relaxation, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push prevalence back to pre-relaxation level; and the required duration of such interventions would always be longer than the duration of intervention relaxation unless R t was below 1\u00b75 during intervention relaxation, and could be pushed below 0\u00b75 during stage 4. Taken together, these results suggest that allowing R t to rise above 1 when the epidemic size was still small (ie, no herd immunity) would likely incur both health and economic loss even if aggressive interventions could push the prevalence back to pre-relaxation level afterwards.",

Close monitoring of the instantaneous effective reproduction number and T /T real-time tuning of policy interventions to ensure a manageable second wave remains the over-riding public health priority. Early detection of cases is essential.

            "text": "Our schematic scenario simulated how control measures could be tuned to minimise the total infected burden, thus corollary adverse health, and social and economic effects, by maintaining the effective reproduction number below the self-sustaining threshold of 1. Our results highlight that as the number of cases would progressively rise when R t > 1, simply tightening control interventions again to maintain R t = 1 would not reduce the burden back to its original baseline. Once elevated at the higher level, it could only be pushed back down to the original baseline by extra effort, by driving R t down below unity. Therefore, relaxation of interventions to allow R t > 1 would probably incur both marginally higher health and economic loss, even if the disease prevalence could subsequently be pushed back to prerelaxation level. Thus, proactively striking a balance between resuming economic activities and keeping R t below 1 is likely to be the optimal strategy until effective vaccines become widely available, despite the fact that control policies, including social distancing, behavioural change, and public awareness, will probably be maintained for some time. 24 China could adopt a reinforcement learning approach to achieve such a delicate balance (namely, maximising economic productivity under the R t \u2264 1 constraint) by continuous surveillance of the effect of social mixing and human mobility on the reproduction number of COVID-19 and then tune socioeconomic activities accordingly. In the conventional framework of inferring R t from epidemic curve data (as we have done), the lead time between actual changes in R t and the detection of such changes is roughly equal to the sum of the incubation period and reporting delay (although the latter could be adjusted for, as we have done). We postulate that such lead time might be shortened if reliable analytics could be developed to predict R t from digital proxies for social mixing and human mobility. Specifically, the resumption of economic activities and normal societal functions can be digitally monitored in various ways by the cloud platforms of Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. 25 As of March 10, the Alipay and WeChat Health Code system had been used more than 1\u00b76 billion times, and its usage patterns reflect the level of economic activities in real time. 26 The decline in R t in the four selected cities correlated with the decrease in intracity traffic volumes recorded by Baidu (appendix p 6). Using the intracity traffic volume on Jan 1-15 as the index, to date, the level of economic activities of the four selected cities have been at half the normal pre-outbreak levels. Closely monitoring R t and such digital indices could enable finetuning of control measures to effectively minimise the potential adverse effects of a possible second wave of infections. Given the pivotal role of R t in epidemic control, we suggest that real-time estimates of R t should be presented in the routine COVID-19 dashboards and situation reports for provincial, national, and supra national health agencies.",

For example, even in the most prosperous and well resourced megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, with 5\u00b77, 6\u00b70, and 3\u00b77 hospital beds per 1000 population, respectively, health-care resources are finite. 27 If 20% of COVID-19 cases were to require hospital admission 28 and infection prevalence was 0\u00b75% at any single point in time, Shenzhen would be required to deploy 27% of its total number of hospital beds. The Chinese health-care system still relies heavily on secondary and tertiary care, 29, 30 and hospitals overcrowded with patients with COVID-19 could displace care rendered to other patients who have non-COVID-19 health-care needs. This situation has already been observed in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei. 31 We also found that fatality risks, among officially confirmed cases that are adjusted for resolution ascertainment bias, vary by several folds between provinces. The cCFR was relatively low in south and east China, and substantially higher in the north and northwest, which also correlates with provincial per capita gross domestic product (appendix pp 4, 11) . Prosperous regions, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, had the lowest cCFRs among provinces that had more than 500 confirmed cases, whereas less developed regions, such as Henan, Hebei, and Heilongjiang, had the highest cCFRs. Guangdong, the richest province in the country, has the largest number of migrant workers in China and thus a high proportion of imported cases of COVID-19 from Hubei. 12 Guangdong's health-care system, with the second lowest number of hospital beds per 10 000 population, sustained an enormous stress to its surge capacity, which is perhaps reflected by its mid-level cCFR ranking. Similarly, for megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Shenzhen, the cCFRs ranked in the middle, despite their economic prosperity and relatively robust health-care infrastructure (appendix pp 5, 11). Although we did not have data on the proportion of hospital beds occupied during the first wave, given that there were fewer than 1000 confirmed cases in most cities and provinces (compared with approximately 123 600, 139 000, and 45 700 hospital beds overall in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, respectively), it was unlikely that the additi onal burden could have been overwhelming for the health systems outside Hubei.",

Although there might be less under-reporting and ascertainment bias in provinces outside Hubei, our work shows the fundamental importance of a regularly (preferably daily) updated and sufficiently detailed line list. Second, the estimation of R t relied on an accurate estimate of the serial interval distribution, where nearly half of the publicly available paired infector-infectee data points are currently derived from Shenzhen (appendix pp 7-9). Third, travel history or epidemiological links to Hubei were another essential element, because the proportion of imported cases varied over time and across locations. Although most cases in Wenzhou were local cases since Feb 4, the majority of confirmed cases in Shenzhen consisted mostly of imported cases from Hubei even up until Feb 12-more than 2 weeks after the Wuhan lockdown on Jan 23. Fourth, the simulations of intervention relaxation were done for a limited number of illustrative scenarios regarding temporal changes in the reproduction number. We did not attempt to relate which interven tions and public responses to the epidemic might correspond to each of these scenarios.",

The proportion was even higher if we considered that some imported cases formed clusters with their close contacts in Hubei (although such information was missing in the Shenzhen line list). Further investigation of the transmission dynamics within households would require detailed data on household composition and demographics of household members, 32-34 importantly including healthy members who were not infected. 21 We found that R t estimates were difficult to interpret if we included the two potential superspreading events in the prisons for the R t estimation in Zhejiang and Shandong (figure 3; appendix pp 1-2). However, the number of superspreading events is increasing as COVID-19 spreads outside mainland China; for example, in places of worship in Hong Kong and Daegu of South Korea, in a mental health facility in Daegu, and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. A comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases in each superspreading event cluster will be essential to understand the transmission of superspreading events. Combining information on COVID-19 transmission in the superspreading events, households, and community would enable better understanding of the overall R t estimates, which would further enhance the effectiveness of control measures, if they are accordingly and precisely designed.",

As economic activity continues to resume in the coming weeks, real-time assessment by monitoring the instantaneous effective reproduction number could allow policy makers to tune relaxation decisions to maintain transmissibility to below the self-sustaining threshold of 1. CFRs vary between provinces, which might be determined by health-care availability, quality, and surge capacity. Therefore, health services planning should be opti mised to minimise mortality related to COVID-19.",
