The massive number of cases admitted to emergency departments and the rapid evolution to respiratory failure have quickly depleted critical care resources, especially respiratory support equipment, such as ventilators, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. In this context, any therapeutic and oxygenation support strategy that conserves medical resources should be welcomed. Prone positioning is a well-known ventilatory support strategy to improve oxygenation levels, typically applied in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The proposed mechanism by which this strategy works involves reducing ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and making lung perfusion more uniform [1,2]. Here, we describe our experience with two COVID-19 patients who presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and were admitted to the ICU. Both cases were successfully managed with self-proning and noninvasive oxygenation, without the need for intubation.",

The massive number of patients with respiratory failure admitted to the emergency wards have rapidly depleted medical resources, which are more critical in low- and middle-income countries. As an additional pressure on hospital stockpiles, concerns related to the risks involving aerosol generation that could potentially increase virus dispersion, have precluded the use of noninvasive ventilatory strategies and have promoted earlier intubation [3]. In this setting, any respiratory support strategy that can conserve critical medical resources should be carefully evaluated.",

Placing the patient in the prone position results in more uniform alveolar architecture and perfusion, thus reducing regional V/Q mismatch and improving oxygenation. The consequent improvement in oxygenation leads to further improvement of the V/Q mismatch and is associated with reduced mortality [1,2]. In one previous study, this strategy was successfully applied in 20 awake, non-intubated patients with moderate to severe ARDS [4]. In that study, early prone positioning combined with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy/noninvasive ventilation (HFNC/NIV) avoided the need for intubation in more than half of the patients, and the PaO2/FiO2 increased by 25\u201335 mmHg in those patients [4].",

In the patient described in case 2, however, the improvement in PaO2 seen in the blood gas analysis after prone positioning was paradoxically accompanied by a slight worsening of the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) The expected change in PaCO2 during prone positioning may be variable. The behavior of the PaCO2 depends mainly on that of the alveolar ventilation and its relationship with the total ventilated lung volume [1].
