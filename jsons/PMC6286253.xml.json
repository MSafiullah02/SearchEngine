Studying patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) provides a unique perspective on the degree to which altered immunity may influence the human microbiome and how, in turn, microbiota may interact with the host to drive disease. Skin-associated bacterial and fungal communities in patients with PID displayed increased ecological permissiveness with decreased site specificity and temporal stability19. We sought to investigate the potential eukaryotic virome composition and stability in a population of patients with PID with a high frequency of severe, recalcitrant cutaneous and systemic viral infections. DOCK8 deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive, combined immunodeficiency within the spectrum of hyper-IgE syndromes5. In addition to recurrent cutaneous and sinopulmonary infections, these patients can suffer from severe food allergies with anaphylaxis, eczematous dermatitis with bacterial skin infections, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and cancer susceptibility. The cutaneous viral-associated manifestations of DOCK8 deficiency include molluscum contagiosum, herpesvirus infections, and warts (HPV infections) along with atopic dermatitis (Fig. 1a and ref. 5).",

We overcame the technical hurdle of extracting sufficient biomass for sequencing from noninvasive skin samples and collected a total of 207 skin and nares swabs from DOCK8-deficient patients; within-patient samples were combined based on skin physiology and/or anatomical proximity to achieve sufficient RNA for sequencing (see Methods for details). We generated 31 Gb of rRNA-subtracted, microbial RNA-seq data from four combined skin sites of 26 DOCK8-deficient patients (Supplementary Table 13). The majority of viral RNA reads mapped to DNA viruses, mostly Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae (Supplementary Table 14), which may indicate active viral replication. The relative abundances of the genera of polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses detected in the RNA and DNA datasets were highly similar (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The nares of DOCK8-deficient patients revealed colonization with several RNA viral families, including members of Coronaviridae (coronavirus species), Picornaviridae (rhinovirus, enterovirus, and kobuvirus species), Orthomyxoviridae (influenza), and Paramyxoviridae (parainfluenza) (Fig. 4a). Using reference-free de novo assembly of viral and unmapped RNA reads, we identified contigs with 85\u201397% identity to distinct reference human rhinovirus (HRV) genomes, in multiple samples from three different patients. From these, we constructed two full genomes of putative novel rhinovirus variant and genotype (Rhinovirus A genome detected in a single patient and a Rhinovirus B genome detected in two other patients), with 89 and 80% nucleotide identity to the closest genotype (A60 and B93), respectively, at the VP1 gene used for phylogenetic assignment (Supplementary Fig. 7b). One DOCK8-deficient patient exhibited high relative abundances of rubella virus, whose genome carried signature mutations of the vaccine strain. Among the nine patients who had RNA viruses detected in their nares, five had undergone clinical laboratory testing for respiratory pathogens and three of these five had positive results that directly corresponded to clinical laboratory results (D8_Pt16, D8_Pt19, D8_Pt21). The other two patients had negative clinical tests and notably lower relative abundances (less than 0.5%) of rhinovirus (D8_Pt20) and parainfluenza (D8_Pt20, D8_Pt21).",

We investigated whether the presence of cutaneous warts or molluscum contagiosum lesions was associated with the relative abundances of HPV and MCV viral reads, respectively. The mean percentages of HPV and MCV reads were statistically significantly higher in the presence of any cutaneous warts (mean 89% HPV reads) and any molluscum contagiosum lesions (mean 8% MCV reads), respectively, compared with absence of these cutaneous lesions (Fig. 4b,c). However, even in the absence of any clinical warts, the DOCK8-deficient patients harbored high relative abundances of HPV reads (mean 52%). In contrast, the mean relative abundances of MCV reads in patients without clinical molluscum contagiosum lesions were quite low (mean, 0.4%). The differences in the subclinical presence of HPV versus MCV viruses suggests biological distinctions between these eukaryotic viruses, with patient skin demonstrating less susceptibility to MCV carriage than to HPV carriage.",

Expanding knowledge of HPV diversity may promote the development of computational tools for predicting and assigning unknown sequences from metagenomics surveys and of molecular assays for rapid identification of viruses with oncogenic potential, such as some members of the HPV community. As DOCK8-deficient patients are susceptible to squamous cell cancers, future studies may be able to address whether HPVs detected on DOCK8-deficient skin have oncogenic potential.",

To identify divergent papillomavirus genomes, we eliminated the coverage requirement and identified another 183 contigs as likely Papillomaviridae on the basis of contig size (~7 kb) and L1 typing. A similar search for divergent Polyomaviridae returned no additional contigs. From 8,914 Papillomaviridae contigs, we subsetted 3,725 that were within a size range of 6\u20138 kb, which is similar to the size of an average HPV genome (~7.9 kb). These genomes were masked using an HPV reference downloaded from the PaVe database (ref. 42 and www.pave.niaid.nih.gov) to remove all regions \u2265500 nt with more than 90% identity by BLASTN. Genomes with \u22654,000 nt unmasked were kept, resulting in 2,189 genomes. Papillomaviridae have circular genomes, which is problematic for alignment-based clustering algorithms, so the Mash algorithm43 was used instead to build a graph of 95% identical contigs that were then clustered using SPICi44. This threshold was set to remove redundant genomes but still retain genomes that are distant enough to represent distinct HPV types. This clustering resulted in 208 cluster seeds and 42 singleton genomes, yielding a final pool of 250 nonredundant HPV genomes. Using BLASTN to compare these 250 nonredundant genomes with themselves, we verified that their nucleotide identity between cluster representatives did not exceed 90%.",

This resulted in 23 Poxviridae contigs that were mostly masked, 6 Herpesviridae contigs (size range 750\u20131800 nt), all assembled from the same sample (patient D8_Pt21) that mapped to cytomegalovirus genomes not included in our database, and 4 Anelloviridae contigs (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Three of the Anelloviridae contigs (in the genus Torque teno virus) were assembled from two samples from patient D8_Pt13, with contig sizes of 1,980, 1,270, and 1,599 nt. The fourth contig was assembled from a sample from a different patient (contig size 1,357 nt, D8_Pt11). These contigs were amplified by PCR using targeted primers from the original DNA extracted from the skin swab and sequences verified with Sanger sequencing. Owing to low coverage of these contigs, we were not able to amplify and assemble a complete genome of these putative novel anelloviruses. A novel anellovirus genotype has been defined as the ORF1 gene having <90% shared nucleotide identity when aligned to any reference genotype, whereas designation as a novel anellovirus species requires <50% sequence identity. Assembled contigs were aligned to reference genomes in our viral database using MUSCLE47 v3.8.31 to determine the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses (Supplementary Fig. 4c). The resulting alignment was used to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, using FastTree48 v2.1.9 and visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).",

However, since rRNA reads represented a significant portion of the data, some of the samples had a very low number of reads (the lowest sample having only 35,331 filtered reads). As a consequence, the assembly yielded a large number of contigs (625,306) with only about one-third passing quality filtration (206,371) (Supplementary Table 17). Of these, 122,771 were assigned according to our contig analysis pipeline, and only 24,217 were a hit to a viral genome. Almost all viral contigs were assigned to DNA viruses (mainly Papillomaviridae), in accordance with the high abundance we detected in read mapping from both DNA and RNA data. A total of 1,458 contigs were assigned to RNA viruses. We detected several contigs from the rhinovirus family, in patients D8_Pt16, D8_Pt21, and D8_Pt22. Contigs from patient D8_Pt16 were identified as a variant of Rhinovirus A60, and contigs from patients D8_Pt21 and D8_Pt22 were identified as a variant of Rhinovirus B97. The Picronaviridae study group defines novelty of a rhinovirus genotype by the coding sequence of the conserved VP1 gene, with slight differences between the species; an HRV type should have at least 13% (HRV-A) or 12% (HRV-B) nucleotide divergence from all other HRV types. Nucleotide divergence lower than this threshold has been used to assign new variants of a genotype49,50. With primers designed at terminal contig sequences and cDNA derived from the original patient RNA, we amplified across the gaps, Sanger sequenced, and assembled two complete novel rhinovirus variants and genotypes (~7 kb), as classified by the conserved VP1 protein49,50 (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Contigs that were unassigned at first were blasted again with adjusted parameters in BLASTN and BLASTX modes against the nonredundant databases and were predominantly partially matched to bacterial or eukaryote genomes and proteins.",
