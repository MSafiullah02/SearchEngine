The first is more likely related to ischemic injury caused by hemodynamic insufficiency and hypoxic-ischemic injury4 rather than a coalescence of factors that result in intestinal inflammation and injury largely as a result of intestinal immaturity, as in the preterm infant. In the latter case, sometimes referred to as classic NEC,2 the interactions of a predisposing genetic background, an immature intestinal barrier, and a microbial environment that is conducive to the development of NEC are believed to play an interactive and critical role in pathogenesis.2, 3, 5\n",

Using this approach, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons are sequenced using novel high-throughput pyrosequencing technology. Based on the degree of nucleotide similarity (usually between 95% and 99%), sequences can be binned into operational taxonomic units that form the basis for comparisons of microbiota composition and diversity between samples.",

The importance of carbohydrate metabolism is also evident from the enormous amount of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) present in the gut microbiome.

Despite the putative importance of these metabolic functions, few studies are available as they pertain to NEC in the neonate.",

Bacterial DNA was subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and library sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The distribution of samples from patients with NEC distinctly clustered separately from controls. Intestinal bacterial colonization in all preterm infants was notable for low diversity. Patients with NEC had even less diversity, an increase in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, a decrease in other bacteria species, and had received a higher mean number of previous days of antibiotics. These results suggested a relationship with previous use of antibiotics in patients with NEC.

Several molecular signatures were identified to be increased in NEC cases 1 week before and within 72 hours of NEC development.

It will be important to dissect the factors that contribute to these differences, which may begin in fetal life (see Fig. 3). Recent PCR-based studies estimate the prevalence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity to be 30% to 50% higher than that detected by cultivation-based methods.24 These studies have shown that cultivation-resistant anaerobes belonging to the family Fusobacteriaceae (particularly Sneathia sanguinegens and Leptotrichia spp) are also commonly found in amniotic fluid. Other diverse microbes detected by PCR of amniotic fluid include as-yet uncultivated and uncharacterized species. A causal relationship between diverse microbes, as detected by PCR, and preterm birth is supported by types of association (eg, space, time, and dose) proposed as alternatives to Koch's postulates for inferring causality from molecular findings. Whether this colonization affects the gastrointestinal tract of the fetus is not known, but the fact that the fetus swallows large quantities of amniotic fluid during the last trimester of pregnancy and the recent finding that microbial DNA is present in meconium suggest that the fetal intestine is exposed to the amniotic fluid microbes. The high sensitivity of the fetal intestine to inflammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) suggests that in utero microbes may trigger intestinal inflammation in utero25 Furthermore, it can be speculated that exposure of the intestinal tract to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists such as LPS, flagellin, or microbial CpG in low quantities may also make the intestine tolerant to further inflammatory stimuli.26\n",

This trend is reflected in many parts of the world, with the most populous country in the world, China, approaching 50% and some private clinics in Brazil approaching 80%. Concurrent with the trend of increasing deliveries by cesarean section, there has been an epidemic of both autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, and multiple sclerosis, and allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. The occurrence of these diseases is higher in more affluent, Western, industrialized countries. As reviewed in Ref,30 several previous studies have shown differences in microbial colonization after cesarean section and vaginal deliveries. A more recent study,31 in which nonculture-based sequencing technology was used, examined the early stages of the colonization of the body by microbes. Babies born vaginally were colonized predominantly by Lactobacillus, whereas babies delivered by cesarean section were colonized by a mixture of potentially pathogenic bacteria typically found on the skin and in hospitals, such as Staphylococcus and Acinetobacter, suggesting that babies born by cesarean delivery were colonized with skin flora in lieu of the traditionally vaginal type of bacterium.32 The data relating these changes to later outcomes such as celiac disease, allergies, and atopy are compelling, but a relationship of cesarean section versus vaginal delivery, intestinal colonization, and the development of NEC has not been found.",

In 1 study, it was speculated that the abnormal pattern of colonization early at birth with delayed bloom of more pathogenic bacteria late in preterm infants could potentially explain those patients who develop NEC.23 Sullivan and colleagues33 in 1 multicenter study using donor human milk showed that an exclusively human milk-based diet is associated with significantly lower rates of NEC and surgical NEC when compared with a mother\u2019s milk-based diet that also includes bovine milk-based products. The reduction in NEC using strategies of only human milk was of 50% for clinical NEC and almost 90% for surgical NEC. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of NEC was estimated to be 10. In a recent policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding breastfeeding and the use of human milk, the recommendation was to offer donor milk to all preterm infants in whom mother\u2019s own milk is unavailable.43\n",

Often, their use is justified, but sometimes, it is the product of fear of infections in the preterm infant. Nevertheless, the use of antibiotics in neonates and especially in the preterm infant has unintended and sometimes devastating consequences. Antibiotic exposure may reduce the diversity of intestinal microbiota, delay the colonization of beneficial bacteria, and predispose preterm neonates to NEC. Previous studies44, 45, 46 have shown that duration of antibiotic exposure is associated with an increased risk of NEC among neonates without previous sepsis. One study47 found that overgrowth of pathogenic species is increased after 3 days of antimicrobial exposure. In the United States, most mothers giving birth prematurely are treated with antibiotics and many very-low-birth-weight infants are treated with a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin and gentamicin. Studies28 have shown the detrimental effects of antibiotics to the intestinal flora, even after 1 dose of antibiotics with alterations in the intestinal microbiota that could take years to recover. One study48 showed a decrease in diversity, a predominance of less desirable bacteria and highly resistant clones with abundance of specific resistance genes as a result of antibiotic exposure that did not recover after 2 years after exposure. Cotten and colleagues49 found that each empiric treatment day with antibiotic was associated with increased odds of death, NEC, and the composite measure of NEC or death. These investigators concluded that prolonged initial empiric antibiotic therapy may be associated with increased risk of NEC or death and should be used with caution.",

            "text": "The intestinal flora in the neonate have important functions in metabolism, nutrition, immune system, and defense against pathogens.53, 54 The immune system is developmentally regulated; therefore, in preterm babies, this immune system is still immature. Normally, it recognizes and fights harmful bacteria but does not react against healthy species of bacteria.55, 56 To avoid triggering pathologic immune responses, commensal bacteria must not express key virulence factors. For example, LPS is pentacylated in Bacteroides species, which are abundant in the intestinal flora of breast-fed, healthy infants. This modification makes lipid A in commensal Bacteroides a poor agonist of TLRs.57 Conversely, lipid A of Proteobacteria is a potent agonist of TLR-4 and more likely to elicit an immune response because of its hexacylated characteristics.58, 59 The intestinal mucosa has mechanisms of recognition of bacterial products via highly specialized pattern recognition receptors called TLRs, which recognize specific microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs).60 Each MAMP has its own specific TLR.61 For example, LPS, which acts as the endotoxin for gram-negative bacteria, is recognized by TLR-4. Flagellin is recognized by TLR-5, whereas peptidoglycan and lipotechoic acid from gram-positive bacteria are detected by TLR-2. TLR expression seems to be regulated by patterns of intestinal colonization, and therefore, abnormal patterns of colonization can trigger inappropriate responses. These MAMPs activate the specific TLR that leads to the activation of nuclear factor \u03ba B (NF-\u03baB) and caspases, which in turn activate transcription genes and induce cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and interferon (IFN-1) (Fig. 4\n). Commensal healthy bacteria are believed to regulate this intestinal inflammatory response.60, 62 For example, studies have shown that Lactobacillus protects against cytokine-mediated cell injury.63\nBifidobacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Streptococcus thermophilus are examples of other bacteria that play a role in cytoprotection of the enterocyte and intestinal mucosa.64 Many of these bacteria have been studied as therapeutic agents in the treatment of NEC, with promising results. Several studies, including a recent meta-analysis of the literature,65, 66 showed that the incidence of NEC was decreased in infants treated with probiotics containing different combination of these beneficial bacteria. Probiotics seems to help maintain a normal intestinal flora in neonates, thereby decreasing the incidence of NEC. Current evidence led to a recommendation level B in 2011 of effectiveness (recommendation is based on positive-controlled studies, but 1 negative study did not support the primary outcome).67 Others68, 69 have suggested that dead microbes may be as effective as live microbes in modulating excessive inflammatory stimuli (see Fig. 4).",

Disruption of the tight junction zonulin proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and occludin leads to intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation.73 Few studies have shown the relationship between bacterial translocation and NEC. In 1 study74 of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in very-low-birth-weight infants, BSI was more common after diagnosis of NEC in very-low-birth-weight infants who developed intestinal failure (60%) compared with those with surgical NEC without intestinal failure (42%) and those with medical NEC (20%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella were the most frequently identified microorganisms. Alteration in the intestinal permeability was believed to be one of the mechanisms of BSI. Causation is difficult to establish. Nonculture-based analyses of intestinal microbiota have given us some indication of the alterations in diversity and intestinal flora composition of those infants who develop NEC.",

In a study performed several years ago, Carrion and Egan77 reported that by maintaining an acidic gastric pH less than 3.0, the incidence of NEC decreased and higher gastric enteric bacterial colony counts were strongly correlated with gastric pH level of more than 4.",

Cell stimulation signals recruitment of MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6, then triggers activation of I\u03baB. NF-\u03baB activates the transcription of genes, including cytokines and chemokines.
