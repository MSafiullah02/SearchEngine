After in-flight announcement offering medical attention to those with fever or respiratory symptoms, consenting disembarking pilgrims were interviewed for respiratory symptoms, offered medical examination and testing for respiratory viruses by a medical team stationed in the arrival halls of the Srinagar International Airport, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The demographic and clinical features were recorded on a predefined case record form. Enrollment for testing was offered to those with respiratory symptoms (n=977); 300 consented. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar, India, and all 300 participants gave written informed consent. Twin swabs (nasopharyngeal and throat) were obtained from each participant, pooled in viral transport media; and then transported to the Influenza laboratory in SKIMS, within 3-4 h of collection. After testing for influenza and MERS-coV at SKIMS, the samples were transported to the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, where testing for respiratory viruses was performed using in-house standardized duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using previously published primers and probes. Briefly, eight tubes duplex PCR was performed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV)1112, rhinovirus and ribonuclease protein (RNP)11, parainfluenzaviruses (PIV) 1 and 21113, PIV 3 and 41113, adenovirus and boca virus111415, coronavirus OC 43 and NL 651116, corona virus 229E and enterovirus111316. From 100 \u03bcl clinical specimen RNA was extracted using the MagMax automated RNA extractor as per the manufacturer details. Real-time RT PCR assays were carried out using the Invitrogen Superscript III one-step quantitative RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed on ABI 7500 machine (Applied Biosystems Inc, USA) in a 25 \u03bcl PCR reaction containing 10 picomol of each forward and reverse primer, 5 picomol of TaqMan probe, 12.5 \u03bcl \u00d72 buffer, 0.5 \u03bcl Superscript III enzyme and 5 \u03bcl RNA extract. RT-PCR thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 15 sec at 94\u00b0C, 45 sec at 55\u00b0C. In vitro transcribed RNAs for all viruses to be detected were used as a positive control except enterovirus and bocavirus for which known positive clinical samples previously confirmed by additional conventional PCR and monoplex RT-PCR were used.",

MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the patients10. Human coronavirus (HCOV)-positive patients (15 males, age 32-75 yr, median 60 yr) presented with symptoms of 1-3 days (median 2 days) duration, with no significant differences in the age distribution and the symptomatology between HCOV-positive and negative patients. Co-infections of HCOV with other respiratory viruses were seen in five patients (aged 38-75 yr, median 60 yr, 4 males). These included HCOV OC43+ adenovirus (n=1), HCOV 229E + adenovirus + influenza B (Victoria) (n=1), HCOV 229E + influenza A (H3N2) (n=1), HCOV 229E + adenovirus (n=1) and HCOV 229E + influenza A (H1N1pdm09) (n=1). Human rhinovirus (HRV) was detected in 20 patients, and there were no significant differences between age distribution, co-morbidities and clinical features of HRV-positive and negative patients.

Coronaviruses OC43 and 229E have been known to be associated with upper respiratory infection17. A systematic review of 31 studies showed that rhinoviruses were the most commonly isolated viruses from symptomatic patients during the Hajj (5.9-48.8% prevalence), followed by influenza viruses (4.5-13.9%) and coronaviruses (2.7-13.2%) with coronavirus 229E being the most common; other viruses were less frequently detected17. The high prevalence of viruses such as influenza A (H1N1pdm09), influenza A (H3N2), rhinoviruses, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1 and OC43) in the study participants was similar to other such studies17, however, the aetiopathogenetic contribution was not clear in the absence of assessing the asymptomatic carriage in a control group. The crowded conditions during pilgrimage likely facilitate transmission of these viruses and could contribute to the high frequency of respiratory illness, the most common symptoms among the pilgrims3. Our data showed that respiratory virus infections were common among returning pilgrims with influenza, with corona and rhinoviruses being the most frequent and that clinical symptoms were not helpful in differentiating among respiratory infections.",

            "text": "Pilgrimage acquired viral infections are important for public health because these do not follow the traditional seasonality of any geography. We have earlier demonstrated that influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses contribute significantly to acute exacerbations of COPD with a high level of activity during winter months in northern India, in a pattern that resembles the northern hemispherical pattern of circulation of influenza181920. However, since Hajj and Umrah are performed throughout the year with changing dates, the congregation of potentially infected individuals from all across the world with individual seasonality of circulation of these viruses makes the acquisition and transmission of the viruses possible. International gatherings have a potential of acquisition of communicable disease outbreaks and exportation of these pathogens and initiation of local chain of spread in home countries triggering local outbreaks. Although not reported in the context of Hajj, transmission of MERS-CoV has been reported in home countries after travelling to a MERS-CoV-affected country in several instances like in the UK21, France22, and South Korea9.",
