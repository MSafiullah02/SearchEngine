            "text": "In January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified multiple patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei, as cases of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) [1]. Common clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 include fever, fatigue and dry cough, occasionally accompanied by nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea [2,3]. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets or direct contact [[3], [4], [5]], and shows strong human-to-human transmissibility. COVID-19 was classified as a Class B infectious disease and should be implemented prevention and control measures applied to Class A infectious diseases [6,7]. As this epidemic broke around the Chinese New Year when population mobility is high, it resulted in a high risk that a large number of people may become virus carriers, which led to difficulties in identifying and controlling the source of infection. Therefore, the lack of effective prevention and control measures for nosocomial infections in crowded areas of general hospitals, such as outpatient clinics or wards, can easily give rise to nosocomial outbreaks. The hospital had clear standards for the protection and management of fever clinics and isolation wards, but there were no clear standards and procedures for the protection of non-isolated areas in hospitals. Refined management is both a management concept and a management method based on digitization, wherein information technology is professionally and systematically employed to achieve the goal of improving management efficiency and management quality [8,9]. To ensure the safety of patients and healthcare professionals, our hospital adopted refined management strategies for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections in non-isolated areas, and no hospital-acquired infections were found.",

Patients with an epidemiological history but without fever/respiratory/gastrointestinal symptoms went to designated clinics, and maintained a distance of at least 1 meter from each other. Medical equipment, such as stethoscopes, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, etc., was disinfected following each use. The surfaces of hospital beds, treatment tables and chairs, treatment carts, etc., and the floor were wiped and disinfected with 1000 mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant once every 4-hour. Visible contamination was disinfected and wiped immediately with 1000 mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant.
