An increase in SAA concentration is nonspecific, so does not indicate particular disease, but may prompt rapid therapy which is particularly important in the management of newborns. Sepsis is an important cause of mortality in the neonatal period. Signs of sepsis are nonspecific and may be subtle thus early detection poses a diagnostic challenge, but together with appropriate therapy is critical for case outcome 17, 24. Bacteraemia, septic arthritis and bacterial pneumonia produce high concentrations of SAA in foals 17, 24, 34, 35. In contrast, noninfectious causes of neonatal weakness have been characterised by normal to only slightly increased SAA concentrations 24, 34. Also foals with umbilical abscesses had low SAA concentration, which can be explained by the isolated character of inflammation. Thus, localised infection may be accompanied by normal SAA concentration. Increased SAA concentrations strongly suggest the possibility of systemic infection, but should never be interpreted as an indication for antimicrobial therapy. Detection of high SAA concentration warrants further investigation of infection, but the use of antimicrobials should be based on identification and susceptibility testing of the target pathogen(s) or, if this is not possible, should be based on epidemiological information and local knowledge of patterns of infection and antimicrobial susceptibility of the target bacteria. Clearly, national and regional antimicrobial policies should also be considered.",

SAA concentrations below 5 mg/L were reported in 15 of 54 (28%) pneumonic foals and in foals between 3 weeks and 5 months, and SAA has low sensitivity and specificity for detecting R. equi pneumonia 36. In the foals from R. equi endemic farms, SAA concentrations neither correlated with radiographic score and severity of pulmonary lesions nor ultrasonographic evidence of pneumonia, 36 and weekly testing SAA concentration was not an accurate marker of infection 37, 38. Reasons for failure to detect increased SAA concentrations in individuals with pneumonia and inflammation remain unknown but this may relate to the chronicity of disease 36.

A high (109 CFU) dose produced 10\u2010 to 100\u2010fold increases in both blood and endometrial SAA concentrations, while administration of a low (105 CFU) dose resulted only in an endometrial response, manifested as the increase in mRNA expression of SAA in endometrial tissue as early as 3 h post\u2010inoculation 9, 41. However, SAA concentration has failed as a marker of naturally occurring subclinical endometritis. In Icelandic mares with a history of infertility, SAA concentrations varied widely, in nine mares it reached very high concentrations (even 595.71 mg/L) but SAA concentrations were not associated with subclinical endometritis 40.",

In EED mares, more than 20\u2010fold increases in SAA concentration have been reported 42. Placentitis leads to abortion or the birth of premature and septic foals. In experimental models of placentitis, SAA concentrations rapidly increased and remained high until abortion 6, 27. In ascending placentitis, experimentally induced by intracervical inoculation with Streptococcus equi spp. Zooepidemicus, SAA concentration increased up to 100\u2010fold within 2\u20134 d.p.i. and abortion occurred within 5\u201325 days 27. In another experimental study, SAA concentration rose at a similar time post\u2010inoculation and vulvar discharge was the first clinical sign 6. In naturally occurring placentitis, the onset is usually more insidious and vaginal discharge is not usually the first sign 43. Thus, these experimental models may represent superacute inflammation 6. The amount of organisms inoculated is not standardised across studies 6, 27 and care must be taken in extrapolating observations made in experimental models to the naturally occurring condition. Possibly, if the process was not superacute but gradual, allowing for diagnosis and treatment before irreversible damage of placenta and the fetus, SAA may have increased prior to any clinical appearance 6. Measurement of SAA in fetal heart blood may also help in understanding the nature of abortion. Erol et al. reported that SAA concentrations in fetal blood were significantly higher, reaching from 10.5 to 40 mg/L in the presence of infectious and/or inflammatory process in feto\u2010placental tissues 44. However, low SAA concentration resulting from degradation may occur in fetuses that have died in utero a long time before the abortion due to chronic placentitis without a systemic infection. Therefore, measuring the concentrations of SAA may help to detect mares with placentitis and at risk for abortion. Moreover, the administration of antibiotics and anti\u2010inflammatory drugs in mares with placentitis successfully prevented the rise of SAA, thus, SAA concentration may also help in monitoring the treatment 6. However, again it is important to stress that antibiotics should be administrated only in confirmed infections and with microbiology advice. Thus, not all pregnant mares with increased blood SAA concentration need to be treated with antimicrobials, but rather high SAA concentration warrants further investigation of placentitis.",

Septic arthritis in adult horses occurs most commonly as a result of traumatic wounds and can become life threatening due to difficulties in clearing established infections and development of degenerative changes associated with ongoing inflammation. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and synovial fluid analysis (total protein and total nucleated cell count), however, these methods may not allow for clear differentiation between acute nonseptic inflammation and infection. Early diagnosis is critical for rapid elimination of infection and inflammation to avoid ongoing cartilage degradation and osteoarthritis 51, 52, 53. SAA can be measured in synovial fluid 4. Its concentrations are not affected by repeated arthrocenteses 15, 51, intra\u2010articular administration of amikacin 51 arthroscopic lavage 52 or through\u2010and\u2010through joint lavage in healthy joints 52. In healthy horses, SAA concentrations in both blood and synovial fluid are generally less than 1 mg/L 51. A rise in SAA concentration has been proposed as useful to differentiate between septic or nonseptic intrasynovial pathology, with a cut\u2010off value of 60.7 mg/L for septic condition 53. However, large\u2010scale clinical trials are lacking and in a small study involving five horses with experimentally induced septic arthritis, SAA in blood increased earlier (24 vs. 36 h) and was higher than in synovial fluid (111.9 \u00b1 116.3 vs. 27.3 \u00b1 40.1 mg/L) 10.

Pihl et al. 58 evaluated clinical and clinical plus blood test models for differentiating horses with inflammatory colic (enterocolitis and peritonitis) from those with colic requiring surgery. The clinical model included lethargy, rectal temperature >38\u00b0C, gastric reflux 5\u201310 L and normal rectal examination findings. All these variables were positive predictors of inflammatory colic except for gastric reflux of 5\u201310 L, which was a negative predictor. The ability of this model to correctly differentiate inflammatory from surgical colic was 86% as determined by area under the receiver\u2010operating characteristic curve. The clinical plus blood test model included also white blood cell counts, haematocrit, total plasma protein, lactate, SAA, haptoglobin and fibrinogen concentrations. With SAA included in the model no additional blood parameters improved the model, and the final area under the curve was 90%. Thus, SAA measurement improved the predictive model accuracy 58. Serial measurement of SAA at 48, 72 and 96 h after exploratory celiotomy has also been shown to help to determine risk of complications and guide post\u2010operative management 59. SAA concentration indicated the onset of an inflammatory response more sensitively than fibrinogen concentration. However, some strangulating conditions may progress very quickly and it may be more useful to measure SAA in peritoneal fluid, where it increases more rapidly in horses with strangulations than in horses with colic for other reasons 60.",

Because concentrations are low in healthy horses and rise quickly in response to inflammation, SAA is sensitive, reliable and early indicator of inflammation. SAA measurements may be helpful in the differentiation between bacterial and viral diseases, the former typically giving rise to marked increases in plasma SAA concentrations while latter is associated with mild or moderate increases. The accessibly of SAA is useful when early diagnosis and immediate and aggressive treatment is critical such as in neonatal sepsis. However, SAA responses are nonspecific and measuring SAA concentration in isolation is not a gold standard. SAA should be used in combination with other diagnostic tests and procedures and should not be used as the sole basis for prompting antimicrobial treatment. Serial measurement of SAA concentrations can be used to assess the effectiveness of responsibly chosen antimicrobial and other treatments and document improvement.",
