Most patients witnessed a history of visiting Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. On December 31, 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and Wuhan City health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown causes in Wuhan City [1,2]. On January 7, 2020, the China CDC identified a novel coronavirus from the lower respiratory tract samples of the patients with pneumonia and disclosed the genomic sequence on January 11 [3,4]. This novel coronavirus was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) named this infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2 identified in 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [5]. Despite the effort to stop the transmission of COVID-19, the infection spread throughout mainland China, and in January 2020, cases were reported in Thailand, Japan, and South Korea [6,7]. Within less than 3 months since the discovery of the unknown pathogen, the infection spread to at least 114 countries and caused more than 4,000 deaths. On March 11, the WHO announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic [8]. In South Korea, the first case was identified on January 20, 2020 [7], and as of March 26, a total of 9,241 confirmed cases leading to 131 deaths (1.42% fatality rate) has been reported [9].",

In South Korea, the first suspected case was reported in April 3, 2003. As of June 15, 2003, three probable cases and 17 suspected cases were identified without any fatality [12]. Globally, no SARS-CoV infection has been reported since 2004 [10]. In 2012, another novel coronavirus was first identified in a patient with acute severe respiratory syndrome and multiple organ failure in Saudi Arabia [13]. This pathogen, later named MERS-CoV, associated with pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome (Middle East respiratory syndrome), leading to an outbreak in Arabian Peninsula. Between April 2012 and December 2019, a total of 2,502 confirmed cases and 861 deaths (34.4% fatality rate) were reported in 27 countries [14]. In May 2015, a returned traveler from Saudi Arabia was linked to 186 confirmed MERS-CoV infections and 38 deaths (20.4% fatality rate) in South Korea [15].",

This subfamily divides into 4 genera \u2013 alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. So far, 6 coronaviruses are known to cause human diseases. Four coronaviruses are endemic in humans. These are human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1. Two epidemic human corona viruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Alphacoronavirus includes HCoV 229E and NL63, and betacoronavirus includes HCoV OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. The gammacoronavirus includes avian infectious bronchitis virus and several other coronaviruses, and deltacoronavirus includes several re cently discovered avian coronavirus.",

Possibility of aerosol transmission remains to be investigated. MERS-CoV spreads mostly through droplet and direct contact, but transmission through indirect contact, aerosol, fecal-to-oral route is also possible [10,16]. SARS-CoV primarily spreads via droplet and direct contact. Medical procedures that induce production of aerosol, such as nebulizer treatment or intubation, are reported to increase the risk of transmission. Fecal-to-oral route may be possible, but little evidence supports it [10]. SARS-CoV-2 seems to share the mode of transmission with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as it spreads mainly through respiratory secretion or droplet. Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable on various surfaces such as stainless steel, plastic, glass, and cardboard at least several hours [32,33]. This indicates that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through contaminated surfaces might be possible. Aerosol is currently not considered as primary mode of transmission since no airborne transmission has been reported yet, although it seems possible in hospital settings where aerosol-producing procedures occur. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool, whole blood and urine of COVID-19 patients, but whether transmission via such medium is possible is still unknown [29].",

SARS-CoV was effectively contained by isolating the patient soon after the onset of illness, since secondary attack rate was greatly reduced by isolating the index case within 5 days. On the other hand, the point of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. In general, respiratory viruses have the highest transmissibility when the patient has symptoms, therefore we assume the same for COVID-19. According to a study that followed respiratory viral load of 18 COVID-19 pati ents in China, viral load peaks shortly after the onset of illness and declines there on [36]. The viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza virus. The study results suggested that transmission of COVID-19 may occur during first few days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, the number of virus RNA copies from one asymptomatic case was comparable to that of the rest of symptomatic cases. In addition, a case of transmission from an asymptomatic family member was recently reported [37]. Therefore, we can assume that transmission of COVID-19 may occur with the illness onset and even with mild or no symptoms. However, further research is needed on viral transmission from an asymptomatic patient because there is a possibility that the patient may not have been aware of his or her symptoms or may not have been recognized by caregivers due to old age or underlying illness of the patient. The pattern of transmission observed in COVID-19 is distinctive from that of SARS-CoV; such pattern indicates that the spread may not be effectively controlled by isolating the patient after the illness onset. Transmissibility of the virus during incubation period is yet to be established.",

Five mothers delivered; 4 by caesarean section and 1 by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Gestational ages ranged 26\u201337 weeks. All 5 newborns did not show evidence of SARS-CoV infection, but 2 newborns out of 5 had intrauterine growth retardation. Another study analyzed several reports about pregnancy and perinatal outcome of MERS-CoV infected pregnant women [39]); of the total 9, 5 mothers received intensive care, and 3 out of 5 them died (33.3% case fatality rate). Two women had spontaneous miscarriage, and 5 mothers delivered at gestational age between 32 to term; none of the newborns had signs of MERS-CoV infection. Chen et al. [40] analyzed 9 pregnant women who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in their third trimester and had caesarean section. Clinical features of mothers and their newborns were recorded, along with SARS-CoV-2 detection in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breastmilk, and nasopharyngeal swab of the newborn. None of the 9 mothers developed severe pneumonia, died or had miscarriage. All the amniotic fluid, cord blood, breastmilk, and nasopharyngeal swab of the newborn tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. This study suggested that there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in women who developed pneumonia during 3rd trimester of pregnancy. However, the number of pregnant women of the study is very small and only the infection in the late of pregnancy is included, so it cannot be concluded at the moment on the impact of the infection especially in the early or mid-term pregnancy on pregnant women and fetuses.",
