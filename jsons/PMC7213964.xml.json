In view of the hypercoagulable state of patients with severe COVID-19, and the potential increased risk of thrombosis, we suggest that all patients with COVID-19 that are admitted to hospital should receive this prophylactic treatment in the absence of medical contraindications. If LMWH is not available, unfractionated heparin could be used, although this requires more frequent injections; an alternative is fondaparinux, but whether this drug has the postulated anti-inflammatory benefits of heparin is unclear. Patients with severe COVID-19 might need higher-dose thromboprophylaxis than is generally given because of their hypercoagulable state, and this hypothesis will be tested in several multicentre, randomised, controlled trials (NCT04372589, NCT04367831, NCT04345848, and NCT04366960).PanelManagement of coagulopathy in patients with severe COVID-19\nDiagnostic approach\n\n\u2022Repeated (every 2\u20133 days) assessment of:\n\u2022D-dimer\u2022Prothrombin time\u2022Platelet counts\n\n\nTherapeutic management\n\n\u2022Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for all patients hospitalised\u2022Consider venous thromboembolism in patients with rapid respiratory deterioration and high D-dimer concentrations\n\u2022Do CT angiography or ultrasound of the venous system of the lower extremities\u2022If diagnostic testing is not possible and there are no bleeding risk factors, consider therapeutic anticoagulation\n\u2022Other interventions (such as plasma exchange, or administration of other anticoagulants or anti-inflammatory drugs) are experimental and should be considered in a clinical trial setting only\n",

This diagnosis should be confirmed by imaging, although in some very unstable patients this might be difficult. Alternatively, venous ultrasound of the legs can be helpful to identify lower extremity thrombosis. In patients with a strong suspicion of pulmonary embolism in whom no objective diagnosis can be obtained, therapeutic anticoagulation could be started, particularly in the absence of risk factors for bleeding or other contraindications for anticoagulation. Of note, the incidence of haemorrhagic complications in patients with COVID-19, even those with severe coagulopathy, appear to be low.4\n",
