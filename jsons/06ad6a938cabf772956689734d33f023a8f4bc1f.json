In the hour of crisis, the only preventive measures were strict quarantine; hygiene maintenance with regular handwashing; covering mouth, nose, eyes, and ears; risk screening at airports and railways 1 ; and social distancing. A strategy was proposed after the advent of a virus-specific molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test called \"mass screening\" that involved testing nasal and throat swabs from the random population to assess viral spread and to isolate those infected from the healthy population. 2 The strategy gained widespread approval in developed countries, and huge random populations were screened. However, the cost of testing was an obstacle for developing nations; governments intended to adopt this strategy but could not due to the overwhelming expense.",

However, India has some of the largest slum areas in the world, where 10-20 people reside per 27.9 m 2 (~300 square feet), producing a very high risk of spread. Hence, if 1 person from the slum gets tested, there is a high probability that the test results reflect the status of those nearby. Rather than testing the whole slum, 1 person from every hut in each slum could be tested. This approach would reduce the number of tests and help to end the lockdowns within 4-5 days.",
