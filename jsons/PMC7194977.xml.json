These two steps are mediated by the coronavirus spike (S) protein. In addition to mediating entry, the S protein is the principal antigenic determinant and the target of neutralizing antibodies (Walls et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2004). This makes the S protein a valuable target in vaccine and antiviral efforts, as summarized in (Du et al., 2017, 2009; Xia et al., 2014). As the urgency to develop effective therapeutics against coronaviruses rises, it is important to also consider broad-spectrum properties of such therapies, as there will likely be future outbreaks for which we will need to be prepared for a rapid response.",

However, across the coronavirus family, the receptor binding domain is poorly conserved (Belouzard et al., 2012; Graham et al., 2013; Li, 2015), and so therapeutics that target the receptor binding function have low potential as a pan-coronavirus solution. In fact, it was observed that monoclonal antibodies that recognized the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain did not recognize the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, highlighting the low cross-reactivity in this region (Wrapp et al., 2020). On the other hand, the membrane fusion domain is amongst the most conserved areas in the S protein (Lai et al., 2017; Madu et al., 2009b), and so, targeting membrane fusion may have greater cross-functional success against future coronavirus outbreaks (Xia et al., 2019).",

These roles emphasize the importance of this protein in both viral entry and interaction with the host's immune system. The S protein is one of 4 structural proteins encoded by the CoV single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. In the viral membrane, the S protein participates in two key events: binding to the cellular receptor and inducing fusion between the viral and the cellular membranes (Belouzard et al., 2012). The accomplishment of these two events will drive the release of the viral RNA genome in the host cell and the subsequent start of the viral replication cycle (Masters and Perlman, 2013).",

The subgenomic RNAs encode four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), along with several accessory proteins. Upon translation, the S, E, and M structural proteins are inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, the proteins travel along the secretory pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the site of CoV particle assembly. Afterwards, the virus is released from the cell via exocytosis (de Haan and Rottier, 2005).",

The amino acid differences in the RBM (~50% sequence homology) across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been hypothesized to strengthen or weaken RBM-ACE2 associations, though it is unclear if the overall effect of all these differences results in stronger recognition of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 (Yan et al., 2020). It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 S does bind ACE2 with 10- to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S binding to ACE2 (Wrapp et al., 2020). However, another study reported that purified SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD binds ACE2 with similar affinities (Walls et al., 2020), so further experiments should be conducted to determine the impact of residue changes on ACE2 binding.",

The well-conserved nature of DPP4 across a wide variety of species (e.g. bats, dromedaries, humans) provides more insight into the zoonotic capabilities of MERS-CoV. Although MERS-CoV does not infect murine cells since MERS-CoV S does not bind to mouse DPP4, it is possible to infect mice by replacing blades 4 & 5 of mouse DPP4 with blades from animals susceptible to MERS-CoV S binding, forming chimeric DPP4s (Barlan et al., 2014). With the ability to interchange blades 4 & 5, it was determined that MERS-CoV S preferentially binds to human, horse, camel, goat, and bat DPP4, listed in decreasing order (Barlan et al., 2014). Another contributing factor to the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV comes from reports that MERS-CoV S has the ability to bind sialic acid receptors in addition to DPP4 (Li et al., 2017). Recent work further revealed that sialic acid receptors play a role in transmissibility between species, as they reaffirmed the binding affinity reported by the Barlan group (Widagdo et al., 2019).",

Within this class, the fusion subunit is largely composed of \u03b1-helical secondary structures (Fig. 2), and its function is regulated through proteolytical priming or cleavage at specific sites to induce the fusion-competent state of the S protein (White and Whittaker, 2016). The S2 or fusion subunit contains a variety of motifs (Fig. 1C), starting with the fusion peptide (FP) which is the functional fusogenic element of the S protein. The FP describes a short segment (15\u201325 amino acids), conserved across the viral family that is composed of mostly hydrophobic residues, such as glycine (G) or alanine (A), which inserts in the host cell membrane to trigger the fusion event (Epand, 2003). Fusion peptides tend to be sensitive to point mutations, in that a single mutation can negate fusion (Madu et al., 2009b). However, the fusion peptide is loosely defined, as these requirements are not absolute but rather serve as guidelines to identify the fusion peptide region.",

Further work identified regions 873\u2013888 and 1185\u20131202 as strong membrane interacting regions and proposed that these regions, in conjunction with 770\u2013788, work synergistically to mediate fusion (Guill\u00e9n et al., 2008a, 2008b). Separately, the region 798\u2013835 was also identified as a fusion peptide, since single point mutagenesis studies demonstrated its importance in fusion, with an extremely conserved region, SFIEDLLFNKV (798\u2013808) (Madu et al., 2009b, 2009a).

            "text": "An early indication that SARS-CoV can utilize the plasma membrane pathway came from cell-cell fusion studies that found that HEK293T cells transiently expressing the SARS-CoV S protein mediated cell-cell fusion with target Vero E6 cells when treated with a low concentration of trypsin, whereas a similar setup utilizing a low pH pulse in the absence of trypsin did not mediate any fusion (Simmons et al., 2004). Likewise, trypsin was also found to induce MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein mediated cell-cell fusion of Vero E6 cells and 293T cells, respectively (Ou et al., 2020; Shirato et al., 2013). Subsequent studies using retroviral pseudoparticles expressing SARS-CoV S protein (SARSpp) or MERS-CoV S protein (MERSpp) revealed that trypsin treatment of these pseudoparticles after binding to their respective receptor resulted in effective infection at the plasma membrane surface (Qian et al., 2013; Simmons et al., 2005). In fact, pretreating the S protein prior to receptor binding was found to abrogate infection, and this is hypothesized to occur because trypsin treatment causes the S protein to undergo irreversible conformational changes so that it cannot mediate fusion (Matsuyama et al., 2005; Park et al., 2016; Simmons et al., 2005). This phenomenon has yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. Another comprehensive study investigating the impact of a panel of additional exogenous proteases on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV live virus infection of Vero E6 cells revealed that thermolysin and elastase also efficiently mediate cellular entry at the plasma membrane after binding (Belouzard et al., 2010; Matsuyama et al., 2005; Shirato et al., 2013). The finding that elastase could mediate entry is clinically important, since elastase is produced by inflammatory cells in the lungs during SARS-CoV infection and could thus promote the progression of SARS-CoV infection.",

This is because coronaviruses should only be cleaved after receptor engagement and not before, but this timing would be difficult to control if exogenous proteases were the in vivo activator. Thus, transmembrane proteases are of interest as they are localized on the plasma membrane surface where the virus encounters the receptor. The type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) are a family of such proteases anchored in the cellular membrane and have already been implicated in influenza virus infection (Choi et al., 2009). In particular, the transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2) and TMPRSS4 were found to activate and enable influenza virus spread, even in the absence of extracellular trypsin (Bertram et al., 2010; B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2006; Chaipan et al., 2009).",

An initial study demonstrated that a soluble form of a TTSP protease, TMPRSS11a, could cleave and activate SARS-CoV S protein for fusion (Kam et al., 2009). Subsequent studies investigated whether membrane-bound TTSP proteases were capable of activating the SARS-CoV S protein also. It was determined that cell lines transiently expressing TMPRSS2 support both SARSpp and live SARS-CoV infection at the plasma membrane without exogeneous or late-pathway proteases (Glowacka et al., 2011; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Shulla et al., 2011). Similar studies with MERSpp and live MERS-CoV also identified membrane-bound TMPRSS2 as an activator of MERS-CoV infection (Gierer et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2013; Shirato et al., 2013). SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles (SARS2pp) and live SARS-CoV-2 also utilize membrane-bound TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Matsuyama et al., 2020), much like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

Utilizing MERSpp, it was shown that TMPRSS11a and TMPRSS11e can also activate MERS-CoV S for viral infection (Zmora et al., 2018). However, the TTSP family is not a blanket activator of coronavirus S mediated fusion. Although TMPRSS4 was found to activate SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S mediated cell-cell fusion, it was ineffective in promoting viral infection (Glowacka et al., 2011; Qian et al., 2013). Transient expression of TMPRSS2, 4, 11a, 11d, and 11e were shown to enhance SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion, though it is unknown if these proteases activate S for infection (Ou et al., 2020). The discrepancies in these findings could result from high S expression and/or interaction of large surface areas in cell-cell fusion assays that encourage more fusion than would be possible in viral-cell fusion (Glowacka et al., 2011). More intriguingly, TTSP activation can also differ between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. TMPRSS11d, also known as human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), is unable to activate SARS-CoV S infection, but can activate MERS-CoV S infection (Bertram et al., 2011; Zmora et al., 2018). While differences between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV activation will be further discussed in the following paragraph, it is noteworthy to mention that the coronavirus S has evolved to have flexibility in a variety of proteases that can cleave and activate it, providing a possible rationale for their zoonotic potential.",

            "text": "Although a high degree of sequence conservation exists between the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S2 membrane fusion domains, there are key differences in their fusion mechanism for plasma membrane entry. For one, MERS-CoV S contains a furin cleavage site at S1/S2, whereas SARS-CoV S does not (Fig. 1D) (Millet and Whittaker, 2014). Furin or furin-like proteases found in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) can encounter and act on such cleavage sites in coronavirus S as it is being synthesized (Millet and Whittaker, 2015). MERS-CoV has been observed to be cleaved during biosynthesis at the S1/S2 position (Millet and Whittaker, 2014), and this pre-cleavage was shown to promote subsequent MERS-CoV cleavage by TMPRSS2 at the S2\u2032 position to activate plasma membrane fusion, whereas if there was no pre-cleavage, immediate entry via TMPRSS2 was not observed (Park et al., 2016). Furin activation of MERS-CoV at the S2\u2032 position for entry has also been observed, based on the presence of specific basic residues (Millet and Whittaker, 2014), but the exact role is still unclear (Matsuyama et al., 2018). There are no indications that SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S can be cleaved by furin at S2\u2019.",

Indeed, it is observed that SARS-CoV S binds its receptor with a 10- to 20- fold higher affinity compared to that of MERS-CoV S with its receptor, so stronger receptor binding can perhaps compensate for uncleaved S1/S2, at least in the case for SARS-CoV to support plasma membrane entry. It has been suggested that the S1/S2 site may enable these coronaviruses to spread and infect new organisms with low receptor affinity. Interestingly, TMPRSS2 overexpression was observed to allow uncleaved MERS-CoV to infect cells, bypassing the required S1/S2 cleavage event (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018), once again highlighting the adaptability of the coronavirus S protein.",

A caveat is that if MERS-CoV is not pre-cleaved at the S1/S2 site during biosynthesis, then it will also be endocytosed, regardless of the presence of plasma membrane proteases (Park et al., 2016). As the virus is shuttled along the endocytic pathway towards the cell interior, the pH in the endosome decreases. For some viruses (e.g. influenza, vesicular stomatitis virus), the presence of low pH triggers fusion. As such, treating the cells with lysosomotropic agents to prevent endosomal acidification abrogates infection of these pH-dependent viruses (Ochiai et al., 1995). Initial experiments infecting Vero E6 cells with SARSpp in the presence of lysosomotropic agents suggested that SARSpp was sensitive to low pH conditions (Simmons et al., 2004). However, since a pH pulse could not mediate cell-cell fusion and SARSpp exposure to low pH prior to binding did not reduce infectivity, there were grounds to suspect other factors may be involved in CoV endosomal fusion.",

            "text": "The low pH environment also activates endosomal proteases, such as cathepsins, a family of cysteine proteases. Of interest are cathepsin B and cathepsin L, which become active in the early and late endosome, respectively, and are known activators of other members in the CoV family (Qiu et al., 2006; Regan et al., 2008). Indeed, subsequent studies demonstrated that the cathepsin B/L inhibitor MDL28170 drastically reduced SARSpp (Huang et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) and MERS-CoV entry into MRC-5 cells (Gierer et al., 2013). Studies on SARS-CoV-2 have echoed similar themes; SARS2pp are sensitive to cathepsin B/L inhibitors (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020). Confirmation that all these coronaviruses are activated by cathepsin L for fusion in the late endosome was determined using inhibitors specific for either cathepsin B or L (Ou et al., 2020; Qian et al., 2013; Simmons et al., 2005), along with direct observation of SARS-CoV trafficking to late endosomes (Mingo et al., 2015). Thus, it is believed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 dependency on low pH in the endosomal route is indirect; acidic conditions are required to activate cathepsin L protease, which in turn then act on S, resulting in a virus primed to undergo subsequent fusion steps. To further confirm the independence of these coronaviruses entry from pH, it is important to reiterate that both viruses can undergo plasma membrane fusion, setting a precedence for neutral pH fusion.",

In the case of influenza virus, low-pathogenicity influenza strains contain a single basic residue cleavage site, whereas highly pathogenic influenza strains have a polybasic furin cleavage site (Sun et al., 2010). It has been suggested that the presence of furin cleavage sites in influenza HA expands viral tropism, as furin and furin-like proteases are ubiquitously expressed in most cell lines. Thus, it has been hypothesized that the additional furin site present at S1/S2 may also allow SARS-CoV-2 to spread more efficiently than other SARS-like-CoVs (Coutard et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020), though experimental work will need to be done to show whether this is the case. Of interest is to also determine how SARS-CoV-2 acquired this cleavage site, whether from animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission (Andersen et al., 2020), in order to determine the pathogenicity of emerging coronaviruses.",

For SARS-CoV, trypsin shows elements of a two-step activation process; it first cleaves arginine at the SARS-CoV S1/S2 site (R667), followed by the S2\u2032 site (R797) for fusion (Belouzard et al., 2009), whereas TMPRSS2 does not require the S1/S2 cleavage site. This aspect highlights the flexibility of the CoV FP as it can be cleaved by different proteases resulting in slightly different activities. As further evidence of CoV FP flexibility, elastase cleaves SARS-CoV S at the S2\u2032 site at T795 (Belouzard et al., 2010), which is two residues upstream of the trypsin cleavage site at R797, suggesting that the S protein can even accommodate cleavages at different sites. However, mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that elastase mediates maximal fusion when cleaving at the 797 site, showing that while the S protein is flexible in cleavage location, it has preferred sites. For MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the exact sites at S1/S2 and S2\u2019 position for exogeneous protease cleavage have yet to be determined and it would be interesting to observe if small variations in the sites exist across different proteases in these cases as well.",

For MERS-CoV, functional studies have shown that S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites are dispensable, though cathepsin L activation of MERS-CoV is slightly reduced when the S2\u2032 is mutated (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018). This seems to indicate that cathepsin L may be using auxiliary S1/S2 and/or S2\u2019 sites for activation. It is difficult to screen for these sites since cathepsin has a relatively indiscriminate recognition motif, though studies have shown that cathepsin L prefers aromatic residues at the P2 location (Biniossek et al., 2011). While it seems that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit similar behavior when entering via the endocytic route, it is important to emphasize that the cathepsin L cleavage sites are unknown and it is possible that the location or the number of sites vary and could in turn, impact entry efficiency of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 endocytic route. All in all, the extensive range of proteases that activate SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 attest to their promiscuity in infecting a wide range of cell types that present these proteases and may explain the expanded tropism of these viruses.",

If membrane-bound proteases, most notably TMPRSS2, are available on the host cell, they can cleave both viruses for early fusion at the plasma membrane surface after receptor binding. As noted, MERS-CoV also requires the S1/S2 cleavage during biosynthesis for plasma membrane fusion (this has yet to be determined for SARS-CoV-2). Otherwise, the virus is endocytosed and the increasingly acidic conditions can activate cathepsin L to trigger fusion at the endosomal membrane. Table 2\nsummarizes cell lines susceptible to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, as well as their infection pathways. Initial studies of SARS-CoV-2-susceptible cell lines can be found in (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020).

This view is further supported by observations that SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, was found to colocalize with TMPRSS2 so that after receptor binding, SARS-CoV can immediately be processed by TMPRSS2 for entry (Shulla et al., 2011).

Using Calu-3 cells, researchers have shown that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection are mitigated using a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat, but not with a cathepsin inhibitor, EST (Kawase et al., 2012; Shirato et al., 2013). This implies that TMPRSS2-mediated entry is the preferred pathway, since cathepsin inhibitors have minimal impact on entry when the TMPRSS2 route is available. In fact, mice treated with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor had a higher survival rate (60%) than mice treated with a cathepsin inhibitor (10%) when challenged with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2015). Similar studies also allude to the importance of TMPRSS2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection as camostat significantly reduced both SARS2pp and live SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Interestingly, treatment of Calu-3 cells with both camostat and EST drastically reduced SARS-CoV, but not MERS-CoV infection, much more so than with camostat alone (Kawase et al., 2012; Shirato et al., 2013). This suggests that SARS-CoV can more easily employ the late pathway than MERS-CoV.",

Intriguingly, usage of non-lung cell culture lines that support SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, such as Vero E6 (SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2) or Huh-7 (MERS-CoV) have demonstrated that the cathepsin L pathway is much more prominent as these cells express minimal TMPRSS2 and infection is strongly reduced in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Park et al., 2016; Simmons et al., 2005).

In both of them, sphingolipids and cholesterol molecules tend to pack together and form microdomains termed \u201clipid rafts\u201d floating within the \"sea\" of phospholipids (Simons and Ikonen, 1997). Sphingolipids possess long, saturated acyl chains that have reduced Van der Waals interactions with the unsaturated acyl chains of phospholipids in membranes, due to the inability to align the unsaturated carbon chains. Cholesterol can fill gaps between associating sphingolipids, leading to tighter packing and ordering of cholesterol and sphingolipids that gives lipids rafts detergent-resistance above their non-raft counterparts. The high lipid tail ordering in rafts also influences the distribution of protein and other lipids (Munro, 2003). As an example, GPI-anchored or palmitoylated proteins tend to be raft-associated (Levental et al., 2010) and sphingolipids like GM1 tend to also be enriched in lipid rafts.",

For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), membrane fusion requires multiple fusion protein and receptor interactions, and rafts have been proposed as a means to enrich fusion proteins and receptors for viral entry. Biophysical studies have shown HIV fusion protein interactions with raft domain lipids (Hammache et al., 1999). In vitro studies treating HIV particles with a cholesterol sequestering drug, \u03b2-cyclodextrin, was shown to inactivate the virus by rendering it incapable of membrane fusion (Liao et al., 2001), highlighting a potential fusion inhibition strategy.",

Earlier studies showed that ACE2 was found in non-raft fractions in CHO cells transiently expressing it and Vero E6 cells endogenously expressing it (Li et al., 2007; Warner et al., 2005). Other studies have observed that ACE2 colocalizes with established raft proteins caveolin-1, flotillin-2, and ganglioside GM1 in Vero E6 cells (Glende et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2008), with the discrepancies between these results attributed to different experimental techniques (Glende et al., 2008). For the study with transiently expressed ACE2 in CHO cells, overexpression could cause ACE2 to also partition into non-raft areas. For the studies with Vero E6 cells, endogenous expression of ACE2 and its distribution depend on the time point following cell seeding and it is possible that the different groups might have measured ACE2 location at different time points. Further studies on the influence of cholesterol on SARS-CoV infectivity have strengthened the notion that ACE2 is a raft protein (Glende et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2008). Treating Vero cells with a cholesterol-chelating drug, methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (m\u03b2CD) that disrupts raft formation, has shown that SARS-CoV can still infect in the absence of lipid rafts. It was observed that SARSpp infection was inhibited 60\u201390% in cells following m\u03b2CD treatment. A possible explanation is that ACE2 is a raft protein. By disrupting raft formation, ACE2 is no longer concentrated in microdomains, and this reduced receptor availability lessens SARS-CoV docking and binding efficiency. It will be of interest to observe if SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is similarly inhibited by this drug treatment.",

With regard to MERS-CoV, its DPP4 receptor has been reported to partition into the raft fraction, in Jurkat cells, a human T cell line (Ishii et al., 2001). It would be interesting to observe if DPP4 also partitions into the raft phase in MERS-CoV susceptible cell lines and to determine the dependence of MERS-CoV entry on cholesterol.",

Initial studies have discovered that the rubella virus fusion machinery coordinates with calcium ions (Ca2+) for proper orientation and insertion into the host membrane (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2014). This coordination/requirement was specific to Ca2+ as both fusion assays and infectivity experiments demonstrated that magnesium, manganese, and zinc cations did not enable fusion when supplemented at the same concentration as Ca2+ for rubella virus. Later it was shown by (Nathan et al., 2019) that the Ebola virus fusion machinery also coordinates with Ca2+ in entry, further corroborated by (Das et al., 2020).",

By employing extracellular and/or intracellular calcium chelating compounds, it is possible to infect cells in Ca2+ depleted conditions and probe resulting infectivity (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2016). Infectivity assays with SARSpp and MERSpp demonstrated that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV entry into Vero e6 and Huh7 cell lines was reduced when intracellular calcium was chelated (Lai et al., 2017; Straus et al., 2019). These results suggest that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV entry into cells using the endocytic route has aspects of calcium dependence. Ca2+ interactions crucial for CoV entry were further explored with biophysical techniques. Using electron spin resonance (ESR), it was observed that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP induces the ordering of the lipid acyl chains upon interaction, termed membrane ordering. Increased membrane ordering aids fusion by increasing the negative curvature of the bilayer as it bends during the fusion process, which will reduce the repulsive energy between two opposing membranes (Ge and Freed, 2009). In the presence of Ca2+, the FPs are able to induce greater membrane ordering, indicating that Ca2+ may promote fusion by stabilizing a structure of the FP that organizes the lipids in a manner that facilities membrane merging.",

This aspect was manifested in infectivity experiments showing that SARSpp infection was reduced more compared to MERSpp infection when Ca2+ was chelated. Further evidence highlighting the differences between these CoVs comes from isothermal calorimetry titration (ITC) experiments demonstrating that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+ ion, whereas the SARS-CoV FP binds two. After partitioning the SARS-CoV FP domain into two separate domains, FP1 and FP2, it was determined using ESR experiments that each of these domains induces greater membrane order in the presence of Ca2+, suggesting that SARS-CoV FP binds Ca2+ in both the FP1 and FP2 domain. In contrast, mutagenesis experiments conducted on the MERS-CoV FP suggested only one negatively-charged amino acid (E891) in the FP1 region that could bind Ca2+. Although these experiments suggest that MERS-CoV FP can only bind one Ca2+ in its FP1 region, while SARS-CoV FP can bind two, one in each of its FP1 and FP2 regions, further experiments should be conducted to complete this data set. ESR experiments should verify that only the MERS-CoV FP1, not FP2, has a membrane-ordering effect dependent on Ca2+ and mutagenesis experiments should find sites in the SARS-CoV FP1 and FP2 domain that bind Ca2+. Regardless, it is remarkable that despite exhibiting such high sequence conservation, there are subtle differences between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV entry requirements.",

This packing is driven by hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and HR2 and forms the viral fusion core, also known as the six-helix bundle.

Shortly after the SARS outbreak in 2003, three independent groups designed peptides based on the SARS-CoV HR2 region and found that they were inhibitory (Bosch et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2004). Circular-dichroism (CD), a technique that reports on the structural and disordered content of a peptide, showed that HR2 peptides bound to viral HR1 regions have more alpha-helical content than only HR2, suggesting that HR2 peptides form a stable structure when bound to HR1 (Bosch et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004). These results demonstrate that HR2 peptides can compete with the virus fusion protein's own HR2 region to bind HR1 and prevent fusion. A similar tale can be told for MERS-CoV HR2-based peptides. Two groups investigated MERS-CoV fusion core formation and found that an analogous HR2 peptide inhibited infection (Gao et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014). CD experiments proved that the HR2 peptide bound to HR1, suggesting that the inhibition mechanism is identical to that of SARS-CoV HR2 and HIV HR2 peptides (Lu et al., 2014).",

Crystal structures of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV fusion cores showed that residue differences in the HR1 and HR2 region enabled MERS-CoV to form more hydrogen bonds in the fusion core, suggesting that MERS-CoV HR2 peptides have a greater binding affinity for the HR1 region compared with SARS-CoV HR2 peptides. Another explanation focuses on the differences in the fusion pathways between the two viruses. In the cell lines used, MERS-CoV is hypothesized to infect via the plasma membrane route, whereas SARS-CoV infects via the endosomal route. Since the peptides are likely more available in the extracellular space than in an endosome, this could explain why MERS-CoV is more sensitive to HR2 inhibitors. In fact, one study observed that the SARS-CoV HR2 peptide did block SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells more potently when trypsin treatment caused SARS-CoV to utilize the plasma membrane pathway, rather than the endosomal pathway (Ujike et al., 2008). To be more conclusive, it would be important to study the efficacy of these peptides in inhibiting infection of lung-derived cell lines, such as Calu-3, since they could more accurately recapitulate in vivo infection. This would also shed light on the viral entry pathway that these peptides inhibit and how efficient they block viral entry at the plasma membrane pathway versus the endosomal pathway.",

Recently, one group challenged this notion and screened HR2-derived peptides from all human-infecting CoV (HCoV), including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 (OC43), and HCoV-HKU1 (Xia et al., 2019). They found that the HR2 peptide from HCoV-OC43 inhibited all these aforementioned CoVs. The unique pan inhibition property can be attributed to key amino acid differences that strengthen HR1-HR2 interactions. As an example, the crystal structures of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV HR1 interaction with the OC43 HR2 peptide showed that the OC43 HR2 peptide has a valine that fits neatly into the hydrophobic pockets of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV HR1. The corresponding SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV HR2 residues, alanine and threonine, fit the pocket loosely, or not at all. This study also found that the OC43 peptide inhibits SARS-like CoV, which have reservoir in bats and recognize human receptors (Ge et al., 2013; Menachery et al., 2016). This suggests that the OC43 peptide exhibits promise as a treatment during coronavirus outbreaks.",

Strategies aimed at improving IC50 and pharmacokinetic values have included introducing mutations or adding conjugates. It has been previously reported that introducing negatively and positively charged amino acids Glu (E) and Lys (K) with three or four residues in between them can form E-K or K-E salt bridges that enhance the peptide's stability, solubility, and antiviral activity (Lu et al., 2014; Marqusee and Baldwin, 1987; Otaka et al., 2002). Combining these mutations with others not involved in HR1 binding on the OC43 HR2 peptide resulted in decreased IC50 and increased solubility values. This mutated peptide, named EK1, was found to be more inhibitory than the native HR2 peptide for SARS-CoV (IC50 values of 2.23 and 2.81, respectively) and MERS-CoV (IC50 values of 0.26 and 1.06, respectively) pseudovirus infection. EK1 was also evaluated for its ability to protect mice against live MERS-CoV challenge. Infection was uniformly lethal for untreated mice, while those treated either prophylactically or therapeutically had 100% and 75% survival, respectively (Xia et al., 2019). Most promisingly, EK1 also significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle infection, though slightly less potent than its native HR2 peptide (IC50 values of 2.38 and 0.98, respectively) (Xia et al., 2020). Regardless, these results highlight fusion inhibitory compounds as a promising strategy to block coronavirus infections.",

This showed potent synergism in blocking both receptor binding and membrane fusion by inhibiting MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion as well as MERSpp infection (Wang et al., 2019). Furthermore, since CoV receptors and proteases tend to partition in lipid-enriched domains, another group tested the possibility of directing HR2 peptides towards these lipid-enriched domains where CoV entry occurs. Conjugating palmitate, which partitions into lipid rafts, to HR2P-M2 was found to increase inhibition of SARSpp and MERSpp cell entry (Park and Gallagher, 2017). On the other hand, conjugating tocopherol, which partitions into non-raft domains, to HR2P-M2 had minimal impact on cell entry. An intriguing aspect of this work is that these palmitate-conjugated peptides also strongly inhibited CoV entry via the endosomal route, which is believed to be relatively resistant to the inhibitory action of these peptides. Indeed, immunofluorescence microscopy showed that lipid-tagged peptides were detected intracellularly, whereas non-lipid-tagged peptides were not detected on cells.",

Peptide stapling is one technique, which generates a \"brace\" that locks a specific conformation for the peptide, resulting in increased target affinity, cell permeability, and serum stability (Frank et al., 2014; Hojo et al., 2016). For HR2 peptides, peptide stapling can stabilize the \u03b1-helical nature of the peptide, which is critical to their potency. An all-hydrocarbon peptide stapling of HR2P-M2, named P21S10, resulted in a 27-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve value, which measures the total systemic exposure to a drug, while maintaining a similar EC50 and in vivo half-life when compared to HR2P-M2 (Wang et al., 2018). An alternative strategy includes conjugating peptides to gold nanorods. Nanorods have emerged as a promising drug delivery system for improving pharmacokinetic values. One group conjugated HR2-based peptides to a gold nanorod with a polyethylene glycol coating (PIH-AuNR), which demonstrated a 10-fold inhibition increase of MERS-CoV S mediated cell-cell fusion and longer inhibitory activity over its non-conjugated counterpart. In vivo studies demonstrated that PIH-AuNR are biocompatible with mice; over 12 days, there were no significant differences in body weight and behavioral abnormalities between PIH-AuNR treated and control groups (Huang et al., 2019).",

While screening a variety of peptide fragments spanning the SARS-CoV S protein for SARS-CoV infection inhibitory activity, researchers identified inhibitory peptides P6, P8, and P10. P10 was derived from the HR2 region, and thus its inhibitory capabilities results from blocking 6-HB formation (Zheng et al., 2005). Intriguingly, P6 and P8 were derived from regions slightly upstream of the S1/S2 and S2\u2019 cleavage sites, which suggest that non-HR regions may be of interest as an anti-fusogenic strategy. The authors hypothesized that the antiviral activity of P6 could result from interference with S1/S2 cleavage, preventing conformational changes for fusion.",

There are in vivo mouse trials with the HR2P-M2 peptide (Channappanavar et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2015), though only time will tell if these peptides will become FDA-approved. An alternative strategy is to screen FDA-approved drugs for their ability to inhibit CoV membrane fusion because the time frame and monetary cost associated with repurposing approved drugs is generally less than developing novel drugs. An initial screen identified imatinib, an Abelson kinase inhibitor (Dyall et al., 2014). Abelson kinases are tyrosine kinases that regulate a variety of cellular pathways and have been previously shown to inhibit viral replication of other viruses, such as Ebola virus, coxsackie virus, and vaccinia virus, at different stages. Subsequent studies demonstrated that imatinib inhibits SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pseudovirus fusion with BSC-1 and Huh7 endosomal membranes, respectively (Coleman et al., 2016). As Abelson kinases are involved in pathways that enable cytoskeleton rearrangements, it is hypothesized that they inhibit fusion by preventing key cytoskeleton rearrangements for fusion (Sisk et al., 2018).",

TMPRSS2 knockout mice demonstrated less severe immunopathology when infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, however, at least for SARS-CoV, viral spread was still detected in the alveoli (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019). This suggest that other proteases, such as cathepsin L, could be activating the virus, and that the endosomal route may hold clinical relevance. Thus, it is important to expand research efforts to understand the role of these other proteases. As a starting point, identifying the elusive cathepsin L cleavage sites would provide greater insight into additional fusion-relevant domains within the S protein. Furthermore, both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have predicted cleavage sites at the S1/S2 and S2\u2019 positions (Coutard et al., 2020; Millet and Whittaker, 2014; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Although furin has been shown to process the MERS-CoV S1/S2 site during biosynthesis, the role of furin or furin-like proteases for SARS-CoV-2 entry is currently unknown, but will likely fundamentally affect viral entry. It is also important to note that key in vitro results should be corroborated with in vivo experiments, as knowledge of clinically relevant routes, proteases, and S domains can guide therapeutic development to block viral entry. In a similar manner, studies to determine the impact of cholesterol and Ca2+ on SARS-CoV-2 would be of interest to guide novel antiviral strategies.",

For MERS-CoV: If furin cleaved the S protein at S1/S2 during biosynthesis, exogeneous and membrane bound proteases, such as trypsin and TMPRSS2, will trigger early entry (2a).

Upon viral entry, copies of the genome are made in the cytoplasm (5), where components of the spike protein are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6).
