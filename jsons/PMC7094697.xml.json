Apparently the N3 atom avoids any gold\u2013nitrogen interaction owing to the steric hindrance caused by the O atom. A more favored adsorptive site can be enumerated theoretically by estimating the atomic charges on each of these probable active sites [49]. Higher the negative charge density on the atom, higher the probability of it acting as an adsorptive site for the gold substrate. Theoretical results estimated from calculations show that the partial atomic charges on the nitrogen and oxygen atoms determined by the natural population analysis (NPA) are \u22120.255 (N1) and \u22120.692 (O1), respectively. The negative charge density is observed on O1 atom and N1 atom, thereby the active may involve these atoms in the adsorption process. The enhancement decreases rapidly as a function of distance from the Au surface. The bands at 1264 and 1464 cm\u22121 which are ascribed to the C\u2013O stretch and CH3 asymmetric deformation, respectively, both exhibit very strong enhancement in SERS spectrum, this evidence substantiates involvement of O1 atom and N1 atom in the adsorption process.",
