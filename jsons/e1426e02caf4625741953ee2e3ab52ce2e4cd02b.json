The \"solidarity principle\" enables the Union also to provide \"measures appropriate to the economic situation, in particular if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products\" (Art 122 (1) TFEU).

The Union is competent to promote mutual recognition across the internal market of fast-track qualifications of medical professionals, introduced by several Member States in response to COVID-19, 36 and to reduce the minimum time required to qualify in a medical specialism. 37 This Union competence is consistent with Union internal market powers, not least because it leaves Member States more discretion to adopt higher domestic standards.",

Negative incentives include exclusion from those resources, and also fines or other sanctions adopted against Member States. Incentive measures could be combined with binding Union coordinating measures to enhance national compliance. The Union might thus be empowered to reinforce measures that are already required by secondary Union law, such as reporting through the Union's Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), including sharing personal data necessary for contact tracing. 40 Going further, Union law could provide positive incentives to Member States that, for example, impose temporary travel bans; or even those Member States that mandate curfews at the first outbreak sites. Incentives could, for instance, involve access to more Union resources for those Member States that reach certain targets of disease control and containment of COVID-19, encouraging Member States, for example, to impose strict quarantine measures. The Union's basis for action is stronger in the case of Union measures like these that seek to prevent the outbreak of a communicable disease becoming a cross-border problem, or to reduce the cross-border nature of a serious health threat such as COVID-19.",

Nonetheless, taking into account general principles of Union law, such as the precautionary principle, the proportionality principle and especially the Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 35, on the right to healthcare, we might consider the possibility of Union competence to incentivise Member States to provide localised, temporary, ad hoc and contextspecific solutions to concrete cross-border problems with regards to health services that arise when fighting threats to public health, such as COVID-19. The Union perhaps has competence to adopt measures that, for example, provide resources to health service providers working together on COVID-19 responses across an internal Union border where existing health corridors already involve sharing resources. 42 39 For example, Member States' competent authorities and healthcare professionals have access to the COVID-19 Clinical Management Support System (CMSS) in order to ensure a quick exchange of knowledge and experience between clinicians from across the Union and European Economic Area on how to manage patients with severe COVID-19. Any clinician working in a hospital treating complex COVID-19 cases can have access to the web conferencing system and be supported by a dedicated helpdesk. See Guidelines on EU Emergency Assistance on Cross-Border Cooperation in Healthcare related to the COVID-19 crisis COM (2020) 111, 3 April 2020, para 8.

Here, we note the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) approach to interpreting a \"cross-border\" element in internal market law: even a potential effect on the ability of factors of production (including people) to cross borders is enough to bring the matter within the scope of Union law. 43 Finally, and most ambitiously, if we consider that a \"backstop\" of Union measures that apply in the absence of Member State action would \"incentivise\" Member States to act, the Union would have competence to adopt a very wide set of measures indeed. In the absence of domestic measures to coordinate, the Union mighton an untested interpretation of the relevant competence normhave the power to adopt binding risk-based, local and temporary measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 that apply in the absence of domestic action. This approach skates very close to \"harmonisation\", hence would only justify temporary and localised mandatory Union acts.",

Protection of human health is a general principle or value inherent in Union law, which takes precedence over mere economic considerations. 44 The Union is obliged to \"mainstream\" human health in all of its policies and activities. 45 It has a residual power, 46 where no specific competence norm is present where necessary to achieve its objectives: this was the basis for Union health law and policy before 1993. 47 Textual differences between \"human health\" and \"public health\", which appear to distinguish types of Union competence (harmonisation, incentivisation, coordination), do not do so on closer inspection. Objections to the idea that the Treaties embody a \"web of competence\" greater than the sum of its separate parts go to questions of legitimacy of the Union as a non-state entity that nonetheless takes decisions on behalf of its people(s). These are well rehearsed in the literature, and we cannot resolve them here. But we note that the Union is far from a \"complete\" democracy, and that constitutional-type limitations on its powers are even more necessary than limits on the governments and administrations of states. In putting forward the idea of a \"web of competence\", we do not mean to argue that the Union has unlimited or extra-textual competences. Rather, we propose that the enabling texts of the Treaties be considered as a whole.

This inverts the traditional legal approach that health protection is an exception to the rule of free movement, and thus Member States may derogate from internal market rules 51 where necessary to protect public health. It is the Member States, on this interpretation, who can control or interrupt supply chains in the internal market, such as to prevent the export of medical equipment, devices or medicines necessary to combat COVID-19 and vital supplies such as food. The Union institutions only have the power to check for the proportionality of the measures, focusing on the domestic level. Member States can show that measures meet what is required by reference to the specific needs of their populations. 52 The web of competence suggests a different approach to the Union's competence to control national measures on the basis of proportionality. 53 This approach is based on the principle of solidarity between Member States, 54 the Union's obligation to protect public health 55 and the right to healthcare within Union law. 56 On this approach, scarce products needed for combatting COVID-19 need to be \"channeled to those who need them most\", 57 essential products, especially food, as well as medical equipment, devices and medicines. The internal market is at the service of the health of Europe's population. This is a novel interpretation of internal market law, not based on case law or any other legal instrument. It assumes a concept of Union public health and Union solidarity, rather than the usual interpretation where public health is a policy area in which domestic solidarity within Member States (and Member States' sovereignty in the health domain) is the principle that has to be traded-off against market integration. According to the Commission, this novel interpretation of proportionality means that an outright export ban on essential products will not be deemed proportionate. 58 National measures need to be aimed at ensuring that the products reach the persons who need them most considered at a Union level, and they need to suit the objective of protecting the health of people (again, at a Union level) who need them most. This is not the usual interpretation of Article 35 TFEU on export bans, or Article 36 TFEU, which was never intended to serve public health at Union level. But it is an approach that recognises the deeply integrated nature of the single market in goods and the drastic effects that abrupt closure of complex supply chains would have at a time when the Union's populations are already at risk. 59 The web of competence suggests that the Union institutions are empowered to take such decisions on this basis, preventing individual Member States from hoarding certain products or limiting their suppliers' access to the European market.",

Again, the power to restrain free movement of people, inter alia on public health grounds, is traditionally seen as being reserved to the Member States. 60 This division of powers suggests that the Union has no competence to act in response to COVID-19 by unified and mandatory restrictions on the free movement of people by, for example, screening passengers at airports and refusing permission to travel, monitoring individuals' movements by tracking mobile phone data or closing internal Union borders to people. For Union countries in the Schengen Area, in accordance with the Schengen Borders Code, 61 Member States retain the power to check internal borders where public security is at issue, 62 and to temporarily, and even immediately, 63 reintroduce internal border controls where necessary because of a serious threat to \"public policy or internal security\", 64 including \"contagious disease\". 65 The Council has the power to recommend (but not mandate) such a reintroduction of internal border control. 66 But, again, the web of competence would give the Union a basis to go further than recommending, as the Commission has already done, 67 checks on people crossing internal borders. 68 It would allow the Union to mandate such checks and to harmonise the conditions under which they are carried out. 69 Taking matters even further by adopting a very innovative reading, the web of health competence could potentially even allow the Union to reinterpret the \"no-bailout clause\", 70 if it could be considered as part of the Union's health powers (within a web of competence) in emergency circumstances, which would potentially open the way to the proposed \"coronabonds\" approach to the Union's post-COVID-19 economic recovery.",

The Union's competences also come with implicit responsibilities: if the Union has the power to respond to COVID-19, its citizens might legitimately expect it to do so. Further, with the responsibility to act come the implied means to take action: responsibility without enabling power and means (including funding) is meaningless.

But now the formal recognition of the Health Security Committee in Union law suggests that such a coordinating decision could lawfully be taken as a Union act.The Union also enjoys significant powers to deploy its own (admittedly relatively limited) resources, such as through its structural funding. 14 The Union has competence to fund collaborative research 15 into vaccines, treatments, new medical equipment and devices; epidemiological research into the spread of COVID-19; behavioural research into effective disease containment strategies; and social science research into the social, economic, political, legal and cultural consequences of COVID-19.
