The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ in the human body. However, it was considered a neglected organ. Since 1952, when King and Schumacker reported overwhelming post-splenectomy infection [1] , there has been a growing recognition of the importance of the spleen in the human body. Especially, in recent years, studies of spleen organization and structure, cell function, secretion, and innervations, a better understanding of the function has been gained. It has a fundamental role as the destruction of red blood cells, as the modulation of the immune system, and as the maintenance of peripheral tolerance via clearance of circulating apoptotic cells, the differentiation and activation of T and B cells, and production of antibodies in the white pulp [2, 3] .",

The cells of the blood-spleen barrier can trap circulating infectious organisms and monocytes clear them from the blood stream and providing a selective environment for monocyte differentiation into macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis of the microorganisms. The interactions between the circulating lymphocytes and macrophages may regulate the entry of lymphocytes into the white pulp. The functions of the blood-spleen barrier in the spleen are to filter antigens, to keep the microenvironment of the white pulp stable, and to present antigen information to white pulp through the effects of the mechanical barrier which depends on the connection between cells and the phagocytosis of macrophages. The blood-spleen barrier in the spleen is relatively loose without the tight junction between cells. However, the blood-spleen barrier has more ability to stop and phagocytize more xenobiotic materials than other barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier and the blood-thymus barrier [4, 5] . Table 3 .1 summarizes the functions of the spleen. As the spleen is strictly linked to liver, it influences on several kinds of liver disease, such as liver cirrhosis, ",

            "text": "In liver cirrhosis, a number of vasoactive substances have been implicated as potential mediators of portal hypertension. Especially, nitric oxide (NO), angiotensin II (Ang II), and endothelins (ETs) have received the greatest attention [10] . NO is a potent vasodilator, and there are 3 isoforms of NO synthase (NOS): inducible NO (iNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOS [11, 12] . ETs are a family of 3 related peptides, ETs1, 2, 3. ETs act as potent vasoconstrictors [13] . The respective roles of NOS and ET-1 have been well studied in cirrhotic liver [14, 15] . The mechanical obstruction is assumed to be caused by distortion and compression of the hepatic vasculature by increased fibrosis and nodule formation [16] . In addition, intrahepatic vascular bed is typified by an increase in resistance to blood flow in cirrhotic liver. Liver injury causes a reduction in the production of vasodilators by sinusoidal endothelial cells such as NO; concomitantly, there is an increase in the synthesis of vasoconstrictors such as ET1 and Ang II by other cells in the sinusoids. In mesenteric vasculature, increased portal blood flow from the splanchnic circulation augments portal pressure and thereby contributes to the maintenance and exacerbation of portal hypertension. In cirrhotic condition, the expression of ET-1 and Ang II is reduced in splanchnic circulation. On the contrary, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production are increased. Arterial vasodilatation in the splanchnic circulation plays a critical role in increasing the blood flow to the portal vein. Increased eNOS-derived NO plays a principal role in arterial vasodilatation [17] (Fig. 3.1) . In liver cirrhosis, the spleen is also a source of NO and secreted into portal blood flow affects a hyperdynamic state typical of patients with liver cirrhosis. A recent study indicates the possibility of the involvement of reninangiotensin (Ang) system [18] . Ang II is a vasoconstrictor generated by Ang-converting enzyme (ACE) and is further cleaved by ACE2 to Ang-(1-7). Ang-(1-7) is a vasodilator, which binds to the G-protein coupled receptor Mas (MasR) and leads to eNOS activation and NO production in endothelial cells [19, 20] . Besides NO, other vasodilators, such as CO, prostacyclin, adrenomedullin, endocannabinoids, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, also mediate arterial vasodilatation. These multiple factors seem to be involved in the excessive vasodilatation, observed in the splanchnic circulation.",

Liangpunsakul et al. [21] reported that 33 % patients with chronic liver disease were associated with severe hypersplenism. Although a number of factors contribute to hematological indices in patients with liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and alterations in bone marrow hormones appear to be the strongest contributions. It is generally accepted that pancytopenia results predominantly from the increased phagocytosis and destruction of hemocytes in splenic macrophages [22] . The rate of phagocytosis and the index of phagocytosis of splenic macrophages are notably in negative correlation with the count of leukocyte and platelet in peripheral blood. Regarding thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms include decreased production, splenic sequestration, endothelial dysfunction, and autoimmune destruction. Tana et al. [23] reported that the peripheral platelet count in patients with chronic hepatitis C was associated with liver fibrosis, thrombopoietin level, immature platelet fraction, and spleen size. Other factors that may influence the platelet count include platelet-associated antibodies and antiplatelet immunoglobulins. However, previous reports described that the presence of antiplatelet antibodies did not affect the platelet count [24] . Regarding the relationship between thrombocytopenia and liver fibrosis, Kondo et al. [25] clarified that patients with liver cirrhosis had a more extensive platelet area in the liver compared with those with normal liver. In cirrhotic liver, most platelets were present in the sinusoidal space of the periportal area with inflammation, where hepatic stellate cells expressing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-beta were frequently observed. Hepatic stellate cell is a key mediator of liver fibrosis. PDGF is the basic mediator involved in platelet granules. PDGF stimulates the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells [26] . So, they speculate that the accumulation of platelets in the liver may be involved in thrombocytopenia and liver fibrosis through the activation of hepatic stellate cells.",

As dysregulation of microRNA levels would affect the translation of multiple protein-coding genes, they speculated that has-miR-615-3p might regulate the activation of splenic macrophages and involved in the pathogenesis of hypersplenism due to portal hypertension.

Some basic studies have shown that splenectomy suppresses the progression of liver fibrosis. For instance, platelets are able to inhibit the development of liver fibrosis, and splenectomy exerts an antifibrotic effect via thrombocytosis [30, 31] . The loss of spleen-derived transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta)-1 mediates the inhibitory effect of splenectomy on liver fibrosis. TGF beta-1 induces the phenotypic transition of hepatic stellate cells to proliferating myofibroblast-like cells that increase the production of extracellular matrix components and reduce the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins. Decreases in portal flow and portal pressure are other possible mechanisms of the antifibrotic effect of splenectomy.",

The immune system can affect the progression of liver fibrosis because strain-specific differences in murine hepatic fibrosis are mediated by divergent T helper cytokine response [32] . In addition, immunosuppressants differently modulate hepatic fibrosis in mice and humans [33, 34] . These findings suggest that the spleen modulates hepatic fibrosis through its immunological functions. Previous studies have revealed that Th1 cytokines have a suppressive effect on liver fibrosis. In particular, interferon-r is a potent inhibitor of the activation of hepatic stellate cells [35, 36] . In contrast, Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 promote activation of hepatic stellate cells and progression of liver fibrosis [37, 38] . In mouse liver fibrosis model, CD4 + cells in the spleen migrated to the liver in response to liver injury. As Th2 lymphocytes are the main constituent of the immune environment in the spleen, most of the spleen-derived CD4 + cells in the fibrotic liver were Th2 cells. These findings as well as previous reports indicate that Th2-predominant splenic T lymphocytes migrate to the injured liver and promote liver fibrosis by modifying the Th1/Th2 balance in the liver toward Th2 dominance. Splenectomy decreases the absolute number of Th2 lymphocytes in the liver and reverses this Th1/Th2 imbalance, resulting in inhibition of liver fibrosis [39] . In human samples, Nomura et al. [40] reported that splenectomy significantly decreased liver fibrosis and the CD4 + /CD8 + , suggesting that splenectomy modified Th1/Th2 balanced to Th2 dominant and improved liver fibrosis in human.",

After a partial splenectomy in cirrhotic patients with splenomegaly, the remnant liver tends to regenerate to a small volume than in patients without splenomegaly [44] . However, the exact underlying mechanism for this effect has been elusive thus far. Two general mechanisms have been put forward. First, it has been proposed that the cytokines or growth factors released from the spleen influence liver regeneration by way of the portal circulation. The spleen promotes liver regeneration via preferential upregulation of heme oxygenase 1 and downregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha [45] . In addition, spleen-derived TGF beta-1 has been reported to play a critical role in inhibiting the growth of hepatocytes [46] . TGF beta-1 induces liver fibrosis. However, it also acts directly on hepatocytes by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis [47] . TGF beta-1 plays an essential role in the normal quiescent liver by inducing a tonic effect to hepatocytes to keep them in the G0 phase [48] . Although TGF beta-1 is produced principally in the hepatic stellate cells in the liver, it is also produced by the macrophages in the spleen and secreted into the portal vein in a liver injury model (Fig. 3.2) . Morinaga et al. reported that splenectomy significantly improved liver regeneration with reduction of plasma TGF beta-1 in cirrhotic model. Second, the hemodynamic alterations induced by a splenectomy are proposed to provide a favorable environment for liver regeneration. The splenectomy-induced increase in hepatic arterial flow with increased oxygen supply is also suggested to induce liver regeneration [49] . It is noteworthy that other spleen-derived factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activatorinhibitor (HAI) and ET-1 also impair liver regeneration in cirrhotic liver. Furthermore, Lee et al. [21] reported that splenectomy-induced upregulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and downregulation of TGF beta-1 in the injured liver. TGF beta-receptor II was more highly expressed in the injured liver, and c-Met, a HGF receptor, was more highly expressed in the injured liver with splenectomy. TGF beta-1 binds to its receptor, TGF beta-receptor II, at the end of the regeneration phase, and it induces the production of extracellular matrix in the liver. Newly synthesized extracellular matrix, especially glycosaminoglycans, would be capable of inhibiting urokinase-induced HGF activation by binding to HGF itself. This set of events would bring hepatocytes back into a stage of quiescence, surrounded by HGF and TGF beta-1. Splenectomy increased HGF level in the portal vein and also upregulated the expression of HGF in the liver. HGF in the liver is mainly produced in the hepatic stellate cells [50] and is known to be essential to initiate the process of liver regeneration. Activated HGF binds to c-Met and stimulates hepatocytes DNA synthesis via endocrine or paracrine mechanism. ",

Occlusion of peripheral portal veins in the liver and increased splenic blood flow as a result of splenomegaly have been reported to be the causes that give rise to portal hypertension. The presence of fibrotic portal tracts and thin fibrous septa in the absence of cirrhosis are pathological criteria for making a diagnosis of idiopathic portal hypertension. Clinically, the median value of liver stiffness in patients with idiopathic portal hypertension is lower than that in patients with liver cirrhosis. To the contrary, spleen stiffness is higher in patients with idiopathic portal hypertension [52] . Histologically, splenomegaly in idiopathic portal hypertension was attributed to an increase in venous sinuses in the red pulp [53] . In addition, the lymph follicles and the reticular fibers and collagen fibers around the splenic cords grow thicker in a diffuse manner, and narrowing of cord width and narrowing of the sinus lumens is seen. Moreover, the rod-shaped cells became deformed, fall into disarray, and diversify, and the slits between the rod-shaped cells enlarge [54, 55] . The basal lamina of the sinuses also thickens. Therefore, the splenic tissue hyperplasia characterized by fibrogenesis enlargement and passive spleen congestion are likely to cause the increase of spleen tissue stiffness. The spleen is also known to undergo fibrosis in liver cirrhosis, primarily, in the red pulp. The appearance of venous sinus hyperplasia in patients with liver cirrhosis is not so marked as in patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, and the rod-shaped cells in the venous sinuses do not diversify as much. The degree of splenic congestion and fibrosis in patients with liver cirrhosis might be smaller than that in patients with idiopathic portal hypertension. Regarding the pathological difference of the spleen between idiopathic portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis, Sato et al. [44] reported that there is increase of Gamna-Gandy nodules, which developed in the lymphocyte sheaths around arteries and the splenic trabeculae, in idiopathic portal hypertension. Gamna-Gandy nodules are formed as a result of bleeding, fibrosis, and calcareous deposits after an increase in red pulp pressure due to venous congestion [56] . Gamna-Gandy nodules seem to be involved in increase of splenic stiffness. There is a strong possibility that portal hypertension due to narrowing of portal vein branches in the liver is not the only cause of idiopathic portal hypertension, and specific increase of spleen stiffness is the material primary factor.",

Fat-laden hepatocytes are swollen, and in steatohepatitis, further swelling occurs due to ballooning of hepatocytes to cause sinusoidal distortion. It reduces intrasinusoidal volume and microvascular blood flow. Involvement of other cell types, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells, and recruitment of inflammatory cells as well as platelets lead to dysregulation of microvascular blood flow.

[57] Reported that Colloid shift to the spleen was observed in patients with NASH comparing with simple steatosis. In a nutritional model of NASH in rats fed a methionine-and choline-deficient diet, the liver/spleen uptake ratio was significantly decreased in rats after 8 weeks of a methionine-and choline-deficient diet in comparison with control diet-fed rats [58] . In addition, the patients with NASH demonstrated higher IL-6 blood levels, spleen longitudinal diameter values, and VEGF concentrations than those of healthy subjects [59] .",

In addition, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines were produced and T cells showed increased proliferation rate in splenic cells of NAFLD than control. Splenic dendritic cells processing and presenting antigen activities were significantly decreased in NAFLD mice.",

[62] reported that in programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)-deficient mice underwent thymectomy 3 days after birth, immune dysregulation by a concurrent loss of Foxp3 + regulatory T cells and PD-1-mediated signaling induced fatal autoimmune hepatitis resembling acute-onset autoimmune hepatitis. In this model, CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell infiltration from the spleen with massive lobular necrosis in the liver, hypergammaglobulinemia, and production of antinuclear antibodies were observed. The spleen is an induction site for autoimmune hepatitis in this model, and splenic CD4 + T cells were differentiated into follicular helper T cells (T FH ) in the spleen. T FH cells expressing inducible costimulatory (ICOS) and C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) five comprise a newly defined effector T-cell subset that powerfully assists B cells in forming germinal centers [63] . Dysregulated T FH cells promoted hypergammaglobulinemia and antinuclear antibody production in this model. T FH cells migrated from the spleen to the liver through the C-C chemokine receptor 6/C-C chemokine ligand 20 axis, triggering induction of autoimmune hepatitis. Regarding the fetal progression of autoimmune hepatitis in the model, they also reported that dendritic cells (DC)-derived IL-18 induced the differentiation of Th1 and CD8 + effector cells in the spleen and hepatic macrophages/Kupffer cells producing CXC ligand 9 (CXCL9) induced the migration of these cells to the liver. TNF-alpha directly induces maturation of DCs, TNF-alpha and IL-18 may directly induce inflammasome upregulation and skew toward IL-18 production. TNF-alpha induces cell death of hepatocytes and free DNA released from apoptotic hepatocytes activates Toll-like receptor 9, triggering a signal cascade to induce pro-IL-18 [64] . Therefore, TNF-alpha may induce apoptosis of hepatocytes, triggering canonical IL-18 production. However, IL-18 may act as an autocrine for skewing prolonged IL-18 secretion in DCs. They concluded that IL-18 induced differentiation of CD4 + T into Th1 cells and CD8 + cells into effector T cells, following CXCR3-CXCL9 axis-dependent migration of these cells to the liver which induce fatal progression of autoimmune hepatitis [65] (Fig. 3.3 ). In addition, they showed that although corticosteroid therapy was effective for autoimmune hepatitis in mice, it allows residual splenic dysregulated T FH cells to remain after treatment, which appear to be responsible for relapse. Splenectomy overcomes this insufficiency, including prolonged remission of autoimmune hepatitis in mice [66] . Furthermore, they reported that in another mouse model which developed chronic autoimmune hepatitis with fibrosis, hypergammaglobulinemia, and antinuclear antibody production, neonatal splenectomy suppressed the onset of chronic autoimmune hepatitis. These findings indicate that the spleen is a very important organ for the induction and progression of autoimmune hepatitis.",

In autoimmune diseases, the germinal center may be a pathogenic hot spot for production of autoantibodies [69] . T FH cells are located in germinal center where primarily drive B cells differentiate into memory B cells and form antibody-producing plasma cells [70] . Wang et al. [71] reported that Splenic T FH cells (CXCR5 + and CD4 + ) increased in peripheral blood of primary biliary cholangitis than that in autoimmune hepatitis. Splenic T FH cells were localized in germinal center-bearing B cell follicles in primary biliary cholangitis. Circulating (CXCR5 + and CD4 + ) T FH cells persisting for a long time in blood. Upon subsequent antigenic stimulation, these memory cells may quickly form T FH cells and promote germinal center responses. Uncontrolled generation of circulating T FH cells may reflect germinal center dysregulation and play an important role in amplifying autoreactive B cells, promoting pathogenic autoantibody production, the onset of clinical symptoms, continued immune responsiveness, and eventually irreversible tissue damage [72] . In primary biliary cholangitis, there is a higher percentage of T FH cells in antimitochondrial antibody-positive patients than antimitochondrial antibody negative patients suggesting that T FH cells may be specifically involved in the production of autoantibodies [71] . In addition, they also clarified that circulating CXCR5 + and CD4 + T FH cells in patients with primary biliary cholangitis generated more IL-21 after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin and these cells induced na\u00efve B cells to differentiate to plasmablasts in order to induce the production of immunoglobulin under the stimulation of IL-21 [71] . Levels of CXCR5 + and CD4 + T FH cells were significantly lower in ursodeoxycholic acid responders than those in nonresponders. In patients with primary biliary cholangitis, circulating CXCR5 + and CD4 + T FH cells were also decreased in number in responders to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. In contrast, no significant changes in circulating CXCR5 + and CD4 + T FH cells was observed in nonresponders to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. These findings suggest that CXCR5 + and CD4 + T FH cells in patients with primary biliary cholangitis interact with localized B cells to form lymphoid follicle-like structures that promote B cells to differentiate to plasmablasts, a key factor associated with the pathogenesis of primary biliary cholangitis.",
