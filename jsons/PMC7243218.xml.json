Equity capital markets are not exempt, and shareholder activists\u2019 ability to shrewdly navigate the turbulent storm will be tested. We canvas the corporate terrain leading up to the COVID-19 health crisis, and then present some considerations from both the outside investor\u2019s perspective and the corporate insider\u2019s perspective. Finally, we discuss a possible direction of shareholder activism in Japan and the future Japanese market-sensitivity to international corporate governance norms.",

This is unsurprising given the abundance of public companies with solid performance, undervalued stock prices, excess cash reserves, vulnerable capital policies and often insulated management. In 2019, Japan was the most-targeted non-US jurisdiction, with local records of 19 activist campaigns, $4.5 billion in capital deployed, 58 public companies targeted, 22 shareholder demands for board representation and 14 proxy fights (Activist Insight 2020).",

Per the reflexive nature of market development, the growing success of early shareholder activists, coupled with attendant legal and regulatory developments, laid the groundwork for the current boom in Japanese shareholder activism, prominently led by Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management, Daniel Loeb\u2019s Third Point Management and Yoshiaki Murakami-related parties. The movement was further buttressed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s corporate governance reform initiatives through the Stewardship Code and Corporate Governance Code. Nonetheless, certain crucial structural impediments remained, pushing back against complete convergence.",

A byproduct of its war-era, bank-based economy, cross-shareholdings among affiliated firms meant that a portion of a public company\u2019s shares would be held by the company\u2019s banks, customers, suppliers, and other friendly partners. This leads to a structural conflict of interest, since such stable shareholders wearing two hats would often prioritize ongoing business relationships and stable business ties over high investment returns, decreasing pressure on firm\u2019s profit performance and cash returns (via dividends or share buybacks) and reinforcing managerial independence (Yoshikawa and McGuire 2008).",

Japan\u2019s unique capital structure of cross-shareholdings and stable shareholdings will only exacerbate such concerns, since a proportion of the listed company\u2019s shareholders will have the exact same skin in the game. Therefore, such conflicted shareholders may lend immediate managerial support now, in hopes that it may lead to reciprocal support. As such, shareholder activists may soon find that the support they can count on (e.g., domestic institutions) in proxy fights are now diminished during this period, as management distraction concerns and further instability exacerbation outweigh any potential benefits. Second, on the ideological front, usual activists\u2019 inefficiency arguments against cash-hoarders during prosperous times will now be poignantly countered with the raw experience of resiliency during these turbulent times (Lewis 2020).",

But whether this subsequently manifests in reality depends much on the surrounding circumstances that prevail long past COVID-19. First, given the fact that the Japanese market has long matured, and growth opportunities are increasingly scarce, the viability and sustainability of Japan\u2019s managerial capitalism may simply no longer hold true. Capital inefficiency due to managerial preference to lock in capital within the firm will generate ever-increasing agency costs. Second, the post-war-era agency cost hedges no longer operate to the same extent. For example, the economic incentive systems (lifetime employment, seniority-based wages) designed to align managerial interests within the company have eroded over time (Yoshikawa and McGuire 2008), coupled with ever-increasing reliance on temporary workers, as a creative adaptation of Japan\u2019s existing employment institutions, to cope with greater market pressures. Thus, the short-term inefficiencies of managerial capitalism may no longer produce long-term economic growth (to the same extent) given the modern circumstances of Japan\u2019s economy.",

The current hot potato in the financial realm surrounds the proper primary purpose of a company: should it be a purely profit-seeking private entity or should it resemble quasi-public entities focused on broader stakeholder considerations and thus indirectly, economic growth? The COVID-19 aftermath will produce unique invaluable research domain to better discern the resiliency of Japan\u2019s stakeholder-model economy (e.g., the number of Japanese corporate insolvencies vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S.) and thus contribute to discussions on comparative corporate governance. On a glass half-full approach, one could even posit that the timing of this black swan event could not be better, as the arguments for both potential points on the Pareto frontier can now be discussed adequately and frankly before significant transitionary costs are incurred as Japan (and many other economies) may be further shifting to a market-based, shareholder-oriented model. After all, there is no universal method for economic efficiency, and much stems from strategies tailored to a countries\u2019 current comparative institutional advantages.",
