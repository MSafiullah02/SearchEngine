Two of these cases are pediatric patients (3\u2010year\u2010old female and 7\u2010year\u2010old male). Comparing to the total number of infected cases, the percentage of pediatric cases might be high. Of these cases, all have a fever and there is a history of closed contact to infected patients in the family within 3 days. These cases were hospitalized and had a complete recovery. Since the cases are early detected by screening of risk contact person to the known COVID\u201019 cases, the patients did not show any serious lung abnormality, no lung infiltration from chest computed tomography (CT).\n3\n Indeed, different clinical features and chest CT findings are observed in COVID\u2010patients at different stages. The early diagnosis of pediatric COVID\u201019 in our setting might result in mild clinical presentation.",
