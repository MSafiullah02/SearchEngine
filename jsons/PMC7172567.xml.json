Interestingly, probiotic treatment alone was giving 48% of eradication. Results of the therapy were highly consistent with cag genotype. Patients were found to be statistically less susceptible (P < 0.05) to the therapy in case when the entire cag regulon was present regardless of the therapy used.

These findings were in accordance with the results from the culture-based analysis.

We present a cerebral case of WD in a 48-year-old male, successfully diagnosed by PCR of T. whippelii in the blood and the faeces. As far as we know this is the first case reported from Greece. For the diagnosis of WD histological examination of duodenum biopsy for diastase resistant, non-acid fast, periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive inclusions in macrophages, and molecular detection of the 16SrRNA genes of by PCR in CSF, blood and faeces were performed. The histological detection was negative. PCR was positive in the blood and the faeces of the patient and negative in the CSF. Seven months after the onset of antimicrobial therapy, PCR was negative in all three clinical specimens. In conclusion, the application of PCR proved to be an invaluable tool for the recognition, the differential diagnosis and the early start of the antimicrobial therapy of WD, a generally fatal disease, if it remains untreated.",

The choice of the antibiotics is often made exclusively on empirical basis although resistance to many therapeutically relevant antibiotics has been described. The mainstay of HP treatment in Denmark is various combinations of normally two of the following antibiotics: metronidazole, amoxicillin, tetracycline and clarithromycin. To clarify whether these compounds were to remain the drugs of choice we decided to determine the susceptibilities of metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, and amoxicillin against 180 HP strains recently isolated from patients with duodenal ulcer.

The ARR and the phenotypes of resistance for the isolates of the above four serotypes were similar with the corresponding ones of human isolates as resulted from a recent Greek study derived also from NRCSS (Eur J Epidemiol 2001; 17: 751\u2013755) a fact consistent with possible transfer of antibiotic resistant strains from animals to humans through the food chain. The incidence of resistance for the rest of serotypes was very low. All the examined isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, almost all the examined isolates belonged to animals bred at a non-industrial scale (e.g. pigeons) and the environmental isolates were sensitive to all tested antimicrobials, possibly because of the reduced antibiotic pressure in these isolates.",

Due to acute renal failure G was discontinued and V was changed to teicoplanin (T). He was transferred to our department because of persistent bacteraemia of 20 days duration despite adequate blood levels of T. Blood cultures revealed a MRSA strain with MICs of V, T, and L of 1, 2, and 0.75 mg/L, respectively. He was started on L (600 mg bid) and R (300 mg tid) and bacteraemia cleared the seventh day of treatment. He completed a 6-week course of L and a 3-week course of R. During his treatment he developed anaemia which was managed with blood transfusions and erythropoetin, mild leucopenia and mild thrombocytopenia. He was discharged afebrile with sterile blood cultures and a TEE showing reduction in the size of the vegetation. The patient remained well and blood cultures were sterile one month later while pancytopenia fully recovered. The MRSA isolate was investigated for heteroresistance to glycopeptides with (1) a simplified and (2) a detailed population analysis profile method. (1) 0.01 mL of a 108 CFU/mL bacterial suspension was plated on BHI agar with V (4 mg/L). Subclones that grew after 48 h were submitted to MIC determination. (2) Tenfold serial diluents of an inoculum of 108 CFU/mL were plated on BHI agar plates with increasing concentrations of V or T alone or with 4% NaCl. Viable colonies were counted at 48 h and plotted against the antibiotic concentration. Subclones with V MIC 4\u20136 mg/L were identified, suggesting that the isolate had heterogeneously reduced susceptibility to V which probably explained the failure of V treatment.

Many strains are antibiotic-resistant even for the presence of an eso-polysaccharide matrix. The aim of this work was to individuate, among 396 different Staphylococci of human and animal origin, the slime producing strains and to correlate the presence of biofilm to the resistance to eight antibiotics. A total of 185 coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) and 211 S. aureus isolated from different sources and identified with Sceptor System, were tested for antibiotic susceptibility (Kirby Bauer method) and for slime production (Polystyrene plates \u2013 stained with Alcian blue \u2013 Spectrophotometric reading at 450 nm). The strains were classified as weak, strong and no slime-producing on the basis of OD results. The results were submitted to statistical analysis using Student's t-test and chi-square tests. Evaluating the differences of slime production among medical and veterinary strains, we found different statistical frequencies (P > 0.001). No statistical differences were obtained between S. aureus and the other CNS. Instead, the statistical analysis on S. epidermidis vs. the other staphylococci has shown no statistical differences among average values using Student's t-test (P < 0.052) and significant frequency differences using chi square tests (P < 0.02). Finally in the CNS, between S. epidermidis and the other strains, no statistical differences were found. The relation between slime production and the origin of strains was evaluated and no correlation was found. About the correlation between antibiotic-resistance and slime production a resistance increment of about 30% was obtained in strongly slime producing strains. Staphylococcus spp. is often involved in nosocomial infections as complication of post-surgery wounds, catheters and orthopaedic devices. The presence of antibiotic-resistant strains interferes in the therapy successes and seems to be strictly related to biofilm production beyond that genetically acquired. Human and veterinary strains have shown a similar behaviour towards biofilm production and antibiotic-resistance. The results confirm that S. epidermidis is one of the most slime-producer and introduce S. aureus as a new high slime-producer.",

            "text": "DNA sequencing is the gold standard method for accurate genotyping of human papillomaviruses (HPV) and provides nucleic acid sequence information, which is the core of every organism. Pyrosequencing method has been successfully used for HPV genotyping with sequencing of only 14\u201321 bases. Multiple HPV infections are a common phenomenon in clinical samples with a varying rate depending on the group investigated. DNA sequencing techniques cannot differentiate between different genotypes as uninterruptible sequence results are obtained when multiples infections and unspecific amplification products are present in the amplicon. To address these problems, a type-specific multiple-sequencing primer DNA sequencing strategy, suitable for genotyping and detection of HPV-6, \u201311, \u201316, \u201318, \u201331, \u201333 and \u201345 has been developed. In the new method seven type-specific sequencing primers, combined in a pool, are added to the DNA sample. The oligonucleotide hybridising to the DNA sample will function as a primer during the subsequent DNA sequencing procedure. The new method is especially suited for detection and typing of samples harbouring different HPV genotypes (multiple infections) and unspecific amplifications, which eliminates the need for nested PCR, stringent PCR conditions and cloning. Furthermore, the method has proved to be useful for samples containing subdominant types/species, and samples with low PCR yield, which avoids re-performing \u2018failed\u2019 PCRs. We also introduce the sequence pattern recognition when there is a plurality of genotypes in the sample, which facilitates typing of more than one target DNA in the sample. Moreover, target specific sequencing primers could be easily tailored and adapted according to the desired applications or clinical settings based on regional prevalence of HPV as well as other microorganisms and viruses. As the cost for DNA sequencing is dropping, a sample could be sequenced in parallel with two or three different target specific primer pools covering a broader range of genotypes. The Pyrosequencing HPV detection assay is fully automated and could be used for detection and identification of different microorganisms and viruses.",

The mean age of patients was 26 years (range from 1 month to 65 years). We use the PCR method in CSF samples to identify the following virus: HSV, VZV, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, Adenovirus and Enterovirus, using specific primers for genome's regions that are highly conserved and that identify several serotypes of the same group, such as the primers for the 5\u2032 non-coding region of Enterovirus and the adenoviral hexon gene that allows the detection of 51 human adenovirus prototype strains and different genome variants, for the others virus we amplify the following gene fragments, BamHIW, MCP, gene for DNA polymerase, gene 28 and gene for VP1\u2013VP2 of EBV, CMV, HSV, VZV and Parvovirus B19, respectively. The viral nucleic acids were extracted from CSF specimen using the commercials kits, QIAamp\u00d2DNA Mini Kit and QIAamp\u00d2Viral RNA Mini Kit, for DNA and RNA extractions, respectively.

These specimens were collected from March 2001 to November 2003. DNAs were amplified using a new type of primer system, \u2018stair primer\u2019, in a single tube, bringing simultaneous amplification of the six Herpesviruses (Herpes Consensus Hybridowell, Argene Biosoft, France). The amplified product was detected by hybridisation in a microtitre plate with six different biotinylated probes, specific for the six viruses. The method was successfully tested with positive and negative controls from the European Union Concerted Action for Quality Control of Nucleic Acid Amplification in Diagnostic Virology (Herpes\u20132001 and VZV\u20132003 Proficiency Panels). According to our results: (a) HSV1 DNA was detected in one CSF specimen from a patient with aseptic meningitis, in three aqueous humor specimens from patients with uveitis, in one swab from a patient with herpetic vesicular skin lesions and in three conjunctival swabs from patients with conjunctivitis, and (b) VZV DNA was detected in two aqueous humor specimens from patients with iridocyclitis, in two swabs from patients with vesicular skin lesions, and in the vesicle aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage from the patient with varicella pneumonitis. The precise diagnosis of herpetic infection was available within 24\u201348 h, which allowed for an early initiation of adapted antiviral therapy.",

The pathogenicity of this bacterium is determined by the production of two major toxins: enterotoxin A (TcdA) and cytotoxin B (TcdB). However, C. difficile strains producing only toxin B (TcdA-TcdB+) can be isolated from AAD. The application of different typing methods has revealed that C. difficile is a heterogeneous species. O'Neill and colleagues developed a modification of PCR ribotyping method based on polymorphisms in the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic region spacer for the routine typing of C. difficile. In this study we used PCR-ribotyping methods to discriminate Polish C. difficile strains. For this purpose 78 Polish C. difficile strains isolated between 2002 and 2003 including our collection were studied. We have compared 49 Polish C. difficile strains randomly chosen with PCR-ribotypes of ARU Cardiff collection. Among these strains 43 were toxigenic: 23 TcdA+TcdB+, 20 TcdA\u2014TcdB+ but six strains were non-toxigenic TcdA\u2014TcdB\u2014. A total of 18 different ribotypes were detected among 49 Polish isolates. Among toxigenic strains (TcdA+TcdB+) we detected 13 ribotypes, among toxin B producing strains (TcdA\u2014TcdB+) only one ribotype was detected. Among non-toxigenic strains four ribotypes were detected. It seemed to be interesting to observe the dominating ribotypes. Between toxigenic (TcdA+TcdB+) five belonged to ribotype 014 and four to 046. All strains (n = 20) (TcdA\u2014TcdB+) belonged to one ribotype \u2013 017. In summary, PCR-ribotyping is a good method to discriminate C. difficile strains. We decided to continue further epidemiological study in Poland.",

Mean age was 83 (range 71\u2013100) years; sex-ratio (F/M) = 1.1; 90% (19/21) of cases had received one or more antibiotics before onset of diarrhoea.

Serotyping and genotyping were performed on isolates from 19 different stools; 16 of these strains belonged to the same type A1 whereas three displayed profiles different from the outbreak strain. Management of this outbreak consisted in reinforcement of contact isolation precautions for patients with diarrhoea, cohortage of infected patients in the same ward and in promotion of hand disinfection with an alcoholic solution. Environmental disinfection with hypochlorite was introduced during the outbreak. The ward where most transmission occurred was closed during 10 days for a completed disinfection after last patient discharge. After resolution of the outbreak, incidence for acquisition was 12 cases per 100 000 patient-days. Ninety per cent (19/21) of patients were treated by metronidazole or vancomycin. Relapses occurred in 29% (6/21) of patients. Two patients died with severe colitis. Mean hospital stay was 39 (range 11\u201397) days (annual mean of length of stay in the department = 21 days).",

The source of those infections might be staff members, contaminated water system, air-conditioning or pests.

This form is more resistant to external harmful conditions such as antibiotics, disinfectants or host defence. Bacterial adhesion was recognised as the important virulence factor for colonisation of patient or biofilm formation. In our study the susceptibility of 65 bacterial strains isolated in hospital environment (colonising or infecting patients or carried by German cockroaches) to antibiotics and chemical disinfectants was determined. Moreover the efficacy of the disinfectant working solution (active ingredients: sodium dichloroisocyanorate 1795.2 mg/L; glucoprotamine 5200 mg/L; potassium persulphate 4300 mg/L) on selected bacterial strains adherent to catheter (after growing for 5 days on it) by treating then for 15 min was determined.",

Mean CSF protein concentration was 210 mg/dL and mean CSF glucose concentration was 44 mg/dL. Only in 14 of 19 cases the microorganism was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. Acinetobacter spp. (11 cases), K. pneumoniae (two cases) and E. cloacae were the isolated microorganisms. Most of the Acinetobacter isolates were susceptible to carbapenems but all of them were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. A combination of carbapenem plus an aminoglycoside and/or vancomycin therapy was applied most of the patients. An additional intrathecal aminoglycoside dosage was needed for seven patients who responded poorly. The overall mortality rate in these patients was 43%.",

Outbreaks of nosocomial SSSS and impetigo bullosa in infants have been well-described to be associated with the well baby nursery. The source of infection has been traced to health care workers in the delivery room or the newborn nursery. The initial site of S.a. colonisation/infection may be the anterior nares, nasopharynx, conjuctiva, umbilicus and/or the blood rather than the skin.

            "text": "\nM. abscessus is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) that is emerging as a significant pathogen in humans, both as a respiratory pathogen in patients with or without recognised comorbidities, and as the agent of inoculation infections. The histopathologic features of the human infection suggest that M. abscessus causes a tuberculosis-like infection. We investigated the systemic challenge of C57BL/6 mice with the type strain of M. abscessus through intravenous and intraperitoneal routes. With both high (107 CFU) and low (105 CFU) doses, the initial bacterial load remained stable for 5 days in liver and spleen until the establishment of a granulomatous response. The differentiation of the granuloma (central F4/80+ epithelioid cells with a peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytic crown) was contemporary to a drastic decrease of the bacterial load in the organs studied. However, 90 days following the challenge some mice still harboured bacteria capable of in vitro growth in their livers and spleens despite an overall effective control of the infection, and all mice infected presented granulomas of various differentiation stages in their livers. This response is highly reminiscent of the IFN\u03b3 dependent response to M. tuberculosis. Mice deleted for the gene encoding IFN\u03b3 were challenged intraperitoneally with M. abscessus and significantly failed to reduce the bacterial load by day 14. We show for the first time that the rapidly growing M. abscessus can cause a long lasting, tuberculosis-like, IFN\u03b3 dependent infection in C57BL/6 mice. These results show promise for the elucidation of M. abscessus disease since data from M. tuberculosis might be relevant. Reciprocally, M. abscessus faithfully models key features of mycobacterial infection.",

Growth arrest in vivo (as in PABA synthase mutants) abolished infection (Brown et al., Mol Microbiol 2000; 36: 1371\u20131380) and deletions of different chitin synthase genes had an effect on virulence only if radial growth rate was reduced (Mellado et al., Mol Microbiol 1996; 20: 667\u2013679). We describe a kinetic microbroth method of measuring the growth rates of Aspergillus fumigatus spectrophotometrically. Using this method, growth rates (as defined by Vmax values) were determined for nine Aspergillus fumigatus isolates for which an LD90 value in temporarily neutropenic CD-1 mice, infected intravenously, had previously been obtained.",

Four probes were designed to perfectly match the wild-type (WT) sequences at mutation sites corresponding to aa-s 146, 149, 156, 179 and 238. Thus, mutations conferring ESBL activity were expected to specifically lower the melting temperatures (Tm-s) of the probe-template duplexes.

Demonstration of the cfiA and cphA genes by PCR, but not actual enzyme production, may be attributed to so-called \u2018silent\u2019 genes. Susceptible strains are known to be able to convert to high-level beta-lactam/carbapenem resistance by increasing the expression of \u2018nearly\u2019 silent metallo-beta-lactamase genes. Metallo-beta-lactamases have been found to be carried on a small plasmid (13.6 kb) that appears to be self-transmissible, posing a potential threat of rapid spread of resistance.

Two groups consisting only of strains isolated in the Far East are significantly remote from all other B. burgdorferi sensu lato species. Bootstrap values and distances among these groups suggest their solidity, especially genogroup 1. This, probably, indicates the distinct origin of defined genogroups 1 and 2 of B. garinii and may suggest another taxonomic status.",

This protein has enterotoxic activity; it causes fluid accumulation in a lamb ligated ileal loop model. To date, three different isoforms, designated bft-1, bft-2 and bft-3, have been identified. The literature regards the enterotoxin-producing property of B. fragilis as a virulence factor since these strains can be isolated more often from severe infections such as sepsis, or abdominal and deep soft-tissue abscesses.

Members of this genus are recognised as important opportunistic pathogens responsible for serious infections but the molecular mechanisms of enterococcal virulence are not yet completely understood. In this study 42 Enterococci from different sources, including clinical isolates (from human and veterinarian origin), non-clinical isolates and reference strains from 19 enterococcal species, were typified and their virulence potential characterised. The relationships among these Enterococci were first analysed using SmaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and M13 PCR-fingerprinting, in order to evaluate the genomic heterogeneity of the isolates. Enterococci were also screened for several virulence traits such as cytolysin (cyl genes), adhesins (agg, esp, EfaAfs and EfaAfm genes) and gelatinase (gelE), revealing distinct virulence potentials. In Enterococcus faecalis, it was recently described that some virulence determinants can be clustered on large pathogenicity islands and not only in pheromone-responsive plasmids. Dot-blot DNA-DNA hybridisation was used to locate virulence determinants in the bacterial genome of the Enterococci under study. No conclusive results were obtained for esp and gelE, whereas EfaAfs and EfaAfm were found on the chromosome as expected. Although cyl genes and agg are plasmidic, in most isolates, they were detected on the chromosome of five strains, suggesting that these Enterococci may harbour a pathogenicity island. Beyond the widespread nature of virulence traits, chromosomal integration of virulence genes seems to occur in different enterococcal species and isolates from non-clinical sources.",

The following important observations were made: (i) The C-patterns obtained for strains of any K-serotype were distinct from the C-pattern of all other K-serotypes, with the only exception of serotypes K22 and K37, which are known to cross-react, (ii) For 12 K-types, C-pattern variation was found among strains with the same K-serotype; in most cases, the strains with variant C-patterns belonged to other Klebsiella species than the reference strain. Thus, cps PCR-RFLP has a higher discriminatory power than classical K-serotyping. (iii) Within K. pneumoniae, we observed C-pattern identity among strains of a given K-type, for example K1 or K3, that were collected many years apart and from distinct sources. This stability of the C-pattern indicates that cps PCR-RFLP is suitable for long-term epidemiology of capsular types, (iv) Only 2.8% (compared with 8\u201323% for classical K-serotyping) of the strains analysed by cps PCR-RFLP were non-typable, because PCR amplification failed, (v) The value of cps PCR-RFLP for K-serotype determination was tested on 21 recent K. pneumoniae clinical isolates.

Besides, we used the methods of ribotyping and PCR typing which involved the \u2018random\u2019 primer, 1281, to elucidate genetical relationship between the strains of varying epidemic significance. The genome of clinical isolates obtained from patients during several epidemic outbreaks, was shown to be stable and to contain all the genes tested. C. vibrios isolated during the interepidemic period from natural ecosystems, formed a heterogenous population represented by single virulent clones that had retained the complete set of the genes under study, by non-toxinogenic strains, that had lost only individual genes and (or) pathogenicity blocks of genes, i.e. either CTXphi and RS1phi, or CTXphi, VPI and RS1phi, or by those carrying deficient prophages CTXphi (ctxA\u2014 zot+ ace+) and VPI (ctpA\u2014 aldA+ toxT+), as well as by clones containing only housekeeping chromosomal genes and sometimes a gene from the \u2018persistence island\u2019. As soon as virulent clones get into water environment, they lose their virulence blocks in the following order: CTXphi and RS1phi, then VPI, gene VPI-2 being the last one to be lost. In conformity with the results of the above three genotyping methods, epidemically hazardous strains, represented a homogenous group, suggesting a single clonal origin. Close genetical relationship between these strains and non-toxinogenic vibrios, that partly retained their virulence genes, was also established. At the same time, as shown by ribotyping and PCR typing studies, avirulent \u2018water\u2019 vibrios formed an independent group, because their genotypes manifested quite distinct features, in contrast to the first two vibrio groups. Thus, the observed genotype heterogeneity of El Tor cholera vibrios living in water ecosystems was likely to be a result of the loss of DNA fragments varying in their length and functions. The genotyping procedures used in the work made it possible to discover evolutional relationships among the bacterial strains under study.",

For assessment of the presence of enterotoxin (fragilysin) gene in analysed strains, the PCR method was used. DNA for PCR was isolated using Genomic DNA PREP PLUS (A&A Biotechnology, Poland) and amplification was performed in a Techne thermocycler with primers 404 (5\u2032-GAG CCG AAG ACG GTG TAT GTG ATT TGT-3\u2032-TGC TCA GCG CCC AGT ATA TGA CCT AGT-3\u2032). The PCR program consisted of the following steps: 94\u00b0C for 4 min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0 C (1 min), 52\u00b0 C (1 min) and 74\u00b0 C (1 min). Among the Polish 132 strains, 16 contained the fragilysin gene. Of the 53 French strains 10 contained the fragilysin gene. For all these strains, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed. Bacteria were suspended in SE buffer (75 mM NaCl, 2.5 EDTA pH 8.0), embedded in 0.5% agarose plugs and lysed overnight at 55\u00b0C. Plugs were washed five times in SE at room temperature afterwards. DNA in the plugs was digested using Not I (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Electrophoresis was performed in a CHEF Mapper (BioRad, Venendaal, The Netherlands). The voltage was 10 V/cm for 18 h with linear ramping from 5 to 35 s at \u00b160\u00b0 angles. In conclusion, 19% strains isolated in France and 15% of those isolated in Poland contained the fragilysin gene.

A pilot study was conducted from 1 October 2002 through 30 September 2003 in 23 medical centres in Paris and suburbs. For each patient, one isolate of each identified species was sent to the NRCM together with clinical data filled on a standard form. Identification was confirmed using phenotyping tests and a PCR assay was performed on all Candida albicans isolates to identify C. dubliniensis. Antifungal susceptibility testing to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and caspofungin was performed according to EUCAST recommendations. The median age of the 282 patients was 57 years [0\u201394 years], with a male predominance (59%). Underlying factors for yeast-related blood stream infections were often multiple for a given patient dominated by recent surgery (69%), central venous catheter (66%), hospitalisation in intensive care unit (53%), malignancy (42%), immunosuppressive therapy (28%), HIV infection (10%), solid organ (6%) or bone marrow (3%) transplantation and prosthetic devices (6%). Overall, the mortality rate was high with 43% of deaths within 30 days after the first positive blood culture. Candida spp. was the most frequent genus (96%) with C. albicans (49%), C. glabrata (14%), C. parapsilosis (13%) and C. tropicalis (10%) being the most frequent species isolated. Other Candida were recovered below 3% (C. krusei, C. kefyr, C. lusitaniae). Non- Candida spp. were Trichosporon asahii, T. mucoides, Geotrichum capitatum and Cryptococcus neoformans. Our data show that the percentage of non- albicans species equal that of C. albicans among the yeasts recovered during fungaemia. The proportion of the four major species differed significantly according to the presence of central venous catheter (P = 0.02). Analysis of the antifungal susceptibility testing results revealed that most of the isolates had usual antifungal susceptibility profiles. In conclusion, ASPYRIF is a powerful tool that should allow us to accurately describe the epidemiology of yeast-related blood stream infections in France without restriction to any underlying disease or species.",

Fifty percent of cases were diagnosed in the Intensive Care Units, and 36% in Haematology units (28% in adults and 8% in paediatrics). Neutropenia was the major risk factor in 55% of the patients (during haematological malignancies and solid cancers). However, we also noted an increasing number of IA in patients under corticosteroid therapy for COBP, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Horton and microvascular diseases, in comparison to available data in the literature. Other cases occurred in solid organ transplant recipients and only one out of the 80 patients was infected by HIV. Prognosis factors will be discussed. Regarding biological diagnosis, good sensitivities of the mycologic examination (microscopy + culture) and the galactomannan antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay (Platelia Aspergillus, Biorad) were noted: 75 and 71%, respectively. The sensitivity reached 80% when both tests were combined. Pulmonary imagery was less efficient, probably due to the fact that, in our institution, CT scans are performed later than proposed in the literature. During this survey, we observed great modifications in therapeutic approaches. First line treatment progressively switched from deoxycholate Amphotericin B (AmB) to voriconazole and second line treatments now include lipid formulations of AmB and caspofungin acetate. AmB deoxycholate and voriconazole were the two drugs used for empirical therapy. The overall mortality was >70%.",

RNA was extracted at 9 and 17 h from cultures in Mueller Hinton + 2% NaCl (MHNaCl) and MHNaCl supplemented with 1 \u03bcg/mL Oxacillin (MHoxa). Quantitative transcriptional analysis of mecA, femABCDF, fmtA, mrp (fmtB), and mprF (fmtC) were performed by real-time RT-PCR. At least a 2.5-fold difference compared with the wild type in the average of three independent experiments was defined as cut-off for differentially expressed genes.",

Transcriptional analysis revealed that the homogeneously resistant mutant 1057rsbUVW displayed no differences compared with the wild type under all conditions investigated, except of the gene fmtA, which was downregulated in MHoxa at 9 h. Interestingly, in the less resistant mutant 1057rsbUVWsigB the genes mecA, femB, femD, fmtA, and mprF were upregulated in MHNaCl compared with the wild type at both time points, whereas in MHoxa only the genes femD, fmtA, and mprF were upregulated at 9 or 17 h.",
