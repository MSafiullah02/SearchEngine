Cholestasis may have been associated to the critical illness itself (inflammation), parenteral nutrition (only 2 patients required parenteral nutrition), or drug toxicity (all patients were on antibiotics, for example ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or azithromycin) [4, 5]. While cholestasis could have been multifactorial, the differential diagnosis was not easy to perform with precision. Overall, attention to modifiable factors, such as control of inflammation, timing of parenteral nutrition, and avoiding drugs with worse liver toxicity profile, may be important to prevent cholestasis progression in these patients. Further studies are needed to understand liver injury in critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially if there is any direct viral effect on the liver cells.",
