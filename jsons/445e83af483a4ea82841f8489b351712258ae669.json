The antiviral activity of cationic host defence peptides is of significant interest as novel therapeutics for treating viral infection and predominantly due to their broad spectrum antiviral activity. These peptides also display powerful immunomodulatory activity and are key mediators of inflammation. Therefore, they offer a significant opportunity to inform the development of novel therapeutics for treating viral infections by either directly targeting the pathogen or by enhancing the innate immune response. In this chapter, we review the antiviral activity of cathelicidins and defensins, and examine the potential for these peptides to be used as novel antiviral agents.",

While the antiviral activity of many peptides has been established in a significant number of studies, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism(s) of action involved remains elusive. Of particular interest are the immunomodulatory and inflammomodulatory activities of CHDP, from gaining a more fundamental understanding of innate responses to infection in addition to informing development of novel therapeutics. CHDP have been shown to have the capacity to modulate cell death pathways in infected cells, assist in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection, promote angiogenesis, alter immune cell differentiation and to mediate production of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines.",

PGs are produced and stored by porcine neutrophils as inactive propeptides but are proteolytically cleaved into their active forms by neutrophil elastase in the extracellular environment. Their expression is enhanced by bacterial LPS, IL-6, retinoic acid and salmonella infections (Wu et al. 2000) and PG-1 has been shown to have the broadest antimicrobial activity spectrum (Yasin et al. 1996a, b) . Cathelicidins have also been characterized in many other species, such as sheep, monkeys, horses and cows. In sheep, eight cathelin-associated peptides have been identified and SMAP-29 (sheep myeloid antimicrobial peptide 29) is one of the most potent cationic host defence peptide known in terms of antimicrobial activity, having a wide spectrum of activity against bacteria, fungi and virus (Tomasinsig and Zanetti 2005) .",

Recently, a number of studies conducted in humans, mice and other in vitro models have highlighted the potent antiviral activity of cathelicidins. Viruses that are most susceptible to cathelicidins include enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, and while all of the antiviral mechanisms remain to be elucidated, there does appear to be a direct effect on the viral envelope. However, non-enveloped viruses such as adenovirus can also be inactivated by cathelicidins (Gordon et al. 2005; Barlow et al. 2014) . Therefore, the antiviral activity of these peptides likely comprises complex array of mechanisms that cannot all be explained by a direct effect on the virus particles.",

It has also been shown that vaginal fluid of healthy women has intrinsic anti-HIV-1 properties and these were conferred by cationic polypeptides. A depletion of cationic polypeptides caused a reduction of the intrinsic anti-HIV-1 activity (Venkataraman et al. 2005) and, in addition to this, cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) of Kenyan women in HIV-serodiscordant relationships contained HIV neutralizing activity and CVS which revealed no intrinsic anti-HIV activity could be enhanced by the addition of recombinant LL-37 (Levinson et al. 2012) . Further studies have revealed that high concentrations of LL-37 were found in cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) collected from Kenyan sex workers with bacterial transmitted infections, which are associated with increased HIV acquisition (Levinson et al. 2009 ).

LL-37 inhibited RSV replication and decreased the spread of infection, and these effects were highest when the peptide was pre-incubated with RSV or added to cells simultaneously. This study demonstrated that LL-37 mediates direct effects against the virus particles, similar to the action of LL-37 against influenza A virus (Tripathi et al. 2013) . It was also demonstrated that a delayed LL-37 exposure, taking place 2 h after infection, resulted in the loss of antiviral effects which revealed the inability of the peptide to rescue infected cells. However, pre-treating cells with LL-37 prior to infection resulted in a reduction of infectivity, suggesting that the peptide is retained by the epithelial cells exerting a protective antiviral state. These results indicate that LL-37 can protect epithelial cells from viral infection through a mechanism distinct from direct antiviral activity. In addition, LL-37 was also shown to actively protect RSV-infected epithelial cells from cell death.",

Another study examined the underlying mechanism for the potent antiviral activity of indocilidin observed against HSV type -1 and -2 in vitro, and suggested that the mechanism underlining the antiviral activity was related to the ability of the peptide to disrupt the viral envelope, thus inactivating the virus particles (Albiol Matanic and Castilla 2004) .

In addition, a particularly physiologically relevant model was employed whereby human keratinocytes cells were pre-incubated with HSV for a period of 6 h before treatment with LL-37 for 18 h to assess whether intracellular viral replication could be inhibited with physiologic concentrations of LL-37 (Howell et al. 2006) .

LL-37 demonstrated a significant reduction of Ad19 titer in vitro (2 log Rothan et al. (2012a, b) reduction over 4 h). This study also provided some insight on a potential antiviral mechanism of cathelicidins, based on the comparison of HSV and Ad19 time-kill assays. The data demonstrated a rapid killing of HSV-1 which suggested a disruption of the viral lipid membrane as a possible mechanism. Several other studies have also proposed similar mechanisms for other cathelicidins (Robinson et al. 1998; Albiol Matanic and Castilla 2004; Dean et al. 2010) . Interestingly, for the Ad19 strain, LL-37 produced a much slower progressive reduction in virus titers. As adenovirus lacks a viral envelope, this suggests that the direct antiviral mechanism of cathelicidins does not involve membrane disruption. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed such as disruption of the adenovirus particles (detergent-effect) and/or blockage of viral entry into the cell.",

Of note, despite RNA transcripts for \u03b8-defensins are found in human bone marrow cells, a premature stop codon prevents protein translation (Nguyen et al. 2010) . Neutrophil \u03b1-defensins (HNPs 1-4) are mainly synthesized as prepropeptides in promyelocytes in the bone marrow, and the mature peptide is stored in the granules of neutrophils. These peptides are found in lower concentrations in NK-cells, B-cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells, monocytes, macrophages and immature dendritic cells (Rehaume and Hancock 2008) . In contrast, human alpha defensins 5 and 6 (HD5 and HD6) are constitutively expressed and secreted as a propeptide in Paneth cells, salivary glands and also in genital mucosa (Ouellette 2006) . Human \u03b2 defensins (HBDs) 1-3 are mainly expressed in epithelial cells, but can also be found in immune cells, mainly monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells, whereas 3 \u03b8-defensins (RTD1-3) have been found in rhesus macaque leukocytes (Ganz 2003; Tang et al. 1999) .

HNP-1 is clearly deleterious for viral dissemination, having a direct effect against a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of viral particles in the absence of serum, whereas in the presence of serum HNP-1 acts on host cells (Chang et al. 2005) . One of the suggested mechanisms for such cellular effects is the HNP-1 mediated inhibition of the PKC signalling pathway, which is required for viral uncoating (Fields et al. 1988 ). Importantly, this HNP-1 effect did not affect the expression of viral receptors CD4, CXCR4 or CCR5 (Chang et al. 2003) . Interestingly, as a part of its direct effects on HIV viral particles, HNP1-3 peptides were shown to interact with gp120, a viral glycoprotein, thus impairing viral attachment to cell membranes. This effect was further potentiated by HNP-1-3 interactions with cellular CD4. Both antiviral effects were reduced, but not completely abolished by the presence of serum (Demirkhanyan et al. 2012; Furci et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2004) . A closely related peptide, HNP-4 was also able to bind gp120 and CD4 (Wu et al. 2005) . A more indirect but also effective anti-HIV effect of HNP-1-3 peptides is their capacity to increase the secretion of the C-C chemokines MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and RANTES, which can bind to CCR5 to act as antagonists for viral R5 strains that use CCR5 as a co-receptor (Guo et al. 2004) .",

Interestingly, hBD1 was neither upregulated nor protective in this context. However, hBD2 and hBD3 did appear to act both directly on viral particles, and also on the host cell, by downregulating CXCR4 expression. Accordingly, these peptides were found to be more effective against X4 viral isolates.

The virus utilizes A.aegypti as a vector for transmission to humans and induces an innate immune response, characterized by the expression of a cecropin-like peptide, produced by up-regulation of the AAEL000598 gene. The peptide is subsequently cleaved from (2001) CMV dsDNA Modest direct antiviral effect (Daher et al. 1986) HIV-1 ssRNA Direct effect on virion; blocks viral gp120-cellular CD4 interaction; blocks host PKC signalling, affecting reverser transcription and integration; increased secretion of C-C chemokines Wang et al. (2004) an immature form into a mature active form. Interestingly the immature (MK) form of the cecropin-like peptide was more active against all four strains of Dengue virus tested (Dengue-1, -2, -3 and -4) than the mature (GK) cleaved form. The authors also established that both the GK and MK forms of the peptide were active against Chikungunya virus, a pathogen also transmitted by the A. aegypti mosquito that can cause fever and severe long lasting joint pain. Another study revealed that scorpine, a hybrid peptide with structural similarities to cecropins and defensins derived from the venom of the scorpion Pandinus imperator, also exhibited antiviral activity against dengue virus by inhibiting the replication of Dengue-2 virus (Carballar-Lejarazu et al. 2008) . Cecropin A is reported to inhibit HIV production by infected T-cells and fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (Wachinger et al. 1998) . The mechanism responsible for this inhibition was found to be reduced viral gene expression and synthesis of viral products, indicating that Cecropin has an antiviral role beyond that of direct interaction with the HIV virion.",

Another study by Lorin et al. identified Dermaseptin S4 as having potential inhibitory activity against HIV-1 by inhibiting viral infection of human primary T-lymphocytes (Lorin et al. 2005) . The authors attributed this activity to a direct disruption of the virion and, while the parent peptide elicited cytotoxicity at higher concentrations, were able to reduce host cell cytotoxicity by reducing the positive charge of the native peptide through amino acid deletion or substitution. Notably, the modified peptides were also able to reduce HIV-1 binding to endometrial cells together with inhibition of capture and transmission of virus from dendritic cells to CD4 + T-cells. Dermaseptin S9 was also identified as having weak activity against HIV-1, but a mutant S9 peptide, where three lysine residues were replaced with arginines, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 although the mechanism underlying this observation remains unclear ).",

Further evidence of antiviral activity of magainins was also revealed in a study by Chinchar et al.

(1991) who showed that the peptide could reduce virus-mediated cytopathic effects by more than 70 % in in vitro models (Morimoto et al. 1991) . The peptide also reduced the infectivity of the virus, an effect that was shown to be independent on the reverse transcriptase activity of HIV. Interestingly, subsequent studies by Nakashima et al. (1992) , Murakami et al. (1997) and Xu et al. (1999) characterized the activities of the isopeptideT22 (Tyr 5,12 , Lys 7 -polyphemusin II), and synthetic analogues against HIV, and determined that the antiviral activity was due to ability of the peptide to bind to CXCR4 (Xu et al. 1999; Murakami et al. 1997; Nakashima et al. 1992) . CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor used by T-cell tropic strains of HIV to infect host cells. Thus, the host cell mediated mechanism of action of these peptides against HIV contrasts to the direct antiviral activity exhibited by other CHDP.",
