            "text": "Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae (Wengler 1991). The virus causes disease that ranges from mild to severe in its natural hosts, domestic pigs and wild boars. Classical swine fever virus is an enveloped virus with a positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA genome of approximately 12 300 nucleotides. The genome encodes a single open reading frame that is flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Classical swine fever virus is currently categorized into three genotypes: 1, 2 and 3 that can be further divided into 11 subtypes: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 (Lowings et al., 1996; Paton et al., 2000; Postel et al., 2013). Other pestiviruses that infect livestock are bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1 (BVDV\u20101) and type 2 (BVDV\u20102), border disease virus (BDV) of sheep, the recently described atypical pestiviruses (Schirrmeier et al., 2004; St\u00e5hl et al., 2010) and Bungowannah virus (Kirkland et al., 2007). Classical swine fever (CSF) is an OIE\u2010listed notifiable disease that can have an enormous effect on the livestock industry and on trade. For instance, the direct costs of the 1997\u20131998 epizootic in the Netherlands, excluding loss of exports, amounted to $2 billion (U.S.) and the slaughter of approximately 10 million pigs (Terpstra and de Smit, 2000). While CSFV has been eradicated from regions such as North America, Australasia and parts of northern Europe, it remains widespread in regions that include South America, eastern Europe and South\u2010East Asia (Vargas et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Pestiviruses are closely related genetically and antigenically. While infections in swine with pestiviruses other than CSFV are usually benign, they do present diagnostic problems: they cause serological cross\u2010reactions in antibody tests (Colijn et al., 1997; Langedijk et al., 2001). Virus isolation is the method of choice for discovering infected herds at the early stage of infection (Terpstra and de Smit, 2000). However, rapid and sensitive tests for early detection of CSFV are desirable for containing outbreaks as conventional virus isolation procedures are time\u2010consuming and require cell culture infrastructure and expertise. Several conventional RT\u2010PCR and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assays have been described for detection of CSFV and other pestiviruses (Handel et al., 2004; Hoffmann et al., 2005, 2011; Risatti et al., 2005; Wernike et al., 2013). However, the high cost of current real\u2010time PCR devices, and the need for post\u2010amplification processing with conventional PCR may be a barrier to the widespread use of these technologies in field applications or in developing countries. Thus, low\u2010cost, sensitive and user\u2010friendly methods that can detect CSFV rapidly are still needed.",

Viral RNA for PCV1 and 2 was provided by Dr. Marcus Czub (University of Calgary). RNA was extracted from a total of 91 sera samples obtained from 12 healthy pigs and 12 pigs inoculated with four CSFV strains. Briefly, 7 to 8\u2010week\u2010old pigs were inoculated oronasally with the Peru LL28/2008 La Libertad\u2010Trujillo (n = 4), Peru L8/2008 Lima\u2010Villa El Salvador (n = 4), Honduras 1997 (n = 2) and Diepholz 1/Han94 (n = 2) strains. Serum samples that were tested fresh without RNA extraction were from pigs inoculated with the Koslov strain using the same method. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane by face mask and 1.5\u20132.0 ml of inoculum containing 106 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of each virus was administered per animal. Sera were collected before inoculation and also on various days post\u2010infection (dpi) for 4 or 5 weeks, or until the animal died or was euthanized. Viral RNA was extracted from serum samples using the MagMAX\u201096 AI/ND Viral Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the MagMAX Express 96 Processor (Life Technologies) and eluted with 50 \u03bcl of elution buffer.

Briefly, 763 nucleotide sequences of the CSFV 5\u2032UTR region were collected from the CSF Database, EU and OIE Reference Laboratory for CSF (http://viro60.tiho-hannover.de/eg/csf/index.php) and aligned to identify conserved regions that can be used for the design of iiRT\u2010PCR primers and probes. Classical swine fever virus 5\u2032UTR\u2010specific primer and probe set were designed according to the recommended principles for iiPCR (http://www.iipcr.com/eweb/uploadfile/20130522114104277.pdf). The recommended length of the primers was between 18 and 30 bases, have a GC content of 45\u201360% and a T\nm of 56\u201360\u00b0C. Repeat sequences, four or more consecutive Gs or Cs and hairpins and primer dimers were avoided. The probe had a length of <30 bases, a GC content between 30% and 80% and a T\nm that was 10\u00b0C above the T\nm of the primers. Runs of a single nucleotide and four or more consecutive Gs or a G at the 5\u2032 end of the probe were avoided. The amplicon was approximately 100 bp, within the recommended range of 70\u2013150 bp. No major secondary structures were found in the amplicon, based on prediction made by the mfold program (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold). Lyophilized iiRT\u2010PCR reagent was rehydrated with 50 \u03bcl of Premix buffer (GeneReach USA), and 5 \u03bcl of sample was added to the mixture. For laboratory\u2010cultured virus samples, 4 \u03bcl of dH2O was added to 1 \u03bcl of RNA or DNA, while 5 \u03bcl of neat extracted RNA, various volumes of neat unextracted serum and unextracted serum diluted 1 : 2, 1 : 5 or 1 : 10 in dH2O were used for serum samples. Both fresh and archived serum from CSFV infected pigs were used as indicated. Subsequently, 50 \u03bcl of the final mixture was transferred to an R\u2010tube\u2122 (GeneReach USA), which was spun briefly in a cubee\u2122 mini centrifuge (GeneReach USA). The R\u2010tubes\u2122 were placed into the reaction chamber of the POCKIT\u2122 Nucleic Acid Analyzer and a run was initiated. The POCKIT\u2122 Nucleic Acid Analyzer collected optical signals through an integrated circuits controller\u2010regulated (CMOS) sensor, and signal\u2010to\u2010noise (S/N) ratios were automatically calculated by dividing light signals collected after iiRT\u2010PCR by those from before iiRT\u2010PCR (Tsai et al., 2012). According to default S/N thresholds, results were converted automatically to \u2018+\u2019, \u2018\u2212\u2019, or \u2018?\u2019 and displayed on the screen at the end of the run. All samples tested gave either \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018\u2212\u2019 result, with the exception of 5 \u03bcl of undiluted and unextracted serum, which all gave \u2018?\u2019 results.",

The assay detected RNA from a broad range of CSFV strains (n = 34) representing all three genotypes and did not show cross\u2010reactivity with other pestiviruses and other livestock\u2010associated viruses. For the testing of serum samples from experimentally infected pigs, less RNA (5 \u03bcl) was used for the iiRT\u2010PCR than the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (9 \u03bcl) routinely employed at the Canadian Reference Laboratory for CSF, and the iiRT\u2010PCR detected Honduras 1997, Peru L8/2008 and LL28/2008 RNA in serum samples that were negative by the 40 cycle real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay. These results suggest that the iiRT\u2010PCR may be slightly more sensitive than the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR at least for certain strains. The sensitivity of the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR may be improved by increasing the cycle number; however, this will also increase the time required to complete the assay. Real\u2010time PCR will allow simultaneous amplification and quantitative real\u2010time detection of amplification, while iiRT\u2010PCR is an end\u2010point assay. The manufacturer set threshold for positivity was used in this study for the iiRT\u2010PCR assay, but it is possible for the user to adjust the cut\u2010off for positivity with custom programs. Not including the time needed to extract RNA, the iiRT\u2010PCR took less than an hour to complete, much less than the approximately 2\u20132.5 h needed for the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR used in this study.",

These results suggest that 4 \u03bcl of neat unprocessed serum and 5 \u03bcl of 1 : 2 diluted unprocessed serum may be close to the maximum amount of unextracted material that can be used in the CSF iiRT\u2010PCR assay.

            "text": "Loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods that do not require expensive instrumentation have been suggested as suitable platforms for field applications (Notomi et al., 2000). Several in\u2010house LAMP assays have been developed for the detection of CSFV nucleic acids and tested with regional isolates or strains representing a small number of CSFV subgenotypes, and few if any non\u2010CSFV pestiviruses (Chen et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010). In contrast to earlier CSFV\u2010specific LAMP assays which utilized agarose gel electrophoresis or visualization with the naked eye for interpretation of results, a LAMP assay combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) that was validated with a large panel of pestivirus strains was recently described (Chowdry et al.,\n2014). In this study, seven (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1) of eight subgenotypes tested were detected, but the assay failed to detect the genotype 3.4 Kanagawa strain, perhaps due to mismatches with the primers used in the assay (Chowdry et al., 2014). The LAMP\u2013LFD assay had an analytical sensitivity of approximately 100 copies per reaction on the two genotypes tested. In contrast, the iiRT\u2010PCR described in this study detected strains representing all eight subgenotypes tested, including the Kanagawa strain, and had a limit of detection of about 23 copies, suggesting the iiRT\u2010PCR assay has broader coverage and may be more sensitive than the LAMP\u2013LFD assay. Both the RT\u2010LAMP and iiRT\u2010PCRs are simple to perform and can be completed in approximately an hour. RT\u2010LAMP assays can be performed with just a water bath or heat block and results can be visualized without instrumentation. Thus, LAMP assays that do not require a signal detector may be less costly to perform than iiRT\u2010PCR if cost, and not sensitivity is the primary concern. However, genetic variations of target viruses can have a big impact on the sensitivity and reliability of a LAMP assay due to the use of 4\u20136 primers. Thus, use of LAMP assays where broader genetic variation of CSFV may be encountered will require further validation with more genetically diverse CSFV and non\u2010CSFV samples. The iiRT\u2010PCR assay for CSFV reported here is commercially available and utilizes lyophilized reagents, while the LAMP assays for CSFV detection reported to date are in\u2010house assays using wet reagents. Thus, further development and validation of the LAMP assays using lyophilized reagents are desirable for on\u2010farm detection.",

However, an instrument with a throughput of 24 samples per run is available and with the high sensitivity of the iiRT\u2010PCR assay, pooling of samples should be feasible. In combination with existing commercial portable automated nucleic acid extraction systems, the POCKIT\u2122 Nucleic Acid Analyzer, may have potential as a low\u2010throughput automated two\u2010step method for on\u2010site detection. The observation that low volume of serum can be used directly in iiRT\u2010PCR without nucleic acid extraction can potentially simplify the diagnostic workflow considerably in the laboratory and in the field, and shorten the time needed to obtain results from serum samples to <1 h.",
