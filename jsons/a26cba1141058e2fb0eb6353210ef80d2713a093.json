Preengraftment PCs are usually infectious and occur within 30 days of HCT. These commonly include Gram-negative bacterial pneumonias in the setting of neutropenia and/or mucositis. Early postengraftment PCs, which occur between days 30 and 100, typically include infectious processes associated with impaired cellular immunity.

Atypical processes may occur outside of these expected windows based on additional host risk factors (eg, opportunistic infection late after engraftment in the setting of delayed antibody response 21 ).

The latter indication is common after HCT 35 and in the setting of neutropenia, where 15% of patients with FN present with lung infiltrates. 36 The distribution and morphology of infiltrates can help to refine the PC differential diagnosis, although a diminished inflammatory response may alter or delay the appearance of typical findings. There are significant limitations to the sensitivity of chest radiographs for diagnosing PCs in HM and HCT patients, even when combined with clinical data. 37, 38 In 1 study of febrile immunocompromised patients, one-half of those with a negative chest radiograph had parenchymal abnormalities detected on computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest. 37 Thus, a reliance on CT imaging of the chest as the initial diagnostic imaging modality is commonplace in the management of the compromised host with respiratory complaints. 39 Chest CT is also performed routinely for disease surveillance during treatment of certain HMs (eg, lymphoma) and may be useful for comparison when diagnostic chest radiographs suggest a new PC. The special role of high-resolution CT has been considered useful in HM and HCT subgroups; however, their interpretation is not considered \"unambiguous.\" [39] [40] [41] PET scanning may be useful for the evaluation of a solitary pulmonary nodule, 42 and MRI may be required when a subject cannot receive iodinated contrast for a CT study, although a noncontrast CT is generally sufficient for the evaluation of parenchymal infiltrates. Abnormal parenchymal patterns Table 2 shows differential diagnoses to consider in the HM or HCT patient presenting with common parenchymal patterns on chest CT, including airspace consolidation, ground glass opacities, nodules, and reticular changes. Radiographic findings may be typical of certain clinical scenarios, for example, symmetric ground glass opacities with sharp margins in prior radiation fields suggest radiation pneumonitis, and diffuse reticular markings during a leukemic blast crisis may support pulmonary leukostasis. The differential may be justifiably narrowed quickly enough to warrant empiric treatment without more thorough investigation in select cases. However, radiographic abnormalities frequently overlap or are ill-defined, and their management may present conflict. For example, bacterial and fungal pneumonias often present as focal or multifocal airspace consolidation, as does noninfectious organizing pneumonia. Given that organizing pneumonia would require steroids for treatment, and that steroids would likely exacerbate an infectious process, further investigation is paramount. Along with the integration of information regarding underlying patient risk factors, clinical presentation, and abnormal imaging, results of noninvasive testing help to determine the next steps in management. In some cases, findings may be apparent on chest radiography, but chest computed tomography scans, especially when performed at high resolution, allow for earlier detection.

Additional assays are requested based on risk features of the patient, for example, endemic fungal exposures; and chest CT patterns, for example, nodule infiltrates, which may heighten suspicion for atypical processes. In recent years, culture-based methods of pathogen isolation from respiratory secretions or blood have been supplemented or supplanted by molecular testing techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, for diagnosis of infectious PCs ( Table 3) .

However, data from a large cohort of HCT patients showed hypoxemia associated with FOB to occur in a small minority (1.8%), and led to mechanical ventilation in only 2% of that group. 52 The overall low rate of intubation in the HCT and neutropenic patients suggests that a low incidence of procedure-related hypoxemia may be an acceptable risk. 52, [56] [57] [58] In practice, myriad challenges face providers in determining the appropriate timing of FOB in HM and HCT patients, many of whom are too sick to undergo conscious sedation or general anesthesia for a diagnostic procedure. Provider preference has also been shown to be a barrier to FOB independent of clinical status, 59, 60 and delay in diagnosis may have less to do with respiratory status than with physician choice. 61 Based on autopsy studies, PC diagnoses remain elusive before death in many HCT subjects, [12] [13] [14] suggesting that a 'wait and see' approach to empiric therapy is used commonly. As a result of these differences, rigorous study is difficult and there is limited prospective evidence on which to base decisions regarding optimal timing, modality, yield or impact of FOB on outcomes in these populations.

Using mostly retrospective data, the overall range for yield of FOB in HM and HCT is wide, from 30% to 67%. 15, [56] [57] [58] [62] [63] [64] [65] Diagnostic yield may correlate with anatomic location and with radiographic patterns. For example, BAL return in the setting of reticular/nodular infiltrates is generally lower as compared with BAL performed in regions with hazy ground glass or consolidation. 42, 66 FOB yield may be highest for multifocal infections, such as P jirovecii pneumonia, and lowest for mycobacterial or fungal etiologies. 67 Diagnostic yield may also be higher in febrile or symptomatic patients as compared with those who are asymptomatic. 57, 66 In a retrospective review of 501 nonintubated allogeneic HCT recipients with new pulmonary infiltrates during the first 100 days after HCT, the diagnostic yield of FOB more than doubled during the first 4 days after symptom onset. 57 This same study showed a diagnostic yield of 75% if performed within 24 hours before the initiation of antimicrobials, and other studies suggest that optimal yield can still be achieved if FOB is performed within 1 to 3 days of the initiation of therapy. 58, 68, 69 Empirical antimicrobial therapy before lung sampling is an unavoidable reality in many high-risk patients and may reduce diagnostic yield for invasive fungal disease, in particular. 70 Accordingly, the yield of diagnostic FOB may be least in patients who would most greatly benefit from early treatment guidance, including critically ill HCT recipients 54 and those who have acute graft-versus-host disease. 71 The importance of diagnostic yield lies in its direct impact on management, and on its indirect impact on PC-related outcomes, such as mortality. Although few studies have rigorously evaluated the impact of FOB on patient management or mortality using prospective methods, available data suggest that early FOB is more likely to provide a diagnosis (especially bacterial) upon which changes in management can be made. 72 FOB-guided changes in antimicrobial therapy have been reported in 20% to 70% of HM and HCT recipients, 52, 54, 57, 58, 62, 65, 73, 74 including withdrawal of antimicrobial agents in nearly one-half of HCT subjects. 52, 58 FOB results may also provide critical insight into the management of resistant pathogens. In 1 study, pathogens detected in BAL alone demonstrated antimicrobial resistance profiles integral to management, thus rendering inappropriate the choice of empiric therapy based on antimicrobial profiles identified in upper respiratory or peripheral specimens. 64 However, diagnostic yield may not always correlate with a change in management, as demonstrated in neutropenic intensive care unit patients, where a 50% diagnostic yield had little impact on treatment changes. 65 The impact of diagnostic FOB on PC-related survival is also unclear. Several retrospective, singlecenter studies suggest that FOB has no discernible influence on mortality. 56, 65, 75 Although a prospective multicenter study of critically ill cancer patients, including a subset of HCT recipients, did not find FOB to influence mortality, FOB performed within 4 days of symptom onset was associated with a significant survival advantage at 30 days compared with subjects who underwent late FOB-associated antibiotic changes. 57 Another study showed FOBdriven changes in antimicrobial management within 7 days of presentation to be associated with lower mortality compared with patients in whom change was instituted beyond 1 week. 58 Thus, an inability to target treatment expediently may contribute to poor outcomes. Diagnostic delay or a lack of diagnosis has been shown to independently predict death in immunosuppressed hosts with pulmonary infiltrates, highest in critically ill HCT recipients and those with FN. 15, 76 This finding highlights the importance of obtaining a correct microbiological diagnosis in the compromised patient, when possible. 77 Recommended approach to diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy As a guiding principle, diagnostic FOB should be considered in the HM or HCT subject upon presentation with a new infiltrate on diagnostic chest imaging, and/or in the absence of clinical or radiographic response to at least 48 to 72 hours of empiric antimicrobial therapy (see Fig. 3 ). In the event that empiric therapy is instituted before sampling, whether based on the acuity of patient illness or high suspicion for opportunistic illness, timely investigation is critical to optimize yield and avoid masking a partially treated infection. If the clinical decision is to observe the effects of empiric therapy before lung sampling, this period should be limited to just a few days. The use of systematic institutional protocols for FOB in compromised hosts may be considered. 78 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 351, "end": 354, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 355, "end": 359, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 360, "end": 364, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 365, "end": 369, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 370, "end": 374, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 375, "end": 379, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 380, "end": 384, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 385, "end": 389, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 650, "end": 653, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 654, "end": 656, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 791, "end": 793, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 910, "end": 913, "text": "57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 914, "end": 916, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1150, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1409, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1413, "text": "68,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1416, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1601, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1772, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1827, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2248, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2355, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2359, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2363, "text": "57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2367, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2371, "text": "62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2372, "end": 2375, "text": "65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2379, "text": "73,", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2380, "end": 2382, "text": "74", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2467, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2468, "end": 2470, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2824, "end": 2826, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 3037, "end": 3039, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3213, "end": 3216, "text": "56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 3217, "end": 3220, "text": "65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3221, "end": 3223, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 3565, "end": 3567, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3771, "end": 3773, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 4058, "end": 4061, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 4062, "end": 4064, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 4196, "end": 4198, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 5039, "end": 5041, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4536, "end": 4542, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Overview of fiberoptic bronchoscopy"}, {"text": "There is controversy regarding the usefulness of lung biopsy in HM and HCT subjects. For some providers, BAL has historically been considered sufficient for diagnosis 65, 79 ; for others, the improved yield of combined BAL and TBLB as compared with BAL alone can also be justified by low reported complication rates. 80, 81 In a more recent metaanalysis, similar rates of diagnosis were found in studies of BAL and lung biopsy from HCT recipients, although infection was identified more commonly from BAL and noninfectious etiologies were picked up on biopsy. 60 Upon suspicion of invasive fungal or viral infection, however, TBLB may improve diagnostic yield over BAL alone. 81 Overall, however, the impact of TBLB on management remains unclear. 82 As an alternative to TBLB, CT-guided transthoracic lung biopsy may be preferred for sampling peripheral lung lesions (unless BAL would be contributory) and can be high yield in the HM or HCT patient. 42 A specificity of 100% for diagnosis of invasive fungal disease using CT-guided sampling has been reported. 83 There is an increased risk of pneumothorax using this approach as compared with TBLB; thus, it is important to choose a large enough nodule for improved sampling yield in the face of elevated procedural risk. 42 Surgical lung biopsy (SLB), whether open or video assisted, is generally kept as a last resort owing to increased procedural risk. Although TBLB, transthoracic lung biopsy, and SLB have not be compared head to head, the decision to proceed to SLB generally follows a nondiagnostic TBLB or an unrelenting course despite empiric therapy. 67 In a retrospective study from our institution, open lung biopsy in HM subjects demonstrated a specific diagnosis in 62%, led to a change in management in 69%, and correlated with an improved overall survival. 84 Although the diagnostic yield of SLB can be high, 85 its impact on management is difficult to ascertain, and associated mortality limits SLB as a first-line diagnostic modality in transplant recipients. Furthermore, SLB has been on the decrease in recent years as diagnostics for invasive fungal disease improve. 86 Diagnostic testing of lung specimens Table 3 summarizes the applications of assays to lung specimens for the diagnosis of infectious PCs. Culture-dependent and -independent methods for identifying common respiratory pathogens and opportunistic organisms in bronchoscopic specimens are similar to those applied to upper respiratory specimens; however, their interpretation requires caution. Contamination of LRT specimens by oral and upper airway flora or colonizers needs to be considered when interpreting the results of microbiological investigations in BAL. Furthermore, the identification of a potential pathogen, such as cytomegalovirus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or fungal antigen, such as beta-D glucan, in BAL, does not always imply causation, emphasizing the importance of clinical context in the interpretation of results. BAL cytology continues to be useful to suggest processes involving tissue invasion (such as P jirovecii pneumonia and cytomegalovirus disease) in the absence of biopsy specimens, and may also identify malignant cells (eg, lymphoma), hemorrhage, and alveolar proteinosis. BAL cell count is generally nonspecific, although it may be useful in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or organizing pneumonia. Lung tissue histopathology is important not only for definitive diagnosis of invasive fungal or viral infections, but also malignancy, organizing pneumonia, and interstitial diseases associated with drug toxicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 170, "text": "65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 171, "end": 173, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 317, "end": 320, "text": "80,", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 321, "end": 323, "text": "81", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 560, "end": 562, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 676, "end": 678, "text": "81", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 747, "end": 749, "text": "82", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 950, "end": 952, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1062, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1274, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1613, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1825, "text": "84", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1878, "text": "85", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2141, "text": "86", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2179, "end": 2186, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Consideration of lung biopsy"}, {"text": "Early diagnosis of PCs is challenging owing to heterogeneous patient, clinical, and provider factors. A delay in PC diagnosis limits the opportunity for targeted treatment, which may contribute to poor outcomes. Thus, an integrated clinicoradiologic approach can provide crucial insight into the nature of PCs, and provide guidance for further diagnostic testing in HM and HCT patients. Although controversy persists, available data suggest an advantage to early FOB in terms of diagnostic yield, targeted management, and mortality for high-risk HM and HCT recipients, perhaps with exception in the critically ill population. A low threshold for minimally invasive lung sampling should therefore be a guiding principle in highrisk patients, including those with FN and recipients of HCT. This practice may become especially important as advances are made in the sensitivity and specificity of next-generation sequencing applications for infectious disease diagnosis. Empirical treatment is important for the neutropenic or febrile patient presenting with signs or symptoms of pneumonia, however FOB within 72 hours of intubation and empiric treatment is nonetheless encouraged. After careful assessment of risk, lung biopsy via TBLB or transthoracic lung biopsy should be considered when there is concern for invasive fungal or viral disease and in the absence of supportive data from noninvasive sources. SLB should be reserved for cases where diagnoses remain elusive despite investigations of BAL or lung tissue obtain via minimally invasive modalities, and where increased procedural risk is warranted in favor of diagnostic results that would impact key aspects of management.
