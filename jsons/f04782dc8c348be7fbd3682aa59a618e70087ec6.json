            "text": "Selenium is an essential immunonutrient which holds the human's metabolic activity with its chemical bonds. The organic forms of selenium naturally present in human body are selenocysteine and selenoproteins. These forms have a unique way of synthesis and translational coding. Selenoproteins act as antioxidant warriors for thyroid regulation, male-fertility enhancement, and anti-inflammatory actions. They also participate indirectly in the mechanism of wound healing as oxidative stress reducers. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is the major selenoprotein present in the human body, which assists in the control of excessive production of free radical at the site of inflammation. Other than GPX, other selenoproteins include selenoprotein-S that regulates the inflammatory cytokines and selenoprotein-P that serves as an inducer of homeostasis. Previously, reports were mainly focused on the cellular and molecular mechanism of wound healing with reference to various animal models and cell lines. In this review, the role of selenium and its possible routes in translational decoding of selenocysteine, synthesis of selenoproteins, systemic action of selenoproteins and their indirect assimilation in the process of wound healing are explained in detail. Some of the selenium containing compounds which can acts as cancer preventive and therapeutics are also discussed. These compounds directly or indirectly exhibit antioxidant properties which can sustain the intracellular redox status and these activities protect the healthy cells from reactive oxygen species induced oxidative damage. Although the review covers the importance of selenium/selenoproteins in wound healing process, still some unresolved mystery persists which may be resolved in near future.",

Selenium was discovered by Swedish chemist Jons Jacob Berzelius in the year 1817 and it was named after the ancient Greek word 'Selene' which refers to Moon. Selenium is a reactive nonmetal or metalloid located in P Block, Period IV and Group 16 of the Mendeleev's periodic table of elements. Selenium originates from Sulfide ore which partially replaces the Sulphur in certain reactions since it possesses similar physical and chemical properties of Sulphur (Meija et al. 2016) . Selenium is an amorphous brick red powder and when it reaches its melting point, it tends to turn into its black vitreous form. It has six different isotopes with varied stabilization states, half-life and mode of decay. Selenium exists in two different forms, namely organic and inorganic. Organic forms of selenium are present as selenocysteine and selenomethionine in human body. Inorganic forms such as selenite and selenate get accumulated in plants through soil. Selenium has the ability to combine with other minerals and elements of Sulphide, Copper, Silver, Nickel and Lead. Selenium holds the 67th rank for the most abundant element on the Earth's crust (USEPA 2014) .",

The level of Se concentration in plants differs by the type of soil, level of accumulation capacity, pH, salinity, organic matter, redox reactions, and type of plant species. Excessive accumulation of selenium in plants leads to toxicity (Draho\u0148ovsk\u00fd et al. 2014 ). The selenium content in soil differs globally and when it is compared with other nations, the Indian and European soils possess less selenium (Rayman 2008) .

All these proteins have selenocysteine residue in their primary predefined structure (Kryukov et al. 2003 ). Selenium has a specific protein synthesis pathway where its codes for the 21st amino acid called UGA Codon; this process is called as Translational Decoding (Bubenik et al. 2014 ). These selenoproteins are responsible for function and regulation of thyroid hormones, regulators of growth, development and differentiation, inhibitors of non-specific immune response, neutralisers of inflammatory, chemotactic and phagocytic responses like anti-male sterility, reproduction and oxidative stress influencer (Schomburg 2012; Dentice et al. 2013; Pascual and Aranda 2013; Effraimidis and Wiersinga 2014; Zubair et al. 2015; Chan et al. 2016 ). Role of selenium in human body is important and crucial in stabilising and neutralising the body metabolism. During wound healing process, certain selenoproteins like GPX-1, GPX-4, selenoprotein S and selenoprotein P combine to perform various reactions such as antioxidant activities, inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and elimination of Peroxynitrate (a super radical ion) in inflammatory phase (Lei et al. 2009; Cox et al. 2013; Talbi et al. 2019) .",

A wound is defined as disruption or damage to the normal cells which changes the anatomical structure and function. Wounds can be classified according to their shape, depth and infection (Coupland 1992) . The Centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) categorised the surgical wounds into three types by clean, contaminated, and infected. Primarily the wound is classified into three types (1) acute (2) chronic and (3) complicated. Acute wounds heal themselves in accordance with proper duration and follows orderly healing pathway; the duration of healing normally ranges either from 5 to 10 days nor within a month. Chronic wounds are wounds that cannot be restored normally by healing pathway; they have irregular duration and prolonged process like infection, necrosis, hypoxia, and higher amount of inflammatory cytokine release. The combination of tissue disintegration and infection is termed to be complicated wound. For example: tumor cell in a complicated region such as brain, oesophagus, uterus, etc. (Lazarus et al. 1994; Bischoff et al. 1999) .",

The skin protects the body from pathogens, harmful rays, foreign invaders, and oxidative stress. Apart from that, it also possesses functions like maintaining the body temperature, immunological reactions, regulations of specific metabolic reactions, and many signalling activities. An injury starts with tissue disintegration followed by bleeding which helps to flush out the blood containing microbes and foreign particles. Immediately the clotting factors trigger the phases of coagulation and haemostasis which leads to platelet aggregation and fibrinogen formation (Martin et al. 1997; Sen 2009 ). The inflammatory phase which deals with cellular and vascular responses usually starts within few minutes of the injury and lasts up to 24 h. In migration phase, the epithelial cells and fibroblasts migrate towards the injured area to replace the disintegrated, damaged cells and tissues. On day 3, the proliferation phase starts with granulation for tissue formation, synthesis of lymphatic vessels, synthesis of collagen by fibroblasts, and maximum formation of blood vessels and tissues. The final phase of wound healing is said to be maturation or remodelling which involves the regeneration of cellular connective tissues and strengthening of the new epithelium. This prolonged process may take months to 2 years to recover fully (Velnar et al. 2009 ). As discussed above, certain selenoproteins act as antioxidants as well as inducers during specific phases of wound healing process. In this review, we try to elucidate some of the possible routes in which selenoproteins participate in wound healing mechanism.",

The major physiological role of selenium in plant is to prevent oxidative stress, phytoremediation, biofortification, etc. Plants are classified into two major types based on the level of selenium accumulation. Certain plants grown in selenium enriched soil tend to accumulate high levels of the element; they are called as hyper accumulators or Se-tolerant plants. The plants that do not accumulate selenium are known as hypo accumulators or Se-Sensitive plants Yu and Gu 2013; Alfthan et al. 2015; El-Ramady et al. 2015) . The major plant species that are hyper accumulators come under the families of Brassicaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae (L\u00e4uchli 1993) . These hyper accumulator plants store organic forms of selenium such as methyl-SeCysteine and selenocysteine, whereas hypo accumulators store inorganic selenium (De Souza et al. 1998) . The physiological cycle of plant uptake and accumulation of selenium is clearly shown in Fig. 1 .",

Some species of plants metabolise selenomethionine into volatile dimethylselenide (DMSe) which helps to reduce toxicity (Terry et al. 2000) . With the help of Sec selenocysteine Lyase, the selenocysteine gets converted to elemental selenium and Alanine (Domokos-Szabolcsy et al. 2012) . Methylation process takes place when selenocysteine gets converted into Se-Cystathionine by Cystathionine gamma synthase and Ortho-Phospho Hemoserine (OPH) coupling.

The initial metabolism starts by ingesting the selenomethionine (SeMet) via food or supplements. The SeMet absorbed through intestinal transport channels, reaches the Methionine pool. The major function of Methionine pool is to store selenomethionine and simultaneously incorporate them into proteins replacing the position of Methionine and forming selenomethionine. One of the reports reveals that \"the ratio of 1 selenium atom (SeMet) per 8000 Methionine residues is equivalent to 1 selenomethionine per 1100 albumin molecules\" (Burk 2001) . The selenomethionine travels through Methionine cycle and Transsulphuration pathways (mostly in liver). The selenomethionine undergoes transsulphuration to produce selenocysteine and further with the help of Sec Lyase it tends to form selenide (Martin and Hurlbut 1976; Esaki et al. 1982) . During dietary intake, the consumption of selenocysteine is comparatively low than selenomethionine resulting in highly reactive selenocysteine (Sec). These are maintained at low concentration whereas the less reactive selenomethionine (SeMet) is highly metabolised (Suzuki 2005) . In liver, methyl selenol is produced as a result of \u03b1-lyase activity, and this methyl selenol in turn gets demethylated to form selenide (Suzuki et al. 2006 ). The major reported biological function of selenomethionine is to produce derivatives of selenium as well as to store selenomethionine for further synthesis of selenoproteins. The final step in the metabolism of selenium is the conversion of SeMet to Sec through Transsulphuration pathway followed by biosynthesis of selenoproteins (Labunskyy et al. 2014 ). The pathway for initial metabolism of selenium is partially explained in Fig. 2 .",

            "text": "In the year 1985, the cloning of GPX1 leads to the discovery of UGA which is a stop codon for Sec during regular translational process (Chambers et al. 1986 ). Sec is a recently explored eukaryotic amino acid which directly encodes into proteins forming the 21st amino acid. The mechanism of translational decoding or otherwise called as biosynthesis of selenoproteins is shown in Fig. 3 . During translational decoding, UGA codon is one among the three stop codons which works for mRNA in which tRNA for selenocysteine (tRNA Sec ) recognizes and attaches to the respective codon (Buettner et al. 1999) . Helper amino acid Serine conjugates with tRNA Sec by seryl-tRNA sythetase which is further phosphorylated into phosphoserine by an enzyme phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase (Ganyc et al. 2006) . After the initial metabolism of selenium, the dietary selenium gets phosphorylated by selenophosphate synthase 2 (SPS2) which is then conjugated with phosphoserine by selenocysteine synthase to produce selenocysteine (Chen and Berry 2003) . All eukaryotic selenoprotein genes require selenocysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS) element in 3\u2032 UTR of the mRNA for recoding of UGA stop codon for Sec insertion. The unique stem loop structure of SECIS is the binding site of selenocysteine incorporation sequence binding protein 2 (SPB2) (B\u00f6ck et al. 1991) . The RNA binding domain of SPB2 (SECIS binding protein 2) belongs to L7Ae riboprotein family. SPB2 is a complex protein containing minimum of five isomers which splices alternatively around 17-19 possible exons (Papp et al. 2008) . The location and functions of different selenoproteins is detailed in Table 4 . Other factors include specialized elongation factor (EFsec) that gets bound to tRNA Sec for an extra protein binding support system (Squires and Berry 2008) . The assembly of certain factors and cofactors on selenoprotein mRNA leads to the decoding of UGA into Sec via translational decoding process (De Jesus et al. 2006 ). Oxidation of SPB2 in nucleus gets reduced by nuclear specific GPX and Thioredoxin reductases (TRXR) proteins followed by CRM-1 dependent nuclear transport (Sneddon et al. 2003) . Cofactors which contribute during the synthesis of selenoproteins are SECp43 as tRNA Sec binding protein and the chaperone protein which binds to SECIS element and plays a role in protein translation (Shen et al. 2006) . Another SECIS element binding protein is said to be nuclease sensitive element-binding protein 1 (NSEP1) which binds during the synthesis of selenoproteins via ribosomal pathway (Allmang et al. 2009 ). Translational decoding of selenoproteins gives idea on the importance of selenium in human metabolism and health. The selenoproteins synthesis processes such as translational decoding of selenocysteine, locations and their transport are shown in Figs. 3 and 4.",

            "text": "When an injury occurs, the platelets start to aggregate and form thrombi at the wounded area. Meanwhile, the immune cells release the pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophils which produce huge amounts of reactive oxidative species (ROS) like hydrogen peroxidases (HP) and lipid peroxidases (LP). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the substances that are formed as a natural byproduct and have important roles in cell signalling and homeostasis. However, during times of environmental stress (e.g., UV or heat exposure), ROS levels can increase dramatically which may result in significant damage to cell structures and cumulatively-this is known as oxidative stress. During inflammation, Matrix Metaprotease (MMP), HP, metal scavengers and LP are released, resulting in higher expression levels of NOX2 gene in plasma membrane of cells and NOX2 gets activated during phagocytosis leading to production of superoxide radicals (Sen and Roy 2008; Gill and Parks 2008) . Glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) of selenoprotein family play a major role in the wound healing process. Glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) are known as the family of antioxidants. There are eight types of GPXs with diverse characteristics and properties such as chemical forms, location, functions and modes of action (Brigelius-Flohe and Maiorino 2013). Out of eight isoforms of GPXs, five have a SeCys residue in their side chains which helps to catalyse the hydrogen peroxidases, lipid peroxidases and heavy metals. Glutathione (GSH) reduces disulphide bonds formed within cytoplasmic proteins to cysteine by serving as an electron donor. In the process, glutathione is converted to its oxidised form, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), also called l-(\u2212)-glutathione (Takeda 2015) . GPXs detoxify the hydrogen peroxide into peroxidases to avoid Fenton's reaction or Haber-Weiss reaction (several metals have a special oxygen transfer property which improve the use of hydrogen peroxide and some metals have a strong catalytic power to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals). It has been observed that during inflammatory process a strong mRNA expression of GPX 1 was found which helps in the wound healing (Bedard and Krause 2007; Steiling et al. 1999) . Later researchers state that there is a decreased level of GPX 1 during early wounded phase resulting in the reduction of its activity in wounded control and immune-compromised rats (Iuchi et al. 2010 ). It has been reported that alkylation or nitric oxide dependent oxidation of selenocysteine results in reduction of GPXs activity (Gupta et al. 2002) . Excess of hydrogen peroxide and super oxide dismutase (SOD) causes the selenocysteine to get converted into dehydrolalanine, which results in irreversible inactivation and degradation (You et al. 2010 ).",

Other reports state that Endoplasmic Reticulum stress induces the Sel S expression by ER stress response element via nuclear factor (NF)-kb pathway (Gao et al. 2006) . The depletion of Sel S by siRNA increases the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, concluding that Sel S may regulate the cytokine production in macrophages and plays a major role in controlling the inflammatory responses. A particular polymorphism of Sel S was proven to be responsible for increased plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokines. Sel S gene has been linked to variant markers of inflammation and one among the particular variant is 105G-A (Curran et al. 2005) . The role of Sel S in the inflammatory response may be correlated with the inflammation phase of the wound healing mechanism. But still these assumptions can be solved in future with more experimental evidences. The assumptions are shown in Fig. 5 .",

The compound produced noticeable anti-proliferative activities against three oral cancer cell lines (HSC-3, HSC-4, and SAS) at a concentration of 5-100 \u00b5M on treatment for 2-5 days (Endo et al. 2017) . Sodium selenite was found to be efficiently inhibiting the cell proliferation of several types of cancer cells even the deadliest cancer in worldwide, the lung cancer cells too (Tan et al. 2018 ). Among different human cancer cell lines tested, lung cancer cells, in general, appeared to be especially sensitive to selenite (Berthier et al. 2017; Lipinski 2017; Chen et al. 2018a, b) . Previous reports showed that selenite cytotoxicity at concentration of 5 \u00b5M for treatment of 5 h was correlated with selenium uptake of three lung cancer cell lines (H157, H611, and U2020) and it results indicated that at high concentrations (> 1 mM) of selenate was found to be non-toxic for these cell lines (Olm et al. 2009 ). Selenite played a key role in natural killer (NK) cell-based anticancer immunotherapy where it could raise the susceptibility of cancer cells to CD94/NK group 2A-positive NK cells, and it showed positive clinical applications to lung cancer patients (Enqvist et al. 2011 ). On reduction of sodium selenite to hydrogen selenide which is the common intermediate of dietary selenium metabolism might activate the apoptosis of cancer cells (HepG2, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells) through accumulation in mitochondria, this might then damage mitochondrial function and structure which lead to cell death (Hu et al. 2018) . In general most of the inorganic selenium compounds exhibit higher genotoxic stress, which account for lower therapeutic value, higher systemic toxicity and an increased risk of tumour burden.",

Their cytotoxic effects were found to be in the low to medium \u00b5m range for lung, breast, cervical, liver cancer cells and also in melanoma cells. Cytotoxicity of selenocystine is due to increased ROS production which induces DNA damage and leads to mitochondrial mediated apoptosis associated with p53 phosphorylation. In addition to these cytotoxic mechanisms selenocystine exhibited the extrinsic/death-receptor pathway in melanoma cells (Chen and Wong 2008) . In another study selenocystine treatment in cervical cancer cells has been related with two different types of cell death via apoptotic and paraptotic-like associated with ER stress which leads to induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Wallenberg et al. 2014 ). Selenocystine inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of melanoma with no signs of systemic toxicity. Further, selenocystine and auranofin exhibited a synergistic effect on inducing apoptosis in a mouse xenograft model of lung cancer (Fan et al. 2014) . Selenocystine on administration in humans for acute and chronic myeloid leukemia treatment worked remarkably, particularly effective against immature leucocytes with respect to mature leucocytes and also without bringing any significant effect on the bone marrow (Weisberger and Suhrland 1956) .",

The in vitro cytotoxicity of this compound has been found out to be in micromolar (\u00b5m) range for many human cancer cell lines which includes colon, breast, lung and oral squamous cells. Furthermore, Methylselenocysteine treatment in in vitro has also shown to decrease vascular endothelial growth factor expression (Suzuki et al. 2010a, b) . Moreover, the mechanisms by which Methylselenocysteine treatment causing cell death has been associated with role for caspasedependent pathway and to extent of mitochondrial signalling involvement in this process still remains unclear (Kim et al. 2001; Suzuki et al. 2008; Schr\u00f6terov\u00e1 et al. 2009 ). Methylselenocysteine treatment in mice bearing FaDu human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma xenografts has caused series of promising antiangiogenic effects, tumor growth inhibition, enhanced doxorubicin delivery associated with decreased microvessel density, improved vascular maturation, better vessel functionality and decreased vascular permeability (Bhattacharya et al. 2008) . Similarly, a synergistic effect on tumor growth inhibition by Methylselenocysteine and tamoxifen was detected in a mouse xenograft model of MCF-7 breast cancer ). In another study a similar synergistic effect of Methylselenocysteine and irinotecan was witnessed in mouse xenograft models of colon carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

Ethaselen, through thioredoxin reductase inhibitory effect arrest the cell growth S phase and thereby the proliferation of tumor cells was inhibited (Shi et al. 2003) . Concurrently, ethaselen established promising outcomes in in vivo experiments, with tumor inhibitory effects in the range of 40-80% in prostate, tongue and liver cancer models (Xing et al. 2008; Tan et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2012) . Ethaselen in combination with cisplatin (cis-diamine dichloroplatinum II, DDP) in a lung xenograft mouse model showed significant synergistic reduction of tumor size, with no evident signs of systemic or organ toxicity . Combination of cisplatin and ethaselen produced similar results in a leukemic cisplatin resistant cell line with substantial synergistic effects. Ethaselen with Sunitinib (multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor) combination has exhibited similar synergistic effects against spreading of colorectal cancer cells (Zheng et al. 2016) . In spite of ethaselen encouraging anticancer activity, its solubility in physiological media is not ideal, thus preventing its application without appropriate formulation. Copolymer micelles have helped in increasing ethaselen water solubility which led to enhanced antitumor activity and attribute to massive accumulation at the tumor site ). Currently ethaselen is in Phase I clinical trials in patients with non-small cell carcinoma (NSLCLC). Tolerable and safe dose in the Ia/b phase was found to be 1200 mg/day (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02166242).",

It was shown initially that this compound possesses a noticeable antitumor activity against murine melanoma cancers in in vitro and animal models. It is also likely to exhibit anticancer activity against human promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro at nanomolar levels (Lucas et al. 1983; Boritzki et al. 1985) . Later there are reports on selenazofurin dinucleotides analogues which are found to be more effective than the mononucleotide precursor (Gebeyehu et al. 1985) . A new analog called selenophenfurin was developed by replacing selenazole ring with selenophene heterocycle. They are found to be effective against leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumor cell lines at concentrations alike that of selenazofurin (Franchetti et al. 1997) .

In specific, phenylalkyl selenocyanates revealed to be effective in in vitro conditions for various cancer cell lines like melanoma, glioblastoma, sarcoma, prostate, breast, and colon. The same compound in in vivo condition was capable of reducing the tumour growth significantly in a melanoma xenograft model, without causing any systemic toxicity or affecting the blood related parameters. The compound was able to affect cancer cell redox state by assessing its cycle in the presence of GSH forming nitric oxide, superoxide and other ROS (Crampsie et al. 2012 ). There are reports additionally that they effects specific phase II detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes like glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase and catalase and also selenoenzymes like thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase (Das et al. 2013 ). These mechanistic conditions in cells lead to caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death via induction of p53, Bax and suppression of Bcl-2 (Chakraborty et al. 2015) . The compound 2-[5-selenocyanato-pentyl]-7-amino benzo [de] isoquinoline-1,3-dione which is the combined form of diphenyl-methylselenocyanate and naphthalimide were found to possess effective therapeutic efficacy than the classical chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. Report on the adverse and toxicity effect exhibited by the classical chemotherapeutic drugs has been reduced by this compound (Ghosh et al. 2015) . The synthetic compound 1,4-phenylenebis (methylene) selenocyanate (p-XSC) has been found to be effective in in vitro even at low micromolar concentrations against androgen responsive and androgen unresponsive human prostate cancers. They does the activity by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, stimulating JNK, p38, ERKs 1&2 and Akt cancer cell signalling and preventing the m-TOR downstream effectors (Facompre et al. 2012) .",

Between them, chemical synthesis is considered the most common method to prepare selenium nanoparticles. In chemical synthesis, selenium in the form of selenite, selenious acid, or selenium dioxide were frequently used as precursors, reducing agents like ascorbic acid and glutathione are employed and stabilizing agents like chitosan and pectin helps in the selenium nanoparticles formation and maintenance (Qiu et al. 2018; Zhai et al. 2017) .

For optimize their function, the chemically synthesized selenium nanoparticles are usually decorated with other bioactive molecules which can enhance the therapeutic effects upon certain types of cancers when compared with non-decorated selenium nanoparticles. Apart from direct therapeutic effects, chemically altered selenium nanoparticles can act as vehicles that endow the carried objects with favourable properties like low toxicity, high efficacy and tumor targeting. Markedly, chemically synthesized selenium nanoparticles were also observed as diagnostic agents, imaging mediators, and radio-sensitizers (Yang et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018a, b; Zhao et al. 2018a, b; Abd-Rabou et al. 2019 ).",

Particularly its role in the synthesis of various types of selenoproteins and many regulatory metabolic pathways starting from the plant source to human's mechanistic approach. Throughout the years, many novel selenoproteins have been identified and annotated its importance in various aspects. This review is mainly focused on some of the functions of selenoproteins and their part in wound healing mechanism. Some of the predictable or possible routes like translational decoding of selenocysteine, biosynthesis of selenoproteins, systemic action of selenoproteins and their direct or indirect assimilation of selenoproteins in the process of wound healing are discussed. In near future those predicted routes can be experimentally proved and may help in resolve the mystery about the role of selenium in wound healing process. Selenium compounds have been reasonably beneficial in cancer treatment and diagnosis. Recent day's selenium nanoparticle has attracted considerable attention against various types of cancers. They will be playing critical role in cancer prevention and therapy in the near future. Many new selenium drugs pertaining to inflammations and other deficiencies/ diseases may also arise to prove the importance of selenium to the medical and pharmaceutical world.",
