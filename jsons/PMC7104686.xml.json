Contact tracing relies on other concurrent aspects of the COVID-19 containment strategies such as investigating, classifying, tracking, and managing contacts by identifying the patient\u2019s route. A mathematical model predicted that highly effective contact tracing and quarantine was sufficient enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 in most scenarios [6]. In Korea, various tracking measures such as the history of clinic visits, GPS of cell phones, credit card transaction logs, and CCTV have been used to complete the contact tracing of COVID-19 cases [7].",

Following the increase in the number of cases above 30, the strategy shifted from containment to mitigation, which is now applied in many parts of the world. Secondly, potential risk factors such as the characteristics of a household and other transmission routes were not assessed and would merit further study.
