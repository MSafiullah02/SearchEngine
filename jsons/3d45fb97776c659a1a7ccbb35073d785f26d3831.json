The intertwining complexity of these pathogens with their diverse tissue tropisms, direct effects on host cells, multiphasic immunological responses, and additional influence of superimposed secondary agents is beyond the expertise of any single discipline in modern medicine. A combined evaluation of patient's history, clinical manifestations, and physical examination may suggest a list of differential diagnosis, but it is often insufficient to determine the specific infectious etiology. Laboratory methods are essential to identify an etiologic agent from testing clinical samples, such as blood, serum, nasopharyngeal swab, etc. These methods, including traditional microbiological techniques, conventional immunological assays, and modern molecular methods, remain the mainstay in today's practice of clinical microbiology and infectious disease medicine. Nevertheless, there are technical and logistic issues associated with these methods, and the test results often lack a clinicopathologic correlation that can confound the interpretation of their clinical significance. For example, microbiological culture may fail to grow a causative organism, while the organism isolated by the laboratory in vitro may arise from contamination and does not represent the actual infective agent in vivo.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Pathology plays a key role as a bridging subspecialty in such multidisciplinary approach. Pathologic examination, if available, can establish a more specific diagnosis correlated with clinical manifestations. Although general practice of pathology is largely oriented toward diagnosis of neoplastic diseases, pathologists have been increasingly called upon to make diagnoses from tissue samples collected by cytology, biopsy, and autopsy procedures in response to the challenge of emerging infections [1] [2] [3] [4] . Using these tissue samples as the source for laboratory workup, pathologists have made various contributions to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases in diagnostics, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical aspects of these diseases (Table 1 ). In addition, results from pathologic studies can help design better strategies for control and prevention of these emerging infectious diseases, especially when they occur as an outbreak [5, 6] . Furthermore, pathologic studies also play an essential role in identifying the effects of secondary pathogens that commonly complicate the primary disease syndrome [7, 8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 501, "end": 504, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 505, "end": 508, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 509, "end": 512, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 513, "end": 516, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 963, "end": 966, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 967, "end": 969, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1139, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1142, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 764, "end": 772, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Recent advances in molecular biology have revolutionized the practice of medicine, especially in the arena of diagnostic pathology and laboratory medicine [9] [10] [11] . The practice of pathology has evolved from using morphologic pattern recognition as the main tool to a sophisticated medical subspecialty by applying a wide array of advanced immunologic and molecular techniques on top of the traditional methods. The so-called traditional methods include routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, histochemical (special) stain, and electron microscopy (EM). The more commonly used advanced techniques include immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR), and tissue microarrays. Other advanced techniques that are less standardized as diagnostic utilities for infectious diseases include confocal microscopy, proteomics, laser capture microdissection (LCM), in situ PCR, pyrosequencing, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results from these techniques provide different information regarding the infectious agents in the organ systems they involve (Table 2) . Each technique has its respective advantages and limitations, and there is no single technique that can stand alone as the only method for etiologic diagnosis. The advanced techniques complement the traditional methods to confirm the diagnosis; therefore, it is always necessary to apply these techniques as an integrated laboratory utility to take full advantage of the pathology approach. A good example to illustrate such approach is the identification of a novel coronavirus during the global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . By using traditional culture (Fig. 1a) and EM examinations (Fig. 1b) on clinical samples and tissue specimens, the morphologic evidence of coronavirus leads to subsequent anatomic localization of this novel virus in lung tissues by using a combination of IHC (Fig. 1c) , ISH (Fig. 1d) , and PCR. Ultimately, correlations of these data with serological and clinical findings confirmed the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiologic pathogen of the outbreak. This is a prime example of the contributions made by infectious disease pathology as part of a multidisciplinary approach to investigate emerging infections and disease outbreaks.

Although it cannot highlight the pathogen per se, microscopic examination of H&E-stained slides is the most unequivocal method to illustrate the evidence of a microbial infection and its consequence in the tissue. For example, the presence of abundant neutrophils in the pulmonary alveoli is indicative of pneumonia (Fig. 2a) , while neutrophils in the meninges support the diagnosis of meningitis. In some instances, the histopathologic features may be suggestive of infection caused by a specific pathogen; for example, the presence of smudge cells with necrotizing pneumonitis is indicative of an adenovirus infection in the lung. Nevertheless, most of the histopathologic findings shown by H&E stain are not specific because they can be caused by a variety of organisms. Their importance is to pave the first step leading to further laboratory assays for detecting the causative agent.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 597, "end": 606, "text": "(Fig. 2a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Hematoxylin and Eosin Stain"}, {"text": "Many histochemical stains have been developed to highlight a variety of microbial organisms.

Interpretation of these special stains performed on tissue sections is usually more difficult than those performed on cultures because the coexistence of host tissue responses and accompanied histopathologic changes in the sections can confound the interpretation. It needs more expertise and effort to examine these special stains and usually requires a trained pathologist to carry out such examination. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae can appear as gram-negative cocci in tissue sections because the host inflammatory responses, antibiotic treatment, or autolysin produced by the bacteria per se can damage the bacterial cell wall and render the Gram stain appear negative. Even when these special stains properly highlight organisms of interest, they can only categorize them within a broad classification but not a specific species. For example, gram-positive cocci demonstrated by tissue Gram stain in a lung section (Fig. 2b) could represent different species of Streptococci or Staphylococci, and further testing with more specific assays is needed to reveal the true identity of these cocci.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1358, "end": 1367, "text": "(Fig. 2b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Histochemical Stains (Special Stains)"}, {"text": "Four decades ago, electron microscopy (EM) was the only ancillary technique available to the pathologists when routine H&E and special stains failed to reveal diagnostic features in histopathology [18] . EM examination provides a direct visualization of microbial organisms at a high magnification. Ultrastructural finding is the most direct evidence to show the presence of an infectious agent in clinical specimens. Thin section and negative stain are two common EM methods used to study pathogen morphology and morphogenesis of the microorganisms with recognition of their cytoplasmic organelles and matrix constituents. Therefore, correlation of light and electron microscopic findings not only improves pathologist's diagnostic acumen but also allows for a more coherent explanation of the pathogenesis. Since the advent of immunohistochemical and molecular techniques, EM has been less often used for identifying infectious agents. However, EM still played an essential role in determining the specific family of the pathogen involved in several outbreaks caused by novel viruses, such as Sin Nombre virus [19, 20] , Nipah virus [21, 22] , SARS-CoV [12, 23] , and monkeypox virus [24] . In these outbreak investigations, negative stain of virus isolated from tissue culture and thin-section preparation of tissue specimen facilitated the ultrastructural examination. The determination of etiologic agents guided subsequent laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic investigations. Advanced EM methods, such as immuno-EM or EM in situ hybridization using colloidal gold labels, have been developed for a more specific ultrastructural diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 201, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1116, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1120, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1139, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1143, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1159, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1163, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1190, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Electron Microscopy"}, {"text": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been widely used in all aspects of pathology diagnosis in the past three decades [25] [26] [27] . A large number of IHC are available that can be helpful in the identification of microorganisms. By using a variety of antibodies, IHC can detect the presence of microbial antigens in tissue specimens, whether they represent the intact or degraded pathogens and whether they are intracellular or extracellular (Fig. 2c) . Therefore, IHC has become a powerful technique used by pathologists for tissue diagnosis of infectious diseases. There are many ways to visualize an antibody-antigen interaction. The most common method is to apply an antibody conjugated to an enzyme, such as peroxidase [28] [29] [30] or alkaline phosphatase [31, 32] , which can further catalyze a reaction for colorimetric detection. The antibodies used for specific detection can be polyclonal or monoclonal. Polyclonal antibodies are a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies that recognize several epitopes of a specific organism or more commonly, a group of related organisms. Monoclonal antibodies are generated against a single epitope and hence more specific to the target antigen than polyclonal antibodies. Many of these antibodies are commercially available and are widely used in diagnostic pathology laboratories. Others, especially those antibodies for detecting novel emerging pathogens, are available only at highly specialized centers such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Development of new IHC is a worthwhile but usually labor-intensive task. Similar to all other laboratory assays, the sensitivity and specificity of any IHC always need a careful evaluation before establishing its status as a diagnostic assay. Detection of two or more target antigens on one slide can be achieved with multiple staining IHC assays [33] [34] [35] . These assays can expand the information obtained from each slide and reduce turnaround time compared to single staining or sequential staining methods. It is possible to assess the topographic relationship of the targets by using multiple staining IHC assays for determining the cellular tropism of viral infection with antibodies raised against virus and specific cellular markers, respectively (Fig. 1c) . These multiple staining methods not only help confirm the immunolocalization of pathogens but also enhance further understanding of pathogenesis in many emerging infections [7, 16, 19, 36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 112, "end": 116, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 117, "end": 121, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 122, "end": 126, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 726, "end": 730, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 731, "end": 735, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 760, "end": 764, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 765, "end": 768, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1857, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1862, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1863, "end": 1867, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2451, "end": 2454, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2455, "end": 2458, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2459, "end": 2462, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2466, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 439, "end": 448, "text": "(Fig. 2c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2275, "text": "(Fig. 1c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"text": "There are many advantages of using formalin-fixed tissues and IHC to detect etiologic pathogens.

It is also valuable for characterizing emerging infections, whose causes are initially unknown, such as those caused by Nipah virus [21] , SARS-CoV [12] , or Zika virus [40] . Immunolocalization of antigens by IHC provides histomorphologic correlation between the infectious pathogen and host tissue responses, which is not only crucial for diagnosis but also important to study the pathogenesis of those emerging infections [19, 21, 41, 42] . Additionally, IHC performed on fixed tissues can minimize laboratory worker's potential risk of exposure to infectious agents because of the deactivation of pathogens by formalin fixation.

It has been applied in many medical diagnostics, such as gene expression profiling, chromosomal integrity, and karyotyping, etc. There are also many ways to perform ISH in diagnosis of infectious pathogens with a variety of probes [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] , including double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probes, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes, RNA probes (riboprobes), and synthetic oligonucleotides (oligoprobes). ISH can localize nucleic acids of microorganisms in tissues and provides histomorphologic correlation between the infectious pathogen and host tissue responses (Fig. 1d) . ISH can utilize in-house probes synthesized in a well-equipped laboratory with known sequences of the target nucleic acids, minimizing the need to depend on commercial resources. The advantages of using formalin-fixed tissues and ISH to detect etiologic pathogens are similar to IHC, except it is usually less sensitive than IHC because of the potential fragmentation of target nucleic acids by formalin fixation [53, 54] . Therefore, clinical utility of ISH for infectious disease diagnosis is much more limited than IHC, especially for in situ RNA analysis. This disparity is particularly notable when considering the abundance of RNA biomarkers discovered through whole-genome expression profiling. The reasons are mainly due to the high degree of technical complexity and insufficient sensitivity and specificity of conventional RNA ISH techniques. A novel RNA ISH technology, RNAscope, has been developed and utilized in the past few years. The technology applies a unique probe design strategy that allows simultaneous signal amplification and background suppression to achieve single-molecule visualization while preserving tissue morphology. RNAscope can be applied on routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and can use either conventional chromogenic dyes for bright-field microscopy or fluorescent dyes for multiplex analysis.

Additionally, both microbial and host gene targets can be incorporated in these high-density arrays, thus allowing an opportunity to detect microbes and assess related host responses simultaneously for pathogenic features consistent with various classes of infectious agents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 131, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 132, "end": 136, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 137, "end": 141, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 825, "end": 829, "text": "[73,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 835, "end": 839, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 840, "end": 844, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Microarrays"}, {"text": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technique that can be applied on the FFPE tissue samples and has been rapidly spreading in the clinical and research arena [79, 80] .

Currently, there are still multiple factors that limit the diagnostic use of NGS in clinical laboratories, such as nonstandardized platforms, long turnaround time, large amount of data, and the need of powerful bioinformatics for data analysis. Targeted NGS investigates specific areas of interest rather than an entire gene or exon and thus produces smaller, more manageable datasets, reduces turnaround time, and decreases sequencing costs.

Similarly, adequate tissue sampling is the first and the most important step to obtain an organismspecific diagnosis of infectious diseases by using pathology techniques. The pathology laboratory must have practical guidelines for optimal specimen collection and handling and should communicate this information to the clinical staff and patient care sites. It is prudent to obtain biopsy or surgical samples from the precise site of infection and preferably before initiation of therapy to minimize the impact of treatment on subsequent diagnostic tests. This is particularly true for bacterial or fungal infections. Tissue specimens obtained surgically are acquired at great expense and pose considerable risk to the patient; therefore, they should be procured with an amount of material adequate for both histopathologic and microbiological examination. Swabs are rarely adequate for this purpose. Representative samples from all major organs should be collected in autopsy cases, especially those unexplained fatal cases due to infectious causes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General Guidelines of Using Pathology Techniques"}, {"text": "Etiologic pathogens may be focally or sparsely present in involved organs, and only a complete postmortem examination can attentively localize the causative organisms, as well as the full spectrum of their pathologic effects. In addition, the predilection site for infection may vary among different organisms. For example, herpes simplex virus tends to involve the temporal lobe in the brain more frequently, while West Nile virus usually causes more severe infection in the brain stem and spinal cord. Moreover, since multiple organs can be involved in the context of systemic diseases, collecting multiple representative portions of target organs with syndrome-based approach (Table 3) and tissue samples from any other organ system with findings suggestive of infection ensures the best chance of detecting the causative agent. Influenza-associated myocarditis is a good example to show the difficulty of identifying influenza virus in the heart tissue even with prominent histopathologic changes of myocarditis, while the evidence of infection is usually present in the respiratory tissues [92] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1095, "end": 1099, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 679, "end": 688, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "General Guidelines of Using Pathology Techniques"}, {"text": "FFPE tissue samples are usually adequate for routine H&E stain, special stains, IHC, and ISH assays.

In general, antigens and nucleic acids in tissue samples can be well preserved in paraffin-embedded blocks if formalin fixation does not exceed 2 weeks. It is highly recommended to embed tissue samples in paraffin no longer than 72 h after adequate formalin fixation. Although FFPE blocks can also be used for ultrastructural examination, it is preferably to dissect tissue samples into small thin pieces (1 mm 3 ), placed in glutaraldehyde fixative, and stored in a refrigerator for optimal EM studies. Sterile techniques are mandatory to obtain target tissue samples for microbiologic culture and PCR assays. While biopsy procedure is usually performed under a stringent sterile condition, autopsy is not. In addition, delay of postmortem examination will facilitate colonization by normal flora or contamination by environmental organisms and interfere subsequent diagnostic assays. Therefore, autopsy should be performed as soon as possible (preferably within 12 h after death) to minimize these postmortem confounding factors. Representative tissue samples for potential PCR assay should be obtained with sterile technique and frozen at -20\u00b0 C.

If the tissue specimens are not obtained from relevant lesions or areas with histopathologic changes, the subsequent tests performed on such specimens can all result in falsenegative outcomes. Timing of tissue sampling, as mentioned earlier, is another crucial element that can affect test results. Delayed autopsy procedure increases the chance of tissue autolysis and postmortem contamination, which can significantly interfere with histopathologic evaluation and all related pathologic tests. Technical issues, such as sensitivity and specificity, are universally present for each IHC, ISH, or PCR testing. A negative result cannot exclude the possibility of an infection caused by certain organisms because duration of illness, modalities of treatment, tissue sampling, and fixation may affect the outcome of these assays.
