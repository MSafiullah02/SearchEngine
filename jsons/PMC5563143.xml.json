Coronavirus infections have a range of severity and include upper and lower respiratory symptoms, with a low frequency of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.1 Acute gastrointestinal, hepatic, and neurological symptoms have also been observed.2 Since 2002, the human coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as significant public health threats. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus is the etiological agent of the 2003\u20132005 pandemic that affected more than 30 countries.3 In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus emerged in the Middle East, followed by the spread of the virus to other countries (e.g., the UK, South Korea). As of 2016, there had been 1728 confirmed cases of MERS affecting persons in 27 countries.4 Prior to these outbreaks, CoVs were known to be responsible for mild upper and lower respiratory infections. For example, human CoV 229E and OC43 cause a minority of respiratory tract infections.2 Based on phylogenetic and serological analyses, the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses has placed the CoVs in four genera, namely the Alphacoronaviruses, Betacoronaviruses, Gammacoronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses.5 Under this classification, the betacoronavirus genus has been divided into groups a to d, whereby the SARS\u2010like CoVs are found in group B and MERS\u2010like CoVs in group C. The group D so far has been detected only in bats.6\n",

This demonstrates the same mode of cell entry as the human SARS\u2010CoV.8 The bat SL\u2010CoV\u2010WIV1 could grow on human epithelial cells and Vero E6 cells, and was neutralized by human SARS convalescent sera.

At present, only one high\u2010resolution structure of a BatCoV HKU9 protein domain is known, the spike protein external receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD).17 This structure revealed critical new information such as the external subdomain adopting a helical fold versus the beta\u2010sheet topology observed in other betaCoV receptor domains. As a result, the HKU9 RBD does not bind to the other betaCoV receptors, ACE2 and CD26, underlining the importance of carrying out structural studies on bat proteins.

Nsp3 is one of the most divergent regions of the CoV genome.33 The domain structure of nsp3 is variable among CoVs,32 with one or two papain\u2010like cysteine proteases, transmembrane regions, RNA\u2010binding proteins, and one or more macrodomains.27, 34, 35 Key functions of the nsp3 include protein/protein interactions involved in replicase assembly and function;36 polyprotein processing by the papain\u2010like cysteine protease domain;37 and deubiquitinase activity involved in innate immune system interference.38 There are one or more macrodomains in the protein, for which roles in countering the host cell innate immunity have been demonstrated21, 39 and roles in viral RNA synthesis have been proposed.40 A \u201cSARS\u2010unique region\u201d with a three\u2010domain structure was identified in the nsp3 of SARS.35 The macrodomains in the SARS\u2010unique region were shown to be G\u2010quadruplex binding proteins, and to interact with the RCHY ubiquitin ligase to target p53 for degradation.35, 41, 42 The smaller C\u2010terminal domain in this region adopts a frataxin\u2010like fold and has been shown to bind purine\u2010rich RNA sequences.35 In the human SARS\u2010CoV, the functions of this region were essential for viral replication.43 However, based on discoveries since 2002 and the emergence of other viruses, it has been hypothesized that the \u201cSARS\u2010unique region\u201d is in fact conserved in other viruses, in particular in the group B, C, and D betacoronaviruses.",

The overall structural similarity between the HKU9 C domain and the SARS C domain, from betacoronavirus lineage B, was assessed by the program DALI.51 The resulting RMSD value was 1.66 \u00c5 with a DALI score of 8.2, indicating a strong match. The RMSD value for the MHV C domain from the betacoronavirus lineage A was 2.16 \u00c5, with a DALI score of 8.7. Since the \u03b2\u2010CoV HKU9 belongs to lineage D, this analysis reinforces the hypothesis advanced by us and others that the unique region of SARS nsp3 is actually conserved across multiple \u03b2\u2010CoVs.30, 32, 43, 60, 61 A structure\u2010based sequence alignment of the C domains and related proteins is shown in Figure 3(C). Residues such as Phe 578, Val 581, and Trp 590 are conserved when compared to the sequence and structure of the SARS and MHV orthologues. In contrast, Trp 590 is replaced by other aromatic or hydrophobic residues in the frataxins. Based on their low solvent accessibility, we conclude that these residues are likely to be important in stabilizing the fold, rather than for intermolecular interactions. However, other conserved residues that contribute to the surface potential such as the side chains of Arg 588, Asp 589, Lys 609, Arg 610, and Gly 611, described above, that are oriented to the same face of the protein, are likely to be responsible for a shared function between the CoV groups 2b and 2d (Fig. 3). Correspondingly, these residues are not conserved throughout the protein family.",

Left to right: HKU9 C, SARS SUD\u2010C (PDB ID: 2KAF),35 MHV C domain (PDB ID: 4YPT),30 human frataxin (PDB ID: 3T3X).52 (B) C domain electrostatic potential surfaces. Red areas represent positively charged regions, blue areas represent negatively charged areas, and white areas represent neutral areas. (C) Structure\u2010based sequence alignment of the C domain in the Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9, related viral proteins, and with other proteins in the frataxin fold family: phage T4 MotA (PDB ID: 1KAF),53 hypothetical protein (PDB ID: 1YB3), Psychromonas ingrahamii FTXN (PDB ID: 4HS5),52 Ataxia FTXN (PDB ID: 3T3X),54 AcsD (PDB ID: 2W04).55 The alignment is based on structural alignments obtained with TM\u2010Align.50 PDB codes are included after each protein name. The residue numbers for HKU9\u2010C are indicated. Alpha helix regions are displayed in red (cylinders) and beta strands are shown in blue (arrows). Gaps are shown as dashes (\u2010) and insertions where additional secondary structures are present are indicated by forward slash marks (//). Residues indicated by stars (*) discussed in the text are involved in potential functional sites. The corresponding Dali scores for the pairwise alignment of each protein with HKU9 C and the percent amino acid identity between each protein and HKU9 C domain are listed. Dali scores of 2.0 and higher indicate significant sequence identity51\n",
