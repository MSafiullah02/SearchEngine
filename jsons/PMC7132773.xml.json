A phylogenetic study of 21 MERS-CoV genomes from Saudi Arabia suggested that both human-to-human transmission and sporadic zoonotic events occur.13 The stability of the virus for prolonged periods in camel milk suggests the potential of excretion of the virus into camel milk and spread through consuming raw milk.14\n",

Family clusters of MERS-CoV have been recorded.15 The secondary attack rate in families was 1.35% in Saudi Arabia in 2014.8 Among imported travel-associated cases, very few instances of person-to-person transmission have been verified.16, 17, 18 Recent phylogenetic analysis using human sequences from Jeddah suggests that the virus has not changed from previous strains.8 Overall, it seems unlikely that the virus has increased its transmissibility or patterns of transmission. The basic reproductive number has been estimated to be <1 using real-time data until June and August 2013, respectively,19, 20 even though the upper range of estimates exceeded 1 in a scenario where infection control was not implemented.20 These findings indicate no pandemic potential for MERS-CoV so far. Recently, a committee appointed by the WHO concluded that the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern have not yet been met. Moreover, increased testing rates of less ill or asymptomatic cases may have contributed to the upsurge of detected cases.",

In an analysis of 144 confirmed and 17 possible cases, symptomatic patients typically had fever and cough, chills, sore throat, myalgia, and arthralgia, whereas vomiting and diarrhea were present in at least one third of patients.21 In the same study, 63.4% of patients developed severe respiratory disease.

Most cases were confined in the hemodialysis unit with rapid transmission and high attack rates.3 This outbreak gave the opportunity to elucidate several epidemiologic parameters of secondary MERS-CoV infection, such as the incubation period (5.2 days; 95% confidence interval, 1.92-14.7 days), serial interval (7.6 days; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-23.1 days), and heterogeneity in transmission, with many infected patients not transmitting the infection at all and 1 infected patient transmitting the infection to 7 others.3 Moreover, this outbreak raised the possibility of transmission through direct or indirect contact and between rooms in the same ward.3 A recent study showed that MERS-CoV remained viable for up to 48 hours under specific environmental conditions, which mimic the hospital environment (20\u00b0C with 40% relative humidity), whereas its stability was not reduced during aerosolization.28 These data show that MERS-CoV has the potential to spread through contact or fomites caused by prolonged survival. A model-based study found that the virus structural characteristics render it very likely to remain viable in the environment for a long period and support fecal-oral transmission.29\n",

Of 1,695 HCW contacts of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases, 19 (1.12%) tested positive, less than the 3.4% (17 of 462) rate of infection among family contacts.

However, N95 respirators are less tolerated by HCWs and are more expensive.39 The United States CDC also recommends that patients with confirmed or suspected MERS-CoV infection are placed in an airborne infection isolation room.38 HCWs with MERS-CoV infection should be strictly excluded from patient care, even with mild symptoms. The role of asymptomatic HCWs is under question. Overall, there is a need to increase infection control capacity in affected areas and areas at increased risk of being affected to prevent transmission in health care settings.",

A significant cost has been encountered in terms of personnel and time required for contact tracing and means of implementing infection control and prevention measures in health care settings. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. However, significant concerns exist in terms of the increased number of health care\u2013associated cases, gaps in knowledge regarding transmission routes, and limited infection control capacity in affected countries.
