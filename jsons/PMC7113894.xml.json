Recently, the bat origins of MERS-CoV were further supported by evidence that bat coronavirus HKU4 also uses the human MERS-CoV receptor CD26 for virus entry (Wang et al., 2014). Additionally, MERS-CoV-like viruses are also widespread in dromedary camels, with sero-epidemiological studies indicating 90% seroprevalence in adult animals (Reusken et al., 2014).",

Indeed, the crucial protective role of T-cell immune responses in coronavirus infections has been clearly documented in several animal models, e.g., feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Li et al., 2016, Takano et al., 2014, Trujillo et al., 2014). These animal models provide useful references for the study of human infection by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Infection of mice with MHV, a member of the same betacoronavirus group as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was used as an early experimental model to elucidate the role of T-cells in viral clearance and cytotoxicity (Le Prevost et al., 1975) and in T-cell oriented vaccine development (MacNamara et al., 2008, Zust et al., 2007). A primary role for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) has been demonstrated in protection from MHV and virus clearance (Stohlman et al., 1995).",

The spike (S) protein is responsible for both receptor binding and membrane fusion of the virus (Lu et al., 2015), but also acts as a major antigen for both humoral and cellular immunity (Du et al., 2009a). Xu and colleagues detected SARS-CoV-specific T-cell responses from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of convalescent SARS patients using overlapping peptides covering the whole SARS-CoV proteome (Li et al., 2008). They found that most of the antigenic peptides are located in the structural proteins (especially S protein) rather than non-structural proteins. The biased distribution of T-cell epitopes in the viral proteins may correlate with the different protein synthesis phases during the infection and the diverse abundance of the viral proteins in infected cells or antigen-presenting cells.",

We reviewed the reports concerning T-cell specific immunology of SARS-CoV and collected the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes defined since the initial SARS outbreak (Fig. 1\n). Among the CD8+ T-cell epitopes (Table 1), most peptides identified thus far are derived from the S protein with HLA-A2 restriction, which is the consequence of the immunodominance of the SARS-CoV S protein and the high coverage of HLA-A2+ populations in different ethnic groups all over the world. HLA-A*1101-, HLA-A*2402-, HLA-B*15-, and HLA-B*4001-restricted T-cell epitopes have also been defined, which can be used to detect T-cell immune responses among populations other than HLA-A2 (Liu et al., 2010b, Oh et al., 2011). Also, several H-2d-, H-2k-, and H-2b-restricted CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell epitopes have been identified using different mouse strains, which are helpful for SARS-CoV-specific T-cell studies among these animal models and the development of vaccines (Zhao et al., 2007, Zhao et al., 2010a, Zhi et al., 2005). Given that all the CD4+ T cell epitopes identified thus far are derived from the SARS-CoV S protein, further epitope discovery is still needed, especially in other structural proteins.",

Interestingly, we also defined a clustering region of CTL epitopes within the transmembrane region of the M protein (Fig. 1) (Liu et al., 2011a), which may correlate with the sequence preference by the peptide-processing related proteins, such as transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), immunoproteasome and TAP binding protein (tapasin) (Huang et al., 2016). The protein transmembrane regions are usually rich in aliphatic amino acids (e.g. Leu, Ile and Val), which are preferred for the primary anchor residues of HLA-A2 peptides (Sharpe et al., 2010). Further work is needed to elucidate whether the M protein is a good candidate antigen for a prophylactic vaccine inducing both cellular and humoral immunogenicity. We also identified the first HLA-A24-restricted immunodominant T-cell epitope from the SARS-CoV N protein (Liu et al., 2010b). Recently, several MERS-CoV-derived H-2Kd-restricted T-cell epitopes have been identified (Liu et al., 2016). T-cell responses to one of these newly defined peptides (peptide 37-1) have a protective effect against MERS-CoV challenge. The protective efficiency of the peptide is depended on an uncommon interaction of Ile5 in peptide 37-1 with Trp73 of the host MHC I H-2Kd. These T-cell epitopes with different HLA-I-restrictions and also the T-cell epitope screening platform may help to understand the T-cell immunogenicity of different proteins from coronaviruses and provide potential candidates for vaccine development.",

            "text": "Due to the low immunogenicity of single peptide vaccinations, many different strategies have been developed to elicit effective T-cell responses and efficient protection by T-cell-based vaccines. DNA vaccines encoding N or S gene segments that cover the immunodominant T-cell epitopes have been developed in mouse models. Cheung et al. produced a potential DNA vaccine candidate expressing an antigenic peptide from the SARS-CoV N protein with a single-chain-trimer (peptide-\u03b22m-MHC I) approach that induces SARS-CoV-specific T-cells with cytotoxicity to N protein-expressing cells (Cheung et al., 2007). Recombinant adeno-associated virus is also an ideal carrier for T-cell immunogens of SARS-CoV, inducing strong mucosal immune responses and protective CTL responses (Du et al., 2008). Mammalian CHO cells-expressing segments of the SARS-CoV S protein also induce potent T-cell immune responses and protection against the virus (Du et al., 2009b, Du et al., 2010). Zhao and colleagues observed that enhanced virus-specific CD8+ T-cells in mice by immunization with SARS-CoV peptide-pulsed dendritic cells also result in earlier virus clearance and increased survival (Zhao et al., 2010a). In a Phase I clinical trial, a single-plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the S protein was well tolerated and induced SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses in all vaccinees, as well as CD8+ T-cell responses in \u223c20% of individuals (Martin et al., 2008). MHC II-related antigen presentation in professional antigen-presenting cells may be involved in the dominant CD4+ T-cell response of DNA vaccines, which is required for neutralizing antibodies, though cross-priming to stimulate CD8+ T-cells also occurs (Akbari et al., 1999).",

IgG and neutralizing antibodies peak at 4 months and then progressively decrease over time (Liu et al., 2006). Eighty-nine percent of the recovered patients have detectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV at 24 months post-infection as shown by ELISA, while neutralizing antibodies are detectable in an even higher percentage of donors (Liu et al., 2006). Nevertheless, disease severity may also impact the appearance time and magnitude of the antibody responses. Cameron and colleagues reported that SARS-CoV-infected patients with fatal outcomes display deficient antibody production against the S protein compared to non-severe patients (Cameron et al., 2007). During the long term follow-up of SARS survivors, IgG is only detectable in 2 of 23 recovered donors at 6 years after illness onset (Tang et al., 2011), suggesting diminishing levels of memory B-cells against SARS-CoV.",

Although whether the memory T-cell response is sufficient to protect from reinfection requires further investigation, it has been suggested that a more robust CTL response contributes to protection against SARS-CoV in mice (Channappanavar et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2010a, Zhao et al., 2010a). Based on a series of T-cell epitopes identified thus far, as well as the overlapping peptide pools covering full-length antigens of SARS-CoV, durable memory T-cell responses against SARS-CoV have been evaluated in recovered patients (Chen et al., 2005, Fan et al., 2009, Peng et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2007). Unlike waning serum antibody levels in patients, CTL responses against the S and N proteins can still be detected from the PBMCs of recovered SARS patients 1, 2, 4, 6, and even >10 years post-infection (Da Guan et al., 2015, Ng et al., 2016, Oh et al., 2011, Tang et al., 2011).

Seroconversion for most patients occurs during the second and third week after symptom onset (Corman et al., 2016, Park et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2016b). Similar to SARS patients, weak and delayed antibody responses are associated with more severe disease or fatal outcome in patients infected by MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2016, Min et al., 2016, Park et al., 2015). However, Corman and colleagues (Corman et al., 2016) discovered that the levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies are weakly and inversely correlated with viral loads in the lower respiratory tract, suggesting that the presence of antibodies does not lead to the elimination of the virus. For MERS-CoV-specific T-cell responses, PBMCs obtained on day 24 after illness onset show a strong specific T-cell response against the MERS-CoV S protein (Da Guan et al., 2015). Interestingly, persistent and gradual increases of lymphocyte responses after symptom onset in MERS patients with or without mild pneumonia may be required for effective immune responses against MERS-CoV, whereas all of the deceased patients displayed rapid drops in their lymphocyte counts (Min et al., 2016). T-cell immunity-associated cytokines IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 levels were lower in a fatal case than in a patient who survived the infection (Faure et al., 2014).",

However, in a longitudinal study of MERS survivors in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, only two out of nine survivors remained positive for MERS-specific antibodies when tested 18 months after illness onset (Alshukairi et al., 2016). Furthermore, Arabi and colleagues (Arabi et al., 2016) reported that only 4 (36.7%) of 11 healthcare workers who had a history of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection had detectable MERS-CoV-antibody levels by ELISA a median of 381 days after infection. These data indicate that MERS-CoV-antibody levels decline more rapidly, compared to SARS-CoV survivors. Thus, it is valuable to investigate the features of T-cell immunity against MERS-CoV in survivors, which may shed light on MERS-CoV vaccine development with long-term protection in the future.",

Anti-SARS-CoV IF and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV were found in the majority (96.4%) of the SARS patients, as expected. Seventeen (60.7%) SARS patients tested positive for MERS-CoV-specific IgG detected by indirect IF, with titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:320, while seven (25%) had low titers (1:20 or less) of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody (Chan et al., 2013).

Furthermore, three peptides from the S2 region of the S protein, two from the N protein, and one from the M protein of MERS-CoV only have two or three variable residues when aligned to the corresponding sequence of SARS-CoV. Among these six peptides, Mn2 (GLMWLSYFV) in the M protein (amino acids 88\u201396) of SARS-CoV was previously identified as an immunodominant T-cell epitope based on a combination of functional and structural strategies (Liu et al., 2010a). The corresponding peptide (AMMWISYFV) in the M protein of MERS-CoV has three different residues: Gly88Ala, Leu89Met, and Leu92Ile. The structure of peptide Mn2 presented by HLA-A*0201 (Fig. 3A) shows that the P1 and P2 residues, Gly88 and Leu89, are located in the A and B pockets of HLA-A*0201, respectively, as the anchor residues. The corresponding residues Ala88 and Met89 in the MERS-CoV-derived peptide can also act as the anchor residues, which may not influence the conformation of the peptide when binding to HLA-A*0201. The solvent-exposed residue Leu92 in peptide Mn2 of SARS-CoV corresponds to an Ile in MERS-CoV. Considering the similar characteristics of Leu and Ile, this change may only have a limited influence on the TCR binding of the peptide. Thus, the peptides such as Mn2 in SARS-CoV and its parallel peptide in MERS-CoV may have a cross-TCR repertoire, which should be experimentally validated. In a recent study, a relatively conserved CD4+ T cell epitope (Fig. 1) was also recognized in SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-infected HLA-DR2 and -DR3 transgenic mice, indicating vaccine strategies targeting conserved epitopes may be broadly applicable with different coronaviruses (Zhao et al., 2016).",

Interestingly, based on PBMCs obtained from a traveler to Guangdong, China, who acquired this disease during the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, a strong T-cell-specific response against full-length MERS-CoV S protein was detected, but not cross-reactivity against the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV S protein. This may be due to the low levels of conservation in the S1 subunit, as discussed above, and may also correlate with the low efficacy of stimulating T-cell responses by recombinant proteins.",

Further, significant pathological features appear in the mice, such as changes in the lung parenchyma and increased lung edema. In contrast, treatment with S protein did not affect the severity of lung failure in Ace2 knockout mice, which indicates that the effect of S protein on acute lung injury is ACE2-specific.",

Further, passive immunotherapy using convalescent phase human plasma is being considered in MERS patients after its success in animal models (Zhao et al., 2015). However, studies also demonstrate that MERS-CoV S protein-derived vaccines induce specific CD8+ T-cell and virus-neutralizing antibodies, which could contribute to complete protection against MERS-CoV in animal models (Lan et al., 2014, Volz et al., 2015). Based on the investigations of immune memory against SARS-CoV in follow-up studies of recovered patients (discussed above), T-cell responses can provide robust long-term memory and possess a considerable potential for cross-reactivity with heterotypic coronaviruses. Thus, vaccines combining both cellular and humoral responses should be considered for coronavirus prevention. The similarities between the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV through interaction with cell receptors and blockage of host innate immune responses also point to potential therapeutic targets in patients infected with other pathogenic coronaviruses.",
