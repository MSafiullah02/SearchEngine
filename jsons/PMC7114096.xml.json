Nonstructural accessory protein genes are species-specific and are interspaced between the structural genes. The virus particle itself is enveloped and carries extruding S proteins on the membrane surface, providing the virion with the typical crown-like structure (Fields et al., 2007).",

The change took place in 2003, when the SARS-CoV emerged in the Guandong province in China (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). The epidemic spread was contained in early July of 2003, mostly by quarantine measures; however, there were also some sporadic cases in 2003\u20132004 season (Peiris et al., 2004). This sudden outbreak of a previously undescribed coronavirus brought the whole family of viruses back to the limelight, so in the consecutive two years two new human coronaviruses \u2013 HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 \u2013 were identified. Both viruses have spread worldwide and are linked with the respiratory tract disease (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005).",

The studies described in this paper indicate that such a treatment may be provided by polymeric substances. Polymers are intensively studied as potent antimicrobial systems both due to their intrinsic antimicrobial properties and as matrices for antimicrobial compounds (both organic and inorganic). The latter systems, however, require the diffusion of low-molecular-weight antimicrobials through a polymeric matrix, which may be toxic to the human body (Munoz-Bonilla and Fernandez-Garcia, 2012). Therefore, polymers which possess antimicrobial activity are the preferred solution. Moreover, polymers usually show a long-term activity. Of particular interest among antimicrobial polymers are polycations containing phosphonium groups (Kenawy and Mahmoud, 2003) or those with quaternary nitrogen atoms such as pyridinium (Tiller et al., 2002), imidazolium (Anderson and Long, 2010), or ammonium groups (Huang et al., 2008, Timofeeva et al., 2009). Other antimicrobial polymers are those containing halogens, both fluorine (Caillier et al., 2009) and chlorine (Patel et al., 2004), polymers containing sulfo groups (Zaneveld et al., 2002), or those substituted with low-molecular-weight compounds such as antibiotics ciprofloxacin (Woo et al., 2000) or norfloxacin (Yang and Santerre, 2001). Most of the antimicrobial polymers show antibacterial properties, while those with antiviral activity are much less frequent. It is still difficult to predict if a polymer shows antimicrobial properties just based on its structure, therefore its potential antimicrobial activity has to be verified experimentally.",

Analysis revealed that HTCC and HM-HTCC hamper the appearance of morphological changes and cell death following the HCoV-NL63 infection (Fig. 2\n).

To test whether the observed effect is not cell-specific, the inhibitory activity of the polymers in a more natural environment was also assessed; HAE cultures, mimicking natural conductive airway epithelium, were used for this purpose. HAE cultures are formed by the multi-layered, fully differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells growing on collagen-coated plastic supports on air/liquid interphase (Banach et al., 2009, Pyrc et al., 2010). Due to technical restrictions, it was not possible to use a standard assay with inhibitors present in the apical medium. HAE cultures were infected in the presence of tested inhibitors during 2 h incubation and subsequently the apical medium was removed. Further, the apical surfaces of HCoV-NL63-infected and mock-infected HAE cultures were rinsed every 24 h with 100 \u03bcl of the medium containing a given inhibitor. Samples of the apical fluid were concurrently collected. Real-time RT-PCR analysis shows the drastic decrease in the number of viral copies in the presence of the tested polymers, proving their effectiveness also in this semi-natural setting (Fig. 4\nA). It is also of note that incubation of HAE cultures with respective polymers did not result in a marked decrease in cell viability (Fig. 4B), which suggests these polymers may be potentially used in the treatment of coronaviral illnesses.",

Two different assays were used to appropriately evaluate the cytotoxic potential of the tested polymers. First, an XTT test was performed, based on the ability of eukaryotic mitochondrial enzymes to transform the substrate (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) to colored formazan salts. As there is a direct relationship between cell viability and the amount of the dye produced, it was possible to determine the relative viability of cells. The neutral red (NR) assay was used as the second method. The neutral red dye is able to penetrate living cells and it accumulates in endosomes, therefore it was possible to analyze and quantify the rate of this process, as described in Section 2. Following the 6-day incubation of LLC-MK2 or A549 cells in the presence of the tested polymers, the media were removed and the cell viability was evaluated. Both methods produced consistent estimation of the polymer toxicity and the results are presented in Table 3\nand Fig. 3. The HTCC polymer is not toxic at effective concentrations (up to 100 \u03bcg/ml), showing highly specific inhibition of viral infection. At higher concentrations the cytotoxic effect becomes visible (IC50\n > 150 \u03bcg/ml), but one should remember that LLC-MK2 cells are incubated with polymer for six consecutive days due to low replication rate of the HCoV-NL63 in this model system. The second tested polymer \u2013 HM-HTCC \u2013 shows similar toxicity, though its inhibitory properties are inferior compared to HTCC. For LR7 cells, following the 2-day incubation in the presence of the tested polymers, the media were removed and the cell viability was evaluated with the XTT assay (Fig. 5B). Obtained results were consistent with those presented in Fig. 2. Also in this case no cytotoxicity was observed in an effective range for HTCC and only minor toxicity for HM-HTCC.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses received relatively little attention as human pathogens, as for over 40 years they have been considered to be common cold viruses only. SARS-CoV epidemic and subsequent studies on this family of pathogens revealed surprising variety of species infecting animals and humans, and a potential for future coronavirus-related outbreaks (Poon et al., 2005, van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2009). This is particularly important considering recent identification of new coronavirus infecting humans (Wise, 2012). As mentioned above, a clear link between HCoV-NL63 and the respiratory diseases was established in a prospective population-based study (PRI.DE) on lower respiratory tract infections in children less than three years of age in Germany. Of the children with HCoV-NL63 infection, 45% had laryngotracheitis (croup) compared to only 6% in the control group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the chance of croup is 6.6 times higher in HCoV-NL63-positive children than in HCoV-NL63-negative children (van der Hoek et al., 2005). Considering the observed pathogenicity and worldwide distribution of the virus, in severe cases (e.g., in children, immunocompromised and elder patients) the application of a therapeutic drug may be required to hamper the disease progression. Until present, some inhibitors have been described for HCoV-NL63, interfering with different stages of HCoV-NL63 replication.",

Yang et al. designed and synthesized a set of specific Mpro inhibitors, repressing replication of multiple coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63 (Yang et al., 2005). Another interesting approach was proposed by Pyrc et al., who used synthetic peptides interfering with S protein fusogenic activity by interacting with heptad repeat regions in the S2 domain. The same group of authors suggested employment of RNAi technology and small molecule inhibitors previously shown to inhibit other viruses (Pyrc et al., 2006). An interesting and novel approach for inhibition of coronaviral infection was proposed initially by Pfefferle et al., who identified interaction between cyclophilins/immunophilins and the coronaviral non-structural protein 1. Such an interaction is maintained in all coronaviral species, though what is even more important, commercially available peptide inhibitors of cyclophilins/immunophilins are able to hamper coronaviral infection (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2012, de Wilde et al., 2011, Pfefferle et al., 2011, Tanaka et al., 2012).",

Only polymers able to impede replication of the virus in vitro, namely HTCC and its hydrophobic derivative, HM-HTCC, were selected (HTPVA and PAH showed only very low inhibitory activity). Further studies showed that both polymers were also able to inhibit replication of MHV in a cell culture. Evaluation of compounds using other human viruses (i.e., influenza A, hMPV, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and human herpes virus type 1) showed no inhibitory activity, suggesting that abolishment of coronaviral infection is a highly specific process.",

Therefore, one may assume that the observed activity relies on the direct interaction of the polymer with the virus (e.g., with the S protein, essential for virus entry). Indeed, the analysis of the interaction between HTCC polymer and the recombinant ectodomain of the S protein showed binding, resulting in the formation of protein\u2013polymer complexes. One may assume that such binding will result in the efficient inactivation of the virus. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine whether HTCC polymer hampers NL63-S/ACE2 interaction, as the affinity of NL63-S to ACE2 is very low (Lin et al., 2008, Mathewson et al., 2008) and it was not possible to visualize this process with accessible methods. Careful analysis of polymers suggests that the combination of particular polymeric chain and its proper substituent is indispensable for its activity. For example, the non-modified oligochitosan did not present any antiviral properties; furthermore, no inhibitory effect was seen for other polymeric chains substituted in a similar fashion (data not shown).",

Since the distribution of acetylated and deacetylated NH2\u2013 groups along the chitosan chain is random, this is often reflected by showing that R may be either H or \u2013COCH3 group. Consequently, since in HM-HTCC polymer some of the NH2\u2013 groups are substituted with \u2013C12H25 groups, some of R groups may be H, some \u2013COCH3 groups, and some \u2013C12H25 groups in the same chitosan chain.
