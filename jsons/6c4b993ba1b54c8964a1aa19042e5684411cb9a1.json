For example, long-range RNA-RNA interactions (LRIs) play an important role in the life cycle of RNA viruses. Many LRIs are already known to act directly as activators or inhibitors of viral replication and translation (Nicholson and White, 2014) . For example, several interactions have been recently identified as potential new LRIs in the genome of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) using LRIscan (Fricke et al., 2015) . Some of these computationally identified interactions have already been verified experimentally (Romero-L\u00f3pez and Berzal-Herranz, 2012; Tuplin et al., 2012; Friebe et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2009; Honda et al., 1999a; Wang et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2003; Beguiristain et al., 2005) .",

Technically, such interactions can be destroyed by removal or mutation of the interacting segments using in vitro experiments (Friebe et al., 2005; Romero-L\u00f3pez and Berzal-Herranz, 2009 ). Such sequence changes can result in secondary structure changes and finally manifest different viral titers. However, with the alteration of the sequence, unwanted effects can arise that not only effect the LRI. To cope with this issue, we can modify both interacting RNA segments simultaneously. Additionally, we aim for the combination of both mutated segments to result in a similar interaction strength in comparison to the interaction between the wild-type (WT) sequences. A single mutated sequence segment in combination with the respective WT sequence should destroy the interaction. Such a technique was recently used to verify a possible LRI between two IAV segments (Gavazzi et al., 2013a) .",

For two nucleotide sequences of length k and l and the number of possible synonymous codons c, the worst case runtime can be described by ). This large search space can be drastically reduced by various filter steps implemented in SIM (see below). Because the runtime depends exponentially on the length of the input sequences, we recommend to limit the interaction length to maximal 30 nt. Additionally, longer sequences are more likely to form intra-molecular secondary structures instead of forming stable structures with each other. Whereas SIM can be used to evaluate longer sequences, the tool is originally intended for two smaller sequence segments forming a stable secondary structure. For the prediction of LRIs in viral RNA genomes and longer sequences, we recommend LRIscan (Fricke et al., 2015) . The main computational steps of SIM are (1) preprocessing, (2) permutation, (3) attenuation, (4) recovery, and (5) sampling.",

Depending on the user input, SIM can automatically create the reverse-complement strand of negative single-stranded RNA viruses for folding, while maintaining codon integrity on the positive strand. This can be easily achieved with the -virusclass=ssRNA-, -reverse, and -complement options.

Thus, SIM directly accepts the whole sequence as input, together with a start and end position for the snips and the reading frame. The tool first extracts the requested interacting segments from each sequence. Each of them will be automatically increased in both directions if the provided range would otherwise split a codon, based on the predefined reading frame (Fig. 1 ). This ensures a preservation of all codons. Both sequences, pre-snip1 (ps 1 ) and pre-snip2 (ps 2 ), will then be fold together using RNAcofold to acquire only codons involved in the folding.

It is therefore vital to increase the distance between these mfe scores. Therefore, the user can directly specify the required distance with the filter percentage (-filterperc) parameter. The defined value is then multiplied with the mfe(s 1 ,s 2 ) value to obtain an upper limit (denoted l) for mfe(s 1 ,m 2 ) and mfe(m 1 ,s 2 ).

Overall workflow of SIM, exemplarily shown for two sequences from a negative single-stranded RNA virus genome (ssRNA-) (a) The first step extracts the defined range in each sequence and possibly increases the range to preserve codons based on the given reading frame. Both so-called pre-snips are folded with RNAcofold to remove unpaired codons at the endings. We refer to an extracted single-stranded RNA snippet as snip. (b) All possible codon permutations (here, reverse complements due to ssRNA-) are generated for both snips (called perms) to conserve the amino acid sequence. Permutations with too many mutations defined by the mutations (-mut) parameter are discarded. (c) To further decrease the total number of combinations, SIM will fold each snip with all permutations of the other snip and keep permutations with a mfe higher or equal to mfe(snip1, snip2) times the filter percentage (-prc) parameter, denoted as upper limit l. (d) All remaining snip1 permutations will then be folded against all snip2 permutations to find snip1 and snip2 mutations with a similar fold mfe. A double-mutant mfe(mut1, mut2) fold is considered to be similar, if its mfe is lower than the wild-type mfe(snip1, snip2) times the lower deviation (-ldv) parameter and higher than mfe(snip1, snip2) times the upper deviation (-udv) parameter. (e) The last step will minimize a combined single-mutant mfe(snip1, mut2) and mfe(mut1, snip2) by keeping both mutations in a similar range depending on the mutation range (-mrg) parameter. The range for each mutation combination is defined by (mfe(snip1, mut2) + mfe(mut1, snip2)) \u00b7 0.5 \u00b7 (1 + -mrg) for the lower threshold (l-mrg) and (mfe(snip1, mut2) + mfe(mut1, snip2)) \u00b7 0.5 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 -mrg) for the upper threshold (u-mrg). Different sets and their abbreviations are given in brackets. Details can be found in Section 2. could result in unfavorable interaction strengths between WTs and mutants. An unfavorable v and u pair would result in a significantly higher single-mutant mfe of the mutant folded with the WT sequence in comparison to the mfe of the other mutant and WT combination. Therefore, it is recommended to keep both, mfe(s 1 ,v i \u2208 M) and mfe (u i \u2208 M, s 2 ), in a similar range while minimizing the combined mfe. Accordingly, the sampling step takes the mutation range (-mrg) parameter into account and calculates the lower threshold l-mrg as (Gavazzi et al., 2013b) . With the help of SIM, experimentalists can simulate for the first time specific RNA-RNA interactions of viral codingand non-coding sequence snippets, potentially forming stable longrange interactions. Using SIM, the search space of possible doublemutant sequences, forming a stable secondary structure with a comparable mfe to the wild-type structure and simultaneously disrupting the single-mutants structure, can be drastically reduced. Therefore, SIM can be used prior time-and cost-consuming wet-lab experiments to simulate promising double-mutant sequences, that preserve the wildtype LRI but are not functional as single-mutants. In this context, the use of SIM is not limited to RNA interactions between viral sequences, as the tool can be used for calculations between any two interacting RNA sequences. To validate SIM and to show that the tool is able to predict biological relevant mutants, we used two experimentally verified interactions, one in the influenza A virus H5N2 A/finch/England/ 2051/1991 strain and another in the hepatitis C virus type 1b strain (accession: AJ238799.1).",

(2013a) computationally, we adjusted some key parameters of SIM. Importantly, we limited the number of possible mutation pairs to four and calculated the mfe between the WT and mutant (mut) combinations in mere seconds. We further increased the search space of single mutants through setting the filter percentage parameter to 0.6, derived from the difference between the lowest single-mutant and the WT mfe value (\u221224.60 kcal/mol \u00f7 \u221214.00 kcal/mol = 0.569; see Fig. 2a and c) . Because there exist multiple double mutants with reasonable mfe values, we also had to define an exact search range for the double-mutant. The lower deviation was set to 1.07 and the upper deviation to 1.08, based on the difference between the double-mutant and WT mfe values (\u221226.40 kcal/mol/\u221224.60 kcal/mol = 1.0731; see Fig. 2a and b) . The SIM results of the secondary structure predictions and mfe values for the two IAV segment combinations are shown in Fig. 2 . By only allowing a maximum of four mutation pairs, we were able to calculate the same structures and mutations as previously proposed by Gavazzi et al. (2013a) .

Again, we want to point out that for the in silico experiment it is preferable to have a similar mfe between the two wildtype IAV segments mfe(NS WT , PB1 WT ) and the double-mutant mfe(NS mut , PB1 mut ) as well as between the single mutants mfe(NS WT , PB1 mut ) and mfe(NS mut , PB1 WT ).",

We adjusted the parameters of SIM and allowed only four mutation pairs in maximum to calculate the mfe values for mutated sequence combinations of the NS and PB1 segments like previously shown by Gavazzi et al.

The mfe values and secondary structures are shown for (a) the wild-type interaction, (b) the double-mutant interaction, (c) the first single-mutant (PB1 mut ) interaction, and (d) the second single-mutant (NS mut ) interaction.",
