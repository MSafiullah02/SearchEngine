            "text": "Porous carbon monoliths (PCMs) were prepared from waste corrugated cardboard box (WCCB) via slurrying in FeCl 3 solution followed by molding and thermal treatment. The thermal process was analyzed by a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The evolution of physicochemical characteristics of PCMs was studied. The photothermal conversion and solar steam generation performances of the optimal sample (PCM Fe/600 ) were evaluated. The adsorption properties of PCM Fe/600 for methylene blue (MB) were investigated. Results showed that Fe 3+ promoted the breaking of cellulose chains in WCCB, leading to the occurrence of pyrolysis of WCCB at lower temperatures and the reduction of activation energy by 76.63 kJ mol \u22121 . Char yield raised because volatile radicals were captured by FeCl 3 -derived amorphous Fe(III) species, then involved in char formation. Amorphous Fe(III) continuously converted into Fe 3 O 4 crystallites with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 700\u00b0C, then \u03b1-Fe was formed at 800\u00b0C via the carbothermal reduction of Fe 3 O 4 . FeCl 3 was favorable to the formation of a developed microporous structure. Surface area significantly increased with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 600\u00b0C due to the removal of volatiles. The etching of carbon by Fe 3 O 4 above 700\u00b0C also led to the increase of surface area. PCM Fe/600 exhibited higher optical absorption than other samples due to its high graphite degree and porosity. It also had excellent photothermal performance; thus, solar steam yield was 1.46 times that of the pure water with the assistance of PCM Fe/600 . PCM Fe/600 in floating state was effective in adsorption of MB from water. Besides, the adsorption behavior fitted Langmuir model with a monolayer adsorption capacity reached up to 70.9 mg g \u22121 .",

            "text": "Solar steam generation (SSG) has a great application prospect in producing clean drinkable water from polluted water at zero CO 2 emission, since it uses the renewable and abundant solar energy as the only energy source [1, 2] . In typical SSG systems, solar energy is harvested and converted to thermal energy by photothermal materials and the thermal energy is used to heat up liquid water to generate steam [3] . Many efforts have been devoted to developing advanced photothermal materials, which have made the old concept of SSG become a rejuvenated green technology [4] . Carbonaceous materials are inherently suitable for broad light absorption owing to the \u03c0-band's optical transitions. Their optically excited electrons can quickly relax via thermalization due to electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering [5] . Various carbonaceous materials, such as graphene, graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotube (CNT), graphite, carbon black, etc. have been investigated as the photothermal materials [6] . Although CNT and graphene are two representative kinds of carbonaceous materials for SSG, both of them are still more expensive than gold. Moreover, the fabrication of graphene or CNT-based photothermal materials is complicated, making them unrealistic for widespread use [7, 8] . Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop inexpensive, easy-to-manufacture, mechanically robust carbonaceous materials for SSG [9] .",

Waste corrugated cardboard boxes (WCCB) have became one of the main constituents of municipal solid waste (MSW) in China, but less than 20% of them are collected and reused [21, 22] . Therefore, it is of great environmental and economic significance to develop a facile and feasible way for the recycling of WCCB.

Moreover, as a typical Lewis acidic ion, Fe 3+ possibly interacted with the glucose units during slurrying, forming relatively stable complexes and changing electronic cloud distribution; thus, the break of glycosidic bonds can be promoted [30, 31] .

Gram-Schmidt curve indicates the variation of the yields of the volatile compounds with temperature. As shown in Fig.  5c , Gram-Schmidt curves H 2 O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB had peaks at 368 and 322\u00b0C, respectively, indicating the release of large amounts of gaseous products. When the temperature is fixed, absorbance information at different wavenumbers can be obtained to study the components released at this particular moment. Figure 5 d shows the FTIR spectra at the Gram-Schmidt peak temperatures for H 2 O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB. The gaseous products composed of a variety of molecules were evolved due to the pyrolysis of cellulose. By comparing the spectra of H 2 O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB, it was found that the types of the released products were not changed due to the presence of FeCl 3 , but the relative contents of these components were changed. The peaks centered at 3575 and 1506 cm \u22121 represented -OH bond stretching vibrations in H 2 O. The peak at 2819 cm \u22121 indicated the stretching vibration of C-H in acetaldehyde. The strongest peak at 2362 cm \u22121 was caused by the release of CO 2 . The release of CO led to the presence of two subtle peaks at 2184 and 2113 cm \u22121 . The strong peak at 1748 cm \u22121 belonged to C=O stretching in furfurals. The peak at 1377 cm \u22121 can be ascribed to the bending vibration of phenolic -OH groups. The peaks at 1170 and 1106 cm \u22121 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of C-O-C in levoglucosan (LG) and -OH in hydroxyacetone (HA), respectively [32] . The subtle peak at 863 cm \u22121 suggested the presence of hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA) [33] . The evolution histories of gaseous products from H 2 O-WCCB and Fe-WCCB as a function of temperature are presented in Fig. 6 . Basically, the release of gaseous products from Fe-WCCB started at lower temperatures, which was attributed to the destruction of cellulosic fibers by Fe 3+ during slurrying, as mentioned in Sect. 3.1.2. More importantly, the yields of the volatiles significantly reduced due to the presence of Fe 3+ , resulting in a higher char yield of Fe-WCCB. It was assumed that Fe(III) species played an important role in the inhibition of the generation of the volatile organics. The organics gaseous products were mainly released from Fe-WCCB between 200 and 360\u00b0C, and FeCl 3 decomposed into amorphous Fe(III) species (e.g., FeOOH) within this temperature range [34, 35] .",

            "text": "Many researchers suggested that the thermal conversion of cellulose follows free-radical mechanism [36] [37] [38] . It proposes that heat causes the vibration and cleavage of covalent bonds in cellulose, forming free radicals and radical terminals on the surface of the solid, and the reactions are not terminated till two radicals collide with each other to form stable compound [39, 40] . The stable gaseous products are mainly generated from the reactions between the hydrogen radical and other radicals in the gas phase, while the radical reactions occurred inside and on the surface of cellulose network result in the formation of char [41, 42] . It has been extensively reported that FeOOH or Fe 2 O 3 can be used as a flame retardant and a smoke suppression agent, because Fe(III) has the ability to capture radicals generated via the thermal decomposition of polymers [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . As illustrated in Fig. 7 , instead of directly converting into stable gaseous products, the free radicals generated from the thermal cracking of WCCB were firstly trapped by the Fe(III) species deposited on the surface of the solid particles, enhancing the chances of these free radicals participating in char formation process via condensation and polymerization reactions. Thus, less gaseous products were released from Fe-WCCB and the char yield increased. In fact, the transformation of Fe species and their interaction with WCCB-derived char can also be reflected by the evolution histories of CO and CO 2 from Fe-WCCB (see Fig. 6 ). The release of CO below 500\u00b0C was caused by the thermal cracking of cellulose and the polymerization of the carbonaceous solid. The release of CO between 480 and 670\u00b0C was possibly caused by the carbothermal reduction of the amorphous FeOOH or Fe 2 O 3 by amorphous carbon [35, 48, 49] .",

            "text": "A sharp CO peak emerged at 840\u00b0C, and the yield of CO 2 also ramped up above 820\u00b0C. These phenomena can be explained by the reaction between Fe 3 O 4 and amorphous carbon [34, 50] . Figure 9 shows the N 2 -adsorption isotherm of PCM Fe/400 within the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0 to 0.3, and N 2adsorption/desorption isotherms of PCM Fe/500 , PCM Fe/600 , PCM Fe/700 , PCM Fe/800 , and PCM 800 within the P/P 0 range of 0 to 1. The adsorption isotherms of all the samples except PCM Fe/400 showed steep N 2 uptakes at P/P 0 \u2264 0.01, suggesting the initial filling of micropores (pore diameter \u2264 2 nm). The adsorbed volumes increased gradually at P/P 0 \u2265 0.01 with no plateau at high relative pressures, indicating the presence of mesopores (2 nm < pore diameter < 50 nm). Based on the N 2adsorption data, the calculated value of BET surface area (S BET ) of PCM Fe/400 was only 35 m 2 g \u22121 , suggesting the incomplete removal of volatile matters at 400\u00b0C. Pore characteristic parameters of the other samples calculated according Table 3 . S BET increased to 264 m 2 g \u22121 when the carbonization temperature reached up to 500\u00b0C, because the releasing of volatiles at high temperature greatly favored the formation of pores. With the carbonization temperature increasing to 600\u00b0C, higher micropore volume (V micro ) and S BET were achieved due to the further removal of volatiles and consumption of amorphous carbon via the reduction of Fe(III) species to Fe 3 O 4 . The mesopore volume (V meso ) decreased because the sintering effect at high temperature resulting in the narrowing of pores and the shrinkage of carbon structure. The development of pore volume was affected slightly by the increase of carbonization temperature from 600 to 700\u00b0C, because the releasing of volatiles finished within this temperature range, and only the consumption of amorphous carbon contributed to the development of porosity. S BET increased remarkably from 358 to 404 m 2 g \u22121 because a lot of Fe 3 O 4 formed below 800\u00b0C was reduced to \u03b1-Fe, leading to the etching of char and formation of micropores. Compared with PCM Fe/800 , PCM 800 had much lower S BET and V micro , but a higher V meso . These differences demonstrated that the charring process of WCCB was significantly affected by FeCl 3 , which was favorable to the formation of a more developed microporous structure. DFT pore size distribution of PCM Fe/500 , PCM Fe/600 , PCM Fe/700 , PCM Fe/800 , and PCM 800 within different pore diameter ranges is shown in Fig. 10 . PCM Fe/500 , PCM Fe/600 , PCM Fe/700 , and PCM Fe/ 800 showed sharp peaks between 0.5 and 0.6 nm, indicating the presence of large amounts of micropores. Besides, more micropores with smaller diameters were formed with the carbonization temperature increasing from 500 to 800\u00b0C. PCM Fe/500 , PCM Fe/ 600 , PCM Fe/700 , and PCM Fe/800 also had mesopores with diameters between 2.25 and 4.30 nm. The distribution became weaker when the carbonization temperature increased from 500 to 600\u00b0C due to sintering effect, while the consumption of amorphous carbon contributed to the generation of some new mesopores within the same diameter range. By comparing the DFT curves of PCM Fe/800 and PCM 800 , it was found that the introduction of FeCl 3 was obviously beneficial to the formation of micropores. However, the mesoporous structure became less developed due to the blockage of mesopores caused by the FeCl 3 -derived products. As mentioned, carbon materials can be used as solar absorbers due to optical transitions in the D band. Thus, Raman spectrometry analysis was necessary [51] . Raman spectra of PCM Fe/500 , PCM Fe/600 , PCM Fe/700 , and PCM Fe/ 800 are shown in Fig. 11a . The spectra of all the samples exhibited D band and G band centered at 1334 and 1580 cm \u22121 , respectively. D band is related to lattice defect and used to represent the disorder degree of graphite carbon, while G band is related to the vibration of sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice [52] . The ratio of the relative intensity of D band and G band (I D /I G ) is proportional to the crystalline degree of carbon materials [53] . The I D /I G values of the samples increased from 0.74 to 0.97 with the carbonization temperature increasing from 500 to 800\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of more defect sites. For a quantitative characterization of the samples, the UV-Vis-NIR spectra were measured in the broadband solar spectrum. As shown in Fig. 11b) , PCM Fe/600 exhibited high light absorption above 80% within a broadband wavelength from 256 to 2140 nm, demonstrating its highest solar light absorption ability among these samples. Although the lowest I D /I G value of PCM Fe/500 suggested that this sample contained the most sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms and \u03c0 electrons accounting for light absorption, PCM Fe/600 and PCM Fe/700 had higher light adsorption abilities than PCM Fe/500 . This was because the light adsorption ability of a porous carbon material was not only closely related with its \u03c0 electrons, but also its pores. As shown in the inset, the incident light trapped in the pores of the carbon monolith can bounce back and forth between the walls, resulting in the light propagation and multiple light matter interactions and effective light harvest [4, 8, 54] . Thus, a higher BET surface area was no doubt conducive to improving the light adsorption.",

The variation of the recorded temperature of PCM Fe/600 surface with irradiation time can be seen from Fig. 13 , and the inset shows the optical image of PCM Fe/600 being irradiated under 0.25 sun and the IR images of PCM Fe/600 surface under 0.25 sun irradiation for 1830 s in the dry state. The surface temperature of PCM Fe/600 increased rapidly from 25.2 to 51.6\u00b0C within the first 60 s. The increase of temperature became slowly after 150 s, and finally attained a high equilibrium value (61.9\u00b0C) within 1830 s. The temperature variation proved that PCM Fe/600 had a good photothermal conversion performance, implying it can be used as a promising candidate of SSG.",

            "text": "Mechanical stability is important during the use of the monolith for SSG, because the easy destruction of the samples must be avoided. As shown in Fig. 14 , PCM Fe/ 600 was pressed under a beaker filled with water weighing 1267.75 g, and the monolith character of PCM Fe/600 can be perfectly retained. This proved that PCM Fe/600 was able to withstand the pressure at least 4875 times of its own weight (2.55 N), thus we can say that PCM Fe/600 had a good mechanical rigidity. Moreover, PCM Fe/600 can float well just above the water surface with the help of EPE foam. A hot region is expected to appear on the top of PCM Fe/600 under solar irradiation via photothermal conversion. Benefitting from the porous framework providing water transport channels, water can be continuously pumped to the hot upper surface of PCM Fe/600 . In this configuration, the solar energy is localized at the water-air interface to heat thin layer where evaporation occurs, instead of wastefully heating the entire body of water, which conforms to the definition of interfacial SSG (ISSG) [3, 56] . Figure 15 a shows the photographs of the two different steam generation scenes (the temperature measuring points were marked by \"+\") and the IR images of the floating PCM Fe/600 , water surrounding PCM Fe/600 and pure water under 0.25 sun irradiation for 3600 s. Figure 16 shows that the evaporation of pure water within 3600 s was 0.37 g, while the evaporation of water in the presence of the floating PCM Fe/600 increased to 0.54 g under the same condition. The increase in water evaporation can be attributed to ISSG occurred on the hot surface of PCM Fe/ 600 . Moreover, as shown in the inset, PCM Fe/600 acted as the heat source distributing heat to the neighboring water, thus this heat island effect no doubt contributed to the improvement of steam generation.",

To determine whether PCM Fe/600 was simultaneously suitable for SSG and adsorption, the adsorption behavior of PCM Fe/ 600 for MB was studied. The adsorption isotherm of MB on PCM Fe/600 is shown in Fig. 17a , as can be seen, the increase in initial concentration of MB led to the increase of adsorption equilibrium, this was because the initial concentration provided a driving force for MB transferred from the aqueous phase to the surface of PCM Fe/600 . The inset of Fig. 17a shows the linear fitting of adsorption equilibrium data by Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models, and the best fitting model can be determined by the highest R 2 value. R 2 values and the isotherm Table 4 . Langmuir model had the best fitting, suggesting the formation of MB monolayer on the PCM Fe/600 surface and no further adsorption occurred after the formation of the monolayer, and there was no MB molecules transmigrated in the plane of the neighboring surface. Moreover, each MB molecule had similar enthalpy and activation energy. Based on the Langmuir constant, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of PCM Fe/600 for MB was calculated to be 70.9 mg g \u22121 . The comparison of MB adsorption capacities of PCM Fe/600 and some other waste-derived porous carbon materials are shown in Table 5 . As can be seen, PCM Fe/600 showed a competitive MB adsorption capacity, outperforming some other porous carbons in the literatures.",

PCM Fe/600 kept floating on water surface with the help of EPE foam, then the beaker was sealed using parafilm and left undisturbed. As shown in Fig. 17b , the removal efficiency of MB by PCM Fe/600 reached 77% within 5 days, and it continued to increase smoothly to nearly 100% on day 20. The adsorption rate was not as fast as that of a floatable carbon monoliths reported in a previous study [62, 67] , and this was possibly because of the following reasons. First, PCM Fe/600 needed more macro-and mesopores that provided channels for the fast diffusion of the MB dye to the active adsorption sites. Second, a stronger interaction between the functional groups on PCM Fe/600 surface and MB molecules was required. Third, in the present study, the low initial concentration of MB solution provided limited driving force for mass transfer between the aqueous phase and solid medium. Besides, the MB solution was left undisturbed without stirring that can increasing contact between MB and PCM Fe/600 . The deficiencies of PCM Fe/600 are pointed out, as well as the future research directions. Anyway, the floating PCM Fe/600 was proved to be useful for absorbing the dissolved pollutants from water. Moreover, As can be seen from the inset, the MB-absorbed PCM Fe/600 can be recovered from water via magnetic separation, and this phenomenon also reflected the potential of the floating PCM Fe/600 being manipulated by magnetic force during its use. Based on the adsorption ability and magnetic response exhibited by the floating PCM Fe/600 , this material may find applications in pond water purification and environmental clean-up of oil spills.",

Both the release of volatiles and etching of carbon contributed to the development of the porous structure of PCMs, and FeCl 3 was favorable to the formation of micropores. The optimal sample (PCM Fe/600 ) exhibited high optical absorption above 80% within a broadband wavelength, because it was rich in both sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms and pores. The surface temperature of PCM Fe/600 in dry state achieved 61.9\u00b0C under 0.25 sun irradiation due to its good photothermal conversion ability. PCM Fe/600assisted water evaporation was 1.46 times that of the pure water because of the occurrence of interfacial solar-derived evaporation and heat island effect.
