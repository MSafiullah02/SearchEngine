            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections continue to be a major public health problem worldwide (Barraud et al., 1999). More than 400 million people worldwide are currently infected with hepatitis B virus. Approximately 20% of HBV patients will develop chronic hepatitis, and are at significant risk of developing cirrhosis or liver hepatocarcinoma. HBV is the prototype of hepadnaviridae, a family of small enveloped hepatotropic DNA viruses that can infect the liver of human (Marion and Robinson, 1983). Chronic hepatitis B patients are commonly treated with either interferon alpha (INF-\u03b1), or the nucleoside analog lamivudine (3TC), adefovir, entecavir or telbivudine which are the synthetic reverse transcriptase inhibitors (De Clercq, 1999, Delmas et al., 2002, Buster and Janssen, 2006). However, none of these therapies are completely safe and effective. Although direct antiviral therapy with amivudine or adefovir could efficiently control chronic active hepatitis B, drug resistance or renal toxicity could develop progressively several months after the initiation of therapy. It is thus still urgently required to identify effective anti-HBV agents.",

            "text": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) are inorganic cluster-like complexes and constituted from oxide anion and transition metal cations. These complexes have shown potential applications in multitudinal fields such as catalysis, medicine and functional materials (Pope and M\u00fcller, 1991, Pope and M\u00fcller, 1994). Especially, the medicinal properties of POMs have been a subject of interest (Witvrouw et al., 2000, Judd et al., 2001, Shigeta et al., 2003, Yamase, 2005). These compounds have low toxicity for cultured cells, and relatively less expensive than the \u201cchemical\u201d antiviral drugs. Recently, POMs have been reported to inhibit the replication of RNA viruses and DNA viruses in vitro and in vivo, such as the human immunodeficiency virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, influenza virus and herpes simplex virus (Rhule et al., 1998, Dan et al., 2002). The activity of POMs against hepatitis B virus was also suggested by Zoulim (1999). The mechanism of action of POMs remains to be fully elucidated, but may occur at any of the life cycle stages, including viral adsorption, penetration, or reverse-transcription (Dan et al., 2002, Shigeta et al., 2003). Among the various POMs, keggin-type heteropolyoxotungstates [PW10Ti2O40]7\u2212 (Domaille and Knoth, 1983, Ozeki and Yamase, 1991) shows high antiviral activity. The interesting biological results of [PW10Ti2O40]7\u2212 prompted us to explore the antiviral activity of compounds containing [PW10Ti2O40]7\u2212 anions as potential anti-HBV agents.",

In compound 1, the polyoxoanion [PTi2W10O40]7\u2212 exhibits a well-known Keggin structure (Fig. 1\nA). The central P atom is surrounded by a cube of eight oxygen atoms with each oxygen site half-occupied. The P\u2013O distance is 1.51(2) \u00c5.

The K\u2013O distances range from 2.640(11) to 2.900(15) \u00c5. Thus, the K1 centers can be regarded as a joint to connect all the polyoxoanions together. The K2 center (Fig. 1C) also exhibits the eight coordination environment with two terminal O atoms (O4) of two polyoxoanions, four coordination water molecules (OW2 and OW3) and two Cl anions. The K\u2013O distances are in the range of 2.39(2)\u20132.71(3) \u00c5, while the K\u2013Cl distance is 2.80(4) \u00c5. It is interesting that all coordination atoms are shared by two K2 centers. Based on this connection mode, the K centers form a 1-D chain via these double-bridging atoms (Fig. 2\nA).

Polyoxometalates, as non-nucleoside analogs, have been proven to exhibit broad inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2), herpes simplex virus, and influenza virus. Especially, the titanium-containing polyoxotungstates have shown antiviral activity against a variety of enveloped RNA or DNA viruses. Herein, we synthesized a titanium-substituted-heteropolytungstate [K4(H2O)8Cl][K4(H2O)4PTi2W10O40]\u00b7NH2OH, and examined the anti-HBV activities in vitro. HepG 2.2.15 cells as a useful \u201cin vitro\u201d model are widely used for the evaluation of novel anti-HBV drugs and chosen in our experiments. The cell line contains multiple copies of HBV genome that can stably integrate into the host cell genome. The results indicate that compound 1 inhibited HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg antigens in the culture medium in a concentration-and-time dependent manner. A lower concentration of the compound 1 was required to effectively inhibit secreted HBV DNA than to inhibit secreted antigens. It is possible that the compound acts on the exported virions outer protein coats. Although the mechanisms mediating the antiviral effects by compound 1 remain unclear, we have deduced that compound 1 might block the secretion of HBV containing nucleocapsids or destabilize HBV DNA-containing nucleocapsids. Interestingly, we observed that the in vitro anti-HBV properties of compound 1 against rebound of serum HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg were more robust than those of positive group, ADV, as indicated by evaluation of treated cells 4 days after termination of treatment. This result shows that compound 1 has a sustained anti-HBV activity.",

The ADV drug competitively inhibits HBV polymerase, which is structurally similar to dATP. It is known to reduce the levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg both in vitro and in vivo by a phosphorylation event that facilitates its physical incorporation into nascent viral DNA by the activity of HBV polymerase during replication. In our study, we observed an apparent reduction in the levels of intracellular HBV-specific RNA and DNA following compound 1 treatment. These data also reveal that the anti-HBV mechanism of compound 1 may be similar to that of the nucleoside analog. Since the HBV pgRNAs were transcribed from cccDNA, we presume that HBV-specific transcripts may be affected by compound 1. It is also important to consider that the HBV pgRNA was inhibited in drug-treated cells (He et al., 2008). HBcAg, HBsAg and HBV polymerase are translated from pregenome mRNA, and the minus strand HBV DNA are transcribed from the pregenome mRNA template. In this study, it was found that compound 1 could inhibit the levels of HBcAg, HBsAg and HBV DNA protein expressed in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. These results suggested that compound 1 apparently interfered with viral pgRNA transcription in HepG 2.2.15 cells.",
