            "text": "Cruise tourism growth for 2020 predicted by [1] will not be achieved due to the recent cruise tourism crisis caused by the COVID 19 pandemic. On 14 March 2020, all cruise lines suspended their cruise operations for at least 30 days [2]. However, none of the cruise companies have filed for bankruptcy or cancelled their new builds. Therefore, the prediction of the addition of 80,000 new crew members and officers each year until 2027 remains an achievable possibility [3]. A recent study by [4] revealed that cruise ship employees are exposed to long working hours and detachment from friends and family, which leads to poor social interactions and feelings of loneliness. However, advances in information and communication technologies have led to their widespread and increased usage by employees. Internet access has become a basic necessity, a more essential element of their mundane ship life with paramount importance on their well-being and life satisfaction. Enhanced connectivity is instrumental for bolstering morale and reinforcing job satisfaction, which ultimately strengthens the capability for communication between employees and their significant others back home and hence, reduces the feeling of loneliness [5]. Moreover, Maritime Labour Convention [6] recommended rational access to the Internet with reasonable charges for services. From November 2019 to February 2020, only a handful of cruise companies (Disney Cruise Line, Holland America, Azamara, and Princess Cruises) have provided free-of-charge specialized cross-platform messaging Internet applications for their employees. Interestingly, the Seafarers Happiness Index, which covers 10 aspects of job quality, including mental and physical health and relationships at home and onboard, showed significant increases in happiness for cruise ship employees from 5.3 to 7 out of 10 [7,8].

We reviewed existing theory and previous studies on the effects of the Internet and online communication on social pressure, fear of missing out, Internet multitasking and relatedness to friends and family need satisfaction. We investigated the influence of social pressure and fear of missing out on relatedness to friends and family need satisfaction and Internet multitasking. Finally, we proposed relatedness to friends and family need satisfaction and Internet multitasking as possible catalyst influencers of perceived social support which, in the end, are the impetus towards the well-being and life satisfaction of employees. The conceptual model draws on existing theory and previous research and was empirically tested on a sample of employee internet users. Finally, we addressed the effects of socio-demographic variables (years of service on a cruise ship, working department on a cruise ship, gender, age, educational level and place of residency) on latent variables of the conceptual model. This study is exploratory in nature and presents work addressing a major research gap, given that the effects of Internet and online communication on the well-being and life satisfaction of cruise ship employees have never been empirically tested. The results of this study will contribute towards the further development of cruise tourism theory and strengthen existing theories, such as Theory of Belongingness [19], Self-Determination Theory [20], Uses and Gratification Theory [21], Conservation of Resources Theory [22] and the paradigm of Positive Psychology [23].",

These communication instruments provide social capital, information and wider perspectives [25]. In recent survey conduct by [8], the authors concluded that onboard crew members experience strong social pressure for being constantly available to their family and friends. Today, almost every cruise ship employee has a mobile device [11]. Although mobile devices allow users to be constantly available, they also create an environment that increases social pressure [29]. Moreover, the social pressure to be constantly available is strongly related to communication load [13], with a suppressing effect on well-being via social overload [30]. Based on the social norm of reciprocity in friendship and family ties, psychological tensions and social pressures may arise [16].

The hardest part for cruise ship employees is being away from home and missing so many important life events and quality time with family and friends [18]. Similar results have been reported by [5] who demonstrated in their comprehensive report how due to being uncontactable at sea, seafarers miss key life events. Cruise ship employees are fully aware that work-life on a cruise ship comes with a great burden [31]. However, they are not willing to tolerate any lack of connectivity [8]. Internet and online communication are closely linked to fear of missing out [32]. Fear of missing out is defined as \u201ca pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent\u201d [33]. Thus, we can conclude based on Compensatory Internet Use Theory [34] that individuals who feel that their life needs are not fulfilled and that they are missing important life events and social motivation will experience strong stimulation to use online communication and social networking sites. Based on the theoretical background, literature review and empirical findings, the following hypothesis was derived:",

Based on Self-Determination Theory [20], relatedness to friends and family need satisfaction is one of three basic psychological needs that foster healthy self-regulation and promote mental and physical health. Opportunities to experience positive feelings of proximity and affection with family and friends at home through the use of online communications benefits seafarers and their friends and family [5]. Interestingly, in the latest survey conducted by [11], although provisions of internet access for personal use had positively affected seafarer mental health and morale, home-related anxieties have remained the same, despite speculation that increased communications with family might generate more anxieties. The effects of the Internet and online communication and relatedness to friends and family need satisfaction remain unclear [35]. Previous studies have shown that internet and online communication are mainly linked to positive outcomes of relatedness to friends and family need satisfaction [36,37]. Few studies have demonstrated the opposite [25,38]. Thus, based on literature review, theory and empirical findings, we put forward the following hypothesis:",

A recent study conducted by [13] showed how computer-meditated communication is portrayed and influenced by robust rules of conduct, where communication arrangements are under constant social pressure. Interestingly, within seafarers, social pressure has shown a strong influence on their work-life at sea due to their social isolation, imbalanced family life, separation from home, family and friends, and lack of free onboard communication facilities [40]. Moreover, relatedness proposes that cruise ship employees need to feel connected with their family and friends at home [5,9,18]: when employees feel satisfied with this need, they experience higher levels of work engagement and well-being. Most employees own smartphones and experience social pressure to make themselves available to friends and family at home, thereby satisfying needs for relatedness. Online communications induced by social pressure and relatedness to friends and family needs satisfaction has been directly linked with significant effects on user life satisfaction [41].

Interestingly, online communication and social media are closely linked to fear of missing out [13]; 56% of U.S. social media users suffer from fear of missing out [43]. Thus, tensions related to social relationships may be the prevailing cause for the fear of missing out [44]. The Uses and Gratifications Theory provides us with pragmatic theoretical lenses instrumental in understanding underlying motives and multitasking behaviours [45]. The theory proposes that hidden roots of social and psychological needs create certain expectations from various media, which guides users towards specific models of media exposure, culminating in need gratification [46]. Looking at the advantages of online communications to those living and working at sea, fear of missing out has a significant impact; 75% of crew members need to be connected with the outside world, and 63% would leave their current company to join some other that would provide better onboard connectivity [5]. Previous research also showed that higher levels of fear of missing out had an impact on a higher tendency to internet multitask [33]. Cruise ship employees have long working hours and rarely go ashore; the tendency to internet multitask leads to some occupational injuries [4].

The digital world is doused with ever-growing social network sites that are changing the online behaviour of digital technology users but also how human beings interact with one another in real life [48]. Moreover, human beings are social animals [49] in need of relatedness to friends and family, regardless of recent technological advancements. Relatedness comes in the form of affective needs, which tend to intensify delightful and affecting experiences, and social needs that tend to bolster existing connections with family and friends [50]. Thus, the need for relatedness is a feeling of satisfaction that comes from being a connected part of a community where individuals manifest a willingness to care about each other [51]. Being away from their homes in an isolated environment [52], cruise ship employees are constantly looking for social support [53].

The main reasons for multitasking are social interactions with friends and family and information seeking [45]. Cruise ship employees are most often in different time zones than their friends and family. This leaves them with a limited time frame for online communication and significantly lowers the opportunities for giving and receiving much needed social support. Moreover, cruise ship employees are under extreme time pressure due to long working hours [4]; this is when individuals perceive that if they engage in internet multitasking, they would be efficient [45]. However, the effects of internet multitasking on retention of information during online messaging and cognitive load, showed significant retention loss among simultaneous multitasks [55]. Similarly, internet multitasking has been associated with lower gratification and perception memory achievement and sensitivity and moderate standard bias [56]. Moreover, different types of multitasking have robust effects on task performance. Task performance significantly decreased when the given task was a secondary task, when a neurological obstruction was high, and when the behavioural reaction was present [57]. Thus, based on literature review and taking in consideration the conflicting empirical results of Internet multitasking effect on perceived social support, and bearing in mind the importance of perceived social support for cruise ship employees, the following hypothesis is derived: ",

Moreover, if a persons\u2019 social context is supportive of significant relationships, then these individuals encounter elevated feelings towards psychological needs, which can be satisfied through social synergy [41]. Social support has four dominant aspects in the creation of well-being and life satisfaction: main effect (adding particular supplementary function to mental health), mediating effect (intervening in relations between its precursors and health results), indirect effect (preventing disorders by framing mental health) and moderating effect (lowering the risk of any mental health-related components) [59]. Previous studies have shown that the Internet and online communication have a positive effect on social capital [60] where social capital is an antecedent of social support [59]. Internet and online communication are bonding and bridging social capital [38], which are of paramount importance for satisfying the social support need of cruise ship employees who tend to use online communication to contact geographically dispersed close friends and family [5]. Thus, social support plays multiple roles in individuals\u2019 well-being and life satisfaction [59]. Considering the importance of well-being and life satisfaction of employees, based on literature review and empirical findings, we put forward the following hypotheses:",

Psychological well-being is related to ones\u2019 feelings and evaluations about their life [61]. Moreover, well-being is seen as a psychological well-being that develops based on the eudaimonic dimension of well-being [62] and as happiness that is built around life satisfaction based on the hedonic dimension of well-being [63]. In the context of cruise ship employees, well-being is a fusion of eudaimonic (efficiency) and hedonic (thrill) dimensions. Interestingly, Gibson et al. [64] argues how due to work-life time constraints, task assignments and job anxiety, employees experience poor well-being. Moreover, Radi\u0107 [18] questions the life satisfaction and well-being of employees who are economic gladiators in pursuit of an unobtainable economic freedom. Thus, Moore [65] calls cruise ships \u201cmisery machines\u201d where in recent years, as Walker [66,67] point out, there has been a substantial increase in suicide rates due to the poor well-being of employees. Interestingly, perceived social support from online communication has had a positive effect on well-being [5,8]. Social network sites have provided ambient awareness that increases the well-being of its users [68].",

The post-positivistic paradigm was adopted in this study because as [71] argues, the post-positivistic paradigm takes into consideration the fact that in human behaviour studies, observations are imperfect with potential inaccuracies; thus, all theories could be amended. Action research strategy allows the research to use different models of contemporary knowledge in solving genuine industry issues and applying obtained results outside the boundaries of the study [72]. Thus, action research strategy was used. The research model was evaluated using a cross-sectional survey and covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). CB-SEM allows testing and validation of current theories and comparisons of different theories [73]. In summary, this study used a deductive approach followed by a cross-sectional time horizon and quantitative techniques for data collection. ",

The survey was online from 24 August to 1 December 2019, and the final sample consisted of 532 cruise ship employees (see Table 1). The sample comprised 328 males and 195 females from different geographical areas (43.8% from Europe, 20.3% from North America, 16.4% from Southeast Asia, 7.3% from South America, 4.6% from Central America, 4.2% from Africa, and 3.4% from Australia). Most respondents were between 31\u201340 years old (50.9%) followed by respondents 21\u201330 years old (27.7%) and 41\u201350 years old (11.9%). Among the participants, 49.5% were employed in the hotel department, 32.9% were from the deck and technical department, and 17.6% were from the entertainment department. Most (45.9%) had worked in the industry for over six years. A large share of respondents had a bachelor\u2019s degree (57.7%). This extreme unrepresentative value was related to the convenience sampling method. Overall, the sample was a very good representation of employee demographics [74].",

Because social interaction through the Internet and online communication are of paramount importance for cruise ship employees [5], accomplishing this pursuit is a way towards well-being and life satisfaction. This conception is supported by results from [7,8], who reported that a recently developed free-of-charge specialized cross-platform messaging Internet application (by a handful of cruise companies) had an immediate impact on the happiness index of employees by increasing to 32% from Q2/2019 to Q4/2019.

First, working and living on a cruise ship, carries a heavy burden where cruise ship employees are detached from their family and friends at home [9] and their main communication instruments are the Internet, social networking sites and online communications [5]. Thus, although this study is of an exploratory and pioneering nature regarding the effects of internet communication on employee well-being and life satisfaction, this study was founded on well-known theories. Overall, the results are consistent with the Theory of Belongingness [19], the Self-Determination Theory [20], the Uses and Gratification Theory [21] and the Conservation of Resources Theory [22] and confirmed previous studies that reported positive effects of the Internet and online communication on social pressure on fear of missing out [5,11]; relatedness to friends and family needs satisfaction [18]; fear of missing out on internet multitasking [13]; relatedness to friends and family needs satisfaction and perceived social support [8]; and life satisfaction [5]. Intriguingly, the results did not confirm positive effects of internet and online communication on relatedness to friends and family needs satisfaction, internet multitasking on perceived social support, and perceived social support on well-being.

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, this study utilized a cross-sectional time horizon; there is space for potential causality and reciprocal relationships among components [88]. Future studies should use a longitudinal time horizon to investigate the effects of the Internet and online communication on well-being and life satisfaction during various stages of cruise ship employee contracts. Second, common method bias is expected in this study due to self-reported answers collected from employees who agreed to participate in the survey. To lessen this challenge, a cautiously composed and validated survey was used following the suggestion of [89]. As such, participant anxiety related to giving right or wrong answers was at least reduced to its lowest possible level, if not completely avoided. Nevertheless, components that were used in this study could only be measured by particular, authentic impressions of employees. Third, participants in this study were recruited via the Facebook group \u201cCrew Center\u201d. Thus, the sample is not representative of the general population of all cruise ship employees who use the Internet and online communications because many cruise ship employees are not members of the aforementioned group and as such are underrepresented. The fourth limitation is related to the sampling method, i.e., the convenience sample method. This method could have limited the generalizability of the overall findings. The fifth limitation is related to the research model. Even though components showed satisfactory levels of validity and reliability, component constituents should be tested in future work on wider populations of employees. The sixth limitation is the quantitative analyses that were used to evaluate research data. Future studies could mix qualitative and quantitative techniques to obtain comprehensive knowledge about the effects of internet and online communication on well-being and life satisfaction of cruise ship employees. Taking into consideration these limitations, the results of this exploratory study cannot be generalized and should be judged with limited and careful interpretation. ",
