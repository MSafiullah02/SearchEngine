Human-infecting HEV strains (Orthohepevirus A) include human-restricted and enzootic genotypes. Viruses in the Orthohepevirus A species also infect rabbits (HEV-3ra), camels, and swine. Using a selection-informed method, we dated the origin of the Orthohepevirus genus at least 21 million years ago, whereas the Orthohepevirus A species originated in Asia, most likely from a humaninfecting ancestor that existed~4500 to 6800 years ago. In this period, the appearance of large human settlements probably facilitated HEV emergence and spread. The earliest events in Orthohepevirus A evolutionary history involved the separation of the enzootic and human-restricted genotypes, as well as the split of the camel-infecting genotypes, which occurred during the time-frame of camel domestication. The place and timing of HEV-3ra divergence also correspond to the circumstances of rabbit domestication. This study clarifies the origin and historical events underlying HEV dispersal.",

Phylogenetic analyses of HEV-3 and HEV-4 sequences from humans and swine revealed no clustering by host species 3 . This observation, and the ability of viruses derived from swine to infect nonhuman primates 1 , suggest that pig-infecting HEV-3 and HEV-4 can readily cross the species barrier and infect humans. Likewise, cynomolgus macaques can be infected with rabbit HEV, and a human HEV strain closely related to HEV-3ra was isolated, suggesting inter-species transmission of the virus from rabbits to humans 4, 5 . Recently, the identification of HEV-7 in a patient who regularly consumed camel meat and milk suggested that this genotype is also able to infect our species 6 . To summarize, whereas it seems that all Orthohepeviruses A are transmissible to humans, experimental infection with humanderived HEV-1 and HEV-2 strains indicated that these viruses have a limited host range, which is virtually limited to primates 1 . HEV genotypes are therefore usually referred to as enzootic (HEV-3 and 4) or human-restricted/ anthropotropic (HEV-1 and 2).",

GARD uses phylogenetic incongruence among segments in an alignment to detect the best-fit number and location of recombination breakpoints and evaluates the statistical significance of putative breakpoints through Kishino-Hasegawa tests. Because we detected one statistically significant (P < 0.01) breakpoint, two subregions, Region-1 (Reg-1) and Region-2 (Reg-2) were used in all analyses. In particular, Reg-1 includes the coding portion showing good alignment quality located 5\u2032 of the recombination breakpoint (Fig. 1c) . Reg-2 covers the helicase and RdRp domains in ORF1 plus the ORF2 region that shows no overlap with ORF3 ( Fig. 1c) . To increase the alignment length and, consequently, the confidence in phylogenetic reconstruction 24 , the helicase domain was included even though an alternative reading frame ORF (ORF4) was described (Fig. 1c) ; however ORF4 was only reported for HEV-1 25 . The ORF1 and ORF2 segments were concatenated.",

The location of this breakpoint corresponds to those previously identified using other methods and HEV sequence sets 39, 40 , suggesting that the two regions defined by the breakpoint have distinct evolutionary histories.

The MRCA of HEV-1 and HEV-2 were inferred to have originated in South/South-East Asia (Fig. 2b) .

Previous analyses focusing on the enzootic HEV strains dated the origin of genotype 4 in the Twentieth Century (1909, lower-bound estimate 1871) 46 , whereas different estimates were provided for genotype 3, with tMRCAs ranging from 320 to 199 ya 41, 42 . A study that analyzed HEV strains available in 2010 reached similar conclusions, with tMRCAs of 265-342 and 130-266 ya for genotypes 3 and 4, respectively 7 . In that analysis, the whole HEV phylogeny had a tMRCA of 536 ya, with a lower bound estimate of 1344 ya. The authors however noted that, because of sparse sampling and unaccounted variation in substitution rates, their dating strategy could have underestimated the true ages of these viral lineages 7 . Whereas the problem of incomplete sampling also applies to analyses herein, as several extant HEV lineages may remain undescribed and many others may have gone extinct, we applied a method that at least partially corrects for temporal variation in substitution rates. This approach was previously used to revise the evolutionary time frames of other RNA viruses, which resulted much deeper than those obtained with classical models 34, 45 . Although this method accounts for the effect of purifying selection, and we detected limited evidence of substitution saturation, we most likely failed to fully correct for time-dependent substitution rate variation 49 . As a consequence, the time frames we report may still underestimate the true timing of Orthohepevirus evolution.",

Indeed, when we performed molecular dating with models that do not account for selection (BEAST or LSD with GTR branch lengths), the tMRCA for the Orthohepevirus A phylogeny was not so different from that obtained by Purdy and coworkers 7 . Clearly, an additional source of diversity from that previous study derives from the dataset, as Purdy et al. performed their analyses in 2010, when several HEV genotypes (i.e., HEV-5 to HEV-8) had still to be discovered. As for phylogeography, our results are consistent with previous reports indicating a European origin for HEV-3 41, 42 . Conversely, data for HEV-4 are more difficult to interpret. Recently, this genotype was shown to have originated in Japan, although the skewed sampling of HEV-4 sequences was not accounted for 46 . We also obtained evidence of an East-Asian origin for this genotype using both BEAST and BBM. However, resampling with omission of character states for subsets of East-Asian strains yielded different results depending on the analyzed region and assigned HEV-4 to either West or South/South-East Asia. Overall, these data suggest that additional unbiased sampling of HEV-4 sequences will be required to correctly infer to geographic origin of this genotype (see also below). Data herein indicate that Orthohepevirus A most likely originated in East Asia, from a human-infecting ancestor that existed~6800 to~4500 ya. This time frame corresponds to a period when intensive, sedentary agriculture (mainly rice and millet) was fully developed and spreading across China and neighboring regions [50] [51] [52] . The same period witnessed a rapid population growth in several East and South-East Asian regions and the appearance of relatively large human settlements 53 . These conditions, most probably characterized by the close proximity of habitation areas and waste deposits, as well as by the frequent contamination of drinking water 54 , may have facilitated the emergence of HEV strains with epidemiological features similar to extant human-restricted genotypes. Domesticated pigs were already present in China by 6000 BCE 55 , although husbandry practices probably intensified around 5000 to 3000 BCE 52, 56 . The close contact between humans and pigs was possibly responsible for the origin of the enzootic HEV strains, which represent one of the earliest splits in Orthohepevirus A phylogenies.",

This observation is in line with a recent report that, based on HEV-7 genetic diversity and broad geographic distribution, suggested a long evolution of Orthohepevirus A in dromedary camels 57 . We dated the split of HEV-7 and HEV-8 from other genotypes in a wide time frame ranging from 4291 BCE to 1416 BCE (plus confidence intervals). This period encompasses the time of domestication of Bactrian camels (earliest evidences dating around 4500-3500 BCE) and dromedary camels (1000-2000 BCE) 58, 59 . The place and timing of HEV-3/ HEV-3ra divergence also correspond remarkably well with the circumstances of rabbit domestication, which started in France around 600 CE 60 . However, the correspondence between domestication processes and divergence dates does not necessarily imply that the animal viruses originated from human transmission events. Husbandry practices commonly create animal colonies isolated from the other wildlife and living in crowded facilities. These conditions may have favored the spread of pre-existing animal viruses and their divergence into specific genotypes. With respect to phylogeographic analyses, we mention that an important limitation of our study is the underlying bias in sequence origin. We addressed this problem by both resampling with omission of character states for subsets of Asian strains and by analysis of an independent set of sequences which were selected to be equally representative of the continents. However, these approaches cannot compensate for areas where very few sequences were reported such as Central Asia and the Middle East. Sampling efforts in these regions will be pivotal to refine the geographic origin of HEV.",

            "text": "Finally, we note that the identification of humans as the likely ancestral hosts for Orthohepevirus A is consistent with the observation that most, if not all, HEV genotypes can infect our species. This is not merely a result of ecological factors, as inter-species transmission experiments confirmed the strict host specificity of HEV-1 and HEV-2 1 . Clearly, our inference concerning an ancestral human host for extant Orthohepevirus A strains does not exclude the possibility that humans acquired HEV through cross-species transmission from other animals. However, known Orthohepeviruses that infect mammals and birds are distantly related to Orthohepevirus A, suggesting that none of them represents the source of human-infecting HEV. To gain insight into the time of origin of the Orthohepevirus genus we exploited a strategy that was previously applied to Coronaviruses and is based on extrapolating over branch lengths obtained under different models 45 . In the case of Coronaviruses the authors obtained time estimates that were broadly consistent with the divergence time of birds and mammals, suggesting co-speciation of mammal-infecting and birdinfecting Coronaviruses with their hosts 45 . Conversely, the estimates we obtained for the tMRCA of the Orthohepevirus genus are much shallower than the divergence times of the host species that these viruses infect. Although these time frames may represent severe underestimates, the lack of virus-host co-speciation is also supported by the poor congruence of the viral and host phylogenies. Thus, ancient events of co-evolution and host-shifts probably contributed to originate extant Orthohepevirus species. Several Orthohepeviruses have been described only recently 1 and the current sampling of this viral genus is most likely limited in terms of host species. For instance, anti-HEV antibodies were detected in different animal species such as sheep, horses, cats, and dogs. Although no viral RNA has been isolated from these animals, it is likely that additional mammalian and non-mammalian HEV species or strains exist 1 . Analyses of more diverse potential hosts may thus shed further light into the ultimate origin of Orthohepevirus A.",
