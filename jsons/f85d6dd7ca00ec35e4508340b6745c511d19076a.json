For stroke, this theory is supported by the relative preservation of MT, which is reserved for patients with more severe stroke.

To provide a geographic distribution, we describe the hospital location by United States Census region. 8 Results We included data from 65 hospitals, of which 55 were academic medical centers and 20 had less than 200 beds, 14 had 200-499 beds, and 21 had \u2265 500 beds. There were 17 hospitals in the South, 6 in the Northeast, 11 in the West, and 31 in the Midwest. We identified 51,246 hospitalizations with stroke (42,780 AIS, 8,466 hemorrhagic), 1,043 MTs for AIS, 836 tPA administrations for AIS, 36,551 hospitalizations with ACS, 3,925 PCIs for ACS. In February 2020, compared to the average of February 2018 and 2019, there was an increase in all outcomes. In March 2020, compared to the average of March 2018 and 2019, there were decreases in stroke (18.5%), tPA (3.3%), ACS (7.5%), and PCI (14.7%) (Table 1,",
