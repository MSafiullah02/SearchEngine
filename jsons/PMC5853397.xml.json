The Memphis, Tennessee, site was excluded from this analysis as this site did not enroll controls. Children hospitalized with clinical CAP (ie, acute infection as defined by fever/chills or hypothermia, leukocytosis, or leukopenia, in combination with acute respiratory illness) and radiographic CAP (based on detection of consolidation, other infiltrate, or pleural effusion) were enrolled from January 2010 to June 2012 [27]. Children undergoing elective outpatient surgery were enrolled as controls from February 2011 (at the Utah site) or March 2011 (at the Nashville, Tennessee, site; hereafter the \u201cTennessee site\u201d) to June 2012. Detailed laboratory and clinical information was collected per the EPIC study protocol (Supplementary Methods) [27]. All patients, controls, or their caregivers were asked to provide informed consent or assent as appropriate.

This association was strongest when HBoV but no other respiratory pathogen was detected (OR, 9.6 [95% CI, 2.2\u201342.7]), especially in young children, although comparison of ORs is complicated by wide 95% CIs in these sensitivity analyses. Even though HBoV prevalence at the Tennessee site was approximately 3-fold lower than at the Utah site, the strength of the association between HBoV and CAP was similar at both sites and consistent across a number of sensitivity analyses. In contrast, detection of HBoV genomic DNA was not significantly associated with CAP after adjustment for age, season, and codetection of other pathogens. While high HBoV DNA load was associated with CAP, there was extensive overlap in viral loads of patients and controls. In contrast, HBoV DNA loads were consistently higher in capsid mRNA\u2013positive children than in capsid mRNA\u2013negative children.

            "text": "Since its identification a decade ago, the etiologic role of HBoV in acute RTI in children has been controversial. Numerous patients with severe or fatal pneumonia have been described in whom HBoV was the sole pathogen detected [29\u201335]. However, frequent detection in asymptomatic children and common codetection with other respiratory viruses have led to questions regarding its pathogenic role [6, 9, 36\u201338]. Studies linking HBoV with respiratory disease have been criticized for relying on cross-sectional designs, convenience samples, and inadequate control groups and for failing to confidently exclude alternate pathogens as the cause of symptoms [9, 36]. Potential confounders include incomplete matching on age, sampling method and time of year/season, different protocols for testing of other respiratory pathogens, and selection of controls with increased risk for HBoV infection [6, 9, 10, 39, 40]. Much of the controversy is related to difficulties in identifying acute HBoV infections and excluding other potential etiologies. Because HBoV can be shed for up to 12 months and can be reactivated upon infection with other pathogens, detection of genomic HBoV DNA alone is not likely to be suitable to identify acute and clinically relevant infections [6\u20138, 10, 14, 16, 29, 41]. In this context, in this study the weak association of HBoV DNA in the unadjusted analysis with CAP (OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.0\u20132.0]), which was further attenuated in the adjusted analysis (aOR, 1.2 [95% CI, .6\u20132.4]), is consistent with the prior literature and demonstrates the limitations of viral DNA as target.",

Viremia has been detected during acute infections in some studies but has not been widely studied [38]. Seroconversion, defined as immunoglobulin M positivity, an increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer, or an increase in IgG avidity, can identify acute infections but requires serial collection of blood specimens, limiting its clinical utility [9, 42, 43]. High HBoV loads in upper respiratory tract specimens have been associated with acute infections or more-severe disease, and thresholds have been proposed (eg, 104 copies/mL) [9, 19, 20, 36, 38, 44]. However, viral loads in patients are highly variable and overlap significantly with those in controls, limiting the usefulness of this approach [2, 16, 19, 21]. In addition, defining thresholds is difficult, even in homogenous specimens, such as plasma or serum, as viral loads differ between test methods, requiring complex standardization [45, 46]. It is not surprising that viral load determination has led to inconsistent results in nonhomogenous specimens, such as respiratory secretions [47].",

            "text": "A recent longitudinal study by Martin et al demonstrated that incident infections, defined as infections involving primary shedding of HBoV DNA, are associated with respiratory symptoms in infants, suggesting that HBoV is a true pathogen [14]. In a small study, Christensen et al detected HBoV capsid mRNA in the respiratory tract of 33 of 133 HBoV DNA\u2013positive children with RTI but 0 of 28 HBoV DNA\u2013positive asymptomatic children, suggesting capsid mRNA may be a marker of acute symptomatic infection [23]. Serial testing of a single patient demonstrated that viral capsid mRNA was detectable only during acute infection (ie, within 10 days of onset of symptoms), while HBoV genomic DNA persisted for an additional period of approximately 6 weeks. Studies with other parvoviruses (ie, human parvovirus B19 and canine parvovirus type 2) also indicated that capsid mRNA detection might be a marker for incident infections [24\u201326]. Our results support this notion, demonstrating a strong association of HBoV capsid mRNA with CAP, especially in children who tested negative for a large battery of other respiratory pathogens. In contrast to the earlier study of HBoV capsid mRNA, the present study is much larger, includes parallel testing for HBoV DNA and capsid mRNA, and used combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. In the present study, all patients had radiographically confirmed CAP, and controls were surveyed for the development of respiratory symptoms in the weeks following specimen collection. Consistent with acute infection, detection of HBoV capsid mRNA was also correlated with higher viral DNA loads in both the present and previous studies (Figure 3C) [48]. Taken together, this large, prospective, multicenter case control study expands on the previous study by confirming a stronger association of HBoV capsid mRNA detection than HBoV genomic DNA detection with CAP.",

To address this, we designed the RT-PCR assay for HBoV capsid mRNA assay to span a splice site that removes approximately 2 kb of HBoV RNA. As a result, cross-detection of HBoV DNA is almost eliminated (Figure 1). Performance of HBoV capsid mRNA detection tests could be further improved to eliminate cross-detection of viral DNA and optimize analytical and clinical sensitivity. Although we used a multisite design, controls were only available from 2 of the EPIC study sites and were not enrolled during the entire study period. We performed sensitivity analyses that demonstrated that these limitations did not bias results. Controls were older than children with CAP, but we adjusted for this in the analysis. In future studies, age-matched controls will help further reduce the potential confounding effect of age. Children were enrolled in the EPIC study during a 30-month period so that this study only covered 3 respiratory seasons. Despite the size of the EPIC study, we only detected 27 patients with HBoV mRNA (2.1% prevalence), potentially leading to small-sample-size bias (for comparison, the prevalences of other respiratory viruses in EPIC were 28% for respiratory syncytial virus, 27% for rhinovirus, 13% for metapneumovirus, 11% for adenovirus, 7% for parainfluenza virus, 7% for influenza virus, and 5% for coronavirus). Last, there is the potential for unmeasured confounders. Future studies across additional geographic regions and respiratory seasons will be required to confirm results.",

In addition to strengthening the association between detection of HBoV replication and CAP, our results suggest that detection of viral replication through RT-PCR might provide a better target for diagnosing primary HBoV disease and a tool for studying the etiologic role of HBoV.",
