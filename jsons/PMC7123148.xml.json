When on the ground, fans recirculate cooled or conditioned air throughout the cabin. When the engines are off, ventilation is provided in one of two ways: Either an auxiliary power unit runs the cabin ventilation system or preconditioned air is supplied by connecting a ground air-conditioning unit to an air manifold. In some aircraft, no fresh air is taken in until pressurization is begun at altitude. However, older military transport aircraft (such as the C-130 Hercules) use pressurized air from the engines for ventilation whether on the ground or aloft. At altitude, compressed air enters continually while air is vented overboard via an outflow valve. First-generation jet airliners (e.g., Boeing 707s, Boeing 727s, DC-9s) and most military transports use 100% ambient (fresh) air for cabin supply [7].",

With the longitudinal design, air circulates from the aircraft skin in the midsection to outflow valves either fore or aft.

First, most cabins feature a flow design that is both circumperipheral and laminar, with air entering overhead, flowing down the sides, and exiting through vents above the floor. Second, they have relatively high air exchange rates, typically ranging from 15 to 20 exchanges per hour. This exceeds both the 12 air exchanges per hour that maintain air quality in modern office buildings and the 12 exchanges per hour recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the hospital isolation rooms of patients with active tuberculosis [11]. Unfortunately, the purging of air within the cabin may not always be uniform because of the laminar flow design. There may be decreased air circulation in fore and aft areas, resulting in stagnant zones; animal studies demonstrate that increased ventilation decreases airborne transmission in confined spaces [12, 13]. It is important to remember that ventilation alone is not sufficient to prevent all transmission of airborne pathogens [14].",

The two aircraft evaluated were the Lockheed Martin C-130E Hercules (the aircraft used for most tactical AE) and the Boeing 707\u2013347C. At the time, the aviation engineering knowledge of ventilation and air pressure changes on these aircraft was extensive. The movement of smoke particles was observed, and the dispersion of aerosolized spores of a nonpathogenic organism (Bacillus subtilis var. globigii) was assayed at multiple cabin sites under various pressure and ventilation conditions. Results of both smoke and spore studies suggested that the optimal location for placing a highly infections patient in the 707 would be the left rear of the cabin. When the aircraft was pressurized and the forward outflow valve was closed, contamination was largely restricted to the rear area, placing the flight crew at minimal risk if they stayed forward.",

Approximately 3% of the spores released in the aft cabin reached the flight deck, probably enough to transmit infection over a prolonged flight if the organism had been infectious. The relative locations of the bleed valves and outflow valve would make plastic diaphragms impractical. One conclusion of the study was that high-containment isolators would be required to evacuate patients with potentially lethal contagious diseases in a C-130. These isolators would protect the flight crew and medical workers and allow refueling stops without alarming foreign governments, which might otherwise refuse international landing clearances (Fig. 20.1). These types of isolators are still used by non-US military forces for AE transport [20]. The US military and civilian transportation services have adopted a slightly different approach as will be discussed later.",

This dedicated AE utilized extensive and unprecedented precautions to transport the patient (a German physician) from Lagos, Nigeria, to Hamburg. The patient was isolated in the rear of the cabin, and a \u201cneutral zone\u201d was created using two polyvinyl chloride partitions. The outflow valves were configured to create a longitudinal pressure gradient in the cabin so that airflow was from the forward to the aft section. Finally, to avoid microbial dissemination via recirculated air, the starboard engines were started to allow pressurization prior to boarding the patient through the aft door. After transporting the patient, the aircraft interior was fumigated with vaporized formalin for 6 hours, and there were no secondary cases.",

The mortality and communicability of Lassa fever had engendered a cautious approach to these patients in the West from both the medical and aeromedical communities. As reported above, an infected patient transported from Lagos to Germany was the sole patient on a C-141, and the patient together with the aeromedical crew were quarantined from the flight crew [22]. Perhaps the most unusual AE in history occurred when a CDC worker with Lassa fever and his wife were transported from Sierra Leone to the United States on a C-141 [42]. For lack of an isolation chamber, they were both sealed for the duration of the flight in an Apollo space capsule that had been flown from a US military warehouse in Germany.",

On at least four occasions, passengers with Lassa fever have traveled on commercial overseas flights without a single secondary case occurring [42\u201345].

However, another flight carrying four symptomatic patients led to only one secondary case, and a flight carrying a patient during incubation resulted in no additional cases [51]. Surveillance of passengers in seven flights carrying symptomatic SARS patients to the United States identified no transmission events [52]. An analysis of SARS transmission during commercial flights carrying symptomatic SARS patients to Singapore disclosed transmission in only one of three flights, for an attack rate of less than 1%.

A third patient, a nurse who contracted the disease while caring for the first Ebola patient in the United States, traveled by domestic airline before she became symptomatic [85]. There were no reported cases of Ebola transmission on any international or domestic flights. It has been postulated that enhanced travel and border health measures helped to curtail the spread of the outbreak [82]. However, an extensive review by the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General foundseveral serious deficiencies in the US Ebola screening effort [86].",
