            "text": "Considered to have immunostimulating activity, echinacea is a widely used phytomedicinal for treatment of the common cold and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). We reviewed the literature from the MEDLINE database (January 1966-July 1999), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) online database, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts Biological Sciences online database, Alt-Health Watch online database, EMBase CD-ROM database, and references from published articles, reviews, and letters to evaluate evidence from clinical trials of echinacea' s purported efficacy for treating or preventing URTIs. Twelve clinical studies published from 1961-1997 concluded that echinacea was efficacious for treating the common cold, but the results are unclear due to inherent flaws in study design. Five trials were published since 1997; two showed that echinacea lacked efficacy for treating and preventing URTI symptoms, and three concluded that it was effective in reducing the frequency, duration, and severity of common cold symptoms. Again, these results are unclear because of methodologic uncertainties, such as small populations and use of noncommercially available, nonstandardized dosage forms. Although evidence for echinacea' s efficacy is inconclusive, it appears to be safe. Patients without contraindications to it may not be dissuaded from using an appropriate preparation to treat the common cold. No acute illness is more prevalent in the United States than the common cold. 1 Adults typically suffer 2-4 colds/year and children may experience as many as 10 colds/year. The economic impact is substantial, with an estimated $1.5 billion spent annually on caring for these patients in physicians' offices and nearly $2 billion on nonprescription cough and cold treatments. 1, 2 Forty percent of time lost from jobs and 30% of absences from school can be attributed to colds. 1 Various organisms cause the cold. The singlestranded RNA rhinovirus is the most common, causing 10-40%. 1 Other viruses are coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, echoviruses, and coxsackieviruses. Colds due to rhinovirus are most prevalent in early fall and late spring, and coronavirus strains gain prevalence during winter months in the United States. 3, 4 Viral transmission most frequently occurs from the hands of donors directly or indirectly to the hands of recipients who touch their eyes or nose, the preferred viral entry sites. 3 Infection begins in the posterior adenoidal region of the nasopharynx, which contains receptor targets for the rhinovirus. 5 Viral replication peaks in 48 hours and declines, but viral shedding can continue for up to 3 weeks. 5 With infection, an inflammatory response follows that causes characteristic nasal symptoms (discharge, sneezing, stuffiness), pharyngeal symptoms (sore, scratchy throat), lower respiratory symptoms (cough, hoarseness), and constitutional symptoms (headache, fever, myalgia). 3 Currently available treatments for the common cold are limited to alleviation of symptoms. Nasal symptoms can be reduced by first-generation antihistamines and oral or topical \u2423-adrenergic agonists. 6 The most common side effects of these agents are drowsiness, nasal dryness, and rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa), respectively. Analgesics are indicated for myalgia and headache. Cough suppressants, such as codeine and dextromethorphan, and expectorants, such as guaifenesin, are typical components of anticold products, but have no efficacy in the common cold. 2",

According to a national survey, use of these therapies in 1997 ranged from 32-54% in the demographic groups examined. 7 Millions of Americans now rely on alternative products for a variety of ailments. The use of herbs by American adults increased nearly 70% in 1998, with three-fifths of consumers taking two or more products on a daily basis. 8 Another study reported that 34% of 1539 adults used at least one unconventional therapy over the previous year. 9 The number of people in the United States who used alternative therapies increased from 60 million in 1990 to 83 million in 1997. 7 For acute, self-limiting conditions such as colds, people may prefer herbal remedies because professional care is inconvenient, not readily available, or too costly. 10 Conventional treatment offers only symptomatic relief, so cold sufferers may seek alternatives for potentially improved responses. Echinacea, one of the top three selling herbal medicines in the United States, 8 has been evaluated in clinical trials for treatment and prevention of the common cold.",

[17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The primary authors of 11 of these studies concluded that echinacea was superior to control treatment. Based on a systematic assessment of methodologic quality to estimate evidence supporting these conclusions, however, echinacea's efficacy for treating or preventing URTIs or the common cold was unclear in all but 1 of the 12 studies. That study administered 900 mg/day of an ethanolic extract of E. purpurea root, which was thought to have verified efficacy for relieving URTI symptoms according to the study's design and analysis. 17 Currently, the German Commission E does not recommend use of the root of E. purpurea. Other studies contained serious methodologic flaws and had insufficient or flawed statistical analyses. Many lacked defined URTI diagnostic criteria, adequate sample sizes, randomization, description of the randomization process, analysis of baseline subject comparability, descriptions of treatment interventions, defined outcome criteria, patient blinding, evaluator blinding, and numbers of and reasons for subject withdrawal. The reviewers concluded that some evidence exists to support the proposed benefits of echinacea for treating and preventing URTIs.

Furthermore, no significant differences between treatment and placebo groups were found regarding number, severity, or duration of URTI symptoms, quality of life measures, and adverse effects. The preparations appeared to be well tolerated, as the most frequent adverse effects reported were minor gastrointestinal symptoms and headachedizziness, probably due to the ethanol component of the extract. These adverse effects occurred at a rate of less than 10% in each treatment group and were not more prevalent with echinacea than with placebo. The authors concluded that no prophylactic effect was shown, but speculated that a 10-20% relative risk reduction in time to first URTI may exist with echinacea.

The other plant preparation of E. purpurea root (29.60 mg/tablet) did not show a statistically significant mean relative reduction in complaint index scores (44.8 \u00b1 20%, p=0.060) versus placebo. These results were similar to those for the intent-totreat group. Mean relative reductions \u00b1 95% CI for Echinaforce, concentrated extract, and rootonly extract versus placebo (33.6 \u00b1 17%) were 58.7 \u00b1 10% (p=0.045), 58.1 \u00b1 11% (p=0.027), and 46.1 \u00b1 16% (p=0.133), respectively.",

The root extract was not better than placebo in reducing the mean relative reduction in complaint index scores (35.2 \u00b1 17%, p=0.271).

Also, the lower-dose Echinaforce tablets achieved nearly the same symptom reduction as the high dose of concentrated herb and root extracts. The study analyzed final symptom scores only on resolution of symptoms or after 7 days of treatment. No data were provided on the duration of symptom resolution, only that the complaint index scores decreased in 7 days or fewer. A more appropriate conclusion would be that Echinaforce and the concentrated extract reduced cold symptoms better than placebo in 7 days or fewer. Complaint index scores at day 1 or 2 of the cold are interesting as the maximum score for the most severe cold is 36, and mean scores ranged from 7.7-10.9 in the four groups reported from patient diaries and physicians. One can question if the colds were less severe than they would have been in a larger population, or that if complaint index is an appropriate instrument to assess cold severity. No validation of the subjectively determined complaint index is provided. Also, on final examination at 7 days or when the subject's symptoms had resolved to a complaint index score of 2 or less, patients receiving Echinaforce and concentrated extract were still scoring symptoms from a mean range of 2.6-5.2. This means that even though the reduction in symptoms in 7 days was better with active treatment than with placebo, patients were experiencing symptoms even after 7 days of taking the preparations. Table 1 summarizes the results of the aforementioned clinical trials evaluating echinacea.",

Serious allergic reactions involving anaphylaxis are rare, but caution is advised for patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the daisy family (sunflower seeds, ragweed). With minimal toxicity and favorable side effect profile, patients may not be dissuaded from taking echinacea unless they have an autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency viral infection, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, pregnancy, or lactation, or are receiving immunosuppressive agents. 37 Echinacea preparations have not been evaluated in children and infants, and are not recommended for them. It is difficult to offer dosing recommendations as preparations are not standardized to an active constituent. Some preparations use echinacoside as a standard; it is thought that this constituent is not active, and it is not even found in E. purpurea. 38 A reasonable recommended dosage is 2-3 ml of E. purpurea juice or 1-2 ml of an extract taken 3-4 times/day in juice or water or sublingually. 39 One hundred fifty milligrams to 300 mg of a 6.5:1 dry powdered E. purpurea extract can be taken in a solid oral dosage form 3 times/day if the juice or fluid extract cannot be tolerated. 37, 39 A tincture of 1:5 (45% ethanol) 1-5 ml 3 times/day is recommended by the British Herbal Pharmacopoeia. 40 Echinacea's immunostimulating properties may decline with continued use, so preparations should not be taken for longer than 8 consecutive weeks. 15, 37, 39 After a drug holiday, the herb may be restarted for another 8 weeks. 41 Studies evaluated here support echinacea in the treatment of a URTI, but not to prevent infection. Although the effects are not dramatic, they may be significant in some cases. The herb may be taken to decrease the time to resolution of signs and symptoms of a URTI early after symptom start; however, other factors must be considered. Trial results of one Echinacea species, extraction method, and dosage form cannot be extrapolated to a dissimilar preparation because chemical constituents may differ. From studies in the English language, it is uncertain which part of the plant (root, aerial portion), of which species (E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, E. pallida), in which formulation (squeezed sap, hydroalcoholic extract, dried powder extract, etc.) offers the most evidence for efficacy.",
