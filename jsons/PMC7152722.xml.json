In addition to the disease epidemiology, such information is essential for public health planning and strategic decision-making, prevention intervention programming and program evaluation (Bayer & Galea, 2015; Chen & Wang, 2017; Khoury, Iademarco, & Riley, 2016). Since the beginning of epidemiology and public health, two indicators most commonly used in research have been (1) the total count that informs us about the total number of persons who suffer from or died of a disease; and (2) rate that reflects the risk of a person suffering from or being died of a disease.",

When a disease becomes an epidemic and lasts for long time to affect more and more people in a population, annual count of persons who suffered from or died of the disease is used to monitor the epidemic, such as the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS or died from AIDS each years (WHO, 2018).

It is the basic data used in planning and decision-making to allocate resource for disease treatment and prevention (Bautista-Arredondo, Gadsden, Harris, & Bertozzi, 2008). For example, if a total of 1200 persons are diagnosed with cancer. Assuming that the government expenditure for treating one cancer patient per year on average is $15,000, a total of $18 million ($15,000\u22171200) every year must be allocated in the country\u2019s budget for treating all the cancer patients. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses this method to plan its Healthy People 2030 for resource allocation for all public health programs, and more details can be found at the URL: https://www.healthypeople.gov/.",

This is because given the same level of likelihood for a disease to spread, the head count of a disease will differ for countries and regions with different population sizes. A country or region with a larger population will have more people at risk of suffering from a disease than a country or region with a smaller population given the same risk level. Epidemiologists have overcome the limitation of headcount data by using the indicator rate. Methodologically, a rate is a measure that adjusts the impact of population size in assessing disease risk (Chen, 2017; Chen & Wang, 2017). Disease rates therefore provide a measure more informative than disease count for comparison across regions within a country, and across countries in the world.",

While appreciating the value and utility of the two epidemiologic indicators, we cannot overlook their limitations. Although measures of disease rate are more informative than measures of headcount with regard to informing levels of risk of a disease at the population level, both headcount and disease rate cannot address another key factor--the size of geographic areas people reside (Chen, 2017; Chen & Wang, 2017). To fill in this methodology gap, in this chapter, we will introduce a new measurement system by incorporating geographic area size into measurement. We illustrate the new measurement system using the global HIV epidemic as an example.",

For example, the number of PLWH by country is needed for resource allocation to achieve the 90-90-90 proposed by UNAIDS. If it costs on average $1000 to treat one PLWH per year, a total of $39 billion will be needed to treat all the 39 million PLWH in the world. There were 850,000 PLWH in China in 2015, which meant China needs $850 million per year to treat these infected persons.",

In addition to risk factors, the total number of PLWH in a country is directly related to the population size. For example, in 2015, there were 850,000 PLWH in China and 830,000 in Brazil (see Appendix to this chapter for detailed data). If larger number of PLWH meant higher risk of HIV transmission, people in China may face a higher risk than people in Brazil. However, the population of Brazil was 208 million, only about 15% of 1.4 billion, the total population in China. We cannot determine whether the risk of HIV transmission is higher in China or in Brazil using only the measure of total headcount of PLWH.",

In our 4D measurement system, this population-based measure is termed as p rate (Chen & Wang, 2017). Epidemiologically, a p rate is more accurate than a headcount to assess between-country differences in risk of HIV transmission because it quantitatively adjusts the differences in population sizes. Following the same example in the previous paragraph, the p rate for Brazil was 3.993/1000 population, 6.4 times higher than 0.630/1000, the p rate for China. Therefore, based on the p rates, we can conclude that the risk of HIV transmission is 6.4 times higher in Brazil than in China.",

If people from the two countries reside on a same size of a geographic area (say, like Swaziland), the risk of HIV transmission would be 113 times (19,440,000/172,000) higher in Swaziland than in Mexico. To consider difference in geographic area size like the p rate for population size, a new and geographic area-based measure has been developed and named as g rate (Chen, 2017; Chen & Wang, 2017).",

While a p rate provides a measure that has epidemiologically adjusted the confounding from different population sizes; a g rate provides another measure that has epidemiologically controlled the confounding from the different geographic area sizes. With a g rate, the significance of geographic areas in disease epidemiology (Sattenspiel, 2009) can be assessed quantitatively.",

As the name suggests, a pg rate of a health event for a country is defined as the ratio of total count of the event over both the total population and the total geographic area of the country.

High g rates suggest greater potentials for close contact between the HIV infected and uninfected persons. Therefore, given the same headcount and p rate, risk of HIV spreading will be higher in countries with high g rates. Singapore provides a best example. This country would be low at HIV transmission if the total number of PLWH (only 4900) and p rate (0.894/1000) were used; however, it became a high-risk country and ranked number 6 in the world when assessed using g rate (126.1 per 1000,000 population per 100 km2).",

Given the same number of PLWH and the same p rate, the risk will be lower for HIV transmission in countries with smaller g rate since small g rate means longer distances for inter-personal contacts. This is consistent with the rural-urban differences in the HIV epidemic with more infections and quicker growths in urban areas where people crowd together than in rural areas where people reside sparsely (Mnyika et al., 1994). Data generated using g rates of PLWH provide direct evidence supporting the role of geographic area in disease epidemiology in general (Sattenspiel, 2009).",

It is an index of the number of PLWH in a given number of population and a geographic area. Thus, pg rates provide the most effective measure for cross-country comparison to assess the risk of transmission of HIV as well as many other infectious diseases. Based on the definition, pg rate will be high for countries with large number of headcount of persons suffering from or died of a disease, but a small population and small geographic area. For example, pg rate was 993.861 for Swaziland, which means roughly 1000 PLWH in every million population residing in an area of 100 km2; while the corresponding pg rate was 0.007 for China, indicating much lower risk of HIV transmission. Given all other conditions the same, the likelihood for HIV (or any other infectious disease) to transmit from one to another in a place with small area and a large number of populations will be greater than in a place with large area and small number of populations.",
