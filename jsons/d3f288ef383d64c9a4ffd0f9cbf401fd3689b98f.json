Whether these remain risk factors for the persistence of asthma out to adolescence is not established. Objective: We sought to define the relationships among specific viral illnesses and the type and timing of aeroallergen sensitization with the persistence of asthma into adolescence. Methods: A total of 217 children were followed prospectively from birth to age 13 years. The etiology and timing of viral wheezing illnesses during the first 3 years of life were assessed along with patterns of allergen sensitization. The associations between viral wheezing illnesses, presence and pattern of aeroallergen sensitization, and asthma diagnosis at age 13 years were evaluated. Results: When adjusted for all viral etiologies, wheezing with RV (odds ratio 5 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.1), but not respiratory syncytial virus (odds ratio 5 1.0; 95% CI, 0.4-2.3), was associated with asthma at age 13 years. Age of aeroallergen sensitization also influenced asthma risk; 65% of children sensitized by age 1 year had asthma at age 13 years, compared with 40% of children not sensitized at age 1 year but sensitized by age 5 years, and 17% of children not sensitized at age 5 years. Early life aeroallergen sensitization and RV wheezing had additive effects on asthma risk at adolescence. Conclusions: In a high-risk birth cohort, the persistence of asthma at age 13 years was most strongly associated with outpatient wheezing illnesses with RV and aeroallergen sensitization in early life.

            "text": "The inception of asthma has been the focus of research by multiple groups over the past several decades. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] A clear link has been established between both early life viral wheezing illnesses and allergic sensitization and the risk of developing childhood asthma. The etiologic role of specific viruses in the development of asthma has been investigated by our group 7 and others. 8, 9 Initial investigations in this area focused on the role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections and the risk for asthma and allergic disease. 8, 10 The role of human rhinovirus (RV) infections in early life wheezing was underappreciated because of poor growth of RV using standard culture techniques. However, with the advent of molecule-based techniques, 11 RV has now been well established to play an important role in early life viral wheezing. In the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) birth cohort, we have reported that wheezing illnesses with RV in the first 3 years of life are the most significant predictor of asthma by age 6 years. 7, 12 Moreover, the combined influence of early life viral wheezing and aeroallergen sensitization has been clearly linked to an even greater risk for the development of asthma by our group and others. 7, 13 We have reported an important sequential relationship whereby allergic sensitization precedes viral wheezing, most notably with RV infections, in this developmental pathway. 14 Furthermore, the link between RV wheezing and subsequent asthma can be modified by other factors, such as genetic susceptibility at 17q21. 15 Although the role of viruses and allergic sensitization has been clearly implicated in the onset of asthma, their role in the persistence of asthma into later childhood and early adolescence has not been as well studied. The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study group previously reported that early life wheezing with RSV had a pronounced impact on early school-age asthma, but that this association dissipated over time and was no longer significant by age 13 years. 8 With regard to allergic sensitization, the question of type and magnitude of aeroallergen sensitization and the resultant impact on childhood asthma have been evaluated, 16 and longitudinal observations have shown that a differential effect on asthma inception based on the timing and Abbreviations used COAST: Childhood Origins of Asthma OR: Odds ratio RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus RV: Rhinovirus type of sensitization exists. 16 Specifically, early sensitization to multiple allergens confers the greatest risk of subsequent asthma inception and morbidity. 16, 17 However, the natural history of these relationships out to adolescence has not been characterized.",

Next, classification trees were fit with asthma at year 13 as the response and the number of sensitizations at each year as potential predictors, using the R package rpart (http://CRAN.R-project.org/ package5rpart); separate trees were fit using each imputed data set, and also a data set that averaged (median) the imputed number of sensitizations across all imputations. To avoid overfitting, cost-complexity pruning using cross-validation was performed on each tree. The consensus tree model was a 3-node tree formed by first splitting the population by the number of sensitizations by year 5 (0 vs 11), then splitting the 11 node according to the number of sensitizations by year 1 (0 vs 11).

Because these data would suggest that the impact of RSV lower respiratory tract illnesses in early life on future asthma risk is greatest during early school age, we sought to determine whether similar developmental relationships were also true for RV wheezing illnesses in early life. Using a model to adjust for early life viral wheezing illnesses with RV, RSV, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4, influenza types A and B, coronaviruses, metapneumoviruses, adenovirus, and enteroviruses, we noted a persistent significant association with RV wheezing illnesses in early life and asthma at all ages evaluated out to 13 years. The OR for a diagnosis of asthma at 13 years following a wheezing viral illness with RV in the first 3 years of life was 3.3. In contrast, we confirmed the Tucson findings that the impact of RSV on subsequent asthma risk lessened with time.",

            "text": "It is of interest that both allergic sensitization and RV-induced wheezing illnesses in early life increase asthma risk, and the presence of both is additive. Although the precise mechanisms responsible are still under investigation, laboratory observations have shed some light on possible explanations. 27, 28 First, the number of high-affinity receptors for IgE on the surface of antigen-presenting cells is directly proportional to circulating levels of IgE antibody. Second, increased numbers of these receptors is associated with a decreased IFN response following the exposure of these cells to viruses such as influenza and rhinovirus. Third, when these receptors are cross-linked as occurs in vivo following allergen exposure, the release of IFNs is reduced even further. Thus, the development of allergic sensitization could result in a decreased innate immune response to respiratory viruses that could generate greater degrees of airway inflammation and the potential for airway remodeling and loss of lung function over time. Indeed, the number and severity of virus-associated wheezing exacerbations in early childhood has been associated with reduced lung function during childhood. 29 These data clearly link early life wheezing illnesses (predominantly with RV) and aeroallergen sensitization and raise the question of whether early life RV wheezing illnesses cause asthma in childhood or do they identify a cohort of children predisposed to asthma. In addition, it could be asked whether allergic sensitization is causing asthma or, as listed above for RV, is identifying a group of children at risk for asthma. Regardless, the current findings extend our previous observations by demonstrating that these events are not only important in early childhood, but increase asthma risk at least until the onset of adolescence. If primary prevention for asthma is possible, treatments aimed at attenuating or abrogating specific IgE antibody production and viral illnesses appear to be prime targets.",
