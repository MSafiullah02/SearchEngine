I read with great interest the recent recommendations outlined by Deitz et al. for patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [1] . For patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2\u2212) metastatic breast cancer, it is recommended that use of targeted oral therapies be weighed against the risk of adverse events and that dose reductions can minimize treatment-related toxicities. This was followed by the statement \"dose reduction of palbociclib does not diminish efficacy.\"",

To provide additional information for health care professionals in their decision-making, I would like to point out that dose reduction of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib also does not diminish efficacy. An analysis of patients with advanced breast cancer in the phase III MONALEESA-2, -3, and -7 trials who received ribociclib as initial endocrine-based therapy for advanced breast cancer showed that median progression-free survival was comparable between patients who had no dose reduction vs patients with \u2265 1 dose reduction (MONALEESA-2: 27.7 months vs 25.3 months; MONALEESA-3: not estimable vs not estimable; MONALEESA-7: 23.8 months vs 27.5 months) [2] . It has also been reported separately that ribociclib demonstrated a significant overall survival benefit over endocrine therapy alone in phase III trials (MONALEESA-3 and -7; MONALEESA-2 overall survival data is immature at this time) [3] . In all three trials, the most frequent adverse event (all grades) for patients with no dose reduction and \u2265 1 dose reduction was neutropenia. The most common reason for dose reduction was an adverse event.",
