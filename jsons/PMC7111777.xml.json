The amide unit is one of the most important and widely occurring functional groups; it is present in many natural products and is a key feature of many important drugs. Among the more notable examples of amide-containing compounds, those found in conjunction with N-heterocycles exhibit diverse and marked pharmacological activities. In particular, the HIV-1 NNRTIs,1 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors,2 and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors stand out.3 It is not surprising therefore that there are numerous papers in which amide bond formation has been described.4 Despite the plethora of available routes, most are plagued with problems, in particular, low yields and difficult workups. As a result, a new and more facile route was sought.",

Another variant utilizes methylethylketone and CaCO3\n8 while other references describe condensation promoted by triethylamine in acetic acid.9 Examples of aniline acylation in acetate buffer10 and aqueous K2CO3\n11 are also known, while another approach proposes the synthesis of 2-chloroacetanilides in base-free conditions. In the latter case, the reaction takes place in nonpolar solvent12 or in a mixed solvent system.13 Although there are many options available, it is important to note that most of these methods suffer from numerous side reactions arising from either N-quaternization of the organic base or hydrolysis, which lead to low yields and tedious work-up procedures.",
