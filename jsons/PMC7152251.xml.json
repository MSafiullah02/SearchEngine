            "text": "Plague in humans is a severe febrile illness caused by the gram-negative bacillus, Yersinia pestis. Historically, it is synonymous with catastrophic epidemics. Y. pestis is maintained in nature as a zoonotic infection of rodents and their fleas in scattered foci in large areas of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is an incidental infection of humans and mammals other than rodents. Humans acquire infection most often by the bite of rodent fleas, occasionally by handling or ingesting infected animal tissues, or by inhaling contagious airborne particles. The vast majority of cases of human plague now occur in underserved Third World populations where sanitation is poor and persons live in close association with rodent reservoirs of infection. The principal clinical forms of plague are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic (lymphadenitic) plague accounts for 85% or more of primary plague cases. Septicemic and pneumonic plagues occur most often as secondary complications of bubonic plague, but may arise directly from primary infections. All forms of plague are curable if they are diagnosed and treated early. However, delays in treatment can rapidly lead to potentially fatal overwhelming infection and endotoxemia. Although plague has a high epidemic potential, preventive steps can be taken to reduce risks of exposure, and outbreaks can be readily halted using standard public health measures. Cases should be reported to health authorities immediately so that appropriate investigative and control measures can be implemented without delay. Reporting and control of the disease is mandated by national and international health regulations. Recently, concern has been raised over plague as a potential weapon of terrorism; Y. pestis has been classified as a Category A select agent subject to federal laws governing its management and transport. Medical and public health preparedness and response plans have been developed to counter the threat of its potential misuse.1,\n2\n",

In the Justinian pandemic (circa 542\u2013767 ad), it is thought that plague moved from upper Egypt to the Mediterranean and spread from there to Europe and Asia Minor, ultimately causing an estimated 40 million deaths. The second plague pandemic began in Central Asia early in the 14th century, caused epidemics in China and India, and moved along caravan routes to the Near and Middle East. Entering Messina by ship in 1347, plague swept swiftly through Europe and the British Isles, receiving the epithet \u201cBlack Death.\u201d Medieval plague killed a quarter or more of the affected populations at its height and was followed by successive epidemics in the European region over the next several centuries. The last global surge of plague, the third (modern) pandemic, arose in the latter half of the 19th century in Yunnan Province, China, struck Hong Kong in 1894, and spread from there by rat-infested steamships to port cities throughout the world, including several in the United States.3, 4, 5 Within 30 years of its appearance in Hong Kong, the third plague pandemic had resulted in 26 million human cases and more than 12 million deaths, most of them in India.3\n",

By 1908, plague was epizootic in ground squirrels in counties surrounding the city,5 and in subsequent years spread to wild rodent populations throughout California and other states in the western third of the country. The last outbreak of urban plague and of person-to-person pneumonic transmission in the United States occurred in a slum area of Los Angeles in 1924\u20131925.",

The organism is nonfastidious and is highly infective to laboratory rodents. Y. pestis grows slowly but well on a wide variety of common media (e.g., brain-heart infusion broth, sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar). Routine specimens can be safely handled under BSL-2 procedures, but manipulation of isolates requires BSL-3 measures to adequately protect laboratory workers.14 Growth occurs across a wide range of temperature (4\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C) and pH (5.0 to 9.6), but is optimal at 28\u00b0C and pH 7.4. Incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours on agar yields pinpoint, transparent colonies that are easily overlooked, especially if there is contamination of the culture by other bacteria. At 48 hours, colonies are typically gray, 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter, and have an irregular \u201chammered metal\u201d appearance when viewed under magnification. In broth, Y. pestis grows in flocculent clumps, typically attached to the sides of the tube in downwardly projecting stalactite forms that leave a clear broth. With polychromatic stains such as Wayson, Wright, or Giemsa, plague bacilli from clinical specimens demonstrate a characteristic bipolar appearance resembling closed safety pins (Fig. 42-1\n). Although Y. pestis is not truly encapsulated, it produces an envelope that contains the unique fraction 1 (F1) glycoprotein surface antigen.",

The smaller, domestic, roof or black rat (R. rattus) is considered the most dangerous plague host. Since ancient times, this adaptable and clever rodent has lived in intimate domestic association with humans in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Its migration to Europe allowed the rapid spread of plague there during the medieval period. Black rats live in homes, adjacent grain fields, granaries, stables and barns, warehouses, and other places where human activity provides them with ready shelter and food supplies. They travel easily with human cargo and baggage and have (with their complement of fleas) been the principal agents of noncontiguous (per saltum) spread of plague. In contrast, the Norway rat (R. norvegicus) was probably not an important host in the first two great pandemics and is thought to have first migrated from Asia to the Middle East and Europe as late as the 18th century, when it displaced the roof rat as the principal plague host in urban areas of Europe and elsewhere. R. norvegicus is larger and more aggressive than R. rattus; it is a burrowing rodent that lives around the foundations of buildings and frequents cellars, drains, sewers, alleyways, brush heaps, and refuse dumps. The quartet of R. rattus, R. norvegicus, Y. pestis, and the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, was responsible for the global spread of plague during the third (modern) pandemic. Densities of rats (measured by trapping success rates) and of fleas on rats (rat flea index) and Y. pestis infection rates of both are important surveillance measurements.7,\n9\n",

The 1994 outbreak of reported pneumonic plague in Surat, India, probably involved fewer than 100 cases.13 Small clusters of cases of pneumonic plague have more recently been reported from Ecuador, Madagascar, and northern India. Because respiratory spread of Y. pestis occurs by infective droplets, only persons with close respiratory exposure have a high risk of infection.

            "text": "Bubonic plague is the prototypic plague illness.3,\n36,\n37 The usual incubation period of bubonic plague is 2 to 6 days, occasionally longer. Illness typically begins with headache, fever of 38\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, and a feeling of weakness. At the same time, or within 24 hours, the patient notices tenderness and pain in one or more regional lymph nodes proximal to the site of inoculation of the plague bacillus. The femoral and inguinal groups of nodes are most commonly involved, followed by the axillary and cervical nodes. Upper body sites may be relatively more involved in children than adults. The enlarging bubo(es) becomes progressively swollen, painful, and tender, sometimes exquisitely so. Typically, the patient guards against palpation and limits movement, pressure, and stretching around the bubo. The surrounding tissue often becomes edematous, sometimes markedly, and the overlying skin may be erythematous, warm, tense, and may desquamate (Fig. 42-3\n). Inspection of the skin surrounding or distal to the bubo sometimes reveals the site of a flea bite marked by a small papule, pustule, scab, or ulcer. Larger pustular lesions (furuncles or carbuncles), ulcers, and eschars may rarely occur and can be confused with those caused by tularemia or anthrax. The bubo of plague is distinguishable from lymphadenitis of most other causes by its rapid onset, extreme tenderness, accompanying signs of toxemia, and usual absence of cellulitis or obvious ascending lymphangitis. Treated in the uncomplicated state with an appropriate antibiotic, bubonic plague usually responds quickly, with disappearance of fever and resolution of other systemic manifestations over 2 to 5 days. Buboes often remain enlarged and tender for a week or more after treatment has begun and can occasionally become fluctuant. Without effective antimicrobial treatment, bubonic plague may progress to an increasingly toxic state of fever, tachycardia, lethargy leading to prostration, agitation and confusion, and, occasionally, convulsions and delirium. Mild forms of bubonic plague, called pestis minor, have been described in South America and elsewhere; in these cases, the patients are ambulatory, only mildly febrile, and have subacute buboes.",

Further, patients with sepsis often present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, making a correct clinical diagnosis even more challenging.41 If not treated early with appropriate antibiotics and aggressive supportive care, septicemic plague is usually fulminating and fatal. In the United States from 1960 to 2004, 19 of 64 primary septicemic plague cases were fatal, yielding a case-fatality ratio of 30%. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) may progress rapidly. Petechiae and ecchymoses are manifestations of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In later stages, thrombi in the microvasculature of acral parts, such as tips of ears and digits, may result in gangrene of affected tissues.

Most cases were late complications of bubonic plague, and 14 patients (78%) survived. Although meningitis may be a part of the initial presentation of plague, its onset is often delayed and may be the result of insufficient antibiotic treatment of the primary illness.43 Chronic, relapsing meningeal plague over periods of weeks and even months was described in the preantibiotic era. Plague meningitis presents as a typical bacterial meningitis, with fever, headache, altered mental status, meningismus, and a polymorphonuclear leukocytic pleocytosis.",

The plague virulence protein YopM targets the innate immune response by causing a global depletion of natural killer (NK) cells, possibly by blocking expression of functional IL-15R on NK cells and inhibiting IL-15 expression by macrophages. IL-15 is crucial for the maintenance and activation of circulating NK cells as well as for their development in the bone marrow.51 YopM, after delivery to host cells through a type III secretion mechanism, is transported to the nucleus.51 Production of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells is necessary for early activation of macrophages to mediate robust bactericidal activity, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and strong expression of Th1 cytokines. The depletion of NK cells during Y. pestis infection results in an early decrease in production of Th1 cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1. The loss of IFN-\u03b3 expression in the Y. pestis\u2013infected host may contribute to the absence of granulomas.

Following conversion, serologic titers diminish gradually over months to years. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies to Y. pestis are useful in identifying antibodies in early infection and in differentiating them from antibodies developed in response to previous vaccination.

Because of its ready availability and ease of administration, gentamicin is replacing streptomycin as treatment for plague patients in the United States. Although comparative trials of safety and efficacy of streptomycin versus gentamicin in plague have not been conducted, case reports and a retrospective review of patients treated in New Mexico indicate that gentamicin is an acceptable substitute in the treatment of plague.58 Tetracycline and chloramphenicol are effective alternatives to the aminoglycosides. Doxycycline has become the tetracycline of choice because of its ease of administration, rapid and efficient absorption after ingestion, and its superior ability to achieve and maintain peak serum concentrations following oral administration. Chloramphenicol is indicated for conditions in which high tissue penetration is important, such as plague meningitis, pleuritis, endophthalmitis, and myocarditis. Chloramphenicol can be used separately or in combination with an aminoglycoside. Treatment with doxycycline, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol should begin with loading doses.",
