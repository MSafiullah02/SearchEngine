The determination of E k is a very difficult computational problem that serves to give answers on many problems such as the computation of the class number of k, the capitulation problem and many other problems in algebraic number theory. The most spectacular result that describes the structure of E k is the well known Dirichlet's unit theorem that says that",

For the particular family of multiquadratic number fields there are some useful algorithms by Wada (cf. [16] ) and Azizi (cf. [3] ) that helped to compute the unit groups of many families of real biquadratic number fields and imaginary triquadratic number fields (cf. [7, 4] ). Whereas these algorithms became very difficult to be applied for real multiquadratic fields of degree \u2265 8 and imaginary multiquadratic fields of degree \u2265 16. In the best of our knowledge there is only one example, in literature, that explicitly determines the unit groups of some infinite families of such fields (see the recently submitted paper [9] ). In \u00a72 of this paper we shall reinforce the algorithms of Wada and Azizi by a process of elimination based on norm maps and class number formulas to explicitly determine unit groups of the fields",

Remarks on the Hilbert 2-class field towers and the cyclotomic Z 2 -extensionsLet k be an algebraic number field and Cl 2 (k) the 2-Sylow subgroup of its ideal class group Cl(k). Let k (1) (resp. k (2) ) be the first (resp. second) Hilbert 2-class field of k and put G = Gal(k (2) /k), then if G \u2032 denotes the commutator subgroup of G, we have by class field theory G \u2032 \u2243 Gal(k (2) /k (1) ) and G/G \u2032 \u2243 Gal(k (1) /k) \u2243 Cl 2 (k). Assume in all what follows that Cl 2 (k) is of type (2, 2), then in [14] , Kisilevsky showed that G is isomorphic to Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z, Q m , D m or S m , where Q m , D m , and S m denote the quaternion, dihedral and semidihedral groups respectively, of order 2 m , where m \u2265 3 and m \u2265 4 for S m . Let F 1 , F 2 and F 3 be the three quadratic unramified of k such that F 1 is cyclic. Then using some known results of group theory one can easily deduce from [14, Theorem 2] that we have (cf. [9, Remark 2.2]) :Remark 3.1. The 2-class groups of the two fields F 2 and F 3 are cyclic if and only if k (1) = k (2) or k (1) = k (2) and G \u2243 Q 3 . In the other cases the 2-class groups F 2 and F 3 are of type (2, 2) (whereas that of F 1 is cyclic).Set the following notations:( Proof. Let k = Q( \u221a 2pq, i). By Remark 3.2, the 2-class group of k is of type (2, 2) . Note that L pq , F pq and K pq are the three unramified quadratic extension of k. Since by [8] the 2-class group L pq is cyclic, then the above preliminaries completes the proof.Since the 2-class group of L pq is cyclic, then the Hilbert 2-class field of L pq terminates at the first layer. Now we shall determine the structure of the groups Gal(F (2) pq /F pq ) and Gal(K If p and q verify conditions (2) , then we haveSince the 2-class group of L pq is cyclic (so its Hilbert 2-class field tower terminates at the first layer) and L 1,pq is an unramified extension of L pq , then the 2-class group of L 1,pq is also cyclic. As L 1,pq is also a quadratic unramified extension of both F pq and K pq , then by [9, Proposition 2.2] and Theorems 2.5 and 2.8 we have |Gal(F Remark 3.5. Put k = Q( \u221a 2pq, i) and assume that p and q are two primes verifying conditions (1) . The author of [2] did not determine the order of Gal(k (2) /k). Now it is easy to deduce that it is of order |Gal(k (2) /k)| = 2 m+1 (i.e, Gal(k (2) /k) \u2243 Q m+1 ), where m is such that h 2 (\u2212pq) = 2 m . Theorem 3.6. Let p and q be two primes satisfying conditions (1) or (2). Put \u03c0 1 = 2, \u03c0 2 = 2 + \u221a 2,..., \u03c0 n = 2 + \u221a \u03c0 n\u22121 , L n = Q( \u221a q, \u221a p, \u03b6 2 n+2 ) and L + n = Q( \u221a p, \u221a q, \u221a \u03c0 n ). Then 1. For all n \u2265 1, the 2-class group of L + n is trivial. By Theorems 2.5 and 2.8, the class number of Q( \u221a p, \u221a q, \u221a 2) the first step of the cyclotomic Z 2 -extension of k is odd. So we have the first item by [11, Theorem 1] .",
