For the past few months, there has been a substantial decrease in elective surgeries due to mobilization of hospital staff and equipment to the battle of the pandemic and needless to say fewer trauma cases due to the restricted movement of people amidst the lockdown. Due to the critical nature of the patients of neurosurgery urgent care has and shall always be dispatched worldwide due to its aggressive progression. Many centres still are practising their traits under strict measures of physical protection and quarantine measures. The dwindling supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a global issue as governments scramble to get their hands on this material's precious and in their proper dispense, there seems to be a greater discrepancy in sharing PPE with the surgical staff (2).",
