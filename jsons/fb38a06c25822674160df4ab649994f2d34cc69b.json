Innate immune responses can be mounted by virtually all nucleated cells in the body and are critical for anti-microbial defense [1, 2] . Besides being crucial in various non-immune cells, the innate responses are particularly developed in several key innate immune cells from myeloid origin (such as monocytes, macrophages (MF), dendritic cells (DC), mast cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils), and natural killer cells from lymphoid origin [1, 2] . The innate response is mounted very rapidly (within hours) and lasts for about four days until the adaptive response by T and B cells is engaged. This innate response is critical for initial survival and controlling infection until the slower but specific adaptive response has been mounted. Moreover, innate immune cells create a cytokine milieu which facilitates the activation of the adaptive response [3] . The innate immune compartment includes various biologically important sensors and effector components to detect and limit microbial infection, respectively [4] . The importance of these systems for microbial control is underpinned by the fact that almost all currently circulating pathogens have developed multiple strategies to circumvent these cellular recognition and innate immunity branches [5] .",

Based on their variable C-terminal domains, they have been classified into eleven different sub-groups (Fig. 1b) . In line with important functions in immune regulation, many TRIMs have been reported to be interferon (IFN)-inducible (Fig. 2) [26, 29] .

Functional studies have shown that TRIM5a can directly target components of retro-and lentiviral life cycles to confer antiviral effects by ubiquitin-dependent and -independent means [31] [32] [33] [34] , and may confer species-specific restriction. For example, while human TRIM5a restricts murine leukemia virus infection, it does not prevent HIV-1 infection [35] . In contrast, Old World monkey TRIM5a restricts infection with HIV-1, while being ineffective against infection with its simian counterpart SIV [36, 37] . In addition, to restriction of retroviruses, several other TRIMs have been reported to confer antiviral activity against members of most major virus families [38] . However, as recently discussed the biological relevance of some of these overexpression-based studies will need to be established in vivo [39] .",

Nevertheless, these ''TRIM-like'' proteins generally share their C-terminal domain layout with other members of their respective TRIM sub-group. Importantly, analysis of alternatively spliced TRIM mRNAs has indicated that for over a third of all TRIMs isoforms may be expressed lacking at least one of the RBCC domains. These data suggest that the pool of functional TRIM protein forms may be 2-3 times larger than the mere number of TRIM genes. Moreover, it indicates that the TRIM family is seemingly more defined by having at least a partial RBCC in combination with one of the eleven Cterminal domain constellations. Also functionally, various ''TRIMlike'' members have reported immune regulatory functions similar to their full-RBCC relatives (discussed below). For that reason, we use the TRIM designation for all family members.",

Both BBox types are zinc-finger structures highly similar to the RING domain, and the PHD domain found in the C-terminus of group VI TRIMs [40, 41] . Although mutations in TRIM BBoxes have been associated with auto-immune diseases in humans, very little is known about their structural and functional roles in cellular regulation. As a result of the high resemblance of BBoxes to RING domains, it has been suggested that BBoxes could in some TRIMs provide an E2 binding site similar to RINGs and thereby confer E3 ligase activity to RINGless TRIMs. In support of this notion, recent work demonstrated that RINGless TRIM16 confers ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in vitro [42] . In addition to this ubiquitin-dependent function, ubiquitin-independent functions have been described for TRIM BBoxes, such as for TRIM20 to keep the ASC inflammasome adaptor in an auto-inhibited state [43] , and for TRIM14 where it may fulfill an scaffolding role in MAVS-mediated signaling [44] .",

In fact, plotting of the TRIM gene numbers in species representing various stages of eukaryotic evolution suggests that the increases in TRIM genes shows several similarities with the rapid evolution of the IFN system (Fig. 3) . One example of these similarities is the expansion of the ancestors of the IFN regulatory factors (IRF) -which in vertebrates drive the transcription of IFNs. Although ancestral IRFs were already present in early invertebrates, their number rapidly expanded and evolved under heavy positive selection from a common ancestor to the jawed vertebrates similar to TRIMs (Fig. 3 ) [55] .",

So far there is little experimental evidence linking TRIM function to the adaptive immune system, although fifteen TRIMs are highly expressed in T and/or B cells (Fig. 4) . In fact, a subset of TRIMs has been previously shown to be highly expressed in CD4 T cells with immune-modulatory roles such as T h 2 and IL10-T reg cells as compared to MF and DCs [26] . Thus far, only a specific function has been described for TRIM27 in negative regulation of Ca 2+ influx and cytokine production during TCR engagement by targeting phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase C2b (PI3KC2b) for K48-mediated proteasomal degradation [62] , and TRIM28 which in CD4 T cells by yet unknown mechanisms regulates IL2 production and cell proliferation upon TCR engagement [63] .

However, despite a similar overall structure, still many differences exist between avian and mammalian immune system. A detailed comparison is hindered by relatively limited functional knowledge on the avian side, however, it is clear that several important differences between the avian and mammalian immune system exist. These differences may have functional significance; for example, studies have shown that avian strains of influenza viruses encode for non-structural-1 (NS1) proteins that are more efficient in binding and inhibiting TRIM25-mediated IFN induction in chickens than human influenza virus strains, suggesting species-specific adaptation [64] .",

This indicates that even differences exist in the TRIM repertoire of these primates and other higher mammals with highly similar immune systems, suggesting that these TRIMs are under specific selection pressures such as from specific pathogens, rather than being only immune regulators.

TRIM38 was shown to interact with TRAF6 through its PRY-SPRY domain, thereby negatively regulating TRAF6 function by facilitating TRAF6 K48 poly-ubiquitination and degradation [98] .

This indicates that TRIMs can also regulate the activity of other non-TRIM ubiquitin ligases in these signaling pathways.

Using these approaches combined with the deubiquitinating enzyme IsoT, which specifically degrades unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains by recognizing their exposed C-terminal motif, our work identified TRIM6 to activate IKKe by mediating the synthesis of unanchored K48-linked poly-Ub chains (Fig. 5b) . Although covalently attached K48 poly-Ub had been exclusively reported as mediators for proteasomal degradation, these data indicated that their unanchored variety could have the opposite function and mediate kinase multimerization and activation. In addition, this study also provided evidence that unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains are formed in vivo and play an important physiological activating role in antiviral immunity. The question whether these findings are unique to TRIM6 and IKKe or are in fact relevant in other cell biological systems is of great interest and will need further future study.",

On the one hand, Trim21 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were reported to develop systemic auto-immune symptoms upon ear puncture with a highly inflammatory T h 17 cytokine signature, which was reversed by crossing of these mice to an IL23/p19 deficient background [112] . On the other hand, other groups found that TRIM21 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice did not have any signs of auto-inflammatory disease, even upon ear puncture [113, 114] . While Trim21 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs derived from these mice did have an elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine signature, these responses were indistinguishable in wt and Trim21 \u00c0/\u00c0 bone marrow-derived DCs and MFs [114] . In line with this finding that perhaps TRIM21 only affects cytokine induction in certain cell types like fibroblasts, cytokine induction in the brains of adenovirus infected Trim21 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was similar to wt counterparts [75] . Although differences in animal housing and pathogen exposure could account for the phenotypic differences found in these studies, it has been suggested that the strategies used to make the knockout mice in these studies differed and some of the T h 17-axis inflammatory phenotype could be due to the synthesis of a truncated TRIM21 form lacking its C-terminal half [112, 113] .",

In their experiments, Trim20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice did not have any auto-inflammatory phenotype and were phenotypically normal, whereas knock-in mice carrying TRIM20 PRY-SPRY mutations found in human FMF patients developed spontaneous inflammatory disease, which cross-ins with Il1br \u00c0/\u00c0 or Asc \u00c0/\u00c0 mice revealed was completely ASC and IL1b dependent [118] .

However, what these studies also emphasize is that the manner in which different TRIMs regulate the immune response is complex. The same TRIMs may have different, multiple or even opposite functions in different signaling pathways and some functions may be speciesspecific and cell type-specific. Although some studies have focused on the biological relevance of individual TRIM proteins in these primary cell types, the majority of studies have been in cell lines and/ or non-immune cells. Hence, an important future effort will lay in addressing the relevance and molecular mechanism of these TRIMs in the regulation of immune signaling in primary cells and in vivo. The identification and study of biological relevance of individual TRIMs in the correct cell type is likely to be especially important considering the restricted expression of many (Fig. 4) . Even in mouse studies using different Trim21 knockout alleles, discrepancies in inflammatory phenotypes have been reported, which stresses the importance of generating mice with null mutations or carefully analyzing the expression of the protein expressed from the targeted gene using antibodies which could recognize truncated peptides expressed from exons not targeted in the mouse.",

Although many of the cancer-associated TRIMs have been shown to modulate specific cell cycle regulators, it is interesting to note that NFkB-mediated cell regulation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are two of the three central molecular systems involved in the formation and progression of cancer [126, 127] . Since TRIMs as immune regulatory E3 ligases have been heavily associated with both of these systems, it could be possible that for some cancer-associated TRIMs there is a link to their immune regulatory functions. Furthermore, it emphasizes that their physiological role may only be addressed by generating conditional knockout mice or selective gene targeting approaches to study their roles in vivo.",

This will require mapping in specific cells of all major TRIM interaction partners, combined with the identification of key residues essential for TRIM interaction with its binding partners, and the generation of mice where specifically the interaction with the immune molecule of interest is disrupted. Especially in combination with conditional/cell type-specific targeting, such an approach could be very powerful to delineate the biological role of TRIMs for the immune response in vivo with much more resolution and less interference from potentially affecting more than one role of a multi-functional protein.",

In combination with advanced live imaging techniques these approaches will enable studying the regulation in space and time of TRIM proteins under endogenous setting without the risk of artifacts arising from overexpression or the use of artificial cell types.",
