            "text": "Adequate molecular epidemiology databases of infectious agents are important for infection prevention and treatment programs. However, an adequate database of that type, particularly one that includes the respiratory viruses, is not available in Indonesia, a developing country located in Southeast Asia with a tropical climate and a large population (the fourth most populous country; http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/indonesia-glance/geography-indonesia). There is a lack of information concerning both the prevalence of respiratory virus infections and the viral genotypes circulating throughout Indonesia. The absence of this information is a barrier to the development of appropriate public health interventions, including immunization policies and health protection measures. Respiratory virus incidence and prevalence data throughout Indonesia are also very limited and have not been well documented. Only a few reports are available [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] that demonstrate the presence of influenza viruses in patient populations randomly selected from various studies. The presentation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been reported in children [7, 8, 9, 10] but not in adults. There is no information about the presentation of other respiratory viruses, including their seasonal epidemic patterns and their association with specific clinical findings. Prevalence information is also required to direct approaches for securing appropriate clinical services for infected patients. Moreover, there are few data about respiratory viral infections in adults with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia, because most studies have been performed in children. The prevalence, clinical profile, and epidemiology of respiratory viruses in adults are different from those in young people [11]. Additionally, the relationship between the geographical distribution, season, and respiratory virus species is not fully understood in adults. Consequently, there is a clear need to further study the prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults with ARI. Based on these conditions, a cross-sectional study of adults with influenza-like illness (ILI), ARI, or severe ARI (SARI) was performed at the Dr. Moewardi General Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia, to determine the prevalence of a select group of human respiratory viruses, including the influenza A virus, the influenza A H1 virus, the influenza A H3 virus, the influenza A H5 virus, the influenza B virus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV)-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, HPIV-4, RSV A, RSV B, human rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, HCoV-229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and adenovirus. This study aimed to describe the viral genotypes, evaluate the epidemic seasonality, and determine whether specific characteristics were associated with these infections. The clinical presentation and coinfection with torque teno virus (TTV) and human gyrovirus (HGyV) were also investigated.",

Patients with underlying diseases (HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, alcoholism, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, asplenia, leukopenia, cavitary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and sepsis) were excluded. Approval was obtained from the institutional ethical committee review boards of the Faculty of Medicine of Sebelas Maret University and the Dr. Moewardi General Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals participating in this study. Upper respiratory (nasal and throat swabs) specimens were collected from each participant after informed consent had been obtained. The collected specimens were placed into viral transport media (BD Universal Viral Transport, Sparks, Md., USA) and kept at 4\u00b0 during transportation. The clinical data were obtained from the patient medical records. All procedures were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.",

The nucleic acids were then aliquoted, and one aliquot was reverse-transcribed using a Superscript III First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix Kit with random hexamers (Invitrogen). All DNA and cDNA were used immediately for nested multiplex PCR for 19 respiratory viruses as described previously [14]. Briefly, each nested multiplex PCR assay detected several pathogens: group 1 contained influenza A- and B-specific primers and subtype H1N1-, H3N2-, and H5N1-specific primers; group 2 contained primers for the parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4a, and PIV-4b); group 3 contained primers for RSV A, RSV B, HRV, and EV; group 4 contained primers for HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, and HMPV, and group 5 contained primers for HBoV, adenovirus 1, adenovirus 2, adenovirus 3, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Molecular detection was performed by PCR using a AmpliTaq Gold\u00ae 360 DNA Polymerase Kit (Invitrogen). Internal amplification controls were included in each molecular assay to exclude false-negative results. The corresponding positive controls and one negative control (sterile water) sample were included for each group simultaneously. To prevent PCR contamination, the reagent preparation, sample processing, and nested PCR assays were performed in rooms separate from where the amplified products were analyzed. Aerosol-resistant pipette tips were used throughout the assays. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet illumination. All samples were tested at least twice.",

Surakarta is centrally located at the strategic paths connecting Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surabaya, which is why Surakarta became an important business center for the surrounding district (http://www.surakarta.go.id/). Surakarta has 12 general hospitals; however, only the Dr. Moewardi General Hospital acts as a government-operated tertiary hospital in Surakarta.",

In the present study, HRV was detected most frequently, followed by the influenza A H3 virus, HMPV, the influenza B virus, adenovirus, HCoV-OC43, and HPIV-3. Our samples were mostly derived from patients with ARI, suggesting that adults with ARI caused by a respiratory virus may be more likely to be hospitalized [23, 24].",

Based on our molecular analysis and comparisons with sequences from the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases, the nucleotide sequences of all influenza A H3N2 isolates in our study shared a higher homology with foreign strains than with any influenza A H3N2 virus isolated previously in Indonesia.

In the present study, the detection of TTV was associated with ARI and hospitalization and, intriguingly, all TTV-positive ARI patients were hospitalized. Single infections with TTV were not detected in nasal and throat samples from patients with exacerbations of asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis. In addition, single infections with TTV were not detected in nasal and throat samples from patients with pneumonia. However, 8 pneumonia samples were positive for coinfection with TTV and a respiratory virus.

Moreover, prior to this study, there were only limited data about the molecular epidemiology profiles of respiratory viruses in Indonesia, and none of the data were derived from adult patients with ARI. HMPV, HRV, adenovirus, HCoV-OC43, and HPIV-3 were also detected for the first time in Indonesia. However, our study had several limitations. We only tested for specific acute upper respiratory infection etiologies, including common human respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria; this limitation reflects a limited budget for etiological diagnosis, which is a common situation in hospitals in developing countries. The data collection was also limited to one tertiary hospital over a 1-year period due to the limited budget; therefore, the seasonal patterns for the viruses were derived from one season, and the number of study patients may have been insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Additional surveillance studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to confirm and extend our findings.",
