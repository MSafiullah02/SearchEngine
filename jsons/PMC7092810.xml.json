These proteins were selected as queries for searching the protein\u2013protein interaction database DIP (http://www.DIP.org). (2) Proteins in the DIP database that possibly interact with SARS_NP homologous proteins were selected as the candidates of the SARS_NP binding proteins. (3) PFAM database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) was searched to obtain the domain distributions of the binding protein candidates. (4) Keywords search was performed on the PFAM and Interpro databases (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) to annotate the biological functions of the SARS_NP binding protein candidates. Proteins with functions related to immunosuppression, immunoregulation, and virus infection were picked out for further analysis and biological assay.",

These complex models were solvated by a 28 \u00c5 TIP3P [35] water sphere. Then the solvated models were equilibrated for 300 ps at 300 K by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and a 100 ps MD simulation was run on each model system, sampling the conformations for binding free energy calculation. All MD simulations were carried out by using the AMBER 7.0 program with AMBER force field (parm98) [33]. The MM/PBSA method [36] was used to evaluate the binding free energies of SARS_NP\u2013hCypA complexes. In general, the average binding free energy of protein\u2013protein interaction (averaged over 50 samples isolated from the MD trajectory), \u0394G\nbind, is calculated by Eq. (3):(3)\u0394Gbind=Gcomplex-Gprotein1-Gprotein2=\u0394EMM+\u0394GPB+\u0394GNP,where \u0394E\nMM is the interaction energy of the two proteins calculated by the AMBER force field, including internal, electrostatic, and van der Waals components; \u0394G\nPB is the polar solvation contribution calculated by using a finite-difference Poisson\u2013Boltzmann (PB) model [37], and \u0394G\nNP is the non-polar solvation energy, which is obtained from the solvent accessible surface area (SASA). The relative binding free energy, \u0394\u0394G\nbind, is the difference between the binding free energy of a mutated SARS_NP (or hCypA) to wild-type hCypA (or SARS_NP) and that of wild-type SARS_NP to wild-type hCypA.",

In separate experiments, the dissociation constant (K\nD) of SARS_NP from hCypA immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip and the dissociation constant (KD\u2032) of hCypA from immobilized SARS_NP were determined. The binding responses in resonance units (RUs) were continuously recorded and presented graphically as a function of time. The association could be described by a simple equilibrium of the A + B \u21d4 AB type (A, analyte; B, ligand; and AB, complex). To determine the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction, the equilibrium response (R\neq) data were fit to an independent binding-site model,(4)Req=\u2211iRmax,i\u00d7C\u00d7KA,i1+C\u00d7KA,i,where R\nmax stands for the maximal response, C is the concentration of injection sample, and K\nA is the association constant. For a single-site interaction, i\n = 1, for two\u2013site binding, i\n = 2, and so on. The results are shown in Fig. 1\nand listed in Table 1\n. For the first determination (with hCypA immobilized on the chip), the rate association constant (k\non) was 1.17 \u00d7 104\n M\u22121\n s\u22121, the rate dissociation constant (k\noff) was 7.10 \u00d7 10\u22125\n s\u22121, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD) was estimated (k\noff/k\non) as 6.04 \u00d7 10\u22129\n M. For the second determination (with SARS_NP immobilized on the chip), the rate association constant (kon\u2032) and the rate dissociation constant (koff\u2032) between the two proteins were 854 M\u22121\n s\u22121 and 1.36 \u00d7 10\u22124\n s\u22121, respectively, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD\u2032) was 1.59 \u00d7 10\u22127\n M. This indicates that SARS_NP binds hCypA with a high affinity, much higher than the binding affinity between HIV-1 CA and hCypA, \u223c16 \u03bcM [40]. Furthermore, the sensorgrams (Fig. 1) and the k\non and k\noff values (Table 1) revealed that both the association and dissociation between SARS_NP (or hCypA) and hCypA (or SARS_NP) are slow processes.",

            "text": "Encouraged by the experimental verification of the binding between SARS_NP and hCypA with high affinity, we made an attempt to identify the responsible binding sites on both proteins. This was achieved by constructing a three-dimensional (3D) model for the SARS_NP\u2013hCypA complex. At present, the X-ray crystal structure of the complex between human cyclophilin A (hCypA) and the N-terminal domain (residues 1\u2013151) of HIV-1 capsid protein (CA151) is one of the experimental structures for hCypA in complex with another protein [29], [41]. Sequence alignment suggested that the segment Val235-Pro369 of SARS_NP is homologous to HIV-1 CA (Fig. 2A\n), with an identity of 25.1% and a similarity of 36.7%. Accordingly, we deduced that the binding site of SARS_NP to hCypA is located within this segment. We constructed a 3D model for the SARS_NP\u2013hCypA complex by taking the crystal structure of the hCypA\u2013CA151 complex [29] (PDB entry 1AK4) as a template. First, a 3D model of the segment Val235-Pro369 of SARS_NP was generated by homology modeling based on the 3D structure of HIV-1 CA151 in complex with hCypA\u2013CA [29]. Further domain analysis indicated that the SARS_NP segment Val235-Pro369 is a special domain, which belongs to the SCP (sterol carrier protein) protein family. The modeled 3D structure of SARS_NP segment Val235-Pro369 was docked manually into the active site of hCypA, allowing loop Trp302-Pro310 of NP, which aligns well with HIV-CA Pro85-Pro93, to lie in the active-site groove of hCypA in an extended conformation. The overall structural model of the SARS_NP(235\u2013369)\u2013hCypA complex is shown in Fig. 2B.",

Briefly, two hydrogen bonds form between the side-chain of hCypA Arg55 (N\u03b71 and N) and SARS_NP Gln307 (O\u03b51 and O); the N atom of hCypA Gln63 hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl O atom of SARS_NP Ile305; the N\u03b51 atom of hCypA Trp121 forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of SARS_NP Phe308; and the carbonyl oxygens of Gly72 and Asn102 of hCypA accept hydrogen bonds from the main-chain amides of SARS_NP Ile305 and Ala306, respectively (Fig. 3).

The mutation Trp302Ala abolishes the cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction between the indole ring of the tryptophane and the side-chain of hCypA Arg69 (Fig. 3). The SARS_NP\u2013hCypA binding model predicts a contact between the side-chain of Ile305 and hCypA Asn102. Indeed, replacement of Ile305 by Ala decreases the binding affinity by 1.81 kcal/mol (Table 1). This is also in agreement with the computational value of 0.55 kcal/mol. Mutation of Gln307 to Ala abolishes the hydrogen bond formed between this residue and hCypA Arg55 (N\u03b71) and also the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 hydrogen bond with hCypA Phe113 (Fig. 3), thereby reducing the hCypA binding affinity by about 0.44 kcal/mol. A decrease of the latter, albeit of larger magnitude (3.95 kcal/mol), had also been predicted by the theoretical calculations. To confirm the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 hydrogen bond, we performed a mutation of Gln307 to Asp. The negatively charged side-chain of Asp creates a repulsive interaction with the \u03c0 electrons of the benzene ring of hCypA Phe133, thus decreasing the hCypA binding affinity by about 0.71 kcal/mol.",

Mutation of Arg55 to Ala disrupts the two hydrogen bonds formed by the side-chain with the carbonyl O and side-chain O\u03b51 atoms of Gln307 (Fig. 3), respectively, which reduces the binding affinity (as determined by SPR) by about 0.90 kcal/mol. Mutation of Gln63 to Ala abolishes the hydrogen bond between its side-chain and the carbonyl O atom of Ile305, thus decreasing the SARS_NP binding affinity by about 3.23 kcal/mol. Trp121 contributes to SARS_NP binding by forming an intermolecular hydrogen bond between its indole NH and SARS_NP Phe308 O atom. Mutation of this tryptophane to Phe decreases the SARS_NP binding affinity by 3.03 kcal/mol. Additionally, mutation of Arg69 to Lys was also performed, which decreases the SARS_NP binding affinity by 1.77 kcal/mol. This result indicated again that a cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction exists between hCypA Arg69 and SARS_NP Trp302 (Fig. 3). For the above mutations, the free energy changes for SARS_NP binding to hCypA mutant proteins, relative to SARS_NP binding to wild-type hCypA, were also calculated by using the computational method, and all of these were found to be well in agreement with the experimental results (Table 1).",

Molecular dynamics simulations (unpublished result) indicated that there are many water molecules in the SARS_NP\u2013hCypA interface due to the attraction of the cationic side-chain of Arg69. Substitution of Arg69 by Ala tends to prevent water molecules from entering the protein\u2013protein interface due to the hydrophobicity of Ala and Trp302, which is beneficial to the SARS_NP\u2013hCypA binding.",
