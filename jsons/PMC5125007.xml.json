Quantitation of bacterial genomic (GroEL) DNA ranged from 1,200\u20131400 genomes per cm3 (tissue) based on single gene copy detection per bacterium in both MS and nonMS white matter (Fig. 1C). Bacterial rRNA sequence analyses of cloned amplicons derived from nonMS white matter displayed greater molecular diversity within multiple clones per sample compared to MS white matter (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1C). Phylogenetic assessment of bacterial sequences encoding the ribosomal 16s rRNA V3\u2013V5 domain cloned from a subset of samples was performed, which revealed alignment of brain-derived bacterial sequences from MS (n = 8) and nonMS (n = 6) patients with diverse bacterial species\u2019 sequences (Fig. 1A). Proteobacteria represented the most abundant phylum in both clinical groups although more cloned bacterial sequences were obtained from MS samples. These findings highlighted the preponderance of bacterial sequences resembling Proteobacterial species in brains with reduced bacterial genomic molecular diversity in MS patients\u2019 white matter.",

Greater than 60% of bacterial sequences were identified as unambiguously complementary to Proteobacteria sequences. While Actinobacteria was the second most abundant phylum in all cases, there was an enrichment of this phylum in RR-MS (p < 0.001) relative to nonMS white matter with a marked reduction of Actinobacteria sequence proportions in P-MS brains (Fig. 2A). Sequences matching bacteriophages with Proteobacteria hosts predominated in both clinical groups but were overrepresented in nonMS samples (Fig. 2B). The apparent contraction of bacterial molecular diversity within P-MS brains was associated with increased expression of immune genes in P-MS white matter (e.g., CD3\u03b5, HLA-DRA, IL-10, CD11c) (Fig. 2C). Proteobacteria sequence abundance was also examined in relation to host gene expression from the same sequencing analyses revealing a positive correlation with multiple groups of genes including NFKB-signaling, secondary metabolism, and energy metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Conversely, expression of genes related to nervous system regulation, gene silencing, and cell proliferation were negatively correlated with Proteobacteria RNA tag abundance (Supplementary Fig. 1B). These observations highlighted the predominance of Protobacteria-encoded RNA sequences in brains from MS and nonMS patients but also displayed variation in bacterial molecular diversity in relation to host immune responses.",

From brains of MS (n = 12) and nonMS (n = 6) patients, serial brain sections were investigated based on the presence of lesions on MRI that showed gadolinium-enhancement (T1) (Fig. 3A1) and/or evident on T2 images (Fig. 3A2). Strong LFB staining, indicative of intact myelin, was evident in nonMS white matter (Fig. 3B1) but was reduced in demyelinating MS lesions (Fig. 3B2). CD3\u03b5-immunolabeled T cells were occasionally detected in nonMS tissue sections (Supplementary Fig. 2a1) but CD3\u03b5-immunopositive cells were evident in MS lesions (Supplementary Fig. 2a2). CD68-immunopositive brain macrophages were minimally detected in nonMS white matter (Supplementary Fig. 2b1) but were abundant in demyelinating MS lesions (Supplementary Fig. 2b2). Bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) immunostaining was particulate, detected in sections from nonMS (Fig. 3c1) and MS (Fig. 3c2) brains but appeared to be more concentrated in MS lesions. This was in contrast to the lack of immunostaining apparent with the isotype control (Supplementary Fig. 2c). PGN immunodetection was co-localized with immunoreactivity to the astrocytic protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP in both MS and nonMS cases (Fig. 3c1 inset, Fig. 3e1, Supplementary Fig. 3b1,b2) and the microglial protein, Iba-1 (inset Fig. 3c2, Supplementary Fig 3a1,a2, respectively) with approximately 50% of each cell type associated with PGN immunopositive structures (Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). Bacterial RNA polymerase beta subunit immunoreactivity was also evident in both nonMS (Fig. 3d1) and MS (Fig. 3d2) brains together with in situ hybridization detection of bacterial 16s rDNA (insets in Fig. 3d1). To verify these findings, neuropathological features were scored by a neuropathologist (JQL), unaware of the slide identity, in the same brain sections from MS and nonMS which showed significantly increased CD3\u03b5 and CD68 immunodetection with reduced LFB staining in MS sections compared to nonMS brains. Concurrent semi-quantitative scoring of PGN immunoreactivity within each entire tissue section did not differ between clinical groups (Supplementary Table 2). These findings implied that in nonMS and MS brain tissues, bacterial genomes and proteins were detectable, recapitulating and extending earlier studies of bacterial detection in human brains with and without neurological disease. Despite obvious neuropathological differences, total PGN abundance per brain section was similar in MS and nonMS brains suggesting that overall bacterial burden did not distinguish MS from nonMS patients.",

Application of a second anti-PGN monoclonal antibody showed PGN immunolabelling in nonMS (Fig. 4A) and MS (Fig. 4B) brain sections with increased PGN immunoreactivity that was most evident in areas of reduced LFB staining in MS patients. Co-quantitation of myelination and bacterial quantity within each section revealed LFB staining was not correlated with the density of PGN immunolabelling in nonMS brain sections (Fig. 4A) (r = \u22120.09). In contrast PGN abundance was correlated with decreased LFB staining intensity within MS lesions (Fig. 4B) (r = \u22120.319). Because of the inverse correlation between LFB intensity and PGN immunolabelling, we examined host gene expression in adjacent serial tissue sections by Nanostring transcript array in sections from each tissue block which disclosed induction of immune genes, NFKB1, RIPK1 and IL-12A, in MS brains and showed the highest correlations with PGN expression. Pathway analyses using these transcript array findings in association with PGN expression revealed an integrated network (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis score = 17) implicating other genes associated with MS pathogenesis (e.g., MHC Class II, ERK1/2, and immunoglobulin) as molecular hubs (Fig. 4C). Principal component analysis (PCA) including linked PGN and transcript (NFKB1, RIPK1 and IL-12A) expression as first (69% of variance) and second components (17% of variance) revealed clustering of nonMS white matter samples (Fig. 4D) while MS samples were scattered, reflecting the heterogeneity of disease severity. These observations indicated that a key bacterial component (PGN) was concentrated within demyelinating MS lesions in association with innate immune gene activation.",

Proteobacteria represented the chief bacterial phylum detected in human brain with restricted molecular diversity in MS brains despite the increased density of bacterial glycoproteins within demyelinating lesions. Evidence for bacterial presence in human brains was verified by using several monoclonal antibodies that recognized specific bacterial proteins, in situ hybridization, PCR amplification and cloning of bacterial RNA and DNA sequences together with massively parallel sequencing of brain-derived RNA. The presence and type of bacteria in brain was associated with host immune gene expression, which were apparent using different methods. These findings indicated a strong interaction between bacterial presence and host responses involving NF\u03baB-related signaling in demyelinating lesions, which is a pivotal pathway in neuroinflammation and MS pathogenesis26.",

            "text": "As contamination of tissue specimens and experimental tools was a paramount concern in the present study, extensive precautions were implemented to mitigate this concern, given the relative low levels of bacterial burden observed in the present studies. Phylogenetic analyses of PCR-derived sequences displayed similarities to Propionibacterium, a common cutaneous and nasopharyngeal bacterium in a single MS patient which might reflect contamination during the autopsy process or alternatively in vivo transport from the nasopharynx via the cribriform plate, as reported for other bacteria27. However, the correlations between peptidoglycan abundance and host neuroimmune responses, using both Nanostring and deep sequencing, argues against contamination, particularly the consistent preponderance of NF\u03baB-associated transcriptional observations (Figs 2 and 4, Supplementary Fig. 1A). Moreover, the presence of viruses in the brain inducing local immune responses was unlikely here because of the relative paucity of detectable viral genomes (Supplementary Table 3). Reduced molecular diversity among MS brain-derived 16s V3-V5 rRNA sequences as well as the increased density of PGN immunoreactivity associated with demyelination are also at odds with contamination as the sole explanation for the present observations. The present studies revealed the ratio of bacterium-encoded 16s rDNA to rRNA in matched brain samples to be ~1:2 in both white matter (and cortex, data not shown) with bacterial numbers of 1200\u20131400 genomes/cm3 suggesting both bacterial burden and replication were low compared to active pathogenic infections in other tissues. The low bacterial rDNA:rRNA ratio and burden are not surprising given the sensitivity of the brain to bacterial molecules (e.g., endotoxin), which at high levels can lead to adverse effects on brain tissue. The reduced molecular diversity of bacterial RNA sequences in MS brains implies an overgrowth in select bacteria, perhaps Proteobacteria, as indicated by the current sequencing data (Fig. 2) from progressive MS patients, which was diversified in relapsing-remitting MS patients receiving disease modifying therapies. These results recapitulate changes in microbial populations in other diseased organs and are reminiscent of a dysbiosis that can be resolved by increasing microbial diversity. The differential distribution of individual bacterial phyla consistently associated with clinical phenotype and immune activation, observed across multiple lots of reagents, collectively support the specificity of the current findings.",

            "text": "The detection of bacterial DNA and RNA sequences, proteins and cell wall components in human brains raises the question of how bacteria might enter the brain. The bacterial sequences detected in the present studies of human brain resemble those of environmental (soil-derived) bacteria28, largely without human disease associations. Phagocytes including macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells can engulf live microbes or microbial compounds at different mucosal sites29. Polymicrobial species have been detected in human blood, particularly in leucocytes including neutrophils and macrophages30. In rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, leukocytes enter the brain following activation in the lung31, suggesting that lung epithelium also provides an interface for microbial translocation. Given that the present bacterial species\u2019 sequences are similar to environmental bacteria, inhalation and phagocytosis with ensuing trafficking to the brain is a plausible route of CNS entry. The presence of bacteria or their components (e.g., PGN), even in a quiescent state and in low copy numbers in the brain, could exert effects on neurocognitive functions, inflammatory gene expression, and perhaps on neural cell (e.g., oligodendrocyte) survival. Potential consequences of resident bacteria in brain include altered myelin viability and repair as well as activation of host inflammatory genes with pathogenic or protective effects32. These effects could be consequences of colonization by viable bacteria or the presence of bacterial PAMPs from non-viable bacteria. Our previous study23 in which we successfully transmitted human brain-derived bacteria to immunocompromised mice suggests that some of these organisms are viable as the persistence of residual RNA is not sufficient to explain the finding given the duration of those studies. Identifying the individual bacterial species and their impact on inflammatory demyelination might yield insights into MS prevention and treatment. Indeed, recent studies of minocycline treatment of MS (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00666887) could also be interpreted within the context of the current study. Similarly the putative neurotoxic effects of antibiotics might be related to their actions on microbiota located in the brain (or gut) with potential adverse consequences for gut-brain interactions3334. Further delineation of the individual bacterial species in brain and other organs that contribute to neurological disease (or health) are warranted because they might offer new therapeutic approaches or targets for inflammatory degenerative neurological diseases.",
