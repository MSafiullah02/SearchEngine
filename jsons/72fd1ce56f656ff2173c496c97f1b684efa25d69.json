In this research, we study the epidemic patterns of this virus from a mathematical modelling perspective. We implement an SEIR model, consisting of a set of first-order temporal differential equations (ODE's) to analyze the time evolution of the disease caused by the virus. The model is applied to the city of Buenos Aires and neighbouring cities (RMBA) with approximately 15 million inhabitants. The parameters of the model are calibrated by using as data the number of casualties officially reported. Since there are infinite solutions honouring the data, we show a set of cases by considering different situations. The first set of parameters yields initially a reproduction ratio R 0 = 3.30 decreasing to 0.92 in April 8, after the lockdown, but increasing to 2.44 after April 27, most probably due to an increase of the contagion in highly populated slums. This case has incubation and infectious periods of 11 and 7 days, approximately, and about 13 million people infected at the end of the epidemic. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 1.88 % and the predicted number of casualties is approximately 249000 deaths at the end of the",

However, this death toll is highly affected by the evolution of the reproduction ratio, and keeping R 0 = 0.92 after April 27, would cause 1321 casualties and only 66000 infected individuals. Other cases, assuming the present trend, predict smaller incubation periods (between 4 and 5 days) and yield between 30000 and 90000 deaths and IFRs between 0.5 % and 1 %. This means that the intensity of the lockdown (and behaviour of the population) is essential and that the measures have to be guided by precise model predictions. We also consider doubling the number of casualties to date and, in this case, the death toll is almost 44000 individuals and about 5.1 million people being infected. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit of the data, indicating the uncertainty of the results, which may differ from recent reported values of the incubation and infectious periods and fatality rate. The presented analysis allows us to study how isolation and social distancing measures affect the time evolution of the epidemic.",

Most of the mathematical models to simulate an epidemic divide the population into classes and assumptions about the time rate of transfer from one class to another (Hethcote, 2000; Brauer, 2017) . We refer to Hethcote (2000) , Keeling and Rohani (2008) and Diekmann et al. (2013) for detailed mathematical analyses of this kind of models. Here, we use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model consisting of a first-order in time system of ODE's, to describe the spread of the virus, compute the number of infected individuals, including the IFR to model the death toll. It is important to clarify that the E class is infected but has not the symptoms of the disease, because they are incubating it. They will have symptoms when they pass to class I. Individuals in class I may not have symptoms (asymptomatic), but they are infectious, while those in class E are not. Moreover, individuals in class E can move to R without showing symptoms, but they are infectious when they are in class I.",

The model is calibrated using the number of dead individuals to date, which we consider more reliable than the number of infectious individuals to predict the behaviour of the epidemic. The experience in China, European Union and USA shows that combining isolation measures and rapid diagnosis has a strong impact on the dynamics of the epidemic. Thus, it is important to analyze and quantify the effectiveness of these isolation measures (e.g., Chowell et al., 2003) .",

Furthermore, when more individuals are initially exposed (E(0)), the intensity of the peak does not change, but anticipates the epidemic. Other results indicate that if R 0 does not change during the epidemic, the peak of infected people is hardly sensitive to the initial number of infected individuals, and an earlier lockdown highly reduces the number of dead individuals. Table 1 shows the constraints, initial values and results for different cases, which honour the data. All the cases assume an initial number of infectious individual I(0) = 100, although this value may also affect the result.

The results are very sensitive to variations of the parameter \u03b2, and consequently those of R 0 , mostly due to the impact of the performed intervention strategies. The tragic situation predicted by the model is strongly influenced by the behaviour of R 0 during the latter period, after day 50. Therefore, a reduction of R 0 is essential to avoid this situation. intensive care, a more tractable amount.

This modelling can be performed by using fractional derivatives computed with the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov approximation, which is a generalization of the finitedifference derivative (Carcione et al., 2002; Carcione, 2014) or solving the differential equations in the frequency domain (Gauzellino, et al., 2014; Santos and Gauzellino, 2017) . Furthermore, the model can be made two-dimensional by including the spatial diffusion of the virus (e.g., Naheed et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2014) to model local outbreaks and be able to isolate them. The approach can be based on a finite-element method in the space-frequency domain with domain decomposition. This numerical procedure has already been applied to wave propagation in 2D and 3D media in geophysics (e.g., Santos and Gauzellino, 2017) . Alternatively, the Fourier pseudospectral method, to compute the spatial derivatives, combined with time-domain fractional derivatives, can be used to solve the space-time diffusion equation of the epidemic (Carcione et al., 2013; Carcione, 2014) . Moreover, there are more complex versions of the SEIR model as, for instance, including a quarantine class and a class of isolated (hospitalized) members (Brauer, 2017) .",

The reported infected people cannot be used for calibration, since at present the number of asymptomatic, undiagnosed infectious individuals is unknown. The number of death individuals is also uncertain, since there can be an under-ascertainment of deaths, but the error is much smaller than the error related to the infected individuals. The number of dead individuals reported officially could possibly be underestimated due to undeclared cases. Thus, we also consider a case with 100 % more dead people, compared to the official figures.Predictions of high accuracy are not possibly due to the lack of information about the probability of the disease transmission, characteristics of the disease and initial conditions of the SEIR model. We assume \u00b5 \u22121 = 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 / day, corresponding to a life expectancy of 76 years. Parameter \u03b2 varies as a piecewise constant function in time intervals [t 0 , t 1 ], [t 1 , t 2 ] . . . [t L\u22121 , \u221e], with changes associated with administrative measures (such as lockdown) taken by the state and behavior of the population. In this case, t 0 = 1 day, t 1 = 31 day and t 2 = 50 day, i.e., L = 3, since after t 1 (April 8), home isolation, social distancing and partial Nation lockdown started to be effective, as indicated by an inflection point in the curve of casualties, and after t 2 (April 27), the situation became worst with an increase in the slope of the curve.Fitting the causalities with the model parameters is an inverse problem with infinite solutions. In order to accomplish the fit, we use a simulated annealing algorithm developed byGoffe et al. (1994). The Fortran code can be found in: https://econwpa.ub. uni-muenchen.de/econ-wp/prog/papers/9406/9406001.txt. The fit is based on the L 2 -norm and yields \u03b1, \u03b2, , E(0) and \u03b3 on each time interval from the beginning of the epidemic (day 1, March 9, 2020) to date (day 61, May 8). For each fit, the parameters \u03b1, , E(0) and \u03b3 remain constant on the whole simulation time, while \u03b2 varies in the intervals [t 0 , t 1 ], [t 1 , t 2 ] and [t 2 , \u221e], as mentioned above.",

This case, which is characterized by a long incubation period of approximately 11 days, predicts an IFR = 1.88 % and a very high death toll (nearly 250 K) and 13 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. However, this is due to the last R 0 trend that can be inverted by implementing more isolation. In fact, maintaining the value of R 0 = 0.92 after April 27 yields only 1321 casualties.In the situation shown in Case 1, the maximum number of infected individuals is approximately 1.2 M people at day 180. If only 1 % of this individuals requires intensive care, this amount to 12000 humans, a number that can overload the capacity of the hospitals. The other cases honour the data with smaller incubation periods between 4 and 5 days, and predict less than 1/3 of casualties, compared to Case 1, with IFR between 0.5 % and 1 % approximately. For instance, Case 4 (Figure 3) has a peak of infected individuals equal to 200000, which implies 2000 patients if 1 % requires",
