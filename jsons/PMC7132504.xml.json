            "text": "The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic affected over 30 countries,1 mainly in Asia and Northern America, and involved more than 8000 probable cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide.2 New cases were reported in 2004.3 Several hospital outbreaks occurred, affecting both patients and healthcare workers.4, 5 It has been suggested that healthcare workers who are exposed to SARS patients can be infected with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), regardless of the intensity of exposure.6 This has alerted the global infection control community. Management of infected patients consisted of isolation and strict respiratory and contact precautions.7 A case-control study among 241 non-infected and 13 infected staff members with documented exposure to 11 index SARS patients suggested that wearing a face mask is the most important infection control tool, followed by appropriate hand hygiene,8 suggesting that droplets and hands play a major role in transmission of SARS-CoV. Hands may be contaminated by patient excretions or contact with contaminated surfaces. From the inanimate environment, nosocomial pathogens can be transmitted to hands quite easily.9 SARS-CoV has been described to persist on surfaces for up to 96 h.10 In another study, dried SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for as long as six days, indicating a relatively strong survival ability. Only after nine days in a dried state did SARS-CoV completely lose its infectivity.11 Results of a cohort study among visitors of a hotel suggested that environmental contamination should be considered as a possible source of infection.12 The Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany has recommended the use of disinfectants that have complete virucidal activity including the spectrum of non-enveloped viruses.13 The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that standard disinfectants should be effective against SARS-CoV,14 but experimental evidence is not available to date. This is why we have investigated the activity of various disinfectants against SARS-CoV.",

All alcohol-based hand rubs were tested without dilution. Three products were surface disinfectants: Mikrobac forte, based on benzalkonium chloride and laurylamine; Korsolin FF, based on benzalkonium chloride, glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride; and Dismozon pur, based on magnesium monoperphthalate. The surface disinfectants were tested at the recommended concentration for the recommended application time at which they have been shown to have bactericidal and yeasticidal activity, as well as sufficient efficacy in tests under practical conditions.15 The instrument disinfectant Korsolex basic, based on glutaraldehyde and (ethylenedioxy)dimethanol, was included due to the possible transmission of SARS-CoV by flexible bronchoscopes. The product was tested at the recommended concentration and application time that has been shown to have bactericidal and yeasticidal activity, as well as sufficient efficacy in tests under practical conditions.15\n",

SARS-CoV were grown in Vero cell cultures (African green monkey kidney, ATCC no. CCL-81). The maintenance medium consisted of minimum essential medium (MEM) without fetal calf serum (FCS) and containing 100 IU/mL of penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL of streptomycin. Virus stock was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Infectious virus titres were calculated as described by K\u00e4rber17 and Spearman,18 and determined as 50% tissue culture infective doses. Different virus stocks were used for the experiments. The initial log10 virus titres were between 8.93\u00b10.25 and 9.30\u00b10.38. In accordance with WHO recommendations, all work involving infectious SARS-CoV was performed under biosafety level (BSL)-3 conditions in a BSL-3 facility.",

The organic loads used were 0.3% albumin, 10% FCS, and 0.3% albumin with 0.3% sheep erythrocytes. Immediately after incubation for defined periods of time at RT, the mixture was diluted 1:10 with ice-cold MEM and put into an ice bath to avoid an extension of the effective incubation period. Serial 10-fold dilutions with ice-cold MEM were performed to assess virus titres as described above. For each dilution step, eight wells containing suspended cells were inoculated. After three to four days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C in an CO2 incubator, cells were microscopically examined for virus-specific cytopathogenic effects. All tests were performed in triplicate, and for each experiment, a virus control containing MEM instead of disinfectant was included (\u2018control titration\u2019). Further control experiments included formaldehyde (0.7%) as standard disinfectant, and a \u2018termination control\u2019, which is a 1:10 dilution of the disinfectant. This control demonstrates the first 1:10 dilution step in the above mentioned procedure and should verify if a postincubation effect of the disinfectant exists. Furthermore, cytotoxic effects caused by the compounds at various dilutions were assessed in suspended Vero cells in 96-well plates using the MTT Cell Proliferative Kit I (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) as published previously.20, 21 Tests for cytotoxicity were performed as single assays using 10% FCS and disinfectant but without addition of virus.",

The mean RF with the instrument disinfectant was \u22653.3, SD 0.5, which is nearly tenfold below the results of the other disinfectants, due to initial virus titre which was tenfold lower.

That is why the disinfection of surfaces provides additional safety to control the spread of SARS-CoV from inanimate surfaces in an outbreak situation. The three tested surface disinfectants were all effective against SARS-CoV at the concentration and exposure time recommended for routine disinfection of surfaces.15 The recommendation is derived from experimental evidence which includes bactericidal and yeasticidal activity in suspension tests, and which provides sufficient efficacy under practical conditions.15 This spectrum of activity appears to include SARS-CoV. prEN 14476 allows surface disinfectants to be tested at exposure times of 5 and 15 min, as well as 30 and 60 min. Shorter times are more relevant to the exposure times used in practice for surface disinfection (i.e. before drying), and are usually achieved with higher concentrations of the surface disinfectant. Especially in critical areas such as paediatric intensive care, a higher concentration of surface disinfectants provides more safety and is preferable.32\n",

Against other enveloped viruses, an ethanol-based hand rub was also described to be effective under different types of organic load.24 Against the feline calicivirus (FCV), however, there was a significant influence of the type of organic load on the efficacy of 70% ethanol and 70% iso-propanol; FCS did not impair the efficacy against FCV but the presence of albumin or sheep erythrocytes significantly reduced the efficacy of the alcohols.37 Our data indicate that sufficient activity against SARS-CoV can be expected with the tested disinfectants, regardless of the type of organic load.",
