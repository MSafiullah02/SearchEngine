Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung hospital (KMTTH) is a 428-bed community hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Currently, the policy of our hospital is to assess all persons in an outdoor quarantine station to avoid importation of infection. Along with the TOCC history and presence of respiratory symptoms fever is a key warning sign of COVID-19. Therefore, almost all Taiwanese hospitals have established temperature monitoring at outdoor quarantine stations using techniques such as infrared temperature detectors and forehead thermometers. Febrile patients are prohibited from entry and are sent to Emergency Department for assessment. However, these thermometers can normal values, or even hypothermia, in visitors who are actually febrile under the influence of environment factors such as outdoor temperature, wind and rainfall. Erenberk et al reported that accurate determination of fever in cold environmental conditions requires at least 10 minutes for children to become acclimatized after coming in from the cold [6]. Another problem is that some patients may take antipyretics to avoid being blocked at outdoor quarantine stations. The risks of visitors with COVID-19 entering hospitals and staying in crowded waiting areas are very real.
