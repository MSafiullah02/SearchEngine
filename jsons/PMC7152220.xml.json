A variety of mutations can be introduced via a gene-targeting vector, with simplified examples presented in Fig. 1\n. Subsequent gene targeting approaches may also highlight different aspects of vector design. Gene targeting vectors can be designed to incorporate different genetic mutations that allow investigators to answer a specific research hypothesis, whether to study a gene\u2019s function or create mutations similar to those identified in a specific patient population. Original efforts to create transgenic mice were done with viruses, such as Simian Virus 40, and while the transgene was able to pass on to subsequent generations, the integration site was random (Costantini and Lacy, 1981, Gordon and Ruddle, 1981, Jaenisch and Mintz, 1974). In contrast, gene targeting relies on the ability of a cell to recombine different DNA molecules sharing the same sequence through homologous recombination (Capecchi, 1989). A simplified example of gene targeting vector incorporation is shown in Fig. 2\n.",

As seen in Fig. 2, regions of homology are the sites of recombination between 2A and 2B. It is important that the homologous sequences between the endogenous genome and the gene- targeting vector be isogenic, and able to match the strain of mouse being used. Linearization of the targeting vector increases the low frequency of homologous recombination (Brenner et al., 1986, Hasty et al., 1992). Linearization is commonly achieved through restriction enzyme digest of the targeting vector that is then transfected into isolated embryonic stem cells (ES cells).",

            "text": "Despite linearization of the targeting vector and efficient transfection methods, the frequency of homologous recombination remains low. Therefore, positive and negative selection criteria are often utilized to enrich for cells that incorporate the transgene successfully. The positive selection marker is used to identify ES cells that have incorporated the transgene at the correct site. A common positive selection marker is a neomycin-resistance gene (neo) which provides cells resistance against the antibiotic G418 (Sedivy and Sharp, 1989). Addition of the antibiotic G418 allows only cells which express neo to survive, therefore, the neo cassette or other positive selection markers, are positioned between the regions of homology. The neo cassette is flanked by loxP sites that allow Cre recombinase to excise the neo gene, as shown in Fig. 2. It is also possible for the gene-targeting vector to randomly insert into the genome. Negative selection markers, such as herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) marker or diphtheria toxin A (DT-A), can be used to select against these events (Czak\u00f3 and M\u00e1rton, 1994, Yagi et al., 1993). Cells expressing DT-A and HSV-TK produce toxic byproducts that render them unable to survive and thus help to select against random insertions. Negative selection markers are positioned outside of the homology arms to allow selection of undesired incorporations of the gene-targeting vector (Fig. 2B). Subsequent PCR, genomic southern, or sequencing can also be performed to ensure the correct insertion of the gene targeting vector. There are a number of other reviews available to highlight the basic principles of gene targeting (Hall et al., 2009).",

            "text": "A tremendous amount of pioneering work has gone into developing gene targeting methods that have been used as the basis for generating animal models with mutant alleles (Muller, 1999). One of the foundations for this method is the ability to integrate foreign DNA into the genome in a targeted manner. This was first shown by introduction of a modified b-globin gene into the endogenous human b-globin locus (Smithies et al., 1985). The compilation of several studies culminated with the ability to successfully transfect exogenous DNA into murine ES cells and that these modified ES cells could be re-introduced into a recipient blastocyst, creating chimeric progeny (Bradley et al., 1984, Evans and Kaufman, 1981, Thomas and Capecchi, 1987). In this method, ES cells are isolated from donor blastocysts, cultured, transfected with the gene-targeting vector, and selected for expansion. ES cells that have correctly incorporated the gene-targeting vector are then reintroduced into a recipient blastocyst by microinjection, and the recipient blastocyst is implanted into a pseudopregnant female mouse (see extensive review here Adams and van der Weyden, 2008). A common scheme involves modifying the genome of 129S1/SvImJ (129/Sv) mice because of their ease in culturing and ability to be reintroduced into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Chimeric progeny are generally identified by coat color; in this case, consisting of the agouti coat color of the 129/Sv strain and black coat color of the C57BL/6J strain. Mice with the highest percentage agouti coat color are then bred with C57BL/6J mice to verify germ line incorporation of gene targeting vector in subsequent progeny. It is often necessary to further backcross these mice for 10 generations to obtain a pure C57BL/6J background, traditionally one of the major disadvantages of this method. A strategy to overcome this has been to create protocols and conditions by which ES cells from other strains of mice can be modified and used in this scheme (Czechanski et al., 2014). In this approach, a minimum of two generations is needed to obtain mice with ubiquitous incorporation of the transgene and can take several months. A number of other reviews on this topic exist (Bouabe and Okkenhaug, 2013).",

However, recent advances have allowed for the development of endonuclease-based methods to precisely and rapidly create mutant animals. These targetable endonucleases cleave DNA and create double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) which can dramatically increase homologous recombination rates (Bibikova et al., 2001). These DSBs are then repaired either by error prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR) (Carbery et al., 2010, Kandavelou et al., 2009). NHEJ is an error prone repair mechanism that can produce small insertions or deletions (indels) that result in a frameshift.",

Meganucleases are a family of DNA nucleases found in a variety of organisms (Belfort and Roberts, 1997). These nucleases possess a DNA binding domain that recognizes specific nucleotide sequences (Epinat et al., 2003). Both ZFNs and TALENs have emerged as promising technologies to make genomic modification in different model organisms (Cui et al., 2011, Sommer et al., 2015, Wefers et al., 2013). Nucleases, such as ZFNs and TALENs have programmable DNA recognition domains that can be engineered to recognize desired DNA sequences (Kim and Kim, 2014). ZFNs and TALENs are programmed by DNA-protein interactions and therefore, a new protein domain needs to be engineered, which can be laborious. Meganucleases, ZFNs, and TALENs have limited throughput because of the dependence of these systems on protein-DNA interactions, as a new nuclease must be engineered to target different DNA sequences.",

Transformative work has shown how the CRISPR/Cas system (hereafter referred to as CRISPR) functioned as a DNA endonuclease that could be targeted by a single RNA molecule (Jinek et al., 2012). The utility of CRISPR in gene targeting quickly emerged, as a PubMed search for CRISPR yields 1340 results in 2015 alone, highlighting how CRISPR has become the new frontier for the creation of genetically modified organisms. A major advantage of this system is the ease of use, a knockout mouse model can be achieved by inserting Cas9 (Cas nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes) mRNA or protein with a guide RNA (gRNA) into the zygote (Singh et al., 2015). The revolutionary aspect of the CRISPR system lies in the ability to target the nuclease via a gRNA to multiple locations using a single enzyme. For example, Wang et al. (2013) achieved biallelic knockout of two genes, Tet1 and Tet2, simultaneously in a single blastocyst. With previous methods, this would have taken multiple generations of breeding to obtain homozygous knockouts for multiple genes. The same group was then able to show the CRISPR system could be used to tag genes with fluorescent markers or create a conditional allele in one generation (Yang et al., 2013). Using this approach, the authors directly injected the Cas9 mRNA, gRNAs, and DNA constructs to create reporter and conditional alleles by HDR. CRISPR has revolutionized the pace at which we can create transgenic animals. While this technology has shown amazing promise, CRISPR systems have to recognize protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) adjacent to the complementary DNA sequence of the gRNA for successful targeting (Mojica et al., 2009). For example, the Cas9 protein has to recognize a PAM sequence of NGG, however current research efforts are underway to ease this requirement (Kleinstiver et al., 2015). While many of these examples use mice as a model organism, CRISPR has become increasingly popular to edit genomes of other model organisms. A more thorough review detailing the protocol for using CRISPR to edit genomes is provided here (Ran et al., 2013). There are also a number of reviews highlighting the future of this system in genome engineering that may be of interest (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014, Sander and Joung, 2014). The CRISPR-Cas system is changing our ability to create transgenic animal models and enabling our ability to model genetic susceptibility to disease in way that was not previously possible. A simplified CRISPR schematic is illustrated in Fig. 3\n, including the types of alleles that can be readily generated through NHEJ and HDR repair mechanisms.",

Early strategies often used selection markers, such as neo, to disrupt the gene of interest, creating null alleles (Doetschman et al., 1987). However, as sequencing of model organisms has grown, more gene targeting vector schemes can be used to create null alleles. These types of alleles traditionally provide investigators insight into the relevance and function of the gene target in biological and pathological processes. For instance, our group was interested in understanding what role, if any, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 played in hyperoxic lung injury as a model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Lingappan et al., 2014). The results from this study identified Cyp1a1 as playing a protective role against hyperoxic toxicity. Despite the wealth of information that null alleles have provided basic science researchers, these types of alleles generally do not represent patient populations. Consequently, other gene targeting approaches have been developed to more accurately replicate the alleles found in patients.",

Positive selection markers, such as neo, have been used to disrupt or replace a coding exon in the gene of interest, producing a null allele (Buters et al., 1999).

The vast majority of strategies utilize Cre recombinase, a bacteriophage recombinase enzyme that recognizes palindromic sequences, loxP sites, to drive recombination (Abremski and Hoess, 1984, Sternberg and Hamilton, 1981). This system was quickly adopted to manipulate eukaryotic genomes, often to excise DNA between two loxP sites (Sauer and Henderson, 1988). This is often referred to as being \u2018floxed\u2019. Another recombination enzyme system that is used is the Flp-FRT recombinase system. In this system, Flp recombinase, isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, promotes site-specific recombination at FRT sites (Maiti and Sinha, 1992). The directionality of the sites is important, loxP sites must be in the same direction to excise DNA, or the floxed DNA sequence will be inverted. The IMPC project currently uses these systems in combination to generate alleles that can be combined with Flp and Cre mice to generate different alleles (International Mouse Knockout Consortium et al., 2007). The power of these recombinase enzymes lies in the ability to knock-in the cre and frt genes downstream of a desired promoter to achieve spatial or temporal transcriptional control of the recombinase enzyme. The Jackson Laboratory Cre Repository is an excellent resource to search for previously generated Cre strains to match specific research needs.",

For example, spatially regulated Cre expression can allow an investigator to understand how signaling pathways acted in different cell types within the liver to drive liver pathology. The authors used several spatially controlled Cre lines to selectively delete Pten and Tgfbr2 in the liver (Albumin-Cre), as well as AAV8-TBG-Cre to limit Cre expression to hepatocytes (Mu et al., 2016). These types of strategies can help provide more informed conclusions regarding how gene expression in a specific cell type may be contributing to disease pathogenesis. This approach has also proven to be effective to study genes for which the null allele results in embryonic lethality. For example, Kobayashi et al. conditionally knocked out Nrf1 in the central nervous system with Cre driven by the Nestin promoter, allowing for the study of in motor neuron dysfunction (Kobayashi et al., 2011). This approach allowed for interrogation of gene function in a specific biological or pathological context, while maintaining endogenous function in other tissues.

There is a growing number of inducible Cre lines to generate temporally controlled conditional alleles (Feil et al., 2009). One of the more common strategies is to use a Cre recombinase fused to the hormone-binding domain of a mutant murine estrogen receptor that only binds the synthetic analog of estradiol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Danielian et al., 1998). In this strategy, Cre is localized in the cytoplasm until binding of tamoxifen, which allows translocation to the nucleus and facilitates recombination. One of the powers of inducible strategies is that they afford investigators the ability to delete a gene during a specific treatment or time, allowing that gene to fulfill its developmental and homeostatic functions until the experiment is initiated. Another strategy that can be used is to drive Cre expression by a promoter that is only expressed in certain developmental stages. For example, the promoter for the keratin 19 gene (K19) is expressed in early embryonic stages and can drive Cre expression (Means et al., 2005).",

Large-scale genomic and sequencing efforts have identified numerous SNPs and as their effect on disease or phenotype risk grows, modeling these types of alleles in animal models has become increasingly important. For example, missense mutations in B-cardiac myosin heavy chain (B-MHC) account for a significant proportion of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cases (Blankenburg et al., 2014). In the study conducted by Blankenburg et al. (2014), mice carrying a Val606Met substitution had a similar HCM phenotype compared to wild type mice under homeostatic conditions, however, their phenotype was remarkably worsened when given cyclosporine. This is an excellent example of the benefit to toxicology-based research applications, and how incorporating genomic data in animal models to identify risk factors or off target drug effects can be effective.",

This may require extensive knowledge of the gene\u2019s expression profile and identification of critical tissue or cell types. For example, to study the effect of Na +/H + exchanger 3 (Nhe3) in hypertension, Li et al.

The authors describe how Nhe3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice showed phenotypes in the small intestine that may confound their results and prevent correct conclusions. In this study, the authors only wished to restore NHE3 gene expression to the small intestine and maintain the knockout in the kidney.

This is important given that tagging a protein with a reporter gene, such as GFP, can change a protein\u2019s localization or possibly impair its activity. To overcome this limitation, transcripts are generated that contain two proteins that are translated independently, referred to as bicistronic. The first method described was to include an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). This allows for simultaneous expression of the endogenous gene and reporter gene (Yu et al., 2000). More recently, 2A peptide cleavage sites can be included. In this strategy, a 2A peptide sequence is inserted between the gene of interest and the reporter gene so that they are transcribed together, but translated separately (Kim et al., 2011). These approaches may also prove useful in that there are limited reagents available to track expression of your gene of interest and can use reporter gene expression as a surrogate.",

The KOMP is currently working to mutate all protein-encoding genes in the mouse and make them available to investigators while the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) is working to provide publicly basic phenotypic data for those knockout mice (International Mouse Knockout Consortium et al., 2007, Rosen et al., 2015). Large-scale forward genetic screens may be used to identify candidate genes that are positive for a given phenotype. Several repositories and consortiums are working toward knocking out every protein coding gene and providing basic phenotype data that can be made available to the scientific community to allow for reverse genetic screens. Finally, many large scale genomic studies generally make their datasets available online and with the aid of various bioinformatics tools, investigators can tailor their mouse model to most accurately reflect the genetic changes observed in patients in their disease of interest. Several examples are presented below.",

N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) is a chemical agent that causes point mutations to occur randomly in the germ line of male mice (Oliver and Davies, 2012). Breeding these mice with wild type female mice can yield many progeny with random mutations that can then be screened for the phenotype of interest (Nolan et al., 2000). As expected with all screening programs, a large number of mice are needed, and an efficient method for detecting the desired phenotype is needed, which may compromise the value of this approach for an individual investigator. However, these types of large-scale screens are readily done in other model organisms, such as zebrafish. For example, Just et al. found that T-box 20 (Tbx20) is involved in embryonic cardiomyocyte development in an ENU mutagenesis screen (Just et al., 2016).",

These advantages have made Drosophila a favored model organism for forward genetic screens and discovery of candidate genes in a disease model or phenotype (Wolf and Rockman, 2011, Yamamoto et al., 2014). Drosophila is invertebrates that may not replicate human phenotypes accurately and yet, there are phenotypic outputs, in drug discovery applications for example, that can be used to identify candidate genes for testing in other organisms (Pandey and Nichols, 2011). The addition of nuclease-based gene editing technologies in creating precise mutations in a gene of interest is also available in Drosophila (Beumer and Carroll, 2014). Due to the longstanding use of Drosophila in genetics and biomedical research, there is a wealth of online databases, such as Flybase and Flymine available to aid investigators in identifying previously generated fly lines as well as other useful bioinformatics resources (Mohr et al., 2014).",

These vertebrate animals are small and produce large numbers of offspring, also highlighting their convenience in genetic screens (Patton and Zon, 2001). The ability of zebrafish to model human diseases has been reviewed extensively (Lieschke and Currie, 2007). As with other model organisms, targeted nucleases have increased in use in zebrafish as well, enabling rapid generation of new mutant alleles (Hwang et al., 2013). For example, a protocol was developed which CRISPR was used in zebrafish to convert eGFP-transgenic zebrafish into with a Gal4/UAS system (Auer et al., 2014). There are a variety of toxicological research fields, such as chemical and xenobiotic exposure, that have taken advantage of zebrafish models. An example of this is a screening of toxic compounds for estrogenic activity under control by the cyp19a1b gene (Brion et al., 2012). Studies like this with other genes of interest or other toxic effects can be easily completed in zebrafish to quickly adapted with the aid of nuclease-based gene targeting approaches.

Many previous studies that utilized rat models focused on how different rat strains responded to a given experimental approach or treatment and studying these differences (Mark, 1991, Huang et al., 2016, Oltra-Noguera et al., 2015). While technologies to edit the rat genome have existed for some time, only recently with the increasing use of CRISPR technologies and genome sequencing has the ability to edit the rat genome approached the ability of the mouse (Shao et al., 2014). CRISPR has been harnessed to create eGRP and Cre knocking rats, allowing for development conditional and reporter alleles (Ma et al., 2014a). Other groups have successfully reporter simultaneous deletion of multiple genes in one generation in rat embryos with CRISPR (Ma et al., 2014b). The rat has been a preferred animal for pharmacological and toxicological studies in drug discovery because of their physiological similarities. As a means to study calcium signaling and cardiotoxicity in drug discovery applications, Szeb\u00e9nyi et al. (2015) created a transgenic rat model that would express a fluorescent GCaMP2 calcium sensor. In this study, the authors were interested in understanding cardiotoxicity of various antimalarial agents. This is an outstanding example of harnessing newer gene targeting methods and tailoring them to the model organism best suited to address a specific hypothesis.",

            "text": "Animal models have proven to be tremendously valuable in providing insight into the fundamentals of biology and medicine in an effort to model genetic susceptibility to disease. Gene targeting and editing methods and approaches have enabled an unprecedented ability to alter the murine genome and create mutant alleles. While mice have traditionally been at the forefront of modeling genetic diseases, advances in genomics and sequencing are quickly allowing other animal models to be used in this capacity just as easily. This allows other animal models that may be preferred for a given research hypothesis to be used, ideally increasing our ability to translate findings in animal models to humans. With the advent of gene-editing endonuclease technology coupled with large-scale human genomic datasets, investigators are now able to identify candidate mutations in animal models, and create necessary alleles at a pace that was not possible 5 years ago. We are now able to identify genetic markers associated with xenobiotic toxicity or chemotherapy resistance that can be generated in mice in months as opposed to years. Other tools, such as conditional knockouts and humanized models are allowing for more precise interrogation of gene function and more accurate translation of data from animal models to humans. These improvements in gene editing technology and approaches are allowing unprecedented ability to characterize the toxicity of chemical compounds on physiology and model genetic susceptibility to disease.",
