While prophylactic vaccines can confer immunity against circulating virus strains, their effectiveness and extent of immunization coverage vary across populations from year to year. This variability contributed in part to the recent and notable 2017\u20132018 seasonal outbreak which is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to have caused approximately 710,000 hospitalizations and up to 79,400 deaths in the United States alone (CDC, 2018; Rolfes et al., 2019). Of particular concern are less common but historically regular pandemic outbreaks in populations with limited or no immunity that can result in hundreds of thousands to millions of deaths worldwide. Moreover, there still remains a significant technical gap to expedite a rapid vaccine production response, particularly in the face of an increasingly global spread of newly-emergent virus strains (Renaud et al., 2011; Hurt, 2014). Thus, additional countermeasures against IAV in the form of prophylactic and therapeutic antivirals continue to be needed.",

M2 is a proton-gated proton channel that belongs to a growing viroporin family of virus proteins. M2 ion channel activity is required for IAV replication, and adamantane-based M2 inhibitors including amantadine (1) and rimantadine (2; Fig. 1\n) were historically used as influenza antivirals. However, adamantane-resistant virus strains are now prevalent to the point that these drugs are no longer recommended for therapeutic use (Bright et al., 2005; Deyde et al., 2007; Fiore et al., 2011; Hayden and De Jong, 2011). More than 95% of circulating adamantane-resistant viruses harbor a serine to asparagine mutation at amino acid position 31 in M2 (Ser31Asn; Bright et al., 2005), which distorts adamantane interactions within the pore without significantly affecting M2 ion channel activity or the fitness of viral replication (Balannik et al., 2010; Grambas et al., 1992; Pinto et al., 1992; Stouffer et al., 2008). Therefore, a major goal of current studies is to identify new inhibitors of adamantane-resistant M2.",

            "text": "The M2 protein of IAV is arguably the best understood viroporin. It consists of a 97 amino acid, type I transmembrane domain-containing protein which forms a tetrameric ion channel that is both proton-gated and proton-selective (Hong and DeGrado, 2012; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015). M2 is a multifunctional, modular protein where each segment performs one or more distinct function(s) (Wang et al., 2011c). Following viral entry, M2 expressed on the virion membrane transports protons from host cell endosomes to acidify the virion interior (Fig. 2\n). This low pH environment facilitates conformational changes in viral hemagglutinin (HA) and dissociation of viral ribonucleoprotein complex from M1 proteins to promote virion membrane fusion and release of viral RNA into the host cell. M2 proton gating function is, however, not required per se to convert HA into the membrane fusion competent state (Bui et al., 1996; Gutman et al., 1993; Martin and Heleniust, 1991). During viral egress, M2 also equilibrates the pH of trans-Golgi lumina and the cytoplasm, which may delay trafficking of virion particles and/or prevent HA from inappropriately adopting a low pH conformation (Alvarado-Facundo et al., 2015; Ciampor et al., 1992; Li et al., 2014; Pinto and Lamb, 2006; Sugrue et al., 1990). Compared to other influenza proteins, the sequence of M2 is highly conserved but has been shown to co-evolve with HA (Grambas et al., 1992; Rossman and Lamb, 2011). As such, M2's conductance rate closely correlates with HA's fusogenic propensity, where increased proton conductance by M2 correlates with more acid labile HA sequences (Grambas et al., 1992; Scholtissek et al., 1998). M2 has also been found to localize at the virus budding site on the host cell surface, where the amphipathic helix of M2 alters membrane curvature leading to membrane scission and release of new viral progeny (Chen et al., 2008; Rossman and Lamb, 2011; Rossman et al., 2010). Although protons are the preferred substrate, M2 can also act as a Na+ and K+ antiporter (Leiding et al., 2010). In particular, the ability of M2 to pass bulkier K+ ions becomes physiologically relevant in the endocytic pathway, where high Na+ concentration in early endosome clusters is replaced by K+ to allow for the subsequent release of the viral ribonucleoprotein bundle (Stauffer et al., 2014).",

Notably, a fragment of M2 encompassing the transmembrane domain and spanning as little as amino acids 21\u201351 was observed by TEVC to be sufficient to produce amantadine-sensitive, proton-dependent proton currents (Ma et al., 2009). To a first approximation, transmembrane mutations that are predicted to increase the pore radius (i.e., mutation to residues with smaller side chains) result in increased proton conduction, presumably either through the enhanced formation of water wires or transfer by His37 through conformational changes, while mutations to residues with bulkier side chains that reduce the pore radius also reduce conductance. For example, the introduction of Ala at Val27, which faces the extracellular and intraluminal surfaces and is thought to form the most constricted part of the channel, increases the pore entrance size and obliterates the N-terminal gating mechanism, thereby allowing for easier pore hydration and enhanced conduction (Balannik et al., 2010; Holsinger et al., 1994; Pielak and Chou, 2010). In contrast, introduction of bulky and/or hydrophobic residues such as Phe or Trp at Val27 results in non- or low-conducting M2 proteins. Similarly, mutations that reduce pore size at other locations including Ala30Trp, Ala30Pro, and Gly34Glu also slow the rate of proton conduction and frequently result in loss-of-function (Balannik et al., 2010).",

Mutation of His37 to Gly or Gln results in enhanced conductance but also loss of proton selectivity and/or lack of pH dependence (Balannik et al., 2010; Wang et al., 1995). Moreover, mutation of Trp41 to Ala, Cys or Phe results in larger inward currents but also outward currents, indicating that Trp41 regulates unidirectional conductance (Balannik et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2013). Another key residue, Ser31, is likely to face the pore interior, and its mutation to hydrophobic residues such as Ala negatively affects pore hydration, resulting in diminished conduction. At the other end of the His-Trp quartet, mutating Asp44 to hydrophobic residues such as Ala affects proton exit at the C-terminal end of the channel by increasing the energy barrier (Pielak et al., 2011). These and other mutations might also impact M2 function by indirectly affecting the inherent conduction moiety defined by the His37 tetrad or the gating mechanism defined by Trp41 (Gu et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2013).",

            "text": "While the mechanisms of proton shuttling that enable conduction remain incompletely understood, it is likely that experimental conditions such as pH, peptide length, lipid/detergent composition and thickness, and binding of small molecules affect the fundamental properties of M2 (Acharya et al., 2010; S. Cady et al., 2011a, Cady et al., 2011b; Du et al., 2012; Kolokouris et al., 2019; Kovacs et al., 2000; Thomaston et al., 2013; Zhou and Cross, 2013). Among the available M2 structures in PDB, 2RLF and 3C9J were among the first structures solved using solution NMR and X-ray crystallography in micelles, respectively (Schnell and Chou, 2008; Stouffer et al., 2008). Hu et al. (2010) and Sharma et al. (2010) subsequently applied solid state NMR and molecular dynamics to explore the activation and conduction mechanisms of M2 at low pH (using PDB entries 2KQT, and 2L0J; Cady et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2010). Although both studies support a \u201cproton-relay\u201d model of conduction, they differ with regard to the side-chain conformation of His37. The study by Hu et al. (2010) proposes a tightly-packed His37 tetrad which undergoes numerous reorientations and side chain rotations to relay protons. In contrast, the model by Sharma et al. (2010) suggests three distinct states for the His-Trp quartet: the \u2018\u2018histidine-locked state\u2019\u2019, the \u2018\u2018activated state\u2019\u2019, and the \u2018\u2018conducting state\u2019\u2019, with transition between these states allowing for proton conductance. In this model, the \u201chistidine locked state\u201d exists when a proton is shared between two adjacent histidine residues (HisH+-His) and the channel is locked in the non-conducting state. They further described the activation cascade at low extracellular pH, when a single hydronium ion approaches the non-protonated histidine in the HisH+-His dimer, breaks this ionic bond, and transitions the channel to the \u201cactivated state\u201d, resulting in the formation of stable cation-p interactions between His37 and Trp41. The Trp41 tetrad forms a gate at the C-terminal end, and the perturbation of this cation-p interaction leads to conformational changes which in turn transition the quartet to the \u201cconduction state\u201d. Here, protons are then donated to water molecules and relayed to the intracellular side (Fig. 4\n). The transition between these three steps requires small changes of the \u03c72 angles of the His37 and Trp41 side chains. This contrasts with the model by Hu et al. (2010), where considerable reorientation of His37 and Trp41 residues are required to allow proton passage. Further experimental and theoretical data supporting both models are described in detail elsewhere (Hong and DeGrado, 2012; Thomaston et al., 2019; Watkins et al., 2019; Zhou and Cross, 2013).",

As M2 can also equilibrate pH across the trans-Golgi network and the cytoplasm, amantadine-based M2 inhibition may also disrupt viral egress (Lamb, R.A. and Krug, 2001; Takeda et al., 2003).",

However, during the first decade following its licensure, Symmetrel was not widely prescribed due in part to side effects such as agitation, confusion, and hallucinations (Keyser et al., 2000). Additionally, the molecular mechanism describing a direct link between amantadine and virus inhibition was not described until more than 25 years later (Duff and Ashley, 1992; Pinto et al., 1992). Rimantadine, sold under the brand name Flumadine, is a methylated derivative of amantadine which was licensed by FDA for the same indications in 1994.",

In the first reported crystallographic structure of M2-bound amantadine at pH 5.3 (PDB: 3C9J), Stouffer et al. (2008) suggested that amantadine binds in a pocket located inside the intraluminal cavity and surrounded by the nonpolar side chains of Val27, Ala30, the C\u03b2 group of Ser31, and the C\u03b1 group of Gly34 (Fig. 5A). In this pore binding model, the authors proposed that amantadine, by entering the lumen of the channel, \u201cplugs\u201d the M2 pore and thus prevents the transport of protons. The model further suggests that Ser31Asn confers adamantane resistance by decreasing the pore size and occluding stable access of amantadine to the pore (Stouffer et al., 2008).",

In these studies, rimantadine was found to bind to Asp44 on the C-terminal, lipid-facing side of the helices. The solution NMR structure (PDB: 2RLF), solved at pH 7.5, showed an allosteric mechanism of inhibition where four drug molecules were proposed to stabilize the inactivated state of M2, thereby preventing proton-gated M2 opening and proton transfer. In this binding mechanism, perturbation of the extra-luminal drug binding pocket as a result of Ser31Asn mutation rendered rimantadine incapable of effectively binding to the allosteric site (Pielak et al., 2009).",

By mutating the critical Asp44 residue to alanine, Jing and coworkers continued to observe inhibition by amantadine in both electrophysiological and antiviral plaque assays, suggesting that the allosteric-binding site is not pharmacologically essential (Jing et al., 2008). Additionally, in a chimeric ion channel based on the M2 of influenza B, which is normally amantadine-insensitive due to a larger and more hydrophilic transmembrane pore (Mould et al., 2003), substitution with the M2 transmembrane domain from influenza A restored amantadine sensitivity (Jing et al., 2008). Using solid-state NMR, Cady et al. (2010) also reported that the channel pore was the preferred binding site (PDB: 2KQT), where amantadine preferentially localized to a hydrophobic cage formed by Ala30, Ser31, and Gly34. Hydrophobic interactions between Val27 side chains and the adamantane cage were also observed, and the ammonium group of amantadine showed hydrogen bonding to water molecules and pore-facing residues that stabilized its interactions in the occluded pore. The authors also reported that interactions with the allosteric binding site were observed only at high amantadine concentrations and were thus less probable as the primary mode of M2 inhibition. In further support of the pore-binding model, mutation of Asp44, proposed as the key residue of the allosteric binding mechanism, to six different amino acids (Asp44Ala, Asp44Lys, Asp44Asn, Asp44Phe, Asp44Gly, and Asp44Thr) did not affect inhibition by amantadine (Balannik et al., 2010). Notably, in further testing their initial hypothesis of an allosteric binding site of amantadine to M2, Pielak et al. (2011) next generated an M2 chimera where the C-terminus was derived from the amantadine-insensitive M2 of influenza B virus (PDB: 2LJB). Contrary to their previously proposed allosteric binding mechanism, using solution NMR, they described the rimantadine binding pocket to be preserved within the pore of the chimeric M2 protein. In a series of surface plasmon resonance experiments, the pore-binding site was also found to be more energetically favorable than the allosteric binding site, although the latter did remain sensitive to amantadine (Rosenberg and Casarotto, 2010).",

Gu et al. (2011) also applied molecular dynamics approaches to study the antagonistic effects of known M2 inhibitors and observed that, while interactions with the pore-binding site were more thermodynamically stable, ligands bound slowly and poorly dissociated due to a high energy barrier of binding. In contrast, the allosteric binding was readily accessible, the energy barrier for binding was minimal, and drug binding was less stable and more readily dissociated. Moreover, the initial NMR structure (PDB: 2RLF) did not show evidence of an intraluminal binding site but rather binding at the allosteric peripheral site in the lipid interface. However, this can also be interpreted by noting that the NMR structure was narrower as compared to the counterpart X-ray structure (PDB: 3C9J) due to a smaller tilt angle which resulted in transmembrane helices being overly parallel. This finding further alerted the field to the importance of the protein crystallization environment and emphasised the risk of crystal packing distortions across all published crystal structures (Cross et al., 2012).",

However, a subsequent series of in vitro and cellular assays, electrophysiology experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that both enantiomers exhibited similar channel blockade in TEVC experiments, comparable antiviral activity in plaque assays, and similar free energies of binding in isothermal titration calorimetry and computational simulations (Drakopoulos et al., 2017).

Large-scale sequence analyses of circulating IAV strains indicate that Leu26Phe, Val27Ala and Ser31Asn are the three major adamantane-resistance mutations found in transmissible viruses (Furuse et al., 2009a, 2009b). Among these, Ser31Asn is the prevalent mutation in more than 95% of adamantane-resistant strains (Dong et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2009), although a recent study reported a potential rise in the frequency of virus strains containing the Val27Ala and Ser31Asn double mutations (Durrant et al., 2014). A recent crystallography study reported that elimination of hydrophobic contacts that are essential for adamantane drug binding is the underlying cause behind adamantane resistance to Val27Ala mutant (Thomaston et al., 2020). In contrast to the Val27Ala single mutation that results in complete resistance to amantadine, M2 sequences containing Ser31Asn can still be inhibited by amantadine in vitro, albeit with approximately 200-fold higher concentrations in TEVC experiments and plaque reduction assays (PRAs) and substantially higher than what is therapeutically-achievable (Wang et al., 2013a). Notably, the Ser31Asn mutation has been isolated in curated virus strains that were in circulation before use of adamantanes, and so the prevalence of the Ser31Asn mutation in the wild may not be exclusively the result of drug selection pressure. This contrasts with mutations such as Val27Ala which appear more likely than Ser31Asn to have evolved as a result of drug selection pressure (Furuse et al., 2009a, 2009b).",

For example, the solution NMR structure (PDB: 2RLF; Schnell and Chou, 2008) presents Ser31 between two alpha-helices, and its mutation to the larger asparagine expands the pore by creating a kink in each monomer which would be expected to result in higher conductance. In contrast, the crystal structure (PDB: 3C9J; Stouffer et al., 2008) shows Ser31 facing the pore, where mutation to asparagine decreases the pore size and would be expected to reduce conductance. However, Holsinger et al. (1994) did not observe a difference in the rate of proton conduction due to the Ser31Asn mutation as measured by single electrode electrophysiology recordings. This result was further confirmed by Balannik et al. (2010) in two-electrode voltage clamp assay in which S31N mutant had indistinguishable specific conductance as M2 WT. Regardless, being located at a pore lining residue, the Ser31Asn mutation is likely to alter the diameter as well as the polarity and dynamics of the channel pore, resulting in changes between the observed interactions of the Ser31Asn channel and amantadine when compared to WT M2 (Gleed et al., 2015). Interestingly, in the solved X-ray crystal structure for M2 containing the Ser31Asn mutation (PDB: 5C02; (Thomaston and DeGrado, 2016; Thomaston et al., 2018, 2019), in the absence of a drug molecule in the pore and in the Inwardopen state, Asn31 was found to face the pore and was stabilized by H-bonds formed with the carbonyl groups of neighboring Asn31 (Fig. 3A). This arrangement sterically constricts the adamantane binding site in the pore. In contrast, in the Inwardclosed state, Asn31 was tucked away from the centre of the pore and stabilized by forming H-bonds with carbonyls at the monomer-monomer interface, thereby twisting the helices and narrowing the pore near the binding site (Fig. 3B). Alternatively, using a solution NMR structure Wang et al., 2013a, Wang et al., 2013b demonstrated that the Asn31 carboxamide could be stabilized in a pore-facing conformation through a bidentate interaction with the M2-S31N inhibitor M2WJ332 (compound 4; Table 2; Fig. 6\nB). These observations further emphasize that the orientation of Asn31 in the pore is dependent on the conformational state of the protein and/or the presence of interacting drug molecule in the lumen of the pore.",

            "text": "Among the many molecules synthesized and tested by the DeGrado group, compounds 3 and 4 emerged as the first promising candidates of M2 Ser31Asn inhibition. TEVC experiments revealed 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 14 and 16 \u03bcM for 3 and 4, respectively, against the Ser31Asn form of M2, which was comparable to amantadine's inhibition of WT M2 in the authors' hands (16 \u03bcM; Wang et al., 2013a). Moreover, compound 4 bound to Ser31Asn M2 with such high affinity that structure determination by solution NMR was possible. In their structure model (PDB: 2LY0), 4 was found to be clamped between the side chains of three Asn31 residues while having its amine group pointing towards the M2 N-terminus (Fig. 6B). The adamantane cage fit within the hydrophobic pocket between Asn31 and Gly34, and the positively charged ammonium group of the adamantane formed hydrogen bonds via water molecules with two asparagines, while the third asparagine and the nitrogen of isoxazole of 4 formed a bidentate interaction. The side-chain carbonyl of Asn received a hydrogen bond from the ammonium group, and the carboxamide of the same Asn donated a hydrogen bond to the endocyclic nitrogen of isoxazole. On the other end of compound 5, the thiophene moiety sit against four methyl groups of Val27 and was stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Notably, this distal hydrophobic group could be substituted by other similar moieties such as benzene (3) and cyclopropane (5) without substantially compromising efficacy. Molecular dynamics experiments also supported the potential drug-protein interactions observed in NMR experiments. Numerous additional inhibitors of M2 Ser31Asn have since been reported by the DeGrado and Wang laboratories: for example, compound 6 inhibited 74.4% of M2 Ser31Asn activity by TEVC and virus replication with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 1.7 \u03bcM (Li et al., 2016a, 2016b; 2017) in PRA. Notably, compound 6 also inhibited 12% of WT M2 channel activity by TEVC at 100 \u03bcM (Li et al., 2016a).",

Additionally, based on their previous findings in identifying a dual inhibitor of WT and Val27Ala M2 (10), Hu et al., 2017a, Hu et al., 2017b designed and reported the first class of organosilanes that exhibited potent antiviral activity against amantadine-resistant and oseltamivir-resistant viruses.

This mutation was also co-observed with an occasional Asn31Ser mutation which reverted back to Asn31 upon drug withdrawal. In contrast, passaging with the dual inhibitor compound 8 resulted in Asn31Asp and Ile32Thr mutations which also reverted after drug withdrawal (Ma et al., 2016).

Remarkably, unlike amantadine, which readily gave rise to resistance after a single passage in vitro, compounds 14 and 15 required 4\u20135 passages before two resistance mutations (Val27Ile and Leu26Ile respectively) were detected in vitro, suggesting a higher genetic barrier to resistance. Interestingly, reversion of M2 back to Ser31 was not observed. Further passaging of Ser31Asn + Leu26Ile virus with 15 at higher concentrations selected for a third Ala30Thr. Notably, while both M2 and viruses containing Ser31Asn + Val27Ile or Leu26Ile exhibited similar proton conductance properties and viral replication fitness relative to the single Ser31Asn mutant, the addition of Ala30Thr to Ser31Asn and Leu26Ile resulted in substantially reduced M2 proton conductance and viral replication.

Interestingly, Leu46Pro did not significantly change proton conductance or amantadine sensitivity on its own in WT M2. However, in the presence of Ser31Asn, the Leu46Pro mutation rendered compounds 14\u201316 ineffective in TEVC experiments. Through molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations, the authors proposed that Leu46Pro, despite being located outside of the canonical M2 binding sites of adamantanes, could affect the size of the M2 pore where compounds 14\u201316 were proposed to interact (Musharrafieh et al., 2019). Taken together, these results suggest that when compared to amantadine and WT M2, the genetic barrier for drug resistance is likely to be higher for adamantane-derived compounds that target M2 Ser31Asn, at least in vitro.",

For example, Compounds 5, 8, 10, and 16 have been reported to inhibited virus strains with resistance to the licensed neuramindase inhibitor oseltamivir (Hu et al., 2017a; Ma et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). In oseltamivir-sensitive viruses, 5 and 16 also synergized with oseltamivir, raising the possibility of combination therapies where lower doses of drugs can be used to minimize the risk of toxicities without sacrificing antiviral efficacy (Ma et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). Compound 16 also exhibited favorable in vitro pharmacokinetic properties such as half-life of at least 145 min in mouse and human liver microsome stability assays. It also exhibited good cellular permeability in Caco-2 cells (\u223c28 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm/s) and did not inhibit a panel of five CYP enzymes. (Wang et al., 2018). Additional M2 Ser31Asn adamantane-derived inhibitors have shown similar supportive preclinical results, indicating that these properties are fairly common for this chemical class (Hu et al., 2018). Furthermore, injection of mice with the dual-inhibitor compound 9 at up to 100 mg/kg/day resulted in no changes in body weight. Importantly, at up to 100 mg/kg/day, compound 9 also rescued mice from lethal infection of viruses containing either WT M2 or M2 Val27Ala, thereby demonstrating in vivo efficacy (Hu et al., 2017a). While initial results are encouraging, in vivo results for most adamantane derivatives remain limited and await further study.",

In an independent attempt to change the shape and bulk of the adamantane cage, Zhao et al. (2012) reported the discovery of pinanamine derivatives as inhibitors of M2 Ser31Asn. Specifically, an imidazole derivative of pinanamine (19) showed a moderate inhibitory effect against A/WSN/33 (H1N1) in a cytopathic effect inhibition assay (CPE; EC50 = 95.5 \u03bcM). Dong et al.

However, HMA has several off-target effects and is cytotoxic at low micromolar concentrations (Jalily et al., 2016; Premkumar et al., 2004). Recently, a series of HMA derivatives were designed through iterative medicinal chemistry and electrophysiological testing approaches (Jalily et al., 2016). Among these compounds, 24 exhibited activity against WT M2 in single electrode voltage clamp (SEVC) experiments, which was comparable to amantadine in these studies (IC50 0.2 \u03bcM vs 0.6 \u03bcM), but was not obviously toxic to cells. While 24 was found to be active against WT M2 only, an elongated derivative (25) exhibited dual-inhibitory effects against WT and Ser31Asn M2 in SEVC (respective IC50s = 0.6 \u03bcM and 4.4 \u03bcM) and PRA (respective EC50s = 40 \u03bcM and 18 \u03bcM). Additionally compound 26, although inhibiting WT M2 with lower efficacy (20% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM) than 25 in SEVC, was more effective at inhibiting viruses encoding WT and Ser31Asn M2 in PRA (EC50s = 6.9 and 1.5 \u03bcM, respectively). Preliminary data indicate that 23 exhibits stability in human microsome assays (t1/2 = 70 min) and mouse plasma following injection in vivo (t1/2 = 60 min). Moreover, injection of compound 23 at 2 mg/kg did not affect the monitored ECG or hemodynamic parameters in mice, and 200 \u03bcM of cumulative dosing of 23 over a course of 3 h did not cause obvious cardiac toxicity (P.

            "text": "The two-electrode voltage clamp assay remains the most effective assay for M2 ion channel studies, as it is less technically demanding and more likely to be replicated across independent laboratory groups when compared to SEVC. In general, there is a liner correlation between the percentage channel blockage from TEVC and the antiviral activity (Li et al., 2017). However, we also note that the efficacies of certain M2 inhibitors as measured by TEVC and PRA can be discordant. For example, for compounds 4, 7, 9, 12, and 15, the IC50 values detected by TEVC are substantially higher than EC50 values by PRA. In contrast, the IC50 values detected for compounds 13, 24, and 25 by TEVC are lower than their PRA EC50 values. Discrepancies in both cases might arise from different binding kinetics of various M2 channel blockers (Wang et al., 2018). The IC50 values from TEVC or SEVC measurements are normally plotted using percentage inhibition at a given time point after compound perfusion, therefore the IC50 values may not accurately reflect the true binding potency of the compounds. Instead, kinetic measurements of the K\nd values are a more stringent way to determine the true binding potency of M2 channel blockers. However, kinetic measurements are labor intense and are often reserved as a secondary assay to characterize lead candidates that have already shown potent antiviral activity such as compound 16. Nevertheless, it is understandable that the lack of a straight linear correlation between the results from the in vitro TEVC or SEVC assay and the cellular CPE or PRA assay might also be additionally due to other factors such as a compound's membrane permeability, virus strain differences, or other off-target effects. However, this is not a specific issue related to M2 channel blockers per se, as other drug candidates commonly face this challenge as well. In some cases, discordance also extends to M2 proteins and viruses containing different mutations. For example, compound 9 inhibits M2 Val27Ala with lower IC50s than M2 WT (0.3 and 18 \u03bcM, respectively), while the EC50s in PRA are the opposite (i.e. 1.8 and 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively). Similar results are also seen for compounds 7, 10, and 20 and could reflect, for example, differences in virus strains used and/or subtle changes in the binding kinetics of these compounds against different M2 forms. Thus, as with other drug development efforts, interpretation of specific results for individual compounds must be performed carefully and on a case-by-case basis.",

The optimization of methods including TEVC and SEVC has also allowed us to study the fundamental biophysical properties of M2 variants and how small molecules engage and inhibit these channels. However, the inherent limitations of traditional electrophysiology such as low throughput, technical demands, and inaccessibility of the technique to many research groups have largely restricted screening and discovery of novel M2 inhibitors to a few specialized laboratories (Wang et al., 2015). Toward addressing these limitations, recently developed systems with the capacity or potential of automated electrophysiology screening could substantially reduce the time, complexity and cost associated with manual traditional patch clamp experiments, particularly in the context of SEVC. Notably, the companies Sophion (QPatch), Nanion (Patchliner) and Fluxion (IonFlux) have developed automated systems where screening of tens or hundreds of compounds could, in principle, be performed by SEVC in one day (Priest et al., 2017).",

In these assays, M2 expression inhibits yeast growth, as measured by culture turbidity, which in turn is restored by administration of M2 inhibitors. As shown by Balgi and Roberge (2009), amantadine restored the growth of yeast expressing WT M2 from 27% of control to 95% at 1 \u03bcM. This assay was further optimized for high throughput screening: for example, the authors subsequently screened \u223c250,000 compounds and identified 21 new and potent inhibitors of WT M2 (Balgi et al., 2013). These reports demonstrate that growth restoration assays are a sensitive, economical and technically simple technique for high throughput screening for inhibitors of M2 and presumably other viroporins. A similar expression system using E. coli has also been used to assess the properties of random M2 mutations (Santner et al., 2018b), although results from these assays do not consistently agree with results obtained by TEVC (Musharrafieh et al., 2019; Santner et al., 2018a).",

Yet another challenge imposed against rational drug design is the dependence of such highly flexible proteins on their surrounding environment, which in turn affects their function. In contrast to thermostable proteins that encompass tight hydrophobic cores, viral proteins are frequently loosely packed, resulting not only in a smaller difference in energy levels between folded and unfolded states, but also a reduced contribution of random mutations or interactions with chemical inhibitors to overall stability (Paciaroni et al., 2002). This equips viruses with enormous adaptive mechanisms to buffer the deleterious effects of random mutations; even more in the case of RNA viruses which intrinsically mutate faster than DNA viruses (Tokuriki et al., 2009). These challenges also apply to M2, where until recently the lack of high-resolution structures had impeded the advancement of rational drug design. Other obstacles that have prevented the successful design of a universal M2 inhibitor include the constricted drug binding site, technical difficulties in effective measurement of drug inhibition, and absence of reliable protocols to assess protein drug interactions.",

The M2 viroporin, a proton-dependent proton channel required for virus entry and egress, has historically been an effective antiviral target for drugs like amantadine and rimantadine. However, mutations in M2, particularly lining the pore where adamantanes interact, are now widespread and have rendered these therapies ineffective. Over the past decade, new inhibitors of drug-resistant M2 consisting of both adamantane derivatives and new chemical scaffolds have been found that inhibit M2 ion conduction, as demonstrated using both electrophysiological techniques in vitro influenza replication assays. The most promising leads also inhibit multiple adamantine-sensitive and resistant forms of M2 (e.g., compounds 7\u201310, 12, 17\u201318, 22, 25), inhibit viruses with major resistance to other IAV antivirals like oseltamivir (5, 8, 10, 16) and/or synergize with oseltamivir (5, 16, 28), exhibit high genetic barriers to resistance following long-term in vitro passaging (5, 8, 14\u201316), have supportive preclinical parameters such as good stability and low toxicity (9, 16, 23), and rescue mice from lethal infection (9). Going forward, further discovery of new chemical scaffolds and/or optimization of existing leads by medicinal chemistry may be enabled by emerging technologies to screen for and monitor M2 conductance. In addition, demonstration of clinical efficacy of new chemical leads remains to be achieved. The coming decade will likely show whether new M2 inhibitors can significantly add to the evolving armamentarium of antivirals to combat current and emerging seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.",
