Our phylogenetic analysis targets species from sections that have not previously been studied, such as sect. Polytrichum (Whalen) Child, and samples more intensively from three clades that were previously underrepresented in molecular studies (the Torva, Micracantha, and Erythrotrichum clades). These groups have unclear limits and species compositions that have varied in previous classifications. In Nee's (1999) classification, these three clades account for 82 of the 185 species (44%) of the New World spiny solanums. Additionally, our phylogenetic analysis samples from geographic areas that have been underrepresented, including Brazil and the Caribbean, and specifically targets species in sect. Polytrichum and sect. Persicariae Dunal that are endemic to these areas.",

We sampled 58 additional species of spiny solanums from groups that were not well represented in Levin & al. (2006) . Selected species from clades that Levin & al. (2006) sampled extensively or that are the focus of other studies were included only to show their higher-level relationships. These groups include the Lasiocarpa clade (Bohs, 2004) , the Acanthophora clade (Levin & al., 2005) , the Androceras clade (Stern & al., 2010) , and the Old World clade (Martine & al., 2006; L. Bohs & al., unpub. data) . Focal groups of this study include the Torva, Micracantha, and Erythrotrichum clades. The spiny species S. polygamum Vahl was placed within the Leptostemonum clade in Levin & al. (2006) but was not resolved within any of the major clades. It was excluded from this study because its sequences were divergent for all sampled markers, making unambiguous alignment difficult. Spiny solanums in the S. wendlandii and S. nemorense species groups that have been shown to lie outside of the Leptostemonum clade (Levin & al., 2006) were also included. Non-spiny Solanum species in the Geminata (S. argentinum, S. pseudocapsicum, S. arboreum), Brevantherum (S. abutiloides and S. cordovense), Cyphomandra (S. betaceum, S. diploconos, S. glaucophyllum), Morelloid (S. ptychanthum), and Dulcamaroid (S. dulcamara) clades sensu Bohs (2005) and Weese & Bohs (2007) were included as outgroups and the tree was rooted using S. laciniatum, a member of the Archaesolanum clade, which was previously shown to be even more distantly related to the spiny solanums (Levin & al., 2006; Weese & Bohs, 2007) .

Solanum hieronymi and S. multispinum were placed with members of the Carolinense clade in Nee's (1999) sect.

Although there are striking morphological differences within this group, most notably in the diminutive leaves, flowers, and fruits of S. polyacanthos, these species are united by their scattered needle-like prickles, deeply stellate corollas, small juicy red or black fruits on strongly recurved fruiting pedicels, and the presence of stellate hairs on the adaxial surface of the anthers, an unusual characteristic within the spiny solanums (Whalen, 1984; Strickland-Constable & al., 2010) .

This morphological convergence is likely due to the clades inhabiting similar arid habitats in North and South America. Like the Carolinense clade, the Elaeagnifolium clade has a large geographical disjunction, with some members found in the United States and Mexico (S. hindsianum, S. tridynamum), others in South America (S. mortonii), and with S. elaeagnifolium found in both areas. Whalen (1984) placed S. elaeagnifolium in the S. ellipticum species group and S. tridynamum in the S. vespertilio species group. However, these groups both contained species from the Old and New World and are clearly not monophyletic since nearly all of the Old World spiny solanums form a clade (see below). Whalen left S. hindisanum unplaced and did not treat S. mortonii. Nee (1999) placed the members of the Elaeagnifolium clade in sect. Melongena subsect. Lathyrocarpum. However, this subsection also contained species that our results place in different clades, such as S. aridum, S. comptum, and S. juvenale (Carolinense clade), S. hasslerianum (Sisymbriifolium clade), and S. hieronymi and S. multispinum, which are unassigned to any of the 14 clades.",

This clade represents a large radiation with a wide range of phenotypes. No single or combination of morphological characters appears to define this group. The main feature defining this clade is its geographical location, as very few species of Old World spiny solanums fall outside of the Old World clade. A few notable exceptions, such as S. torvum of the Torva clade are introductions from the New World, whereas a few taxa such as S. lasiocarpum and S. repandum of the Lasiocarpa clade apparently represent independent radiations into the Old World from New World ancestors. Detailed study of the Old World spiny solanums is underway and will help to clarify relationships within this clade (M. Vorontsova & al., unpub. data; L. Bohs & al., unpub. data) .",

Whalen (S. citrullifolium, S. rostratum, S. grayi) form a strongly supported monophyletic group nested within a larger clade of species placed in Whalen's (1984) S. crinitum species group and Nee's (1999) sect.

While Whalen (1984) did not treat either S. coriaceum or S. sendtnerianum, Nee (1999) placed these species in sect. Micracantha based on their viny habit. However, other morphological characters, including large flowers and fruits with swellings on the fruiting calyx, support the relationship of these taxa with sect. Crinitum. Whalen (1984) left S. mitlense as an unplaced taxon but suggested it might be related to the S. torvum species group, whereas Nee (1999) tentatively placed it within sect. Crinitum, also suggesting that it might be a derived member of sect. Torva. These placements were likely due to the disjunct distribution of S. mitlense in Mexico where many species of sect. Torva are common, whereas the other species in sect. Crinitum are restricted to South America. The morphological characters of S. mitlense, including habit and flower, fruit, and seed size, are all typical of sect. Crinitum (F. Farruggia, unpub. data).",

A more detailed study of sect. Androceras (Stern & al., 2010) showed that the section is monophyletic and sister to a monophyletic sect. Crinitum, which includes S. mitlense and S. sendtnerianum (S. coriaceum was not sampled). This difference in our parsimony analysis and the result of Stern & al.

This contrasts with sect. Crinitum, which is composed of large shrubs, trees, or woody vines with some of the largest flowers and fruits in the genus. Members of sect.

We included two additional species not previously sampled, S. vaillantii and an undescribed Brazilian species which our data place in the Acanthophora clade. Whalen (1984) and Nee (1999) placed S. vaillantii in their S. mammosum species group and sect. Acanthophora, respectively. These groups correspond to our Acanthophora clade. The undescribed species matches the description given for Solanum sp. 1 in Mentz & Oliveira (2004) and a named but unpublished species included in Nee (1979) . It is from southeastern Brazil and has morphological characters that are typical of the Acanthophora clade, including needle-like prickles and simple hairs on the upper leaf surfaces.",

Erythrotrichum (Whalen) Child, which included S. accrescens, S. megalonyx, S. paludosum, and S. robustum, and Whalen's (1984) S. erythrotrichum species group, which included S. accrescens, S. decompositiflorum, S. decorum, S. megalonyx, and S. robustum. Whalen (1984) did not include S. paludosum, S. reflexiflorum, and S. rhytidoandrum in his treatment, while Nee (1999 ) did not treat S. decorum, S. decompositiflorum, S. reflexiflorum, and S. rhytidoandrum. In more recent treatments, Agra (2004 , 2008 listed all of these species as members of sect. Erythrotrichum except S. reflexiflorum, which she left as a species of uncertain placement; however, S. robustum was not included in her revision of sect. Erythrotrichum (Agra, 2004) or her key to the section (Agra, 2008). The Erythrotrichum clade also includes S. absconditum and S. jabrense that were described by Agra (2004 Agra ( , 2008 after the publications of Whalen (1984) and Nee (1999) and considered by her to belong to sect. Erythrotrichum. Levin & al. (2006) sampled three species from the Erythrotrichum clade (S. accrescens, S. robustum, S. stagnale) and found them to form a well-supported monophyletic group included within their Robustum clade. Our increased sampling, now encompassing 9 of the 22 species included in sect. Erythrotrichum by Agra (2008), reveals that they all form a wellsupported monophyletic group that also includes S. hexandrum, S. reflexiflorum, S. robustum, and S. stagnale that Agra (2008) did not treat. Solanum hexandrum and S. stagnale have not been included in sect. Erythrotrichum by previous authors. Whalen (1984) and Nee (1999) included both species in the S. polytrichum species group and sect. Polytrichum, respectively; Agra (2007) included S. hexandrum in sect. Polytrichum but left S. stagnale unplaced. According to our results, these species clearly belong to the Erythrotrichum clade. Within the Erythrotrichum clade, S. hexandrum, S. robustum, and S. stagnale form a monophyletic group, but with poor bootstrap support. The three species are morphologically similar, with large decurrent leaf blades and accrescent fruiting calyces. Solanum reflexiflorum was not treated by Whalen (1984) or Nee (1999) , and Agra (2007) left it unplaced. This species, endemic to the state of Bahia, Brazil, has reduced infloresences, small flowers with reflexed calyx lobes, and glabrous fruits, but is evidently a member of the Erythrotrichum clade according to molecular data.",

(2006) obtained this same result in their broader study of the spiny solanums; S. stenandrum and S. agrarium did not belong to the Acanthophora clade, but instead formed a well-supported group with S. microphyllum that was included as part of their Robustum clade. With our increased taxonomic sampling, we now recognize three clades, the Erythrotrichum, Thomasiifolium, and Gardneri clades, within the Robustum clade of Levin & al. (2006) .",

Solanum schomburghii and S. gardneri have similar appearances due to their dense, white stellate hairs and very long, tapering anthers. Finally, S. polytrichum is very distinctive due to its long, bristly pubescence and the prickly calyces that nearly completely cover the fruit. More sampling from eastern Brazil and the Caribbean will improve our phylogenetic understanding of the Gardneri clade. However, current results are sufficient to state that neither sect. Polytrichum nor sect. Persicariae as circumscribed by Nee (1999) are monophyletic.",

These are all taxa that also were unplaced in Levin & al. (2006) . Solanum campechiense, a species from marshy areas of Central America, the Caribbean, and northeastern South America, continues to be an enigmatic species. Its sequences are highly divergent and it has distinctive morphological characteristics including a sprawling habit, abundant straight prickles, deeply lobed leaves, and green, yellow, or purplish fruits surrounded by accrescent spiny calyces. Both Nee (1999) and Whalen (1984) suggested a relationship between S. campechiense and S. sisymbriifolium, but this relationship is not supported by our data. Solanum crotonoides is known only from montane forests of Hispaniola and is unusual in the spiny solanums in its dioecious reproductive system and strongly discolorous leaves due to almost lepidote pubescence on the abaxial surfaces. Nee (1999) placed S. crotonoides in sect. Persicariae, which is clearly not monophyletic (see discussion under Gardneri clade). Whalen (1984) placed S. crotonoides in the S. crotonoides species group along with three other species from the Caribbean, none of which were sampled in this study. Sampling these and other Caribbean species is key for understanding its phylogenetic affinities. As in Levin & al. (2006) , S. hieronymi is supported as sister to the Elaeagnifolium + Old World clades. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay and has morphological similarities with the Elaeagnifolium clade, including a rhizomatous, herbaceous habit, needle-like spines, and a densely, spiny accrescent calyx. Finally, S. multispinum also remains unplaced. It is found in Argentina, Paraguay, and adjacent regions of Brazil and is a small, rhizomatous herb with abundant needle-like prickles, an andromonoecious reproductive system, and mottled, yellowgreen fruits. Its morphology and distribution point to it being related to members of the Carolinense clade; however, molecular data are, at present, inconclusive as to its relationships.",

In many cases, these clades are defined by unique morphological features and/ or geographical ranges. Future studies are underway to resolve some of the remaining polytomies and ambiguously placed taxa using newly developed COSII markers (Wu & al., 2006; Rodriguez & al., 2009) and additional chloroplast markers (Shaw & al., 2007; Miller & al., 2009) . Further taxonomic sampling, particularly from Brazilian and Caribbean species, is likely to identify new clades within the spiny solanums and clarify relationships within the Asterophorum, Gardneri, Thomasiifolium, and Erythrotrichum clades. More detailed studies of specific clades, particularly the Old World clade and S. crinitum species group, are in progress using much greater sampling density than that reported here. These molecular analyses, in concert with morphological studies, should lead us in the near future to a detailed understanding of evolutionary relationships in the large, complex, and widely distributed Leptostemonum clade.",
