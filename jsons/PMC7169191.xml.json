Bird and swine influenza viruses continuously obtain new gene segments through reassortment with human strains. Moreover, infections by multidrug\u2010resistant Gram\u2010negative bacteria are also increasing worldwide. Hence, action is needed to curtail the dissemination of these organisms. For this position paper, members of the Asian Pacific Society of Respirology (APSR) Respiratory Infections Assembly selected respiratory pathogens that are most likely to pose significant threats to humans, particularly in the Asia\u2010Pacific region. The members reviewed epidemiological features of the pathogens and put together a consensus opinion. The recommendations presented here are, in essence, expert opinion based on case reports or serious outbreaks that may not represent a high level of evidence.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the predominant influenza viruses in Asia, Europe, America and Africa were A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B during the 2015\u20132016 season.2 In East Asia, the predominant circulating virus was A(H1N1)pdm09 in the first half of the season, followed by influenza B virus in the second half of the season.2\n",
