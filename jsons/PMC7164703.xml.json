Among the sample, 3 participants experienced one potential symptom of COVID-19 which were a productive cough (n = 2) and a dry cough (n = 1). However, the participants who listed productive cough as a symptom said that the cough preceded the COVID-19 pandemic. Four participants sought SARS-CoV-2 testing, but interestingly none of the participants who reported symptoms were those who sought testing. Three of those who sought testing received a test. Two tested negative and 1 participant was awaiting results. The participant who was unable to receive testing indicated that it was due to being unaware that an appointment was necessary to receive a test. These findings could highlight potential barriers in educating older PLWH in COVID-19 symptoms and testing; particularly as it pertains to (1) identifying symptoms of COVID-19, (2) knowing who should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, (3) the appropriate protocol to procure a test depending on location (i.e. drive through testing vs appointment driven testing).",

One participant did report not being able to get a SARS-CoV-2 test because they did not have an appointment. It is unclear why this was the case. Clinics should prioritize certain vulnerable populations such as older PLWH for testing, or perhaps provide testing during a routine care visit if available. Stress levels do seem to be impacted by COVID-19, and for our participants, stress revolved around its impact on their health, on their sense of social isolation, and their economic situation. For example, one participant asked if they could receive the study incentive even if the trial was suspended. Researchers should consider how suspension of studies may financially affect their target population. We did not ask about social isolation directly; however, anecdotally, our research interviewer has observed how happy our participants are to receive his phone calls and to talk to someone. One participant was so grateful, he states, she cried during the phone call. Social isolation and mental health should be assessed and addressed during such a crisis event.",

However, these guidelines seem to be geared mostly towards resource limited scenarios such as absence of electricity, potable water, and/or shelter. New guidelines should be constructed that address HIV care during epidemics which typically occur in the presence of necessary resources. Our findings imply the need for future guidelines to include the following information: when should clinics begin using telehealth methods to maintain client appointments?; how often should HIV providers check in with their clients, and should check-ins include mental health assessments?; what else can researchers do to help participants get through difficult periods of uncertainty?; and what actions can researchers take to educate their participants on emerging pandemics?",

In sum, weekly phone calls can help researchers maintain contact with participants and provides an option for further data collection. We also believe that our weekly phone calls to all our participants are helping them stay connected and puts us in a position to help them in the case an emergency arises.",
