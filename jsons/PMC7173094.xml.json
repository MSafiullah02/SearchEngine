Innate immune responses can be mounted by virtually all nucleated cells in the body and are critical for anti-microbial defense [1], [2]. Besides being crucial in various non-immune cells, the innate responses are particularly developed in several key innate immune cells from myeloid origin (such as monocytes, macrophages (M\u03a6), dendritic cells (DC), mast cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils), and natural killer cells from lymphoid origin [1], [2]. The innate response is mounted very rapidly (within hours) and lasts for about four days until the adaptive response by T and B cells is engaged. This innate response is critical for initial survival and controlling infection until the slower but specific adaptive response has been mounted. Moreover, innate immune cells create a cytokine milieu which facilitates the activation of the adaptive response [3]. The innate immune compartment includes various biologically important sensors and effector components to detect and limit microbial infection, respectively [4]. The importance of these systems for microbial control is underpinned by the fact that almost all currently circulating pathogens have developed multiple strategies to circumvent these cellular recognition and innate immunity branches [5].",

These proteins derive their name from their common N-terminal tripartite RBCC motif consisting of a RING domain, one or two BBox domains and a coiled-coil domain. Based on their variable C-terminal domains, they have been classified into eleven different sub-groups (Fig. 1b). In line with important functions in immune regulation, many TRIMs have been reported to be interferon (IFN)-inducible (Fig. 2\n) [26], [29]. Moreover, a substantial number of TRIM genes are organized in gene clusters, of which especially the short arm of chromosome 6 stands out to harbor an array of recognized antiviral and immune-regulatory TRIMs (Fig. 2).",

The best studied antiviral TRIM, is the alpha isoform of TRIM5, which has been under heavy positive selection pressure [30]. Functional studies have shown that TRIM5\u03b1 can directly target components of retro- and lentiviral life cycles to confer antiviral effects by ubiquitin-dependent and -independent means [31], [32], [33], [34], and may confer species-specific restriction. For example, while human TRIM5\u03b1 restricts murine leukemia virus infection, it does not prevent HIV-1 infection [35]. In contrast, Old World monkey TRIM5\u03b1 restricts infection with HIV-1, while being ineffective against infection with its simian counterpart SIV [36], [37]. In addition, to restriction of retroviruses, several other TRIMs have been reported to confer antiviral activity against members of most major virus families [38]. However, as recently discussed the biological relevance of some of these overexpression-based studies will need to be established in vivo\n[39].",

These data suggest that the pool of functional TRIM protein forms may be 2\u20133 times larger than the mere number of TRIM genes. Moreover, it indicates that the TRIM family is seemingly more defined by having at least a partial RBCC in combination with one of the eleven C-terminal domain constellations. Also functionally, various \u201cTRIM-like\u201d members have reported immune regulatory functions similar to their full-RBCC relatives (discussed below).

Although mutations in TRIM BBoxes have been associated with auto-immune diseases in humans, very little is known about their structural and functional roles in cellular regulation. As a result of the high resemblance of BBoxes to RING domains, it has been suggested that BBoxes could in some TRIMs provide an E2 binding site similar to RINGs and thereby confer E3 ligase activity to RINGless TRIMs. In support of this notion, recent work demonstrated that RINGless TRIM16 confers ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in vitro\n[42]. In addition to this ubiquitin-dependent function, ubiquitin-independent functions have been described for TRIM BBoxes, such as for TRIM20 to keep the ASC inflammasome adaptor in an auto-inhibited state [43], and for TRIM14 where it may fulfill an scaffolding role in MAVS-mediated signaling [44].",

In fact, plotting of the TRIM gene numbers in species representing various stages of eukaryotic evolution suggests that the increases in TRIM genes shows several similarities with the rapid evolution of the IFN system (Fig. 3). One example of these similarities is the expansion of the ancestors of the IFN regulatory factors (IRF) -which in vertebrates drive the transcription of IFNs. Although ancestral IRFs were already present in early invertebrates, their number rapidly expanded and evolved under heavy positive selection from a common ancestor to the jawed vertebrates similar to TRIMs (Fig. 3) [55].",

So far there is little experimental evidence linking TRIM function to the adaptive immune system, although fifteen TRIMs are highly expressed in T and/or B cells (Fig. 4\n). In fact, a subset of TRIMs has been previously shown to be highly expressed in CD4 T cells with immune-modulatory roles such as Th2 and IL10-Treg cells as compared to M\u03a6 and DCs [26]. Thus far, only a specific function has been described for TRIM27 in negative regulation of Ca2+ influx and cytokine production during TCR engagement by targeting phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase C2\u03b2 (PI3KC2\u03b2) for K48-mediated proteasomal degradation [62], and TRIM28 which in CD4 T cells by yet unknown mechanisms regulates IL2 production and cell proliferation upon TCR engagement [63].

Upon exogenous expression, many TRIMs form cytoplasmic bodies, which do not co-localize with sub-cellular markers for most-common organelles [45]. Recent work on TRIM6, which also facilitates the formation of these cytoplasmic structures, showed that unanchored poly-ubiquitin synthesized by TRIM6 is crucial for the formation of these TRIM-ubiquitin bodies (TUB) and their role in immune signaling [14]. It is tempting to speculate that these TUBs may be structures providing a sub-cellular scaffolding platform to recruit and confine TRIMs and their targets, although more studies are needed to investigate the general nature of this finding.",

In addition, different subset of TRIMs was also shown to be differentially expressed in plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) and in CD4 T cells whereas a different subset was induced in M\u03a6s and DCs by TLR stimulation and virus infection in a IFN-I dependent manner [22].

This cytokine is predominantly secreted by T helper 1 (Th1) and NK cells during infection, and activates mechanisms in macrophages critical for anti-bacterial immunity against phagocytosed bacteria. The induction of the phagosome NADPH-oxidase complex which synthesizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) are main effector functions by which IFN\u03b3 confers anti-bacterial infection[71], which is underpinned by the fact that individuals with mutations in these systems are hyper-susceptible to bacterial infections [72].",

TRIM38 was shown to interact with TRAF6 through its PRY-SPRY domain, thereby negatively regulating TRAF6 function by facilitating TRAF6 K48 poly-ubiquitination and degradation [98]. Consistent with this notion, knockdown in primary peritoneal M\u03a6s increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, whereas this was reduced by over-expression. This indicates that TRIMs can also regulate the activity of other non-TRIM ubiquitin ligases in these signaling pathways.

Mice do however express the highly homologous mouse-specific TRIM30\u03b1. Interestingly, studies using in vivo siRNA-mediated knockdown and transgenic mice overexpressing TRIM30 have demonstrated an opposite function for TRIM30 as a negative regulator of the TAB2/TAB3 complex compared to human TRIM5 [13], [100]. TRIM30 is predominantly expressed in mouse lymphoid tissues in e.g. M\u03a6 and pDCs [26]. In bone-marrow DCs it is only detectable after stimulation of TLR-signaling [100].

While Trim21\n\u2212/\u2212 MEFs derived from these mice did have an elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine signature, these responses were indistinguishable in wt and Trim21\n\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow-derived DCs and M\u03a6s [114]. In line with this finding that perhaps TRIM21 only affects cytokine induction in certain cell types like fibroblasts, cytokine induction in the brains of adenovirus infected Trim21\n\u2212/\u2212 mice was similar to wt counterparts [75]. Although differences in animal housing and pathogen exposure could account for the phenotypic differences found in these studies, it has been suggested that the strategies used to make the knockout mice in these studies differed and some of the Th17-axis inflammatory phenotype could be due to the synthesis of a truncated TRIM21 form lacking its C-terminal half [112], [113].",

A comparative study by Chae and co-workers has directly addressed the question as to whether FMF in mice is caused by loss- or gain of TRIM20 function [118]. In their experiments, Trim20\n\u2212/\u2212 mice did not have any auto-inflammatory phenotype and were phenotypically normal, whereas knock-in mice carrying TRIM20 PRY-SPRY mutations found in human FMF patients developed spontaneous inflammatory disease, which cross-ins with Il1br\n\u2212/\u2212 or Asc\n\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed was completely ASC and IL1\u03b2 dependent [118].

However, what these studies also emphasize is that the manner in which different TRIMs regulate the immune response is complex. The same TRIMs may have different, multiple or even opposite functions in different signaling pathways and some functions may be species-specific and cell type-specific. Although some studies have focused on the biological relevance of individual TRIM proteins in these primary cell types, the majority of studies have been in cell lines and/or non-immune cells. Hence, an important future effort will lay in addressing the relevance and molecular mechanism of these TRIMs in the regulation of immune signaling in primary cells and in vivo. The identification and study of biological relevance of individual TRIMs in the correct cell type is likely to be especially important considering the restricted expression of many (Fig. 4). Even in mouse studies using different Trim21 knockout alleles, discrepancies in inflammatory phenotypes have been reported, which stresses the importance of generating mice with null mutations or carefully analyzing the expression of the protein expressed from the targeted gene using antibodies which could recognize truncated peptides expressed from exons not targeted in the mouse.",

This will require mapping in specific cells of all major TRIM interaction partners, combined with the identification of key residues essential for TRIM interaction with its binding partners, and the generation of mice where specifically the interaction with the immune molecule of interest is disrupted. Especially in combination with conditional/cell type-specific targeting, such an approach could be very powerful to delineate the biological role of TRIMs for the immune response in vivo with much more resolution and less interference from potentially affecting more than one role of a multi-functional protein.",

The recent introduction of CRISPR/CAS9-based genome engineering has made the generation of endogenous TRIM genes with fluorescent tags or photoactivatable tags much more feasible. In combination with advanced live imaging techniques these approaches will enable studying the regulation in space and time of TRIM proteins under endogenous setting without the risk of artifacts arising from overexpression or the use of artificial cell types.",

After ubiquitin activation by the E1 enzyme, ubiquitin is covalently attached to an E2 conjugase through a thio-ester bond. Subsequently, the TRIM E3 ligases bind this E2 complex through their RING domain, while determining specificity by associating with the ubiquitination target often through one of its C-terminal domains. This brings the ubiquitin-loaded E2 in close proximity to the intended target, after which the ubiquitin moiety is directly transferred to a lysine residue in the target protein by an isopeptide bond. Subsequently, additional ubiquitins can be conjugated onto internal lysines in ubiquitin or its N-terminal methionine (M1). The same ubiquitin chains can also be synthesized without being covalently coupled to their targets (unanchored ubiquitin chains). (b) Overview of the domain organization of TRIM family members.",
