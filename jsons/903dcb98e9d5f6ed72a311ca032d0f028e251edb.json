These antibodies are subsequently released into the tonsillar crypt lumen. All fi ve isotypes of immunoglobulins are produced in the tonsil.

Furthermore, with a few rare exceptions (e.g. Arcanobacterium haemolyticum , Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium spp.) anti-microbial treatment is not benefi cial for bacterial causes of tonsillitis except GABHS given that there is not a signifi cant reduction in the rate of complications or in duration of clinical symptoms [ 7 ] . Seventy percent of patients presenting with sore throat are treated with antibiotics while only 20-30 % have documented GABHS tonsillitis. Antibiotic treatment may be associated with adverse drug events that range from mild diarrhea to severe allergic reactions. Thus, the utility of these drugs must be determined in order to avoid potential selection of resistant organisms, exposure to adverse events associated with anti-microbial use, and extra cost. Treatment of GABHS is instrumental in preventing the potentially long-term and life-threatening complications associated with this pathogen, specifi cally and most importantly, ARF. Treatment also aids in the control of acute signs and symptoms, prevention of suppurative complications, and decreased transmission of GABHS to close contacts [ 7 ] . Throat pain and fever self-resolve by 1 week and 3-5 days, respectively, after onset if left untreated; if treated, both symptoms resolve within 3 days [ 15 ] . The organisms are eradicated from the pharynx after 10 days of treatment. ARF can be prevented even if therapy is initiated after 9 days of onset [ 11 ] .

            "text": "One of the most commonly used in-offi ce diagnostic tests for GABHS is the Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT). This test is done via throat swab of the surface of either tonsil or tonsillar fossa and posterior pharyngeal wall. Swabs of other areas of the oropharynx or oral cavity may lead to false negatives. An enzyme immunoassay test with turn-around times as little as 5 min is then done. It is 95 % specifi c and 70-90 % sensitive based on the type or manufacturer of RADT used. In the case of a positive RADT, children should be treated with antibiotics. In the case of a negative RADT, the IDSA recommends a throat culture be done during the same offi ce visit. Due to the variability in sensitivity of RDTA based on manufacturer, the high rate of GABHS in children and implications of complications, a throat culture is recommended in order to capture any false negatives. The rapid turnaround time for RADT makes it useful for rapid identifi cation and treatment of GABHS. Rapid treatment decreases the risk of spread of GABHS among close contacts, the amount of time missed from school or work for caregivers, and the duration and severity of acute signs and symptoms of GABHS tonsillitis [ 7 ] .",

A single throat swab has a 90-95 % sensitivity rate when done correctly. A throat swab similar to the RADT test is done and is then either processed in an in-offi ce laboratory or sent to a microbiology laboratory. If the cultures are grown in-offi ce, specifi c instructions must be followed. The swab is processed on a sheep's blood agar plate and incubated at 35-37 \u00b0C for 18-24 h. While treatment decisions can be made based on growth patterns at 24 h, a plate with no growth should be re-examined at 48 h to ensure a correct diagnosis. Two major disadvantages of using throat cultures for diagnostic purposes are the training and cost associated with accurate testing as well as delayed diagnosis due to processing time. However, even a delayed diagnosis can be benefi cial. Studies show that treatment of GABHS tonsillitis can be delayed up to 9 days from the onset of symptoms and still effectively prevent complications such as ARF [ 7 , 16 , 17 ] . Therefore, regardless of the delay in treatment, throat cultures should be done in children with negative RADT [ 7 ] .",
