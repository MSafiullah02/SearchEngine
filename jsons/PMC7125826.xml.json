            "text": "Centromeres (also termed kinetochores) are of fundamental importance to chromosomal inheritance in all eukaryotes (reviewed byPluta et al. 1995). These functionally differentiated structures on eukaryotic chromosomes consist of specific centromere DNA sequences and associated proteins that facilitate binding to the spindle microtubules. Kinetochores mediate chromosome movement to ensure the ordered segregation of sister chromatids into daughter cells during mitosis and meiosis. Kinetochore activity must be regulated to coordinate chromosome segregation with other events in the cell cycle and to ensure that bipolar attachment of all chromosomes is achieved before anaphase begins. The structural complexity of centromeres varies widely among higher and lower eukaryotes, as exemplified by the centromeres of animal cells (which span several thousand kilobases of DNA) and budding yeast (which span <0.2 kb of DNA). Despite these apparent organizational differences, centromeres in higher and lower eukaryotes are likely to share evolutionarily conserved components.",

            "text": "The structurally compact centromere of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been analyzed extensively using molecular genetic techniques (reviewed byHegemann and Fleig 1993). The centromere DNA sequence encompasses a 125 bp region that includes three conserved elements, termed CDEI, CDEII, and CDEIII (12, 20). CDEIII (25 bp) is absolutely essential, as evidenced by single point mutations that destroy centromere activity (Hegemann et al. 1988). Lechner and Carbon 1991 described the purification of a 240 kDa multicomponent protein complex, termed CBF3, that specifically binds CDEIII sequences in vitro. The CBF3 complex has three major components that are 110, 64, and 58 kDa in size. The genes encoding p110 (NDC10/CBF2/CTF14) (15, 24, 8), p64 (CEP3/CBF3b) (Strunnikov et al. 1995; Lechner 1994), and p58 (CTF13) (Doheny et al. 1993) have been cloned and characterized. All three proteins are essential for viability, and mutations in any one of them cause a chromosome missegregation phenotype, consistent with a role in kinetochore function. At nonpermissive temperature, the ndc10-1 mutation causes asymmetric segregation of chromosomes in which all chromosomes segregate to one pole following nuclear division. Temperature-sensitive mutations in ctf13 or cep3/cbf3c exhibit G2/M accumulation at nonpermissive temperature with preanaphase short mitotic spindles. Cep3p contains a predicted zinc finger and may therefore represent a DNA-binding component. Ndc10p contains a GTP-binding motif. None of the three CBF3 proteins described to date exhibits extensive homology to any known proteins in the databases.",

            "text": "The coordination of centromere function with cell cycle progression is likely to require regulation of kinetochore protein activity and a signal transduction system that monitors completion of chromosome attachment and relays the status of events to the cell cycle machinery. A direct role for the kinetochore in a checkpoint that monitors completion of metaphase is suggested by studies in both animal and yeast cells. Microinjection of anti\u2013centromere protein antibodies into cultured human cells induces mitotic delay (Bernat et al. 1990). In cultured mammalian cells, the onset of anaphase following nuclear envelope breakdown is delayed even when only a single kinetochore is not attached to microtubules (Rieder et al. 1994). Laser ablation of the unattached kinetochore destroys the delay in anaphase onset, suggesting an inhibitory effect of the unattached kinetochore in cell cycle progression. In yeast cells, a preanaphase delay is induced by the presence of a single mutant centromere DNA (Spencer and Hieter 1992) or by hypomorphic mutations in kinetochore proteins (Doheny et al. 1993). Recently, three groups have presented evidence that the preanaphase delay induced by abnormal kinetochore function requires genes that are involved in a mitotic checkpoint\u2013monitoring spindle assembly (48, 49, 37). Very little is currently known about the molecular components or mechanism that signals defects in kinetochore structure to cell cycle regulators.",

Given this complexity, additional structural and regulatory components must be identified to gain a complete understanding of kinetochore function. To accomplish this, we have employed a variety of genetic screens in S. cerevisiae using ctf13-30, a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding p58 of CBF3, as a starting point. In this paper, we describe the identification of the SKP1 gene as a dosage suppressor of a ctf13-30 mutant. Genetic and biochemical analysis indicates that the 22.3 kDa Skp1 protein is a fourth subunit of CBF3 that was previously unrecognized. Unlike the other CBF3 components, Skp1p is a highly conserved protein found in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, Skp1p has recently been shown to be a component of a cyclin A\u2013cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complex purified from transformed human fibroblasts (Zhang et al. 1995) and to interact directly with Cdc4p and cyclin F through a novel structural motif (Bai et al., 1996 [this issue of Cell]). We conclude that Skp1p is involved in both structural and regulatory functions and may provide a direct link between the kinetochore and the cell cycle machinery.",

A 2\u03bc genomic library was transformed into a ctf13-30 mutant, and temperature-resistant transformants were selected (see Experimental Procedures). We obtained 12 plasmid clones that fell into two classes of overlapping genomic segments: 7 of 12 corresponded to the CTF13 gene; 5 of 12 contained a new locus. We named the locus SKP1, for suppressor of kinetochore protein 1. In addition to dosage suppression of the temperature sensitivity for growth, increased dosage of SKP1 suppressed the chromosome missegregation phenotype caused by the ctf13-30 mutation at semi-permissive temperature, even when SKP1 was introduced at a modestly increased copy number on a centromere vector (data not shown). Insertion of a DNA fragment containing a prototrophic marker into a unique NsiI site disrupted the ability of the genomic plasmid clone to suppress the temperature-sensitive and chromosome missegregation phenotypes of a ctf13-30 mutant. When the gene disruption was integrated into the genome, dissection of a heterozygous diploid resulted in viability segregating 2+:2\u2212 (see Experimental Procedures). The genomic clone was localized to the right arm of chromosome IV using physical mapping methods, indicating that SKP1 is a previously unidentified essential gene in S. cerevisiae.",

Because of the small size of Skp1p, it was possible that it represented a previously unrecognized subunit of CBF3. To determine whether this was the case, we made two epitope-tagged constructs of Skp1p (see Experimental Procedures). In the first, two tandem copies of the E1 epitope (Pluta et al. 1992), derived from the carboxy-terminal 25 amino acids of avian coronavirus glycoprotein (Machamer and Rose 1987), were placed in-frame at the amino terminus of the SKP1 ORF under the transcriptional control of the GAL1 promoter (Figure 1C). In the second construct, a 9 amino acid epitope derived from the HA1 protein of influenza virus (Field et al. 1988) was placed in-frame at the amino terminus of the SKP1 ORF under the control of the ADH2 promoter (Figure 1C).

DNA\u2013protein complexes were allowed to form with 32P-labeled CDEIII sequence, and complexes were resolved on a nondenaturing gel (Figure 2). In the absence of anti-E1 antibody, extracts containing the E1 epitope\u2013tagged fusions of Ctf13p and Skp1p show a slight (but clearly observable and reproducible) intrinsic mobility shift up when compared with wild-type and untagged extracts (Figure 2A, lanes 2\u20136), suggesting that the E1\u2013Skp1p fusion protein is localized to the complex. The magnitude of the intrinsic shift is identical for E1-tagged Ctf13p and E1-tagged Skp1p, indicating equal stoichiometry of these two proteins in the CBF3 complex. When E1 antibody is added to complexes formed using extracts from tagged and untagged Ctf13p and Skp1p strains, a supershift is observed using the Ctf13p-tagged extract (Figure 2A, lane 8) and the E1-tagged Skp1p extract, although the supershift with E1-tagged Skp1p was less pronounced (Figure 2A, lane 10). These results suggested that Skp1p is in the CBF3 complex, as evidenced by both the intrinsic and antibody-induced mobility shift; however, epitope accessibility or antibody binding stability could have compromised a supershift equivalent to that seen with epitope-tagged Ctf13p.\n",

By this criterion, the strains fell into two classes. Strains expressing the skp1-1, skp1-2, or skp1-3 alleles exhibited wild-type rates of chromosome missegregation. The strain expressing skp1-4, however, exhibited a dramatically increased rate of chromosome missegregation comparable with that observed for the ctf13-30 mutant. We therefore decided to analyze further strains carrying one mutation in each class (skp1-3 and skp1-4). Our approach was to integrate each mutant allele as a single copy into the genome to avoid potential plasmid copy number effects. Both the skp1-3 and skp1-4 alleles contain single missense mutations (Ile-172 to Asn and Leu-146 to Ser, respectively; Figure 1D).

First, as observed with the plasmid-borne alleles, skp1-3 does not cause increased chromosome missegregation, while skp1-4 causes a dramatic increase in chromosome missegregation (Figure 3, skp1 mutants transformed with vector only). Chromosome transmission fidelity was quantitated in a skp1-4/skp1-4 homozygous diploid using colony color half sector analysis (Koshland and Hieter 1987). The rates of chromosome loss (1:0 segregation) and chromosome nondisjunction (2:0 segregation) in the skp1-4 mutant were 3.9% and 1.7% per cell division, respectively, which represent greater than 100-fold increases relative to wild type. Second, because SKP1 was identified as a high copy suppressor of ctf13-30, it was of interest to test the reciprocal relationship, i.e., whether Ctf13p overexpression could suppress the skp1 temperature-sensitive alleles. Overexpression of Ctf13p rescues the temperature sensitivity of skp1-4, but not that of skp1-3 (data not shown). In addition, at semi-permissive temperature, the chromosome missegregation phenotype caused by the skp1-4 mutation is suppressed by increased dosage of Ctf13p, even when present at one or a few extra copies on a centromere vector (Figure 3). This suppression is kinetochore protein gene specific, since increased dosage of Ndc10p has no effect, suggesting a direct interaction between the Skp1 and Ctf13 proteins. Third, following a 3 hr shift to nonpermissive temperature, skp1-3 causes haploid cells to arrest with a G1 DNA content, while skp1-4 causes haploid cells to arrest with a G2 DNA content (data not shown). These terminal phenotypes were more fully characterized in diploids (see below). Fourth, skp1-3 and skp1-4 mutations exhibit interallelic complementation. Heterozygous and homozygous diploids were created from meiotic segregants of each of the integrated temperature-sensitive alleles. At nonpermissive temperature (37\u00b0C), the skp1-3/skp1-4 heteroallelic diploid forms colonies, whereas either homozygous mutant diploid does not. Furthermore, at permissive temperature (25\u00b0C), the skp1-3 allele complements the chromosome segregation defect of the skp1-4 allele in the heteroallelic diploid.\n",

A novel class of cells with abnormally elongated buds (21%) is also seen (Figure 4B and Figure 5). After 6 hr at nonpermissive temperature, 57% of skp1-3 cells exhibit novel cell morphologies, including a multiple budded phenotype accounting for 37% of the cell population. It appears that skp1-3 cells do not replicate their DNA (arrest with a G1 DNA content), but continue the budding process. This arrest phenotype is analogous to that seen in a class of cdc mutants typified by cdc4. In contrast, skp1-4 cells arrest with a predominant cell morphology indicative of the preanaphase G2/M phase of the cell cycle. After 3 hr at the nonpermissive temperature, 48% of cells were large budded with an undivided nucleus positioned at or near the neck between mother and daughter cells. The majority of cells with this morphology were characterized by DNA at or spanning the neck and a short mitotic spindle. Cells with a short spindle spanning the neck accounted for 16% of the cell population, a morphology rarely seen (<1%) in wild-type cells. Interestingly, at 6 hr a proportion of cells (11%) exhibited a novel multiple budded phenotype (Figure 4B and Figure 5). The skp1-4 terminal arrest morphology phenotype is therefore like that of cdc (at medial nuclear division) and is quite similar to that caused by mutations in the 64 kDa (Cep3p) and 58 kDa (Ctf13p) subunits of CBF3.\n",

Clones corresponding to the EST sequences were obtained in each case, and the complete sequences of the Skp1p homologs in these three organisms were determined. The human Skp1p homolog sequence is identical to the sequence of p19 (Zhang et al. 1995), which is a component of a cyclin A\u2013CDK2 complex purified from transformed human fibroblasts. Coincidentally, the gene encoding human p19 was also named SKP1 (for S phase kinase-associated protein). In addition, a search of the nonredundant protein database (NRDB) revealed three sequences with high similarity to Skp1p: OCP-II (Chen et al. 1995), FP21 (West et al. 1995), and an unknown ORF (Lu et al. 1995). OCP-II is a protein found in the organ of Corti in the guinea pig inner ear, and its role in auditory function is unknown. FP21 is a glycoprotein of unknown function in Dictyostelium and appears to have an unusual glycosylation site. The third match is to a predicted 19 kDa protein that corresponds to an ORF of unknown function encoded in the chlorella virus PBCV-1 genome.

Second, SKP1 is an essential gene, and the temperature-sensitive mutation skp1-4 causes phenotypes similar to those observed in a ctf13 mutant, including chromosome missegregation at semi-permissive temperature and a terminal phenotype at nonpermissive temperature indicative of a defect in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.

The intrinsic mobility shift data (Figure 2A) indicate that Skp1p and Ctf13p are present at an equimolar ratio. Addition of a 60 amino acid segment to either Skp1p or Ctf13p results in an identical mobility change for the CBF3\u2013CEN DNA complex in the absence of added anti-epitope antibody. Exact comigration of these complexes has been confirmed in extended electrophoresis runs (data not shown). This \u201cintrinsic\u201d shift is not subject to variation of epitope accessibility to antibody binding, as might be encountered in a standard supershift assay (as in Figure 2B). CBF3 therefore contains a minimum of four subunits, which are likely to be in an equimolar ratio. The DNase I footprint of CBF3 exhibits asymmetry around the center of the dyad and encompasses 56 bp of DNA (Jehn et al. 1991). It is possible that multiple CBF3 complexes bind to a single CDEIII sequence, especially given the dyad symmetry within the 25 bp CDEIII consensus sequence.",

The human SKP1 is likely encoded at a single locus, since all 20 examples of SKP1-related human EST sequences in dbEST appear to represent overlapping segments of a single mRNA species. Recently, a mouse gene encoding a Skp1p homolog was cloned and related sequences were mapped to two locations in the mouse genome, one corresponding to the cloned gene and the other to a cross-hybridizing sequence (Chen et al. 1995). It is possible that one of these represents a pseudogene, although this point needs clarification. In C. elegans, however, SKP1-related ESTs were derived from two nonidentical mRNA sequences (only one of which was sequenced to completion and reported here). The human genome may therefore contain a single functional SKP1 gene or, alternatively, two functional genes, one of which is expressed at low levels and not represented in the cDNA libraries used for EST sequencing. Skp1p homologs present in the public databases include OCP-II (Cavia porcellus), FP21 (Dictyostelium discoideum), and an uncharacterized ORF from the chlorella virus (PBCV-1) genome; however, very little is known about the function of these three proteins in their respective organisms. The human Skp1p homolog protein sequence is identical to a sequence reported by Zhang et al. 1995 for p19SKP1, a protein that copurifies with a p9\u2013p45SKP2\u2013cyclin A\u2013CDK2 complex derived from transformed fibroblasts. Although addition of p45 or p45 and p19 to cyclin A\u2013CDK2 complexes had no effect on kinase activity in vitro, microinjection of anti-p45 antibody into cultured cells prevented entry into S phase. Microinjection of anti-p19 antibody had no effect, so there is currently no direct evidence that p19SKP1 modulates CDK activity either in vitro or in vivo. The G1/S arrest observed in S. cerevisiae skp1-3 mutants reported here supports the hypothesis that p19 is an essential element of the cyclin A\u2013CDK2 S phase kinase.",

This is reminiscent of allele-specific G1 or G2/M arrest points caused by different cdc28 mutant alleles (seeNasmyth 1993). The G2/M accumulation and chromosome missegregation phenotypes in skp1-4 mutants are similar to those observed in ctf13 and cep3/cbf3c mutants, both of which carry mutations in CBF3 components. The G2/M delay in cell cycle progression could be due to a physical impediment to chromosome separation or, alternatively, to activation of a cell cycle checkpoint. The identification of mad and bub mutants that bypass a cell cycle arrest induced by defects in spindle assembly provides strong evidence for a surveillance mechanism that monitors spindle integrity in yeast (21, 28). Two groups have recently shown that these same functions are required for the G2/M delay observed in response to kinetochore defects caused by mutations in ctf13 or CEN DNA (48, 37). It will therefore be of interest to determine the effects of mad and bub mutants on the skp1-4-mediated G2/M delay.",

It is known, for example, that centromeres are the earliest-replicating sequences on yeast chromosomes (Ferguson and Fangman 1992).

The presence of Skp1p at the kinetochore could provide a direct molecular link to protein complexes (e.g., cyclin\u2013CDKs or other regulatory complexes) whose activities are critical to the metaphase/anaphase transition. Analysis in yeast and higher eukaryotes has provided strong evidence that kinetochores act dynamically to regulate cell cycle progression through mitosis (reviewed byGorbsky 1995). A phospho-epitope in animal cells that is present on unattached kinetochores but is extinguished when bipolar attachment is achieved may be a component or target of a kinetochore checkpoint (Campbell and Gorbsky 1995). As suggested previously (29, 16), eventual achievement of bipolar attachment could, through mechanical tension on the kinetochore complex, induce a conformational change in a key regulatory protein and thereby regulate the activity of an associated kinase. Though speculative, it is possible that Skp1p may function at the kinetochore to signal completion of metaphase. For example, Skp1p could facilitate docking of a cyclin\u2013CDK complex (or proteins involved in regulating a kinase) at the kinetochore. This specific localization of a regulatory kinase (or other protein complex) may act as a determinant in its activity upon a kinetochore-localized substrate. Perhaps the regulatory capacity of Skp1p has been recruited to the kinetochore by its direct incorporation within the CBF3\u2013CEN DNA complex.",

Fill-in of a unique NsiI site with T4DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) abolished the suppressing activity. A series of subclones and deletion derivatives were sequenced by standard methods (42, 17, 44, 32). CEN vector derivatives containing the 1.68 kb SpeI\u2013PvuII region were constructed by insertion into the SpeI and SmaI polylinker sites of pRS vectors (Sikorski and Hieter 1989), resulting in two constructs, pRS315SKP and pRS316SKP. These CEN vector recombinants were able to suppress the temperature sensitivity of ctf13-30, but not to the extent of the 2\u03bc library clone 3B. Insertion into the SKP1 ORF of a 1.8 kb BglII fragment containing the TRP1 gene was accomplished by blunt-end ligation into the NsiI site. One-step gene replacement was accomplished by excision of a NotI\u2013XhoI fragment and transformation into YPH985 selecting for Trp+ transformants. The integration of the TRP1 marker into the genome was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of restricted genomic DNA. Trp+ diploids were sporulated, and 20 tetrads dissected resulted in 2+:2\u2212 segregation for viability. All viable spores were Trp\u2212, demonstrating that SKP1 was an essential gene.",

A PCR strategy was used to place the E1 epitope in-frame with the second codon of the SKP1 ORF using an engineered XhoI cloning site and a downstream genomic EcoRI site (see Figure 1A). To avoid possible PCR errors, wild-type genomic sequence from NsiI to PvuII replaced the PCR-generated sequence. When transformed into the skp1 deletion strain, p415GEU1SKP rescued growth on galactose-containing, but not dextrose-containing, media. The untagged construct was prepared by cloning the XhoI\u2013PvuII fragment from p415GEU1SKP into p415GEU2 (J. Kroll, unpublished data) at the XhoI\u2013SmaI sites in the polylinker.

Approximately 10 ng of template was amplified under standard PCR conditions (Perkin Elmer) except the concentration of MgCl2 was increased to 3 mM and the dNTP pool was reduced to 60 \u03bcM. Approximately 500 ng of mutagenized PCR product was cotransformed into YPH1099 with 500 ng of XhoI-linearized pRS315 and 5 \u03bcg of herring sperm DNA (Sigma). Transformants were replica plated twice to medium containing FOA to ensure eviction of pRS316SKP. Of the 1300 transformants screened by this method, 16% failed to grow on FOA, suggesting knockouts of SKP1 or reclosing of the gapped vector. There was an approximately 4-fold stimulation of transformants with the addition of PCR product as compared with gapped vector only. It was also observed that approximately 80% of the gapped vector only transformants failed to grow on FOA. Transformants that grew presumably recombined with pRS316SKP. The transformants were then replica plated in parallel and grown at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. Four temperature-sensitive alleles, skp1-1, skp1-2, skp1-3, and skp1-4, were isolated, and the mutagenized plasmids were recovered and retested for sensitivity at 37\u00b0C. The nucleotide sequence of each allele was done to identify the mutations (44, 32), and an alignment of the sequences revealed that the mutations fell mostly in the carboxyl terminus (see Table 1).",

Fortunately, a genomic NsiI site was at the junction. This region of nonhomology was removed from the SKP1-coding region by a PCR strategy using a synthetic oligonucleotide, PH139, which included a unique NsiI cloning site in-frame with the sequence 5\u2032-GGTGACGACGACGATGAGGATG-3\u2032 located at the end of the 28 amino acid region to be removed. An \u223c980 bp PCR product generated from PH139 and a primer in the vector sequence of pRS316SKP was restricted with NsiI\u2013XhoI and cloned into the NsiI (genomic)\u2013Xho (polylinker) of pRS315SKP, resulting in pRS315 skp1-\u03942.
