In this study, we evaluate the impact of the metropolitan-wide quarantine on the trend 39 and transmission route of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China. The intervention reduces 40 more than 70% of new infections in both households and the public space, as well as the 41 deaths caused by COVID-19 pneumonia. Household transmission is the dominant route of 42 disease spread regardless of quarantine. This will provide important evidence and scientific 43 insights to other worldwide countries that are currently under quarantine. 44 45 Keywords.

Household contacts are often without preventive measures and 132 prone to superspreading. It is estimated an average of 5.3 cases may subsequently be infected 133 if there is a single seeding case in the household [10]. Prevention of household transmission 134 is difficult, especially when infected individuals are in the latent period or habor an 135 asymptomatic infection. Regular cleaning with disinfectants and active screening of 136 household members may help to prevent the infection and facilitate early diagnosis.",

As of 8 th 69 April 2020, more than 200 countries worldwide have reported over 1.35 million confirmed 70 cases and 79,000 deaths [2].

The quarantine has substantially reduced social contacts in the public 78 space but increased contacts in households. The quarantine lasted for eleven weeks, and 79 Wuhan, the last city of Hubei province in quarantine, was eventually resumed its economic 80 activities and public transportation on 8 th April 2020. As for now, a major intervention in the 81 first epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic has formally concluded. During this quarantine, a 82 WHO report [6] has shown that most (78-85%) of the transmissions in China had occurred in 83 a household setting. The completed cycle of quarantine-resumption of Hubei province 84 provides a unique opportunity to assess its intervention impact and the pattern of SARS-85 COV-2 transmission during the quarantine period.
