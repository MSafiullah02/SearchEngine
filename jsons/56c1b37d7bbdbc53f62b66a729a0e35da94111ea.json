            "text": "Background: COVID-19 pandemics has challenged emergency response systems worldwide, with widespread reports of essential services breakdown and collapse of health care structure. A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. Purpose: This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: A Na\u00efve-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Results: Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and other critical circumstances. Conclusions: Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.",

These algorithms can infer input-output relationships without explicitly assuming a pre-determined model [10, 11] . There are two learning paradigms: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning is a process in which the predictive models are constructed through a set of observations, each of those associated with a known outcome (label). In opposition, in unsupervised learning, one does not have access to the labels, it can be viewed as the task of \"spontaneously\" finding patterns and structures in the input data.",

A total of 510 patients (73 positives for COVID-19 and 437 negatives) presented complete data and were considered for the model construction. Classification Algorithm: In this work, we use the Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifier, which is a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. The main reasons for choosing this classifier are due to their low computational cost and clear interpretation. In medicine, the first computer-learn attempts in decision support were based mainly on the Bayes theorem, in order to aggregate data information to physicians' previous knowledge [18] . The Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) method combines the previous probability of an event (also called prior probability, or simply prior) with additional evidence (as, for example, a set of clinical data from a patient) to calculate a combined, conditional probability that includes the prior probability given the extra information. The result is the posterior probability of an outcome, or simply posterior. This classifier is called \"na\u00efve\" because it considers that each exam result (variables) is independent of each other. Once this situation is not realistic in medicine, the model should not be interpreted [23] . Besides this drawback, it can outperform more robust alternatives in classification tasks, and once it reflects the uncertainty involved in the diagnosis, Bayesian approaches are more suitable than deterministic techniques [8, 11] . Model Development and Validation: A classifier is an estimator with a predict method that takes an input array (test) and makes predictions for each sample in it. In supervised learning estimators (our case), this method returns the predicted labels or values computed from the estimated model (positive or negative for COVID -19) . Cross-validation is a model evaluation",

It consists of iteratively fitting the estimator on a fraction of the data, called training set, and testing it on the left-out unseen data, called test set. Several strategies exist to partition the data. In this work, we used the Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation model, as in Chang et al. [4] . The number of data points was split N times (number samples). The method was trained on all the data except for one point, and a prediction was made for that point. The proposed approach was implemented in Python v.3 (https://www.python.org) code using Scikit-Learn v. 0.22.2 [21] as a backend. Model Test: In order to evaluate the adequacy and generalization power of the proposed model, a set of 92 samples (10 positives for COVID-19 and 82 negatives) was extracted from the patient database. Those samples were not initially employed in model delineation, considering they present a single missing value among all 15 employed hemogram parameters. Missing data for this training set was imputed using the average value of the missing parameter within the resulting group (positive or negative). The test set was submitted to the previously generated model in order to evaluate classification performance.",

Differences are summarized in Table 1 . Regarding basophiles, eosinophils, leukocytes and platelets counts, qRT-PCR positive group distribution shows lower modal value and lower variance. On the other hand, monocyte count displays opposite behavior, once lower modal value and variance are observed for the qRT-PCR positive group. Lower variance may depict a condition pattern, therefore it is expected that negative cases present higher variance once it may contain a higher variety of conditions (reasons for symptom presence).

Reported prior probabilities refer to positive COVID-19 condition. When setting the prior probability to the maximum defined value (0.9999), the NB classifier correctly diagnosed all PCR positive cases. On the other hand, such configuration improperly predicted 77.3% of negative PCR results as positive. Regarding the lower possible prior probability setting, it does not classify a single observation as positive. This result can be explained by the unbalanced number of observations for each class, tending to over classify samples as the class with more observation, i.e. negative results. Such characteristics can also be noticed in the general accuracy, since the decrease in the prior ponce the classifier tends to diagnose all observations as belonging to the dominant class (negative) and consequently raising the total of correctly classified samples. The break-even point is met when prior probability is set to 0.2933. Under this condition, all metrics are approximately 76.6%.",

It is clear that, when extreme values of positive probability are applied (close to 0 or 1), specific classes (positive or negative qRT-PCR test results predictions) are favoured, increasing its ability of correct detection. As an example, when a value of 0.9999 is set for prior probability of positive result is set, an increase in misclassification in negative class results is observed. At the same time, it is possible to properly identify samples where hemogram evidence strongly indicates a negative result, according to the model. This is based on the fact that evidence used in the model construction (in present case, hemogram data) must strongly support the reduction of posterior probability of disease to values under 0.5, therefore leading to a negative result. This logic can be applied to fine tune the prior probability used in the model, in order to improve correct classification of positive or negative groups prediction. Examples of how to use this feature is provided in the \"Discussion\" section. Test samples (n=92, including 10 qRT-PCR positives) were used to test the proposed model. Figure 2 presents results obtained from the model application to test dataset. ",

Hemogram data have been previously proposed as useful parameters in diagnosis and management of viral pandemics [25] . In the present work, an analysis concerning hemogram data from symptomatic patients suspected of COVID-19 infection was executed. A machine learning model based on Na\u00efve Bayes method is proposed in order to predict actual qRT-PCR from such patients. The presented model can be applied to different situations, aiming to assist medical practitioners and management staff in key decisions regarding this pandemic. Figure  3 summarizes model construction and application. Predictions are not intended to be used as a diagnostic method since this technique was designed to anticipate qRT-PCR results only. As such, it is highly dependable on factors affecting qRT-PCR efficiency, and its prediction capacity is dependent on the sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity of the original laboratory exam [24] . Descriptive analysis of hemogram clinical findings shows differences in blood cell counts and other hematological parameters among COVID-19 positive and negative patient results. Differences are conspicuous among three measures (leukocytes, monocytes and platelets) and more discrete to additional two (basophiles and eosinophiles). It is possible that differences are also present across the complete data spectrum, even though they are not clearly visualized with PDF data. These results are in accordance to previous reports of changes in laboratory findings in COVID-19 infected patients, where conditions as leukopenia, lymphocytopenia and thrombopenia were reported [6] . It is important to highlight that data analysis is not sufficient to characterize clinical hematological alterations in evaluated patients (when compared to demographic hematologic parameters data), once data was normalized for the evaluated sample set only. However, even within this particular quota of population (individuals presenting COVID-19-like symptoms), differences were found between individuals presenting negative or positive qRT-PCR COVID test results. The proposed NB-ML model can be helpful in accessing different levels of information from hemogram results, through inferring non-evident patterns and parameter relationships from this data.",

Uncertainty can be then applied to adequately adapt the classifier to a particular ongoing context. This option allows the evaluation of different decision-making scenarios concerning diverse aspects of pandemics management. During a crisis situation, measures should be taken seeking to maximize benefits and achieve a fair resource allocation [5] .
