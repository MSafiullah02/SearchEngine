In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Katrin Ramsauer and colleagues4 report promising results from a randomised, phase 1, active-comparator trial assessing the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a live recombinant measles-virus-based chikungunya vaccine.",

Ramsauer and colleagues' use of the attenuated measles virus Schwarz strain is a good technique. The measles virus vaccine is one of the safest on the market and has been mass-produced at low cost in many countries since the early 1960s. The vaccine has stood the test of time and meets all the above criteria by being extremely safe and effective.5 Furthermore, measles virus is an ideal vaccine vector because it is easy to manipulate via reverse genetics, insertion of foreign sequences is well tolerated, and the resulting recombinant viruses are highly stable. 6 Being an RNA virus, replication is limited to the cytoplasm of cells, thereby increasing its safety. These properties make measles virus an obvious choice as a vaccine vector for various illnesses, such as those caused by Nipah virus, West Nile virus, respiratory syncytial virus, HIV, dengue virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n",

All doses of the candidate vaccine were effective, albeit with varying rates of seroconversion after the primary immunisation (44% in the low-dose group, 92% in the medium-dose group, and 90% in the high-dose group). However, 100% of participants had seroconverted after the second vaccination. Pre-existing antibodies against measles did not interfere with immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine10\u2014an important feature of this vaccine candidate in view of the high compliance rate for measles virus vaccination (around 84% worldwide). The safety profile of the candidate vaccine was deemed acceptable, with seven severe adverse events recorded in six patients (17% of participants receiving vaccinations). This proportion accords with the 5\u201315% of patients who develop systemic reactions after a monovalent measles vaccination. The adverse events reported included nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, headache, injection-site pain, influenza-like illness, and musculoskeletal pain. Despite the generally acceptable tolerability profile, one in six patients is a fairly concerning figure and this aspect will need to be carefully followed up in future trials.",

Strategies used for the other two vaccines differed slightly from those used in the present study. Investigators of the first study used a live-attenuated virus as a means of vaccination, whereas the investigators of the other study chose to produce a virus-like particle vaccine (VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP).11, 12 The other candidates also yielded positive results by inducing long-lasting immunity while generating few adverse effects. Unfortunately, despite entering phase 2 trials, the first vaccine fell victim to a lack of funding and marketable interest,13 and no follow-up information is available about the second candidate. Although the present phase 1 trial has only recently been published, preparations for a phase 2 trial are probably underway. Several other vaccine candidates and strategies that have yielded promising preclinical data, such as use of the picornavirus internal ribosome entry site or subunit, genetic, or recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara-based vaccines.14, 15\n",
