Postoperatively, the ECMO was withdrawn since the oxygenation had been improved and the patient's general condition was more stable. A continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started on Mar. 10 (Day 36/Day 2 postoperative) to support renal function. On Mar. 11 (Day 3 postoperative), laboratory results were: hemoglobin, 80 g/L; platelet count, 36\u00d710 9 L \u22121 ; creatinine, 103 \u03bcmol/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.77; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 45.9 s; prothrombin time (PT), 20.8 s; D-dimer, 2927.00 \u03bcg/L. On Mar. 12 at 9:00 a.m. (Day 4 postoperative), the patient developed a sudden episode of ventricular fibrillation. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation with defibrillation, sinus rhythm was restored. However, the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) gradually increased to 23.31 ng/mL. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed dynamic change of ST-segment elevation through V1 to V6 leads (Fig. 2) . Echocardiography suggested mildly reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function and segmental hypokinesia of the ventricular septum and anterior LV wall. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was diagnosed and primary PCI was performed on Mar. 13 at 7:00 p.m. (Day 5 postoperative). Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis and thrombus formation in the middle segment of left anterior descending (LAD) artery with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) Grade 3 flow, and mild to moderate stenosis in the remaining vessels. A 3.0-mm diameter by 24-mm long sirolimus-eluting stent (Partner, Lepu Medical, Beijing, China) was deployed at the LAD lesion, followed by post-dilation with a 3.25-mm diameter by 15-mm non-compliant balloon (NC Quantum, Boston Scientific, USA). Post-procedural TIMI flow was Grade 3 (Fig. 2) , and the patient's hemodynamics have remained stable since then. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily was started after intervention for 3 d. Aspirin was discontinued on the fourth day after PCI due to multiple bleeding risks. Post PCI ECG showed recovery of ST-segment, and cTnI gradually declined.",

Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related clinical studies reported multiple cases complicated with acute myocardial infarction. Researchers believed that SARS coronavirus infection may cause dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, such as elevated interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IFN-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which in turn trigger cytokine storms that cause myocardial damage and plaque instability in turn leading to myocardial infarction (Peiris et al., 2003; Tsui et al., 2005) . Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 patients also have cytokine storms caused by the imbalance of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 responses, and the levels of inflammatory factors IL-4, IL-10, and IL-6 in tissue samples were increased (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) .",

Right anterior oblique (RAO) views with cranial angulation (a) and caudal angulation (b) suggest a significant lesion in the left anterior descending artery (arrows). (e) ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation through V1 to V6 leads arteries, which affects coronary blood flow and leads to myocardial infarction, and Type 2 refers to an imbalance of myocardial blood supply/demand caused by specific factors that can lead to myocardial ischemic infarction. In our case, the angiography showed that the LAD artery was severely stenotic along with thrombus formation, but the blood flow was TIMI Grade 3. Based on the clinical characteristics of this case, we propose that the possible mechanism of myocardial infarction here included severe pulmonary infection, imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis subsequent to lung transplantation, changes in blood flow shear stress, and possible cytokine storms, which in combination led to plaque rupture in the LAD artery. Additional factors such as hypoxia and blood loss may have aggravated the ischemia. In other words, both Type 1 and Type 2 myocardial infarctions may have contributed to the patient's pathophysiological changes.",
