However, several factors have been considered. This includes microbial translocation and persistent production of early viral products such as Tat protein.27 Currently, available drugs do not impact Tat transcription from the proviral DNA. Novel approaches for treatment of HIV infection include targeting host proteins involved in viral assembly and maturation.28 However, drugs that target Tat are needed.

Some experimental evidence is available to support this approach. For example, mice treated with a combination of acyclovir and IFN\u03b1 show an \u223c30% reduction in mortality after HSV challenge compared to mice treated with acyclovir alone.61 Agonists of TLR3 and TLR9 have also been studied in murine models of HSVE. TLR9 agonists are typically CpG oligodeoxynucleotides that activate production of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2. In a study in a mouse model of HSVE, intranasal administration of the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid before intranasal HSV challenge reduced severity of disease; however, administration after infection had already been established increased mortality and disease severity.62 In a similar experimental model, TLR9 agonist pretreatment increased survival from 15% to 70%.62, 63 Interestingly, a TLR9 antagonist also had a modest effect in improving survival when given either before or following viral challenge (15\u201330%). These results suggest that in some cases the very same cytokine responses that may reduce risk of infection play detrimental roles during established infection and suggest the potential complexity of targeting these pathways for antiviral therapy. The TLR3 agonist rintatolimod (Ampligen) has also been evaluated in a murine model of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus CNS infection. Intranasal and intraperitoneal administration of Ampligen at \u22124 and +24 hours in relation to intranasal Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus challenge prevented neuroinvasion and the development of symptomatic disease.

TLR agonists, including Ampligen, are now in human clinical trials in settings including HIV infection (eg, NCT00002269) and chronic fatigue syndrome (NCT00215813), but have not yet been evaluated in CNS infection. A potential cautionary note to the use of TNF\u03b1 antagonists in antiviral therapy is that at least 3 cases of HSV encephalitis have been reported in patients being treated with infliximab (n = 1) and adalimumab (n = 2) for rheumatologic disorders, including psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory polyarthritis.77 Similarly, treatment with TNF\u03b1 inhibitors may increase the risk of herpes zoster. A review of a German registry for patients being treated with biologics found 23 cases of zoster associated with treatment with TNF\u03b1 antibodies (adalimumab, infliximab) and 23 with TNF\u03b1 antagonist (etanercept).78 The estimated hazard ratio (HR; corrected for epidemiological factors) was 1.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05\u20133.15) for the antibodies, but nonsignificant (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 0.73\u20132.55) for etanercept. A more recent US study failed to find an increased risk for herpes zoster in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with anti\u2010TNF therapy,79 so the area remains unsettled. These studies at least raise the cautionary possibility that, for herpesviruses, TNF\u03b1 may play a role in controlling reactivation from latency. Latent states are not seen in arboviral infections, and the potential risks and benefits of TNF\u03b1 inhibition in these infections may be different than those seen in herpes viral infections. The use of TNF blockers may also increase the risk of reactivation of mycobacterial infections,80 which may further limit their use in populations where mycobacterial infections are endemic. Although there have been reports of PML in patients receiving anti\u2010TNF therapies, including infliximab81 and etanercept,82 all patients reported to date have had other diseases or therapies associated with risk of PML.

A proof of principle in human CNS disease comes from treatment of a patient with PML following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and immunosuppression for graft versus host disease.99 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from the stem cell donor, JCV antigen\u2010specific CTLs were generated after in vitro stimulation of these cells with peptides derived from the JCV for 1 month, and the patient received 2 infusions. He developed measurable CTL activity against the viral protein that had not been detectable preinfusion. He showed remarkable signs of clinical (ambulation, motor function, cognition) and magnetic resonance imaging improvement, and virus was cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Because this patient also received antiviral therapy and because of alterations in his immunosuppressive therapy, it is not possible to unequivocally attribute his response to his immunotherapy.

It has been estimated that 10 million to 16 million people worldwide receive rabies PEP every year and that a minimum of 55,000 rabies deaths occur.116 Current regimens rely on use of either human or equine rabies immunoglobulin coadministered with rabies vaccine. Phase I trials indicated that a cocktail of humanized anti\u2013rabies virus MAbs (CL184 manufactured by Crucell Holland, Leiden, the Netherlands) administered intramuscularly was safe in phase I human trials and did not interfere with the development of subsequent vaccine\u2010induced rabies virus\u2013neutralizing antibodies.117 Two phase II trials were completed in 2008 in children and adolescents in the Philippines (NCT00708084) and in adults in the United States (NCT00656097), followed by a third trial in adults in India that was just completed in late 2012 (NCT01228383).

Almost all trials of humanized MAbs have utilized passive transfer techniques in which antibody is directly administered either intravenously (eg, WNV MGAWN1) or intramuscularly (rabies CL84). A novel strategy referred to as vectored immunoprophylaxis utilizes gene transfer to express high levels of antibodies for prolonged periods. Humanized MAbs transferred by conventional passive methods can protect mice with humanized immune systems from HIV challenge.118 Human neutralizing anti\u2010HIV antibodies are also protective when expressed after a single intramuscular injection in mice using an adeno\u2010associated vector.119 In this system, antibody was detected within a week of injection, peaked at 12 to 16 weeks, and persisted for >64 weeks. This type of model may be a promising approach to avoiding repeated administration of antibodies in situations such as chronic disease or continued risk exposure, where treatment must ideally be maintained for periods exceeding the half\u2010life of individual antibody administration.",

Another strategy for use of these antibodies is to target key host cell components involved in viral binding or entry rather than viral proteins per se. This strategy has been successfully utilized in HIV infection, in which 2 different humanized MAbs (PRO 140 and HGS004) directed against domains on the amino\u2010terminal and extracellular loops of the HIV receptor CCR5 have been shown to be safe and well tolerated and to reduce plasma HIV viral load in phase I/II trials.120, 121 Phase I trials have also shown similar safety and efficacy for a humanized MAb, ibalizumab (TNX\u2010355), directed against CD4.122\n",
