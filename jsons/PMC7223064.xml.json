For categorical variables, differences were assessed using Chi-squared test. Linear interpolation was used to estimate the time spent in the desired PCO2 range throughout the CO2 inhalation. Regression modeling was performed to predict the changes of BD, pH, and lactate over time during the CO2 inhalation, using a repeated-measures linear mixed-effect model with first-order autoregressive within-group correlation structure fitted by maximizing the restricted log-likelihood. The following variables were considered to have fixed effects: blood gas value at the beginning of inhalation as baseline, time in hours since the beginning of inhalation, and Thompson encephalopathy score predicting adverse neurological outcome (low as 0, medium as 1, high as 2).26",

The increase in the death of respiration was clearly related to the CO2 exposition. All patients received sedato-analgesia (10 \u03bcg/kg/h morphine infusion) during the study period; therefore, we were unable to assess the possible discomfort caused by our intervention.

First, this was a small pilot study using a historical control group, which limits powerful efficacy analysis. Also, p value should be interpreted carefully within the context of the small sample size. Second, continuous monitoring of PCO2 was not feasible during the study because of current technical limitations. However, we performed frequent arterial blood gas sampling. Transcutaneous CO2 monitoring has not been tested systematically under HT treatment. Although end-tidal CO2 monitoring has become available recently, its precision is in question.40 Furthermore, owing to the gas flow turbulence in patient circuits, the exhaled gas can be diluted with the CO2-enriched inhaled gas mixture prior to reaching the sampling port. Another limitation of our study that the tidal volumes were collected manually throughout the study period, allowing for safety analysis of respiratory parameters. Of note, the manual data collection could lead to an observational bias. This pilot trial was an initial step to explore a novel intervention and identify the modifications that are needed for a larger randomized trial to test the efficacy of controlled normocapnia on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.",
