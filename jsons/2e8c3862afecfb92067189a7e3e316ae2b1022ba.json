High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a pivotal inflammatory mediator, plays a potential role as a prognostic biomarker in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this prospective, observational study was to investigate the relationship between serum HMGB1 concentrations and composite of morbidity endpoints in cardiac surgery. Arterial blood samples for HMGB1 measurement were collected from 250 patients after anaesthetic induction (baseline) and 1 h after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (post-CPB). The incidence of composite of morbidity endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure and prolonged ventilator care) was compared in relation to the tertile distribution of serum HMGB1 concentrations. The incidence of composite of morbidity endpoints was significantly different with respect to the tertile distribution of post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations (p = 0.005) only, and not to the baseline. Multivariable analysis revealed post-CPB HMGB1 concentration (OR, 1.072; p = 0.044), preoperative creatinine and duration of CPB as independent risk factors of adverse outcome. Accounting for its prominent role in mediating sterile inflammation and its relation to detrimental outcome, HMGB1 measured 1 h after weaning from CPB would serve as a useful biomarker for accurate risk stratification in cardiac surgical patients and may guide tailored anti-inflammatory therapy.",

However, no studies have examined the prognostic role of serum HMGB1 levels in cardiac surgery, while the importance of a reliable biomarker reflecting extensive systemic inflammation cannot be overemphasized in terms of accurate risk stratification and as a potential guide for selective application of therapies in that regard.

Well-known downstream molecular pathways that further aggravate systemic inflammation and tissue injury involve the activation of toll-like receptors, receptors for advanced glycation products, and NF-\u03baB 20 . Accordingly, increases in the concentration of HMGB1 in the blood has been implicated as a potential biochemical marker of inflammation linked to outcomes in clinical practice 21 . Indeed, the concentration-dependent activity of HMGB1 has been shown to be associated with the occurrence, development, and prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases by recent studies that include acute coronary syndrome, MI, and heart failure 11, 22, 23 .

            "text": "Notably, post-induction HMGB1 concentrations were not linked to adverse outcomes, indicating that the baseline inflammatory status of the patients does not necessarily lead to extensive systemic inflammatory response after surgery. This contrasts with the prognostic value of pre-operative (baseline) high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, which has been shown to be related to an increased risk of major cardiovascular and cerebral events 24 . However, taking into account its characteristics as a nonspecific acute phase reactant, hsCRP seems to be more closely related to the vascular risks such as plaque rupture and vascular thrombosis, showing its predictive role to be limited to the cardiovascular events in patients with coronary and/or metabolic disease 5 . Congruent to our results, CPB duration 25 and pre-operative creatinine 26 are well-recognized risk factors of post-operative morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery. A prolonged duration of CPB may affect the level of post-CPB HMGB1. However, the correlation between post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations and CPB duration was weak (\u03b2 coefficient = 0.373), while the independence of these variables on predicting outcome could be verified in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Therefore, our results implicate that extensive and harmful inflammatory response cannot be anticipated simply by the patient's baseline inflammatory status or the duration of CPB adding value to the prognostic importance of post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations in that regard. Of note, inflammatory response is meant to be protective, which is possibly the main reason why studies validating the efficacies of indiscriminate anti-inflammatory measures on outcomes after cardiac surgery yielded conflicting results 6 . Whether tailored anti-inflammatory therapy guided by post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations would actually improve outcome remains to be proven by future studies.",

Second, since our study involved complex valvular heart surgeries, caution should be exercised not to extrapolate our results to other cardiac surgeries.
