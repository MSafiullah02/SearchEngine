Entry of a virus into the specific host cell depends on the precise attachment or fitting of the viral surface molecules with the molecules of the host cell. Each viral strain is unique in its surface antigenic structure, host cell receptors, and life cycle, and thus adopts various invasion strategies to infect every form of life. Due to their genetic variation, mode of transmission, effective replication, and the ability to persist within the host, viruses can cause widespread diseases from bacteria to humans [3], [4], [5], [6].",

Several reports on the discovery of new drugs from traditional medicines [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] indicated the use of medicinal plants as a potential source for antiviral drug development [1], [7], [8], [9]. Several reports indicated that a wide variety of phytochemicals, including alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, polyphenolics, coumarins, lignans, have therapeutic applications [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] due to their interferences on viral entry or replication, along with their antioxidative properties [6], [9], [13]. Different in vitro and in vivo bioassays on phytochemicals lead to the identification of potential antiviral molecules. In this chapter, we will summarize the scientific approaches used to validate potential \u201cantiviral leads\u201d against selected genetically and functionally diverse viral families, from crude extracts to pure compounds. In-depth studies on some common in vitro antiviral assays with testing of efficacies, modes, and molecular mechanisms of action will be described here with in vivo methods against a few selected viruses.",

Public health measures such as safe drinking water can prevent Polio and Rota virus infections, while pest control can prevent arthropod and rodent-borne yellow fever, dengue, encephalitis, and hanta and arena viruses. However, to provide these benefits to the people of underdeveloped and developing world is a challenge. A second challenge is to discover means to control airborne respiratory infections. As public health measures are never totally effective, vaccination is a second strategy. Although vaccines dramatically decreased the incidence of polio, yellow fever, rabies, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B, they are not yet effective in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza, including common cold, caused by 100+ strains of Rhinoviruses. Developing a polyvalent vaccine against all these viruses is also a challenge. Moreover, Alpha and Filovirus (Ebola) cause devastating epidemics with sporadic outbreaks, and it is difficult to vaccinate the entire population to eradicate them. Thus, infection can and will occur despite the best effort of humankind. Hence, for antiviral drug development, scientists are looking into the features of an ideal antiviral drug that (1) effectively inhibits some essential viral processes, (2) prevents the development of drug-resistant viruses, (3) has broad activity (single drug against any of the 100+ common cold viruses), and (4) has minimum or no effect on the host system. The first feature is obvious while the remaining depend on the viral process being targeted.",

Moreover, several viral diseases require long-term treatment that usually leads to the development of drug-resistant viruses. The existing antiviral nucleoside analogs act as antimetabolites in DNA synthesis and prevent viral replication in infected cells, and the related nucleotide analogs are used against hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, HSV, and HIV. In infected cells, these analogs are incorporated into the replicating DNA strand and phosphorylated as a chain terminator to stop viral DNA polymerase activity, and affect the mitochondrial DNA, leading to adverse effects such as bone marrow suppression. Another family of synthetic nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase (RT) inhibitors help to design drugs with preferential activity, while some nucleoside analogs can act as nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors for HBV. Thus, antiviral nucleotides analogs repress viral reproduction by interfering with viral nucleic acid replication, compete with natural deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP)/NTP substrates, and incorporate into the nascent viral nucleic acid leading to chain termination or mutagenesis (Table 8.1\n).",

As antiviral drugs are virus specific and target oriented, they require appropriate diagnosis before therapeutic intervention. Another factor is the availability of suitable vaccines and their degree of effectiveness against a particular virus, as vaccination is the most effective approach for the prevention of a disease. However, in diseases such as hepatitis B, infected patients provide a large market for chemotherapy. Therefore, there is an unmatched need for readily available antiviral drugs at affordable prices with minimal side effects. Hence, traditional medicines are explored as novel antiviral agents, as many of these ancient medicaments, containing diverse plant metabolites, have potent antiviral activities [10], [11], [12], [19], [20].",

            "text": "Despite continuous advancement in medical science, viral diseases are a major cause of death around the globe. The development of an antiviral drug depends on the unique features of host\u2013virus interactions, as viruses are acellular and host- and route-specific, and infect only by their nucleic acid(s) that regulate the host cell DNA for multiplication. Being an obligate intracellular parasite, viral replication depends on the metabolic pathways of the host. Thus, designing an effective antiviral drug to target virus-specific enzymes or replication steps without affecting the host cell is very difficult [20]. Advancement in molecular biology and genetics helps to design a rational approach for developing antiviral agents by targeting specific sites/steps of the viral life cycle, including (1) inactivation of the extracellular virus particles, (2) prevention of viral attachment or fusion, (3) entry or penetration, (4) replication of viral genome, (5) synthesis of viral-specific proteins or intermediates, and (6) assembly or release of new virions. However, the most desirable target is the inhibition of major viral enzymes essential for replication and spread of the disease. Most of the well-studied inhibitors of HIV, HSV, or Influenza viruses target the host cell binding (T-20, betulinic acid), uncoating of capsid (amantadine, pleconaril), viral replication (RT inhibitors: zidovudine, abacavir, nevirapine), viral enzymes integrase or DNA/RNA polymerase (acyclovir, cidofovir, ribavirin), proteinases of polyprotein precursors, and assembly or maturation (indinavir, ritonavir, rimantadine). On the basis of these strategies, several compounds were tested on different viruses, but only 40 licensed antivirals are approved till 2014 [1], [5]. Moreover, studies on viral genomics, gene functions, and regulations led to the rational designing of gene-based drugs that induce protective antiviral immunity, interference with viral replication, gene expression, or viral messenger RNAs with limited delivery to the sites of replication and nuclease degradation [13].",

The discovery of synthetic drugs with better efficacy and quick recovery in many diseases leads to several adverse effects during long-term clinical use, particularly in chronic or \u201cdifficult-to-treat\u201d diseases. Thus, there has been a huge upsurge in the use of natural products for preventing and treating serious viral diseases. However, most herbal products have no quality control, are unable to provide consistent results, and even produce undesirable effects. About 40% of the modern-day anticancer and antimicrobial drugs have their roots in traditional medicine [4], [5], [20], but till 2014, we have barely analyzed the tip of iceberg to design more drugs from plants. Hence, it is of utmost importance to search for phytochemicals with antiviral potential from unexplored plants used in ethnomedicine, before we lose our herbal resources due to rapid anthropogenic activities including industrialization and urbanization [1], [8].",

During the past 40 years, numerous broad-based screening programs for the antiviral activity of medicinal plants have been initiated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Out of 100 British Colombian medicinal plants, only a few showed activities against corona viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), para influenza, and HSV [22], while the marine algae Spirulina showed antimutagenic, immunomodulatory, and antiviral activities [23], [24]. Interestingly, Cyanovirin N, an 11-kDa protein of blue green algae, inactivates HIV-1 by binding with its glycoprotein120 [25], while sulfated polysaccharides of seaweeds and alga showed anti-HIV and anti-HSV activities [26]. A list of selected medicinal plants and their compounds having antiviral activities against common viral diseases is presented in Table 8.3\n, and the structures of some important compounds are depicted in Figure 8.1\n.",

TZM-bl cells are HeLa cell clones, engineered to express cluster of differentiation 4 and C\u2013C chemokine receptor type 5, and contain integrated reporter genes for firefly luciferase and Escherichia coli \u03b2-galactosidase under the control of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat. Thus, they are highly sensitive and prone to infection by immunodeficiency viruses including primary HIV-1 isolates and cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses. Here, diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran is used to enhance infectivity during neutralization. Soon after infection, reporter gene expression is induced by a viral transactivator protein Tat. Luciferase activity can be quantified by luminescence and is directly proportional to the number of infectious virus particles present in the initial inoculum [85]. This high-throughput assay requires a 96-well plate, and clonal cells provide enhanced precision and uniformity. This has been validated for a single-round infection with either uncloned viruses grown in human lymphocytes or molecularly cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses produced by transfection in 293T/17 cells [85].",

In contrast to the plaque assay, HA cannot measure of viral infectivity, because no virus replication is required in this assay. It is an easy, simple, and rapid method for large samples, and the conditions depend on the type of virus, as some viruses bind RBCs only at certain pH values, others are at certain ionic strengths. If a test drug inhibits virus replication, it will also affect the viral titer and will thus reduce the HA value. Briefly, the virus dilution (1:4\u20131:512) is applied to an RBC dilution (0.1\u20130.7% for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, because the viruses with neuraminidase activity will detach from the RBCs, and then the lattice-forming parts will be counted to calculate the titer as Virus concentration/ml = 107 X HA titer.",

The cells are washed with PBS (2X), and the quantity of the cell pack (2.0 ml blood yields 0.5\u20131.0 ml pack) is measured in 10% suspension with PBS. The RBC solution (0.75%) in PBS (0.75 ml 10% RBCs in 10 ml PBS, pH 7.2) is added to each well of a 96-well plate, except for the first well of each row, along with the antigen (culture fluid containing virus from drug-treated and untreated controls) to the first two wells of each row. A twofold dilution (transferring 50 \u03bcl from the second well of each column A2-K2 to A3-K3) is mixed with 0.75% RBCs (50 ml) in all wells, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The cell control needs to be checked for the complete settling of the RBCs, and the results are recorded in the HA sheet. The RBCs form a button or ring at the bottom of the wells that is recorded as \u201cO,\u201d while hemagglutination (RBCs remain in suspension) is recorded as a + symbol. The highest dilution of virus that causes complete hemagglutination is considered as the end point. The HA titer is the reciprocal of the dilution of the virus in the last well with complete hemagglutination (Figure 8.4\n).",

A threshold is set above the baseline to get a threshold cycle value (Ct), which is the cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold with a statistically significant increase in fluorescence.

Synthesized protein labeled with Click-iT Metabolic Labeling Reagents and 293T cells transfected with pNL4-3 are used. At 3 h posttransfection, the cell supernatant is replaced with fresh medium with or without 10 \u03bcM fangchinoline. After 24 h, the cells need to be labeled with azidohomoalanine (AHA; 50 \u03bcM) for 1 h in methionine-free medium with or without fangchinoline. The supernatant is then replaced with complete medium in the presence or absence of fangchinoline, and the cells should be chased for the indicated time, after being lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1% SDS, protease inhibitor). The AHA-incorporated protein is then biotinylated by the Click-instant Protein reaction buffer Kit and Biotin Alkyne. After precipitation and dissolution, the biotinylated protein needs to be collected with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1, and the purified nascent protein will be eluted into the SDS-PAGE buffer by boiling for Western blot analysis [85].",

Gel shift assays are often performed to study transcription initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair, or RNA processing and maturation.

The virus establishes latency and reactivates [109]. Successful inoculation (100%) of eyes on day 7 will produce herpetic dendritic ulcers with significant HSV-1 titer (104\n pfu/ml) and viral shedding, determined by a neutralization test. After satisfactory anesthesia, the globe is proptosed with a wooden cotton applicator and an operating microscope for all surgical manipulations. The intrastromal injection (0.25-ml tuberculin syringe with a no. 30 short bevel needle) is given into the central corneal stroma. The first group is given deionized sterile endotoxin-free water; the second group is given 100 \u03bcl air, while the 3rd group is not given any injection. For all three groups, the needle should be carefully withdrawn with gentle pressure so that the proptosed globe gently returns to the orbit. The anterior chamber, injected with deionized sterile water, is made at the limbus, inserted into the anterior chamber parallel to the iris plane. The needle is carefully withdrawn, and the insertion site is pressed with a cotton swab for 30 s, to avoid aqueous loss, and return of the proptosed globe to its proper place in the orbit. For topical administration, 100 ml deionized sterile water is administered onto the cornea of the proptosed globe by means of a pipette, and the globe returns to the orbit by gentle digital pressure. Viral Shedding (latent HSV-1 after reactivation and induced shedding into the tear film) is determined by swabbing the eyes 2 days before treatment and for seven consecutive days after the treatment. Each eye swab is mixed with 0.3 ml MEM (Eagle's medium with Earle's salt, 10% newborn calf serum, 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin, 1% Fungizone), vortexed, and the eluant is plated onto a Vero cell monolayer. After a 1-h adsorption, 1.5 ml of medium is added to the well, and the plate is examined daily for 7 days for the CPE of HSV-1.

The hardware includes a transmitter (E-Mitter)/receiver system that collects data on temperature and motor activity. The vitality or gross motor activity provides a basic index of the movement of mice with implanted E-Mitter. As the mouse moves, the movement of the implanted E-Mitter results in subtle changes in the transmitted signal detected by a receiver and registered by a computer. The Vital View software recorded an index of movement every 5 min to produce a longitudinal record of the activity, and for implantation of E-Mitters the mice are anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 150 \u03bcl ketamine/rompun. The shaved ventral surface of the abdomen with a midline abdominal skin incision 0.5\u20131 cm below the diaphragm with a 2-cm length. The abdomen is opened with a 2-cm incision along the linea alba to position the E-Mitter in the abdominal cavity. Then the closure of the incision is achieved with wound clips (autoclip 9 mm; Becton & Dickinson, Germany). The animals are placed into the cage, and successful implantation of the E-Mitter is controlled by Vital View software. Their health status is controlled for seven days before infection.",

Briefly, RNA is extracted and eluted and then subjected to RT-PCR after initial reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse-transcriptase (MMLV-RT) to synthesize the cDNA. The cDNA synthesis is usually carried out in a 10-\u03bcl volume with RT-mix (5 \u00d7 -RT buffer, 10 mM dNTPs, 5U RNasin, 5U MMLV-RT) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h using a downstream consensus primer (MP4).

The currently available antivirals, though effective, are costly and beyond the reach of a vast majority of people. Thus, the development of safe, effective, and low cost antiviral drugs such as RT inhibitors is among the top priorities, as many viruses are not yet curable and have high mortality rates. Recently, considerable work has been done on medicinal plants focusing on anti-HIV activity [119], [120], [121], [122], and there has been a considerable rise in the use of over-the-counter plant products containing orthodox drugs. The rationale is to reduce the side effects and to produce synergistic effects. But since in most cases pharmacological mechanisms of the combinations are not studied, adverse effects or therapeutic failures have been observed [123]. The most important consideration involving medicinal plants is to identify and standardize the method of preparation of extract, appropriate season of collecting plant material, and details of its administration [20], [124]. Since a significant number of plant extracts has yielded positive results, it seems reasonable to conclude that there are probably many potential antiviral agents, and further characterization of active ingredients of those potential plants will reveal useful compounds.",
