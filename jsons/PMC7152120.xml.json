A document by the historian Pliny details search and rescue attempts to save individuals from debris. The Emperor Titus declared a state of emergency and immediately sent his army to assist with the relief effort in Stabia, Ercolano, and Pompei. The survivors were relocated to unaffected areas to rebuild with new cities. Despite all the populations\u2019 efforts and funding from Titus, the devastated populations were unable to recover. Only decades later under Emperor Adrian, in 120 ad, was the devastated area restored.8\n",

Lisbon was struck by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake which caused between 10,000 and 100,000 deaths. It was one of the deadliest earthquakes in modern history. The Royal Family escaped unharmed from the catastrophe, and the Prime Minister implemented and managed a formal search and rescue initiative with regional rehabilitation efforts. After the first response phase, the King and Prime Minister Marquis de Pombal proposed plans to rebuild the city. Less than a month after the event, five plan options were proposed for the rebuilding of Lisbon and, within a year, the city was cleared of debris and reconstruction began. The event had wide-ranging effects on the population. Moreover, a disaster recovery program was established that included, among other things, rebuilding the city with more solid construction.9\n,\n10\n",

In 2015, more than 5 years after the disaster, the capital is still not completely clear of debris. More than 1.6 million citizens remain displaced and live in refugee camps with no electricity, running water, or sewage disposal. A cholera epidemic, which began in October 2010, killed more than 8000 Haitians. Crime in the camps is widespread with women and children as the predominant victims.

The local government asked Congress for help, creating the first legislative act for federal resources. In 1950 the first permanent and general legislation, the Federal Disaster Act, came into existence. This was revolutionary because it was the first act to create a general response to all disasters. Before this, each disaster resulted in Congress passing a new localized piece of legislation. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter pulled all the distinct response groups together along with the military resources to create FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was formally implemented by executive orders on April 1, 1979.",

In a small local disaster, volunteer organizations such as the Red Cross and private insurers may be enough to aid victims. When a disaster overwhelms the recovery forces of a community, that community in the United States can turn to the State government, and ultimately to FEMA, for resources. Within the first 48 hours of a disaster, assessment teams should provide an initial assessment of the damage. This includes identifying immediate needs such as food, shelter, and infrastructural deficits and requirements. Local government will conduct a preliminary damage assessment to determine whether federal aid should be requested. Once the immediate needs are identified, and if federal aid is requested, a second, more in-depth survey should be done by FEMA. This second survey should include reviewing plans of and for the displaced citizens: Do they plan to move, or rebuild in the same spot? Public infrastructure, sewers, and storm drains should be examined. What about the town? What was there before the disaster? What currently exists? Were there any existing plans for expansion of the area that could be used for rebuilding? What are the opportunities looking at the long term?15\n",

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, if that state is overwhelmed and state resources are not enough to provide aid.16 In 2000 there were 45 major disaster declarations from 31 states and the District of Columbia.17 These disasters ranged from tornados to wildfires to winter storms. Initial resources supplied included food, water, emergency generators, and the mobilization of specialized teams (e.g., search and rescue, medical assistance, damage assessment, and communications). For longer term relief, there are loans and grants to repair or replace housing and personal property, roads, and public buildings. There is also assistance for mitigation opportunities, counseling, and legal services. These services are outlined in the U.S. Federal Response Plan (FRP), which describes the policies and plans of 25 federal departments and the U.S. Red Cross.16 The FRP can be implemented in conjunction with other specialized groups including plans for telecommunications support, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan, and the Terrorism Incident Annex.16 Some federal agencies have the authority to provide disaster aid even when the magnitude is not sufficient for the president to declare a federal disaster, such as the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Small Business Association (SBA). The FRP employs a multiagency operations structure based on the Incident Command System (ICS). Disaster Field Offices under the Department of Homeland Security may be created along with a national emergency response team. Recovery efforts are the responsibility of logistics and administration teams within disaster field offices.",

The primary objective of recovery planning is to enable an organization to survive a disaster and to continue normal business operations. To survive, the organization must ensure that critical operations can resume or continue normal processing and minimize the duration of a serious disruption to operations and resources (both information processing and other resources); a premade contingency plan is the best method of accomplishing this.18 Specific measures may include having an alternate site of operations if the current facility is damaged, storing vital documents off-site or virtually in the Cloud, and having an alternative energy source such as a generator which is located well above the high water line and not in a basement. Larger businesses may be better able to withstand a disaster because assets and the workforce may be dispersed across a wider geographic area.6\n",

This is referred to as \u201ctop-down\u201d theory.20 In addition to not providing optimal care, this may impede self-sufficiency of these disaster-stricken areas. Assumptions may be made, including the following: (1) the victims are a burden; (2) the host government is weak and cannot manage alone; (3) foreign aid organizations do not require accountability; (4) aid for the victims reflect the defined needs of the victims (when, in fact, the aid reflects the projected need by the donor).20 An example of this last point was when Hurricane Hugo struck Montserrat in 1989. Ninety-eight percent of all homes were affected, 50% severely and 20% completely destroyed.20 The Peace Corps brought in large numbers of prefabricated housing to replace all the destroyed homes. Although they were able to help a lot of people numerically, the homes they provided had two-sided pitched roofs instead of the typical Caribbean four-sided roofs that were better able to withstand tropical winds. They also did not have an interior design to allow for cross ventilation. The early recipients of the homes reported this finding to the Peace Corps, but the Peace Corps was unable to change the design. Although well intentioned, the Peace Corps was predominantly meeting the need projected by the donors instead of the actual needs of the victims.20\n",

In Jamaica, after Hurricane Gilbert, the primary housing aid program was the Building Stamp Programme, which was set up by the Jamaican government, the World Bank, Canada, Germany, Japan, OPEC, and the United States. Homeowners were issued building stamps based on the extent of damages and financial need. These stamps would then be redeemed only at building supply stores who were members of the Jamaican Hardware Merchants Association for building materials, including zinc sheets, nails, and lumber. Squatters and renters were not eligible for stamps and were left without any recourse for finding aid. People who were not at home during the time of the survey were not listed as needing aid.20 It was also found that the stamps were distributed unequally. As a result, many needy people were left without any support.",

Internationally, studies have shown that many community plans focus primarily on the emergency period and do not give adequate attention to recovery and reconstruction. If there is a plan, it often exists on paper only and, in the case of an actual disaster, it is not used. Many officials may not be aware that a plan exists.4 These flaws lead to chaotic implementation of an ad hoc recovery. The community lacks the ability to work together and thus fragments and cannot unify to control its own affairs. As a result, the redevelopment is likely to be inadequate to fulfill the needs of the community. If there is aid from government and nongovernmental groups, they are sometimes uncoordinated, either duplicating actions, leaving areas without any aid, or giving aid that is inadequate for the needs of the area.4 In Saragossa, Texas, a small isolated community devastated by a tornado in 1987, there was no local government in place at all. When a disaster advisory board was created, it was done without any input from the local inhabitants. The outcome was that the Saragossans considered themselves worse off 2 years after the tornado than they had been beforehand, both because of the quality of the rebuilt neighborhoods and because they felt they were looked on as helpless and ungrateful.2\n",

When a plan is in place before a disaster, it allows for a strong horizontal network. Then, when a useful vertical element is added, the results can work wonders. By 1975, recurrent floods had repeatedly decimated the town of Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin. Each time the town rebuilt. At one point they added a dam, and they planned for a levee, but were unable because of financial restrictions. They decided they would take the funds allocated for the levee and use it to plan for town relocation. Although federal funds were slow in coming, they did create a plan. In 1978, when the largest flood in the history of the area occurred, they were ready with a fully written strategy. When they were granted funds for reconstruction, they put their plan into effect. Not only did they relocate out of the flood plain to prevent reoccurrence of this destruction, but they also decided to create a town that was 75% solar powered.5 Because they had had the luxury of time in the planning stage, they had asked each business owner where they wanted to be located and how they wanted their business to be built. As a result, the town became not only exactly what the community wanted, but also its creation instilled a great sense of pride and satisfaction in its citizens, thus creating a happier community as well.",
