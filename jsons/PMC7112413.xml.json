We used commercially available interferons (Intron A [interferon \u03b1-2b], Essex Pharma, Munich, Germany; Betaferon [interferon \u03b2-1b], Schering, Berlin; and Imukin [interferon \u03b3-1b], Boehringer, Ingelheim) that have been used for their antiviral, antitumour, and immunomodulating activities. We visually scored cytopathogenic effects induced by the virus 72 h after infection in 96-well microplates on confluent layers of Vero and Caco2 cells, the latter derived from human colonic tumour, treated with interferons 24 h before and immediately after virus infection (mutiplicity of infection 0\u201301). The selectivity index was defined as the ratio of the concentration of the interferon that reduced cell viability to 50% (CC50) to the concentration of the compound needed to inhibit the cytopathic effect to 50% of control value (EC50). We assessed the cytotoxic effects of the drugs with an MTT cell-proliferative Kit I (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Viral titres in supernatants collected from infected cultures 72 h after infection were measured by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) calculated from cytopathogenic effects induced in monolayers incubated with varying dilutions of the supernatants. To validate the interferon effects on SARS-CoV, we included vesicular stomatitis virus (strain Indiana), replication of which is extremely sensitive to interferon action.",

In Vero cells, selectivity index of interferon \u03b2 activity for SARS-CoV strain FFM-1 was 50-fold and 25-fold higher than that of interferon \u03b1 and interferon \u03b3, respectively. Sensitivity of the Hong Kong isolate was similar to that for the FFM-1 strain. Interferon \u03b2 (EC50 105 IU/mL) was more potent than interferons \u03b1 or \u03b3 (EC50s 6500 IU/mL and 1700 IU/mL, respectively). Vesicular stomatitis virus strain Indiana was much more sensitive to interferon treatment than SARS-CoV; interferon \u03b2 had the highest antiviral activity in Vero cell cultures (EC50 18 IU/mL).",

We infected Vero cells with FFM-1 strain at multipicity of infection 0\u00b701 and assessed viral replication by peroxidase staining with immune serum after treatment with different concentrations of interferon (figure\n). Native cells, or cells fixed with 60 parts methanol to 40 parts acetone were assessed 72 h after infections. We also quantified the genomic titre (RNA copies/mL) with real-time PCR. Interferon \u03b2 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the production of infectious virus in culture. In the absence of virus induced cytopathogenic effects, however, interferon \u03b2 treatment did not completely reduce virus titre and antigen production. In cultures treated with 10 000 IU/mL, a reduction of about 5\u00d7104-fold was noted compared with the untreated control (1\u00b79\u00d7102\nvs 9\u00b77\u00d7106 TCID50 /mL). The number of gene copies are reduced by interferon \u03b2 in a dose-dependent way; however, the magnitude is around 3\u00b73\u20134\u00b75 log higher than the infectious virus titre measured in cell culture. This difference may be due to the presence of non-infectious viral RNA or the overexpression of the sequence amplified in our real-time PCR system. Similar observations have been made by Garcia and colleagues3 on the quantitative detection of Rift valley fever virus gene copies to assess the antiviral effect of drugs.",

We noted that interferon \u03b2 was by far more effective than interferon \u03b1 against SARS-CoV and vesicular stomatitis virus. Although interferons \u03b1 and \u03b2 primarily induce the same proteins, some proteins may be induced by one better than the other. By use of oligonucleotide arrays, Der and colleagues4 identified the genes differentially regulated by interferons. They reported more than a 21-fold increase of MxA protein by interferon \u03b1, more than a 31-fold increase by interferon \u03b2, and none by interferon \u03b3. Gene-array analysis of Caco2 cells infected with FFM-1 in our laboratory has shown a nine-fold increase of MxA gene expression in cultures 24 h after infection. This increase could be one of the reasons for amplification of interferon \u03b2 effect that yields the higher antiviral potential.",
