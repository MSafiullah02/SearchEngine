V. vulnificus infection is a highly lethal disease, which is responsible for 95% of all seafood\u2010related deaths in the United States, with a fatality rate of approximately 50%. Due to its capacity to cause rapid death among high\u2010risk populations, V. vulnificus is considered one of the most dangerous foodborne pathogens for humans (Baker\u2010Austin & Oliver, 2016; Oliver, 2005).",

Oral ingestion mainly leads to primary septicemia when people consume contaminated raw or uncooked seafood (Kim, Bae, Ma, & Kim, 2015). Symptoms of primary septicemia include fever, chills, nausea, and hypotension. Wound infection is generally acquired through the exposure of a preexisting wound to contaminated seawater or shellfish, resulting in fulminant necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections (Huang et al., 2016; Kotton, Soboh, & Bisharat, 2015). Previous reports indicated that V. vulnificus can only affect humans and other primates. Although V. vulnificus accumulates in oysters due to their filter feeding of particles from seawater, V. vulnificus infection causes no clinical signs in shellfish. Therefore, it is difficult to identify V. vulnificus\u2010containing oysters without laboratory detection.",

As reported, the majority of human infections occur in the subtropical regions from April to November. People over the age of 40 are predominantly infected. Moreover, males are more susceptible than females (Ito et al., 2012), perhaps due to the role of estrogen in protecting against the bacterium's endotoxins (Miyamoto et al., 1999; Soucy, Boivin, Labrie, & Rivest, 2005). As mentioned previously, patients with underlying chronic diseases, including alcoholism, diabetes, cancer, or renal diseases, are more susceptible to V. vulnificus (Bross, Soch, Morales, & Mitchell, 2007a). Several other risk factors contribute to the high pathogenicity of V. vulnificus in humans, such as capsule, iron, and the vcg gene (Jones & Oliver, 2009).",

Possession of an antiphagocytic capsule is one of the absolute requirements for virulence. Encapsulated cells produce opaque colonies, and only opaque cells are able to utilize transferrin\u2010bound iron. As shown in Figure 2b, the V. vulnificus isolate BJ\u2010PH01 grew opaque colonies on blood agar. This result prompted us to consider that BJ\u2010PH01 is virulent in animal models (Simpson, White, Zane, & Oliver, 1987). Several animal models have been constructed to explore the increased susceptibility to V. vulnificus infections after the injection of iron\u2010containing compounds. Here, we conducted an animal experiment using intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections or intramuscular (i.m.) injections and concurrent i.p. injections with PBS. Six\u2010 to eight\u2010week\u2010old female BALB/c mice were included in the experiment.

V. vulnificus was isolated from all six of the investigated aquariums. The average positive rate was 44.4%, ranging from 20% to 100% (Table 2). Finally, 12 strains of V. vulnificus were successfully isolated and identified.

The ary gene has been demonstrated to be associated with virulence of clinical strains by providing a pathogen with sulfur within the host, thus providing an immune evasion approach (Morrison et al., 2012). Positive Ary PCRs were obtained in all of the isolated strains. Although mtlABC appears to be linked to pathogen virulence, the precise role of mtlABC is not yet understood (Reynaud et al., 2013). In our experiments, we obtained positive mtlABC results for all of the isolated strains. The nanA gene has been demonstrated to be involved in sialic acid metabolism and is essential for V. vulnificus virulence (Kim, Hwang, Kim, & Choi, 2011). Positive nanA gene PCR results were obtained for all of the isolated strains. These results indicate that the 12 isolated V. vulnificus strains display a potential threat to mammals, including marine animals and humans.",

Protection for marine mammals from multiple threats has increased since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972. However, the lack of scientific data, confusion about permitting requirements, failure to adopt appropriate management, and inappropriate human activities have impaired our protection efforts (Schipper et al., 2008). Infectious disease is one of the most important risks to wildlife animals. Scientific research on marine mammal infectious diseases has been relatively insufficient. Previously demonstrated pathogens of marine mammals include viruses (e.g., adenovirus, calicivirus, herpesvirus, morbillivirus, poxvirus, influenza virus, retrovirus) (Goldstein et al., 2009; Maness et al., 2011; Ohishi et al., 2010; Ramis, van Riel, van de Bildt, Osterhaus, & Kuiken, 2012; Rivera, Nollens, Venn\u2010Watson, Gulland, & Wellehan, 2010), bacteria (e.g., Actinomycetes, Brucella, Clostridia, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Pasteurella multocida, and Mycoplasma) (Waltzek, Cort\u00e9s\u2010Hinojosa, Wellehan, & Gray, 2012), and parasites (e.g., Acanthocephalans, Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis, Coccidia, and Parafilaroides decorus) (Hernandez\u2010Orts et al., 2015; Jensen, Aars, Lydersen, Kovacs, & \u00c5sbakk, 2010). Here, we demonstrated that spotted seals can be infected by V. vulnificus. As no host tropism of V. vulnificus has been reported, one can speculate that other marine mammals might also be infected with V. vulnificus. Therefore, we should pay more attention to abnormal deaths of wild marine mammals to accumulate scientific data.",

In Asia, Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a common cause of foodborne disease (Sakata, Yonekita, & Kawatsu, 2018), while Vibrio alginolyticus is implicated in wound infections and otitis. Vibrio alginolyticus was recently recognized as a human pathogen after excessive exposure to seawater (Gao et al., 2017). Vibrio fluvialis has been considered an emerging pathogen that induces foodborne diarrhea (Ramamurthy, Chowdhury, Pazhani, & Shinoda, 2014).
