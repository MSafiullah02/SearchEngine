However, the common characteristics of some new diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first studied in 2003, avian influenza first studied in 2008, and the swine influenza pandemic first studied in 2009, suggest that ALI may initiate these pathologies, and in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with rapid pulmonary fibrosis (RPF), ALI can be the most important lethal factor in the short-term [3]. Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the mechanisms of repair and remodeling in acute lung injury have recently gained much attention [1], [4], [5], [6]. Based on the common characteristics and mechanisms of these diseases, we established a new RPF model that could be induced by ALI via a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) three-hit regimen and found that days 3\u20137 and 14\u201321 were two important time windows for RPF.",

HC water extracts had immunomodulatory and anti-SARS activities, as evidenced by the ability to significantly inhibit SARS-CoV 3C-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [10], which significantly and dose-dependently stimulated the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes and increased the proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10. The HC ethanol extract inhibited the expression of IL-4 and IL-5 and the migration of TARC-induced Jurkat T cells. The injection of HC had a direct inhibitory effect on Pseudorabies herpesvirus (PrV) in vitro\n[11], and HC was shown to be a selective COX-2 inhibitor [12]. The volatile chemical components of HC are its main pharmacologically active components [13], [14]. Therefore, the volatile extract of HC might be an alternative drug for treating RPF.",

The HC content of these four components was stable across groups, accounting for 80.61\u201391.68% of the total amount, with an average content of 86.99%. In contrast, other components were present in smaller quantities (13.02 \u00b1 5.72%) and were not as stable across the groups, suggesting that they are not responsible for the main pharmacological effect. Therefore, we choose \u03b1\u2010terpineol, l-bornyl acetate and methyl-n-nonyl ketone to study the potential pharmacological mechanism of the four components. Some reports [17] have proposed that sodium houttuyfonate (SH) was the effective component of HC. Thus, we used HC as the positive control. RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells are typical immune and fibroblast cells, respectively. These are two important cell types involved in damage and repair. We observed the viability of RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of treatment with the HC vapor extract (10%, 30%, 50%; HC), \u03b1-terpineol (0.1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml), l-bornyl acetate (2.5 \u03bcl/ml, 5 \u03bcl/ml, 10 \u03bcl/ml), methyl-n-nonyl ketone (1 \u03bcl/ml, 2 \u03bcl/ml, 4 \u03bcl/ml) and SH (32 \u03bcg/ml, 64 \u03bcg/ml, 128 \u03bcg/ml). After 48 h, LPS (100 ng/ml), HC vapor extract, SH and \u03b1-terpineol inhibited the viability of RAW264.7 cells, but l-bornyl acetate enhanced viability significantly and dose-dependently (Fig. 6A). In addition, HC vapor extract, \u03b1-terpineol and l-bornyl acetate inhibited the viability of NIH/3T3 cells significantly and dose-dependently (Fig. 6B). We also observed the viability of cells 24 h and 72 h after being treated with LPS or without treatment with LPS. The results show that the HC vapor extract can inhibit the viability of RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells.",
