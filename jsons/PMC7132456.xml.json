During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (from February to July 2003), one of the costs of going to the doctor (especially doctors in hospitals) was the risk of being infected or stigmatized with SARS. Studies have revealed that a large decrease in healthcare utilization occurred during the SARS epidemics [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Nonetheless, little is known about whether this reduction in utilization was the same of different across different disease categories.",

To group the visits by disease categories, Clinical Classification Software (CCS) was used. The CCS grouping scheme, which was composed of 260 mutually exclusive disease categories, was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). CCS categories are revised regularly in response to ICD-9-CM annual changes, and the entire CCS can be downloaded for free from the Internet [10]. CCS has proven to be a good classification scheme for casemix adjustment [11] and for utilization studies [12]. One special feature of the CCS grouping scheme is that diseases with a similar etiology across organ system chapters are combined [13].",

The second question bothering patients was whether to go to medical centers or to go to nearby clinics. The decision of where to go was based on the patients\u2019 perceived capability of providers, and the sophistication of the equipment required by various levels of healthcare facilities in treating these specific diseases. It has long been criticized that the demand on outpatient services in medical centers and regional hospitals in Taiwan is too high [16]. The degree of shift in utilization behaviour from medical centers to clinics during the SARS epidemics might also provide a surrogate measure of this problem.",

We thought this might not result in serious biases because of the compensatory effects of coexisting CCS categories. Secondly, because the ICD-9-CM codes in outpatient claims were given by physicians, there might be human errors in coding. Additionally, given that we used the utilization data from 2002 as a reference, it was unlikely that coding errors would differ within 1 year. Thirdly, because we confined our analysis to the 25 most utilized CCS categories, we therefore lost information on changes in utilization amongst many of the other less common CCS categories. Fourthly, a further analyses including age and sex would provide more useful information still on the patients\u2019 perception of necessary and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Fifthly, there were variations in severity of disease within the same category.",

In this study, we touched somewhat on the patients\u2019 aggregate expressions of the value of necessity of going to see a doctor.
