Moreover, the host spectrum of CDV is gradually increasing (Qiu et al., 2011). Currently, vaccination is the most effective means of controlling CD and one of the most frequently used vaccines is a modified live attenuated vaccine. Although widespread vaccination against CD has been conducted for many decades, this infection still represents an important disease for dogs (Elia et al., 2006). There is, therefore, a need for the development of assays that can distinguish dogs vaccinated with modified live attenuated vaccine from those infected with wild-type virus in herds.",

However, the occurrence of false-positive PCR products for each of these methods hinders the identification of wild-type CDV strains (Ralston et al., 2007). Real-time quantitative PCR methods have also been reported to detect CDV. The advantages of real-time PCR, compared with conventional RT-PCR, include higher speed, greater sensitivity, and less handling of PCR products. However, real-time PCR instruments are expensive and may not be readily available in many laboratories (Coleman et al., 2014). Other methods such as serological assays (Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), virus isolation and in situ hybridization have also been developed, but are not applicable for the fast and sensitive diagnosis of CDV (Gray et al., 2012, Gaedke et al., 1997, Rzezutka and Mizak, 2002, Frisk et al., 1999, von Messling et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The success of the RT-LAMP method relies on the specificities of the designed primers for the target RNA sequence. To develop a RT-LAMP method for the specific detection of wild-type CDV variants, we first designed specific primers by targeting the H gene. Under the reaction conditions, the amplification was completed in 45\u201350 min at a constant temperature of 65 \u00b0C. The results demonstrated that the RT-LAMP assay was able to differentiate wild-type CDV isolates from the vaccine strains, with a detection limit of 10\u22121\n TCID50\n ml\u22121 of CDV, and in the absence of cross-reactivity with CAV, CPV, CPIV and CCoV. Furthermore, 102 clinical samples obtained from vaccinated dogs were tested by both RT-LAMP and multiplex nested RT-PCR. Of the samples tested, 13 were positive for both assays. The remaining 89 samples were negative for the RT-LAMP assay, and 87 samples were classified as negative. These results indicate that the specific CDV-H RT-LAMP assay provides a simple, rapid, and sensitive tool for the detection of canines infected with wild-type CDV from canines vaccinated with attenuated vaccine, and has potential use for laboratory and clinical diagnosis practices.",
