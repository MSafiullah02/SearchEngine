In addition, patients with 151 COVID-19 infection are being recruited for randomized trials to evaluate the 152 efficacy of favipiravir plus interferon-\u03b1 (ChiCTR2000029600) and favipiravir 153 plus baloxavir marboxil (ChiCTR2000029544). 154 155 Ribavirin 156 Ribavirin (Bausch Health Companies Inc., Bridgewater, NJ, USA) is a 157 guanosine analogue antiviral drug that has been used to treat several viral 158 infections, including hepatitis C virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 159 some viral hemorrhagic fevers. The in vitro antiviral activity of ribavirin against 160 SARS-CoV was estimated to be at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL. 29 However, it 161 has the undesirable adverse effect of reducing hemoglobin, which is harmful 162 for patients in respiratory distress. 19 benefits of IFNb-1b for SARS patients remains uncertain. inhibitors (PIs) are important agents in the contemporary treatment of 173 patients with chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In the 174 Orthocoronavirinae family, the targets of PIs are papain-like protease and 175 3C-like protease. 30 The antiviral activity of lopinavir (LPV; Abbott Laboratories, 176 Lake Bluff, Illinois, US) against MERS-CoV in a tissue culture model is 177 controversial, despite a good effect in mitigating disease progression in the efficacy of prophylactic remdesivir (25 mg/kg twice a day, administered 1 180 day prior to infection) as well as therapeutic remdesivir with that of 181 LPV/ritonavir (RTV, used to prolong the LPV's half-life)-IFNb combination 182 therapy in a humanized transgenic mouse MERS-CoV infection model.

The role of darunavir (Janssen 202 Additionally, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective 206 against SARS-CoV in patients and in tissue culture. 36 207 208 Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin 209 Chloroquine is active against malaria as well as autoimmune diseases (such 210 as rheumatoid arthritis [RA], lupus erythematosus). It was recently reported as 211 a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug for treatment of viruses such as 212 influenza H 5 N 1 in an animal model. 37 Chloroquine was shown to increase 213 endosomal pH, which prevents virus/cell fusion. It also interferes with the 214 glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV. 38,39 Although the in vitro data 215 SARS-CoV-2 is a completely off-label use. It is not recommended in light of 218 safety concerns (adverse effects on the hematologic, hepatic and renal 219 systems, QTc prolongation with ventricular dysrhythmia) and will likely result in 220 a major shortage of anti-malarial armamentaria. 40 221 values: 0.72 and 5.47 \u03bcM, respectively) and has lower potential for drug-drug 225 interactions than chloroquine. Pharmacokinetic models demonstrate that 226 hydroxychloroquine sulfate is significant superior (5 days in advance) to 227 chloroquine phosphate in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 41 The Taiwan CDC 228 declared hydroxychloroquine as an important anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent on 26 229 March, 2020. Of note, patients with retinopathy, deficiency of 230 glucose-6-phosphatase, QTc prolongation in electrocardiograms, history of 231 allergy to hydroxychloroquine or who are pregnant or breastfeeding are 232 contraindicated for receiving hydroxychloroquine therapy. 42 233 Azithromycin (Pfizer Inc., Manhattan, New York City, NY, USA) was shown 234 to be active in vitro against Ebola viruses. 43 Furthermore, azithromycin is 235 thought to have good potential in preventing severe respiratory tract infections 236 among pre-school children when it is administrated to patients suffering viral 237 infection. 44 According to one recent study, azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, 238 followed by 250 mg per day on day 2-5) was shown to significantly reinforce 239 the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg three times per day for 10 days) in hydroxychloroquine concentration was 0.46\u00b10.20 \u00b5g/mL. The good clinical 242 outcome among these COVID-19 patients was thought to be due to the 243 excellent efficiency of virus elimination after administration of this combination 244 therapy. 42 Consequently, the regimen of hydroxychloroquine in combination 245 with azithromycin might be a promising alternative to remdesivir in the 246 treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future. Nevertheless, 247 the possibility of complicated QTc prolongation should be concerned. 248 249 Teicoplanin and other glycopeptides 250 The other antibiotics worth mentioning in this review are glycopeptides. 251 Teicoplanin (Sanofi Pharmaceuticals, Paris, France) was demonstrated to 252 potently prevent the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the 253 cytoplasm, and also has an inhibitory effect on transcription-as well as 254 replication-competent virus-like particles in the low micromolar range (IC 50 , 255 330 nM). 45 Moreover, teicoplanin is able to block the MERS and SARS 256 envelope pseudotyped viruses as well. 45 Mechanistic investigations revealed 257 that teicoplanin specifically inhibits the activities of host cell's cathepsin L and 258 cathepsin B, which are responsible for cleaving the viral glycoprotein allowing 259 exposure of the receptor-binding domain of its core genome and subsequent 260 release into the cytoplasm of host cells. 46,47 Thus, teicoplanin blocks Ebola 261 virus entry in the late endosomal pathway. These studies indicate the potential 262 role of teicoplanin and its derivatives (dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin) 263 as novel inhibitors of cathepsin L-dependent viruses. 264 A brief summary of the mechanism of action and targets of potential 265 antimicrobial agents against SARS-CoV-2 is shown in Table 1. 266 267 Monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies and other therapies 268 Monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies have been suggested as prophylactic and 269 therapeutic tools (targeting hemagglutinin binding) against some viral 270 infections, such as influenza. 48 Current efforts in developing monoclonal and 271 polyclonal antibodies against coronaviruses mainly target MERS-CoV. 18 For 272 example, a human polyclonal antibody SAB-301 (50 mg/kg) that was 273 generated in transchromosomic cattle was observed to be well tolerated and 274 safe in healthy participants of a phase 1 clinical trial. 49 However, Cockrell et al. 275 (2016) observed that immune-based therapy with human monoclonal 276 antibodies only provided protection against early stage disease caused by is important in mediating viral entry into target cells. Furthermore, the cleavage 280 and subsequent activation of the SARS-CoV spike protein by a protease of the 281 host cell is absolutely essential for infectious viral entry. 51 Type II 282 transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was suggested to be an important 283 host protease that cleaves and activates the SARS-CoV spike protein in cell 284 cultures, and was thus explored as a potential antiviral agent. 18 In the past 285 decade, the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate was shown to inhibit 286 the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2. 52 Additionally, the cysteine PI K11777 287 showed promising potency in inhibiting MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication 288 within the submicromolar range. 53 289 Use of stem cells against COVID-19 has been under evaluation in China 290 recently. Additionally, tocilizumab (Roche Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) 291 is a monoclonal antibody that is used in the treatment of RA exacerbation. It 292 was designed to inhibit the binding of interleukin-6 to its receptors, thus 293 alleviating cytokine release syndrome. Currently, it is also being investigated 294 for treatment of COVID-19infection. 55,56 One possible explanation for the efficacy of convalescent 301 plasma therapy is that the immunoglobulin antibodies in the plasma of patients 302 recovering from viral infection might suppress viremia. Shen et al. (2020) 303 reported on five critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 304 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who received transfusion with 305 convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (binding titer 306 >1:1000 and neutralization titer >40). The convalescent plasma was obtained 307 from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and it was administered to the 308 five enrolled patients between 10 and 22 days after admission. Antiviral agents 309 and methylprednisolone were also administered. Following plasma 310 transfusions, improvements in clinical condition were observed, including 311 normalization of body temperature within 3 days (in 4/5 patients), decrease in 312 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, rise in PaO 2 /FiO 2 , resolution of 313 ARDS (4 patients at 12 days after transfusion), a success of weaning from 314 mechanical ventilation (3 patients within 2 weeks of treatment), and decline in 315 viral loads (became negative within 12 days) and increase in SARS-CoV-2-discharged from the hospital (lengths of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), while 2 318 were in stable condition at 37 days after transfusions. 56 The authors concluded 319 that use of convalescent plasma transfusion is beneficial among patients 320 infected with SARS-CoV-2, even though the sample number in this study is 321 the historical records and anecdotal evidence of SARS and H 1 N 1 325 pdm09 prevention, Chinese herbal drugs were also considered as an 326 alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk populations. 327 However, clinical evidence for these treatments in the prevention of this 328 emerging viral infection is lacking. 57,58 During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, 329 some traditional Chinese medicine was widely used, and the six most rhinovirus, coronavirus, and HIV). Influenza A virus was the commonest 342 co-infective virus. 59 Co-administration of anti-influenza agents and 343 anti-bacterial agents in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was common. 59 344 Consequently, a cautious prescription of effective antibiotic(s) covering 345 Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), 346 multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 347 Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Acinetobacter baumannii species for 348 patients undergoing long hospitalization (> 6 days) is advised. 60,61 349 350 Other considerations and precautions regarding concomitant 351 medication 352 Based on the research of Yang et al. (2020), 62 the most distinctive 353 comorbidities among the non-survivors of COVID-19 in intensive care units observed by Guan et al. (2020); 63 these patients were usually treated with ACE 356 inhibitors or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARB). As mentioned 357 above, 5,12 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can bind to their target cells through 358 ACE2 receptors expressed by the epithelial cells of lung, intestine and 359 kidney. 64 Consequently, careful administration of an ACE inhibitor or ARB for 360 patients with SARS-CoV infection in the absence of ARDS is advised. 361 Additionally, despite conflicting advice from the US Food and Drug 362 Administration, 65 the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 363 such as ibuprofen, was thought to be likely to result in an induction of 364 increased ACE2 receptors. 66 For critically ill adults with COVID-19 who 365 develop fever, acetaminophen might be a better choice for temperature control 366 than NSAIDs. 67 Of note, according to a study by Wu et al. (2020), treatment of 367 COVID-19 patients with methylprednisolone was shown to decrease the 368 case-fatality risk (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72). 68 However, the administered 369 dose of methylprednisolone is not specified in that investigation. Despite a lack 370 of supporting evidence, some critical care experts advocate the use of 371 low-dose corticosteroid therapy in adults with COVID-19 and refractory shock 372 Moreover, a recent report by Tang et al. (2020) demonstrated that 375 anticoagulant therapy with heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin) 376 was associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients. The 377 28-day mortality of heparin users was lower than that of non-users among 378 patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy scores \u22654 (40.0% vs. 64.2%, 379 P=0.029), or D-dimer > 6-fold the upper limit of normal (32.8% vs. 52.4%, 380 P=0.017). 69 381 Finally, high ACE2 activity is associated with reduced severity of ARDS 382 among patients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV. 70 Fedson 383 et al. (2016, 2020) observed that statins target the host response to infection 384 (endothelial dysfunction) rather than the virus itself, and suggested that 385 combination therapy with ARB and statins might accelerate a return to 386 homeostasis, allowing patients to recover on their own. summary, we are facing a terrible virus with greater infectivity than the 390 SARS-CoV pandemic of 2003. There is presently no vaccine or documented 391 specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug regimen to treat critically ill patients. Most of 22 the potential drugs for treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated for safety 393 and efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is the most promising agent. In 394 addition, favipiravir and combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus 395 azithromycin appear to be acceptable alternatives for treatment of COVID-19 396 patients. For patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE inhibitor and ARB need 397 to be prescribed with caution. Compared with NSAIDs, acetaminophen might 398 be a safer agent for treating fever in COVID-19 patients. Finally, low-dose 399 steroid (hydrocortisone) might be prescribed for treatment of refractory shock 400 in patients with COVID-19.

Median time to clinical 190 improvement in both cases was 16 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% 191 confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.85; P=0.09) and there was no difference in 192 the reduction of viral RNA loading for severe SARS-CoV-2 patients. 32 193 Despite discouraging results, it is intriguing that a slightly lower number of 194 deaths was observed in the group receiving LPV/RTV in the late stage of 195 SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the standard-care group. Moreover, 196 Baden and Ruben (2020) and Sheahan et al.
