            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) is a nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the ebolavirus genus in the family Filoviridae. These viruses are highly pathogenic and cause Ebola virus disease (EVD), previously referred to as Ebola hemorrhagic fever with case fatality rates up to 90% (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011, Feldmann and Kiley, 1999). During 2014\u20132016, West Africa experienced the largest EBOV outbreak in history that resulted in over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths (Coltart et al., 2017). Alarmingly, the most recent EBOV-Kivu outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has a reported 3,224 confirmed and probable cases of EVD and 2,152 deaths as of October 16, 2019 and does not currently show signs of abating (https://www.who.int/csr/don/02-may-2019-ebola-drc/en/). Currently, there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat EVD; this fact combined with these unprecedented outbreaks in recent years underscores the urgent need to develop a wide variety of effective treatment strategies.",

            "text": "The current armamentarium of treatment options against EBOV primarily consists of small molecules and immunotherapeutics (Edwards and Basler, 2019, King et al., 2019). Of the reported small molecules that demonstrate anti-EBOV activity, the nucleoside analogs BXC4430, GS-5734, and Favipriravir have shown anti-EBOV activity in in vivo infection models (Bixler et al., 2018, Warren et al., 2014, Warren et al., 2016). Similarly, numerous reports have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are effective at inhibiting infection (Brannan et al., 2019, Furuyama et al., 2016, Howell et al., 2017, King et al., 2019, Marzi et al., 2012, Pettitt et al., 2013, Qiu et al., 2012, Audet et al., 2014). These MAbs target the EBOV glycoprotein (GP), which acts as an attachment factor, binding the host receptor Neimann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and mediating viral-host cell membrane fusion within the endosomal compartment (Davey et al., 2017, Carette et al., 2011, Cote et al., 2011, Hunt et al., 2012). Prior to receptor engagement, GP is cleaved by host cathepsins (Cat) B and L (Chandran et al., 2005, Schornberg et al., 2006). Cleavage of GP by CatB is required for GP-NPC1 binding and subsequent endosomal fusion (Miller et al., 2012). As a result, targeting GP endosomal processing and receptor binding can serve as an effective method of EBOV inhibition. Indeed, inhibitors of CatB/L or blockade of GP-NPC1 binding have shown efficacy against EBOV infection (Carette et al., 2011, Chandran et al., 2005, Elshabrawy et al., 2014, Herbert et al., 2015, Schornberg et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs, also called host defense peptides) serve as an essential component of the innate immune system, in part, owing to their pleiotropic functions in microbial killing, inflammation, and wound healing (Nakatsuji and Gallo, 2012). The two major AMP families in mammalian cells are the defensins and the cationic cathelicidin peptides (Lehrer and Ganz, 2002a, Lehrer and Ganz, 2002b, Zanetti et al., 1995). Although there are multiple defensin genes, there is only one known cathelicidin gene in humans (Lehrer and Ganz, 2002a, Sorensen et al., 1997). The human cathelicidin, hCAP-18, is abundantly expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, and epithelial cells of skin and mucosal membranes (Agerberth et al., 2000, Sorensen et al., 1997). hCAP-18 is stored as an inactive precursor and upon stimulation is processed to generate the active peptide LL-37 (Sorensen et al., 2001). Interestingly, besides its broad anti-bacterial property, LL-37 can also inhibit several viruses, including Influenza A virus, human rhinovirus, human adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (Bergman et al., 2007, Currie et al., 2013, Uchio et al., 2013, Sousa et al., 2017). Recently, it has been demonstrated that LL-37-derived AMPs inhibit Zika virus infection, although the mechanisms are not well defined (He et al., 2018). Nevertheless, these studies suggest LL-37 AMPs can serve as viable anti-viral therapeutics.",

Here we used a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) expressing EBOV-GP and green fluorescence protein (rVSV-EBOVgp-GFP, in short, VSV-eGP) as an experimental system to test the effects of AMPs on EBOV-GP-mediated infection. Initially, we screened 20 AMPs including the parent human LL-37 and its engineered variants. We found that two engineered LL-37 variant peptides 17BIPHE2 (in short 17BI) and GI-20d were most potent in inhibiting VSV-eGP infection (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to focus on these two peptides and the relevant control peptides in this study (listed in Figure 1\n). The parent LL-37 peptide was included as a baseline control. Peptides GF-17 and GI-20 containing the native sequences for 17BI and GI-20d, respectively, were derived from the major antimicrobial region of LL-37 (Li et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Peptide 17BI was engineered with three D-form amino acids and two biphenylalanines based on the sequence of GF-17 (Wang et al., 2014). GI-20d is a novel peptide engineered with all D-form amino acids with identical sequence to GI-20. Peptide RI-10 is an inactive LL-37 derivative with only 10 amino acids, serving as a negative control (Wang, 2008).",

CD14+ monocytes were freshly purified from human blood samples and differentiated to macrophages by treatment with macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (Murray et al., 2014). Macrophages were then infected with VSV-eGP together with mAb 13C6 or AMPs. Similar to the results in HeLa cells, all the AMPs (except the RI-10 negative control) displayed dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-eGP infection in macrophages (Figure 2C). Peptides 17BI and GI-20d were the most potent and almost completely inhibited VSV-eGP infection in macrophages at 10 \u03bcM (Figure 2C). We next determined the half-maximal concentration of inhibition (IC50) and half-maximal concentration of cell toxicity (TC50) of these AMPs in HeLa cells and primary macrophages. All the AMPs displayed lower IC50 concentrations in HeLa cells than in macrophages, although they also displayed slightly lower TC50 concentrations in HeLa cells than in macrophages (Figure 2D). Among the parent LL-37 and its engineered variants, peptide GI-20d had the most favorable therapeutic window in both HeLa cells and primary macrophages (with an IC50 of 0.99 \u03bcM and TC50 of 18.8 \u03bcM in HeLa cells and an IC50 of 2.2 \u03bcM and TC50 of more than 30 \u03bcM in macrophages). Peptide 17BI also had a favorable therapeutic window with an IC50 of 0.71 \u03bcM and TC50 of 13.2 \u03bcM in HeLa cells and an IC50 of 5.6 \u03bcM and TC50 of more than 30 \u03bcM in macrophages (Figure 2D). We also examined the effects of AMPs on VSV-eGP infection in Vero cells, a cell line commonly used for propagating viruses and in analyzing virus infection. Similarly, the parent LL-37 and its engineered variants (except the negative control RI-10) displayed dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-eGP infection in Vero cells (Figures S1A and S1B). In agreement with our findings in HeLa cells and primary macrophages, 17BI and GI-20d were the most potent peptides in inhibition of VSV-eGP infection in Vero cells.

Pre-treatment of macrophages with 17BI and GI-20d for 4 h prior to viral infection blocked VSV-eGP infection with similar efficacy (Figure 4A). However, delayed treatment of macrophages with 17BI and GI-20d peptides resulted in a time-dependent reduction of effects, with approximately 20% of inhibition when added at 4 h post infection and a complete loss of inhibition when added at 8 h post infection (Figure 4A). These data suggested that engineered AMP peptides may target the early cell entry stage of EBOV infection. Similar results were observed for Vero cells (Figure S1C).",

We postulated that AMPs composed of L-amino acids are more susceptible to degradation by proteolytic enzymes inside cells, thus reducing their availability to block CatB in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the AMPs were susceptible to CatS cleavage in an in vitro reaction. CatS was used because it is the most abundant cathepsin in the endosome/lysosome of macrophages and LL-37 has been shown to be an excellent substrate of CatS (Shi et al., 1992, Andrault et al., 2015). All the AMPs composed of L-amino acids only (LL-37, GF-17, GI-20, and RI-10) were completely degraded by CatS treatment in the reaction, whereas AMPs containing D-amino acids (17BI and GI-20d) were resistant to CatS cleavage (Figure 6\nA). The data indicate that AMPs composed of L-amino acids are susceptible to degradation by CatS upon entering cells. We then hypothesized that blockage of CatS may stabilize these AMPs inside cells, thus making them available to inhibit CatB-mediated EBOV entry. To test the hypothesis, Vero cells were pre-treated with a CatS inhibitor for 2 h, followed by the addition of AMPs and VSV-eGP. CatS inhibitor treatment significantly improved the efficacy of LL-37, GF-17, and GI-20 by 4- to 10-fold in their inhibition of VSV-eGP infection (Figure 6B). Notably, CatS inhibitor also improved the efficacy of 17BI and GI-20d by 1.5- to 2-fold and CatS inhibitor treatment alone resulted in 30% inhibition of VSV-eGP infection, likely due to the known ability of the inhibitor to cross-inhibit CatB.",
