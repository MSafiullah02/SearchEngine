Children affected are commonly 5 to 12 years old, and the incidence is estimated to be 12.8/100,000 patient years.4 It is also a relatively common complaint in the adult population, with an incidence of 4.7/100,000 patient years.4\n",

It includes the tonsils, thus making tonsillar infections a specific subsite of the oropharynx. Superiorly, it extends from the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall, where it is separated from the nasopharynx. Inferiorly, its boundary is the hyoid bone to the posterior pharyngeal wall, where it lies above the hypopharynx (Figure 16-1\n). The major subsites of the oropharynx include the soft palate/uvula, tongue base, tonsils, and lateral/posterior pharyngeal walls.11\n",

Acute infections often occur in younger populations, but when they do occur in adults, the organisms are often different and the strains have a tendency to be more resistant to treatment with different disease manifestations.4., 22. Asking whether someone has been exposed to a sick contact may help the clinician to diagnose an infection, but it does not necessarily indicate the causative organism. Many of the symptoms of sore throat, fever, fatigue, and dysphagia are overlapping. It is important to ask how long the symptoms have been present and whether episodes are recurrent, because these are key points that can alert the physician to the source of infection and the need for different management. Timing and seasonality of the symptoms can also be helpful in determining a specific organism.

Often GAS infections appear with sore throat without cough.10 Clinicians have tried to create a set of clinical criteria to help diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis, but its utility is uncertain. These criteria, the Centor criteria, include a four-point scoring scale based on signs and symptoms suggestive of GAS bacterial pharyngitis. This scoring system has been shown to have a high negative predictive value in some reports (81%), as opposed to its positive predictive value (48%).5 Some studies show that even patients with all four criteria have less than a 60% chance of having a positive throat culture, which is the gold standard for diagnosis.1 The utility of a scoring system in making a diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is that it helps to stratify patients into high, medium, or low probability of having the disease. These criteria are used to guide further workup and should be used with additional diagnostic information to confirm GAS.1., 5. The use of these criteria alone can lead to an incorrect diagnosis of GAS and can increase the use of unnecessary antibiotics. It is important to note that GAS often manifests differently in children/adolescents and adults; therefore, the criteria do not necessarily apply equally to all patients. However, there is a newer scoring system that accounts for a patient\u2019s age (Table 16-2\n).",

If four of the Centor criteria are met, it has been suggested that empiric treatment for GAS can be started or RADT can be performed.1 The RADT is a throat swab that is used to detect cell wall carbohydrate antigens with specific enzyme-immunoassay antibodies.10., 12. The sensitivities of this test range from 70 to 90%1., 10., 12.; however, the specificity of this test is extremely high at greater than 95%.1., 7., 10. Thus, patients who have a positive RADT and symptoms of pharyngitis should have antibiotic therapy initiated. Patients without any symptoms do not need to be tested because a positive test without symptoms would indicate carrier status as opposed to being acutely infected. The diagnostic ability of the test increases if there is a greater likelihood of the patient having GAS pharyngitis.7 If a RADT result is negative, then a throat culture should be used for a more definitive test. Throat culture is ultimately the gold standard by which the diagnosis of GAS pharyngotonsillitis is made. The throat swab for culture needs to be collected from the surface of the pharynx or tonsils, because collections from other sites in the oral cavity reduce diagnostic accuracy.1., 10. When this algorithm is used, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are both greater than 95%,1 and it is the most cost-effective management10 (Figure 16-4\n).",

Although viral causes are more common, the bacterial causes often require a more involved workup because failure to treat them can have more severe consequences. Viral causes are treated with supportive care, but particular care should be taken not to overlook EBV and HIV as potential viral organisms causing pharyngitis. GAS pharyngitis is the most common bacterial cause of oropharyngeal infection. Fast and accurate diagnosis of GAS is essential because antibiotic therapy will help to prevent both suppurative and nonsuppurative complications. This diagnosis can be facilitated with rapid antigen detection test and confirmed with throat culture. Once the causative organism is identified, prompt initiation of antibiotics with either penicillin or cephalosporin should be started. For recurrent infections or suppurative complications, surgical intervention should be given consideration as well. For the clinician, the balance must be weighed between treating promptly and being too aggressive and increasing antibiotic resistance. This area of study will continue to make acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis a topic of discussion in the future.\n",
