The foundation of the economy is the livestock sector, which is based mainly on extensive production of sheep, goats, cattle, horses and camels on pastures. The system for breeding domestic animals in Mongolia is very different to that in other countries. Since animal husbandry is based on a nomadic lifestyle, domestic and wild animals are frequently in both direct and indirect contact, the latter because they share the same pastures and water sources. Thus cross infection can easily occur, not only among horses, but also between horses and other animals.",

Positive reactors were found in many provinces, 45 (15.0%) of the 300 horse sera being positive, but none were detected in Dornod and Khentii provinces (Table 2), possibly because there were few test sera from these provinces. EAV cannot be differentiated clinically from a number of other respiratory and systemic equine viral diseases such as equine influenza, EHV\u20101 and 4 and equine adenovirus infections (7, 14). The disease also has clinical similarities to toxicosis caused by hoary alyssum. Therefore, outbreaks of this disease have been misdiagnosed as other illnesses and not correctly identified as EAV infections. It is not clear whether the virus originated in Mongolia or came from Europe. Since many horses were sent from Mongolia to Europe during World War II, some of them might have been infected with the virus there and subsequently taken it back to Mongolia. If, in the future, EAV is again isolated from a horse in Mongolia its origin will become clear genetically or serologically. This is the first report of the presence of EAV among horses in Mongolia.",

No information about vaccination of the horses from which sera were collected was available. There was a big outbreak of equine influenza in Mongolia from the autumn of 2007 (15). The horse sera studied in this serological survey were collected by March 2007. The low rate of antibody\u2010positivity present at that time would have been an important factor in the later epidemic of the disease.",

Furthermore, the seropositive horses did not have high antibody titers to JEV. West Nile virus, which cross\u2010reacts with JEV, is present in Siberia (19).
