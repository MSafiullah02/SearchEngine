This maneuver creates a vulnerable AGMP. To minimize risk, we suggest 2 options (Figure). Bussi\u00e8res et al4 have published stepwise approaches to expedite lung deflation with bronchial blockers; they also suggested the possibility that maintaining a closed port to the operative side (Figure, panel A) of the DLT, while clamping the appropriate lumen for OLV, could increase resorption atelectasis by eliminating dilution of intra-alveolar O2 with ambient air.5 The benefit of this method is maintenance of a closed system. Alternatively, to open the operative DLT lumen to atmosphere with the clamp applied, a second filter should be added to the now \u201copen\u201d airway (Figure, panel B). Application of suction to the operative lung to expedite lung collapse can be considered with acknowledgement of inherent risks. To prevent environmental contamination with a soiled FOB, we have adjusted practice to keep it immediately available, but in a container separate from the FOB tower.",
