Overall, human social and economic activities have more significant impacts on river discharge in the northern arid regions of China and have limited impacts in the humid southern areas. For example, human social and economic activities are the major reasons for the decreased discharge in the middle reaches of the Yellow River since 1970. Climatic factors have increasingly contributed to reduced river discharge since the 1980s. Climate change and human social and economic activities accounted for ~30 and 70 % reduction in river discharge, respectively. Climate change exacerbated at some extent the contradiction between water supply and demand in the arid regions of northern China.",

River segments with water quality worse than the V standard accounted for 21 % of the total river segments, an increase of 4 % compared with 2001. The rapid development of regional industrial and agricultural activities contributed to the deterioration of water quality, but climate change also had an effect on hydrology. Higher air temperatures effected the biological environment of rivers and lakes, and the distribution of water organisms, particularly in water bodies prone to cyanobacteria or eutrophication. On the other hand, reduced precipitation and reduced discharge due to industrial and agricultural development decreased the ability of rivers to dilute toxins. As a result, water-quality problems have led to more prominent water shortages in the southern, humid regions of China.",

The recent increased glacial runoff into the Yangtze River partly compensated for the decrease in the river\u2019s discharge. Intensification of glacier ablation and shrinkage has led to the areal expansion of some lakes that are mainly supplied by glacial runoff. In recent years, the frequency of glacier floods and glacial lake outburst floods has increased. Given differences of glacier coverage and glacier changes in each watershed, the impacts of glacial runoff on water resources still need further research, particularly the impact of the process of glacial runoff decrease after increasing during glacier retreat on river runoff needs refinement.",

Another prominent phenomenon in Chinese coastal waters is the salinity of the Bohai Sea. The average salinity of the entire Bohai Sea has increased nearly 2 Psu (salinity unit) from 1961 to 1996. The salinity near the old estuary of the Yellow River in Bohai Bay has increased nearly 10 Psu, mainly caused by the reduction of Yellow River discharge to the Bohai Sea, and increased evaporation (Wu et al. 2004). The evaporation of the East China Sea has significantly increased, by ~1.2 cm/year, which has led to continuing loss of freshwater and heat, while the freshwater flux of the South China Sea has weakened, leading to decreased endothermic conditions from 1979 to 2008.",

Sea-level rise leads to aggravated coastal erosion, which has increased significantly since the 1950s. The majority of sandy shores, muddy shores, and coral reefs changed from deposition or stable states to erosional states, and total erosion increased. The average coastal erosion rate is 15\u201320 m/a from 1976 to 1982 in Hainan Island. Sea-level rise has increased coastal water depths, enhanced wave action, and intensified storm surges. Rising sea level has led to estuarine saltwater wedges upstream, increasing the intensity of seawater intrusion into rivers and aggravating groundwater salinization. This phenomenon is particularly evident near the deltas of major Chinese rivers. Seawater intrusion is more pronounced in coastal cities close to the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. Laizhou Bay, in Shandong Province, is one of the regions with the most serious seawater intrusion in China. The rate of intrusion has increased from 46 m/year during 1976\u20131979 to 404.5 m/year during 1987\u20131988 in this region. The sea-level rise has significant effects on salinity traced in Pearl River Delta. The traced distance of 250 mg/L of salinity line significantly increased with the upstream runoff frequency increases. The boundary of salinity traced back to the upstream significantly moved under certain upstream runoff conditions and the rise in sea level (Kong et al. 2010).",

Annual precipitation has increased significantly in most eastern and northwestern parts of the karst areas in southwestern China, while precipitation in the middle and southwestern karst areas has significantly decreased. However, even in those regions with decreased annual precipitation, rainfall in flood season has increased, due to extreme rainstorms. Spatial patterns of precipitation are the main factors affecting the regional development of rocky desertification. Heavy rains in the karst mountain areas in southwestern China are more concentrated in the spring (~40 %) and summer (50 %) seasons for the cultivation of crops in these areas. (2) Climate change has caused vegetation degradation in the karst areas. The regional NDVI for most parts of northern Guangxi and eastern and southwest Yunnan provinces has decreased, accompanied by temperature increases over the past 20 years. The decrease in annual average NDVI is more pronounced in the northern Guangxi region. There is a significant negative correlation between temperature and vegetation index.

High winds, dust storms, drought, and other extreme climate even negatively affect the growth of grass and result in a decline of pasture. More droughts strengthen the potential desertification of semiarid areas increased droughts in steppe regions, and longer droughts, which further reduce soil fertility, reduce the yield of grasslands, decrease the pasture cover, decrease the yield of forage, and decrease the grassland carrying capacity and stocking rates. On the other hand, climate warming, especially an increase in the average cold-season air temperature, favors the overwintering and reproduction of rats and other pests, leading to plant reduction and an increase in livestock epidemics.

Rising winter and spring temperatures and a reduction of snow-covered areas have reduced the snowstorm hazard in pastoral areas and benefited to livestock survival in winter and spring.

High-speed rails need to take measures to adapt to the impacts of climate change and focus on prevention of meteorological disasters in the key seasons and areas. South transmission line had been experienced serious loss in the 2008 snow and ice storms. Accompanied by the projected increasing in the probability of extreme weather events, south transmission lines need to strengthen prevention and protection on freezing rain, improve disaster warning, and other measures, enhancing the ability to adapt to climate change.",
