Pasteurization has proven itself to be a highly effective step, in combination with other complementary safety measures, toward assuring the virus safety of final product. S tudies on inactivation of viruses in biologics were initially triggered after 23,000 cases of hepatitis were reported in US Armed Forces personnel in 1942 associated with the administration of certain lots of yellow fever vaccine, stabilized with non-heattreated human serum. 1 Subsequently, the effectiveness of From 1 Global Pathogen Safety, CSL Behring GmbH, Marburg, pasteurization as a virus inactivation technique was clinically demonstrated in human volunteers who received either a pasteurized or non-heat-treated dose of human serum albumin (HSA) spiked with plasma containing infectious hepatitis B virus (HBV). Subjects who received the pasteurized HBV-spiked HSA displayed no clinical signs of infection, as monitored by liver function assays, in contrast to the subjects who received the non-heattreated HBV-spiked HSA. 2 As plasma fractionation techniques improved, coagulation factors, immunoglobulins, and enzyme inhibitor concentrates were isolated at industrial scale from large volumes of pooled plasma. Although these therapeutic products provided life-saving and lifesustaining therapeutic options for patients, they also intermittently transmitted blood-borne viruses, 3,4 especially HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Therefore, methods that had a high capacity to inactivate and/or remove viruses were integrated in the industrial manufacturing process of plasmaderived products. The first reliable virus inactivation method, pasteurization (heat treatment in aqueous solution at 608C for 10 hr), to effectively inactivate HBV and HCV (at that time called non-A/non-B hepatitis virus) in coagulation factor concentrates was studied and implemented at Behringwerke (a predecessor company of CSL Behring) in the late 1970s and early 1980s by employing suitable stabilizers and conditions to permit pasteurization without modifying the product, for example, formation of neoantigens or activated factors. As no cell culture assay system for HBV and non-A/non-B hepatitis virus was available, the capacity of the pasteurization step to inactivate these hepatitis viruses was assessed in chimpanzees 5 or in ducklings. 6 After HIV was known to be transmitted by blood transfusion and some plasma-derived products, studies were performed using cell culture systems to document the heat sensitivity of HIV. 7 Hemovigilance studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the pasteurization step introduced in the manufacturing process of a Factor (F)VIII/von Willebrand factor (FVIII/ VWF) concentrate to prevent the transmission of HBV, HCV (non-A/non-B hepatitis virus), 8 and HIV 9 at the time when HCV was not a known characterized virus 10 and when no donor screening assays were available for HIV. 11, 12 Virus validation guidelines were ultimately developed and issued by the European authorities, requiring manufacturers to carry out studies to demonstrate the capacity, reliability, and effectiveness of the manufacturing processes to inactivate and/or remove viruses potentially present in the starting material (plasma pool for fractionation). [13] [14] [15] These guidelines required a systematic evaluation of the virus reduction potential of manufacturing process steps in virus validation studies employing relevant and model viruses with a wide range of physicochemical properties.",

            "text": "The overall results demonstrate that, under the specific conditions optimized for and implemented in each manufacturing process, pasteurization is a highly robust and broadly effective virus inactivation step. Heat inactivation methods such as pasteurization and dry heat treatment thermally destabilize the intermolecular interactions between virus capsid proteins (and/or the integrity of the virus envelope where relevant) thereby resulting in a loss of virion capsid structural integrity and virus infectivity. 17 This contrasts to solvent/detergent or caprylate (octanoic acid) inactivation methods that destabilize or destroy the lipid envelope only, not the virus capsid, and are therefore effective for enveloped viruses only. 15 Pasteurization effectively (>4 log) inactivated all family members of enveloped viruses studied, evaluated under both target and robustness conditions. All enveloped viruses, except PRV, were inactivated to below the LOD at time points before the 10-hour production minimum, providing a margin of safety and indicating that the true virus inactivation capacity of the step was likely higher than represented by the log RFs that were demonstrated in the virus validation studies. PRV, a model for herpes viruses and other large DNA enveloped viruses, was also effectively inactivated by pasteurization but with slower inactivation kinetics and the presence of residual infectivity. The slower kinetic rates of PRV inactivation was directly related to sucrose concentration, which illustrates the balance between virus inactivation and protection of therapeutic protein activity; high sucrose concentrations were only employed in processes when required to preserve therapeutic protein functionality. Human herpes viruses studied were inactivated faster than PRV, verifying the use of PRV as a worse-case model virus in virus validation studies. It should be noted that PRV and herpesviruses are large and, therefore, effectively removed by small-(15-20 nm) and large-pore (35-75 nm) virus filtration, partitioned by fractionation steps, and are susceptible to other inactivation steps (e.g., Dichtelm\u20ac uller et al. 18, 19 ) . Nonenveloped viruses are susceptible to inactivation by pasteurization. HAV was reliably and effectively inactivated by heat treatment in albumin and in stabilized product intermediates, in line with published data. 6, 16 However, the HAV strain HM 175, substrain 24a, is reported to have a higher heat sensitivity than other substrains, at least when pasteurized in albumin. 20, 21 Studies using the more heat-resistant HAV substrain 18f demonstrate no or little impact on inactivation kinetics for sucrose stabilized product intermediates (data not shown, manuscript in preparation). Only the nonenveloped animal parvoviruses, CPV and MVM, showed broad resistance to heat treatment (1-1.5 log), whereas a slightly higher virus RF of up to 3 log was achieved in the presence of immunoglobulins. Interaction between immunoglobulins and the virus may result in destabilization of the virus capsid, similar to that which is described for heat treatment of human parvoviruses. 22 In contrast, the human pathogenic parvovirus B19V is effectively inactivated in most product intermediates, consistent with previous data. 17, 22 An exception is the ATIII intermediate where high sucrose and CaCl 2 concentrations may be the factors that stabilize B19V; this is in line with Boschetti et al. 23 Virus reduction steps within biologic manufacturing processes are an important part of the broad and complementary safety measures by serving as a proactive measure against emerging viruses not screened for and which may be asymptomatic in donors. The broad effectiveness of pasteurization against emerging viruses and other viruses of concern has been evaluated in a multitude of virus validation studies that confirm that pasteurized plasma-derived products can be considered safe regarding these \"emerging\" viruses. Pasteurization is effective against the flaviviruses WNV and YFV, 24 coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, TGEV), influenzaviruses (H1N1, H5N1), a bunyavirus (LACV), and togaviruses (SINV, SFV) (Fig. 4) , which is consistent with published data for TBEV, 25 Chikungunya virus, 26 and ZIKV. 24, 27 Notably, BVDV used as a standard model virus for HCV in virus validation TBEV and YFV studies was demonstrated to be more heat stable than most of the emerging viruses (Fig. 4) and therefore confirms the use of BVDV as a worse-case model virus for these arboviruses and provides confidence other arthropod-borne viruses such as, for example, Dengue virus, would also be effectively inactivated.",

These measures include licensed blood and plasma collection centers with appropriate epidemiology regarding HIV, HCV, and HBV in plasma donors, 32 mandatory and voluntary testing of all donations for these viruses as well as for HAV and high titers of B19V, 33 releasing plasma pools for fractionation for further manufacturing only when nonreactive for virus markers (and not exceeding 10 4 B19V DNA IU/mL), and the implementation of effective virus reduction steps in the manufacturing process of plasma-derived products. 15 Based on these measures the risk of transmitting blood-borne viruses via the administration of plasma-derived products is very remote. As demonstrated by the breadth of studies presented herein, pasteurization is a highly effective virus inactivation step that provides an effective and robust safety measure against both known and emerging enveloped and nonenveloped viruses.",
