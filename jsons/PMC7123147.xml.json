The impact of infection with respiratory viruses and the subsequent development of severe lower respiratory tract disease has been increasingly appreciated as respiratory viruses become more readily detectable. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are among the best-documented respiratory viruses causing a wide range of respiratory disease in transplant recipients, ranging from asymptomatic shedding to fatal respiratory failure. Understanding the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of RSV and hMPV permits clinicians to intervene pretransplant, provide appropriate infection control and prevention measures, potentially treat patients, and manage immunosuppressive therapy.",

In the later twentieth century, episodes of acute upper respiratory infection (URI) and LRTI without an identified etiology were often considered to be \u201cidiopathic\u201d pneumonia or attributed to regimen-related toxicity or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the classic 1982 study of 215 non-bacterial, non-fungal pneumonias in 525 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, 44% of the episodes of pneumonia remained undiagnosed. The overall mortality rate associated with idiopathic pneumonia in these HSCT recipients was 60%, a strikingly high figure [1]. The potential morbidity of RSV infections was first recognized in immunocompromised children in the 1970s, more than a decade earlier than in immunocompromised adults [2\u20136]. The recognition of respiratory viruses as an important clinical problem likely reflects the increasing number of severely immunodeficient patients, more aggressive attempts to identify the cause of respiratory illness in high-risk patients, and the increasing ability of clinical virology and pathology laboratories to identify respiratory viruses in clinical specimens.",

These same viruses are also a common cause of respiratory disease in transplant recipients [8\u201315]. With the widespread availability of sensitive and reliable molecular diagnostic methods, RSV and hMPV have been detected worldwide in transplant recipients and shown to be common causes of respiratory disease in the immunocompromised host [16, 17]. In both the general population as well as in transplant recipients, RSV and hMPV may produce a wide constellation of clinical syndromes ranging from the common cold to bronchiolitis to severe pneumonia, but in contrast to the general population, RSV and hMPV may significantly impact the morbidity and mortality of the transplant recipient.",

            "text": "RSV was first identified in 1956 and became appreciated as a major cause of epidemic bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children in the 1960s [18, 19]. HMPV was first identified in 2001 by molecular techniques in symptomatic children by van den Hoogen et al. as a paramyxovirus causing bronchiolitis and URI in children [20]. Both viruses are classified within the Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family of non-segmented, negative-strand, enveloped RNA viruses [21]. HMPV belongs to the Metapneumovirus genus whereas RSV is a member of the Pneumovirus genus. Both viruses are highly pleomorphic and their sizes vary from 150 to 600 nm. The RSV and hMPV genomes are approximately 13\u201315 kb in length and closely resemble each other, excluding a few differences in the order of the genes and the absence of the non-structural genes (NS1 and NS2) from hMPV genome. The remaining eight genes code for nine proteins present in both viruses: the nucleoprotein (N protein), the phosphoprotein (P protein), the matrix protein (M protein), the fusion glycoprotein (F protein), the putative transcription factor (M2-1 protein), the RNA synthesis regulatory factor (the M2-2 protein), the small hydrophobic glycoprotein (SH protein), the attachment glycoprotein (G protein) and the viral polymerase (L protein). The RNA core of the virion is associated with P, N, L, M2-1, M2-2 proteins, surrounded by M protein and covered by a lipid envelope. F is the most highly conserved of the envelope glycoproteins within each virus and between RSV and hMPV. The fusion glycoprotein is essential in promoting attachment and fusion of the virus with the cell membrane during viral entry. The fusion protein is the target of many vaccines under development as well as that of monoclonal antibodies such as palivizumab, which is used to prevent RSV disease in preterm infants. By contrast, the G gene is the most variable. Whole genome analysis of both RSV and hMPV has shown the existence of two genotypes, A and B. In hMPV, those two major genetic groups are further divided into subgroups A1, A2, B1, B2 based upon the sequence variability of the G and F genes. Subgroup A2 is again divided into A2a and A2b.",

Next-generation sequencing is a very promising tool to characterize RSV or hMPV strains during severe infection. This could provide information on phylogenicity to identify outbreaks and also detect mutations that could be associated with antiviral or monoclonal resistance as well as increased virulence. Some human gene alleles in the human genome may increase RSV severity in infants, but little is known yet on these genomic variations in transplant recipients. Next-generation sequencing has the potential to provide information on the virus and the human genomes simultaneously.",

At the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Hutch), a prospective surveillance study conducted in 1987 documented respiratory viral infections in 15 (19%) of 78 immunocompromised patients who were followed until hospital discharge [13]; five (33%) patients developed pneumonia and two (13%) patients died (one with RSV, the other with adenovirus). A subsequent prospective surveillance study described 127 viral infections and revealed an overall frequency of viral infections of approximately 4% [11]; 49% of RSV isolates were from BAL.

At the Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, a prospective surveillance study conducted among HSCT recipients between 1989 and 1996 detected 39 (7.1%) respiratory viral infections in 545 patients, including RSV in 21% [14]. At M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), prospective surveillance conducted using culture techniques among hospitalized adult HSCT recipients during two 6-month winter periods detected 67 (31%) respiratory viral infections in 217 hospitalized patients with acute respiratory symptom. Nearly half of these were due to RSV (33 patients, 49%). The impact of these illnesses was considerable: 20 (61%) patients had RSV infection progressing to pneumonia, and 12 patients with RSV pneumonia died. During the winter period when community viruses were frequent and nosocomial transmission was high, the frequency and mortality of respiratory viral-associated pneumonias was more than four times as high as CMV-associated pneumonia.",

RSV infections in lung transplant recipients have also been associated with organ rejection and progressive bronchiolitis obliterans, both of which have been observed to be seasonally related [58, 59]. Adult renal transplant recipients have also been reported to develop RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease.

Another prospective study found hMPV infection as frequent as RSV after lung transplantation, and to cause as much pneumonia and acute allograft dysfunction (63% vs. 72%, respectively), but only RSV was associated with chronic allograft dysfunction at 6 months [76]. In another study, 25% of hMPV infections in lung transplant recipients were associated with acute allograft dysfunction compared with 88% for RSV [49]. A meta-analysis of hMPV respiratory infections and allograft rejection, among lung transplantation recipients indicated that detection of hMPV from airway secretions may be a significant posttransplantation occurrence. A total of 2883 samples from 1007 lung transplant recipients, were analyzed for virus detection; 337 samples had viruses identified and 57 (17%) were positive for hMPV. Twenty of these 57 (35%) cases of hMPV had acute rejection within 3 months of viral detection. There were five (9.4%) cases of chronic rejection in association with hMPV. All studies included in the meta-analysis, with the exception of one, identified rejection within 3 months. Another study has also described cases of chronic rejection within 6 months [77].",

RSV infections in HSCT recipients typically follow the same clinical sequence as RSV infections in previously healthy children: signs and symptoms of a URI such as rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, sore throat, or otitis media frequently precede signs of lower respiratory tract disease including cough, wheezing, hypoxia, and pneumonia [5, 6, 9] (Tables 31-3 and 31-4). The presence of wheezing with respiratory symptoms during the respiratory virus season may provide the clue that RSV may be present. Progression of URI to LRI has been associated with patients who are early (<1 month) posttransplant, those with lymphopenia, or those who are more severely immunosuppressed. In HSCT patients who have recently engrafted, the frequency of progression to LRI tract disease ranges from 25% to 40% [78, 79] (Table 31-2) Pneumonia following RSV infection may be primarily viral, bacterial, fungal, or mixed in origin. Once RSV disease has progressed to respiratory failure, however, the mortality remains high despite the use of antiviral therapy, immunotherapy, or decreased immunosuppressive therapy. Fatality rates of RSV pneumonia range from 20% in more recent case series to over 80% in earlier studies.\n\n",

The most common risk factor described in multiple centers using different methods of case ascertainment and viral detection remains lymphopenia. In a prospective multicenter study carried out by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, lymphopenia but not neutropenia significantly increased the risk for lower respiratory tract disease [80]. Older age and donor status are also significant risk factors in some studies, whereas CMV serostatus, acute graft versus host disease, time relative to engraftment, and preemptive aerosolized ribavirin at a low dose of 2 h daily were not significant [81]. Investigators from MDACC have demonstrated that season of year, relapse of malignancy, presence of graft versus host disease, increasing age, and lack of engraftment are inpatient risk factors for the development of RSV pneumonia [9, 12, 22, 82]. Recently, large retrospective studies have identified graft source including cord or marrow (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 4.1, 95% CI 1.8\u20139.0) and oxygen requirement (adjusted HR 3.3, 98% CI, 15\u20136.7) to be independently associated with death due to respiratory failure in HSCT recipients [83]. Smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count < 100/mm3 at the time of URI onset are also significantly associated with disease progression [84].",

Asymptomatic shedding from upper respiratory tract has been reported, indicating that not all hMPV infections result in severe lower tract disease [50, 66, 85]. HSCT recipients with hMPV disease in the immediately posttransplant period typically present with respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, or fever. Once lower respiratory tract disease develops, rapidly progressive pulmonary infiltrates frequently accompanied by hypotension, septic shock, or both may be present [64] (Figure 31-2b and c). In a prospective viral surveillance in HSCT recipients where samples for respiratory viruses were obtained weekly, regardless of the presence of respiratory symptoms, a cumulative incidence estimate of hMPV of 6.2% (95% CI, 1.3\u201311.2) over 1 year was determined; all cases of hMPV had clinical respiratory symptoms identified ranging from mild to more severe disease with single or multiple symptoms [50] (Table 31-4). Among 15 HSCT recipients with hMPV detected by RT-PCR in BAL, 10 (67%) had positive hMPV RT-PCR in nasal wash sampled within 11 days prior to or following the BAL [49]. Viral RNA was detected in the serum of one of these severely immunocompromised HSCT recipients at two time points, 4 days apart, with a viral load of ~8 Log10 copies/ml in each sample. This patient died of severe respiratory disease. In assessing risk factors associated with overall mortality at day 100 posttransplant, the use of bone marrow as the stem cell source, steroid treatment and oxygen use have been associated with overall mortality [49].",

However, nosocomial transmission within the hospital setting becomes a serious concern because of the high rates of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients documented in nosocomial outbreaks. Hospital-based oubreaks of RSV infection in HSCT recipients can occur through introduction of circulating community strains as well as transmission of identical viral strains among patients [42, 44]. Outbreaks of RSV have been associated with high mortality rates ranging up to 45% of infected patients [89, 90]. The transmission of identical strains of RSV within the outpatient setting into the hospital setting has also been shown [91], demonstrating the importance of infection control measures in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. Nosocomial transmission of hMPV can also occur, with outbreaks possible in both inpatient and outpatient units. In one study, 15 patients were diagnosed with hMPV within 7 weeks in a tertiary care cancer unit [92]. Molecular subtyping revealed infection with genotype A2a virus, implicating nosocomial transmission. Four patients (26.6%) died from hMPV-associated pneumonia and consequent multi-organ failure.",

Aerosolized ribavirin, licensed in the USA for the therapy of RSV bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children in 1986, is the antiviral agent currently utilized for the treatment of RSV disease in immunocompromised patients. In general, ribavirin is given as an inhaled aerosolized solution via a face mask in a protective environment, such as a \u201cscavenging tent,\u201d to protect health care workers from potential drug contamination. Ribavirin was initially licensed for use when given for 12\u201318 h/day, but the use of intermittent aerosolized ribavirin given over 2 h, three times daily, was found to have similar effectiveness to 12\u201316 h/day continuous infusion ribavirin in healthy children [93\u201395] and has been utilized in adults because of ease of administration and enhanced tolerability. A randomized trial in HSCT patients at risk for LRTI evaluated intermittent dosing of ribavirin given over 2 h three times daily versus continuous ribavirin administration using an adaptive randomized trial design in 50 HSCT patients, with the authors concluding that the intermittent schedule was preferable because of ease of administration and evidence of higher efficacy [96].",

None of the ten patients randomized to high dose, short duration aerosolized ribavirin (administered as 2 g/100 ml water given over 2 h three times daily) had disease progression compared to 2/5 control patients, a trend that was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). Viral loads appeared to be reduced during the ribavirin treatment, but did rebound after cessation of therapy. Data demonstrating effectiveness of ribavirin is mainly retrospective. In an open trial in adult HSCT recipients with \u201cRSV-induced acute lung injury,\u201d monotherapy with aerosolized ribavirin was reported to be of benefit if initiated prior to the development of radiographic infiltrates [6]. In another open trial in adult HSCT recipients with radiographically proven RSV pneumonia, combination therapy with aerosolized ribavirin and high RSV-titered IVIG was reported to be of benefit only if initiated prior to the onset of respiratory failure [8, 98]. A retrospective MDACC study of confirmed RSV infections in 280 allogeneic HSCT recipients from 1996 to 2009 utilized multivariable logistic regression to demonstrate that lack of ribavirin aerosol therapy at the upper respiratory tract disease stage was an important risk factor associated with RSV LRTI and all-cause mortality [99]. In a retrospective study of HSCT recipients with confirmed lower respiratory tract RSV infection based on analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at the Hutch, viral RNA detection in the blood was detected in 30% of 92 patients at a median of 2 days following diagnosis of lower respiratory tract disease [37]. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical ventilation increased the risk of RSV RNA detection in the plasma or serum but lymphopenia and steroid use did not. The detection of RSV RNA in the serum or plasma increased the risk of overall mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of 2.09 (P = 0.02).",

At the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, combination therapy with aerosolized ribavirin (18 h/day) and RSV-IVIG (1.5 g/kg for one dose) was similarly associated with a favorable response in 2 HSCT recipients with clinically severe RSV pneumonia occurring early following transplant [105].

Other options include IV ribavirin (an investigational drug, ICN) and topical immunoglobulins administered with aerosolized or intravenous ribavirin [105, 110, 111]. The relative ease of administration of IV ribavirin is attractive, but high rates of mortality (80%) and significant cases of hemolytic anemia (20%) make this option currently problematic. Although the European experience with combination aerosolized/intravenous ribavirin has been favorable [112] and intravenous ribavirin is relatively simple to administer, the high rates of mortality and significant cases of hemolytic anemia make this approach controversial. Monotherapy with IV ribavirin may be more toxic in these patients than has been previously reported in patients with hemorrhagic fevers [113, 114].",

A retrospective analysis compared the outcome between 13 immunocompromised patients with hMPV pneumonia treated with ribavirin \u00b1 IVIG and ten untreated patients. Ribavirin treatment was associated with more hypoxemia and similar mortality, possibly related to late initiation of therapy [49]. A Seattle study describing hMPV lower respiratory tract disease in 55 immunocompromised children, including nine undergoing HSCT and eight SOT recipients, demonstrated that HSCT recipients had more evidence of severe disease [91]. Five of eight HSCT recipients but no SOT recipients had lower tract disease and were treated with aerosolized ribavirin; three had been diagnosed with hMPV pretransplant and during the posttransplant period received both ribavirin and IVIG. Two additional children received aerosolized ribavirin only. Ribavirin was generally administered at a dose of 2 g given three times daily for 5\u201311 days. Two of the three patients diagnosed with hMPV pretransplant who received ribavirin and IVIG died [91].",

The effectiveness of infection control interventions has also been demonstrated by the dramatic decline in the frequency of nosocomial CRV infections among HSCT recipients cared for in this transplant unit after the implementation of an aggressive, multifaceted infection control strategy [118]. Although this intensive multifaceted approach has been effective, modified versions of this strategy have also been effective. For instance, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) adult inpatient transplant unit uses a similar strategy with the exception that health care workers and other visitors do not wear masks when entering the patient room [91]. However, these workers are intensively screened for signs and symptoms of respiratory illnesses prior to entering the unit, and restricted from entering the unit if they are symptomatic. Similarly, HSCT recipients with respiratory symptoms are not transferred to other units, but are cared for on the transplant unit using modified droplet precautions with all persons entering the room wear gloves, gown, and mask, and the door to the room is kept closed. It may not be feasible to so intensively protect patients for the duration of increased susceptibility to respiratory viral diseases. Protective strategies are costly and cumbersome, and pose unpleasant restrictions on the freedom and quality of life of the patient and their families. This problem is further compounded by the growing trend to discharge patients early from the hospital and to perform outpatient HSCT or posttransplant care. Transplant recipients residing in the community and followed frequently in the outpatient setting are another group in which infection control practices must become priority [91].",

The cost of this therapy has led to new guidelines for use in the pediatric population [121]. Similar interventions have been utilized to attempt to decrease the morbidity of serious RSV disease in HSCT recipients but direct proof of effectiveness has not yet been demonstrated [115]. For example, passive immunoprophylaxis in immunocompromised patients has been evaluated in an open trial conducted [122] using high-titered human RSVIG. In this adult study, significant antibody titer increases to other respiratory viruses were extremely variable, although the subset of patients with the lowest titers appeared to receive the greatest increase in viral-specific antibody. The cost of this potential therapy remains quite high. The monoclonal RSV antibody palivizumab (Synagis) has been studied in an open label study in adult HSCT recipients [123]. Immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal RSV antibodies would be prohibitively expensive in older children and adults, but may have the potential to protect against RSV infection, based on pediatric studies.",

However, the assessment of viral shedding or infection in symptomatic transplant candidates prior to transplant is recommended. Delay of transplant based on detection of RSV or hMPV may be warranted depending on the evaluation of the risk and benefits of continuing on with transplantation. Consequences of postponing transplantation should be considered, including progression of underlying malignancy, logistical issues regarding the donor availability, and accessibility of services for the patient. An early study of RSV diagnosed prior to HSCT demonstrated that delaying transplant reduced the risk of pneumonia following transplant [23]. More recently, a large prospective study conducted in 458 patients at the Hutch demonstrated that nearly 25% of subjects had respiratory viruses detected pretransplant [24]. Overall, patients with a virus detected prior to transplant had fewer days alive and lower survival at day 100 (AHR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3\u20134.5) compared with patients who did not have viruses. In HSCT recipients who had respiratory symptoms and a virus detected prior to transplant (mainly adults), an increased overall mortality was seen compared with patients without respiratory viruses detected. Higher rates of pretransplant infection and sequelae of infection were seen in pediatric patients. Detection of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic patients was not associated with increased mortality. This data strengthens current guidelines that recommend patients with respiratory symptoms prior to transplant should be tested for respiratory viruses and transplant delayed, when feasible. However, this study was performed chiefly in adults. The higher rates of respiratory viruses documented in children pretransplant make routine screening of pediatric patients worthy of further investigation.",
