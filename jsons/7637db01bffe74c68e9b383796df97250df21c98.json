The 12 papers report that doctors are doing their best for the 13 patients, with minimal delays in the diagnosis and 14 treatment of urogenital neoplasms [1, 2] . This involves what 15 we can call social interaction, visibility, and social 16 distance. These three items, as discussed below, concern 17 clinicians, uropathologists, and patients. to be prioritized for treatment [2] . The question is whether we, as pathologists, will return 110 to the routine we followed before the pandemic. It is 111 difficult to foresee. However, considering that we are process of interaction [7] but also, above all, by working in a 128 tighter way than we have defined in the past: together we 129 can do it better [8] . And, as mentioned, the patient is always 1 -A pathologist uses a multiple-head microscope with a digital camera and a TV screen showing an image of prostate cancer.

In this context, social interaction refers to the fact 21 that the urologist deals with the patient from diagnosis to 22 treatment, and all the steps in between. They have an active 23 role and co-participate with the patient in the diagnostic 24 and therapeutic processes. The patient is not only informed 25 but is also always and constantly part of the discussion and 26 decisions. The urologist's role is not only the mechanical 27 process of removing the prostate in the surgical theater 28 while the patient is asleep. Should the urologist be simply 29 involved in a single step of the process, such as performing 30 the prostate biopsies at the request of the family doctor, 31 they lose what we can call visibility as a consequence of the 32 lack of social interaction. 33 The papers related to COVID-19 published in European 34 Urology help readers to understand how clinicians can 35 retain social interaction and visibility while maintaining 36 social distance in these difficult times when dealing with 37 patients whose treatment cannot be postponed [1,2].",

The background for this contribution was a paper 42 published in the same journal by Harrold et al.[4], who43 pointed out that the waning interest in pathology among 44 medical students led to a negative impact on the level of 45 visibility and social interaction of pathologists. Our paper, 46 the aim of which was to reverse this trend, was submitted 47 and accepted for publication months before any hint of the 48 current COVID-19 pandemic. When the article was pub-49 lished, our group suddenly felt that it might have appeared 50 at the wrong time. 51 Pathologists face the risk of being marginalized because 52 they do not have clinical experience or a role in the 53 diagnostic and therapeutic processes related to COVID-19. 54 At a time of global reductions in clinical activity, they risk 55 being confined to \"processing and reporting specimens that 56 did not really deserve to be examined histologically\", as 57 mentioned at the end of our paper [3]. This represents a real 58 threat to visibility and social interaction because of the 59 COVID-19 pandemic. 60 This consideration prompted our transnational group of 61 closely collaborating uropathologists to think about the 62 actual risk of not remaining visible for lack of social 63 interaction. We discussed how to continue to be an integral 64 part of the clinical processes still in place, and how the 65 current experience might influence our future approach to 66 pathology after the pandemic is resolved. 67 Equipment we all have readily available in our offices and 68 laboratories can have a particular value in maintaining, if 69 not increasing, the level of social interaction and visibility 70 while following the rules for social distance when closely 71 collaborating with clinicians in the diagnostic identification 72 of patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma, advanced 73 kidney cancer, testicular cancer, or penile cancer who need74",

There are basically two ways we can use routinely to 82 meet these goals.83The first is a microscope with a digital camera. The84 images are shown on a wide TV screen. A computer with a 85 webcam can be added for remote viewing using software 86 that is freely available on the internet. This set-up is 87 basically what we now use for intradepartmental consulta-88 tion (Fig. 1). 89 The second is based on virtual slides obtained with a 90 digital scanner. Modern equipment can also scan whole-91 mount sections (Fig. 2) [5]. Virtual slides are shared among 92 the group (members are located not only in Italy but also in 93 Portugal, Spain, and the USA) or sent over the internet to 94 other colleagues, with no limits as far as institution and 95 country are concerned. For instance, Google Drive can be 96 used to send a virtual slide via a link for downloading 97 images, as in the caption for Figure 2. The procedure is 98 simple and fast, considering that the size of a virtual whole-99 mount section can be in the range of gigabytes. The viewing 100 and image analysis software can be downloaded from the 101 internet free of charge. 102 This means that the histological features of both glass 103 slides and virtual slides are shared and their content 104 discussed with pathology colleagues for both consultation 105 and teaching purposes. The same systems are also used to 106 discuss cases with clinicians and even with patients. This 107 approach fulfils the basic requirement of social distance 108 while maintaining social interaction and visibility.",
