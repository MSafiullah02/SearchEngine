In the CNS, reparative processes after injury, such as inflammation and necrosis, are facilitated by astrogliosis.\nAxonopathy, distal of the CNS and PNS\u2014Degeneration of axons involving distal portions of peripheral nerves and distal portions of long axons in the CNS (spinal cord).\nAxonopathy, distal, of the PNS\u2014A neuropathy with degeneration of the terminal and preterminal axon of peripheral nerves.\nAxonotmesis\u2014Axonal injury of a peripheral nerve in which there is degeneration of the part distal to the site of trauma, leaving the supporting framework intact and allowing for improved potential for regeneration and effective reinnervation.\nBlood-brain barrier of the CNS\u2014A barrier to free movement of certain substances from cerebral capillaries into CNS tissue. Relies on tight junctions between capillary endothelial cells and selective transport systems in these cells. Endothelial cell basement membrane and foot processes of astrocytes abutting the basement membrane may play a role in barrier function.\nBlood-CSF barrier of the CNS\u2014A barrier that consists of tight junctions located between epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and the cells of the arachnoid membrane that respectively separate fenestrated blood vessels of the choroid plexus stroma and dura mater from the CSF.\nBlood-nerve barrier\u2014A barrier to free movement of certain substances from the blood to the endoneurium of peripheral nerves. Barrier properties are conferred by tight junctions between capillary endothelial cells of the endoneurium and between perineurial cells and selective transport systems in the endothelial cells.\nBrain edema\u2014Increase in tissue water within the brain that results in an increase in brain volume. The fluid may be present in the intracellular or extracellular compartments or both. The term also is used to include the accumulation of plasma, especially in association with severe injury to the vasculature.\nBrain swelling\u2014Marked, rapidly developing, sometimes unexplained increase in cerebral blood volume and brain volume because of relaxation (dilation) of the arterioles that occurs after brain injury.\nB\u00fcngner, cell bands of\u2014A column of proliferating Schwann cells that forms within the space previously occupied by an axon following Wallerian degeneration. The proliferating column of cells is surrounded by the persisting basement membrane of the original Schwann cells.\nCAE\u2014Caprine arthritis encephalitis.\nCCD\u2014Canine cognitive dysfunction.\nCentral chromatolysis\u2014Dissolution of cytoplasmic Nissl substance (arrays of rough endoplasmic reticulum and polysomes) in the central part of the neuronal cell body that results from injury to the neuron (often involving the axon). The cell body is swollen, and the nucleus frequently is displaced peripherally to the cell membrane. These structural changes functionally represent a response to injury that can be found (if the cell survives) by axonal regeneration with protein synthesis to produce components of the axon required for fast and slow axonal transport.\nCNS\u2014Central nervous system.\nCranium bifidum\u2014A dorsal midline cranial defect through which meninges alone or meninges and brain tissue may protrude into a sac (-cele), covered by skin.\nCSF\u2014Cerebrospinal fluid.\nDemyelination\u2014A disease process in which demyelination (destruction of the myelin sheath) is the primary lesion, although some degree of axonal injury may occur. Primary demyelination is caused by injury to myelin sheaths and/or myelinating cells and their cell processes. Secondary demyelination occurs with axonal injury, as in Wallerian degeneration.\nDysraphism\u2014Dysraphia, which literally means an abnormal seam, refers to a defective closure of the neural tube during development.

The cell bodies and processes of normal astrocytes are not visible with H&E staining.\nGitter cell\u2014Macrophage that accumulates in areas of necrosis of CNS tissue. The cytoplasm is typically distended, with abundant lipid-containing material derived from the lipid-rich nervous tissue. Gitter cell nuclei are often displaced peripherally to the cell membrane. These cells are often referred to as \u201cfoamy\u201d macrophages.\nH&E stain\u2014Hematoxylin and eosin stain.\nHydranencephaly\u2014A large, fluid-filled cavity in the area normally occupied by CNS tissue of the cerebral hemispheres resulting from abnormal development. The nervous tissue may be so reduced in thickness that the meninges form the outer part of a thin-walled sac. The lateral ventricles are variably enlarged because of their expansion into the area normally occupied by tissue.\nHydrocephalus\u2014Accumulation of excess CSF resulting from obstruction within the ventricular system (noncommunicating form) associated with enlargement of any or all of the following: lateral ventricles, third ventricle, mesencephalic aqueduct, and fourth ventricle. Hydrocephalus can also occur with communication of the CSF between the ventricular system and the subarachnoid space (communicating form). Hydrocephalus ex vacuo (compensatory hydrocephalus) is characterized by an expansion of the lateral ventricle (or ventricles) that follows loss of brain tissue.\nJoest-Degen bodies\u2014Intranuclear inclusion bodies (rarely intracytoplasmic) found in neurons in the brains of animals with Borna disease.\nLeuko-\u2014Combining form referring to white matter of the brain or spinal cord.\nLeukoencephalitis\u2014Inflammation of the white matter of the brain.\nMacroglia\u2014A collective term referring to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Has also been variously used to refer solely to astrocytes or to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells of the CNS, and M\u00fcller cells of the retina.\nMalacia\u2014Grossly detectable (macroscopic lesion) softening of CNS tissue, usually the result of necrosis.\nMeningo-\u2014Combining form referring to meninges.\nMeningomyelocele\u2014A form of spina bifida in which meninges and spinal cord herniate through a defect in the vertebral column into a sac (-cele) covered by skin.\nMicroglia\u2014Resident macrophages of the CNS that arise from mesodermal stem cells of the yolk sac.\nMotor neuron, lower\u2014Large multipolar neurons in the brainstem and ventral horns of the spinal cord with axons extending into the PNS.\nMotor neuron, upper\u2014Motor neurons with axons residing solely in the CNS that control lower motor neurons.\nMVV\u2014Maedi-visna virus.\nMyelitis\u2014Inflammation of the spinal cord.\nMyelo-\u2014Combining form referring to spinal cord.\nMyelopathy\u2014A degenerative disease process of the spinal cord.\nMyeloschisis\u2014Similar to spina bifida, except in its severe form is characterized by complete failure of the spinal neural tube to close, therefore a lack of development of the entire dorsal vertebral column.\nNageotte nodule\u2014An aggregate of proliferating satellite cells (see later) in a ganglion in which there has been degeneration of neuronal cell bodies.\nNeuroglial cells\u2014Astrocytes, oligodendroglia, ependymal cells, and microglia of the CNS.\nNeuronophagia\u2014Accumulation of microglial cells around a dead neuron.\nNeuropil\u2014The gray matter feltwork that consists of intermingled and interconnected processes of neurons (axons and dendrites) and their synaptic junctions, plus processes of oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and microglia.\nNeurapraxia\u2014Traumatic injury to a peripheral nerve with temporary conduction block but with no permanent axonal damage.\nNeurotmesis\u2014Complete transection of a nerve and supporting framework with little potential for normal reinnervation.\nOnion bulb\u2014Concentric arrays of Schwann cell cytoplasm around an axon signifying multiple episodes of demyelination and remyelination.\nPNS\u2014Peripheral nervous system.\nPolio\u2014Combining form referring to gray matter of the CNS.\nPolioencephalomalacia\u2014Softening (usually the result of necrosis) of the gray matter of the brain.\nPolioencephalomyelitis\u2014Inflammation of the gray matter of the brain and spinal cord.\nPoliomyelomalacia\u2014Softening (usually the result of necrosis) of the gray matter of the spinal cord.\nPorencephaly\u2014A cleft or cystic defect in the cerebral hemisphere that communicates with the subarachnoid space and also may communicate with the ventricular system. The defect may contain CSF.\nRadiculoneuritis (polyradiculoneuritis)\u2014Inflammation of a spinal nerve rootlet (or rootlets).\nRarefaction\u2014Reduction in density of CNS tissue that may result from edema, necrosis, and the like. This lesion is usually observed microscopically.\nSatellite cells\u2014Glial cells that cover the surface of nerve cell bodies in sensorimotor, autonomic, and enteric ganglia.\nSatellitosis\u2014An accumulation of oligodendroglia around neuronal cell bodies. Although this feature can be seen in normal brains, some consider that it may also be associated with neuronal injury.\nSclerosis\u2014Literally means induration or hardening and, when used in describing lesions of the CNS, often refers to induration or hardening of the brain or spinal cord resulting from astrogliosis (astrocytic scar formation).\nSpina bifida\u2014A dorsal midline defect involving one to several vertebrae of the spinal column caused by failure of the neural tube to close, permitting exposure of the underlying meninges and spinal cord. The lesion may be associated with herniation of meninges alone or meninges and spinal cord tissue into a sac (-cele) covered by skin, or there may be no herniation (spina bifida occulta).\nStatus spongiosus\u2014An encompassing term meaning the presence of small focal, ovoid to round \u201cclear (unstained or poorly stained [H&E stain])\u201d spaces in the CNS. The lesion can result from several different tissue alterations, which include splitting of the myelin sheath, accumulation of extracellular fluid, swelling of cellular (e.g., astrocytic and neuronal) processes, and axonal injury (Wallerian degeneration) when swollen axons are no longer detectable within distended spaces.\nSyringomyelia\u2014A tubular cavitation (syrinx) in the spinal cord that is not lined by ependyma and may extend over several segments.\nWallerian degeneration\u2014Degeneration of the distal component of an injured (compressed or severed) axon. Although the term originally referred to injury of axons in the PNS, current usage also includes the CNS. This process also results in functional and structural alterations in the cell body (central chromatolysis) and proximal internode segment of the axon, and in secondary demyelination.\n",

            "text": "The vertebrate embryo is formed by three layers of cells\u2014the ectoderm (outermost layer), the mesoderm (middle layer), and the endoderm (innermost layer). Nervous tissues are derived from the ectoderm and eventually form all central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissues of the adult animal. In the developing embryo, neurogenesis begins with a locally extensive, elongate proliferation of cells known as the neural plate, located along the cranial surface of the neuroectoderm (E-Fig. 14-1). The neural plate is bordered on either side by neural folds, which eventually fuse dorsally to form the neural tube (i.e., the eventual brain, spinal cord, and ventricular system). Immature neuroepithelial cells that line the neural tube ultimately become the source of neurons, astrocytes, ependymal cells, and oligodendrocytes. Resident microglial cells arise from mesodermal stem cells in the yolk sac that migrate to the neural tube during development, whereas the development and maturation of the brain and spinal cord proceed through a series of coordinated mechanisms characterized by cellular proliferation and subsequent remodeling (e.g., apoptosis) to produce the final morphologic features of the adult brain and spinal cord.",

            "text": "Neuroepithelial cells, which form the spinal cord, reorganize during neurogenesis to produce centrally located gray matter (shaped like a butterfly with paired dorsal and ventral horns) and peripherally enveloping white matter (also see later section on gray and white matter). The white matter tracts of the spinal cord are further subdivided into funiculi, which contain variable numbers of ascending axons (i.e., action potential travels in the direction of the brain) and descending axons (i.e., action potential travels in the direction of the cauda equina). Segmentation (i.e., formation of the general regions of the brain and spinal cord) and stratification (i.e., formation of the lamina of the cerebral cortex) of the neural tube during embryologic development require a great deal more remodeling. Initial expansion of the neural tube results in a developing brain that is segmented into sections called the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain) (E-Box 14-1; E-Fig. 14-2). With further development the brain divides into the five segments: telencephalon, diencephalon (both derived from the prosencephalon), mesencephalon, and the metencephalon and myelencephalon (both derived from the rhombencephalon) (see E-Box 14-1). The telencephalon in the adult animal becomes paired cerebral hemispheres. The diencephalon becomes the thalamus and its associated structures. The mesencephalon gives rise to the corpora quadrigemina (superior and inferior colliculi) and the cerebral peduncles. The pons and cerebellum arise from the metencephalon, and lastly the medulla oblongata arises from the myelencephalon (see E-Fig 14-1). Concurrently, the spinal cord is segmented into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral sections, which are further subdivided into individual spinal nerves.",

            "text": "Following the development and differentiation of the brain into the five segments listed earlier, there is differential growth (i.e., occurs at different extents, rates, and times) in each of these parts of the developing brain. For example, the brainstem (pons and medulla) undergoes marked reorganization to form numerous specific nuclei that are the source of not only the majority of the cranial nerves, but also a neural relay network for the majority of neural impulses that arise in the prosencephalon (e.g., cerebral hemispheres and thalamus). It is also during this period of embryologic differentiation that stratification occurs within the cerebral cortex resulting in the formation of cerebral lamina. Lamina are distinct topographic layers of neuron cell bodies that have similar functions and innervate specific areas of the body as designated by these similar functions. They serve as topographic maps for specific activities within the CNS such as sensory, motor, and associative functions. Additionally, these activities are spread out into distinct \u201cfunctional\u201d lamina within lobes within the cerebral cortex, such as the frontal lobe (cognitive functions), parietal lobe (motor and sensory functions), occipital lobe (vision), and the temporal lobe (auditory functions). Lastly, the cerebellum undergoes significant reorganization with the development of multiple integrated layers of neurons, including the granule cell layer, the molecular cell layer, and the Purkinje cell layer.",

In the CNS, gray matter is found in the cerebral cortex, in the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei, around the base of the cerebral hemispheres (basal nuclei [often called basal ganglia]: caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus [putamen, globus pallidus], amygdaloid nucleus, claustrum), and throughout the brainstem, often in nuclei. The gray matter is typified by numerous neuronal cell bodies, plus a feltwork of intermingled thinly myelinated axons and dendrites, their synaptic junctions, and processes of oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and microglia. This network of processes and synapses in the gray matter is referred to as the neuropil. The white matter consists of well-myelinated axons that arise from neuronal cell bodies in the gray matter and terminate distally in synapses or myoneural junctions, plus oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and microglia. In the cerebral hemispheres, white matter is located centrally, whereas in the brainstem, white matter is intermingled with gray matter (nuclei).

A population of neural crest cells that form bilaterally in the dorsal regions of the neural tube is the origin of the majority of cells that populate the PNS, such as neurons and Schwann cells. These neural crest cells also migrate peripherally in developing tissues and organ systems within the mesoderm and endoderm to form structures such as spinal ganglia, enteric plexuses, and the adrenal medullas. Neurons of the PNS are divided into afferent and efferent types based on whether they conduct impulses to or from the CNS, respectively. Cell bodies for somatic efferent neurons, such as those in cranial or spinal nerves, are located in nuclei of the brain or the ventral horns of the gray matter of the spinal cord and project ventrolaterally long distances to innervate peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle. The cell bodies for somatic afferent neurons are located bilaterally within spinal ganglia (dorsal root ganglia) that are developmentally associated with specific spinal cord segments. The neurogenic control of visceral tissues and organ systems such as the alimentary system is complex; involves at a minimum two neurons, a preganglionic neuron and a postganglionic neuron; and is facilitated by the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems (i.e., visceral nervous systems). As a basic rule, for all three visceral nervous systems the preganglionic neuron cell body is located in the intermediate gray matter between the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord or brain nucleus.",

Neurons vary in size, shape, and function, and their cell bodies are organized into functional groups such as nuclei, horns of gray matter in the spinal cord, and cerebral lamina. Neuronal processes called axons and dendrites traverse through the brain and spinal cord, the former often as organized bundles (tracts, fasciculi) forming synapses on cell bodies, dendrites, and axons of other functionally related neurons. It is estimated that there are 1 \u00d7 1011 neurons in the human brain. Each neuron makes approximately 10,000 synapses with other neurons; therefore there are approximately 1 \u00d7 1015 synapses in the human brain. The neurons maintain a close association with various glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The glia are responsible for helping to maintain CNS homeostasis and play an important role in the immune response and healing. Astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells are derived from neuroectoderm, whereas microglia, part of the monocyte-macrophage system, are derived from progenitors in the embryonic yolk sac that populate the CNS during development. In the mammalian CNS, glia outnumber neurons 10 to 1. Ependymal cells line the ventricular system, whereas choroid plexus epithelial cells form the outer covering of the choroid plexuses. Lastly, the exterior of the CNS is covered by the meninges. The meninges consist of three layers named, from outermost to innermost layers, the dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater.

Membrane potential is the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuronal/axonal cell membrane and is called the resting potential. This potential is established and maintained by a membrane sodium ion (Na+)/potassium ion (K+)-ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase) pump. The pump keeps the concentration of sodium ions outside the cell approximately 10 times greater than inside the cell, and the concentration of potassium ions inside the cell 20 times greater than outside the cell. The differences in concentrations of sodium ions outside and potassium ions inside of the cell membrane keep the membrane resting potential at approximately \u221270 mV. Thus the inside of the neuron/axon is 70 mV less than the outside. Sodium and potassium ions will leak across the cell membrane, and therefore concentration gradients are maintained by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump in the cell membrane.

When the axon lacks myelin, the flow of depolarization down the axon is called continuous conduction. When the axon is myelinated, the speed of conduction is determined by the degree of myelination of the axon and is called saltatory conduction. The diameter of unmyelinated axons can range from 0.2 to 1 mm with action potential velocities ranging from 0.2 to 2 m/sec, whereas the diameter of myelinated axons can range from 2 to 20 mm with action potential velocities ranging from 12 to 120 m/sec. The greater the degree of myelination, the faster the speed of impulse conduction down the axon. In unmyelinated axons, action potentials are conducted at a relatively \u201cslower\u201d velocity by the process of ion exchange (continuous conduction). In myelinated axons, action potentials are conducted at a relatively \u201cfaster\u201d velocity by a mechanism called saltatory conduction. In this process, action potentials move down the myelinated axon using cable properties, like electric current flow in insulated copper wires. This method is fast, efficient, and requires less energy than ion exchange. However, the action potential would decay if axons were myelinated continuously along their length and likely would not reach synapses at full strength or at all. This decay is caused by loss of current across the cell membrane and capacitance properties of the cell membrane as the action potential travels down the axon. To minimize the decay of action potentials, axons are myelinated in segments called internodes. A gap, called the node of Ranvier, is formed between consecutive internodes and measures between 0.2 and 2 mm in length. At this gap the action potential is restored to full strength by ion exchange. The node of Ranvier is highly enriched in sodium channels, and these channels are essential for impulse propagation via rapid action potential current restoration. Disease processes that disrupt myelination of axons will interfere with saltatory conduction, slow the action potential, and result in clinical dysfunction of the nervous system (see Fig. 14-21).",

Oligodendroglia have been compared with neurons with regard to their total cell size in that their processes occupy much more space than the cell body. Neurons have very long axons, which account for their size; oligodendroglia have extensive myelin sheaths, which account for their size. In H&E-stained sections, oligodendroglia are often confused with lymphocytes because of the similarity of the morphologic features of their nuclei and cytoplasmic volume. Interfascicular oligodendroglia and perineuronal satellite oligodendroglia are located primarily in white and gray matter of the CNS, respectively (Fig. 14-10\n); however, interfascicular oligodendroglia can also be found along axons that traverse through the gray matter. The mature, small oligodendrocyte has a spherical, hyperchromatic nucleus (see Figs. 14-7 and 14-10). As with astrocytes, the cell body and processes of this cell do not stain with conventional H&E staining methods and can only be demonstrated following special procedures that include metallic (silver) impregnation and immunohistochemical methods, including CNPase and Olig2.",

However, this term is imprecise as other glial cells can also contribute to sattelitosis. Similarly, alterations in the microenvironment of gray and white matter away from areas surrounding neuron cell bodies result in hypertrophy of oligodendroglia (see Fig. 14-10).

Microglia can become amoeboid by phagocytosing dead cells and cellular debris during remodeling and maturation of the CNS. Amoeboid cells then enter a quiescent stage and transform into ramified microglia. Ramified microglia constitute up to 20% of the glial cells and are present throughout the mature CNS, serving as sentinels of brain injury. Ramified microglia, also called resting cells, are most numerous in perineuronal and perivascular areas and in interfascicular locations in white matter. Evidence of pinocytosis in ramified cells suggests some role in maintaining the neural microenvironment. The principal function of microglia is phagocytosis, the initiation of and participation in the innate and adaptive immune responses, and in degenerative and inflammatory diseases of the CNS.",

The ependyma is a single-layered, cuboidal to columnar epithelium that lines the ventricles and mesencephalic aqueduct of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord (Fig. 14-12\n). This layer of cells is therefore situated between the CSF and nervous tissue. Ependymal cells have cilia that project into the CSF and beat in a coordinated manner in the direction of CSF flow. Other structures, referred to as circumventricular organs, which include the choroid plexuses, are covered by highly specialized ependymal cells. The surface of ependymal cells that form the choroid plexus have microvilli (microvillus border) and cilia that occur singly or more often in groups of three or more. The choroid plexus epithelial cells also have specialized tight junctions (zonulae occludens) that are a functional part of the blood-CSF barrier. In contrast to the choroid plexus, junctions between the conventional ependymal cells include gap junctions (transmembrane proteins form a pore, allowing communication between adjacent cells) and zonulae and fasciae adherentes, which permit movement of materials, such as proteins from the CSF, into the extracellular space of the brain. This cellular lining, however, is not a static membrane in that it regulates several processes that involve interaction between the CSF and brain. The functions include regulation of fluid homeostasis between the ventricular cavities and the brain, secretion and absorption of CSF, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and metabolism of substances such as iron resulting from the lysis of erythrocytes after hemorrhage into the ventricular system. Finally, ependymal cells have the structural and enzymatic characteristics necessary for scavenging and detoxifying a wide variety of substances in the CSF.",

Arachnoid villi are focal extensions of the arachnoid and subarachnoid space that extend into the dorsal sagittal venous sinus of the brain. CSF is secreted by the choroid plexuses in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. It should be noted, however, that fluid from other sources, such as secretion by the ependyma, interstitial fluid of the brain, and ultrafiltrate of the blood, has also been reported to contribute to the formation of CSF. It moves from the lateral ventricles into the third ventricle, from the third ventricle through the mesencephalic aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius in human beings), and then to the fourth ventricle. Once in the fourth ventricle, the CSF exits through the two lateral apertures of the fourth ventricle to enter the subarachnoid space. Lateral apertures are the two openings in the caudal medullary velum that forms the roof of the fourth ventricle into the subarachnoid space, one at each side of the cerebellopontine angle. Although the central canal of the spinal cord is connected to the ventricular system at the caudal end of the fourth ventricle, there apparently is little active movement of CSF within the central canal. CSF in the subarachnoid space is reabsorbed by the arachnoid villi in the meninges. Recent evidence indicates that other routes of CSF drainage, in addition to arachnoid granulations, also exist and vary in different species. Venous sinuses, lymphatic drainage, and the cribriform plate appear to play important roles in CSF drainage and the maintenance of normal interventricular CSF pressure. In fact, experimental evidence suggests that the cribriform plate route may be the most important of the four. In human beings the entire volume of CSF is circulated approximately four times a day; however, with aging, the entire volume of CSF circulates less than two times a day.",

            "text": "Before the responses of the CNS to injury are discussed, some fundamental concepts are reviewed in Box 14-2\n.Box 14-2Concepts in Understanding Responses of the Central Nervous System to InjuryThe cells of the CNS vary in their susceptibility to injury (neurons > oligodendroglia > astrocytes > microglia > blood vessels). Neurons are the most sensitive to injury, whereas glial and other cells are more resistant to injury.1.Neurons have only small energy stores; therefore they depend on an intact blood flow to supply oxygen and nutrients, particularly glucose. Neurons with the highest metabolic rate, such as some neurons in the cerebral cortex, will die 6 to 10 minutes after the cessation of blood flow after cardiac arrest.2.There is no regeneration of neurons. The neurons you have now are the ones you were born with; however, their metabolism is dynamic, and metabolites are continually turned over and replaced.3.If nerve fibers in the CNS are cut by transection of the cord, no or little regeneration of nerve fibers results. Therefore if sufficient motor nerve fibers are cut, there is paralysis; if not, there is a neurologic deficit.4.If fibers in the PNS are cut, they can regenerate under certain circumstances. This outcome depends on axoplasmic flow, alignment of the proximal and distal portions of the nerve, and the preservation and alignment of the proximal and distal portions of the endoneurial tube (the structure in which the axon lies).5.Healing in the CNS is different than in the rest of the body. There are few fibroblasts in the CNS, and they are principally found only in the leptomeninges and in the outer few millimeters of the CNS, where they are pulled into the cerebral cortex with blood vessels. Therefore wounds deep in the CNS heal by proliferation of astrocyte processes. Astrocytic processes fill small dead spaces of less than a few millimeters and encapsulate large dead spaces and abscesses. Superficial wounds or wounds that extend through the leptomeninges heal by synthesis and deposition of collagen by fibroblasts (fibrous connective tissue) and by proliferation of astrocytic processes. However, in contrast to the fibroblast, astrocytic processes produce a very poor capsule, which can break down easily.6.The cranial cavity is nearly filled by the brain, its coverings, and fluids. Therefore many lesions, such as tumors, abscesses, hemorrhages, and hydrocephalus in the brain, produce clinical signs because they are space-occupying lesions, which in neuropathology implies that they cause atrophy or displacement of portions of the brain or cord, depending on the duration of the injury.7.The blood-brain barrier can exert control over drugs and antibodies and prevent them from entering the intact brain. It is also a barrier to infection and is formed by the tight junctions of the endothelial cells, aided by basement membrane, and the end feet of the astrocytes, which lie on the outside of the capillary.8.Although the CNS has the ability to resist infection and injury, once the CNS is infected, it has a low degree of resistance when compared with other tissues of the body. Microbes, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, which normally would be relatively nonpathogenic in other organs, may produce death if the CNS is infected. This outcome in part is attributable to the complexity of the CNS and the fact that it is the most vital organ in the body. Any disease process will often cause catastrophic results in the CNS, as opposed to tissues such as the lung, liver, and kidney.\n\nCNS, Central nervous system; PNS, peripheral nervous system.",

Purkinje cells; some striatal neurons; neurons of the third, fifth, and sixth cerebral cortical lamina; and hippocampal pyramidal cells have the highest vulnerability. A regional vulnerability of neurons has also been reported (cerebral cortex and striatum > thalamus > brainstem > spinal cord). It is hypothesized that the most vulnerable neurons likely produce the most excitotoxins, such as glutamate, and are the most sensitive to them. Because of the microanatomic arrangement of the cerebral cortex, ischemic neurons often occur in a laminar pattern within the cerebrocortical gray matter. This microanatomic pattern accounts for the laminar lesions observed in thiamine deficiency\u2013induced polioencephalomalacia in ruminants and in other diseases such as salt poisoning in pigs and lead poisoning in ruminants.

Also during this time, neuronal depolarization potentiates the release of the neuroexcitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Persistent activation of glutamate receptors of target cells results in a disturbance referred to as excitotoxicity. This altered activity leads to a notable influx of extracellular calcium into cells, causing further impairment of mitochondrial function and the generation of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and nitric oxide. These reactive oxygen species, exerting their effects especially on lipid-rich cell membranes, can enhance the existing excitotoxicity, cause further influx of calcium into cells as a result of membrane damage, and ultimately result in neuronal dysfunction and death. Additionally, reperfusion of ischemic tissue after the initial ischemic injury can enhance the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites, thus amplifying the tissue damage. Other influencing factors include the temperature of the brain at the time of ischemia, with lower temperatures (as little as 2\u00b0 C decrease) having a sparing effect and elevated temperatures having an enhanced effect on neuronal injury following ischemia.",

These changes became what we now refer to as Wallerian degeneration. Although Waller described this process in peripheral nerves, the term Wallerian degeneration is also used to describe necrosis that occurs in nerve fibers in the CNS after axons are injured (compressed or severed). Focal damage to a nerve fiber results in decreased or halted axonal transport, which manifests most prominently as segmental swellings in the axon called spheroids (Fig. 14-18\n). Eventually the axon's myelin degenerates, forming areas of vacuolation into which macrophages infiltrate and digest the now necrotic axonal and myelin debris (forming digestion chambers). In the neuronal cell body of the damaged axon, lesions include swelling of the neuronal cell body, peripheral displacement of the nucleus, and dispersion of centrally located Nissl substance (central chromatolysis) (Fig. 14-19\n). It must be stressed that this is only one of several ways in which chromatolysis can develop. Chromatolytic neurons can also be found in a wide variety of neurologic diseases including viral infection and degenerative diseases like equine motor neuron disease. The development of Wallerian degeneration is directly related to the diameter of the axon, with a larger axon undergoing a faster rate of Wallerian degeneration.",

The increase of intermediate filaments and consequently the intensity of GFAP immunohistochemical staining in these cells are so dramatic that some have defined reactive astrocytes on the basis of this change. In protracted degenerative or reparative conditions, astrocytes termed gemistocytes can be observed (Fig. 14-20\n). These cells have eccentric nuclei and abundant pink homogeneous cytoplasm, in contrast to the lack of visible cytoplasm in normal astrocytes, with routine H&E staining. Animals with hepatic and, less commonly, renal encephalopathy can have a unique microscopic lesion in the brain affecting astrocytes of the cerebral cortices. In these types of encephalopathies, astrocytic nuclei tend to be in pairs, triplets, quartets, or more occasionally with prominent central nucleoli and are surrounded by a clear space, which is the edematous cytoplasm.

Resident microglia and blood-derived macrophages express major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens, serve as antigen-presenting cells, and possess a broad armament of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. Once activated, these cells can also produce nitric oxide, reactive oxygen intermediates, and other chemical mediators of inflammation that can damage the CNS if not under strict control. When tissue necrosis occurs, macrophages derived from blood monocytes phagocytose the lipid-laden debris of dead neurons, parenchyma, and glial remnants and accumulate in the damaged CNS.

The gross appearance of infarction may also differ according to location. Lesions affecting the gray matter tend to be hemorrhagic, whereas infarction of the white matter is often pale. This difference is probably due in part to the less-dense capillary meshwork in the white matter because vessels supplying the white matter have fewer anastomoses than those of the gray matter.

As can be seen, the tissue changes listed in Table 14-1 take different periods of time to develop in the living resuscitated animal after ischemia occurs. Variation in the times that specific lesions occur depends on the extent and duration of the initial ischemic event.

Acute brain swelling can be localized (usually of lesser significance) when associated with focal lesions or generalized (often serious) when caused by diffuse brain injury. Although rarely seen in domestic animals, one exception to the importance of focal lesions is extracerebral hemorrhage (acute subdural hematoma in human beings), which\u2014though principally involving the surface of one hemisphere\u2014can cause more mass effect (brain swelling) in the underlying cerebral hemisphere than the hematoma itself. In subdural hematomas, blood accumulates between the dura mater and the meninges. Hematomas also occur in the epidural region; however, the subdural variety are usually poorly circumscribed. If the hematoma is removed, the acute brain swelling can progress so rapidly that the brain protrudes (herniates) through the site of the craniotomy.",

It occurs following vascular injury often adjacent to inflammatory foci, hematomas, contusions, infarcts, cerebral hypertension, and neoplasms. The underlying mechanism of vasogenic cerebral edema is a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier that results in movement of plasma constituents, such as water, ions, and organic osmolytes, and proteins into the perivascular extracellular space, particularly that of the white matter (Fig. 14-27\n). In addition to extracellular accumulation of fluid, vasogenic edema can also be accompanied by some cellular swelling involving astrocytes. Vasogenic edema with the resulting accumulation of extracellular fluid can cause an increase in intracranial pressure within the CNS. This pressure can also be so severe as to cause neurologic dysfunction and caudal displacement of brain structures such as the parahippocampal gyri and cerebellar vermis (see Figs. 14-59 and 14-60).",

By means of the blood-brain barrier the CNS can selectively regulate its extracellular compartment and isolate itself from sudden biochemical changes that may occur in the systemic circulation. In the majority of the CNS, endothelial cells are nonfenestrated and are held together by intercellular tight junctions. These tight junctions actively prevent the movement of protein, hydrophilic molecules, and ions from capillary lumina into the intercellular compartment of the CNS. Endothelial cells also have a transmembrane lipophilic pathway for the diffusion of small lipid molecules and numerous highly selective polarized receptor-mediated transport systems for molecules such as insulin, transferrin, glucose, purines, and amino acids. Finally, endothelial cells express a net negative charge on their abluminal side and at the basement membrane, providing an additional selective mechanism that impedes movement of anionic molecules such as chloride ions across the barrier. Foot processes of astrocytes cover more than 90% percent of the abluminal surface of capillary endothelial cells.

In the brain there is prominent enlargement of the ventricular system proximal to the point of obstruction (Fig. 14-39\n). White matter adjacent to the dilated lateral ventricles is reduced in thickness, although the gray matter can retain a relatively normal appearance. As the hydrocephalus progresses, atrophy with fenestration and cavity formation of the interventricular septum (septum pellucidum), atrophy of the hippocampus in the floor of the lateral ventricles, and flattening of cortical gyri can occur. If the obstruction is abrupt and pressure builds rapidly, the cerebral hemispheres can be displaced caudally, causing herniation of the parahippocampal gyri under the tentorium cerebelli and of the vermis of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum. The resulting coning of the cerebellum can be accompanied by hemorrhage and necrosis of cells in the cerebellar folia as a result of ischemia and infarction. Microscopically the ependyma can become atrophied and focally discontinuous, and there is loss of cells and cell processes in adjacent white matter and variably in the gray matter.",

            "text": "Cerebral abscesses in animals are relatively uncommon but arise after entry of bacteria into the CNS. This may occur either from direct extension or hematogenously. With direct extension, abscesses occur following penetrating wounds, such as calvarial fractures, or from spread of infection from adjacent tissues, such as the meninges, paranasal sinuses, and internal ear, and through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid (see Fig. 14-29). Diseases that cause bacteremia or septicemia result in infectious microbes being trapped in vascular beds within the CNS and meninges. Abscesses usually arise within gray matter because it receives a disproportionate share of blood flow in the CNS, usually at the gray-white (cortex\u2013subcortical white matter) junction. They exert effects in the CNS by disruption and destruction of tissue and by displacement as space-occupying lesions. If the abscess grows quickly, tissue is more likely to be disrupted and destroyed and in the worst case penetrate the wall of the lateral ventricle and cause a ventriculitis. Bacteria in the CSF may be carried into the subarachnoid space and cause a leptomeningitis. On the other hand, if growth is slow, tissue is more likely to be displaced. Chronic abscesses become encapsulated by either fibrous tissue if they are close to the leptomeninges or by astrocytes away from the meninges. The mechanism of tissue injury is likely a secondary bystander effect related to the actions of the mediators of inflammation and the toxins and other products elaborated from bacteria. Bacteria appear to localize in specific areas of the CNS based on receptor-mediated attachment or because of vascular flow patterns unique to the gray matter\u2013white matter interface of the CNS that allow bacteria to attach to and move through the blood-brain barrier. This latter flow mechanism likely occurs because small blood vessels supplying the cerebrum fail to continue into the white matter and end with their horizontal branches running parallel to the surface of the gyrus within the gray matter at the interface with the white matter. Once within the CNS or meninges, bacteria replicate and elicit an inflammatory response. Lytic enzymes released from lysosomes of neutrophils and other inflammatory cytokines secreted by lymphocytes and macrophages destroy neurons and their processes and disrupt synapses, thus affecting neurotransmission.",

In animals, meningitis is most commonly caused by bacteria such as E. coli and Streptococcus spp. that traverse to the leptomeninges and subarachnoid space hematogenously. Bacteria can also spread to the meninges by direct extension and leukocytic trafficking. In common usage the term meningitis generally refers to inflammation of the leptomeninges (the pia mater, subarachnoid space, and adjacent arachnoid mater) in contrast to inflammation of the dura mater, which is referred to as pachymeningitis. Leptomeningitis can be acute, subacute, or chronic and, depending on the cause, suppurative, eosinophilic, nonsuppurative, or granulomatous. Inflammation of specific parts of the dura mater of the cranial cavity can occur in the external periosteal dura after osteomyelitis, formation of extradural abscesses and pituitary abscesses, and skull fracture and involve the inner dura in association with leptomeningitis. Abscesses of the pituitary fossa occur with some frequency in cattle, including in bulls with nose rings. Bacteria isolated from the cases include Pasteurella multocida and Trueperella pyogenes. The abscess can result from spread of infection arising in the caudal nasal cavity or sinuses, possibly through direct extension or through the venous circulation. Incision of the pituitary fossa releases a thick, viscous, opaque tan to yellow exudate, which can elevate the dura mater surrounding the fossa. Infection can extend via the infundibular recess of the third ventricle into the ventricular system, resulting in ventriculitis, ependymitis, and empyema. Systemic bacterial infections in neonates are a common cause of acute meningitis (leptomeningitis), which are suppurative and fibrinous. In animals, leptomeningitis secondary to a selective viral infection only of the leptomeninges is very rare and is usually seen in combination with viral-induced encephalitides.",

The epithelium of the choroid plexus and ependymal lining of the ventricles can be disrupted by cellular degeneration, disorganization, and necrosis, and this inflammation can extend into the adjacent CNS.

Rabies virus may first replicate locally at the site of inoculation. Infection of and replication in local skeletal muscle myocytes is an important initiating event. The virus then enters peripheral nerve terminals by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The probability is greater that the virus will be taken up by both axon terminals and myocytes after a large inoculation dose. If the virus directly enters peripheral nerve terminals, the incubation period will more likely be short, regardless of whether muscle cells are infected. With progressively lower doses of virus, however, there is a greater possibility that the virus will enter either nerve terminals or myocytes but not both. This situation can result in a short incubation period if the virus directly enters nerve terminals as described previously or could result in a more prolonged incubation period if there was initial infection and retention of virus in myocytes before its release and uptake by nerve terminals.",

Experimental data suggest that rabies virus phosphoprotein interacts with dynein LC8, a microtubule motor protein used in retrograde axonal transport. With sensory axons the first cell bodies to be encountered after inoculation of a rear leg would be those of spinal ganglia, whose neuronal processes extend to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. For motor axons the cell bodies of the lower motor neurons in ventral horn gray matter or neuronal cell bodies of the autonomic ganglia are the ones initially infected. It is not known whether viral infection and replication in neurons of dorsal root ganglia are essential for infection of the CNS. The virus then moves into the spinal cord and ascends to the brain using both anterograde and retrograde axoplasmic flow. During the spread of the virus between neurons within the CNS, there is also simultaneous centrifugal movement via anterograde axonal transport of the virus peripherally from the CNS to axons of cranial nerves. This process results in infection of various tissues, including the oral cavity and salivary glands, permitting transmission of the disease in saliva. An additionally important feature of rabies is that infection of nervous and nonnervous tissue, such as the salivary glands, occur at the same time, which permits affected animals to have the required aggressive behavior plus passage of the virus into the saliva to facilitate the transmission of the disease.",

After axoplasmic spread of the virus from an inoculated rear leg to neurons of the associated segments of the spinal cord, rapid spread of infection to the brain occurs via long ascending and descending fiber tracts, bypassing the gray matter of the rostral spinal cord. This early spread of the virus has been suggested to explain how induction of behavioral changes occurs before there is sufficiently severe injury to cause paralysis and allows dissemination of infection before there is time for a notable immune response. Spread of infection within neurons of the CNS occurs via both anterograde and retrograde axoplasmic flow, with corresponding neuron-to-neuron spread by axosomatic-axodendritic and somatoaxonal-dendroaxonal transfer of virus. Transsynaptic spread can occur by budding of developing virions from the neuronal cytoplasm (cell body or dendrite) into a synapsing axon or in the form of bare viral nucleocapsid (ribonucleoprotein-transcriptase complexes) in the absence of a complete virion.",

Mature rabies virions, which bud from the nearby endoplasmic reticulum, can also be located around the periphery of the matrix. With time the Negri body becomes larger and detectable by light microscopy. Classically in H&E-stained sections the Negri body, which is eosinophilic, has one or more small, light clear areas called inner bodies that form as a result of invagination of cytoplasmic components (that include virions) in the matrix of the inclusion. Inclusions that do not possess \u201cinner bodies\u201d have been referred to as Lyssa bodies, but they are actually Negri bodies without cytoplasmic indentation. It should also be noted that both fixed viruses (adapted to the CNS by passage) and street viruses (that produce the naturally occurring disease) produce the same ultrastructural features, but fixed viral strains generally cause severe neuronal degeneration that precludes the development and thus the detection of Negri bodies. Negri bodies also tend to occur more frequently in large neurons such as the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (most common in carnivores, like the dog), neurons of the medulla oblongata, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (most common in herbivores, like cattle).

There is active penetration of plasma membranes by microbe-secreted lytic products, allowing a portal of entry rather than by uptake via phagocytosis. T. gondii can then spread locally, free in lymph or intracellularly in lymphocytes, macrophages, or granulocytes to Peyer's patches and regional lymph nodes. Intracellularly, microbes multiply as tachyzoites within a parasitophorous vacuole by repeated cycles of endodyogeny during the early acute stages of infection.

Additionally, foci of necrosis and mineralization occur in the cerebrocortical white matter and are caused by fetal hypoxia and ischemia resulting from severe placentitis, fetal myocardial damage, or initiation of a systemic inflammatory reaction in the fetus. In older more mature individuals, T. gondii infections have been associated with immunosuppression such as occurs in concurrent CDV infection and toxoplasmosis.

Clusterin (dimeric acidic glycoprotein), a sulfated glycoprotein, initiates apoptosis when expressed in cells in elevated concentrations. It is proposed that clusterin secreted by astrocytes during status epilepticus is actively endocytosed by hippocampal neurons, and these neurons die by an apoptotic mechanism.

            "text": "Acute and chronic liver failure, as well as hepatic atrophy associated with congenital or acquired vascular shunts, often results in hepatic encephalopathy and disordered neurotransmission because of the accumulation of toxic substances, principally ammonia, in the systemic circulation and thus the CNS. Ammonia is formed in the gastrointestinal tract by bacterial degradation of amines, amino acids, purines, and urea from proteins consumed in the diet. In healthy animals, ammonia is detoxified in the liver by conversion to urea by the ornithine citrulline arginine urea cycle. Urea is far less toxic than ammonia and is excreted in the urine. Ammonia has several neurotoxic effects such as (1) changing the transit of amino acids, water, and electrolytes across the neuronal cell membranes and (2) inhibiting the generation of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in neurons. Ammonia and other toxic metabolites also (1) cause increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, leading to vasogenic edema, and (2) alter osmoregulation within the CNS. These mechanisms likely led to the spongy change (status spongiosus) characteristic of the disease microscopically. Because astrocytes play an important role in regulating fluid and electrolyte balances in the CNS and are the primary cell type having lesions (Alzheimer's type II astrocytes) in hepatic encephalopathy, it is not surprising that alterations in osmoregulation are a component of the pathogenesis of the disease. Astrocytes also contain high concentrations of glutamine synthetase, an enzyme that breaks ammonia into glutamine. Recent research indicates that glutamine, although a normal breakdown product, may actually have deleterious effects on astrocytes and may be one of the main contributors to astrocyte dysfunction noted in hyperammonemic states. Ammonia and other toxic metabolites likely also affect oligodendroglia. Finally, it has been proposed that alterations in the blood-brain barrier may facilitate passage of neurotoxins such as short-chain fatty acids, mercaptans, false (pseudo-) neurotransmitters (tyramine, octopamine, and \u03b2-phenylethanolamine), ammonia, and GABA into the CNS, leading to neuronal dysfunction. A similar condition, termed renal encephalopathy, has been described in dogs, ruminants, and horses. It is likely related to high concentrations of ammonia or ammonia-metabolites in the circulation because of inadequate renal clearance caused by severe glomerular or tubular injury.",

These areas include the deep cerebrocortical gray-white matter interface where the peripheral fibers that radiate from the corona radiata are found, basal nuclei and adjacent internal capsule, reticular areas throughout the brainstem, and deep cerebellar nuclei. The spongy change is due to intramyelinic edema, causing splitting and vacuolation of myelin sheaths. Spongy change can be produced experimentally by ammonia infusion and is reversible. Alzheimer's type II astrocytic change is a subtle alteration that has been reported in all domestic animals and is the only CNS change observed in horses with hepatic failure. Alzheimer's type II astrocytes are found in gray matter and have enlarged vesicular nuclei with peripheral chromatin, glycogen deposits, and demonstrable nucleoli or nucleolar-type bodies.

In acute organophosphate toxicosis, clinical effects vary but are manifested in the following:1.Parasympathetic nervous system, leading to salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, bradycardia, and pupillary constriction2.Skeletal muscular system, resulting in muscle fasciculations followed by weakness and muscle paralysis (i.e., death is due primarily to respiratory failure)3.CNS, leading to anxiety, restlessness, hyperactivity, anorexia, and generalized seizures (i.e., observed in dogs and cats but uncommon in cattle)\n",

Lead crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly using a cationic transporter, concentrates in the brain because of its ability to substitute for calcium ions in the pump, and enters astrocytes and neurons by voltage-sensitive cell membrane calcium channels. Lead disrupts calcium homeostasis, causing the accumulation of calcium in lead-exposed cells, and induces mitochondrial release of calcium, leading to apoptotic cell death. Astrocytes contain metallothionein and can sequester potentially toxic metals in the CNS, thus protecting more vulnerable neurons from the toxic effects of lead.

It is transported via retrograde axoplasmic flow within the axon and across synaptic junctions until it reaches the CNS (see Fig. 4-28). In the CNS the toxin is transferred across synapses until it becomes fixed to gangliosides in the presynaptic inhibitory motor neuron. Tetanospasmin blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as glycine and GABA. Inhibitory neurotransmitters act to dampen the actions of excitatory nerve impulses from upper motor neurons that are imposed on lower motor neurons. If these impulses cannot be dampened by normal inhibitory mechanisms, the generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus ensue. Tetanospasmin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles, thus preventing the release of neurotransmitters by the cells.

Recent discoveries have pinpointed the fungal endophyte Undifilum oxytropis as the ultimate source of swainsonine. The swainsonine compounds inhibit lysosomal \u03b1-mannosidase, thus inducing an acquired \u03b1-mannosidosis that mimics the inherited storage disease mannosidosis. Mannosidases are glycoside-hydrolyzing enzymes that are found in the Golgi, lysosomes, and cytoplasm of all mammalian cells. Analyses of tissue from animals poisoned with swainsonine have shown that swainsonine is present in all tissue; however, neurons; epithelial cells in organ systems, such as the liver; and macrophages of the monocyte-macrophage system of the spleen and lymph nodes are commonly affected. Therefore, as occurs in the inherited storage disease (mannosidosis), acquired swainsonine-induced storage diseases affect similar cells throughout the body. Additionally, swainsonine interferes with normal synthesis of glycoproteins containing asparagine-linked complex oligosaccharides. Swainsonine also inhibits Golgi mannosidase II, an effect not recognized in the inherited disorder.",

In addition, activated macrophages produce factors that also injure the endothelium. LDL cholesterol concentrations in foam cells and smooth muscle cells often exceed the antioxidant properties of normal endothelium. Oxidized LDL leads to additional metabolic changes that foster a procoagulant microenvironment and enhanced platelet-mediated thrombus formation, and initiates a cascade of events leading to the lesions associated with the development of mature atherosclerotic plaques (fibrous plaques with a cap [lipid-laden macrophages walled off by connective tissue]).

Fluid moves from the plasma into the brain. In this type of edema the blood-brain barrier remains intact.

Injury, physical or otherwise, to blood vessels within the CNS can cause the release of \u201csequestered antigens\u201d into the bloodstream, leading to an autoimmune response.3.Genetic factors: Functions of the immune system that are strictly regulated genetically may be under the control of abnormal inherited genes or altered normal genes that regulate immune responses to CNS antigens and thus increase the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.4.Stress factors: Environmental stresses mediated through the CNS can depress the functions of the immune system, leading to the formation of autoantibodies.\n",

Exposed antigens are then recognized by the immune system, and experimental studies suggest that lesions result from a complex interaction between inflammatory cells and their mediators and lamellae of myelinating cells. T lymphocytes, some B lymphocytes, and activated macrophages (recruited monocytes) and microglia cells, adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors have been demonstrated in the lesions.

Several neuropathologic principles have been generally accepted regarding craniocerebral contusive trauma in human beings, as follows:1.A blow to the stationary (but freely movable) head produces a cerebrocortical coup contusion beneath the point of cranial impact, but with rare exceptions causes no cerebrocortical contrecoup contusion opposite the point of cranial impact. This outcome is not always true of animals, in which a blow to the dorsum of the head from a flat object, such as a spade, causes marked subarachnoid hemorrhage on the ventral surface (contrecoup).2.An impact of a moving head (moving before impact, as in a fall from a standing position) against a firm or unyielding surface causes a cerebrocortical contrecoup contusion opposite the point of cranial collision (often at the poles and inferior surfaces of the frontal and temporal lobes), but with rare exceptions there is no contusion beneath the point of impact. In contrast, horses that fall backward and land on their backs and strike the occiput often have subarachnoid hemorrhage over the occipital poles of the cerebral hemispheres.3.Falls from great heights and crushing of the head between a strong external force and unyielding surface are generally not associated with the occurrence of contrecoup lesions.\n",

            "text": "Dawson and coworkers proposed a mechanism for both contrecoup and coup injury of the human brain that also addressed the specific deficiencies of mechanisms that have been advanced by others. An example explaining the mechanism of contrecoup injury states that when a person falls backward from a standing position because of loss of balance, the gravitational torque acting on the body causes downward acceleration of the head in excess of the acceleration as a result of gravity. Under these circumstances the brain lags toward the trailing anterior surface of the cranium before impact (causing displacement of the protective CSF layer between the brain and skull) and permits compressive stress to develop at this site, although impact occurs at the opposite side of the head. Because dissipation of the CSF at the anterior (contrecoup) site allows compressive stress to be focal at this contrecoup site and because of the shearing stress generated, injury occurs. In addition, a relative rotational gliding motion between the brain and skull is produced when the impact suddenly stops the skull's motion and rotation, thus creating an additive shearing stress because the fluid lubrication necessary to facilitate gliding of the brain over the cranial surface is reduced. The concentration of this rotational shearing stress is likely to occur beneath the frontal and temporal lobes because of the rough surface of the skull that exists in this location. In contrast to contrecoup injury, coup contusions occur infrequently in this type of fall. In such situations the brain lags away from the impact site, which results in a thickening of the protective CSF layer between the brain and skull immediately beneath the point of impact, which helps explain the absence of coup injury in primates and human beings in typical moving head trauma.",

            "text": "Coup injury in human beings can occur when a stationary but freely movable head is impacted. In this type of trauma there is neither brain lag nor disproportionate distribution of CSF before impact, which accounts for the typical absence of contrecoup contusions. With regard to falls from great heights, the dynamics involving rotation of the body about a fixed point of ground contact associated with a fall from a standing position do not occur. Because gravity produces no torque on a freely falling object, no angular acceleration of the body is produced; therefore such a fall is a true free-fall state that is associated with an absence of brain lag. For this reason, contrecoup lesions occur infrequently with this type of trauma. One point should be emphasized with regard to the evaluation of coup and contrecoup cortical contusions just described. Displacement of bone associated with skull fracture can contuse the subjacent brain, regardless of the resting or moving status of the head, and such fracture-contusions have nothing to do with the coup-contrecoup mechanisms described. Also, even though the basic mechanisms discussed earlier apply to human beings, they should also be considered when evaluating cerebral contusions of domestic animals, but the situation in human brains is made far more complex because of the numerous wide bony ridges that project into the cranial vault.",

Hematomyelia is also particularly associated with severe type I disk herniation. If larger vessels are torn, blood pressure can force blood into the gray matter. This outcome results in the formation of a dissecting blood-filled cavity ascending and/or descending initially within the gray matter of the spinal cord. This lesion, which is characterized by a softening to semiliquefaction (myelomalacia) and hemorrhage of the tissue, can develop within 12 to 24 hours after injury and can progress both cranially and caudally from the original site of trauma. As the cavity extends cranially, the hemorrhage at the original site also extends into the white matter and can transect the spinal cord. If this lesion extends to the fifth cervical cord segment, the phrenic nerves to the diaphragm will be denervated and respiratory paralysis will result. Bleeding continues until pressure in the blood-filled cavity is equal to the vascular pressure or until bleeding ceases because of hemostasis in the vessel.

At the site of injury, all parts of the white and gray matter of the spinal cord are affected and often necrotic, if the compressive force is sufficient. Rostral to this site, white matter degeneration is generally limited to the ascending tracts in the dorsal funiculi and the superficial portions of the dorsolateral part of the lateral funiculi. Caudal to the area of injury, degeneration is limited to the descending tracts in the ventral funiculi, and the more central portions of the lateral funiculi. It should also be noted that (1) a lesion may occur at the point of compression because of ischemia, but a lesion can also occur on the opposite side of the compression also because of ischemia that results from compression of the tissue against bone on that side, and (2) Wallerian degeneration can be observed in distal segments of affected axons far from the point of compression within the spinal cord. In the former case, compressive forces can be transferred through the spinal cord to axons and blood vessels away from the contact point, whereas in the latter example, degeneration of the distal axon segments can extend for a length of centimeters to meters away from the point of contact.",

The cells are often surrounded by a halo (so-called honeycomb effect), which is an artifactual retraction of the cytoplasm caused by delayed fixation. Other patterns of growth include cells arranged in rows, especially peripherally in the mass, or in semicircles. Mitoses are generally infrequent. Other changes include mucoid degeneration (accounting for the gelatinous appearance seen grossly), edema, cavitation, and rarely mineralization. Extensive necrosis is uncommon, except in higher-grade variants (i.e., more anaplastic morphologic changes) of the tumor, where serpiginous tracts of necrosis, nuclear atypia, glomeruloid-like vascular proliferation, and high mitotic rate are commonly encountered. Immunohistochemical identification of neoplastic oligodendrocytes can be aided by the use of CNPase and Olig1/Olig2; however, these markers are not 100% specific for the identification of neoplastic oligodendrocytes, and routine histologic examination remains the standard by which to diagnose these tumors.",

The meningothelial variant is composed of cellular sheets lacking distinct morphologic characteristics, whereas the fibrous variant is composed of interlacing bundles of spindle cells. The psammomatous variant is characterized by a predominance of mineral concretions (psammoma bodies).

Gross lesions of West Nile viral infection in horses usually involve the gray matter and include hyperemia and petechiation to prominent hemorrhage with prevalent involvement of the lower brainstem and ventral horns of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Gross lesions of hemorrhage are more likely to occur with West Nile virus than with the three equine encephalitides (eastern equine encephalomyelitis, western equine encephalomyelitis, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis). Microscopic lesions in birds and horses that have died of the disease are characterized by a polioencephalomyelitis and hemorrhage of the CNS that can vary in degree of severity. The inflammation is predominately mononuclear; however, neutrophils can be detected in some cases. Lesions outside of the nervous system in affected horses do not occur. Clinical signs of the equine West Nile viral infection include variable fever, depression, ataxia, weakness to paralysis of the hind limbs, tetraplegia, convulsions, coma, and death.",

The virus, which is endotheliotropic, even though infection of neurons and astrocytes can occur, localizes in small arteries and capillaries of the CNS and some other tissues after direct spread from the circulating infected cells. Inflammation of endothelial cells then results in vasculitis, leading to thrombosis and infarction of the neural tissue supplied by the thrombosed vessel. Latent infection of the trigeminal ganglion and lymphoid tissues can also occur.

The disease has a worldwide distribution, and the clinicopathologic features do not differ significantly from one part of the world to another. The primary target tissues are the vasculature, lymphoid organs, and epithelium (particularly of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts), but the kidneys, liver, eyes, joints, and CNS can also be affected. The virus appears to be transferred between lymphoid tissue/cells and endothelial cells via leukocytic trafficking in T lymphocytes. Two general types of the disease occur, the sheep-associated and wildebeest-derived forms, although several other less common causes of the disease have also been described. The causative agents involved belong to the herpesvirus subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. The disease occurring outside Africa, caused by ovine herpesvirus 2, often involves close contact of presumed \u201ccarrier\u201d sheep with susceptible ruminants. The disease has recently been reported in musk ox (Ovibos moschatus), Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana), and gemsbok (Oryx gazella). In Africa and occasionally in wildlife facilities outside the continent, the source of the infection (designated Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1) is the wildebeest. Two other antigenically related viruses, which apparently do not cause natural disease, include Alcelaphine herpesvirus 2 and Hippotraginae herpesvirus 1, which have been isolated from African hartebeest and roan antelope, respectively. It is generally accepted that cattle and other susceptible ruminants contract the disease in nature after respiratory or oral infection during association with carrier sheep (presumed) and wildebeest, particularly at the time of parturition.

Laminar cortical necrosis is characterized by neuronal necrosis (ischemic change), with a laminar pattern of edema in the cerebral cortex. Neurons in the middle to deep lamina of the parietal and occipital lobes of the cerebral cortex are preferentially affected (Fig. 14-95, A\n). In the early stages or in mild cases, lesions can be limited to the depths of cerebrocortical sulci, but generally there is involvement of entire gyri that may be confluent over extensive areas of the cortex. After 4 to 5 days, neuronal necrosis and edema are more severe, and there is an early influx of blood monocytes that mature into tissue macrophages and become gitter cells as they phagocytose necrotic debris. Macrophages and gitter cells are observed most commonly in perivascular and perineuronal spaces and in the pia arachnoid (see Fig. 14-23, A). After 8 to 10 days, necrosis and edema have resulted in laminar separation (at the gray matter\u2013white matter interface) in which there are prominent accumulations of macrophages (see Fig. 14-95, B). Lesions that accompany the necrosis include vascular prominence caused by endothelial cell and perithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, congestion, and a minimal, if any, influx of neutrophils. Bilaterally symmetric focal lesions, similar to those seen in carnivores, occur in the thalamus and midbrain or colliculi and rarely in other brainstem structures. Animals that survive can have cerebral atrophy and develop hydrocephalus ex vacuo and have been known to live 1 to 2 years. It should be noted that laminar cortical necrosis can be caused by a variety of metabolic abnormalities. In ruminants, in addition to thiamine deficiency, water deprivation\u2013sodium ion toxicosis, and lead poisoning can cause polioencephalomalacia and laminar cortical necrosis.",

Neurofilament accumulation in brainstem and spinal ventral horn neurons and fiber tract degeneration (corticospinal in human beings versus spinocerebellar in lambs and kids with copper deficiency) are similar. Drawing a relevant association between these diseases of human beings and abnormal function of superoxide dismutase in swayback and enzootic ataxia in animals is premature at this time, however. It is also possible that the cortical white matter degeneration and brainstem or spinal lesions arise from different mechanisms.",

Large multipolar neurons of the brainstem reticular formation, certain brainstem nuclei\u2014such as the red and vestibular nuclei\u2014and the ventral, lateral, and less commonly, dorsal horns of the spinal cord are affected. Neuronal cell bodies lack stainable Nissl substance (chromatolysis). The cytoplasm is variably dense, pink, and homogeneous to fibrillar as a result of the accumulation of neurofilaments, and nuclei are often displaced to an eccentric position against the cell membrane. The extent of neuronal necrosis varies. Lesions in the white matter of the spinal cord consist of bilateral areas of pallor in the dorsolateral aspects of the lateral funiculi (corresponding roughly to the spinocerebellar tracts) and also in the ventral funiculi adjacent to the ventral median fissure. The pallor of the white matter is due to degeneration of myelinated axons. Involvement of the medial (septomarginal) aspect of the dorsal funiculi is infrequent. In the terminal brainstem, lesions are similar but have a somewhat scattered distribution. The spinocerebellar tracts extending into the middle cerebellar peduncles are affected. Astrogliosis is usually mild. Definitive microscopic lesions in the cerebellum and ventral spinal nerve rootlets and peripheral nerves are usually lacking in lambs but can be frequent in kids. Changes in Purkinje cells are analogous to those already noted in neurons in other areas. Additionally, ectopic Purkinje cells and thinning of the granule cell layer occur. Bergmann glial cell processes in the molecular layer undergo hypertrophy. Lesions in ventral spinal nerve rootlets and peripheral nerve are caused by axonal degeneration secondary to injury of motor neurons in the ventral gray horns.",

After replication in the nasopharynx, virus invades sensory nerve endings and is then transported in axoplasm via the trigeminal ganglion and olfactory bulb to the brain. The virus has also been reported to be capable of spreading transsynaptically. Recent studies have additionally shown that some strains produce lesions in the gastrointestinal tract and myenteric plexuses, suggesting that infection might spread from the intestinal mucosa to the CNS via autonomic nerves. In latently infected pigs the oronasal epithelium can be recurrently infected by virus spreading from the nervous system, followed by its excretion in oronasal fluid. The virus can also spread hematogenously, although in low titer, to other tissues of the body. As an example, it can cause placenta disease in pregnant sows and is an important cause of fetal maceration and mummification in the pig.

Necrotizing meningoencephalitis is a disease that is almost always restricted to small breed dogs like the pug, shih tzu, and Maltese terrier. It was once referred to as pug-dog encephalitis before it was recognized in a wide variety of small breed dogs. Grossly, this disease appears as bilateral foci of malacia and discoloration of the cerebral hemispheres. Histologically, this gross lesion corresponds to regions of meningoencephalitis in which the inflammation is typically robust, nonsuppurative, and associated with marked gliosis. Unlike in cases of granulomatous meningoencephalitis, spinal cord involvement is uncommon. The second disease is known as necrotizing leukoencephalitis. This disease predominates in the white matter. It is most commonly seen in Yorkshire terriers, although sporadic reports exist in other small breed dogs. Gross lesions consist of prominent bilateral cavitation and necrosis of the cerebral white matter. Histologically, there is robust nonsuppurative inflammation accompanied by gliosis, cavitation, edema, and gitter cell infiltration. The etiopathogenesis of both diseases is unknown, and whether they represent a continuum of the same disease or distinct diseases is still debated. Populations of lymphocytes and macrophages as determined by experimental analysis are similar in the two variants.

Disk herniations in human beings commonly occur laterally, rather than dorsally as in dogs, contributing to the differences in clinical presentations (i.e., lateral herniations compress spinal nerve rootlets, whereas dorsal compression in dogs impinges on the spinal cord directly). In human beings the spinal cord terminates at the level of the second lumbar vertebra. Spinal nerve roots forming the cauda equina traverse the remaining lumbar and sacral vertebrae before they exit the spinal canal to innervate structures. In dogs the spinal cord terminates at the level of the sixth lumbar vertebra, and nerve roots forming the cauda equina traverse the remaining lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal vertebrae before they exit the spinal canal to innervate structures. Therefore in human beings, disk disease involving the caudal lumbar vertebrae (caudal to L2) results in compression of spinal nerve roots that innervate limbs and are reflected clinically in a condition known as sciatica that is defined as referred pain in the sciatic nerve. In dogs, herniated disks in the lumbar vertebra primarily compress the spinal cord and under certain circumstances spinal nerves. Dogs thus present clinically with different neurologic signs.",

Human beings, with bipedal locomotion and erect posture, dissipate the forces of walking (also running) by transferring these forces from the legs up the vertebral column to the lumbar vertebrae (i.e., first in line to absorb and dissipate forces). In addition, lumbar vertebrae are not stabilized by the rib cage, and thus lumbar vertebrae must also absorb rotational forces (i.e., twisting forces) of motion. Therefore lumbar vertebrae are the primary sites for disk herniation in human beings; however, because of the anatomy discussed earlier, herniated disks compress nerve roots and not the spinal cord. This arrangement results in pain but rarely leg paralysis.",

This anatomic arrangement results in the spinal canal being properly aligned in an axial plane, so the spinal cord can traverse through the space without compression. Extradural space surrounding the cervical, cranial thoracic, and caudal lumbar spinal cord is sufficient to allow for the accumulation of herniated disk material without substantial compression of the spinal cord. In contrast, there is little extradural space surrounding the thoracolumbar spinal cord; this is the site most likely to have clinically significant disk herniation.

It begins as early as 6 months of age, progresses rapidly, and results in the loss of elasticity of the nucleus pulposus. The loss of elasticity places additional mechanical stress forces on the annulus fibrosus, which itself is experiencing degenerative changes similar to those occurring in the nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus is thinnest and thus weakest at its point of contact with the spinal canal. If the annulus fibrosus is ruptured after stress forces placed on the disk by movement, such as jumping downward from a chair, fragments of the nucleus pulposus can be released into the spinal canal (Hansen type I herniation). If the annulus fibrosus ruptures dorsally, fragments compress the ventral funiculi of the spinal cord. If the annulus fibrosus ruptures dorsolaterally to laterally, fragments compress the ventral funiculi, lateral funiculi, and/or spinal nerve roots. Degeneration of intervertebral disks in nonchondrodystrophic breeds of dogs is an aging change of the nucleus pulposus resulting from fibrous metaplasia. This change causes a gradual loss of elasticity of the nucleus pulposus, which may be noticed clinically by 8 to 10 years of age. The gradual loss of elasticity places mechanical stress forces on the annulus fibrosus and results in its protrusion into and compression of the spinal canal (Hansen type II herniation).",

The viruses for each infection are antigenically and morphologically indistinguishable and are currently considered to represent avirulent (FECV) and virulent (FIPV) strains of the same basic feline coronavirus. After ingestion, FECV infects and replicates in epithelial cells of the intestine and usually is an insignificant infection, although severe intestinal disease can occur. Recent research suggests that a mutation in the gene for the furin cleavage site of a spike protein (a structural glycoprotein) in the FECV viral envelope gives the virus the ability to mutate to FIPV and replicate in monocytes/macrophages, use leukocyte trafficking (see Chapter 4) by these cells to spread systemically, and cause lesions characteristic of feline infectious peritonitis in other organ systems.",

The second mechanism involves a process referred to as antibody-dependent enhancement (demonstrated to occur experimentally), which involves uptake of virus-antibody-complement complexes by macrophages followed by significant viral replication.

In pointer dogs the onset is 2 to 12 months of age with signs of self-mutilation and insensitivity to pain resulting in neuro-pododermatitis or acral mutilation syndrome (Fig. 14-110\n).

In dachshunds a sensory neuropathy is manifested shortly after birth by ataxia and alterations in the function of the autonomic division of the PNS, such as urinary incontinence and digestive disturbances. Lesions in pointer dogs consist of small dorsal root ganglia with neuronal loss and replacement by satellite cells (Nageotte nodules) and mild reduction in size of dorsal nerve rootlets because of degeneration and loss of myelinated and nonmyelinated axons with the presence of cell bands of B\u00fcngner (indicative of attempts at remyelination).

Methylmercury is particularly toxic because it directly alters biochemical reactions. Although methylmercury poisoning can result from ingestion of water or forage contaminated with industrial discharge, in animals the consumption of fish containing excessive concentrations of methylmercury is the most likely source of the toxin. Fish accumulate methylmercury in their muscle as a result of a \u201cnormal\u201d environmental process called biomethylation. Biomethylation converts elemental mercury to methylmercury, which is ingested in the diet of fish. In mercury poisoning, sensory neuron cell bodies of the dorsal root ganglion are preferentially involved, and the motor neurons are spared, whereas with doxorubicin, both dorsal root ganglion and autonomic cell bodies are affected.

The disease has been recognized in central Europe for more than 250 years but likely exists worldwide. Borna disease virus has been classified as the prototype of a relatively new virus family, Bornaviridae. It most commonly infects horses and sheep, but cases have also been reported in dogs, cats, and cattle. Borna disease virus infection in horses was originally considered to result in a high mortality, up to 80% to 100% after 1 to 3 weeks of clinical illness. More recent evidence indicates that the majority of infected animals are either asymptomatic or have mild clinical disease that can be accompanied by behavioral changes, followed by recovery. The clinically severe disease in the horse is still largely confined to certain regions in Germany and Switzerland; the asymptomatic infection, which probably also occurs in other species, including human beings, is considered to have a worldwide distribution. Proposed peripheral spread of virus by axonal transport in the autonomic and enteric divisions of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has led to the suggestion that infection of these neurons might cause lesions responsible for colic and other gastroenteric dysfunctions in horses.",

The virus can also infect the retina by retrograde axonal transport via the optic nerve and cause blindness under experimental conditions. After reaching the CNS, the virus spreads intraaxonally and transsynaptically (proposed) as described for rabies virus. The virus can then also spread centrifugally via the PNS, resulting in infection of various nonneural tissues, including the lacrimal and salivary glands, endocrine tissues, such as the pituitary and adrenal glands, and other tissues.

The disease was first described in the United States, but cases have since occurred in other countries. Chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular microbes now classified as bacteria. C. psittaci is inhaled or ingested via an oronasal route and infects epithelial cells of oronasal mucous membranes and lungs, endothelial cells, and monocytes and lymphocytes. It appears to spread systemically to infect endothelial cells within the CNS via leukocytic trafficking in monocytes and lymphocytes. Lesions are nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis and serofibrinous polyserositis, arthritis, and tenosynovitis. Gross changes in the CNS, when present, are limited to active hyperemia and edema of the leptomeninges. Microscopic lesions extend throughout the neuraxis and consist of leptomeningeal and perivascular infiltrates of macrophages, plasma cells, and a few neutrophils. The basilar leptomeninges are most severely affected. Leukocytes extend into the adventitia of blood vessels accompanied by endothelial swelling and necrosis leading to vasculitis, thrombosis, and ischemia. Additional lesions include neuronal degeneration and parenchymal necrosis with microgliosis. Immune-mediated mechanisms have been suggested as the cause of the vasculitis. Calves younger than 6 to 12 months of age are most susceptible. Affected animals initially are ataxic but terminally may become recumbent and opisthotonos develops.",

The speed of the conduction process is determined by the diameter of the axon and the degree of myelination. As axons increase in diameter, the resistance to ion flow decreases, allowing the action potential to flow faster. In addition, the degree of myelination is directly proportional to the diameter of the axon. Thus the concept that the more myelin the faster the speed of the impulse is true up to the point in which the myelin is normal in thickness. For an axon whose myelin is reduced, conduction of the action potential is slower. Under normal conditions, locomotion is a well-coordinated event that requires precise timing (speed) of impulse conduction to get coordinated movements. If the speed of the action potential is altered by disease, especially demyelination, then the conduction of the action potential will be delayed, and what are normally coordinated movements become uncoordinated. A, In unmyelinated axons, action potentials are conducted at a relatively \u201cslower\u201d velocity by the process of ion exchange continuous conduction (see E-Fig. 14-4). B, In myelinated axons, action potentials are conducted at a relatively \u201cfaster\u201d velocity by a mechanism called saltatory conduction. Optimal function of saltatory conduction is dependent on having the proper degree of myelination of the axon (as determined by axonal diameter) throughout the full length of the axon. C, In axons that have lost some but not all of their myelin lamellae from one or more internodes so that there is a \u201cthinner\u201d covering of myelin, the speed of saltatory conduction is reduced because of leakage of the action potential across this thinner myelin sheath, resulting in clinical dysfunction of the nervous system. D, In axons that have lost all of their myelin from one or more internodes (complete primary demyelination of the internode), the speed of saltatory conduction is reduced because of the conversion from saltatory conduction to ion exchange continuous conduction in the areas where internodes have lost their myelin. Thus the speed and timing of the action potential is substantially reduced, leading to clinical dysfunction of the nervous system.",
