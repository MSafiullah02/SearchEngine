For all these reasons, on January 24, 2020 (Chinese New Year's eve), an online consultation was opened via the Internet.",

The first batch of experts in the country accepted patient consultations, and the number of consultations in New Year's eve exceeded 10 000. Note that 346 doctors have joined so far, and a total of 59 260 patient consultations have been received online. The online system divides people into asymptomatic anxious people (option 1 in figure 1) and symptomatic patients (option 2 in figure 1). This guides patients to seek medical treatment and psychotherapy in a rational and orderly manner, and has effectively alleviated the pressure on offline consultation for fever clinics.",

This progress was made possible because the general specialty clinics of many hospitals ceased to operate, and then almost all medical staff and resources devoted to epidemic prevention. However, the suspension of general specialist clinics has made it difficult for patients with chronic diseases other than SARS-CoV-2 infection to go to the hospital. Meanwhile, these patients are afraid to enter the clinic because they have no confidence in their resistance and immunity, and are afraid of cross-infection, and the delay in treatment of these patients will also cause incalculable consequences.",

Thankfully, through online consultation, the patient was able to know how to adjustment his medication. However, there are limitations to the detail that can be communicated by online consultation; patients urgently need to talk face-to-face with doctors. Based on the demands of these chronic patients, Tongji Hospital upgraded the \u201conline consultation\u201d service function on February 14, and opened the \u201ccloud clinic\u201d: online video consultation and drug distribution (figure 1). Patients can choose different specialties according to their own conditions and have face-to-face communication with doctors (option 3 in figure 1). Fever clinics have also been upgraded to an online video mode. The cloud clinic has now covered all major departments in the hospital (including medical; surgical; obstetrics and gynaecology; paediatrics; ophthalmology; ear, nose and throat; and psychology) to fully meet the needs of patients.",
