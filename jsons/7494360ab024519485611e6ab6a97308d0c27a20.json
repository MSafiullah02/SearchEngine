In order to prevent the influence of cache, cookies, and watch history on the search process, a new YouTube account was created for this study. In all searches, the relevancy level in filter was selected as default on YouTube. The first 50 results were recorded in separate list based on each keyword. The reason why the first 50 results were selected is that some studies show that YouTube users do not tend to watch videos after a couple of pages [24] . These videos are reviewed and examined in accordance with the stages in Figure- 1. Since the literature demonstrates that the optimal length for a YouTube video is between 10 and 16 minutes, those who exceeded the 15 minutethreshold were eliminated during the study [25] . Ultimately, 101 Turkish and 67 English videos, which met these criteria, were included to the study.

The reason for the differences in the scores of DISCERN and MICI between our study and Khatri et al.'s study can be that there might be a change in the ranks of English videos from their study time to ours. On the other hand, there might be a bias of researchers in terms of their evaluations and rankings. Nevertheless, it is still significant to see that only six videos had a score of 10 or above in a ranking system that examines the information quality of contents in which the maximum score is 25. Furthermore, four of those videos were released through news channels and none of them was produced by an academic institution or the Ministry of Health. During the COVID-19 period, one research studied the most popular 100 videos in English to examine the information quality of preventive behaviors and indicated only one-third of those videos included one of the seven different preventive behaviors.

Since this study was conducted in a specific time period, it can lead to different results if it is conducted in different periods because the content and definitive features of YouTube are subject to change instantly. However, since this study was conducted more than three months after the announcement of the first confirmed case, the videos which were analyzed might relatively have a standard ranking. Although kappa coefficient was used for the measurement of DISCERN and MICI scores, there might be some issues regarding both intra-and inter-observer bias in our study. Lastly, it might be also a limitation that we only included videos in two different languages with five different keywords which led us to evaluate 50 videos for each keyword.",

However, since there is not a peer-review system on YouTube, except copyright and common complaint issues, people can almost release every type of videos. Consequently, it also becomes a suitable platform for the spread of misinformation and disinformation. News channels are the most-used sources of videos for users. It is very important for the content of videos that are released through these news channels to be accurate because the important messages can be spread among people in society through them. However, the fact that the videos created by international institutions, academic and ministry accounts tend to be watched less than news channels shows that these institutions are not successful in using such platforms. Different solutions should be developed in order to increase the view counts of these institutions. During the extraordinary situations such as the pandemics, the videos of official health authorities and international institutions should be more visible in YouTube. In Turkey, the YouTube videos regarding the COVID-19 are provided through COVID-19 health portals and these portals are linked to the information address of the Ministry of Health (covid19.saglik.gov.tr) [30] .",
