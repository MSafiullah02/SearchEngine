They study the transfer of the TME between the different compartments in and downstream of the reservoir. In particular, they show that upstream areas contributed to bring TME in the Mae Thang Reservoir and that TME concentrations in fishes were thus affected and should be controlled. Finally, they conclude that accumulation of TME in soils of paddy field due to the use of pesticides and fertilizer may increase contamination of rice in the long term.",

They observed that in both rubber plantations and forests, Aedes albopictus was the most frequent mosquito. The use of geometric morphometrics tools allowed to distinguish the populations, potentially invasive, in rubber plantations from the ones, potentially native, in fragmented forests. Rubber plantations (RP) in Asia represent millions of artificial breeding sites for dangerous mosquitoes: they could be responsible for the drastic increase and recent planetary importance of Aedes albopictus populations.",
