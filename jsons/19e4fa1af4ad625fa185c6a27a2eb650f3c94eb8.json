National 49 guidelines currently recommend 12-14 in-person prenatal visits, a schedule unchanged since 50 1930. In scrutinizing the standard prenatal visit schedule, it quickly becomes clear that prenatal 51 care is overdue for a redesign. We have strong evidence of the benefit of many prenatal 52 services, like screening for gestational diabetes and maternal vaccination. Yet how to deliver 53 these services is much less clear. Studies of prenatal services consistently demonstrate such 54 care can be delivered in fewer than 14 visits, and that we do not need to provide all maternity 55 services in person. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising care delivery option for patients 56 seeking greater flexibility, and early trials leveraging virtual care and remote monitoring have 57 shown positive maternal and fetal outcomes with high patient satisfaction.",

Our initial work 59 assessed the literature, elicited patient perspectives, and captured the insights of experts in 60 patient-centered care delivery. Two key principles emerged to inform prenatal care redesign: 1) 61 design care delivery around essential services, using in-person care for services that cannot 62 be delivered remotely and offering video visits for other essential services; and 2) create 63 flexible services for anticipatory guidance and psychosocial support that allow patients to 64 tailor support to meet their needs through opt-in programs. The rise of COVID-19 prompted us 65 to extend this early work and rapidly implement a redesigned prenatal care pathway. In this 66 paper, we outline our experience rapidly transitioning prenatal care to a new model with 4 in-67 person visits, 1 ultrasound visit, and 4 virtual visits (the 4-1-4 prenatal plan). We then explore 68 how lessons from this implementation can inform patient-centered prenatal care redesign during 69 and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. ",

Still, some populations may be 199 disadvantaged by telemedicine: for example, patients in rural settings or of low-socioeconomic 200 status, who do not have stable internet connections. Some of these technologic barriers have 201 been removed during the pandemic through free internet options, and building greater 202 connectivity in the future will be crucial for ensuring no patients fall through the safety net.",

Telemedicine has emerged as a promising care delivery option for patients seeking greater flexibility, and early trials leveraging virtual care and remote monitoring have shown positive maternal and fetal outcomes with high patient satisfaction. 5 A recent survey of our own obstetric population found 90 over 85% of patients desired telemedicine contact with their healthcare team between visits. 6Recognizing that prenatal care delivery is overdue to be redesigned, we have been working for 93 the past year on a new prenatal care pathway. The rise of COVID-19 has prompted us to extend this work and respond to the exigent need for social distancing and resource conservation by rapidly redesigning prenatal care delivery around essential services identified by ACOG actionable insights for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in the short term, and for designing patient-centered prenatal care long after the pandemic resolves.",
