Viruses affect the CNS in many different ways and clinical manifestations may overlap, resulting in a spectrum of syndromes. Sejvar (2014) eloquently summarizes the different alternatives of the viral-mediated disease in the CNS responsible for these syndromes [1] . In the more acute phase patients may present with meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis or combinations if multiple regions are affected e.g. meningoencpehalitis or encephalomyelitis [1] [2] [3] . If vasculitis is a prominent component in a specific disease process, patients may present with more focal signs due to areas of infarcts [1] . In the long term, reactivation of a dormant infection with episodic recurrence will be observed, or a relentless chronic neurodegenerative process may occur and cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) or \"slow viruses\" [1] . Congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or rubella, may result in neurodevelopmental disorders with a more chronic nature [1] . The CNS may also be affected secondarily by a viral-induced immune-mediated attack on the CNS, or indirectly, as seen in liver failure-associated encephalopathy due to viral hepatitis or Reye's syndrome, which is precipitated by salicylate treatment in children with influenza or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection [1] . However, to confirm a specific diagnosis is challenging, because the clinical presentation as well as the special investigations are often non-specific. The aim of this chapter is to outline the facts which are known and the many conundrums still faced, and to aid clinicians in making informed decisions on the management of their patients.

The food industry has become mass-production orientated, and this favors more food-borne outbreaks. The natural evolution of viruses may increase the virulence of the organisms. Natural disasters and war responsible for the breakdown of infrastructure, as well as deliberate biological warfare, all contribute to the emergence, re-emergence and spread of viruses [1] . It is difficult to compare incidences and prevalences, because the case definitions used in different studies vary, and most studies reflect the endemic disease in industrialized countries [1] . Another contributing factor complicating agreement on incidence and prevalence is that encephalitis is, in most countries, not a notifiable disease [20] . Britton et al. (2016) mention incidence ranges of between 2.8 and 10.5 per 100,000 that have been reported in England, Sweden and the USA [21] . The highest rates have been documented in infants less than 1 year of age. Hospital admissions of children due to encephalitis decreased over a period of 11 years in Australia, but the average hospitalization rate was 5/100,000 [21] . There has been a significant decrease in varicella encephalitis, explained by good varicella vaccine coverage [21] . By contrast, an increase in ADEM-related encephalitis has been documented, and ADEM-related encephalitis now accounts for 15-17% of encephalitis-related admissions [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 480, "end": 483, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1190, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1385, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1540, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1564, "text": "Britton et al.

Swanson and McGavern outline the current understanding of this process clearly [2] . First of all the virus has to enter the host. This can happen through inhalation or ingestion, or through the skin. Viruses such as mumps and + uncommon, ++ occasional, +++ most common measles are spread via droplets, and are inhaled to reach the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. The fecal-oral route of ingestion is a way for other viruses, such as enteroviruses, to enter through the alimentary tract. Once at the mucosal membrane, the viruses pass the epithelial barrier and cause infection in the lymphoid tissue of the oropharynx and gut. Insect bites, abrasions and wounds all create a back door through which viruses can enter the body via the skin. Langerhans cells carry arboviruses delivered by insect bites to the adjacent lymph nodes [2] . The second step, for viruses on their way to reach the CNS, is to spread via one of two main routes, blood or peripheral nerves [2, 6] . Viruses either just float to the brain in the bloodstream, or are transported in white blood cells. The \"Trojan horses\" for Epstein Barr virus are monocytes. HSV-1 and VZV migrate from the keratinocytes to the peripheral sensory neurons to reach the trigeminal ganglion, where they can be latent for years before being reactivated [2] . The dendrites of the olfactory nerve are in direct contact with mucosa in the nose and offer a unique port of entry for HSV-1, Nipah virus, influenza virus and rabies virus [2] . In the case of a dog bite, rabies virus first infects the myocytes, and migration via the peripheral somatic nerves follows [2] .

These vaccines are called transmission blocking vaccines [58] . One example is dengue virus vaccine. The proteins required in the mosquito for the attachment of the virion to target cells in its midgut, are used in the vaccine as antigens. When a mosquito feeds on a vaccinated human, the antibodies are ingested and subsequently impair the virion attachment in the mosquito, interrupting the completion of its life cycle.
