Therefore there is an urgent need for proactive preparation, and planning to combat COVID-19, as well as to safeguard patients, their families, and healthcare personnel. This review article is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) current recommendations for COVID-19 and its adaptation to our local resources. The aim of this article is to provide basic consolidated guidance and checklists to clinicians in the neonatal intensive care units in key aspects of preparation needed to counter exposure or infection with COVID-19. We anticipate that CDC will continue to update their guidelines regarding COVID-19 as the situation evolves, and we recommend monitoring CDC's updates for the most current information.",

This study presented limited information regarding a detailed timing of separation of the newborns from the mother and other family members with COVID-19 who may have been in close contact with the newborns after delivery. There was also insufficient information on the method of feeding for the neonates, all of which makes it difficult to determine if the infection among these newborns was vertically or horizontally transmitted. In a case series by Zhu et al. outcomes of 10 neonates, including two pairs of twins, born to mothers with COVID-19 were reported 13 . One neonate died, six were born premature (31 to 34 weeks gestational age), and two were small for their gestational age. None of the newborns that got tested (with nasopharyngeal swabs) for SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed positive.

Using a negative real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test from throat swabs and blood samples they observed virus specific antibodies detected in the serum of all six newborns despite no physical contact with the mother after delivery 14 . Two infants had IgG and IgM levels higher than the normal level (<10 AU/mL) and inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly increased in all infants. None of the infants presented with any symptoms as of March 8, 2020 . In their editorial comment regarding this case series as well another case report published on the same day 14,15 , Kimberlin et al. expressed caution in interpreting the results from these reports 16 . IgM antibodies have a large polymeric structure and thus do not cross the placenta. When IgM antibodies are found in a newborn, they may reflect fetal production following in-utero infection. IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for congenital infections has a lower sensitivity / specificity than molecular diagnostic tests based on nucleic acid amplification and detection, and may have higher false-positive or false-negative results. One of the case reports described a very rapid decline in the level of IgM antibodies in these newborns 15 , which is very unusual for IgM levels in other congenitally acquired infections in which they typically last for a few months. Given this information, it remains unclear if these reports represented a true congenital infection, or just an artifact of resulting antibody levels.",

In particular, many N95 masks are made in, or their raw material for production is obtained primarily from, Hubei province in China, which was the first epicenter for this outbreak. Therefore, there was a backlog of PPE reported by multiple institutions. Critical supplies, including identifying alternative products for PPE, should be continuously assessed. There should be an institution-based plan to conserve and develop re-use protocols for critical supplies including N95 respirators and surgical masks, in order to prepare for extended supply chain disruptions. Transparency to the staff and actions to allow for the HCP team to feel confident and safe while caring for patients is of the utmost importance.",

There needs to be a local institutional plan in place for such situations, so patients can be cared for safely and transferred out, if needed, with prior preparation for safe transports. Due to significant usage of oxygen while caring for patients with COVID-19 throughout the hospital, a back up system to ensure continuous oxygen supply should be devised. Our institution has established staffing and employee wellness task forces to identify external clinical resources and support our staff who may be asked to care for COVID-19 patients. There are daily multidisciplinary leadership and management calls to set an operational tempo, assess preparedness, and prioritize enterprise-wide action. We developed a plan for our NICU regarding census and staffing, involving clear directions for patient care and when to initiate transferring patients out if needed. There should also be a plan for cohorting of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the NICU and well-baby nursery if space becomes an issue. Medical service providers will also be under tremendous psychological pressure due to overwork, shortage of medical resources, patients' poor outcomes, infection among their colleagues, or other detrimental experiences. Medical staff should be provided with adequate psychological support, as their physical and mental health is crucial in the context of a pandemic.",

Children seem to be less affected with this infection based on the limited published literature, however, one of the most vulnerable pediatric patient populations is cared for in NICUs. Current data on the effects of COVID-19 in fetal life and among neonates after birth is uncertain. As such, there is a need for proactive preparation and planning to manage these viral infections in neonates in ways that safeguard the patients, their families, and the healthcare personnel providing their care. Our understanding of COVID-19 is still evolving; therefore, we strongly suggest continuously monitoring the latest updates from CDC and local health authorities. Every health care facility should evaluate their available resources and make locally suited guidelines to take care of newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, consistent with recommendations from CDC.

Currently this viral infection has spread to more than 180 countries, with confirmed positive cases greater than 3 million people and associated deaths exceeding 210,000 individuals. The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States on January 20, 2020 1 . Subsequently about 950,000 patients have been confirmed to be infected and greater than 56,000 patients have died, with an ongoing and seriously concerning rapid increase in the number of patients, and deaths associated with COVID-19. Many countries, including the United States, have now reported community spread of COVID-19. The coronavirus family is a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses that commonly cause infections in humans and other mammals such as bats, cats, cattle, and camels. The SARS-CoV2 virus that causes COVID-19 is a \u03b2-Coronavirus with more than half of the sequence similar to previously known Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that caused epidemics in the last two decades. We have a limited understanding of COVID-19 infections.",

[Figure: COVID-19 Neonatal Workflow] Preparation before delivery Preparation starts with identifying one of two possible scenarios: a mother with confirmed infection with COVID-19, or a mother with a suspected infection or a PUI. The obstetrics team should have guidelines in place for both triage and delivery of the fetus. Infectious Disease (ID) and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) teams should be consulted for any suspected or confirmed cases. This should be clearly documented in the medical record and communicated to other teams taking care of these mothers in conjunction with the primary obstetrics team, including neonatology. Obstetric teams should have a low threshold for testing of COVID-19 infections in mothers with a new onset of symptoms, including fever, which otherwise would have been worked up for chorioamnionitis, as well as for any other upper respiratory symptom. At some institutions with widespread community transmission, all mothers admitted to the labor and delivery ward are tested for SARS-CoV-2, which may be helpful in identifying asymptomatic patients. This may not be possible at all institutes, as it requires resources for a lot of testing with rapid turnaround times. Deliveries at-risk for super spreading events or with uncertain progressive clinical courses should be done in a negative pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with airborne/ contact/ eye-shield precautions (N95 or higher respirator with eye shield or powered air-purifying respirator/ gown/ gloves). Mothers with suspected or confirmed infection, with a stable course and unlikely to require super spreading events, could alternatively stay in a neutral pressure room with droplet/ contact/ eye-shield precautions (surgical mask [N95 or higher respiratory preferred]/ eye shield/ gown/ gloves). Team members who would attend high-risk deliveries should be identified at the beginning of the shift in order to maintain compliance with Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines while ensuring only key personnel are entering the delivery room. Having a fully prepared back-up team outside the delivery room, which enters the room on an as needed basis only, could be beneficial to limit exposure. A pre-delivery multidisciplinary team huddle, with an optimal dissemination of medical history, estimated infant weight and clear roles assigned to individual NICU team members, especially for full neonatal codes, can be extremely helpful. A clear method of communication between team members inside and outside the delivery room should be established. Ensuring adequate supply of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and identifying a clear location where to procure them (ideally immediately outside and within identified labor and delivery rooms or the operative room)",
