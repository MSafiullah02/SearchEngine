It is intended as an aid for microbiologists, zoologists and epidemiologists, making possible better orientation among hosts (and reservoirs) of zoonoses. A great number of sources have been used in this compilation, e.g. The most common source of zoonoses for man are warm-blooded (endothermic, earlier called homeothermic) vertebrates, especially domestic and wild mammals, much less frequently birds, whereas only exceptionally cold-blooded (ectothermic, earlier called poikilothermic) vertebrates such as reptiles, amphibia and fishes.",

An amplifying host is a vertebrate enabling adequate propagation (amplification) of the agent after initial infection; the pathogen then occurs in sufficient concentration and for at least several days in the blood, urine or faeces of this host. The competent host is that vertebrate species which is able not only to amplify the agent but also to transmit it to a susceptible vertebrate host or haematophagous vector (in arthropod-borne diseases). For instance in Ebolavirus, many primate species are amplifying and competent (but not reservoir) hosts and a source of human infection, while some species of fruit bats are the reservoir (reservoir hosts).",

The hosts are also differentiated into categories of primary (principal) host (it guarantees circulation of the agent), secondary host (it is quite often included in the epizootic process), and accidental host (does not play any role in the epizootic process). Certain vertebrates -some birds (e.g., feral urban pigeon, starling, American blackbirds) and mammalian (bat) species -can serve as so-called \"lessors\" (Hub\u00e1lek 1994) of human-pathogenic agents (Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum) in that they provide for these pathogens an abiotic substrate (nest lining, droppings, guano) suitable for their propagation (an alternative term for a lessor could be a \"tenant\").",
