Patients aged >12 years, hospitalized in short-stay units, were randomly asked to complete a six-item self-administered questionnaire after giving their oral, informed consent. Three questions concerned the routes of inter-individual influenza transmission: aerial spread, direct contacts and indirect contacts. Three questions focused on means of prevention: wearing masks, hand washing and avoiding indirect contact through barrier measures detailed in the French national pandemic plan (http://www.sante.gouv.fr). Correct answers and concordance between knowledge on transmission and prevention underwent descriptive analysis with SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). According to our institution, the study did not need ethics committee approval because it was entirely observational.",

The male/female ratio was 0.87, and the median age was 39.5 years (range 26\u201356.75).\nTable I summarises the correct responses about knowledge of transmission and means of prevention. In total, 21.4% of patients had three correct answers about transmission routes and 34.8% had three correct answers about prevention. Also, the proportion of patients with three correct answers about prevention was higher than the proportion with three correct answers about transmission (not statistically significant: P\n = 0.059). Correct, concordant responses between each route of transmission and its corresponding prevention were 25% for direct contact and hand hygiene, 33% for indirect contact and avoidance of indirect contact, and 62% for the aerial route and mask wearing. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any additional significant results.",

Furthermore, they knew more about the means of preventing influenza than about the routes of transmission. Patient knowledge was also good in the area of respiratory transmission as the major route of infection.4 Transmission by contact seemed to be a minor route in seasonal influenza, which would explain the poor knowledge of patients about this transmission mode.5 However, transmission by contact may be significant in case of pandemic viruses, but we will not know that with certainty until putative pandemic viruses are identified.6 The difference between knowledge about transmission and prevention could be the result of prevention campaigns focused on standard hygiene more than on their justification. Santibanez et al. noted poorer knowledge of influenza and pneumonia transmission and prevention among the elderly population.7 We found higher proportions of correct answers, but our population was younger. Leung et al. reported greater knowledge of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome compared to our results on influenza.8 However, their study was conducted during an epidemic when the population was probably more aware of severe acute respiratory syndrome.",
