            "text": "Glycan-protein interactions occur at many physiological events, and the analyses are of considerable importance for understanding glycan-dependent mechanisms. Biophysical approaches including 3D structural analysis are essential for revealing glycan-protein interactions at the atomic level. The inherent diversity of glycans suits them to function as identification tags, e.g., distinguish self from the nonself components of pathogens. However, the complexity of glycans and poor affinities for interaction partners limit the usefulness of conventional analyses. To cope with such troublesome glycans, a logical sequence of biophysical analyses need to be developed. In this chapter, we introduce a workflow of glycan-protein interaction analysis consisting of six steps: preparation of lectin and glycan, screening of glycan ligand, determination of binding epitope, quantitative interaction analysis, 3D structural analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation. Our increasing knowledge and understanding of lectin-glycan interactions will hopefully lead to the design of glyco-based medicines and vaccines.",

Glycan complexity is potentially suitable for coding biological information, and interest is growing to \"decode\" the sugar codes. To this end, investigating glycan-protein interaction at the atomic level is a necessity as only then will we understand the detailed mechanisms of these glycan-mediated biological activities. Recent techniques introduced include glycan microarray analysis and other high-throughput screening methods, and now we can begin to have a more systematic approach to analyzing glycan-protein interactions.

Normally, 5-10 mg of purified protein is required. Bacterial expression systems are frequently used to express lectin domains in recombinant form ( Fig. 7.1a ), but obtaining large amounts of pure lectin in a soluble form is often difficult using bacterial expression systems. For instance, C-type lectin and C-type lectin-like domains contain three conserved disulfide bridges, and the cysteine residues hamper soluble expression with correct folding. Refolding of protein from inclusion bodies may be needed to produce functional lectin domains. The protein is solubilized and refolded under controlled conditions. This refolding procedure has been effective for the purification of mammalian C-type lectins and C-type lectin-like domains (Nagae et al. 2013b (Nagae et al. , 2014a (Nagae et al. , b, 2016b .",

In our laboratory, several fusion tags have been used, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1). Single chain Fv (scFv) originating from anti-carbohydrate MLS128 antibody was successfully expressed as a soluble form with PDI fusion (Subedi et al. 2012) , while the other fusion tags such as thioredoxin or disulfide isomerase DsbC were not sufficient to produce soluble scFv (Fig. 7.1b) . The expressed MLS128-scFv retains full binding activity toward synthetic carbohydrate antigens. The lectin domain of a C-type lectin-like receptor Dectin-1 was expressed as a GB1-fused protein (Dulal et al. 2016 ). The domain is correctly folded, is a monomer, and specifically binds a \u03b2-glucan ligand.

In these cases, mammalian expression systems may be necessary to express correctly folded proteins with posttranslational modifications.

For example, protein O-mannosyl kinase (POMK), which phosphorylates the mannose residue on \u03b1-dystroglycan, has three N-glycosylation Lanes 1 and 2 for scFv without fusion tag, Lanes 3 and 4 for thioredoxin (Trx)-fused scFv, Lanes 5 and 6 for DsbCfused scFv, and Lanes 7 and 8 for PDI-fused scFv.

Several methods can be used to prepare glycan ligands: (1) purification of a free natural glycan or liberation of a specific glycan from natural glycoconjugates (glycoprotein, glycolipid, etc.), (2) chemical synthesis, and (3) chemoenzymatic synthesis. Liberation of glycan from natural glycoprotein can yield large amounts of glycan provided that there is a plentiful supply of the natural glycoprotein. N-glycans attached onto glycoproteins can be liberated by chemical methods (e.g., hydrazinolysis) or by enzymatic methods (e.g., PNGase F) and then labeled with a fluorescent tag 2-aminopyridine for detection. Pyridylamino derivatives of oligosaccharides can be purified by HPLC, and their chemical structures confirmed by solution NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. For example, a biantennary N-glycan bearing bisecting GlcNAc was successfully purified with a yield of 120 \u03bcg from 200 mg of IgG and used for the analysis of a plant lectin E4-PHA (Nagae et al. 2014c (Nagae et al. , 2016b .

N-glycan core units in particular cannot be prepared easily by enzymatic approaches, and chemical synthesis plays a significant role (Hanashima et al. 2014b) . Synthetic bisected hexasaccharide has been used as ligand for the C-type lectin receptor murine DCIR2, the legume lectin PHA-E, and the plant lectin Calsepa.

            "text": "When doing the glycan microarray analysis, it is essential to immobilize a series of glycans onto the plate. The immobilization is one of the critical issues in the development of a glycan microarray. There are several ways to immobilize carbohydrate probes onto a suitable surface with retention of function. The chemically modified or unmodified glycans can be non-covalently or covalently attached onto the surface ( Fig. 7 .2a). Neoglycolipid (NGL) is an artificial glycolipid used to construct glycan microarrays via non-covalent interaction. In NGL technology, lipid-conjugated oligosaccharides prepared from natural sources or chemically synthesized are immobilized onto nitrocellulose-coated microarray slides (Palma et al. 2014) . In covalent immobilization, various chemical reactions have been developed (Hyun et al. 2017) . Among them, the conjugation reaction using amine-linked glycans is most widely used, and the Consortium for Functional Glycomics uses this chemistry for a glycan microarray platform (Fig. 7.2b) . Several different functional groups which react with amines are utilized such as cyanuric chloride, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS), and epoxide. Measuring lectin binding requires labeling of the lectin with a fluorescent probe or the use of an antibody. Even so carbohydrate-lectin interaction is often too weak to be detected. In such cases, oligomerization of the lectin is a strategy to enhance inherent weak binding. Interactions may be detected by introducing dimeric glutathione S-transferase (GST) into the lectin as a fusion tag, as in the case of a mammalian lectin ZG16p-binding immobilized glycans (Kanagawa et al. 2014; Hanashima et al. 2015) . Alternatively, it is possible to enhance binding by increasing the amount of surface glycans (Hanashima et al. 2015) . However, it should be noted that the density of immobilized glycans may affect the specificity of lectins (Horan et al. 1999) . Instead of fluorescence detection, label-free glycan biosensors have been developed to push the limit of detection (Hushegyi and Tkac 2014) .",

Moreover, effects of heterogeneous glycan mixing can be evaluated by immobilizing a mixture of glycans onto one spot (Liang et al. 2011 ). On-array inhibition assays can show if two different ligands bind competitively to the lectin (sharing a common binding site) or independently (each using a different binding site) ( Fig. 7 .2b) (Kanagawa et al. 2014) . Glycan microarrays can also evaluate direct binding of mammalian cells and viruses (Nimrichter et al. 2004; Song et al. 2011) , as well as biologically active glycans, if cell signaling can be linked to a fluorescent probe (Pai et al. 2016 ).

In addition, nonspecific binding is usually present, which contributes a background signal. Therefore it is preferable to include other screening methods to validate the results. Several methods have already been developed to screen glycans which bind target lectins. The thermal shift assay is widely used for ligand screening. In this approach, melting temperature is measured in the absence and the presence of ligands and any shifts assessed (Vedadi et al. 2006) . A temperature shift is indicative of increased stability acquired upon ligand binding. The purified protein is mixed with ligand in the presence of a fluorescent probe, such as SYPRO Orange, that binds to the denatured state. This method is simple and can be used for rapid ligand screening. Frontal affinity chromatography (FAC) can quantitatively evaluate weak interactions between lectins and glycans, as explained in the following section. The FAC method can also be used to screen for ligand binding. NMR is an excellent technique to determine the binding epitope of a lectin-glycan interaction. When the binding epitope is determined, a suitable ligand of minimum size is designed for use in X-ray crystallography. NMR can also be applied to high-throughput ligand screening (Meyer and Peters 2003) and be advantageously used with a mixture of binder and non-binders.",

The unique potential of NMR spectroscopy is its ability to generate high-resolution data not only on structure but also on dynamics and binding interactions. There are many types of NMR experiments that can be applied for very different experimental conditions both for the sample and the NMR parameters. NMR experiments provide various parameters such as chemical shifts, spin-spin couplings (J couplings), nuclear Overhauser effect (NOEs), and relaxation times. These parameters provide the atomic information on chemical environment, dihedral angles, distance, and mobility, respectively.

            "text": "Saturation transfer difference NMR (STD-NMR) spectroscopy is a method for studying protein-ligand interactions by observing signals emanating from the ligand (Mayer and Meyer 2001; Haselhorst et al. 2009 ). When the target protein is saturated with selective pulses, the saturation is transferred to a bound ligand through intermolecular 1 H-1 H cross relaxation (Fig. 7.3a ). Protons which are spatially close to the protein surface receive a higher degree of saturation compared with protons further away, and those on a non-binding ligand do not receive any saturation from the protein and are therefore not attenuated in the on-resonance spectrum. The subtraction of two spectra, one with protein resonance saturation (on-resonance) and the other without saturation of the protein resonance (off-resonance), results in a final STD-NMR spectrum showing only signals from bound ligands. For binding epitope analyses, the signal intensities of each peak are evaluated from an amplification factor (AF) = (I off -I on )/I off , where I on is the on-resonance signal intensity and I off is off-resonance signal intensity. Association constants can be estimated from a plot of AF against ligand concentration or initial growth rates of STD AF (Hanashima et al. 2010; Angulo et al. 2010) . STD-NMR requires only a small amount of native protein, and no expensive protein labeling is necessary. STD-NMR spectroscopy can be utilized to detect binding of ligands with K D values in the 10 \u22122 -10 \u22128 M range. Often screening for optimum STD-NMR conditions is required, such as probe temperature and optimal ligand-to-protein ratio ( Fig. 7.3b ). D 2 O solvent is preferred over H 2 O, to avoid direct and water-mediated saturation artifacts. High-affinity ligands typically reside longer within the protein binding site, undergo slow chemical exchange, and are thus not detectable by STD-NMR spectroscopy. 1D STD-NMR analysis is often hampered by severe overlapping of non-anomeric signals. For instance, the ring proton signals from the two branches (\u03b11-3 and \u03b11-6 branches) of bisected biantennary N-glycan largely overlap in 1D STD-NMR analysis. In contrast, the methyl proton signals from GlcNAc and core fucose are sharp The ligand protons which receive saturation from the protein are highlighted in red. From the degree of ligand saturation, one can map the group epitope which is recognized by the protein (b) STD-NMR spectra of (Neu5Ac) 6 with an anti-polysialic acid antibody 12E3 at 10 \u00b0C (ii), 20 \u00b0C (iii), and 30 \u00b0C (iv) with the control 1 H-NMR spectrum (off-resonance) at 10 \u00b0C (i). STD-NMR spectra were collected by irradiating iteratively at 7 ppm (on resonance)/ 40 ppm (off resonance).",

This figure was adapted from a previous paper (Nagae et al. 2014c ) with permission. Crystal structure of PHA-E in complex with bisected N-glycan (PDB code: 5AVA) is shown in right panel and well separated for certain glycans. Hence these signals can be used as a reliable probe for branch-specific epitope mapping as exemplified by an analysis of the interaction between biantennary bisected glycan and a legume lectin PHA-E (Nagae et al. 2014c ). The methyl proton signals of GlcNAc from outer branches and inner chitobiose unit show almost comparable intensities, indicating that the entire glycan contributes equally to binding with PHA-E (Fig. 7.3c) . Consistent with this result, the crystal structure of bisected glycan-PHA-E complex showed that most sugar residues of the glycan ligand are recognized by PHA-E (Fig. 7.3c, right panel) . Another approach is the use of 2D 1 H-13 C STD-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) to avoid the severe signal overlap in 1D NMR spectra. 2D STD-spectra have been collected to investigate the interaction between oligosialic acid and anti-oligosialic acid antibodies, 12E3 and A2B5 (Hanashima et al. 2013) . STD-NMR is also applicable to analyze multiple binding modes of a unique ligand in a single binding site (Angulo and Nieto 2011) .

            "text": "In solution NMR experiments, it is difficult to directly observe the hydroxyl protons of glycans because of their inherently fast exchange with water protons. Deuterium secondary isotope shifts on 13 C-chemical shifts (deuterium-induced 13 C isotope shifts, DIS) have been observed at the geminal 13 C-signal of exchangeable hydroxyl protons (Pfeffer et al. 1979 ). In the presence of H 2 O and D 2 O, the line shape of the 13 C-OH/D signal is highly dependent on the H/D exchange rate (Fig. 7.4a) . In a very slow H/D exchange environment, a deuterium-induced 13 C isotope shift (DIS) is observed in corresponding isotopomers, 13 C-OH and 13 C-OD, with a 0.09-0.15 ppm difference, whereas in the case of fast exchange, the equilibrium makes each isotopomer indistinguishable and gives a singlet signal at an averaged chemical shift. This NMR technique has been applied in the weak carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction of LewisX (Hanashima et al. 2011 ). LewisX, a trisaccharide of galactose, fucose and GlcNAc, is often found at the termini of glycolipids and glycoproteins and initiates cell-cell interactions by forming a LewisX-Ca 2+ complex (Eggens et al. 1989 ). Calcium-dependent intermolecular interactions of the LewisX-Ca 2+ complex are observed, via the proton exchange rates of each hydroxyl group in an equimolar H 2 O/D 2 O solution (Fig. 7.4b) . The conformation of the glycan ligand can also be analyzed by this method, including that of \u03b2(1,3)-glucan dependent on the degree of polymerization (DP) (Hanashima et al. 2014a) . With \u03b2-glucan, the exchange of 13 C-OH/D is dramatically retarded as DP extends, suggesting changes in quaternary structure (Fig. 7.4c) . Recently a new two-dimensional 1 H-13 C NMR method, named INTOXSY, was developed to estimate the H/D exchange rate constants of OH groups based on DIS (Battistel et al. 2017 ).",

Many quantitative biophysical methods exist to analyze lectinglycan interactions such as frontal affinity chromatography (FAC) analysis, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). All these methods can provide K d ; however, a suitable method needs to be selected for each purpose. Among them, ITC can be performed without labeling or immobilization of lectin or glycan. A lot of sample (typically 10 mmol for ligand and protein) is usually needed. In FAC analysis, immobilization of lectin is required, and the glycan must be labeled for detection.

The lectin was immobilized on the column, and a panel of pyridylaminated (PA) or p-nitrophenyl (pNP) glycans were successively passed through the column. In this way, Calsepa was found to specifically bind bisected N-glycans (Nagae et al. 2017a) (Fig. 7.5a) .

This antibody shows high affinity toward \u03b12-8-linked polysialic acid as the degree of polymerization (DP) increases. To investigate the DP-dependent affinity enhancement mechanism, a series of oligo (DP4-6) and polysialic acids (DP 80-130) and single chain Fv originating from antibody 735 (scFv735) were evaluated by ITC (Nagae et al. 2013a) (Fig. 7.5b) . As DP increases so does the affinity of scFv735. Thermodynamic parameters revealed that a large entropy loss upon interaction (T\u0394S = \u221272.7 kcal/mol for polysialic acid) is compensated for by a larger enthalpy gain (\u0394H = \u221280.1 kcal/mol). Importantly, the crystal structure of scFv735-ligand complex indicates that antibody 735 can recognize internal residues of polysialic acids (Fig. 7.5b, right) .

X-ray crystallography is the favored method to determine the 3D structures of proteinligand complexes at atomic resolution.

In contrast, solution NMR analyses such as titration assays and transferred nuclear Overhauser effects (trNOE) can give a more realistic picture under physiological conditions. Titration assays provide affinities, while trNOEs give intramolecular distance constraints of the bound glycan. This chapter focuses on NMR analysis of lectin-glycan interaction.",

Docking simulations of lectin-glycan complexes provide a theoretical foundation and reduce ambiguities in experimental results. We validated the accuracy of docking simulation by applying it to a crystal structure of POMK-ligand complex, in which the electron density of ligand was partially observed (Fig. 7.7a ). The position of the trisaccharide ligand in the docking model coincides well with the fragmented electron density in the crystal structure, underscoring the usefulness of docking and MD simulations in determining bound structures (Nagae et al. 2017b ). MD simulation is also useful for validation of possible binding modes with the estimation of binding free energy. Orysata lectin, one of the mannose-binding Fig. 7 .6 (continued) trNOEs were also observed from Man-3 H1 to GlcNAc-5\u2032 (\u03b11-6 branch) H1 and to Man-4' H2 signals (Right panel). Proton-proton distances were indicated between Man-3 H1 and GlcNAc-5' H1 and between Man-3 H1 and Man-4' H2. Structures of back-fold conformations are derived from Calsepa complex (PDB code: 5AV7). Hydrogen atoms are generated with PyMOL. This figure was adapted and modified from a paper (Nagae et al. 2016c) with permission (f) 2D 1 H-1 H NOESY spectrum of PIM1 glycan (4.6-fold excess) in the presence of wild-type ZG16p collected with a mixing time of 250 ms at 10 \u00b0C (upper panel). Key inter-residual correlation was provided between Man-H1 and Ino-H2 and intra-residual correlations (Man-H1 and Man-H2) as negative NOEs. The atomic distance of inter-residue Man-H1-Ino-H2 was determined as 2.2 \u00c5 from the relative intensity of the signal. No correlation was observed when using the inactive ZG16p mutant (D151N) (lower panel). This figure is reproduced from the paper (Hanashima et al. 2015) with permission Jacalin-related lectins, shows a preference for complex-type glycans with a \u03b11-6 branch extension rather than a \u03b11-3 branch. It was not easy to understand the structural basis for the preference for the \u03b11-6 branch from the \"snap-shot\" crystal structure of Orysata in complex with biantennary glycan. MD simulations yield the dynamic behavior of the glycan attached to Orysata lectin (Fig. 7.7b) . Several docking models of Orysata in complex with a series of N-glycans were constructed, and the calculated binding free energies suggest that multiple binding modes exist in the solution, and the binding preference seems somehow to originate from an average of multiple binding modes that favors \u03b11-6 branch binding (Fig. 7.7c) . MD simulations are especially useful for analyzing such multiple ligand-binding modes.",

            "text": "Recent improvement in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a great breakthrough for structural biology (Cheng et al. 2015) . EM analysis has an inherent advantage for investigating the global conformations of macromolecules, rather than atomic details of local interfaces. The structural changes of glycans on glycoproteins affect the physiological functions of carrier glycoproteins. This has been clearly exemplified by EM analysis. For example, EM has shown that mutation or elimination of N-glycans affects the conformational equilibrium of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin (Li et al. 2017) . Likewise, the inter-domain angle of LDL-receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is regulated by the evolutionarily conserved N-glycan (Matoba et al. 2017) . In X-ray crystallography, the trimming of surface glycans on glycoproteins by glycosidase is usually necessary to produce diffraction quality crystals (Chang et al. 2007) . Mutations at N-glycosylation sites can also produce highly uniform proteins (Nagae et al. 2017b) . However, such treatments prevent visualization of the atomic structure of glycans, although some native glycoproteins provide good glycan electron density due to extensive intramolecular interactions between glycan and carrier glycoproteins (Nagae and Yamaguchi 2012) . In contrast, there is no need to eliminate the surface glycans of glycoproteins in single particle analysis of cryo-EM. Thus, cryo-EM has great potential to provide the atomic structure of native glycans. Actually, cryo-EM structures of glycoproteins, such as \u03b3-secretase and human coronavirus, often include the coordinates of attached glycans (Bai et al. 2015; Walls et al. 2016) (Fig. 7.8a and b) . Even tetra-antennary N-glycan structures are visible in the EM map of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimer (Env) (Lee et al. 2016) (Fig. 7.8c) .",
