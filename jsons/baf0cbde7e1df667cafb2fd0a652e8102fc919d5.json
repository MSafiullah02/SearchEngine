Contrary to the classical teachings of the \"golden hour,\" in patients with severe truncal hemorrhage, peak mortality occurs at 30 min [2] . For patients who survive long enough to make it to a hospital, the median time to death from hemorrhage is 90-150 min after admission [1, 3] . The lethal triad of hypothermia, acidosis, and acute coagulopathy of trauma is well recognized as a common pathway to irreversible shock and death [4, 5] . Rapid treatment utilizing damage control resuscitation (DCR) with blood components mimicking whole blood in the setting of permissive hypotension, avoiding crystalloid and colloid, followed by prompt surgical hemorrhage control, is the best strategy to prevent traumatic hemorrhagic death and the onset of the lethal triad [1, 4, 6, 7] . Plasma transfusion is an essential part of this approach and remains a significant logistical challenge even today, hence the need for a reliable, shelf-stable, easy-to-carry and administer plasma product such as dried plasma.",

            "text": "The role of plasma in DCR has been reaffirmed time and time again. In 1945, Beecher noted that \"Plasma gives more time to get whole blood into the patient\" [8] . Multiple US large center retrospective cohorts showed that 24-28% of severely injured trauma patients are found to be coagulopathic on admission. Coagulopathic patients have significantly higher mortality rates, while the degree of coagulopathy correlated with the severity of injury [9] [10] [11] . Analysis of the German Trauma Registry yielded similar results with rates of coagulopathy up to 34% as well as a direct correlation between the amount of crystalloid received prehospital and an increasing degree of coagulopathy [12] . Looking back at the first decade of war in Iraq, 33% of combat casualties were coagulopathic on admission, which correlated with a fivefold increase in mortality [13] . These data highlight the importance of recognizing the early onset of the coagulopathy of trauma at the time of injury, as well as endothelial damage, which plasma has been shown to correct [14] . Therefore, correction of coagulopathy should not be delayed until laboratory values are available to guide therapy and goals of care. The approach to the trauma patient should aim at preventing and correcting this coagulopathy as soon as possible to decrease its effects on mortality and progression of shock.",

During this conflict, over 335,000 units of blood products were transfused with nearly 110,000 being plasma [16, 17] . Analysis of combat casualties over 10 years revealed improved survival in those receiving a higher ratio of plasma and platelets to blood [13] . By 2010, clinical practice guidelines implemented by the Department of Defense (DoD) led to almost 100% of combat massive transfusions to be at a 1:1:1 ratio [18] . The PROMMTT trial then showed that early plasma administration was associated with reduced mortality in the first 6 h [3] . Following that, the PROPPR trial demonstrated that patients transfused with a higher plasma ratio achieved more hemostasis and had less early death due to exsanguination [19] .",

In a large civilian cohort from a level 1 trauma center, prehospital administration of blood products including RBCs and plasma has been shown to be feasible and beneficial with improved acid-base status on admission and decreased overall blood product use in 24 h as well as a reduction in the risk of death in the sickest patients over the first 6 h [22] .

It is important to use plasma as the primary resuscitation fluid for patients who are bleeding [4] . Other benefits of plasma stem from its ability to mitigate the effects of shock on physiology. The role of plasma in the correction of the endotheliopathy of trauma has been reported in multiple studies and is likely more important than correcting coagulopathy. The mechanism of action is thought to be through promoting systemic vascular stability and preventing endothelial permeability, coagulopathy, and inflammation which eventually lead to shock and end-organ failure [24, 25] . Moreover, in a rat model of injury and shock, plasma was able to restore the endothelial glycocalyx, improve syndecan-1 expression, and correct lung injury caused by shock [26] .",

In the USA, half of all trauma patients are cared for outside of levels 1 and 2 trauma centers, where blood products are frequently not readily available [32] . In the military, forward surgical teams (FST) were developed to provide immediate support and treatment to injured soldiers. They used to only carry red blood cells (RBCs) for transfusion, and more recently, they are able to provide plasma but not platelets [33] . Warm fresh whole blood (WFWB) is available in these circumstances and has been shown to improve survival in combat casualties treated by FST [33] . These challenges, along with misconceptions regarding the role of blood products in resuscitation, led to the overuse of crystalloids and its own set of unique complications. Excessive crystalloid resuscitation has been shown to be detrimental, while balanced blood product resuscitation decreases the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and abdominal compartment syndrome and improves survival [32, 34] .",

The logistical difficulties in providing FFP transfusions early in trauma are based on the need for reliable cold storage facilities, specialized transport equipment and personnel to provide them, and a lengthy thawing process.

Elliot utilized pooling by mixing the plasma of up to eight donors together to neutralize anti-A and anti-B antibodies and eliminate the need for cross-matching [38, 40] . Reports of treating shock with dried plasma go back as early as 1938 [41] . In 1940, the British Army called upon the American Red Cross to provide plasma shipped directly to London, and the blood plasma for Great Britain project started [42, 43] . The \"Blood for Britain\" campaign resulted in almost 15,000 units of blood donated from 1940 to 1941 in New York City alone with the majority used to produce liquid plasma, while the RBCs and platelets were discarded. The program was then stopped due to high incidence of bacterial contamination in liquid plasma [42, 43] .",

Lyophilization is achieved by freezing the plasma under a vacuum in a glass container for several days, which decreases the water content to 1-2% [45] . Spray-dried plasma production utilizes atomization of liquid plasma via pressurized drying gas to droplets which are then exposed to hot gas (up to 150 \u00b0C) in a drying chamber followed by rapid evaporative cooling. This method can dry a unit of plasma (~250 mL) in approximately 25 min [17, 46] . Dried plasma can then be reconstituted to its original volume or a concentrated form. Multiple pathogen inactivation methods are available to use during the process, and the choice depends on the manufacturer's preference and experience.",

S/D treatment, which is FDA-approved, binds lipid-enveloped viruses and bacteria to inactivate them followed by a filtration process to remove cells and debris, but it has no effect against non-enveloped viruses and prions [48] . Rigorous screening standards require testing donors for non-enveloped viruses twice at a 6-month interval to decrease the risk of transmission. Moreover, photochemical inactivation utilizes a photosensitizer that binds the DNA and RNA of pathogens, including non-enveloped viruses, and nucleated cells, followed by ultraviolet light exposure to inactivate them [49] . INTERCEPT (Cerus Corp., Concord, CA) is an FDA-approved system, which uses amotosalen (a psoralen molecule) to bind DNA and RNA followed by UV light activation [50] . The Mirasol System (Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO), which uses riboflavin as the photosensitizer, is currently approved for clinical use in Europe but only approved for investigational use in the USA and Canada [51] .

In another study, fresh whole blood (FWB), FFP, and LP all corrected coagulopathy equally in a swine model. There was 85% mortality in the crystalloid only group and no mortality in any of the blood products groups [66] . Another study showed that when compared with colloid alone, 7-day survival was superior in animals that received spray-dried plasma -this effect was equivalent to that seen in animals that received whole blood [70] . Moreover, animals receiving balanced LP-to-RBC had significantly less blood loss than those receiving FFP or LP alone, and LP was as effective as FFP in reversing coagulopathy in this animal model [55] .",

This led to higher levels of fibrinogen achieved within 45 min of randomization, as well as a greater improvement in INR, factor V, and factor II levels. The difference in coagulation parameters between the two groups remained significant at 6 h. However, there was no difference detected in mortality between the two groups [88] .",

After storage at 2-8 \u00b0C for 24 months, LyoPlas N-w only had a 10% reduction in factor V, VIII, and vWF. All other factors remained stable. Storage at room temperature, however, led to 54% decrease in fibrinogen levels and vWF activity. This is why the shelf life of LyoPlas N-w has been restricted to 15 months only. After reconstitutions, factor degradation increases over time at room temperature. At 48 h, factor VIII and protein S levels decreased by 66 and 50%, respectively. Only 10% degradation of those factors was noted in the first 6 h, however. This is why it is recommended to use LyoPlas N-w within 6 h of reconstitution [45] . ",

These measures are costly and require a large-scale operation. Smaller hospitals will not be able to accommodate such measures. Patients presenting to such facilities will suffer worse outcomes from delay in administration of plasma until it is available or until transported to a larger center. Physicians are forced to use crystalloid and colloid in such situations to stabilize patients. Furthermore, trauma casualties in remote locations requiring long transport times or austere environments requiring prolonged extrication will be at a huge disadvantage.

This reflects the wide use of LyoPlas N-w in Germany (41% of all plasma used) under various clinical settings requiring transfusion and not just trauma resuscitation. The rates and types of transfusion-related complications reported between 2007 and 2011 were similar for FFP and LyoPlas N-w (0.018 vs. 0.023%).
