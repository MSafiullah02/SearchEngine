Host defense against IA relies on lung-infiltrating neutrophils and 30 monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic 31 cells (pDCs), which are prototypically anti-viral cells, participate in innate immune crosstalk 32 underlying mucosal antifungal immunity. Aspergillus-infected murine Mo-DCs and neutrophils 33 recruited pDCs to the lung by releasing the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in a Dectin-34 1/Card9-and type I and III interferon-signaling dependent manner, respectively. During 35 aspergillosis, circulating pDCs entered the lung in response to CXCR3-dependent signals. Via 36 targeted pDC ablation, we found that pDCs were essential for host defense in the presence of 37 normal neutrophil and Mo-DC numbers. Although interactions between pDC and fungal cells 38",

Since depletion of CCR2 + cells diminished 63 neutrophil antifungal activity, two models could explain these findings. First, CCR2 + monocytes 64 and Mo-DCs could release mediators that act directly on neutrophils to enhance antifungal 65 effector functions. Second, CCR2 + monocytes and Mo-DCs could mediate the recruitment or 66 activation of a third cellular constituent that conditions the lung inflammatory milieu 67 independent of contributions from CCR2 + monocytes and their derivatives. Here, we provide 68 evidence for the second model and identify pDCs as a third leukocyte constituent that is essential 69 for innate immune crosstalk and host defense against A. fumigatus in an otherwise immune 70 competent host. 71 The mechanism by which pDCs contribute to antifungal immunity in the lung remains an 72 open question. In vitro, human pDCs may spread over A. fumigatus hyphae to blunt fungal 73 metabolic activity, and, in rare instances, undergo a cell death process that may result in 74 extracellular traps (Loures et al., 2015; Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2011). Mice treated with a mAb 75 (i.e., a-PDCA-1/CD317) that primarily targets pDCs in the steady state, but likely targets 76 additional leukocyte subsets under inflammatory conditions (Blasius et al., 2006), are susceptible 77",

In this study, we demonstrate a three-cell circuit that 278 involves pDCs, monocytes and derivative Mo-DCs, and neutrophils to regulate sterilizing 279 immunity against Aspergillus conidia. This circuit acts as a feedforward amplification 280 mechanism, by coupling fungal recognition and fungus-induced inflammation to CXCR3 281 signaling-dependent pDC recruitment in the lung. pDCs regulate neutrophil ROS induction and 282 fungal killing to mediate sterilizing immunity at the respiratory barrier. 283",

In humans and mice, sterilizing immunity against A. fumigatus conidia depends 50 on the action of myeloid cells, primarily neutrophils, lung-infiltrating monocytes and monocyte-51 derived DCs (Mo-DCs), as well as alveolar macrophages; all lymphoid cells are redundant for 52 host defense (Espinosa et al., 2014; Hohl et al., 2009; Latge and Chamilos, 2019; Mircescu et al., 53",

            "text": "288remains an open question for future studies. Prior studies identified a polymorphism in the 289 Cxcl10 gene as a risk factor for IA in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant patients(Fisher et  290   al., 2017; Mezger et al., 2008). In this cohort, patients with IA had higher CXCL10 serum levels 291 than controls that did not develop IA, consistent with the idea that pulmonary fungal infection 292 induces CXCL10, similar to findings in mice in this work. Furthermore, the high-risk haplotype 293 was associated with reduced Cxcl10 mRNA expression by immature DCs (iDCs) co-cultured 294with Aspergillus germlings compared to wild-type iDCs(Mezger et al., 2008). Thus, human 295 iDCs and murine lung Mo-DCs both responded to A. fumigatus challenge by transcribing Cxcl10 296 mRNA. Although this process is generally regulated by IFN signaling in both mammalian 297 species (O'Connell et al., 2019;Ohmori et al., 1993), a recent study by Rivera and colleagues 298 defined essential roles for type I and type III, but not type II, IFNs in murine host defense against 299A. fumigatus(Espinosa et al., 2017). One model to account for these findings is that an early 300 wave of type I interferon signaling, detected as early as 6 h pi in the lung and produced primarily 301 by CCR2 + lung-infiltrating monocytes and Mo-DCs(Espinosa et al., 2017), may drive CXCL10 302 release in the lung in a paracrine or autocrine manner, as observed in this study. In accordance 303 with this model, CXCL10 lung levels that peak at 48 h pi are dependent on type I and type III 304 IFN receptor signal transduction in the Aspergillus-infected murine lung. 305Although IFN-dependent and -independent stimuli can induce CXCL9 during microbial 306 infection(Forero et al., 2019;Groom and Luster, 2011), previous studies have not directly linked 307 C-type lectin receptor signaling to fungus-induced CXCL9 production. In murine models of 308 experimental cryptococcosis with a wild-type or a recombinant vaccine strain that expresses 309 human IFN-g fungal infection led to lung CXCL9 and CXCL10 production, though the identity 310 of chemokine-producing cells was not investigated(Hole et al., 2016; Yamamoto et al., 2014). In 311 this model, Card9 -/mice had lower lung CXCL9 levels than control mice. This finding was 312 attributed to reduced lung infiltration of IFN-g-producing NK and CD4 + T cells because 313Cryptococcus-stimulated BM-DCs failed to produce either cytokine in vitro(Yamamoto et al.,  314   2014). In contrast, splenic and central nervous system (CNS)-resident Mo-DCs produced copious 315 levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 during murine cerebral malaria(Hirako et al., 2016). Because a 316 significant fraction of CXCL9 + CXCL10 + splenic Mo-DCs contained hemozoin, a malarial 317 pigment, this study supported the idea that microbial uptake regulated CXCR3 ligand release 318 either directly or indirectly in infected cells. The authors provided evidence for indirect CXCL9 and CXCL10 regulation since their secretion was highly dependent on intact IFN-g receptor 320 signaling. In the case of respiratory A. fumigatus infection, the dual regulation of CXCL9 by 321Dectin-1/Card9 and CXCL10 by type I and type III IFN signaling indicates both direct and 322 indirect regulation of distinct CXCR3 ligands by a pathogen-associated molecular pattern 323 receptor and soluble type I and type III IFNs. 324 CXCR3 ligands have been studied extensively in the context of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell 325 trafficking in peripheral lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, in part due to high CXCR3 326 expression on effector and memory T cell subsets, in contrast to na\u00efve T cells(Qin et al., 2011).327 In draining LNs, antigen-activated and transferred DCs express CXCL9 and CXCL10 and 328 thereby regulate the frequency of IFN-g + CD4 + T cells, linking the CXCR3 signaling axis to the 329 formation of effector Th1 cells (Groom et al., 2012). CXCR3 facilitated the entry of effector T 330 cells into otherwise restricted sites, exemplified by CXCR3 + CD8 + T cells infiltration of the CNS 331 or genital tract during murine malaria, West Nile virus, or herpes simplex virus 2 infection 332 (Hirako et al., 2016; Nakanishi et al., 2009; Thapa and Carr, 2009; Thapa et al., 2008). During 333 bacterial infection, a study reported that CXCR3 signaling regulated neutrophil influx to the 334 infected cecum and thus controlled Salmonella extra-intestinal dissemination (Chami et al., 335 2017). In rodent models of viral (e.g., influenza virus or coronavirus) or chemical acute 336 respiratory distress syndrome, CXCL10 + lung-infiltrating neutrophils and CXCL9 + macrophages 337 mediated the recruitment of tissue-destructive CXCR3 + neutrophils; this pathologic process was 338 ameliorated in Cxcr3 -/or Cxcl10 -/mice (Ichikawa et al., 2013). During respiratory fungal 339 challenge, we did not observe CXCR3 expression on lung-infiltrating neutrophils and neutrophil 340 recruitment was unaffected in Cxcr3 -/mice compared to control mice. In more recent work in 341 the Salmonella model, infected splenic macrophages reside in T cell-sparse granulomas but are surrounded by mononuclear phagocytes that release CXCL9 and CXCL10 to recruit antigen-343 specific CXCR3 + Th1 cells for bacterial containment (Goldberg et al., 2018). Thus, CXCR3 344 ligands target both innate and adaptive immune cells in a highly context-dependent manner; this 345 process can result in microbial containment or microbe-elicited tissue damage. 346 pDCs originate in the bone marrow (BM), circulate in the blood, and traffic to lymphoid 347 and nonlymphoid tissues under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions (Fujimura et al., 2015; 348 Sozzani et al., 2010; Swiecki et al., 2017). However, the mechanism that couples microbial 349 recognition to pDC accumulation at peripheral sites has remained poorly understood. During 350 respiratory fungal infection, neither CCR2 + monocytes nor CCR2neutrophils had the capacity 351 to respond to CXCR3 ligands because these cells do not express CXCR3. Thus, the recruitment 352 of lung-infiltrating monocytes and pDCs occurs via a pathway that bifurcated after the initial 353 CCR2-dependent egress from the bone marrow reservoir. Although the precise cues that regulate 354 the CXCR3-independent entry of circulating monocytes into the fungus-infected lung remain 355 unknown, integrin-mediated mechanisms enable monocytic influx into hepatic foci of Listeria 356 monocytogenes during systemic infection (Shi et al., 2010). 357 During other types of lung infections, e.g. influenza and RSV, pDCs traffic to the lungs and 358 draining LNs of mice (Langlois and Legge, 2010; Smit et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006) via 359 pathways that are distinct compared to conventional DCs (Sawai et al., 2013; Sozzani et al., 360 2010). For example, pDC LN trafficking during murine influenza is regulated primarily by L-361 selectin (CD62L), with contributions from CXCR3 and CXCR4. Further pDC positioning within 362 the LN is mediated by CCR7 and the release of pDC-derived CXCR3 ligands to enable the 363 formation of clusters of pDCs that interact and activate cells of the adaptive immune system 364 (Krug et al., 2002). In contrast, we did not observe pDC-dependent release of CXCL9 and 365 CXCL10 in the Aspergillus-infected lung, consistent with the model that pDC recruitment cues 366 depends on heterologous myeloid cells. Beyond CXCR3, L-selectin, and CXCR4, the E-selectin 367 ligands, b1 and b2 integrins, CCR5, CCR7, and the chemerin receptor ChemR23 have been 368 implicated in pDC trafficking during states of inflammation (Diacovo et al., 2005; Kohrgruber et 369 al., 2004; Sozzani et al., 2010; Vanbervliet et al., 2003; Wendland et al., 2007), though it has 370 remained unclear how individual cues cooperate to guide distinct pDC trafficking steps, and 371 what the relative strength of individual cues is for defined tissue destinations and types of 372 inflammatory stimuli. The sequential requirements for CCR2 and CXCR3 signaling in distinct 373 pDC trafficking steps during respiratory A. fumigatus infection provides a combinatorial model, 374 in which a more general cue for myeloid cell bone marrow egress (i.e., CCR2 that acts on 375 monocytes and pDCs) is combined with a more specific, pDC-targeted cue (i.e., CXCR3). The 376 latter cue emanates primarily from CCR2 + Mo-DCs that were not equipped to control fungal 377 tissue invasion or license the full spectrum of neutrophil antifungal activity per se. 378 pDCs were functionally characterized as mediators of antiviral defense (Assil et al., 2019; 379 Swiecki and Colonna, 2010). Recent studies have expanded their role to anti-bacterial (e.g., 380 Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus) (Ang et al., 2010; 381 Crother et al., 2012; Parcina et al., 2013) and to anti-fungal defense (Ang et al., 2010; Hole et al., 382 2016). pDC-mediated antiviral responses are stimulated upon physical contact with infected cells 383 (Assil et al., 2019). pDCs adhere to infected cells via \u03b1 L \u03b2 2 integrin/ICAM-1 interactions, during 384 which viral RNA is transferred to pDCs, leading to IFN production via the nucleic acid sensor 385 TLR7. This process activates type I IFN-dependent antiviral programs in infected tissues. During 386 respiratory fungal infection, lung-infiltrating pDCs do not interact directly with Aspergillus 387 conidia, but instead regulate neutrophils ROS induction. Our study does not exclude the possibility that Aspergillus-or host cell-derived nucleic acids activate pDCs in the lung in situ. 389 Prior work has demonstrated that Aspergillus-derived unmethylated CpG sequences can activate 390 TLR9 signaling in vitro (Herbst et al., 2015; Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2008). Alternatively, pDCs 391 may recognize fungal Dectin-2/CLEC4N or Dectin-3/CLEC4E ligands (Loures et al., 2015; 392 Maldonado and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 2017; Preite et al., 2018). In patients with systemic lupus 393 erythematosus, neutrophil-derived extracellular traps (NETs) activate pDCs by releasing DNA-394 protein complexes, resulting in TLR9-dependent release of pathologic type I IFNs during 395 autoimmunity (Garcia-Romo et al., 2011; Lande et al., 2011). While A. fumigatus conidia are 396 poor inducers of NETosis, products of germination, specifically hyphae that are too large to be 397 phagocytosed, are potent stimuli for NETosis (Bianchi et al., 2009; Bruns et al., 2010; Gibrat et 398 al., 1989). Thus, pDC activation in the fungus-infected lung likely occurs by multiple, yet 399 undefined mechanisms. 400 The molecular basis for pDC-neutrophil crosstalk represents an important area of future 401 investigation. Two non-exclusive models are likely operative. First, pDCs may form direct 402 contact with neutrophils after arriving at the site of infection. In this model, an individual pDC 403 would interact with many neutrophils since neutrophils are ~100 times more prevalent in the 404 lung at 48 h pi compared to pDCs. The relative paucity of pDCs, compared to other infiltrating 405 myeloid cells (i.e., neutrophils, Mo-DCs), makes it unlikely that direct pDC-mediated 406 fungistasis, observed at high effector to target cell ratios in the test tube, is physiologically 407 significant in the fungus-infected lung (Loures et al., 2015; Maldonado and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 408 2017). Second, either fungus-triggered or host cell-triggered pDC activation may result in the 409 release of soluble mediators that boost neutrophil fungicidal activity. Previous studies have 410 identified GM-CSF, type I IFN, and type III IFN as important regulators of neutrophil NADPH 411 oxidase activity during respiratory A. fumigatus and B. dermatiditis challenge (Espinosa et al., 412 2017; Hernandez-Santos et al., 2018; Kasahara et al., 2016).

            "text": "415 cannot be compensated by the presence of other myeloid cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, 416 and Mo-DCs. In fact, fungus-engaged Mo-DCs and neutrophils harness pDCs as a feedforward 417 amplification mechanism to enhance innate antifungal activity in the lung by coupling fungal 418 recognition and fungus-induced inflammation to the CXCR3 signaling-dependent recruitment of 419 pDCs into the fungus-infected lung. In the lung pDCs regulate neutrophil ROS induction, a 420 process that induces a regulated cell death process in mold conidia (Shlezinger et al., 2017). Our 421 findings indicate that pDC recovery following administration of chemotherapy and in bone 422 marrow transplant recipients may represent an important variable that affects infectious 423 susceptibility not just to viral, but also to fungal pathogens. Recent studies in bone marrow 424 transplant patients indicate that donor pDC reconstitution in the recipient is associated with 425 favorable clinical outcomes, including non-relapse mortality from unrelated donors (Goncalves 426 et al., 2015; Waller et al., 2019; Waller et al., 2014). These data raise the possibility that pDC 427 recovery in bone marrow transplant patients may be important for controlling systemic fungal 428 infections. Further studies to decipher the mechanistic role of pDCs in antifungal immunity is 429 likely to inform strategies to harness these cells for prophylactic or therapeutic gain in vulnerable 430 patient populations.
