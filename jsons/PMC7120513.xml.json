            "text": " Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)\u2014Despite aggressive and supportive management, pneumonias that arise from hospital settings remain a challenging and enduring clinical entity. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is defined as pneumonia in patients hospitalized for 2 or more days but who did not appear to have pneumonia on admission. The earlier designation of healthcare associated pneumonia was removed from the 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS); while patients with recent contact with healthcare settings are at increased risk of infection with multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms, this population of patients should have their antimicrobial therapy determined by clinical context [1]. Ventilator-associated pneumoniais defined as a new pneumonia in those patients who have been intubated for at least 2\u20133 days. Features of VAP include worsening radiographic opacities, increasing secretions, bronchospasm or hemoptysis, and worsening gas exchange on the ventilator. While early treatment is essential, rapid de-escalation of antibiotics in the face of negative culture results is also important. Sampling of the respiratory tract is necessary to further guide management; samples may be obtained either through tracheobronchial aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), mini-BAL, or protected specimen brush (PSB). Careful observation of individual hospitals\u2019 bacterial antibiogram is essential to provide treatment targeted to the resistance profile of each institution. The most common MDR pathogens include P. aeruginosa, Escheriochia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Acinetobacter species as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus [1].",

Zilberberg and colleagues found thatamong nearly 400 patients alive at 48 h with hospital-acquired pneumonia, inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy was associated with a significant increase in mortality (30% vs. 18.3%, p = 0.013; OR 2.88 95% CI 1.46\u20135.67 in multivariable logistic regression). Treatment escalation did not change the risk of death in this single-center study [2]. Unfortunately, treatment is often delayed. In one study among 107 patients, 30.7% of patients had their therapy for VAP inappropriately delayed, defined as \u226524 h passing between VAP onset and providing the appropriate antimicrobial treatment. A delay in writing the antibiotic orders was the primary reason for delay in therapy in 75% of cases [3]. Endotracheal aspirate is the preferred means of sampling, prior to or at the time of antibiotic initiation, as multiple studies have demonstrated that this technique is equivalent to bronchoscopy with regards to patient outcomes and antibiotic exposure [4, 5].",

While the data are inconsistent regarding the clinical utility of these biomarkers [15], procalcitonin levels may help inform decisions to de-escalate antibiotic therapy. In subgroup analyses of the PRORATA trial, investigators found that patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia assigned to the study arm (where antibiotics were discontinued after PCT levels reached <0.5 \u03bcg) had 3.1 fewer days (95% CI 0.7 days\u20145.6 days) of antibiotics than those patients assigned to the control arm, without a difference in mortality [16]. In contrast, a multicenter randomized control trial of 1656 patients cared for initially in the emergency department for pneumonia had no difference in duration of antibiotic use when treatment decisions were guided by PCT, although under half of patients were hospitalized in this population [17]. Other studies that have looked at procalcitonin to guide therapy for undifferentiated septic shock or in broader settings have replicated that mortality does not appear to be affected when procalcitonin is used to guide therapy, although the findings on duration of antibiotics is more heterogeneous [18, 19].",

Whether to pursue bronchoscopic sampling (or other invasive techniques) is more controversial. Endotracheal aspirates are very sensitive\u2014a negative result is quite helpful because it has a high negative predictive value. Positive results can be harder to interpret. In one study of 52 episodes of pneumonia, endotracheal aspirate was found to have a sensitivity of 97.7% and specificity of 50% as compared with protected brush specimen [20]. Other studies have employed the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) with a cut-off of 6 as a noninvasive method of identifying patients with VAP, using autopsy findings of pneumonia as the gold standard (Table 29.1) [21]. Fabregas et al. found a score of greater than 6 had a sensitivity of 77% but a specificity of 42% [22]. Conversely, bronchoscopic sampling may be less sensitive but is more specific for pneumonia. Randomized controlled trials are mixed. An RCT of 413 patients found no benefit to invasive sampling in unadjusted analyses, but did after adjustment for baseline factors [23]. A more recent RCT of 740 patients found no benefit to bronchoalveolar lavage over endotracheal aspirate [5]. Our practice is to perform immediate endotracheal aspirate in all patients with suspected VAP, but to reserve bronchoalveolar lavage or protected brush for selected cases, consistent with the IDSA/ATS guidelines but in contrast to the European Respiratory Society guidelines [1, 24].",

One prospective trial of 1184 patients suggested that linezolid may be superior to vancomycin. In this study, 46% of patients treated with vancomycin had cultures persistently positive forMRSA, while only 17% of patients treated with linezolid did. At 60 days, however, there was no difference in mortality rates, although nephrotoxicity did occur at greater rates with vancomycin [25]. As research in this space continues to evolve, linezolid may be a particularly good option among patients with renal failure.",

For example, for patients with P. aeruginosa VAP who remain in shock or high-risk of death when antibiotic susceptibilities are known, the ATS/IDSA guidelines recommend combination therapy rather than monotherapy [1]. However, it is worth noting that synergy of medications has only been demonstrated in vitro and in neutropenic or bacteremic patients and randomized controlled trials have not demonstrate differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy groups [7, 26, 27]. An observational cohort study in Lancet suggested combination therapy may be harmful, as the cohort of patients with ATS/IDSA-compliant antimicrobial therapy had a higher risk of death at 28 days than the noncompliant group [28]. This remains controversial, whether these individuals were at higher risk of death from the medications, the infections, or misidentification of them as at higher risk for MDR infection.",

Further, it is designed to be reliable as it is solely based on any changes made to the ventilator that would indicate worsening oxygenation after a period of stability and at least 3 days into the course of mechanical ventilation. Review of radiology has been removed from the definition.

In contrast, Boudma and colleagues found ventilator-associated condition to be reasonably sensitive at identifying episodes of VAP (0.92) but not specific (0.28) [43]. Further, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome is likely to be captured alongside VAP under the larger label of VAE [42, 44].
