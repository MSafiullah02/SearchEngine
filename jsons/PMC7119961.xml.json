The M protein is a type III glycoprotein consisting of a short amino-terminal ectodomain, a triple-spanning transmembrane domain, and a long carboxyl-terminal inner domain (Rottier, 1995). The ORF2 encodes for a glycosilated protein (S) ranging from 1160 to 1452 amino acids (aa) in length (Enjuanes et al., 2000), constituting the large, petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion. This large protein can be divided into three structural domains. The large external domain at the N-terminus is divided further into two subdomains S1 and S2. The S1 sub-domain includes the N-terminal half of the molecule and forms the globular portion of the spikes. It contains sequences that are responsible for binding to specific receptors on the membrane of susceptible cells. S1 sequences are variable, containing various degrees of deletions and substitutions in different coronavirus strains or isolates. Mutations in the S1 region have been associated with altered antigenicity and pathogenicity. In contrast, S2 sequences are more conserved and contain two heptad repeat motifs that suggest a coiled-coil structure (Lai and Holmes, 2001).",

FCoVs can be distinguished into two serotypes, I and II, on the basis of a virus neutralization assay in vitro using both type-specific feline sera and monoclonal antibodies directed against the S protein (Herrewegh et al., 1998). In the field, FCoVs type I are predominant and FCoVs type II are detected only sporadically. Differences in the S gene of FCoVs type I and that of FCoVs type II may also account for the different properties observed in vitro, as indeed FCoVs type I grow poorly in tissue culture cells (Pedersen et al., 1984) while type II strains grow well.",

A genetic drift to FCoV type II was also observed in the sequence of CCoVs detected in the faeces of two pups infected naturally during the late stages of long-term viral shedding. It was thus hypothesized that (i) the dogs might have been infected by a mixed population of genetically different CCoVs, or (ii) the viruses detected in both the pups were the result of mutation/recombination events (Pratelli et al., 2002b).",

The presence of FCoV-like CCoVs in the same samples was detected by means of a differential PCR assay, using primers (CCoV1a\u2013CCoV2) able to recognise nucleotide substitutions conserved in the M gene across all the FCoV-like CCoVs (Pratelli et al., 2002a).

Taking into account the sequence drift to FCoVs observed in the M gene, we designed a pair of primers, UCD1F\u2013UCD1R, amplifying a 502 bp fragment at the very 3\u2032 end of the sequence of the S gene of FCoVs type I (strains UCD1, KU-2 and Black), which encodes for the highly conserved C-terminus of the spike protein.

This strategy is based on the identification of blocks of homology in the amino acid sequences of distantly related organisms. Hybrid oligonucleotides, with a short 3\u2032 degenerate core region and a longer 5\u2032 consensus clamp region, are selected by retro-translation on the blocks individuated. CODEHOP sense primers with low degeneracy index were selected to amplify overlapping fragments of ORF2. One-step reverse transcription and PCR amplification were carried out using SuperScript\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates (Life Technologies, Invitrogen. Milan, Italy). To select against any CCoV-like virus during PCR amplification, reverse primers specific for the S gene of FCoV-like CCoV Elmo/02 were used in combination with the forward degenerate primers. Reference CCoV strains, S378, K378, 45/93 (Buonavoglia et al., 1994), USDA, 1/71 and SE, were used as controls in the PCR reactions, to verify that no CCoV was amplified by the primers. The amplicons were cloned into pCR\u00ae2.1-TOPO\u00ae vectors (TOPO TA Cloning\n\u00ae\n, Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and the recombinant clones individuated by blue/white screening. Plasmid DNA was extracted and subjected to sequence analysis (Genome Express: Labo Grenoble, France). Following this strategy, the fragments of the FCoV-like virus Elmo/02 were inserted into the clones. A consensus of the sequences obtained was determined and the overlapping fragments were manually edited. Alignments and sequence analysis were performed using the bioedit software package (Hall, 1999). The guidelines of the strategy used to determine the sequence of the S gene of the FCoV-like CCoV are schematised in Fig. 1\n. The position and sequence of the degenerate primers are reported in Table 1. The nucleotide sequence of Elmo/02 will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession no. AY170345. The amino acid sequence of the FCoV-like CCoV Elmo/02 was inferred and aligned with a selection of coronaviruses of the group I. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 2.1 (Kumar et al. 2001) and PAUP version 4.0b (Swofford, 1998). A parsimony tree was elaborated using a heuristic algorithm and supplying statistical support by bootstrapping over 100 replicates.",

So far, little evidence has been provided for genetic drifts or shifts affecting CCoV. Wesley (1999) has described a canine strain displaying a higher sequence identity to TGEV in the N-terminus of the S protein, explained as a possible recombination between CCoV and TGEV, and related to improved growth in swine testicular cells. The findings in the present study clearly indicate that a novel CCoV type, highly divergent from the reference CCoV strains, and more closely related to FCoVs type I, circulates among dogs. Indeed, by means of RT-PCR, Elmo/02-like strains were successfully detected in all the samples tested. All the samples had been characterised as \u2018atypical\u2019 CCoVs when screened with a RT-PCR targeted to the M gene and able to distinguish between the two genetic lineages previously identified (Pratelli et al., 2002a). Extensive sequence analysis of multiple regions in the ORF1a and 1b, as well in the M-encoding gene, has confirmed the existence of a distinct genetic lineage of CCoV, evolutionarily localised between CCoV and FCoV. Many amino acid residues observed in the M protein of FCoV-like CCoVs are the same as in FCoVs and presumably represent a retention of the sequence of an ancestral virus (Pratelli et al., 2003). Re-considering these data in the light of the findings of the present study and considering the analogies with closely related viruses, we have concluded that the extent of genetic variation observed within the CCoVs is limited in the ORF1a and slightly greater in the ORF1b and ORF5, though it still accounts for a clear pattern of segregation into a distinct genetic lineage. The two genotypes of CCoV diverge dramatically in the ORF2, where there is more than 38.4% nucleotide and about 45.5% amino acid variation from reference CCoVs. Analysis of the S gene of the Elmo/02-like CCoVs revealed a little degree of variation (4\u20138%), which may be explained by their different geographical origin. The majority of the sequence changes observed are conservative, demonstrating that there is some heterogeneity in the ORF2 of Elmo/02-like CCoVs. In conclusion, the findings suggest that the two canine genotypes underwent a linear evolution rather than a sudden shift originating from a recombinant event analogous to those leading to the appearance of FCoVs type II. Finally, recombination with an ancestral coronavirus from which FCoVs type I and Elmo/02-like CCoVs directly evolved may not be excluded.",

Moreover, the presence of the stretch of basic residues RRARR is indicative of a potential cleavage of the protein (Wesseling et al., 1994). A similar basic motive is present, approximately in the same position, in all the coronaviruses identified to date of both group II and III, but it is absent in all the coronaviruses of group I.
