In general, we observed an increase in IgG positivity in second samples (from 1 to 4 positive cases ) and this is in agreement with the common view describing IgM as responsabile of early and IgG late anticorpal reaction (10) . In our previous reports (13) (14) , analyzing serological test with respect to RT-PCR certified virus-infection, we confirmed the early appearance of IgM. Recent data from Guo (10) stressed the variability of Ig kinetics in sARS-COV2 patients showing that IgG specific can be found since early beginning of symptoms and, conversely, that IgM can persist at high level even up to 25 days after symptoms appearance.",
