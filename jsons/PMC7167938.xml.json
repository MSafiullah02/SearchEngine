An association between peak bronchiolitis, incidence, and clinical severity was found. It could be linked to our finding of higher incidence of RSV in peak months with respect to the non\u2010peak months. Having both parents with asthma and the number of eosinophils were significantly lower during peak months. These facts may justify the different characteristics of this population hospitalized in a period with lower viruses detection and less severe viral infections. On the other hand, analyzing risk factors for respiratory diseases, infants exposed to maternal smoke during pregnancy were hospitalized more during peak months; this could be linked to modification of respiratory mucosa and subsequent predisposition to viral infection, in particular from RSV in at risk infants. Noakes et al. studied that smoke increases early susceptibility to infection and, then, the subsequent IgA responses.19, 20, 21, 22, 23\n",
