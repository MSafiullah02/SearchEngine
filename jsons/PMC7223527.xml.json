After induction of general anesthesia (which initially decreases functional residual capacity), turning the patient into lateral decubitus position causes compression of dependent hemidiaphragm by abdominal organs and basal parts of the dependent lung may become atelectatic. Because all of the above, non-dependent lung\u2019s compliance curve shifts to a more favorable part compared to dependent lung which may precipitate shunting (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\dot{V}/\\dot{Q}$$\\end{document}V\u02d9/Q\u02d9 mismatch), drop in PaO2/FiO2 (Horowitz quotient) and an increase in alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient (A-a gradient).

Therefore, more than 40 years ago \u201coptimal\u201d PEEP level was proposed as a compromise between adequate oxygenation and hemodynamic stability [6]. Many methods are in use to determine the desired PEEP levels, be it PEEP/FiO2 tables proposed by the ARDS network [7], determination of optimal compliance of the respiratory system using pressure\u2013volume curves, estimating the transpulmonary pressure by measuring pressure in the airways and esophagus (as a surrogate of pleural pressure), lung ultrasonography [8], computerized tomography and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) [4, 5].",

It works on the principle of electrode belt placed around chest through which weak alternating current is applied, impedance differences between each electrode pair are calculated and then a tomogram is generated which shows spatial distribution of ventilation. In various studies, EIT has been validated as an efficient and safe method of PEEP optimization in animals and humans, especially in patients with ARDS [9\u201311], for laparoscopic procedures [12\u201314] and for one lung ventilation [15]. Certain EIT derived indices such as center of ventilation [16] and GI index [10, 17] are being used in clinical practice to further assess distribution of ventilation and quantify the image.",

Difference between continuous variables were, dependent on normality, tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. Differences in repeated measurements between groups were tested using repeated measurement analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with between and within group interactions and post hoc Bonferroni correction. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1) was used to assess the correlation between continuous variables. Sample size calculation was conducted using G*Power 3.1 [20]. Statistical analysis was performed using JASP v0.9.1 [21], jamovi v0.9.5 [22] and PAST v3.20 [23]. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

In supine patients, pressure of abdominal organs on the diaphragm and thorax is generally equally distributed between left and right lung, and while there are conflicting opinions of using respiratory system compliance as a guiding parameter in setting the \u201coptimal\u201d PEEP level [25], Cordeiro et al. have shown that there is a strong correlation between respiratory system compliance and oxygenation levels (r = 0.8, p < 0.001) in mechanically ventilated cardiac surgical patients (which are positioned in supine position after surgery) [26]. However, in patients that are ventilated in lateral position (i.e. patients that were subjects in this study), there is a significant gradient in regional compliance which is present in both ventral-dorsal and left\u2013right axis. Because of that, global compliance does not accurately represent all lung regions, and results of this study show that compliance doesn\u2019t correlate with regional distribution of ventilation and parameters of alveolar gas exchange. With EIT, compliance can be measured for each pixel (and subsequently for lung regions) by dividing tidal impedance variation with driving pressure, as was demonstrated by Costa et al. [27].",

Although both the nondependent/dependent TV ratio and hCoV attempt to quantify distribution of ventilation along the latero-lateral axis, method of calculation is different. While hCoV is calculated from individual pixel impedance variation in each row and must be made offline after data export, nondependent/dependent TV ratio is calculated from TV percentages divided across ROI and is easily calculated by the bedside.

            "text": "Our findings suggest that, when compared to PEEP levels of 0 or 5 mbar, a PEEP level of 10 mbar leads to improved gas exchange in the lungs and more symmetrical ventilation distribution between left and right lung without compromising hemodynamic stability. Due to inhomogeneous lung mechanics and poor correlation of respiratory system compliance with parameters of alveolar gas exchange EIT could be a useful method for PEEP titration in these patients. Further studies are needed to assess changes of distribution of ventilation in patients with lung pathology who are ventilated in lateral position.",
