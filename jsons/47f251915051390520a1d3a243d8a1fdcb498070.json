In addition to routine testing of laboratory parameters, some potential indicators for severe cases should also be monitored and regularly followed up for testing, including lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, IL-6, peripheral blood lymphocyte count and CD4 + T lymphocytes, etc. 1,2 For patients with high risk of severe illness, anticoagulation treatment with heparin is recommended. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be maintained at 1 to 2 doses per day until the level of D-dimer returns to normal.

The first point is \"high risk of disease progression\". The mechanism of glucocorticoids is to suppress excessive immune responses. In most mild patients, the immune response against the virus is beneficial. The use of glucocorticoids may reduce the clearance of the virus; while for severe or critically ill patients who have already produced a \"cytokine storm\", the use of glucocorticoids is too late to block this excessive inflammatory response. Therefore, glucocorticoids should be used in the early stage of excessive inflammatory reactions to achieve the best results. According to our experience, clinical manifestations of this period are characterized by rapid radiography progression with or without deterioration of oxygenation levels. That is to say, for patients with mild disease, if there is obvious progression of lung lesions within 48 h, the application of glucocorticoids can be considered to prevent the serious development of these patients.",
