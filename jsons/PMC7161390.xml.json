Two of his stated reasons for this position are (1) high-rise residential buildings are typically of masonry construction and lack the empty spaces between the interior of their exterior walls and the outer edges of their floors (that typify the curtain walls of steel-framed [core construction] buildings) and (2) for privacy and usage reasons, residential buildings are typically compartmentalized with walls and partitions that have adequate fire resistance to withstand the fire until the arrival of the fire department; as a result individual fires are considerably smaller in area.20\n",

            "text": "\nIn the study mentioned in the previous section, \u201cThreats,\u201d Hall commented on fire protection in high-rise buildings by stating,In several instances, the value of these fire protection features [i.e., automatic extinguishing systems (primarily sprinklers), fire detection equipment, and fire-resistive construction] may be seen clearly in a statistical analysis of 1994\u20131998 loss per fire averages, with and without the protection. For high-rise buildings, automatic extinguishing systems are associated with a reduction of at least 88% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires for each of the three property classes (excluding office buildings, which had no deaths recorded in NFIRS [National Fire Incident Reporting System] in high-rise buildings) and at least 44% in the average dollar loss per fire for each of the four property classes. Fire detection equipment is associated with a reduction of 55% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires in apartment buildings. Fire-resistive construction is associated with a reduction of 30% in average dollar loss per fire in apartment buildings. This probably is produced not directly by the construction but indirectly by the compartmentation features that tend to be used with fire-resistive construction, features that keep more fires smaller and so keep property losses lower. (Note, though, that compartmentation practices probably vary more by type of occupancy than by type of construction.) Because high-rise buildings often use all three systems, it is very difficult to try to separate their effects on loss rates, and many rates are very sensitive to deaths or large dollar loss in individual incidents.Automatic extinguishing systems and fire detection equipment and the compartmentation features associated with fire-resistive construction all contribute to fire protection by helping to keep fires small, with extinguishing and construction doing so directly and detection doing so by providing early warning that can lead to earlier manual suppression\u2026Finally, the effectiveness of these fire protection systems and features and their widespread use in high-rise buildings mean that when people are killed in high-rise residential fires, they are much more likely to have been close to the fire, where it is more likely that fatal injury could occur before [the] fire could be stopped or blocked by these systems and features.24\n",

            "text": "There are many ways to educate building residents about the building's security program. All building residents and their visitors should be made aware of the program and how various policies and procedures affect them. If people are aware of the logic behind security regulations, they usually are more willing to comply with them. This communication can be achieved in the following ways:\u2022Explain the regulations on an informal, as-needed basis. For example, building security staff may explain to a visitor the purpose of calling a resident before he or she can be admitted.\u2022Use posted signs; written policies and procedures published in the Resident Manual\u2666\nand on the building's website; pamphlets, leaflets, flyers, newsletters, e-mails, and video training materials supplied by building management to the resident. Sometimes, information is displayed on in-car elevator video screens. Such elevator bulletins may, for example, provide information that reminds occupants that in the event the elevator stops running, they should immediately use the elevator emergency communication device to request assistance; or the bulletin may be used to post other appropriate emergency notifications. Appendix 9\u20131 on the CD-ROM provided with this book is a Sample Resident Security and Safety Awareness Checklist that could be revised and sent to residents at appropriate times during the year.\u2022Conduct security and safety orientation lectures, classes, briefings, workshops, and seminars. These events can be an effective medium, not only for communicating to residents what is required of them in the building security program but also as an opportunity to educate employees about basic security and safety measures they can adopt at home. (Such measures could include being aware of their surroundings, elevator safety,\u2666\u2666\nsecuring vehicle doors and windows, not leaving valuable items in view in parked vehicles, securing their residences and personal property, and reporting any problems in common areas.) The length of such events will vary, but 45 minutes to an hour is probably the maximum that residents will permit. As with all effective teaching, the use of audio-visual aids\u2014films, videotapes, DVDs, and slides\u2014can help gain the attention of participants and assist in effectively communicating the required message. The frequency of classes, meetings, conferences, seminars, and workshops will vary from building to building; they may be regularly scheduled or conducted when a specific need arises. More will be said about the training of occupants, floor wardens and building emergency staff in the next section, \u201cEmergency Planning.\u201d\n",
