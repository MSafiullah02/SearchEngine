Because of time constraints and the extensive geographic areas covered by some OPOs, testing is often limited to serologic methods that are rapid and routinely available.

Increasingly, some OPOs are utilizing rapid molecular testing, particularly in high-risk potential donors, including NAT testing for HCV, HBV and HIV.
