The United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines state that people who still have a high temperature after 7 days of self-isolation must remain at home until their temperature returns to normal. 24 The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to range from 1 to 14 days, with symptom onset typically around 5 days; these estimates will be updated as more data becomes available. 4 Patients may be infectious before showing any symptoms, and some may show no symptoms at all. A person who has been in contact with someone known to have COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days, until such time as WHO guidance is updated. 4 It is important to follow national guidelines. Communicate this information to patients as early as possible, so that patients who need to self-isolate do not travel to the unit in the first place. If they do arrive at the unit, there should be very clear information to prevent infection spread; e.g., telling patients to return home and self-isolate ( Figure 1 ). ",

Although a follicular conjunctivitis can be caused by the virus, this seems to be a relatively uncommon and a non-specific sign that presents later in the clinical course. However, a health care worker who was part of an expert task force to visit Wuhan developed conjunctivitis as the first symptom of COVID-19 despite being fully gowned with protective suit and N95 respirator. 32 Health care workers have subsequently been urged to wear eye protection when in close contact with patients; this is also reflected in recently updated guidance. 15, 33 Many cases of conjunctivitis do not actually require review and it is important that patients with possible symptoms of COVID-19 are instructed to self-isolate unless they require hospital in-patient care. If a patient does present with any conjunctivitis, it would seem sensible to wear full PPE until more is known.",

See CDC: Standard Precautions. ** Supply permitting, tight-fitting goggles may be preferable to face shields for eye protection. \u2020 Currently, there are national and international shortages of PPE, which also warrant consideration. Excessive use of PPE may deplete the supply of critical equipment required in the future for patients with COVID-19 as the epidemic expands. Use of PPE should be considered on an institutional and case-by-case basis; universal usage for all patient encounters is not appropriate. \u2021 Transmission Precautions: Second tier of basic infection control, used in addition to Standard Precautions when patients have diseases that can spread through contact, droplet or airborne routes, requiring specific precautions based on the circumstances of a case. Transmission precautions are required for cases of suspected COVID-19. See CDC: Transmission-Based Precautions.",
