            "text": "Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a wide variety of etiologic agents and presents with overlapping signs and symptoms; therefore, prediction of the causative organism based on clinical findings alone is not reliable [1]. Among the various diagnostic tests available, multiplex nucleic acid amplification assays are capable of detecting and identifying multiple respiratory pathogens and are now commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The xTAG\u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) from Luminex\u00ae was the first multiplexed molecular assay for respiratory pathogens cleared for in vitro diagnostic use and was capable of detecting 12\u201319 common respiratory viruses and subtypes, depending on the geographical region [2]. xTAG RVP incorporated multiplex Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex Target Specific Primer Extension (TSPE) with Luminex\u2019s xTAG technology, a proprietary universal sequence tag sorting system that allows easy development and optimization of nucleic acid assays on xMAP\u00ae microspheres. In this assay system, samples are spiked with an internal control and subjected to nucleic acid extraction. Nucleic acid extracts are subjected to multiplex RT-PCR and treated with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase and Exonuclease I (EXO) to inactivate remaining nucleotides and degrade leftover primers. Multiplex TSPE is then used to detect and label any viral nucleic acids that were amplified by PCR, incorporating the unique sequence tag during extension. At the time of its introduction in 2007, it was a major innovation that revolutionized the approach to diagnosis of respiratory infections. While much faster than traditional culture and immunological tests, the entire xTAG RVP procedure still takes approximately 6\u20138 h to complete. In addition, as an open platform system, there is a potential risk for cross-contamination after specimen extraction and PCR amplification steps [3].",

            "text": "Subsequently, Luminex developed the xTAG FAST assay chemistry which employed tagged primers and labeled primers together in a target-specific multiplex RT-PCR assay in order to streamline the workflow and shorten the time to result to approximately 4 h. The FAST version 1 assay incorporated the original non-magnetic xTAG microspheres whereas the version 2 assay is detected on the magnetic MagPlex-TAG microspheres. Following the nucleic acid extraction and multiplex RT-PCR reaction, an aliquot of the amplified and tagged targets are simultaneously hybridized to the xTAG or MagPlex-TAG microspheres and labeled with reporter dye for detection on either the Luminex\u2122 200 or MAGPIX\u00ae analyzer. This format eliminated the post-PCR clean-up and TSPE steps from the workflow entirely, decreased the time to result by about 2\u20134 h, and reduced the tube opening/transfer steps down to one. xTAG RVP FAST (and/or xTAG RVP FAST v2) was IVD-cleared for 7\u201317 targets, depending on the geographical region.",

            "text": "NxTAG\u00ae is the newest generation of universal tag sorting chemistry from Luminex. The NxTAG\u00ae Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) was launched in December 2015. NxTAG RPP incorporates multiplex RT-PCR with the universal tag system in the form of lyophilized reagents to provide a closed system for amplification and detection of 20\u201321 respiratory viral and bacterial targets. All of the PCR and bead hybridization components, including tagged primers, fluorescently-labeled primers, enzyme, dNTPs, buffers, and MagPlex-TAG microspheres, are combined in precise mixtures and lyophilized into small beads or Lyophilized Bead Reagents (LBRs). LBRs are pre-plated into individual wells of a 96-well plate that allows scalable batch testing for 1 to 96 reactions. Extracted total nucleic acid is added to pre-plated LBRs sealed in individual reaction wells by piercing the pipette tip through a foil seal. The reaction is mixed by pipette to resuspend the reaction components and resealed with a fresh foil seal. The reaction is then amplified via RT-PCR and the reaction product undergoes near simultaneous bead hybridization within the single sealed reaction well. No open procedures are needed after nucleic acid extraction and amplification, thereby virtually eliminating the risk for carryover contamination [4]. The hybridized, tagged beads are then sorted and read on the MAGPIX\u00ae instrument, and the signals are analyzed using the NxTAG RPP Assay File for SYNCT\u2122 Software, providing a qualitative call for each of the targets and internal control within each reaction well.",

Other causes for invalid results included low bead count (0.5%), internal control failure (0.3%), and inconclusive results due to abnormal signals (0.1%). The frequency of invalid results was evenly distributed among the clinical sites. All available residual specimens were re-run with NxTAG RPP and generated valid results upon re-test.

None of the pathogens included in this study were found to cross-react, with the exception of three strains of non-pandemic influenza A H1 (A/Brisbane/59/07, A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and A/Singapore/63/04) (data not shown). These strains cross-reacted with CoV 229E when the titer of the influenza A H1 was above 1 \u00d7 104 TCID50/mL. Based on both laboratory testing and in silico prediction, high titers of these three non-pandemic influenza A H1 strains may result in a false positive call for CoV 229E. Based on in silico analysis, there is also a potential that the presence of CoV 229E may cause a false positive influenza H1 call and the presence of PIV-2 may cause a false positive influenza H3 call. Nevertheless no false positive calls were observed with these targets in either the prospective or pre-selected sample sets in the clinical study.",

This technology retains the advantages of Luminex\u2019s xTAG universal array technology while providing several enhancements over its predecessors. As with xTAG technology, NxTAG allows for scalable testing which makes it amenable to both low- and high-throughput applications, providing flexibility for routine daily testing of low specimen volumes but also the ability to handle unpredicted increases in sample volume that may occur. Key advancements with NxTAG technology include: a significantly reduced hands-on-time (\u223c7 min for 8 samples), reduced overall turnaround time (approximately 5 h per batch, including extraction), and most notably, the convenience of all RT-PCR and bead hybridization reagents lyophilized and pre-plated into individual wells. This allows all steps of the assay process (post-extraction) to be carried out in a single, closed tube to both maximize the ease-of-use and minimize the risk of cross-contamination. In addition, to accommodate large sample volumes, it would be possible for the user to automate or semi-automate the post-extraction steps through use of standard automated 96-well plate handlers and pipetting robots. Manual set-up, just using a 96-well plate format for the extracted samples and a multi-channel pipettor, allows an entire 96-well NxTAG plate to be set up in less than 10 min.

These two targets exhibited 100% and 97.6% positive agreement in the pre-selected sample set, respectively, where data were generated from 33 and 42 pre-selected positive specimens.

While many of the causative organisms are treated similarly, the ability to accurately detect the organisms present and the most likely pathogen is very important when confronted with several organisms in a sample which are of varying risk to the patient. Furthermore, ability to detect co-infections is most important for organisms that can be treated, such as influenza, RSV, adenovirus, or M. pneumoniae where infection control measures are applied and if the patient population is predominantly immunocompromised.

Based on NxTAG chemistry, it provides several advantages over the previous xTAG universal array chemistry. All reaction components are provided lyophilized and pre-plated into individual, sealed reaction wells. Once the extracted nucleic acid sample is added and the well is resealed, there is no further hands-on manipulation. This workflow both maximizes ease-of-use and minimizes risk of cross-contamination. As described in this protocol, after set-up, the reactions are processed on a thermal cycler and then read in the MAGPIX analyzer. The prospective multi-center study and several published studies described herein demonstrate the high accuracy of NxTAG RPP as compared to its xTAG predecessors and other multiplex assays, combined with a simplified workflow, low hands-on-time and scalable throughput that can meet the needs of a variety of laboratory settings.",
