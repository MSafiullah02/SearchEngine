The most notable are inhibition of quorum sensing (through MTAN) and anticancer activity (through MTAP and PNP).6, 7, 4 Other noteworthy effects include antiparasitic and antibacterial activity.8, 9, 10 Immucillin A (1), also shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Fig. 1\n). It is an RNA polymerase inhibitor and functions as a non-obligate chain terminator. It is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of Ebola virus infection under the name galidesivir\u00ae.11, 12, 13\n",

            "text": "The synthesis of azanucleosides is not trivial. The core iminosugar often requires a long multi-step synthesis, and attachment of the nucleobase poses a second challenge, due to the unstable hemi-aminal linkage that would hydrolyze spontaneously upon contact with water. Several strategies have been investigated to overcome this liability. Apart from synthesizing C-nucleosides, where most of the research has been focusing on, enhanced stability can also be obtained by substituting the nitrogen. Chiacchio et al., for example, reported an N-Boc-protected 3\u2019-deoxyazaribonucleoside that displays highly potent anti-HCV activity in a replicon assay.14 A third strategy is the synthesis of N-homoazanucleosides, in which a methylene linker is inserted between the carbohydrate mimic and the base. Although this formal insertion of a CH2 unit in the glycosidic bond lengthens the separation between the base and the pyrrolidine ring relative to that in the natural substrate, this bond is likewise elongated in transition states. 1\u2019-homoaza-adenosine 3 is an inhibitor of protozoan nucleoside hydrolases, although less potent than the corresponding C-nucleoside.15, 16 Furthermore, several second-generation Immucillins, for example the femtomolar MTAP/MTAN inhibitor 2, also possess an extra methylene linker between the pyrrolidine and the surrogate nucleobase.17, 18, 19 In addition, homonucleosides are resistant towards nucleases, may still be phosphorylated by cellular enzymes and are able to pair with natural nucleosides through Watson-Crick interactions.20 1\u2032-Homonucleosides were recently reviewed by Wr\u00f3blewski et al.21\n",

This transposition of the nucleobase affords analogues with the same number of bonds between the nucleobase and carbons 2\u2032, 3\u2032 and 4\u2032 of the pyrrolidine ring as in the natural nucleosides and therefore might more closely mimic the spatial arrangements of natural nucleosides.
