It has been suggested that based on seasonal variation and the clinical syndrome seen, one can predict what type of virus is implicated.1, 2 Limited data exist, with regards to the clinical importance of mixed respiratory viral infections during the winter season. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are well known to circulate in winter.1, 3 The extent of overlap, the possibility of dual infections and associations of mixed respiratory viral infections with clinical and epidemiological data needs further elucidation. Point of Care testing and newer available molecular techniques have improved our ability to detect diverse viruses causing respiratory infections.4 In a recent study evaluating two different multiplex kits 14.2% of samples tested, harbored viral co\u2010infections.4 Limited studies have evaluated the presence of mixed viral infections at the clinical setting for adult populations. Significant rates of mixed infections have been reported in several studies mainly involving pediatric populations5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 while very little data exist regarding adult patients.15, 16, 17, 18 The clinical significance of mixed viral infections is a matter of debate with some data supporting a role for increased illness severity and adverse outcomes including hospitalizations5, 15 and some not.9, 10, 16 Further, most of the studies are biased towards studying hospitalized subjects9, 10, 19, 20 and very little data exist regarding outpatients.16, 17, 18\n",

Other studies have not confirmed this association similarly to our findings.9, 10, 16 Of interest, in our study single infections were associated with higher rates of hospitalization. This could be attributed to a systemic bias of: a) mixed infections being more common in younger children that usually run a milder clinical disease course; b) selection bias regarding the presentation to the Emergency Room of a tertiary care Hospital of more severe cases of respiratory infection that most often had single rather than mixed infection, and; c) the possibility that the additional virus detected was accidentally discovered when it was actually having a colonizing role. Furthermore, in the last two seasons of the study we had very few cases of RSV or mixed infections. Whether the coexistence of RSV and influenza meant: a) establishment of RSV prior to influenza infection or vice\u2010versa; b) the presence of one virus as a colonizer/pathogen that facilitated the establishment of the other or; c) both acted as co\u2010pathogens at the same time, is a matter, future studies should try to elucidate.",

            "text": "Our study is limited by the fact that it examined population from a single center. Despite the risk of sampling bias, for example, not all patients examined, lack of a significant number of pediatric patients, the results of our samples closely correlate to national data obtained by a Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention coordinated sentinel network that operates in more than 200 sites across the country and is much more representative of the general population. Data from this network depict that seasonal influenza starts around the end of each year (weeks 51\u201052) and lasts up until around week 16\u201018 of the next year each season (Table 3, data available at http://www.keelpno.gr). Further, we could not adjust for any climatic effects in our viral detections. It has been reported that seasonality patterns for respiratory viruses circulation differ according to climatic conditions in different geographical areas,33, 34, 35 although some studies have failed to show this.36, 37 Another limitation is that we could not exclude the possibility of RSV community outbreaks during the first 2 years of the study that could have forced more RSV infected patients to seek medical assistance. Variability of virus detection per collected samples per week of study during the 2010\u201011 season (the highest RSV rates were noted then) suggest such a possibility for the last weeks of the study, when only RSV was detected. In addition, the limited data on other viruses besides the influenza virus and RSV is indicative of the dominance of these viruses during the winter season. Larger studies performed throughout the year, are necessary to clarify clinic\u2010epidemiological associations for other viruses; for example, rhinoviruses (usually circulating in other seasons) or hMPV and bocavirus (both were more common in children in this study). Finally, we could not exclude the possibility of viral presence in patients with low viral loads in the upper airways as a reason for not detecting a virus in most of our carefully selected patients. It is well known that lower respiratory secretions have higher yield in viral detection in respiratory infections. Similarly, nasopharyngeal samples or pooled nasopharygeal and oropharyngeal samples have been reported as more appropriate for analyzing respiratory infections.38, 39 It is well known that nasopharyngeal sampling is more sensitive in detecting respiratory viruses. The detection of viruses by molecular technique in an oropharyngeal sample collected through a standardized technique has facilitated vastly in the performance of our study in a busy Emergency Room. In a subsample of our study concerning almost one third of our patients, the method described herein correlated well with nasopharyngeal swabbing results (manuscript under preparation). Nevertheless, it is possible, that our analysis was biased towards cases with higher viral loads that gave positive results more frequently than cases with lower loads. In a similar manner, we could not account for bacterial coinfections in our subjects as most of the patients unless seriously ill were not examined with specific testing for the presence of bacterial co\u2010infection. It is has been recently reported that viral\u2010 bacterial coinfections are associated with a more complicated clinical course and adversely affect the prognosis of severe community\u2014acquired pneumonia.40 Nevertheless as shown in previous studies most of the acute respiratory infections in the general population are of viral origin.41\n",

Further, as an epidemiological study it does not attempt to explain a hypothesis; rather it assists in generating hypotheses regarding the role of mixed viral infections in the adult population and points out the lack of data in this significant research area. Further work is necessary to elucidate the pathogenic role of mixed infections due to respiratory viruses and their local and systemic effects.",
