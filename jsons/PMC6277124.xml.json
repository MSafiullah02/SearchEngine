            "text": "Since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, host cellular RNA control pathways must be tolerated or circumvented for successful virus amplification. One such pathway is nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which normally removes aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) to prevent detrimental effects caused by the expression of truncated proteins. The mechanism of NMD has been extensively studied for PTC-containing mRNAs with exon-junction complexes (EJCs) deposited during splicing downstream of the PTC (see [1] for a review). The EJC is associated with NMD factors and is removed by the ribosome-associated PYM protein during normal translation, but remains unaltered in PTC-containing mRNAs, which leads to NMD [2]. Key NMD factors that are conserved across nearly all eukaryotes [3] include the Up-frameshift group of proteins (UPF1-3), with UPF1 as the master regulator [4]. UPF1 contains ATPase and RNA helicase domains necessary for NMD and is regulated by a complex involving UPF2 and UPF3 [5, 6]. Activated UPF1 recruits nucleases to eliminate NMD-targeted transcripts, with key differences existing between mammalian and plant systems [7]. For example, both the SMG6 endo- and SMG7-guided exonucleolytic pathways are utilized in mammalian cells [8, 9], whereas only SMG7-coordinated exonucleolytic cleavage is used in plants due to the absence of SMG6 homologs [10, 11].",

            "text": "In addition to EJC-dependent NMD caused by 3\u2019 UTR introns and upstream open reading frames (uORFs), EJC-independent NMD has been described for mRNAs containing long 3\u2019 UTRs or uORFs [12]. For polyadenylated mRNAs with short 3\u2019 UTRs, translation termination includes an interaction between eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) and cytoplasmic poly-A binding protein (PABPC1), which restricts UPF1 binding. Long 3\u2019 UTRs limit eRF3-PABPC1 interactions, allowing elevated levels of UPF1 to associate with the termination complex and increasing the likelihood of UPF1 initiating the NMD pathway [13\u201318]. Multiple genome-wide searches, however, have identified a large number of genes with exceptionally long 3\u2019 UTRs that are resistant to NMD [19\u201322], but few have defined mechanisms for NMD-evasion. Human polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) has been identified as an NMD-antagonist by binding polypyrimidine hexamers in the vicinity of NMD-targeted termination codons, which prevents NMD by displacing UPF1 [23]. In yeast, the RNA binding protein Pub1 protects the GCN4 and YAP1 mRNAs from NMD by direct binding to AU-rich elements downstream of their respective uORFs [24].",

            "text": "Most RNA viruses have multicistronic genomes to conserve limited encapsidation space. As a result, many viral genomic (g)RNAs, especially those associated with 3\u2019-co-terminal subgenomic (sg)RNAs, are templates for translation of only the 5\u2019 proximal ORF leaving a long 3\u2019 UTR (e.g., >3000 nt). Since this translation strategy makes these viruses optimal targets for NMD, most have likely evolved strategies to evade degradation [25, 26]. However, only three such strategies have been elucidated. For example, similar to some resistant mRNAs, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) contains a polypyrimidine-rich cis-acting sequence immediately downstream of the gag termination codon that provides protection of an otherwise optimal target (>6700-nt 3\u2019 UTR) by recruiting PTBP1 [23, 27, 28]. In addition, the readthrough elements from Moloney murine leukemia virus and Colorado tick fever virus inhibit NMD by allowing ribosomes to continue translation past the termination codon [29, 30]. Finally, global-inhibition of NMD has been described for Human T-lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The HTLV-1 Tax and Rex proteins inhibit NMD through binding to UPF1 [31, 32] while the HCV core protein inhibits NMD by disrupting interactions between NMD-associated proteins WIBG, Y14, and Magoh [33]. Elucidating additional NMD-evasion strategies employed by viruses, especially strategies that could be more widespread, is not only important for understanding virus fitness but also for providing insights into additional mechanisms used by NMD-resistant cellular mRNAs.",

            "text": "Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) has a positive-sense, single-stranded gRNA (4053 nt) and two sgRNAs that together code for 5 proteins (Fig 1A). When translation of the gRNA terminates at the end of the 5\u2019 p28 ORF, the 3\u2019 UTR is >3200 nt in length. Infrequently, ribosomes read through the p28 stop codon to translate the p88 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). p8 and p9 are translated from sgRNA1 by leaky scanning [34] and are important for virus cell-to-cell movement. The p38 CP, which is predominantly expressed from sgRNA2, requires synthesis throughout the infection cycle as CP serves as both the virus\u2019s RNA silencing suppressor [35] and as the sole protein required for capsid formation (180 copies/virion). The 3\u2019 UTR of sgRNA2 (254 nt) is considered short compared to some viruses in the Tombusviridae, but average compared to 3\u2019 UTRs of host mRNAs (average 3\u2019 UTR length in Arabidopsis is 236 nt; see S1 Fig). The 3\u2019 UTRs of viruses in the Tombusviridae have significantly higher GC% content compared to host mRNAs (S1 Fig), and elevated GC% content has been associated with increased UPF1 association and NMD [36]. Together, the multicistronic organization and high-GC% content of the TCV 3\u2019 UTR should predispose TCV gRNA and sgRNAs to NMD. In support of this, an earlier study demonstrated that TCV accumulation was strongly reduced by overexpression of UPF1 compared with levels when NMD was suppressed by addition of U1D, a dominant negative version of UPF1 that is a potent inhibitor of NMD [37, 12]. The authors thus concluded that NMD is a general virus restriction pathway in plants [37]. However, TCV replicates to ribosomal RNA levels in both cell culture and in planta, suggesting that TCV must be evading NMD and thus the endogenous (i.e., UPF1-unsupplemented) NMD pathway is probably insufficient to substantially limit TCV accumulation.",

Resistance was maintained when 19 pyrimidines were converted to purines but abolished when a downstream 2-base mutation generated a stable hairpin in the region. An RNA structure that mediates low level ribosome readthrough just past the 5\u2019 proximal ORF also protected NMD-sensitive transcripts.

PEMV-2 has an unusually long 3\u2019 UTR (704 nt) and generates a sgRNA with overlapping ORFs that encode proteins p27 and p26 (Fig 1B). p27 and p26 are required for short and long-distance movement of the virus, respectively, and p26 is additionally required for virus accumulation in protoplasts [38]. TCV and PEMV-2 gRNA expression constructs with 3\u2019 end ribozymes (Rz) were introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration either alone (-), or co-expressed with either UPF1 or the NMD-inhibitor U1D, and RNA levels were determined by northern blotting 72 hours post-infiltration (hpi). As previously reported using the same assay [37], TCV was sensitive to UPF1 overexpression and levels were strongly enhanced when NMD was inhibited by the presence of U1D (Fig 1A). However, when compared with UPF1-unsupplemented levels (-), TCV accumulation was not enhanced by U1D, suggesting that TCV evades NMD during infection. PEMV-2 gRNA levels were also markedly increased by co-expression with U1D compared with overexpression of UPF1 (Fig 1B). Compared with UPF1-unsupplemented levels, PEMV-2 gRNA levels increased by 42% in the presence of U1D and sgRNA levels were substantially higher. These results suggest that PEMV-2 is more sensitive to NMD compared with TCV.",

In contrast, sgRNA1 was sensitive to NMD under these conditions, with levels increasing by nearly 4-fold in the presence of U1D compared to UPF1 (Fig 1C). Surprisingly, sgRNA1 levels were not detectably different during TCV infection when U1D was overexpressed (Fig 1A). A possible explanation is that sgRNA1 produced by virus replication in the cytosol and lacking a 5\u2019 cap is NMD-resistant, whereas sgRNA1 produced via agroinfiltration in the nucleus bearing a 5\u2019 cap is NMD-sensitive.",

Since a cis-acting RNA element just downstream of an internal stop codon in RSV confers resistance to NMD [28], we evaluated whether sequences immediately downstream of each TCV stop codon could provide similar protection. Agroinfiltration was used to deliver transiently expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs in the absence or presence of co-infiltrated U1D [12]. If added sequences cause normally susceptible transcripts to be protected from NMD, then GFP levels should not differ significantly in the presence or absence of U1D. If transcripts remain sensitive to NMD, then suppression of NMD by U1D would allow those transcripts to accumulate to higher levels. To prevent host RNA silencing from affecting results and to provide for an internal control, the p14 RNA silencing suppressor from Pothos latent virus was co-infiltrated in all experiments [40].",

In contrast, a GFP reporter construct with a long, 747 nt 3\u2019 UTR derived from the coding region of the bean phytohemagglutinin gene (GFP-L) was NMD-sensitive as addition of U1D increased transcript levels by 3.2-fold (Fig 2B). When 250-nt regions following the stop codons of p28, p88, p8, p9, and CP ORFs were placed just downstream of the GFP stop codon in GFP-L (generating p28-L, p88-L, p8-L, p9-L, and 3\u2019UTR-L, respectively; Fig 2A), only 3\u2019UTR-L transcripts were protected against NMD (Fig 2B). In contrast, GFP mRNA levels for the remaining constructs increased 2.4- to 5.3-fold when NMD was inhibited by U1D, similar to the increase for GFP-L (3.2-fold). This suggests that the sequence just downstream of the CP ORF protects one or more TCV transcripts from NMD during infection.",

This infrequent recoding event ensures that only a limited amount of RdRp is synthesized, which is important for viral fitness [42, 43]. Since earlier reports revealed that ribosomal readthrough of NMD-sensitive stop codons protects transcripts from NMD (likely through displacement of UPF1 by the translocating ribosome [29, 30, 44]), we noted that construct p28-L, which contains the TCV recoding structural element (RSE) that mediates readthrough [45], did not provide NMD-resistance. The TCV RSE is an extended pseudoknotted hairpin that connects with the Pr hairpin at the gRNA\u2019s 3\u2019 terminus via a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction. The TCV RSE and similar structures found in the vast majority of viruses in the Tombusviridae are located just downstream of the 5\u2019 proximal ORF UAG termination codon, incorporating the guanylate as one member of the terminal base-pair of the structure [41]. In contrast, the RSE in p28-L was located 7-nt downstream from the GFP termination codon, which may have prevented sufficient ribosome readthrough. In addition, there was no long-distance interaction with a 3\u2019 proximal hairpin that is critical for efficient readthrough [45]. Furthermore, termination codons in the out-of-frame 3\u2019 UTR \u201cL\u201d sequence downstream of the RSE-containing segment would have caused early termination, likely preventing disassociation of UPF1 by translocating ribosomes.",

The RSE of PEMV-2 promotes recoding through -1 ribosomal frameshifting, which also requires a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction with a 3\u2019 terminal hairpin that was included in RSEPEMVGFP-L [46]. Unlike the TCV RSE, RSEPEMVGFP-L transcripts generated sufficient frameshift product in agroinfiltrated leaves to be detected by western blotting (Fig 3C). As with the TCV RSE, RSEPEMVGFP-L transcripts, but not STOP-RSEPEMVGFP-L transcripts, were protected against NMD (Fig 3B, bottom). Although inefficient at ribosome recoding, we conclude that TCV and PEMV-2 recoding elements are capable of protecting an NMD-sensitive transcript and this mechanism could contribute to protecting their respective gRNAs from NMD in natural infections.",

When the complete 3\u2019 UTR was positioned 578 nt downstream of the GFP stop codon (and just upstream of the 35S terminator sequence) in construct GFP-L (generating L-3\u2019UTR), transcripts were no longer protected against NMD.

However, previous in-line RNA structure probing of this region in TCV gRNA fragments showed that nearly every residue of the USR is susceptible to backbone cleavage (i.e., the residues are unpaired and flexible), indicating that the stem-loop is either not forming, or not consistently forming in the RNA fragment population [52] (Fig 6C). In an attempt to stabilize this structure, two point mutations (AA56UG) were introduced 5 nt downstream of the USR in full-length TCV-WT and in reporter construct 3\u2019UTR-L, generating TCVSTEM and 3\u2019UTRSTEM-L, respectively (Fig 6B and 6E). These two mutations were predicted to substantially decrease the MFE-75 of this structure (from -9.1 kcal/mol to -17.0 kcal/mol) without altering the sequence of the USR. In-line probing of a 321-nt 3\u2019 terminal fragment from TCVSTEM revealed data consistent with generation of this stable stem-loop (Fig 6C). TCVSTEM accumulated to only 50% of TCV-WT in protoplasts (Fig 6D), suggesting that formation of this hairpin is detrimental to virus fitness. Importantly, even though the USR sequence was unchanged, NMD-resistance was abolished for transcripts of 3\u2019UTRSTEM-L (Fig 6E, bottom). When the \u201cL\u201d sequence was removed to give 3\u2019UTRSTEM, only a 20% increase in RNA accumulation (p = 0.08) was observed with U1D expression (Fig 6E, bottom). The modest effect of the STEM mutation could be due to the close-proximity of the poly-A tail to the stop codon in the 3\u2019UTRSTEM reporter construct. Earlier studies have demonstrated the NMD-inhibitory effects of PABP binding near PTCs [13\u201315].",

As previously found (Fig 1C), sgRNA2 accumulation did not differ when expressed with UPF1 or U1D. However, sgRNA2STEM accumulation increased 1.7-fold with U1D versus UPF1. This demonstrates that sgRNA2 is inherently NMD-resistant, but becomes sensitive to NMD with the STEM mutations, suggesting that unstructured RNA downstream of the sgRNA2 stop codon is important for NMD-resistance.",

Using the TCV MFE as an arbitrary cutoff (-9.1 kcal/mol, S3A Fig), 22.1% of NMD-resistant \u201cother genes\u201d contained highly flexible regions downstream of the stop codon (Fig 7A, S1 Dataset).

When the TCV gRNA is translated, ~95% of ribosomes terminate at the p28 stop codon, with the remainder reading through the stop codon to produce the full-length p88 RdRp [41]. Both the TCV RSE readthrough element and the similarly positioned PEMV-2 RSE frameshifting element prevented degradation of an NMD-sensitive GFP reporter (Fig 3). Recoding has previously been shown to stabilize NMD-sensitive transcripts due to displacement of UPF1 by translocating ribosomes [30, 44]. Viruses from diverse families including members of the Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Luteoviridae, Tombusviridae, Retroviridae, Togaviridae, and Flaviviridae utilize ribosome readthrough or frameshifting to produce their replicase proteins [55]. This widespread translation strategy could serve a dual-purpose by simultaneously producing a required protein and protecting an otherwise NMD-sensitive transcript.",

The CP is the RNA silencing suppressor [35], which is critical for combatting host antiviral responses, and 180 CP monomers interact to form a single virion, which is required for beetle-vectored transmission between plants [56, 57]. The USR immediately following the CP stop codon was required for NMD-resistance of a GFP construct, and NMD-resistance increased 3-fold when the USR was inserted into a heterologous NMD-sensitive 3\u2019 UTR (Fig 4C). No sequence-specific elements required for NMD-resistance could be identified in the TCV USR, including putative PTB binding sites that have only minor effects on NMD-resistance when mutated (Fig 6A). However, since RNA-binding proteins prefer single-stranded RNA for binding [58], we cannot rule out the possibility that the TCV USR binds to an unidentified protein that antagonizes NMD.",

            "text": "Despite TCV and CCFV 3\u2019 UTRs providing strong NMD-resistance, no sequence similarity was found between their respective USR regions (Figs 5 and S2A). The most noticeable difference between NMD-resistant and NMD-sensitive carmovirus 3\u2019 UTRs was a conserved lack of RNA structure in the NMD-resistant sequences. When a stable hairpin was generated in the USR by introducing a downstream 2-base mutation, NMD-resistance was abolished and virus accumulation was reduced by 50% (Fig 6B\u20136F). These findings support a link between limited RNA secondary structure, virus fitness, and resistance to NMD. Emerging research has demonstrated that 40S and 80S ribosomes leave footprints in the 3\u2019 UTRs of some host transcripts and 80S are capable of initiating translation [59\u201361]. It remains to be determined if ribosome footprints in the 3\u2019 UTR correlate with increased NMD resistance. However, we speculate that the association of either ribosomes and/or initiation factors with the 3\u2019 UTR can suppress NMD by occluding UPF1 from the region immediately downstream of the stop codon. Interestingly, plant virus 3\u2019 UTRs (including TCV and CCFV) are highly adapted to recruiting ribosomes and initiation factors to aid cap-independent translation at the 5\u2019 end of the genome [62, 63]. Furthermore, a 116-nt unstructured region upstream of the CP ORF serves as a TCV internal ribosome entry site for early CP translation from the gRNA [39].",

Since UPF1 is an RNA helicase, it was proposed that stable secondary structures harbor elevated levels of UPF1 as a result of reduced RNA unwinding activity [20]. NMD-sensitive transcripts also have statistically significant higher 3\u2019 UTR GC% content compared with NMD-resistant transcripts across the human transcriptome [8]. Using a set of previously identified human UPF1 targets (n = 241) and NMD-resistant transcripts (n = 6,032) [36], we showed that highly unstructured regions of RNA downstream of stop codons were over 4-fold enriched in NMD-resistant transcripts versus UPF1 targets (Fig 7).",

GC% content was also calculated in the 75 nt window for each gene. Virus 3\u2019 UTRs and NMD-resistant 3\u2019 UTRs identified by Toma et al. [53] were analyzed using the same method.
