This up-regulation is the main characteristic of Cytokines Storm Syndromes (CSS). The CSSs are associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) which can be primary or familial (pHLH) or secondary, acquired or reactive (sHLH) [5]. The sHLH, occurring frequently after an infection, are life-threatening syndromes of extreme immune activation leading to a multiorgan failure and a severe hypercytokinaemia [6]. The revised criteria for HLH diagnosis include fever, splenomegaly, bicytopenia, hypertriglyceridaemia or hypofibrinogenaemia (or both), haemophagocytosis, ferritin \u2265500 \u00b5g/L, low NK cell activity, and soluble IL-2 receptor \u22652400 U/mL). Five of the eight criteria in total are needed to make a diagnosis of HLH (\nTable 1\n)\n[7]. It is noteworthy that many of these criteria were described as predictors of COVID-19 mortality[7], [8], [9]. Moreover, pathologic examinations of a COVID-19 patient\u2019s lung revealed patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration and multinucleated giant cells [10]. The latter cells may be haemophagocytes.",

In immunocompetent individuals, intracellular pathogens trigger a T-helper cell 1 (Th1)-type immune response with a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate histiocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells), NK cells and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). These cells continue to reciprocally stimulate each other through receptor interaction and by cytokines. In sHLH, there is a dysfunction of CTLs and/or NK cells leading to the persistence of the antigenic insult which maintains cytokines release [11]. Interestingly, data from China suggests the viral load is higher in patients with more severe disease [12]. This may be due the persistence of the viral insult caused by cytotoxic cells dysfunction.",

            "text": "The HLH Steering Committee of the Histiocyte Society recommends the HLH-94 protocol as standard of care for infection-Associated HLH[15]. The suggested therapy for patients with viral infections and severe sHLH is the use of the combination of etoposide and dexamethasone for eight weeks. Age-adjusted doses of Etoposide are administered once a week with weekly decisions on whether to continue etoposide treatment or not, following the clinical and laboratory response of the patient. Dexamethasone is administered daily starting with 10mg/m2 during the first week then the dose will half decrease every week. It is important to keep antivirals and to provide supportive care: broad-spectrum antibiotics, antimycotic and gastric protection [19].",
