Target minor H antigens include both ubiquitously expressed antigens and those specific for hematopoietic cells. Given these observations with blood cancers, clinicians have been quick to explore whether allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effects might exist and might be therapeutically exploited in various metastatic solid tumors. Malignancies evaluated include colon, breast, prostate, and renal cancers, among others 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Outcomes have been variable. Convincing graft-versus-tumor effects have been reported in a minority of patients with colon and renal cell cancer and possibly breast cancer, whereas patients with other types of malignancy have shown no response.",

In these experiments, we used a canine HCT model in which the kidney served as a surrogate tumor target. The experiment was designed to determine whether adoptive immunotherapy could result in rejection of a specific organ not ordinarily involved in GVH reactions. Stable mixed chimerism in this model was maintained by regulatory T cells 9, 10 and could not be dislodged by infusion of na\u00efve donor lymphocytes [11]. To shift mixed chimerism to all-donor chimerism and induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), donor lymphocytes were sensitized to host minor H antigens [8]. Accordingly, after mixed chimerism was established in donor lymphocyte antigen (DLA)-identical littermate recipients, the marrow donors underwent transplantation of kidneys from their respective mixed chimeric recipients, which they rejected within 3 to 5 weeks. When marrow donor lymphocytes harvested after kidney graft rejection were injected into the recipients, the mixed hematopoietic chimerism converted to full donor chimerism. But although 2 of 5 dogs developed GVHD, the residual native kidneys, which expressed the same minor antigens used to sensitize the donor, were not targeted by the adoptively transferred lymphocytes. Thus, although marrow donors readily rejected their recipients' kidneys and thereby became sensitized to the mixed chimeras' ubiquitously expressed minor H antigens, as evidenced by elimination of host hematopoiesis and GVHD, the level of sensitization apparently was insufficient to induce immunologic damage to the recipients' remaining kidneys.",

A kidney heterotopically transplanted from 1 of the 2 marrow donors into the groin of each trichimeric recipient was stably accepted and then served as a solid organ surrogate for graft-versus-\u201ctumor\u201d reactions. Toward this end, the other marrow donor was sensitized against H antigens of the marrow/kidney donor, and sensitized lymphocytes were subsequently infused into the respective trichimeras. The heterotopic location of the kidney grafts facilitated histological monitoring for lymphocyte infiltration and rejection. In addition, we postulated that the kidney transplantation would give rise to danger signals [13], thereby increasing the likelihood of becoming targets for lymphocytes sensitized to minor H antigens.",

The kidney graft recipients received no immunosuppressive therapy. The vascularity of the transplanted kidney was confirmed by an ultrasonic Doppler flow detector (Parks Medical Electronics, Aloha, OR). At least 2 biopsies of transplanted kidneys were performed before study completion. The tissue specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and stained using hematoxylin and eosin for evaluation by microscopy.

The study was prompted by the desire to understand how graft-versus-tumor effects, typically observed for hematologic malignancies, could be extended to include metastatic solid tumor targets. Several clinical studies have used marrow transplantation to treat various metastatic solid tumors but with very limited success 3, 7. In these studies, no tumor- or tissue-associated minor H antigens were used to sensitize donors against the patients' tumors. Therefore, it would seem reasonable to explore adoptive immunotherapy with specifically sensitized lymphocytes to achieve successful treatment of metastatic solid malignancies. Because no transplantable tumors exist for random-bred dogs, a functioning kidney allograft with a unique set of minor antigens was chosen as a surrogate target, because impairment of kidney function could be easily assessed by serum creatinine levels and histopathologic examinations of percutaneous kidney biopsies.",

What explained this lack of graft-versus-kidney effect, a finding in striking contrast to the speed with which the marrow donors rejected kidneys from their chimeric recipients? We hypothesized that native kidneys lacked the appropriate \u201cdanger signals\u201d [13] to attract lymphocytes, and that these signals were present in the transplanted kidneys. Under this model, danger signals may be either constitutively expressed or, in the case of transplantation, induced on stress, hypoxia, or trauma.",

In all 3 cases, the kidneys were stably engrafted in the trichimeric recipients due to the induction of tolerance established by dual HCT. After immunizing the first marrow donors against minor H antigens of the second (marrow and kidney) donors and then infusing sensitized lymphocytes into the marrow recipients, an immunologic chain of events occurred that supported in part our experimental assumption that an organ that ordinarily is not a target for GVHD reactions might be targeted under appropriate experimental conditions.

Furthermore, and perhaps expected due to sharing of minor H antigens among recipients and kidney/marrow donors, host hematopoiesis also disappeared along with the appearance of GVHD in classical target organs, skin, gut, and liver. Somewhat in contrast with the widespread immunologic damage in allografted kidneys; host skin, gut, and liver; and host and donor 2 hematopoiesis, the hosts' native kidneys showed mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltration (Figure 2), but renal function was not impaired. These findings are consistent with the \u201cdanger signal\u201d hypothesis [13]. The basis of this model was that antigen-presenting cells (APC) are activated by signals from injured cells that had been exposed to toxins, pathogens, and mechanical damage [23]. Also falling into this category were transplanted organs in which surgical and or ischemic damage occurred, resulting in activation of antigen-presenting cells. Thomas et al. [24] reported that long-term renal allografts were established in histocompatibility complex\u2013mismatched macaques treated with deoxyspergualin with or without immunotoxin (anti\u2013CD3-CRM9, a mutant diphtheria toxin). The proposed mechanism of action of deoxyspergualin was the prevention of APC maturation, suppressed expression of costimulatory molecules, and establishment of a state of tolerance. Although in our trichimeric model the transplanted kidneys demonstrated stable engraftment, undetected molecular events may have been involved in the graft-versus-host reaction after DLI. In the transcriptional profiles of histologically normal living donor kidney allografts, Park et al. [25] found ongoing injury response and inflammation at 1-year posttransplantation, with up-regulated genes associated with inflammation, immunity, or response to injury.",

Perhaps more time was needed for renal function impairment to occur; however, the observation time was cut short by the development of life-threatening severe GVHD in the skin, gut, and liver. Nevertheless, it is clear that we successfully induced an immune response against a kidney tissue not normally targeted in GVHD. Further experiments with this model may shed light on immunologic mechanisms to avert GVHD in many normal tissues and may ultimately lead to methods for specifically targeting these responses against solid tumors. Next-generation sequencing studies are currently underway to identify coding of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in breeders and their offspring that are unique to HCT recipients and expressed in tissues. Some of these polymorphisms may display ubiquitous tissue expression, whereas others may be restricted to hematopoietic cells or individual organs, such as kidneys, and thus define sets of H antigens that could be used to sensitize the marrow donor against a candidate target organ. Accordingly, subsequent DLI would result in immune reactions restricted to the desired target organ (e.g., marrow or kidney) without the development of GVHD.",
