For example, RSV infections in infancy are a risk factor for developing allergic asthma in adolescence.

[18] [19] [20] [21] Elucidating the key mechanistic links between specific viral (or bacterial) pathogens and development of new onset asthma is critical not only for better understanding of the link between the upper and lower respiratory tract but also for identifying potentially modifiable factors that could lead to disease prevention.",

Although not every patient with CRS has asthma and vice versa, a strong and independent association between these conditions has been reported. In a large European study, asthma was more prevalent in patients with CRS than without (odds ratio [OR] 2.71). 30 Furthermore, patients with CRSwNP were more likely to have asthma than those with CRSsNP, 31 with one study reporting asthma in as many as 48.3% of patients with CRSwNP compared with only 16.5% with CRSsNP. 32 A study from France also found that most of the asthmatics had abnormal sinus CT scans. 33 Similarly, asthmatic patients with CRS were more likely to have nasal polyps than nonasthmatic patients with CRS. 34 Exactly when (and why) patients develop CRS and asthma remains unclear. CRS is primarily a disease of adulthood, and given that the sinuses do not entirely form until late adolescence, other diseases, including cystic fibrosis, should first be considered in children presenting with nasal polyps. 35 Although asthma can develop either in childhood or later in life, CRS is more significantly linked with adult-onset asthma. 30 In particular, patients with CRS were more likely to develop nasal polyps if they had adult-onset versus childhood-onset disease. 36 Asthma may precede the diagnosis of CRSwNP 37 or develop following the diagnosis of CRSsNP. 38 However, it is more likely that the time frame in which CRS and asthma develop is variable and depends on a variety of yet to be identified factors.",

This is not surprising because, similar to what is observed in most of the asthmatics, nasal polyps in the United States and Europe are predominantly characterized by type 2 inflammation. [50] [51] [52] [53] Eosinophils as well as their granule proteins (eg, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase) are elevated in nasal polyps compared with healthy control sinonasal tissue. 50, 54, 55 Other type 2 immune cells, including mast cells, basophils, and group 2 innate lymphoid cells, are also increased in nasal polyps. [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] This robust type 2 inflammatory response is orchestrated in part by elevated levels of prosurvival and chemotactic mediators such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13, eotaxins, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. 55, [62] [63] [64] In contrast to CRSwNP, CRSsNP was originally characterized by type 1 inflammation due to elevated levels of interferon gamma (IFNg) detected in this subtype. 54, 63 However, subsequent studies have challenged this dichotomy and shown no differences in IFNg levels observed between CRS subtypes. 50,55,65 A more recent comprehensive analysis evaluating the expression of several inflammatory mediators in different sinonasal tissues in CRS suggested that CRSsNP is instead a heterogenous disease. 66 In this work, 23% of patients with CRSsNP had a predominant type 1 phenotype as assessed by IFNg gene expression levels above the 95th percentile of what was observed in healthy controls. Furthermore, 36% of patients with CRSsNP had increased gene expression of type 2 inflammatory mediators above the 95th percentile of what was measured in controls. 66 The clinical relevance of these different endotypes, and why CRSsNP in general has a weaker association with asthma compared with CRSwNP, is unclear and remains the focus of ongoing investigations.",

In a healthy host, these microbes are routinely cleared without inciting an inflammatory response, but in CRS such processes are impaired. 78 It remains unknown if the impaired epithelial barrier leads to increased pathogen recognition by the host or if the exposure to pathogens in the respiratory tract leads to epithelial barrier damage.

            "text": "S aureus is known to colonize the nasal mucosa, 79 and it has been one of the most studied microbes in CRS. One hypothesis suggests that the bacteria itself is directly involved in driving CRS pathogenesis, damaging the epithelial barrier and activating the host immune response. Ex vivo studies of nasal polyp explants infected with S aureus showed reduced gene expression levels of various tight junction proteins when compared with similarly infected healthy nasal mucosa. 80 In addition, in a separate study, S aureus was reported to bind to TLR2 and induce type 2 cytokine release from cultured epithelial cells. 81 This in turn could potentially explain how colonization with S aureus in the nasal cavity could lead to the development of a chronic immunologic response. However, what is not addressed in these studies is why only some patients who are colonized with S aureus go on to develop CRS. Furthermore, in patients with CRSwNP, the presence of S aureus was associated with more severe sinus inflammation on CT scans but not sinonasal symptoms, suggesting this pathogen alone is not fully responsible for all aspects of disease. 82 Another hypothesis is that the immune response to S aureus is important in CRS pathogenesis. In support of this, type 2 inflammatory mediators were significantly elevated in nasal polyps of patients with detectable levels of specific IgE antibodies to S aureus enterotoxins (SAE), but no correlation was found between these markers and the presence of S aureus in the tissue. 83 Specific antibodies to SAEs can induce basophil degranulation 72 and mast cell activation, 84,85 providing another possible mechanism by which S aureus could contribute to chronic type 2 inflammation. However, in a separate study, although patients with CRSwNP were more likely to have elevated serum levels of specific IgE to SAE compared with healthy controls, there was no association between these antibody levels and sinus disease severity as assessed by CT scan. 86 It is important to note that not all patients with CRS are colonized with S aureus, with one study reporting colonization rates of 27.3% in CRS versus 33.3% in healthy controls. 87 Likewise, only 27.8% of patients who were colonized with S aureus had detectable specific IgE to SAE. 87 However, both colonization with S aureus and the presence of specific IgE to SAE were significantly higher in those patients who had both CRSwNP and asthma (66.7% and 53.8%, respectively). 87 In a meta-analysis, nasal S aureus colonization was only modestly associated with asthma prevalence (OR 1.19) in the general population or, after adjusting for study bias, among a subset of patients with CRS (OR 1.21). 88 However, patients with detectable specific IgE to SAE were more likely to have severe asthma [89] [90] [91] as well as reduced lung function and increased airway reversibility to bronchodilation. 92 Taken together, specific IgE to SAE and/or S aureus may be important in CRS pathogenesis and related to comorbid asthma in a select group of patients, but the exact mechanisms for these associations are still unclear.",

To date, no one particular pathogen has been implicated in CRS, but an overall increased abundance and decreased diversity of the microbiome has been observed. 104, 105 It is thus likely that differences in the microbiome are important in CRS pathogenesis and in the link between CRS and asthma. However, further studies are needed to investigate what these key factors could be.",

In acute rhinosinusitis, exposures to viral and bacterial pathogens are the primary driver for acute inflammation in the nose, which can then lead to exacerbations of asthma. In contrast, it remains unclear what precise role infections (or colonization) in the airways play in Sinus Infections, Inflammation, and Asthma the development of CRS, but other factors, including the presence of an impaired epithelial barrier and dysregulated immune responses, can promote the chronic inflammation that is observed in CRS. Clinically, CRS is strongly associated with asthma with both diseases sharing similar underlying inflammatory processes. In conclusion, significant advancements have been made in identifying sinus infections and inflammation as important in asthma pathogenesis, but additional work is needed to further define the specific mechanisms responsible for connecting the nose with the lungs.",

(1) Viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens are the most common cause of ARS, can exacerbate preexisting asthma, and potentially can lead to the development of asthma in certain populations.

(3) The unified airway hypothesis suggests that upper airway inflammation can influence lower airway disease and vice versa further supporting the strong clinical association noted between CRSwNP and asthma.
