            "text": "The potential of a theory based on organizational memes in coevolution with the environment has been postulated, but remains empirically under-developed. This study explores whether understanding organizational memetic variation is empirically possible and, if so, whether it might, with further development, provide managers with early indications of a misalignment between organizational action (operationalized as memetic variation) and strategic intent-the amount of memetic variation needed to stay aligned with the competitive environment. A method for empirically identifying knowledge-based memes in everyday practice is developed. It stems from modern advances in genetics allowing micro-level changes in genes to be linked to macro-environmental dynamics. Using the concept that memetic variation is caused by everyday, uncontrollable uncertainties of interpretation, memetic variation is reduced to seven categorical types. A highly exploratory quasi-experimental design allows a preliminary comparison of a would-be innovative 'Portfolio Management Committee' with self-organizing Internet chat-room settings that are representational of open-source innovation. Results are consistent with predictions showing that higher levels of variation are seen in the latter, despite the former's strategic intent of innovating to stay aligned with a dynamic environment. Further work is needed, however, to test reliability and validity.",

Weeks and Galunic (2003) draw from Dawkins 'selfish gene' and 'meme' extension (Dawkins 1976 (Dawkins , 1982 to propose that a memetic cultural theory of the firm that is particularly able to accommodate the reality that not all of what a firm does is to its advantage. They argue that their 'cultural theory of the firm' is better able to account for the joint interests of both the firm and its employee-members than are either transaction-cost theories of the firm (Williamson 1975) or more recent knowledge-based ones (Kogut and Zander 1992; Boisot 1998) .

            "text": "For neoclassical economists, only 'rational' firms survive (Friedman 1953) . Spencer (1987) emphasized 'survival of the fittest'. Lewontin (1978) emphasized a more accurate phrase, 'survival of the tolerably fit'. In reality, to survive, a firm only needs to be fitter-more rational-than its competitors. To improve its collective rationality, a firm needs to know where its rationality-producing micro processes have broken down. A memetic theory of the firm highlights the likelihood that the intentions of all employees may not add up to something maximizing value, because such intentions are not controllable at an everyday level; yet the 'everyday' transactions are what make up the whole. Memetic analysis can help locate where the breakdown occurs. Weeks and Galunic (2003) define memes as modes of thought. This is incorrect and empirically problematic. Dawkins (1976) , defines memes as the unit of cultural evolution-they '\u2026 propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which \u2026 can be called imitation ' (p. 192, our emphasis) . Durham, cited in Gabora (1997) , defines a meme as 'any kind, amount, and configuration of information in culture that shows both variation and coherent transmission'-just as a gene is a configuration of information in organic life that shows both variation and coherent transmission from body to body (Sect. 2.1). 'Imitation' is a key component of the definition (Blackmore 1998) .",

People do not have full control over how their memes vary, and hence what new knowledge they create, change, and transmit, nor which of these transmitted memes are retained in whose mind. Memes differ from genes in that they vary relatively quickly during social interaction. Burg-elman's studies of Intel (1983 Intel ( , 1991 Intel ( , 2002 show the explanatory power of linking micro and macro analyses to understand organizational dynamics over time in changing environments. Early on, Intel's sustainability was at risk because internal selection pressures failed to mirror rapidly changing external selection pressures. Later, as its competitive environment came to change even more rapidly, Intel's struggle became even more problematic. More recently firms are giving up trying to adapt their own internal selection pressures to the changing external environment; instead, they are exposing variation in the form of innovative products and services directly to external pressures in what has become known as open source innovation (Business Week 2006a). Since selection can operate only if variation is created, organizations are now developing broader, often virtual, networks that create innovation through more variation (Business Week 2006b). Burgelman's (1991 Burgelman's ( , 2002 internal ecology model takes a dynamic view of strategizing generated in high-tech Intel. Strategic initiatives in firms emerge in patterned ways. Variation occurs as individuals (re)interpret these initiatives. Whatever variation is produced is subject to both internal and external selection pressures. There are times and contexts when variation needs to be encouraged and selected for (e.g., when the environment is rich with opportunity and uncertainty) and times when it should be avoided and selected against (e.g., when the environment is unchanging or a topdown strategy needs to be rapidly implemented during a crisis) (Burgelman 2002) . He sees managing variation, production and selective-retention pressures as enabling managers to align deliberate strategic intent with organizational action. Equally, the idea that organizations coevolve with their environment-with the result that neither are unchanging-is empirically under-investigated (McKelvey 1997; Lewin and Volberda 2003) . Others have explored how variation production alters according to the task at hand-for example, the reinterpretation of policies written to deal with risky circumstances involving employee safety is unwise (Rosness 2004 )-whereas idea brokers who bridge functional and meaning silos to create new knowledge produce constructive variation (Burt 2005) relevant to high-velocity environments (Brown and Eisenhardt 1997) . Similarly, internal organizational variation is productive when a new entrant destabilizes the niche, thereby changing industry rules and boundaries (Sampler 1998) .",

Studies a shorter time frame of minutes and hours, whereas Burgelman's work takes place over a longer time frame of years and epochs of CEOs.

Discussion is self-managed without hierarchy or authority. The subjects of the chat rooms include, first, 'Mars'-a chat between a few scientists about the failure of a mission to Mars. The Mars case, therefore, has some similarity to the firm, since both involve a relatively small group of scientists. The second chat is 'Religion'-in which religious people and atheists discuss the question of, Why fear God? This is chosen as a direct contrast to Mars because it involves more people with more diverse views around a less rational, empirically-based subject. Last is 'Gun Policy'-a debate between those pro-and anti-gun policy, chosen because it contains a breach in Netiquette in that one person repeatedly posts information about a petition, which is against Netiquette.",

Religion is a debate about what some might deem objective facts, that others deem subjective; it harbors two distinct communities. Gun Policy contains both objective and subjective facts within both sides of the debate and, over time, contains an alternative, higher-level debate about the concept of freedom. The cases contain increasingly complex mixtures of different types of knowledge, types of communities, as well as interactions between the knowledge and communities. All three contain enough diversity such that the method would be considered a failure if it did not show memetic variation.",

The meeting typically took place over a single day and followed the same formal format. The six people included the MD, the Chief Scientific Officer, the Chief Marketing Officer, a representative from the broader company, the Committee secretary and the Financial Director. Indeed, because of this fear of a lack of innovation one Committee member was championing a move to a process where new development ideas (new projects) were discussed at either 'town meetings', to which the whole company and selected suppliers and customers were invited, or if this proved too unmanageable, a move to an intranet 'innovation jam' style chat room. Attendees/participants would also be asked their view on the new process. This proposed change would be in stark contrast to the current scenario where the Committee alone decided on which development projects to finance and whether the process should be changed. The champion viewed this research as helping them decide whether to make this transition, against a background of a substantial degree of resistance amongst some more established members of the Committee. Fisher (1930) stated that: 'The rate of evolution of a character at any time is proportional to its additive genetic variance at that time' (quoted in Depew and Weber 1995, p. 251) . For the firm to survive in its macro evolutionary niche, it has to acquire a comparable internal rate of variation. Ashby's (1956) Law of Requisite Variety also holds that internal variety has to match external variety. Consequently, to be competitive in its niche (competitive context) the firm should exhibit a high rate of internal variation.",

Each of these offers a test of whether the managers are able to escape groupthink and show the memetic variation necessary to move the firm in innovative directions. 'Project' captures dialogue between the managers and a project manager as a new idea is presented in the quest for resources. This is chosen because it involves an exchange of information between the senior management group and a project manager and is very much part of the standard committee approach to innovation. The 'Internal' case is a discussion about changing internal processes and routines to boost innovation as determined by the pre-set agenda. This is chosen because, unlike the first case, it is by design supposed to be directly innovative. The pressure is to try and create internal processes more able to promote innovation, as the managers wish to go for an IPO, but cannot until they are more innovative. The third case, 'Off Agenda', captures a period of time when the most senior manager, the Managing Director unexpectedly leaves the meeting room. The discussion includes complaints about workload, specifically details of a project not on the agenda but brought into the discussion following a comment about a large pile of papers on the table in front of a manager pertaining to this project.

Presumably, therefore, one might expect the Gun case to be somewhat similar to the organizational setting in that spamming in the Gun case reduces variety creation. The Mars case involves a smaller group of people than the other two chat-rooms and a closer-knit one in that it is composed of scientists and a scientific journalist, making it more or less akin to the management setting. Therefore, one might expect the Mars case to exhibit evolution more like the Portfolio Management Committee if small group size and subject area has an effect on variation. The Project case involves the intention of sharing understanding between senior managers and project managers with a view to dedicating further resource to the project's development. The Internal case does explicitly involve thinking of new ideas but does not explicitly embrace brainstorming rules. The Off Agenda case has no agenda and a slightly differing set of people (when the MD leaves the room). Further, Internal and Off Agenda might be more like the control setting, as in the former case it is intended to promote variation and the latter case is not constrained by a managerial agenda or the presence of the most senior manager.",

First, the management setting is not chosen assuming that it represents all interactions in the organization. It is chosen knowing that innovation is primarily controlled and reviewed at the Portfolio Management Committee meeting and because the organization is questioning whether this meeting is effective in its management of innovation. The comparison is, therefore, between the intentional aims of the meeting under consideration and the actual behavior as analyzed memetically. Second, whereas at the time, internet chat rooms were not seen as organizational, they can now be considered as an organizational context given the use of the Internet by organizations for innovation. The most established case is IBM global innovation jams (Bjelland and Wood 2008) . Furthermore, with the advent of mash-ups and pipes (reusing other people's Internet content and filtering, refining, and recombining it in novel ways) within the semantic web, that in time might well become organizational contexts, the social Internet is a context worthy of study of relevance to organizations.",

What is the smallest set of words within a discourse that holds a meaningful statement about the world? It is a matter of minimizing interpretive freedom: (1) 'Clever' applies to many things and meanings; (2) More words, like 'clever at algebra' narrows it; (3) still more words broadens it, as in 'clever at math and other analytical methods'.

Here we consider any variant, however short lived, as a meme in that it has the chance, however remote, to become longer-lived by being replicated by another person. Another definition could be that it needs to last until it can be implemented to create (or not) organizational value, but this would be a definition that would prohibit us from achieving our aims of looking at innovative potential. We strive to demonstrate how memes can be operationalized and how micro and fast paced variation occurs in organizations. Table 1 summarizes the main differences between memes and genes. Blackmore (1998) asserts that memes evolved because they allow for variation within generations of genetic variation and compete with the faster forms of genetic variation (such as viruses and bacteria). Their copy-fidelity, therefore, is generally lower and they survive for less time. Table 2 highlights what an organizational meme can be, both in general terms using the PC company Dell, as well as the company studied in this paper, and in terms of their variation rates in addition to transmission fidelity and fidelity. Thus, routines are organizational memes that rarely change, but can become unfit if not changed when Is it copied? Is it copied? In both cases copying can have negative effects on fitness but on the whole will be positive when fecundity is high needed. Ideas emanating from open source innovation websites harbor most variants, are unlikely to be transmitted in an unchanged fashion, and survival means they have been internalized within the organization as a strategic idea and sometimes eventually as a routine. Details about the amount of data appear in Table 3 , which shows that each exchange between one person and another within the discourse contains a range of between 1.1 and 2.7 independent and transferable packages of meaning, i.e. memes. In total, some 683 memes within 335 exchanges are analyzed in the Internet-control data-set and 726 memes within 501 exchanges in the management-test data-set. Transcripts of all of the source data are available; they show the conversion to the memetic data sets of each case. Transcripts are exact and therefore include emoticons such as ' :)' that have meaning in the modern day of PCs.",

The memetic framework (Durham 1991; Blackmore 2000) states that each time a meme is expressed it can either be ignored or dropped, explicitly retained unchanged, or reinterpreted in some way, just as a gene might not be retained in the subsequent population, or might be retained intact, or changed in some way. Specific inspiration for Shepherd's analytical method comes from genetics. Genes can change to the point they no longer function in a way that even remotely resembles the function they had previously. Such mutations occur when the DNA is either damaged or changed in a way that alters the message carried by that gene. Single 'point mutations' can cause the death of a gene because the information it harbors is lost. Others can cause new messages to be created that enhance the chances of the gene being retained if it confers advantage. Categories of genetic mutations have been established. Gene inversions alter the order of genes on a chromosome. Gene translocations transport genes onto other chromosomes. Gene insertions and deletions occur. An appropriate analytical approach, therefore, is to determine whether analogous categories can be created that identify the amount of variation lost or created at each opportunity within memetics. This categorization allows an understanding of how much variation is created, in what ways, and whether these dynamics are as intended by the practising managers.",

Above all, the amount of the category emphasis is far more typical of the management setting than the remaining two cases of the control setting.

Again this is as predicted, given this chat room contains a lot of spam but the discussion is amongst many people and is full of many different views.

Banning spam or adhering to brainstorming rules increases variation production. Virtuality, as seen in the cohesive Mars case, does not, per se, increase variety creation. The foregoing differences demonstrate that memetic method appears to be accurate enough to pick up more subtle (within case) differences. Figure 2 arranges the same data into a format of most prevalent category first, second most prevalent second etc, using the management setting as the starting point, thereby allowing it to be viewed from a different angle. In the management setting, the most popular category in all three cases is emphasis and the second most popular category in all three cases is repeat (except in Project where this category is third). The third most popular is no retention (except in Project where it is second). In all cases, the fourth most popular is new dimension, the fifth extension and the sixth most popular is combination. Misinterpretation is the least popular category, indeed none occur in any management cases, of which more later. In the Internet setting emphasis is most popular in Mars, fourth in Religion and fourth in Gun Policy. Repeat is third most popular in Mars, fourth in Religion and third in Gun Policy. No retention is third in Mars, first in religion, and first in Gun Policy. New dimension is second in Mars, third in Religion and fourth in Gun Policy. Extension is fourth in Mars, second in Religion and second in Gun Policy. Combination is absent in all three and misinterpretation is present in all three in equal amounts. Figure 2 actually emphasizes findings in Fig. 1 . Thus, the case, Mars, is similar to the management setting, whereas Gun Policy and Religion are more similar to each other. Gun Policy's variation pattern appears different because of the high number of repeats, whereas Religion is a more 'pure' high variation pattern. Fourth, looking at which categories of memetic variation (akin to genetic mutation or recombination) are found in each setting, differences are found between them. Table 4 summarizes the detail of categorizations of how memes vary, adding in what settings the category is found. Categories repeat, emphasis, extension, new dimension and no retention are found in both settings. Misinterpretation is not found in the management setting whereas combination is not found in the Internet setting. Combination, in the sense of taking a so-called helicopter view, appears to be (more of) a managerial way of adding variation and is arguably a rare strategic skill. As regards misinterpretations, groups of people well versed in exchanges among themselves rarely make the 'mistake' of misinterpretation (management setting) but arguably miss out on highly innovative variation production as a consequence.",

Whether they are being innovative (Internal) or exchanging knowledge to come to an agreement (Project) or having an Off Agenda conversation, they add similar amounts of variation in a very similar way. They are trapped in a type of memetic evolution which is characteristic of scientists solving rational problems in a stable physical world (remember, also, that they were a government organization before going private). As such, their memetic evolution is not as varied as it could be; it is clearly less than that of the control setting and the type of setting they are thinking of migrating to. Virtuality might help, but probably not because virtuality per se (albeit this might be responsible for the misinterpretation category), but because virtuality allows a greater number of people-usually with more diversity-to contribute to the coevolutionary process.",

Previous empirical work looks at how selection-retention forces can be more or less aligned, and with what consequent effects on performance. Selection can, nevertheless, only work on variation and so, if there is insufficient variation, selection will be ineffective however it operates (Kauffman 1993) . Our research, therefore, looks at whether a better understanding of variation-creation dynamics can be created to make the process more manageable.",

Consequently, the kind of empiricism that combines micro/macro evolutionary analysis into a single comprehensive perspective is not much evident in organizational evolutionary research (McKelvey 1997; Lewin and Volberda 2003) or generally in organizational research (Hitt et al. 2007 ). Ours is a tentative first empirical move in organizational research toward the micro/macro resolution we see in biology.",
