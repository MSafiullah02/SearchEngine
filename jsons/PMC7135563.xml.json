Contacts of the index patient were quarantined by government order, resulting in widespread disruption of society and the economy. Had we been better able to distinguish SARS from non-SARS during the epidemic, this disruption could have been reduced. Should the infection reappear, we must be prepared with more precise diagnostic criteria to avoid a repeat of the serious health and societal consequences experienced in the recent outbreak.",

We excluded 83 patients from the study because they were not admitted to our hospital. These included 9 who died in the emergency department (ED), 31 who were transferred to other hospitals, 1 who left, and 42 who were discharged from the ED and isolated at home due to resolution of symptoms within a few days in the ED. Of the remaining 84 patients who were admitted, 53 had convincing evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and 31 patients had no evidence of SARS-CoV infection. These 31 patients had an alternative diagnosis that fully explained their symptoms (Table 1) and all except one who died during hospitalization had two negative anti-SARS CoV. The evidence confirming SARS consisted of either a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a typical clinical course or, in the absence of a positive PCR, a typical clinical course with a definite contact history or evidence that the patient transmitted the infection to someone else. On subsequent serologic testing for anti-SARS-CoV antibody, all 53 patients had positive results.",
