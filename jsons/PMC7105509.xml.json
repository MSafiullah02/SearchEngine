This is what is happening in Korea now in March 2020. Mr. K, a 73-year-old man, was diagnosed with COVID-19 in Gyeonsangbuk-do on February 28 and had been cared at the hospital A in Pohang, 88 km from Daegu. He developed massive hematochezia and was referred to hospital B for intensive care in Seoul, 320 km from Pohang. He received 10,000 mL of blood transfusion at hospital B on March 1. The medical team in hospital B found that he had massive bleeding from huge duodenal ulcer by endoscopy. Bleeding control was strengthened, and he was placed on a mechanical ventilator. He needed an emergency operation at a negatively pressured operation suite, which was not available at hospital B at that time, with already tight operation schedules being carried out. Rapid communications were held among top hospitals in Seoul, and a special transport team from hospital C moved the patient in a very critical condition to the hospital D across the Han River from south to north of Seoul, where he received a successful bowel resection operation. Mr. K has been off the ventilator for a while and appeared to recover, but unfortunately, he succumbed to COVID-19 later. Korean doctors at the frontline of COVID-19 battle work tirelessly to save lives, and this was just one example of their dedication. The numbers shown here are not just the numbers of deceased patients. These are numbers for struggles of those who were infected to survive and for efforts of those who were at the frontline of the field to save lives.",

On March 2, patients in mild conditions were relocated to \u201clife treatment centers\u201d that were temporarily transformed for housing the mild confirmed patients in individual rooms (Supplementary Fig. 1).5 These facilities were initially been used as accommodation facilities for human resource training centers of the local government, universities, or corporations.6 On March 4, there was the first case of mortality in a patient (mortality patient number 32, the national patient number was not available) without significant underlying illness.
