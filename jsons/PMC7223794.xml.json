            "text": "The name \u201cprotein family\u201d was proposed by Dayhoff in the 1960s to describe proteins with similar structure and/or function, which have followed the evolution process from a common ancestor protein (Dayhoff 1969). The GPCR family are physiologically significant membrane proteins that are associated with different signalling pathways and represent one of the most significant target-classes for drug discovery. Two important papers were published about GPCRs in Nature and Nature Review Cancer describing the molecular signatures (Venkatakrishnan et al. 2013) and mutational landscape of GPCRs (O'hayre et al. 2013). Several papers were published about GPCRs in Nature and Cell group journals demonstrating the importance of this family. GPCRs were classified into six families which are- (i) secretin-receptor family, (ii) rhodopsin family, (iii) metabotropic glutamate receptor family, (iv) fungal pheromone A- and M-factor receptors, (v) cyclic-AMP receptors, and (vi) fungal pheromone P- and \u03b1-factor receptors from Dictyostelium (Kolakowski Jr 1994). The secretin receptor family, a well-known member of GPCRs, abundantly expression are found in acinar cells as well as ductal epithelial cells, with negligible levels within pancreatic vascular structures as well as in islets (Siu et al. 2006; Ulrich et al. 1998b). These family members are most abundant in the liver (Alpini et al. 1994), stomach (Bawab et al. 1988) (Gespach et al. 1981; Li et al. 1998), brain (Fremeau et al. 1983; K\u00f6ves et al. 2002) (Nozaki et al. 2002; Yung et al. 2001), reproductive system (Chow et al. 2004), intestine (Andersson et al. 2000), heart (Ishihara et al. 1991), along with lungs (Christophe et al. 1981). GPCRs have extreme therapeutic potential. These receptors are presently used as drug targets of several diseases (Ara\u00e7 and Leon 2020; Purcell and Hall 2018; Vass et al. 2018).",

            "text": "The adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I (pituitary) receptor, also entitled as PAC1, ADCYAP1R1, PAC1R, PACAPR, or PACAPRI, is a protein which is expressed from the ADCYAP1R1 gene in humans. The protein binds with another peptide entitled \u201cpituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide(PACAP)\u201d (Ogi et al. 1993; Vaudry et al. 2000). Calcitonin receptor (CALCR) is occupied with the keeping with the regulation of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and calcium homeostasis. However, the onset of osteoporosis and variations in bone mineral density are associated with the polymorphisms in this gene (Chambers and Magnus 1982; Dacquin et al. 2004; Davey et al. 2008). Corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor is made up of two types of receptors: CRHR1 and CRHR2 and they are expressed by the CRHR1 and CRHR2 genes, correspondingly. This receptor binds to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (Hauger et al. 2003). CRHR1 attaches with neuropeptides of the CRH family of proteins. These proteins are the central controller of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal pathway. CRHR1 is an essential protein that can activate of signal transduction pathways, and it controls various processes which include immune response, stress, obesity, and reproduction, while CRHR2 shows extreme attraction for CRH, and can attach with CRH-associated peptides (e.g. urocortin). It has been noted that CRH is produced in the hypothalamus which acts as a vital responsibility to coordinate the autonomic, endocrine, and behavioural responses to pressure and immune challenge (Aguilera et al. 1986) (Grammatopoulos and Chrousos 2002). Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) is encoded by the GIPR gene, which produces a GPCR which is GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide) and it hinders gastric acid secretion and gastrin release in addition to stimulating insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose (Stoffel et al. 1995). Glucagon-like peptide receptor consists of type 1 receptor (GLP1R) and type 2 receptor (GLP2R). GLP1R is secreted from pancreatic beta cells, and helps in stimulate GLP1R activates the adenylyl cyclase pathway; It affects increased insulin synthesis and liberates of insulin (Drucker et al. 1987). As a result, GLP1R is a possible target for the management of diabetes (Holmes 2003). GLP1R found in the brain, where it is associated with appetite control (Kinzig et al. 2002). The proglucagon peptide synthesises GLP2R. The GCG gene is expressed in this peptide. GLP2/GLP2R helps in augmenting the villus height in the small intestine, stimulates intestinal growth, reduce enterocyte apoptosis, and associated with increased crypt cell propagation. Furthermore, GLP2/GLP2R prevents intestinal hypoplasia, and that is the consequence of total parenteral nutrition. GHRHR gene helps in the expression of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR). Similarly, the GHRH gene helps in the expression of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). The occurrence of receptor association of GHRH causes the production and liberate of growth hormone. Growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), also known as \u201cDwarfism of Sindh,\u201d is caused by the mutations in the GHRH gene. This disorder is categorised by short stature (Murray et al. 2000). Parathyroid hormone receptor has two sub-types: parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 (PTH1R) and type 2 (PTH2R). The PTH1R gene encodes type 1. PTH1R is a receptor for two peptides, which are parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Any deficiency in PTH1R is known to cause different diseases such as Chondrodysplasia Blomstrand type (BOCD), Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC), and enchondromatosis (Calvi and Schipani 2000). The PTH2R gene encodes the type 2 receptor. It is more specific in ligand detection. This gene has a tissue-specific delivery. PTH1R makes active only through the PTH but not by PTHLH. This protein is predominantly available in the pancreas and brain (Bhattacharya et al. 2011). Through the binding secretin, SCTR (Secretin receptor) is activated, and it is the powerful regulator of pancreatic electrolyte, pancreatic bicarbonate etc. SCTR, along with Secretin, may be associated with autism and pancreatic cancer (Dong and Miller 2002) (Felley et al. 1992). Two receptors are associated with the category of the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor, which are vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor type 1 (VIPR1) and type 2 (VIPR2). These receptors are connected with the secretion of exocrine and endocrine, smooth muscle relaxation, ion and water and flux in lung as well as epithelial cell in intestine. Their functions are linked with integral membrane receptors. This receptor acts through the guanine nucleotide-binding. Finally, it triggers adenylate cyclase (Laburthe and Couvineau 2002).",

These variations arise as a result of the fundamental biological process of replication to form DNA, which is then transcribed to RNA and finally translated to create proteins with the help of ribosomes. Thus, the protein amino acid sequence is analysed by researchers to predict the structural and functional protein units through conserved patterns. These highly conserved regions are directly involved in protein\u2013protein interaction (Branden 1999). Researchers can also gain information on protein folding, function, and transport through protein glycosylation, as these conserved regions are essential for the cell\u2013cell interaction and antigenicity (Hamby and Hirst 2008). A protein can be evaluated for evolutionary conservation by comparing the position of functionally and structurally essential amino acids. Therefore, conservation analysis of amino acid residue positions among the family members can uncover the significance of every location for the structure as well as the function of a particular protein (Ashkenazy et al. 2010; Chakraborty and Agoramoorthy 2014). In evolutionary biology, it is essential to know the delivery of a specific family of protein in each species (Herrada et al. 2011), and several proteins have been analysed in such a context to understand their distribution (Atkinson et al. 2011; Peng et al. 2012).",

We found sequence logos in several continuous positions, including 6 to 21, 27 to 43, 70 to 78, 85 to 94, 142 to 153, 155 to 160, 162 to 181, 205 to 220, 227 to 238, 240 to 248, 252 to 312, 316 to 324, 349 to 423, 425 to 430, 432 to 472, 404 to 430, 434 to 574, 583 to 585, 603 to 605, 609 630, 646 to 648, 652 to 654, and 674 to 678. The longest continuous number sequence logo (74) was found between sequence positions 349 to 423. In this study, the maximum height recorded logo is 3.6 bits, and the minimum height recorded is 0.18 bits. This enabled us to visually inspect and examine the significant amino acids that constitute a functionally significant area of the protein. Perrin et al. (2007) found that human B1 family of GPCR show conservation of structurally essential residues comprise of the salt bridge, six cysteines residues, two tryptophan residues, a proline and a glycine. Cysteine residues are required for conserved disulphide bridge formation, and this was confirmed from in our study. However, structure\u2013function relationships proposed by Perrin et al. (2007) recognized a structurally significant salt bridge and aspartic acid residue which is extremely conserved. It is located in the initial segment extracellular domain (ECD1) of receptors in B1 GPCR family members, which are important for the functionality and structure formation of the \u2018family B1\u2032 of this group of receptors. This receptor class is significant for drug development. Therefore, the protein domains that contain these conserved residues are highly important and can be used for drug development, drug targeting, or drug interaction studies (Giaccia et al. 2003. We can understand protein\u2013protein interactions from these highly conserved segments (Li et al. 1998).",

The tree is built by considering the taxonomic lineage of each sequence that has a match to these family members. Three types of trees, a \u201csunburst\u201d tree (Fig. 7a), a \u201cspecies tree\u201d (Fig. 7b), and a \u201cphylogenetic tree for family seed alignment\u201d (Fig. 7c), are depicted. Two types of \u201csunburst\u201d trees were developed: tree segments weight by the number of sequences and tree segments weight by the number of species. These \u201csunburst\u201d trees show each node in the tree as a separate arc, arranged radically with the super kingdoms at the centre and the species arrayed around the outermost ring. This tree information indicates that secretin family member proteins are not only distributed in Homo sapiens but also distributed in several species, including Insecta, Diptera, Cyprinidae, and Mammalia. The \u201cspecies tree\u201d shows the occurrence of this subfamily across different species, including 247 species of Eukaryota, 190 Metazoa and two Choanoflagellida. Harmar et al. concluded that the subfamily was encoded by 15 genes in humans, as well as at least five genes in Drosophila and three in C. elegans (Harmar 2001).",

            "text": "One of the key challenges of biochemical science is to understand the prototype and pattern of evolutionary relatedness, conservation blueprint, and diversification among members of a protein family. Here, we have demonstrated evolutionary relatedness, conservation pattern, and the distribution across species among the different members of the B1-subfamily of the secretin receptor proteins through in silico analysis. The evolutionary architectures of the protein family members suggest that there is a similar evolutionary force that drives diversification across the universal process of evolution, starting from macro-evolutionary processes and proceeding to the micro-evolutionary methods. Ultimately, this process is shaping the diversity of life on Earth. Our findings on evolutionary relatedness and the diversification of B1-subfamily members support the universal branching rule (Herrada et al. 2011, 2008), and we assume that this rule applies everywhere from gene families to protein families, and finally, within the continuous process of speciation. Our analysis impressively suggests that evolutionary relatedness occurs during the branching process. The evolutionary relatedness and branching process are universal for all evolutionary processes; however, limitations of sample size prevent our ability to depict evolutionary relatedness and branching processes universally. Conversely, the evolutionary processes indeed impel biological diversification and evolutionary relatedness across protein family members, as well as the entire history of life.",
