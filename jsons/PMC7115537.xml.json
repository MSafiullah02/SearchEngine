Coronaviruses are large enveloped RNA viruses, so named for the radiating spike proteins found at the surface of the virion (Fig. 1\n; [4]). There are three groups of related coronaviruses and SARS may be a member of a new fourth group [4]. Classification of the SARS coronavirus has been controversial, although phylogenetic similarities may place the virus in a subgroup of the group 2 coronaviruses [5]. Human coronaviruses include three members that cause common respiratory infections [6]. Nonhuman coronaviruses include those that cause respiratory infections in birds, and enteric infections in cattle, pigs, dogs and cats [7]. Some of these viruses affect multiple organs, for example, both mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus are capable of causing respiratory, enteric, neurologic and hepatic infections [7].",

Accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils was also observed [11]. Li et al. [12] noted that a rapid decline of T-cell subsets in the periphery was observed in patients during the acute phase of SARS infection, but they observed restoration of T cells during recovery.

IgM antibodies declined after 30 days and IgG antibodies persisted up to day 210 [14] and antiviral neutralizing antibodies were obtained from convalescent patients [14].

Balb/c mice were infected with 103 or 105 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) and by day 2 after infection, yielded 106 and 107 TCID50 per gram, respectively, from lung tissue. Although no clinical disease was observed, mild and focal peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were observed upon microscopic examination of the respiratory tract on day 2 [18] after infection. The presence of these infiltrates may suggest some mimicry with human clinical features, although much milder. The respiratory tracts of the mice were cleared of the virus by day 7 after infection. Wentworth et al. found SARS-CoV in the stomach, intestine, and duodenum, in addition to the respiratory tracts of infected mice [19]. Subbarao et al. also protected mice from infection by passive administration of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody from previously infected mice, suggesting that neutralization in vivo is possible [18]. Mice clear the virus by day 7 post-infection, while humans begin to clear the infection by days 9\u201314 [8]. A small animal model will allow researchers to test therapeutics and vaccines, and because the mice recover from virus infection so efficiently, also identify host factors that contribute to virus resolution. Hamsters have also been shown to be a good model for SARS-CoV infection, reaching similar titers to those seen in mice [20].",

Some researchers working with cynomolgus macaques reported signs of disease resembling SARS after the monkeys were infected with SARS-CoV [26], [27]. From day 3 post-infection, macaques became lethargic, had a temporary skin rash, and one animal showed signs of respiratory distress [26].

Other groups have reported that cynomolgous macaques show limited pathology, mild disease and upper respiratory symptoms [28], [29].

Examining infected animal models will provide information that will lead to an understanding of the correlates of immunity. Mice have been used to further the understanding of virus neutralization, cytokine upregulation and the minimum requirements for viral clearance, but have yet to show disease that mimics the atypical pneumonia seen in adult humans. While there have been some reports of disease in cynomolgous macaques [26], [27], many groups have not reproduced these findings [28]. A promising animal model may be the domestic ferret. Ferrets show elevated liver enzymes, lymphocytic infiltration and alveolar damage, which has also been observed in humans [8].",

In mice, the virus is cleared in less than 1 week and minor pathology in the lung is observed [18]. Histopathology performed on necropsy samples suggests that lung epithelial cells are involved, although the absence of pneumonia and infiltrating macrophages [18] is disappointing. Stat1-deficient mice may prove promising as an animal model that most similarly mimics human disease [22]. Second, in order to test efficacy, large human populations must be tested in areas where the virus is endemic. Finally, if SARS fails to return, how will vaccine manufacturers test candidate vaccines for efficacy? While the animal rule has been provided for just this type of case, an animal model should mimic human disease in order to be applicable. The final rule was published in the federal register and can be found on the federal register website [45].",

            "text": "Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed in vaccinated and wild-type infections of FIP. ADE is thought to potentiate viral infection through the infection of macrophages. Viral entry into macrophages occurs when antibodies bind the virus and attach to macrophages via the Fc region of the antibody and its interaction with cell surface expressed Fc receptors [46]. Neutralizing antibodies can also be enhancing antibodies if antibody titer is low or is of the IgG class [47], [48]. Because macrophages increase with viral disease, this cell type may provide an abundant reservoir for the virus and thus expansion of the virus in the host. Some similarities between FIP and SARS exist. First, in both cases macrophages can be infected with the virus [9], [49], and in the case of SARS, the etiology of disease is contributed by infiltrating alveolar macrophages leading to pneumonitis [8]. Second, the treatment with corticosteroids and/or interferon alpha ameliorates SARS disease [50], suggesting an inflammatory, immune-mediated disease. While there has been no observation of ADE during SARS infection, it is worth noting that one coronavirus, FIPV, is capable of eliciting ADE and in the evaluation of vaccines, we may want to consider this possible outcome. However, the difficulty in testing animal models for ADE bears the caveat that if ADE is not observed; it has not proved that vaccines are safe with regard to ADE in humans. In contrast, if an animal model for ADE is developed, we may learn more about the mechanism of SARS-induced ADE, which may help form the basis for developing guidelines for safe vaccine development.",

Alternatively, therapeutic vaccines may be useful in the treatment of viral infection.

This suggests that neutralizing antibody alone can prevent viral infection. Neutralization may not require host recognition of the Fc region of the antibody, but the need to develop humanized forms of these types of antibodies may be critical if they are to be considered for use as a treatment. A human monoclonal antibody, derived from a phage display library, was administered to ferrets and protected the ferrets from lung disease and the shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions [24].",

Recombinant HIV particles that express the SARS spike protein may provide insight into cell tropism and receptor expression profiles [35]. Another retrovirus, murine leukemia virus, was used to generate infectious particles containing most of the S protein. Convalescent serum was able to neutralize infection of the recombinant virus in Vero cells [62].",

Mice immunized with a plasmid containing the S protein produced anti-SARS-CoV IgG [64] and developed neutralizing antibodies and a T-cell mediated response resulting in a six-fold reduction in viral titer in the lungs [65]. Plasmids encoding either the S1 or S2 regions of the spike protein elicited antibody production in mice [66]. Neither the S1 or S2 antibodies alone were capable of neutralizing the virus; however, cooperatively they enabled neutralization of the virus, suggesting that both regions of the spike protein are important for host-cell viral entry [66]. The nucleocapsid protein may also stimulate an effective immune response. DNA vaccination with calreticulin fused to the N protein generated SARS-specific humoral and cellular immunity in C57BL/6 mice [67]. Calreticulin was used because it was found to enhance major histocompatibility complex class I presentation of fusion proteins to CD8 (+) T cells [67].",

Many research questions will need to be answered, thus providing the resources necessary to develop an effective and safe vaccine. To be sure that a vaccine will provide coverage for a potentially variable virus, we need to know what the occurrences of viral quasispecies are and how variable are the important epitopes. What are the viral virulence factors and can we use this information to develop an attenuated strain? Can the virus establish persistent infection and can humans be repeatedly infected? We also need to determine the innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovered SARS patients in order to understand how viral clearance comes about. To understand viral pathogenesis we must know how the immune system mediates disease. What is the role of lymphocytic infiltrates and do alveolar macrophages enhance disease or control infection? If we define the ability of the virus to replicate in monocytes/macrophages can we be assured that antibody-dependent enhancement will not be a problem for a SARS vaccine? Most importantly, identification of the natural animal host may launch the further development of large and small animal models for correlates of immunity and drug and vaccine screening. Development of an animal model that mimics human disease will be the single most important advance in the development of a SARS vaccine. Development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV is imperative and research headed in a forward direction will enable the public health community to be ready.",
