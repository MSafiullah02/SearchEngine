Before it was named by the International Committee of Viral Classification on 12 February, 2020, it was called 2019-nCoV. SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes respiratory and digestive tract symptoms [2] , with symptoms ranging from mild self-limited disease to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and even systemic multiple organ failure syndrome. The infection source of coronavirus disease 2019 is mainly patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic infected patients may also become the source of infection, mainly via aerosols from the respiratory tract, but also through direct contact [3] . Elderly people with underlying diseases are more likely to be infected with the virus and develop severe disease and children and infants are also at risk. At present, there are no specific drugs for this disease. The treatment and nursing mainly include antiviral and traditional Chinese medicine treatment, isolation, symptomatic support, and close monitoring of disease progression [3] .",

In this context, medical workers, as the main force in the battle against the epidemic, bear the monumental task. Unfortunately, many front-line personnel have sacrificed their own well-being and have been infected or died, which causes increasing psychological pressure. According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, by 11 February, over 3000 health care personnel in China were suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among them, 1716 were confirmed cases and 5 had died [6] . Previous studies have shown that during sudden natural disasters and infectious diseases, nurses will sacrifice their own needs to actively participate in the anti-epidemic work and make selfless contributions out of moral and professional responsibility [7] . At the same time, nurses would be in a state of physical and mental stress and feel isolated and helpless in the face of health threats and pressure from the high-intensity work caused by such public health emergencies [8] . Previous studies have shown that when nurses are in close contact with patients with emerging infectious diseases such as SARS [9] , MERS-Cov [10, 11] , Ebola [12] , H1N1 [13] , they will suffer from loneliness, anxiety, fear, fatigue, sleep disorders, and other physical and mental health problems. Studies have shown that the incidence of depression, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress among nurses involved in the treatment of SARS patients was 38.5%, 37%, and 33%, respectively [14] . In a study on the psychological status of Ebola patients' caregivers, 29% of respondents felt lonely and 45% received psychological counselling [15] . On the contrary, some studies also demonstrate the positive experience and growth brought by the collective anti-epidemic efforts [13, 16] .",

Nurses from other departments were required to go through three training stages before starting nursing duties for patients with COVID-19: pre-job training, adaptive training by nursing other patients in the infection department, and negative pressure ward training. This process occupied about one week. Nurses who entered the negative pressure ward would work for 0.5 -3 months before being transferred to other non-anti-epidemic positions. Because COVID-19 is a new disease and the medical system and culture of different countries varies, further research is needed on the psychological experience of frontline nurses fighting against COVID-19. Currently, published studies have highlighted the disease prevalence [17] , clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment [2] . Some reports have paid attention to the severity of psychological problems in medical personnel [18] and the urgency of providing psychological care [19] . However, no qualitative studies have been published on the psychological experience of nurses. Therefore, our study aims to understand the subjective experience of nurses participating in nursing COVID-19 patients through semi-structured interviews and to analyse the data using phenomenological methods [20] , providing fundamental data for the psychological experience of nurses.",

In this study, nurses' concerns about family members were consistent with the study of Lee et al. [22] , especially those with elderly and children in the family. The physical exhaustion, psychological helplessness, health threat, lack of knowledge, and interpersonal unfamiliarity under the threat of epidemic disease led to a large number of negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, and helplessness, which have been reported by several studies [8, 10, 11] . We showed that nurses' negative emotions are more pronounced in the first week when entering pre-job training and negative pressure ward for the first time. Therefore, early psychological intervention is particularly important to nurses in an epidemic. It is best to conduct stress assessment and screening of nurses immediately after receiving the epidemic prevention tasks and to provide professional, flexible, and continuous psychological intervention [15, 22] to promote emotional release and improve nurses' mental health [23] . At the same time, it is important to establish early support systems [9] , such as adequate supplies of protective materials, reasonable allocation of human resources, elderly and infant care services for nurses' families, pre-job training, and interpersonal interaction among nurses to facilitate nurses' adaptation to the anti-epidemic tasks.",

            "text": "It is known that coping style, cognitive evaluation, and social support are all mediators of stress. Studies have shown that psychological adaptation and social support play an intermediary role in psychological rehabilitation under outbreak stress [24] . Pressure of the epidemic may prompt nurses to use their medical and psychological knowledge to actively or passively make psychological adjustments. In our study, nurses adopted avoidance, isolation, speculation, humour, self-consciousness, and other psychological defences to psychologically adjust to the situation. It has been demonstrated that all coping measures under the epidemic disaster can alleviate stress and promote mental health [25] . Participants adopted breathing relaxation, music, meditation, mindfulness, and other ways to reduce stress, which was consistent with the study of nurses in the SARS wards that adopted multiple ways to deal with stress [22, 26] . In addition, our results showed active altruism and greater team solidarity, reflecting the study of Kim et al. [10] and Shih et al. [27] . Generally, nurses can adjust their cognitive rationality to adapt to the epidemic, which may also be related to health care professionals' rich medical knowledge and more rational and positive attitude [28] . According to American psychologist Richard Lazarus' stress and coping model, whether the stressors are effective or not depends mainly on the process of cognitive evaluation and coping. When stressed, nurses constantly adjust cognitive evaluation through professional knowledge to promote self-psychological balance, take the initiative to be altruistic, seek team support [13] , take the initiative to reduce stress, adjust sleep, diet and exercise to adapt to internal and external environment changes, and prevent injuries caused by stress, which has positive significance for mental health [23] .",

In contrast, this study established a good relationship of consultation and visit with the participants in an early stage when the participants just accepted the anti-epidemic tasks. We collected the psychological experience data of the participants over time through multiple interviews. This led to a deep understanding of their work experience, resulting in comprehensive and authentic data. Diverging from the results of many studies on the experience of negative emotions during outbreak stress, we found that positive emotions coexist with negative emotions, as well as psychological adjustment and growth under pressure, and preliminarily discussed its impact on nurses' mental health.",
