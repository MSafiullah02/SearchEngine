            "text": "The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly infectious and potentially fatal (Colizzi et al., 2020). Its psychological impact on persons with mental disorders remains unknown. In the absence of a cure or vaccine against COVID-19, lockdown, isolation, quarantine and limiting community interaction are main psychoneuroimmunity prevention strategies proposed by Kim and Su (2020) to reduce pathogen exposure (Kim and Su, 2020). A recent study found that quarantine was not related with the prevalence of mental health problems in the general population (Zhu et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has a sudden and massive impact on health care infrastructure, transportation, daily activity, freedom of movement, and distribution of medical resources globally (Gautam and Sharma, 2020, Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020, Simpson and Katsanis, 2020). The sudden changes could significantly impact the mental health of psychiatric patients as well as reducing their access to psychiatric services (Montemurro, 2020). Furthermore, mental health providers could be burnout as they might be deployed to look after COVID-19 patients (Kim and Su, 2020). Rightfully, focus of health services has primarily been placed on COVID-19. However, we must also be mindful and ensure that psychiatric services are not neglected in the present pandemic. As the psychiatric inpatient wards were found to be perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus (Kim and Su, 2020), most of the stable psychiatric patients should receive treatment at home to reduce the risk of infection.",

Ideally, immunopsychiatry service should safeguard physical and mental health of psychiatric patients by providing telepsychiatry consultation, home delivery of medications, psychological support, rapid testing for coronavirus and monitoring inflammatory markers related to stress and depression during a large infection outbreak. The immunopsychiatry service addresses the biopsychosocial aspects of COVID-19 pandemic (Kim and Su, 2020). Due to the sudden outbreak and lack of experience with COVID-19, most mental health services were unprepared to provide above services and not able to reach out to psychiatric patients during the lockdown. As a result, the needs of psychiatric patients are being neglected during the pandemic. Although there are few known studies to date about the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the general population (Li et al., 2020, Qiu et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b), COVID patients (Zhang et al., 2020), health professionals (Chew et al., 2020, Mukhtar, 2020, Shi et al., 2020, Tan et al., 2020a) and workers who returned to work (Tan et al., 2020b), there remains little research on the psychological impact and mental health of psychiatric patients living in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic was measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) that measures post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in survivorship during COVID-19 pandemic (Tan et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b). The IES-R is a self-administered questionnaire that has been well-validated in the Chinese population for determining the extent of psychological impact after exposure to the public health crisis within one week of exposure (Zhang et al., 2014). The total IES-R score was divided into 0\u201317 (normal), 18\u201323 (PTSD like symptoms) and >24 (diagnosis of PTSD).(Lee, Kang, Cho, Kim, and Park, 2018) Mental health status was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) based on a tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics (Le et al., 2019). DASS has been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measure in assessing mental health in the Chinese population (Ho et al., 2019, Quek et al., 2018). DASS was previously used in research related to SARS (McAlonan et al., 2007) and COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b). The sleep quality of respondents was measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (Bastien et al., 2001). The total ISI score was divided into no clinically significant insomnia (0\u20137), subthreshold insomnia (8\u201314), moderately severe clinical insomnia (15\u201321) and severe clinical insomnia (22\u201328).",

As a result, immunopsychiatry service should offer point-of-care test for the detection of COVID-19 and negative findings can offer reassurance to psychiatric patients. Contributing factors to worsening mental health were likely delays in delivery of psychotropic medications, lack of access to primary care or outpatient clinics, increased financial difficulty, personal concern of contracting COVID-19, long duration of staying at home as well as more impoverished living conditions due to shortage of supplies in the weeks following the outbreak.

First, immediate mental health care needs of psychiatric patients were a lower priority when the number of COVID-19 cases rose sharply in the city. Second, psychiatric patients were encouraged not to visit the hospital as health services were devoted to managing terminally ill patients and suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Third, the lockdown measures made it difficult for patients to see psychiatrists and other mental health care providers due to insufficient healthcare resources along with fear of contracting COVID-19 in hospitals which managed patients infected by COVID-19.",

After the COVID-19 epidemic, mental health preparedness and anticipation of future outbreaks will lead to an increased awareness of the needs of psychiatric patients and contingency plans to be put in place. Telepsychiatry emergency services or hotline should be made available to patients with intense suicidal ideation. Improved access to telepsychiatry services, home delivery of psychotropic medications, online psychiatric first-aid resources, and infectious disease outbreak preparedness play a pivotal role in minimising the severity of psychiatric symptoms experienced by psychiatric patients. As depression and stress are associated with an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) (Lu et al., 2017), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Liu et al., 2012), Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (Osimo et al., 2020) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (Ng et al., 2018), future immunopsychiatry service and research should monitor the relationship between levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and depression in psychiatric patients during the pandemic. Similarly, PTSD is associated with enhanced interleukin-6 response to mental stress (Lima et al., 2019). If pro-inflammatory cytokines were found to be increased in psychiatric patients during lockdown, further research is required to evaluate pharmacological intervention (Lee et al., 2018a, Lee et al., 2018b) and non-pharmacological intervention (e.g. physical activity) to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (Simpson and Katsanis, 2020).",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general public was found to spend more time at home (Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b). Telepsychiatry and smartphone-based behaviour therapy should focus on relaxation exercises to counteract anxiety, PTSD-like symptoms, anger, and irritability. Sleep hygiene can improve sleep quality and circadian rhythm as part of the psychoneuroimmunity preventive strategies (Kim and Su, 2020). Activity scheduling (e.g., home-based exercise) can improve physical health status in the home environment (Zhang et al., 2015). Further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of these psychoneuroimmunity preventive strategies to enhance resilience (Ho et al., 2020). Based on our findings, psychiatric patients expressed significantly higher levels of worries about their physical health. Telepsychiatry and smartphone-based cognitive therapy can challenge cognitive biases where psychiatric patients tend to overestimate the risk of contracting from COVID-19 or underestimate their physical health status (Zhang and Ho, 2017)",

Previous studies have shown widespread discrimination against people with psychiatric illnesses in China (Zhang et al., 2019). In this study, respondents with psychiatric illnesses did not experience additional discrimination during the COVID-19 epidemic. One possible explanation was that society held more negative views towards COVID-19 as compared to psychiatric illnesses during an outbreak of a life-threatening infection. Respondents with psychiatric illnesses did not show an increase in alcohol intake as compared to healthy control groups. This observation is different from the previous study, which reported the increase in alcohol intoxication and abuse after natural disasters (e.g., earthquake) (Tembe et al., 2019). As the government implemented outing restriction during the COVID-19 epidemic for all citizens, people with and without psychiatric illnesses did not have frequent access to purchase alcohol from local supermarkets. Also, entertainment venues, bars, and restaurants were ordered to cease operation and these measures further reduce alcohol intake of psychiatric patients and healthy controls. Levels of PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia were not related to educational level, age and gender, indicating that all sectors of the community were adversely affected.",

First, there are limitations in generalising the sample of psychiatric patients as they suffered from non-psychotic psychiatric disorders, which was due to a restricted sampling during COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Their capacity to complete an online questionnaire attested to the fact that the psychiatric patients were less severely ill. Second, we were not able to obtain biological samples such as levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to lockdown. Third, the sampling of this study was voluntary and conducted online when strict lockdown measures were in place. Psychiatric patients who did not have access to emails and the Internet were excluded and resulted in a low response rate. Fourth, this was a cross-sectional study, and we could not demonstrate the cause and effect relationship between self-perceived health status, underlying psychiatric condition, and psychological impact. Additionally, this study was performed in only one hospital and might not reflect trends seen throughout China. Despite these limitations, this is the first study that examined the psychological impact on people with and without psychiatric illnesses in a city severely affected by the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures.",

The results of this study suggest that psychiatric patients were at a higher risk of displaying higher levels of symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia, worries about physical health, anger and irritability and suicidal ideation as compared to healthy controls. From immunopsychiatry service viewpoints, there should be more awareness regarding psychiatric patients as targets for care with continuous psychiatric intervention during the pandemic of life-threatening infectious diseases.",
