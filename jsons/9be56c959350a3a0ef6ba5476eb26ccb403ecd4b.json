The schools and nursing schools has been closed. Most of the people started to work from home. Children stayed at home with parents. The interesting observation in the number of patients admitted due to burns in Paediatric Trauma Centre in Wroclaw (Poland) in March 2020 was made.

On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in the city of Wuhan, in central China [1] . Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster [1] . The disease was spreading in Europe. On March 4, 2020, the first case of coronavirus disease was reported in Poland (in Zielona G\u00f3ra) [2] . On March 11, the classes at schools were cancelled. schools, kindergartens and nurseries were closed. The seasonal changes in the epidemiology of thermal burns is related to the fact that most of injuries in small children take place at home. It is worth noting that the incidence of burns is affected by climatic differences. In regions of the world where there is seasonal temperature variability, burns are more common in the winter months [3, 4] . The surprising increase in the number of cases of paediatric burns can be related to the fact that children stayed at home with parents, who apart from looking after for them were supposed to work (\"home-office\"). A stay-at-home order to restrict movements of population as a mass quarantine strategy for suppressing pandemic by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or going to work in essential businesses was implemented. The pandemic is difficult experience for all the population. The problems with achievement of the WHO24h movement behaviour guidelines which recommend 60 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for 5-17 year olds were noticed [5] . Moreover, the difficulties due to social distancing among adolescents, who grow in independence [5] . So far, there are no data about the changes in the number of burn injuries due to the restrictions.",
