A metaanalysis of CRP in community-acquired pneumonia showed widely varying sensitivity and specificity estimates with significant heterogeneity.25 Similarly, a metaanalysis of patients with fever of unknown origin failed to show utility for CRP in identifying patients with bacterial vs. nonbacterial infection.23 However, CRP may have greater utility in distinguishing between bacterial and nonbacterial illness in the critically ill population than in the general hospital population. In a study of 16 ICU patients with H1N1 influenza and 9 ICU patients with bacterial pneumonia, CRP levels were much lower in the H1N1 population (mean, 118 mg/L vs. 363 mg/L).26 In this study, a CRP cutoff of >200 mg/L identified patients with bacterial pneumonia with 100% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity.

CRP levels always rise postoperatively, peaking around postoperative day 3 (POD3).32\n,\n33 However, persistently high CRP levels after POD3 are suggestive of infection. Retrospective studies have shown that elevated postoperative CRP levels (>190 mg/L on POD3 or >140 mg/L on POD4 or POD5) have a sensitivity of 66%\u201382% and a specificity of 77%\u201386% for infection.33., 34., 35. Prospective studies have generally confirmed these results; a prospective study of 151 mixed surgical patients showed that CRP >100 mg/L on POD5 had a sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 64% for infection,33 while a separate study of 50 patients showed that CRP >130 mg/L on POD4 had a sensitivity and specificity of 80% for anastomotic leak. A large prospective study is currently underway with 500 patients, which should provide more clarity on this issue.\n37\n",

An increase in CRP of \u226522 mg/L in the first 48 hours of therapy was associated with ineffective antibiotic therapy with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 67%.39 Treating physicians were not blinded to CRP levels, so rises in CRP may have contributed to the decision to change antibiotics in some patients. A separate cohort study of 68 patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia showed that CRP levels declined significantly within 96 hours of initiating adequate antibiotic therapy but not in patients receiving inadequate antibiotic therapy.40 A decline of at least 20% in CRP at 96 hours had a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 87% for effective antibiotic therapy.40 Finally, amongst hospitalized patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, appropriate antibiotic therapy was associated with a >60% decrease in CRP by Day 3 of antibiotic therapy and >90% decrease by Day 7.41 Thus adequate antibiotic therapy is generally associated with significant decreases in CRP by Day 3 or 4 of therapy; however, this effect may be more pronounced in non-ICU patients than in ICU patients.",
