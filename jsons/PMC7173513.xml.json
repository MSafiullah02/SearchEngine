The normal flora is well adapted to its niche and forms a complex, metabolically interacting community. Although age, diet and exogenous factors such as antibiotic treatment may induce important variations, the microbial population of the gastrointestinal tract seems to be stable in each individual. The fecal flora is much more diverse in vegetarians than in omnivores or carnivores, probably reflecting the difficulty of digesting complex carbohydrates found in plants. Facultative anaerobes such as Escherichia coli, which are frequently used as markers for environmental pollution with human feces, represent less than 1% of the normal flora.",

For example, Parvoviridae have only two open reading frames, whereas the vaccinia poxvirus has 263 known genes. Genomes may be linear or circular, segmented or nonsegmented. Genome segmentation facilitates genetic exchange between coinfecting virions in a process known as reassortment. Many viral nucleic acids contain modified nucleotides, which inhibit host cell nucleases and/or mediate recognition by viral polymerase. Linear genomes often contain conserved terminal sequences. When complementary, these allow partial circularization of the genome via formation of panhandle or tube-like structures. Terminal sequences may also allow incomplete replication products to recombine or mediate recognition by proteins that prime transcription or replication. Retroviral proviral DNA is flanked by repeat sequences similar to those of transposable genetic elements.",

            "text": "In the Baltimore classification, seven major viral replication strategies are distinguished (see following and Figure 2-2\n).\u2022Class IV viruses contain positive-strand RNA viral genomes that serve as mRNA. After entry, translation of the genome produces a polyprotein that is processed via enzymatic cleavage, at least in part in an autocatalytic fashion. Replication may be regulated by the unavailability of functional viral proteases needed to make viral structural proteins until later in the replication cycle, as synthesis of viral complementary RNA and new viral RNA proceeds. As viral proteases accumulate, core proteins are efficiently processed, assembled and begin to encapsidate viral RNA. This strategy is used by picornaviruses and Flaviviridae, including hepatitis C viruses. In other (+)ssRNA virus families, including Coronaviridae, Caliciviridae and hepatitis E virus, the viral complementary RNA is a template for transcription of both full-length vRNA and subgenomic transcripts encoding structural proteins, allowing regulation of expression.\u2022Class V viruses, including Orthomyxoviridae and Bunyaviridae, have (\u2212)ssRNA genomes. After entry, primary transcription generates full-length viral complementary RNA (positive-strand) which acts both as mRNA for viral protein synthesis and as a template for transcription of new viral RNA. Alternatively, the incoming viral RNA may initially be transcribed into mRNA messages for individual genes, which must accumulate before transcription of full-length viral complementary RNA and replication of viral RNA can occur (e.g. Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae). The late phases of replication, transcription and viral protein synthesis proceed simultaneously. The Arenaviridae and some Bunyaviridae use a more complicated strategy, termed ambisense, wherein both viral RNA and viral complementary RNA serve as templates for mRNA transcription by the viral polymerase. This does not result in the formation of complementary double-stranded (ds) mRNAs, as different portions of the genome are transcribed from the viral and complementary RNA strands.\u2022Class III viruses, the Reoviridae, have double-stranded, segmented RNA genomes. These include Colorado tick fever virus (Coltivirus) and rotaviruses. Virions have 10\u201312 dsRNA segments and replication resembles that of (\u2212)ssRNA viruses in that RNA is not infectious, and transcription of segment-length mRNAs using the negative strand of the genomic dsRNA must first occur before genome replication. Both transcription rate (inverse to segment length) and efficiency of translation (varying up to 100-fold) may regulate viral replication.\u2022Class II viruses have single-stranded DNA genomes used as templates for transcription of viral protein messages needed for synthesis of complementary DNA. Double-stranded DNA is a replication intermediate, and DNA replication is dependent on repeats that form structures on one or both ends. The Parvoviridae include the B19 erythrovirus that causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children and exanthem, arthropathy and temporarily halts hematopoeisis in adults. This family also includes the apathogenic adeno-associated dependoviruses (AAV). Parvoviridae have 4.5\u20135.5 kb ssDNA genomes and only two open reading frames, one of which codes for between two and four nonstructural proteins and the other coats polypeptides. The Circoviridae have circular ssDNA genomes. This family includes Torque Teno viruses (TTV, TTMV), which cause widespread human infection without evidence of disease.11\n\u2022Class I viruses have dsDNA genomes. Replication proceeds to cell lysis or latency depending on cellular conditions. The lytic phase can be subdivided into early and late phases. In the early lytic phase, viral genes alter cellular conditions to allow efficient viral DNA synthesis and transcription, often activating the host cell and inducing cell division. In the late lytic phase, viral structural proteins accumulate; virions are assembled and then released upon death of the cell. In latency, viral gene expression is confined to functions that prevent replication while maintaining the viral genome within the cell, often for the lifetime of the individual. When cellular conditions become favorable, the latent virus can be \u2018activated\u2019 into lytic replication.There are many dsDNA viruses of medical importance for humans, including the herpesvirus family (see Chapter 166) and adenoviruses.\u2022Class VI viruses are termed retroviruses: viruses enter the cell and uncoat, discharging the pre-integration complex, consisting of the polyadenylated, diploid viral RNA genome together with nucleoproteins, the viral reverse transcriptase and the viral integrase. The two RNA genomes are converted to a single, mostly dsDNA copy by reverse transcriptase in a process requiring template switching. The viral integrase then cuts the host genome and inserts the linearviral DNA into the chromosome as a provirus. This process may require cellular activation and/or cell division, though retroviruses can persist for weeks at stages before integration. Integrated virus may become latent, with limited or no transcription by cellular RNA polymerase II, until conditions allow virus replication.More complex retroviruses (e.g. spumaviruses, lentiviruses) first transcribe multiply-spliced mRNAs that direct the synthesis of regulatory proteins. As these accumulate, the processing of viral transcripts changes and more singly or unspliced mRNAs coding for viral structural proteins are produced. For example, HIV Rev protein, produced from early, multiply-spliced RNA transcripts, prevents splicing and allows nuclear export of singly-spliced and unspliced messages. These viruses (and many other viruses) also co-opt many cellular pathways, including protein sorting and ubiquitination, to modify the abundance of host proteins that would otherwise target the virus for immune recognition or otherwise interfere with virus replication.12\n\u2022Class VII hepadnaviruses, including hepatitis B virus, encode genetic information in dsDNA but use reverse transcription during infection in the cell to produce the negative strand of viral DNA, which in turn is used as a template for synthesis of positive-strand viral DNA.\n",

Those solvents dissolve the dye from gram-negative bacteria that are counterstained with a contrasting dye such as safranin. This dichotomy reflects their distinctive cell wall structures. Gram-positive bacteria characteristically have a thick cell wall made up mainly of large molecules of peptidoglycan. Gram-negatives have a thinner peptidoglycan layer surrounded by an asymmetric lipid outer membrane, the outer layer being composed of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) (Figure 2-3\n). Because gram-negative bacteria have two lipid bilayers, they must use active transport systems and protein channels to import water-soluble molecules and nutrients. Export of proteins is accomplished through complex protein structures called secretion systems.14\n",

Portion A mediates the enzymatic activity responsible for halting protein synthesis in the target cell while portion B binds to a cell receptor and mediates the translocation of the A chain into the cytosol. Portion B accounts for the cell and species specificity of the A\u2013B toxins. The B chain of diphtheria toxin recognizes a heparin-binding precursor of epidermal growth factor, an important hormone for cell growth and differentiation. Uptake of diphtheria toxin proceeds via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Acidification of the endocytic vesicle induces a conformational change in the enclosed holotoxin, enabling the A subunit to traverse the membrane and reach its cytoplasmic target. The A subunit of diphtheria toxin catalyzes ADP ribosylation of the elongation factor-2 (EF-2), inactivating it. The tox gene is encoded by a phage and is under the control of the repressor protein DtxR, which forms an iron complex, DtxR-Fe (Figure 2-11\n), that binds DNA and represses tox expression. Thus diphtheria toxin is only synthesized under low iron conditions, suggesting that it may be produced to stimulate iron release from target cells. Interestingly, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A has a very similar structure, but uses a different cell receptor: the \u03b1-2 macroglobulin low-density lipoprotein receptor. Like diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis but the toxin is released only after passage through the Golgi system.",

Some (\u2212)ssRNA viruses use both vRNA and vcRNA as templates for transcription of mRNA (arenaviruses, some bunyaviruses).

Phase variation depends on the orientation of a DNA fragment adjacent to the type A flagella gene. When A is expressed (i) from the promoter in the invertible fragment, the repressor for the type B flagella is expressed at the same time. As a consequence the type B flagella gene is repressed. Inversion of the DNA fragment abolishes expression of the A-repressor gene and the B-repressor gene (ii). In this situation type B flagella are produced.
