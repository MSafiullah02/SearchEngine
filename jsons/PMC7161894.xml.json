            "text": "Our understanding of immunological tolerance is challenged by the discovery that most multicellular organisms are \u201cholobionts,\u201d consisting not only of a \u201cgenetic self\u201d but an equally important \u201ccommensal and symbiotic self\u201d represented by the host microbiome. Not only is most of the microbiome acquired after clonal selection or deletion have already shaped the immune system, but the microbiome can change with time, geography and diet, altering the overall antigenic make\u2010up of the holobiont \u201cself\u201d 1, 2. How can such antigenic alterations be tolerated? The conceptual difficulties are enhanced by increasing numbers of observations that autoimmune diseases are often (perhaps always) associated with significant alterations in the host microbiome, and conversely, that autoimmunity may be induced, modified or even prevented by various manipulations of the host microbiome. In Sjogren's syndrome, tear\u2010 and saliva\u2010producing cells are attacked, and patients harbor higher numbers and frequencies of Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Candida albicans, and slightly lower proportions of Fusobactera and Prevotella spp. than unaffected individuals 3. Many of these microbes, as well as Escherichia coli, produce peptides that induce autoantibodies reactive against Sjogren's syndrome autoantigens 4. Similarly, rheumatoid arthritis patients exhibit decreases in Haemophilus spp. and concomitant increases in Prevotella copri, Lactobacilli, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. These microbes exhibit antigens that mimic RA autoantigens 5, 6. Behcet's syndrome (an autoimmune disease causing inflammation of the circulatory system) is similarly characterized by specific depletion in the genera Roseburia and Subdoligranulum\n7. And specific alterations in the microbiome that will be reviewed below are present in type 1 diabetes mellitus and Crohn's disease. How can such specific changes in the microbiome be related to autoimmune\u2010disease\u2010related loss of tolerance to \u201cgenetic self\u201d?",

The risk of holoautoimmunity will therefore, be a function of how well the overall holobiont ecosystem is balanced. Any factor that can modify a key element of that ecosystem may also alter the rest. For example, recent research demonstrates that a functional microbiome is established partly at birth, as a result of exposure of the infant to its mother's microbiome while passing through the vagina. Infants born by ceasarean section do not have such exposure. Significant differences in susceptibility to allergic and autoimmune diseases have been associated with caesarean births 116, 117. Another factor is diet: Spicy foods can contain compounds with antibiotic properties, such that the ingestion of them can increase susceptibility to holoautoimmunity 118, 119. Antibiotics themselves can alter the risk of autoimmunity by altering the microbiome. And recent studies suggest that cancer therapies are mediated by the gut microbiome, implying that cancer risk may be mediated similarly 120. Such cross\u2010talk may help to explain the effectiveness of microbially derived adjuvants in cancer therapy and the apparent effectiveness of Coley's toxins for some cancer types. Thus, specific deviations of the microbiome from normal may precede and predict particular holoautommune diseases.",

The microbiome is not determined by the immune system, but is highly constrained by that to which the immune system is tolerant. Loss of tolerance to \u201cgenetic self\u201d or \u201cmicrobiome self\u201d leads to holoautoimmunity, affecting both \u201cselves\u201d simultaneously. In consequence, every autoimmune disease is accompanied (and perhaps preceded) by characteristic alterations in particular portions of the microbiome corresponding, by molecular mimicry, to the host target of the disease. Conversely, what appears to be an autoimmune disease against the host may, in fact, be initiated against microbiome constituents that mimic the host antigens targeted in disease. Manipulating the host microbiome will therefore, affect host immunity and susceptibility to autoimmunity. The six tests carried out in this paper provide initial data confirming the plausibility of the hypothesis, but far more data\u2010intensive tests are clearly required to validate the details. Most importantly, the hypothesis provides a rationale for using alterations in TcR repertoires to identify possible multifactorial microbial triggers of holoautoimmune processes, from which new animal models might be developed, and treatment strategies (perhaps involving microbiome manipulation) devised.",

Commensal and symbiotic microbes making up the microbiome of the host are tolerated by the immune system in part because they express a significant number of antigens mimicking both host antigens and the TcR \u201cimmunological mirror\u201d (Tables 1 and 2). The result is simultaneous tolerance for a \u201cmicrobiome self\u201d and \u201cgenetic self\u201d that overlap. Some potential antigens, such as plant viruses (upper right) neither mimic nor are complementary to human hosts, and interact with neither their cells nor their TcR. The bottom part of the figure illustrates how pathogens can be defined by their molecular complementarity to the host antigens. Only microbes able to interact with host physiological processes can become pathogenic (center). TcR mimic host antigens and prevent or counter infections by pathogens by means of molecular complementarity to antigens on the pathogen (right). Thus, agents that are not molecularly complementary to the host are of no physiological or immunological importance (in keeping with the plant bacteria, fungi, and virus data presented here [Tables 1 and 2]). B, Bottom: A visual summary of the concept of holoautoimmunity. At the top, some pathogenic microbes express antigens that mimic antigens of the microbiome and of the host, as well as host TcR (Figs. 1, 2, 3). In consequence, (below), antibodies induced against pathogenic mimics may recognize, through molecular complementarity, not only the pathogenic antigen, but also, to a greater or lesser degree, the \u201cmicrobiome self\u201d antigen, the \u201chost self\u201d antigen, and the TcR that the pathogenic antigen mimics.
