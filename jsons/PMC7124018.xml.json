There can be no doubt that protecting consumers from gambling addiction is a highly legitimate motive that can justify restrictions to cross-border trade in gambling services. Until recently, the pan-European discussion in the legislative branch was very limited, and the Internal Market Courts consequently became the main \u2018fora of discussion\u2019 of gambling issues. In line with the adversarial setting of court proceedings and the financial consequences that are at stake,1 private operators and public monopolies have usually continued their quarrel outside the courtroom immediately after the release of a new ruling. The aim has been to gain the high ground regarding the \u2018correct interpretation\u2019 of the judgment and to highlight alleged points of victory.2\n",

Different objects of addiction stimulate similar neurobiological pathways: the biochemical reactions in the brain are similar.84 Research with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated an anticipation or pre-use thrill for different objects. Pathological gamblers show the same kind of excitement when shown pictures of casino tables comparable to the effect on cannabis addicts when shown a joint. Former pathological gamblers who had not played for five years show only weak reactions.85 This shows that the pre-use thrill experience is not chronic and that, with successful recovery, neurobiological reactions fade out over time. It was further shown that beauty and money can stimulate the dopamine reward system in similar ways as the anticipation of cocaine use in the case of cocaine users.86 Our reward system is open to accommodate many different substances and behaviours that we may experience in some positive way.

The Court of Justice therefore asked the referring court to consider in its proportionality review in particular the scale of advertising and the creation of new games. 267 Importantly, the Court drew a new distinction that should guide the assessment whether the monopolist was going beyond a mere (permitted) channelling of consumers:\nIn particular, a distinction should be drawn between strategies of the holder of a monopoly which are intended solely to inform potential customers of the existence of products and serve to ensure regular access to games of chance by channelling gamblers into controlled circuits, and those which invite and encourage active participation in such games. A distinction must therefore be drawn between a restrained commercial policy seeking only to capture or retain the existing market for the organisation with the monopoly, and an expansionist commercial policy whose aim is to expand the overall market for gaming activities.268\n\n",

Where demand is inelastic, it generally does not pay to install and enforce a prohibitive approach. This has been concluded (even) for products much more controversial than gambling.307 Where many people wish to consume a certain product, it will eventually be offered \u2013 legally or illegally \u2013 if financial gains are expected by the producers \u2013 or in the case of gambling \u2013 the operators.308 Prohibitive approaches are problematic as they regularly lead to undesired side effects that are hard to control due to the illegality of the product or activity.309 Zinberg observed already in the 1980s in relation to drug policy that public debates all too often ignored two related factors, which made the issue of permanent prohibition largely academic. Slightly provocative he stated that even though drug use similar to pregnancy could be avoided by abstinence, it does not seem that mankind has opted for total continence in both cases. Furthermore, the prohibition of drug using in the US had not been any more effective than the earlier attempt to eliminate alcohol use in the 1920s.310\n",

He also concluded that the overall impact on the general population was likely to be rather small. He argued that a differentiation between different markets was necessary. In a competitive licensing market, advertising is likely to affect the size of market share of competitors. In a monopolistic market by contrast, advertising is likely to affect the total sales in that market. The impact of advertising in mature markets is likely to be different from young markets. In the latter, advertising efforts for games of chance may increase the overall participation rate of a population; by contrast, advertising effects in a mature market may fade out.

Until recently, the Court of Justice focused on the encouragement/incitement component of advertising.

The available empirical evidence suggests that this aspect is central, namely that people exposed to advertising \u2013 particularly adolescents \u2013 get informed about the chances and risks of gambling. Advertising that invites people to gamble or the fact that people hold positive views towards gambling is not per se something that will necessarily lead to higher prevalence of gambling disorder. An advertising policy becomes detrimental where it fails to strengthen the awareness of harmful effects of gambling.332 What seems to matter is the overall perception of gambling, namely whether consumers of a given jurisdiction receive a balanced picture of gambling. They must also be aware of the risks that gambling involves.3323 Regulators can opt for different ways to achieve effective information of consumers and specifically vulnerable groups on gambling-related risks: counter-advertising messages can be included in advertising, authorities may run public education programmes or advertising possibilities may be restricted or prohibited. In this author\u2019s view, it makes little sense to allow for unrestricted advertising in terms of volume and message content followed by an attempt to counter-balance it with (costly) public education programmes. Where the legislator allows the advertising of activities that involve significant risks for consumers, it also takes up a certain responsibility333 \u2013 irrespective of the actual regulatory model that it chooses (monopoly, limited or liberal licensing system).",

The fears are not surprising as a couple of factors explain their presence. First, games of chance over the Internet have only been professionally commercialised for slightly more than a decade. Empirical research is much younger than on land-based gambling, and their impact on the prevalence of disordered gambling still needs to be followed up in long-term studies. Second, though the online share of the gambling industry is still clearly smaller, it is rapidly growing and at much higher rates than land-based gambling. Third, online gambling aliments concerns in a double manner: the services not only relate to gambling but in addition to the medium Internet. The latter in itself aliments disputes over the opportunities and risks of this new technology, in particular for youth.365 Popular media may report about \u2018Internet addicts\u2019 who spend several days in front of the Internet.

The referring Austrian court seemed to suggest that the regulatory interests of the Austrian government were already sufficiently taken into account in the state of establishment of the online operator (Malta) and that in fact the Maltese provisions were more rigorous than those applicable in Austria.442\nDickinger & \u00d6mer was the first case in which a Member State intervened to support the private parties and not the government of another Member State. The Maltese government emphasised its pioneer role in ensuring controlling and monitoring mechanisms specifically designed for online games of chance. There were strict access controls, such as an examination of the operators\u2019 professional qualities and integrity. Operators remained subject to continued checks and monitoring by the competent Maltese regulatory authorities.443 However, the Court of Justice held:\nIt must be recalled in this respect that no duty of mutual recognition of authorisations [\u2026] can exist in the current state of European Union law [\u2026]. The various Member States do not necessarily have the same technical means available for controlling online games of chance, and do not necessarily make the same choices in this respect. [\u2026] the fact that a particular level of protection of consumers against fraud by an operator may be achieved in a particular Member State by applying sophisticated control and monitoring techniques does not permit of the conclusion that the same level of protection can be achieved in other Member States which do not have those technical means available or have made different choices. A Member State may legitimately wish, moreover, to monitor an economic activity which is carried on in its territory, and that would be impossible if it had to rely on checks done by the authorities of another Member State using regulatory systems which it itself does not grasp. Consequently, the case-law relied on by Mr Dickinger and Mr \u00d6mer and the Maltese Government [\u2026] does not apply, in the present state of development of European Union law, in a field such as that of games of chance, which is not harmonised at European Union level, and in which the Member States have a wide discretion in relation to the objectives they wish to pursue and the level of protection they seek.444\n\n",

In Engelmann, it stated that, in spite of the lack of applicable secondary law, the obligation of transparency fully applied in relation to gambling licenses or concessions:\nthe public authorities which grant such concessions are none the less bound to comply with the fundamental rules of the Treaties, in particular Articles [49 TFEU] and [56 TFEU], and with the consequent obligation of transparency [\u2026]. Without necessarily implying an obligation to call for tenders, that obligation of transparency, which applies when the service concession in question may be of interest to an undertaking located in a Member State other than that in which the concession is granted, requires the concession-granting authority to ensure, for the benefit of any potential tenderer, a degree of publicity sufficient to enable the service concession to be opened up to competition and the impartiality of the award procedures to be reviewed [\u2026]. The grant of a concession, in the absence of any transparency, to an operator located in the Member State of the awarding authority constitutes a difference in treatment to the detriment of operators located in other Member States, who have no real possibility of manifesting their interest in obtaining the concession in question. Such a difference in treatment is contrary to the principle of equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality, and constitutes indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality prohibited by Articles [49 TFEU] and [56 TFEU], unless it is justified by objective circumstances [\u2026]. The fact that the issue of licences to operate gaming establishments may not be the same as a service concession contract does not, in itself, justify any failure to have regard to the requirements arising from Article [56 TFEU], in particular the principle of equal treatment and the obligation of transparency [\u2026]. Indeed, the obligation of transparency amounts to a condition which must be met before a Member State can exercise its right to award licences to operate gaming establishments, irrespective of the method of selecting operators, because the effects of the award of such licences on undertakings which are established in other Member States and potentially interested in engaging in that activity are the same as those of a service concession contract.463\n\n",

Some disordered gamblers experience problems resisting the trigger in the form of advertising. Adolescents were found to be particularly receptive of (gambling) advertising and counter-advertising, which shaped their views on the positive and negative sides of gambling. There is similar empirical evidence from other fields like tobacco and alcohol advertising. What seems to matter is that consumers receive a balanced picture of the chances and risks of gambling.

By contrast, there were also a few jurisdictions in which a number of courts referred to concrete criteria in their proportionality analysis: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.606 In particular, only Austrian and German courts found it important to inquire into alternative measures that would be less restrictive to intra-Union trade while still being equally effective.607 Not least because of their historical experience with totalitarian regimes, the German and Austrian legal systems provide for courts that are expected to closely review government decisions.

It was suggested in the literature that Norwegian courts proceed to a proportionality review when dealing with EEA law (and ECHR law) but may often incorrectly apply the proportionality test, that is, not in line with the review criteria of the European High Courts.615 The earlier mentioned empirical study seems to support the view of a very lenient judicial review.616 It was further argued that UK courts effectively apply a proportionality review on substance \u2013 in spite of also using language reminiscent of common law, particularly relating to the Wednesbury test.617 However, final conclusions on this topic would require a close analysis of a significant number of cases from these jurisdictions.",

The moral perspective led to a lack of a science-informed approach towards games of chance and gambling addiction. Some of the Court of Justice\u2019s remarks in Gambelli and Lindman could have served as a basis for developing a science-oriented jurisprudence but remained rather isolated statements as further case law showed.",

Underlining the wide margin of appreciation, the Court of Justice demonstrated reluctance in offering substantial guidance to national courts and emphasised the role of national courts in the judicial review of national gambling policies. A study had found that national courts often did not review the proportionality of restrictive measures in gambling, regularly limiting their \u2018assessment\u2019 to a mere reference to formula of the Court of Justice.

While numerous courts in Austria and Germany assessed measures that would be less restrictive to intra-Union trade, courts in Scandinavian countries regularly made simply a global reference to the principle of proportionality or formula of the Court of Justice. As illustrated along the examples of Denmark and Norway, the reluctance may often not be due to a lack of judicial powers but rather due to judicial traditions. It was for instance shown that the Danish Supreme Court (\u2018H\u00f8jesteret\u2019) hardly ever struck down a national law based on unconstitutionality and that the Norwegian courts traditionally only applied a reasonableness test rather than a proportionality test.",
