Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and Filter binding assay have been widely used to study protein-nucleic acid interaction in the last 30 years [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, these two methods require labeling of fluorescent probes or isotope elements on nucleic acids to provide signals for quantitative molecule detection. Thus, the cost for these methods is high, and the labeling may alter the binding affinity of molecules. To develop an efficient and molecule-labeling free binding assay with low cost and high sensitivity becomes a very important issue.",

Phosphate buffered saline (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) was initially dropped on the sensor. There was no net current change until the target protein concentration of 0.003nM of the protein was added. A clear current change was observed as the system reached a steady state. Real-time current monitoring spanned the range of protein concentrations from 0.003 nM to 3000 nM, and showed saturation as the concentration of SARS-CoV CTD larger than 300 nM. ",

The amount of SARS-CoV CTDs in 0.003 nM was about 0.4 pg. This result showed the sensitivity of ours system could compete with isotopelabeling EMSA. The usage of protein sample was significantly low, and the amount of SARS-CoV CTDs in once experiment was about 400 ng. Moreover, the salt concentration in our experiment was 50 mM, and was 33 times larger than the salt concentration which used in AMPs immobilized nanowire FET system 19 . Thus, our system was approach to physiological condition, and more suitable for biological application.",
