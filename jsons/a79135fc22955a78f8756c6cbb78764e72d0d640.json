However, the incidence of VAP among patients with TBI reported in studies varies widely. What is more, the risk factors and outcomes of VAP are controversial. This study estimates the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of VAP in patients with TBI and provides evidence for prevention and treatment. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched from the earliest records to May 2018. Data involving the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes were extracted for meta-analysis. The results showed that the incidence of VAP was 36% (95% confidence interval (CI) 31-41%); risk factors analyses showed that smoking [odds ratio (OR) 2.13; 95% CI 1.16-3.92], tracheostomy (OR 9.55; 95% CI 3.24-28.17), blood transfusion on admission (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.24-5.18), barbiturate infusion (OR 3.52; 95% CI 1.68-7.40), injury severity score (OR 4.65; 95% CI 1.96-7.34), and head abbreviated injury scale (OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.66-5.37) were related to the occurrence of VAP. When patients developed VAP, mechanical ventilation time (OR 5.45; 95% CI 3.78-7.12), ICU length of stay (OR 6.85;, and hospital length of stay (OR 10.92; 95% CI 9.12-12.72) were significantly increased. However, VAP was not associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.74-2.21). VAP is common in patients with TBI. It is affected by a series of factors and has a poor prognosis.",

This meta-analysis showed that the incidence of VAP in patients with TBI was 36% (95% CI 31-41%) by pooling data from the included studies. However, the spectacular disparity in the incidence of VAP was shown in the previous studies. Bronchard et al. [23] and Jovanovic et al. [8] reported that the incidence of VAP was 50%, while Rinc\u00f3n-Ferrari et al. [9] found that the incidence of VAP was about 23%. Differences in the study design, region, definition of VAP, and the severity of TBI may explain this wide range, leading to subgroup analyses based on these factors. The result demonstrated that the incidence of VAP in prospective studies was significantly higher than retrospective studies (41% vs. 33%). A study performed by J Tobias et al. showed that data obtained retrospectively from the medical records were less complete and accurate compared to data obtained from the patients prospectively [31] . Retrospective information is fraught with the problems of missing data, conflicting data, and illegibility [32] . We recommend that more prospective studies be carried out in the future so as to obtain more rigorous results about VAP. In addition, there was a significant difference in the incidence of VAP between North America, Europe and Asia (39% vs. 40% vs. 28%) by subgroup analysis; this difference may be due to the lack of active infection monitoring systems in Asian countries compared to European and North American countries, which led to the inadequate feedback of hospital infection surveillance data and underestimate of the incidence of VAP [33] [34] [35] . What is more, the result showed that the incidences of VAP in severe TBI patients and all TBI patients were similar, with 35% and 39%, respectively. In this meta-analysis, three studies included all TBI patients, rather than only those with severe TBI [10, 14, 23] . Most of the patients in these three studies had severe neurologic injury. The mean GCS score of patients was 7.38 in the study conducted by Kallel et al. [14] , and 7.2 in the study conducted by Bronchard et al. [23] . The median GCS score of patients was 6 in the study conducted by Leone et al. [10] . This may explain why the incidence of VAP in these three studies is similar to the studies including patients with severe TBI. Additionally, as for EOVAP and LOVAP, the incidence of EOVAP and LOVAP is related to the cutoff point used for definition [36] . However, the cutoff point in the literature is usually inconsistent [37] . Unifying EOVAP and LOVAP cutoff point is of great significance to the treatment of patients and clinical research. Further research is needed to accurately assess the cutoff point.",

            "text": "Identification of risk factors associated with VAP could permit clinical staff to provide close infection surveillance and timely care for TBI patients at high risk for pneumonia so as to optimize clinical outcomes. In the present meta-analysis, we integrated all eligible studies of VAP in patients with TBI. By integrating the results of previous studies and expanding the sample size, we found a significant relationship between VAP and the following risk factors: smoking, tracheostomy, blood transfusion on admission, barbiturate infusion, ISS, and head AIS. We identified that smoking increased the risk for VAP, probably because smoking impairs mucociliary clearance, making it easier for pathogens to colonize in the respiratory tract [38] . Smoking remains an important contributor to pneumonia, and all patients with TBI should be encouraged to quit. Additionally, tracheotomy increased the risk for VAP; tracheotomy bypasses normal respiratory defense mechanisms, such as oropharynx and cilia, which contribute to the occurrence of VAP [39] . It has been reported that use of suction-above-the-cuff tracheotomy tubes reduces the incidence of VAP [40] . More attention in the details of tracheotomy care such as the use of suction-above-thecuff tracheotomy tubes [40] may be helpful in decreasing the associated risk when tracheotomy is performed. Furthermore, blood transfusion on admission heightens the risk for VAP, which may be because the early period of acute severe trauma is associated with an immunosuppressive inflammatory response, and this response was increased in magnitude when patients received a transfusion of blood products [41, 42] . In addition, our results showed that barbiturate use increased the risk of VAP in TBI patients, which may be related to the immunosuppressive effect of barbiturates given they; promote reversible bone marrow suppression in patients with TBI [43] and increased susceptibility to develop VAP [27] . Although some treatments such as the use of barbiturates or blood transfusions are frequently indicated, they should be administered appropriately. Moreover, the result of this meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with higher ISS or head AIS represent a specific target population for the prevention of VAP. The AIS provides a method for ranking and comparing injuries by severity in body regions [44] . The ISS is derived from the AIS and provides a description of the overall severity of injury for patients with trauma [17] . A study by Teixeira Lopes et al. [45] analyzed the risk factors associated with post-traumatic complications in hospitalized trauma patients. The study revealed that the higher the severity of trauma, the greater the number of hospitalization complications. Furthermore, the main complications presented by trauma patients were infections, especially VAP and sepsis [45, 46] . The results suggest that ISS and AIS should be considered in therapeutic decisions to help healthcare providers properly identify patients at high risk for VAP and modify patient care to minimize the risk of VAP. VAP should be closely monitored to detect infections in the target population early and to take measures to achieve optimal results.",

Nevertheless, they suggested that antibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely used in clinical practice because antibiotic prophylaxis has no effect on length of stay and mortality. In addition, a study by Hoth et al. [48] showed that trauma patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis showed an increase in multi-drug-resistant bacteria.

Josephson's [50] study also showed that VAP does not lead to increased mortality in patients with neurovascular diseases, and he pointed out that death in patients with VAP was due mainly to neurologic injury and withdrawal of care. Additionally, VAP increased the mechanical ventilation time and prolonged the ICU length of stay and hospital length of stay. This is in agreement with the findings of many studies [51, 52] , indicating that VAP imposed a great burden on patients [52] .",

In addition, the cutoff points used to define EOVAP and LOVAP in the included studies were inconsistent. For example, some studies defined that VAP occurring in the first 4 days after mechanical ventilation was EOVAP [9] , while some studies defined that VAP occurring in the first 7 days after mechanical ventilation was EOVAP [23] . We recommend that more research about EOVAP and LOVAP be conducted in the future, so as to get more accurate knowledge about it.
