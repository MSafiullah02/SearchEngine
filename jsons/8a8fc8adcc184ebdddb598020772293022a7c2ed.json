Despite this call for social distancing pattern, there have been around 728 Indians have faced death and nearly 23,000 Indians have got infected [1] . During this lockdown the social structure was majorly disrupted by a single source event which has been attributed to the attendees of the congregation held at the Markaz Nizamuddin mosque in New Delhi. This congregation was held in the middle of March and subsequent country wide movement its attendees have resulted in disrupting the social distancing pattern of India as acknowledged in the press briefing by the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.

This concerned the prediction of number of COVID-19 cases after the initial lockdown was lifted. They computed the basic reproductive ratio R0 and its time-dependent generalization based on case data, age distribution and social contact structure were also computed by them. They concluded then that the three-week lockdown (from March 24, 2020 -April 14, 2020) was insufficient to prevent resurgence. They suggested protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation besides predicting measures in reducing agestructured morbidity and mortality. One of the major drawbacks of their approach is that they have arbitrarily assumed the parameters in their model. Its another matter that their predictions for the number of COVID-19 cases for the middle of April is diametrically opposite to the reality.",

Given that the incubation period of this virus, that is the number of days between contracting the virus and showing symptoms, is around 6 days. It was only after the 1 st April 2020 that news about this single source event started emerging and they were traced and tested which is caused a sudden spike in the number of infected cases in our country. This clearly shows that the attendees of the congregation were not tested in the first week of the lock-down 1.0 lest the number would have spiked early on, between March 23 and 30. In figure 1 we depict the ratio between the number of infected cases and the number of tests conducted. There are two trends shown in the figure. The blue trend line is the ratio taken for individual days and the orange trend line is ratio of the cumulative numbers. This ratio of new cases to total test, although too simplistic, yet indicates the need for more tests to be carried out if the ratio appears constant or increases over a period of time. In case this ratio trend line has even a light negative slope, it gives an early indication on the containment of the virus. From the figure we see that in both the trend lines, there is a significant spike in the first week of April, precisely on April 01 and 02, 2020. This is an early indication about the disruption in the social contact pattern.",

Any change in this reflects the disruption in the social contact structure as well. \u03b2 values presented in Figure 6 are learnt from a week long data. Lower value of beta directly corresponds to lower number of positively infected cases and vice versa. We see that the beta value spiked up to 0.3031 in the first week of April, owing to the Markaz event . Subsequently, owing to the restricted social contacting pattern through lock-down the value of beta then dropped to 0.2526.

Given this disruption of the social contact structure, the model shows that the country wide lockdown has been effective in bringing down the number of cases in India.",
