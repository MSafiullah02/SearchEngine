The virus, identified as the causative agent for a cluster of pneumonia cases initially detected in Wuhan City, China, in late 2019, was isolated and its sequence made available on January 7 and 12, 2020, respectively [2]. Phylogenetic data implicate a zoonotic origin of the virus, which is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013like coronaviruses, but more distant from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV [3]. The study of community transmission and family clusters of the disease, as well as the rapid spread of infection across the world, has soon provided key insights to support the existence of person-to-person transmission [4].",

Current estimates of COVID-19\u2019s case fatality rate suggest that the novel coronavirus is less deadly than the pathogens behind other large-scale outbreaks, such as of SARS, MERS, and Ebola. However, the infection seems to spread much faster than SARS, MERS, and seasonal influenza [6]. The virus\u2019s basic reproduction number (R0)\u2014the number of people on average one infected person will pass the virus to\u2014is comparatively high, and WHO has published their estimation of R0 to be 2.0\u20132.5 using early information.",

Indirect contact via contaminated surfaces is another likely cause of infection [9]. Latest research also shows that airborne transmission is possible because the virus is stable for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 was detectable, albeit at progressively lower titers, in aerosols for up to 3 h, up to 4 h on copper, up to 24 h on cardboard, and up to 2 to 3 days on stainless steel and plastic, respectively [10].

ACE2+ epithelial cells of salivary gland ducts were demonstrated to be early targets of SARS-CoV infection [14], and SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have the same tropism for the salivary epithelium; this may be a possible explanation for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in secretory saliva. Viral carriage in salivary fluids is a key, additional risk factor for aerosol-generating procedures that routinely take place in dental practice.",

The reduction of bacterial contamination of the atmosphere, perioperatively, is greatest at 1 m from the headrest; therefore, the use of rubber dam would minimize significantly the inhalation of infective aerosols by dental personnel. Conversely, more recent evidence suggests that use of rubber dam results in significantly higher aerosol levels on various areas of the dentist\u2019s head [30]. Although in this latter case the aerosol generated is likely to contain less viral particles, overall these data strongly suggest that dentists are required to cover their heads with suitable protective wear.",

Infection control precautions were introduced largely because of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and were designed and updated to prevent transmission of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other bloodborne diseases [33]. These standard precautions are designed to protect healthcare personnel and patients from pathogens that can be spread by blood or any other body fluid, excretion or secretion [22]. Elements of standard precautions include (1) hand hygiene; (2) use of personal protective equipment (PPE, e.g., gloves, masks, eyewear); (3) respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette; (4) sharps safety (engineering and work practice controls); (5) safe injection practices (i.e., aseptic technique for parenteral medications); (6) sterile instruments and devices; and (7) clean and disinfected environmental surfaces [22]. According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA), standard precautions during patient care is determined by the task being performed and the type of exposure that is anticipated, not by the patient. For example, only gloves may be needed when obtaining dental radiographs, whereas protective eyewear and clothing, gloves, and masks are necessary when placing restorations [31]. Standard precautions that apply to most dental procedures, including oral examination, are the use of PPE such as surgical mask, goggles/eye protection or face shield, gown or protective clothing, gloves, and head cap. Oral healthcare professionals should perform hand hygiene before putting on and after removing PPE, including gloves. Any reusable PPE and equipment must be properly cleaned, decontaminated or sterilized, and maintained after and between uses [34]. Standard precautions are routine infection control practices and should be in place in dental clinics at all times.",

Hence, a second level of precautions, referred to as transmission-based precautions, need to be implemented and are always used in addition to standard precautions. There are three categories of transmission-based precautions: airborne, droplet, and contact [35], and these also apply to other respiratory viruses (Table 4). Notable additions to standard precautions include the utilization of particulate respirators by dentists and chairside assistants (e.g., N-95 masks authenticated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health or FFP2/3-standard masks set by the European Union) and use of high-volume evacuation (HVE) or systems that improve the general ventilation and effectively control the airflow patterns and filtration of the circulating air. In dental offices in which these airborne precautions cannot be implemented, having the patient wear a mask at any time when outside the operative room, placing the patient in a private room distant from other patients, ensuring a level of room ventilation (e.g., frequent natural ventilation via windows, for example, 5-min air change between each patient), and avoiding the presence of unnecessary individuals in the room [31] will reduce the likelihood of transmission.",
