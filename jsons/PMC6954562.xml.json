Several studies have shown that HSV-1 reactivation and active replication in the respiratory tract are common in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients even without underlying immunosuppression, with reported rates of 5 to 64% [3]. Ong et al., in the largest study available to date, detected active HSV replication in 27% of 393 ventilated ICU patients, which was associated with a nearly twofold increase in hospital mortality (41% vs 24%, p = 0.002) [4].",

To date, only one study has suggested that acyclovir may reduce in-hospital and ICU mortality, even after correcting for confounders via propensity score matching [17]. The reasons for these conflicting results remain unclear; however, it is apparent that most of the previous studies examined HSV replication, corresponding treatment, and the impact on survival among a diverse range of ICU patients. Often, stringent inclusion criteria for presumed viral ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were not employed, and patients were not stratified for viral load. In fact, many patients with molecularly detectable HSV replication may not have clinical signs of pneumonia, precluding any conclusions regarding the therapeutic efficacy of acyclovir.",

Therefore, we changed our treatment algorithm for patients with VAP early in 2013. In patients with clinical signs of pneumonia who did not respond to antibiotic treatment (as determined in joint rounds by clinicians and experienced clinical microbiologists performed routinely three times per week), HSV-1/2 testing of respiratory specimens was performed. Antiviral treatment was strongly encouraged if more than 105 HSV copies/mL could be detected. However, final treatment decisions were left to the responsible physician. We hypothesized that these stringent selection criteria would result in a significantly more homogeneous patient population than in previous studies, with a higher pretreatment likelihood of HSV pneumonia, and would, for the first time, allow for direct evaluation of acyclovir treatment efficacy in these patients.",

We defined the time point of VAP diagnosis as the first radiological demonstration of pulmonary infiltrates. In those patients without clear-cut infiltrates, a diagnosis of VAP was made based on bronchoscopy findings. Neutropenic patients (neutrophils < 1500/\u03bcL) were excluded. Response to antibiotic treatment was assessed during regular daily ICU rounds, usually 48 h after initiation; responding patients were excluded from the analysis. Quantitative HSV-1/2 PCR was performed after automated DNA extraction by COBAS AmpliPrep (Roche) with the RealStar HSV-PCR kit 1.0 (AltonaDiagnostics) on a Rotor-Gene-Q thermocycler (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.

Although the patients receiving acyclovir treatment, like in our study, had longer ICU stays (55 vs 31 days), and, therefore, had longer risk exposure to other ICU-related complications, acyclovir treatment still was associated with longer survival. This suggests that the impact of acyclovir treatment on survival may be substantial if proper patient selection was performed.",

It should be kept in mind that this is a retrospective study of data acquired during routine clinical practice, so the decision to provide or withhold acyclovir treatment was left entirely to the responsible attending physician. In these patients, given the lack of evidence at that time, detection of HSV replication in the respiratory tract was not considered clinically significant by our clinical staff. To minimize selection bias, we determined a propensity score and added it to a multivariable Cox regression model (as shown in Additional file 1: Table S2), but the results remained essentially the same.",

However, we consider it highly likely, because all patients in the final analysis had signs of pneumonia, all other pulmonary pathogens detected were adequately treated by antibiotics, and no patient responded to antibiotic treatment. Additionally, the therapeutic effect of acyclovir suggests a causative role of HSV in high load patients. Unfortunately, there are no randomized trials examining acyclovir as a treatment for VAP. Only one randomized trial exists regarding prophylactic treatment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Acyclovir reduced HSV detection in viral culture, but did not reduce mortality [32].",

Timing may impact HSV detection, since HSV load may increase with the length of mechanical ventilation [33]. Thus, some of our low viral load patients may have been classified as high load patients if the PCR had been performed later. However, they all had clinical signs of pneumonia at the time of sampling. Moreover, we found no correlation between time from VAP diagnosis to HSV detection and viral load (Additional file 1: Figure S1). This suggests that viral loads may not rapidly increase during several days. Therefore, we consider this time point as clinically adequate and suggest that a few days of variation in PCR diagnosis does not significantly alter the results.",
