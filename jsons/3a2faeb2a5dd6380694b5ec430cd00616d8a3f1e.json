A significant change in OC43 antibodies was recorded in 33 cases and a constant high titre, defined as a titre occurring in the respective age group in less than 1% of all sera examined, was found in 45 cases. On the basis of careful retrospective analysis of hospital case records it was concluded that in 28 cases with an increase of OC43 antibody titres, and in two with titre decrease, a disease could be associated with an acute coronavirus infection. In 16 cases the disease was dominated by respiratory symptoms. Eight of these patients, four children and four adults, had pneumonia. Three of the eight pneumonia patients had, however, another Concomitant infection, too. Four patients had neurological symptoms, one had severe perimyocarditis, and in five cases fever was the only symptom recorded. Among the patients with a statistically significant high titre of OC43 antibodies, there were 14 cases where a suggestive association with a disease could be envisaged on the basis of hospital records.

Lower respiratory tract infections have rarely been described. Coronavirus strain 229E was recovered from nasal washes of two children with acute phase pneumonia [McIntosh et al, 19741 .

Problems in diagnosing human coronavirus infections are well known, namely the failure of most strains to grow in regular cell cultures used for virus isolatioii as well as the technical difficulties in preparing sufficient amounts of antigen other than OC43 for routine serological screening. Hence it is probable that our understanding of the real clinical significance of human coronavirus infections is still limited and superficial. Indeed, electron microscopic studies have revealed coronavirus-like particles in patient tissues or secretions in a variety of nonrespiratory disorders of man, such as acute hepatitis [Holmes et al, 19701, chronic active hepatitis [Zuckerman et al, 19701, endemic nephritis [Apostolov et al, 19751 , acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis [Caul and Clarke, 197.51 , and lymphatic neoplasia [Arnold, 19781.
