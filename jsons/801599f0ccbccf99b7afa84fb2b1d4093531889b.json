When policy makers around the world realized the threat of COVID-19, they began crafting guidance, and eventually started issuing stay-at-home orders. These orders have created significant economic disruption, and disruption to peoples' lives. And there has been a question of how long they can be maintained. Already, lock-down orders are being lifted, at least in part, in some locations. But the question remains of what to do next, both in terms of dealing with the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and handling any future outbreaks of this nature.",

However, these lockdown orders cannot be maintained indefinitely. One has to wonder how a premature end to a lockdown might impact the spread of the infection, and if there are any alternatives to such measures, and whether they might be more effective. This paper has two goals. The first goal is to compare a number of modified SEIR models, in order to identify possible outcomes associated with the current lockdown efforts. The second goal is to identify potential ways to improve efforts to reduce the spread of both SARS-CoV-2, and infectious disease overall. The models in this paper rely on empirically estimated parameters, and take into account a number of factors, including social distancing, stratification of risk groups and hospital capacity. It then compares models in which a constant level of social distancing for a fixed period of time with modulated social distancing based on voluntary activity informed by disease surveillance.",

The analysis also suggests that every contact is almost guaranteed to result in an infection: \u03b2 \u2248 1. Because the model used in Peng et al. 2020 was complicated and did not calculate the unaided clearing of the infection, approximations from another source were used. D'Arienzo and Coniglio 2020 suggest that even in Italy where there is a significant COVID-19 burden, the basic reproduction number is between 2.43 and 3.10, which yields a range of 0.32 and 0.41 and for \u03b3 [3] .",

The minimum estimated mortality rate, for the entire progression of the epidemic was approximately 0.0062 or 620 per 100,000.

Each time step represents 0.1 days. At the start of the outbreak, there is a significant reduction in infections and deaths, but there is a spike in both shortly after the end of the social distancing effort. Rather than flattening the curve, the more extreme social distancing measures appear to delay the peak, allowing \"pressure\" to build up due to a high reserve of susceptible individuals.
