Crystal structures of human and bacterial FAN1 bound to a DNA flap have been solved. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial FAN1 and human FAN1 (hFAN1) missing a flexible loop are monomeric, while intact hFAN1 is homo-dimeric in structure. Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 exhibit very different DNA binding modes. Here, we interrogate the functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 and provide an explanation for the discrepancy in oligomeric state between the two hFAN1 structures. Specifically, we show that the flexible loop in question is needed for hFAN1 dimerization. While monomeric and dimeric bacterial or human FAN1 proteins cleave a short 5' flap strand with similar efficiency, optimal cleavage of a long 5' flap strand is contingent upon protein dimerization. Our study therefore furnishes biochemical evidence for a role of hFAN1 homodimerization in biological processes that involve 5' DNA Flap cleavage. Fig. 1. Dimerization of FAN1 upon DNA binding. (A) Previously solved crystal structures of WT hFAN1 [9], hFAN1 with residues 510-518 deleted (\u0394L hFAN1) [10], and Pseudomonas aeruginosa FAN1 [11] are compared, with the catalytic site aspartate highlighted in red. The catalytic VRR-nuc domain and the DNA binding SAP domain are labeled in bold for all FAN1 molecules. (B) Zoomed-in view of the dimerization interface of WT hFAN1, formed by the VRR-nuc domain of one monomer (grey) and the SAP domain of the 2 nd monomer (teal).

Surprisingly, the two available structures of the hFAN1 differ both in the oligomerization state (dimer vs monomer) and DNA-binding mode. The dimeric structure has an interface with DNA that spans both hFAN1 protomers [9] , while the monomeric hFAN1 structure largely resembles the crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa FAN1 (PaFAN1) bound to DNA [10, 11] (Fig. 1A, right panel) . It is unclear whether the two hFAN1 crystal structures capture physiologically relevant oligomeric states of this enzyme in different substrate engagement/cleavage modes.",

However, as the 5' overhang length was increased to 15 nt and then to 40 nt (Fig. 2C, D) , the cleavage efficiency diminished significantly for both WT and \u0394L, albeit the activity drop on the 40-nt flap was much more pronounced for \u0394L than for WT. These initial assays were performed using the UBZ domain-deleted (\u0394UBZ) version of WT and \u2206L hFAN1, as the overall purification yield of the \u0394UBZ variant of these proteins was significantly higher than that of full-length hFAN1. To determine whether the UBZ domain exerts any influence on the flap nuclease activity of FAN1, we also expressed and purified full-length WT and \u2206L FAN1 proteins and tested them on the same flap substrates (Fig. 2E-F) . The results confirmed that while the \u2206L mutant is just as capable as the WT counterpart in cleaving the 1-nt flap, the latter is much more active on the 40-nt flap than the mutant (Fig. 2E right panel) .

Intriguingly, these structures also raised the question about the relevant oligomeric state of FAN1 in human cells. In the present study, we provide data to clarify the major difference between dimeric and monomeric forms of FAN1 and to advance our understanding of the biological function of FAN1. Specifically, given the very different modes of DNA binding in the two hFAN1 structures, we predicted that a difference should manifest in DNA cleavage as well. Through testing a series of 5' flap DNA substrates, we found that as the ssDNA overhang length increases, the efficiency of cleavage by FAN1 is reduced and that this reduction is significantly more dramatic for the monomeric form of hFAN1 (Fig. 4A) . To ascribe this activity difference to the oligomeric status difference of the protein, we also examined bacterial FAN1 orthologs that are either dimeric or monomeric. Importantly, by comparing the dimeric VvFAN1 and the monomeric PaFAN1 in the same nuclease tests, we have provided further evidence that the oligomeric status of FAN1 determines its efficiency in cleaving a long ssDNA flap strand.",

Our crystal structures of dimeric hFAN1 have provided evidence for \"scanning\", \"latching\" and \"unwinding\" modes of DNA engagement stemming from the concerted effort of two FAN1 protomers [9] (Fig. 4B) . We note that the VRR-nuc domains form a dimeric structure that can cleave the Holliday Junction in a symmetric fashion, but due to the insertion of a helix in the VRRnuc domain of FAN1, the inherent dimerization property becomes impaired [12] . In this regard, certain FAN1 orthologs, particularly the human and Vibrio enzymes, have evolved another surface for protein dimerization where the SAP domain of one protomer associates with the VRR-nuc domain of a second protomer to generate an asymmetric dimer. This asymmetry underlies the ability of hFAN1 to cleave a long 5' flap strand. Thus, protein dimerization likely imparts plasticity to hFAN1 in the processing of damaged replication forks.",
