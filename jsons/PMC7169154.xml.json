In 1900, viruses were an unopened book with no direct evidence of their existence. Now, however, it is possible to read a virus genome from beginning to end, and with next generation sequencing (NGS) it is possible to do so almost instantaneously. At the same time, virological diagnosis has become more precise, and the immunological memory of virus infections has been made sharper than ever. Suppression and cure of virus infections is beginning to be realised, spread of important viral pathogens is being interrupted, and the eradication of a few of them has largely been realised if not universally so.",

The academic virologist must therefore regard clinical and public health advocacy as at least as important as dwelling upon his/her particular loci of research, and they must offer their students a broad grasp of the ecology of virus infections. For almost all of their students this will be more important than the minutiae of virus genomics. The students of today are the clinical decision\u2010takers of tomorrow, and they need to understand the interface between virus pathogens and humans.",

Each could be said to represent an experiential failure in the teaching of virology as it applies to clinical medicine and public health. An egregious example was the acceptance for publication in 1998 of a paper about the supposed consequences for 12 children in the aftermath of their MMR vaccination. That single article has done untold damage to world immunisation schedules which shows little sign of abating. When this outcome was analysed in\u2010depth in 20101 a basic question had not, even by then, been answered satisfactorily, that is, \u2018How was an ambitious clinical researcher's urge to publish allowed to override proper caution when the claims made were so implausible?\u2019 Attenuated vaccine strains, from Jenner's vaccinia and Theiler's 17D yellow fever vaccine through to MMR should not have been expected to cause complications never seen in the equivalent wild infections unless there was much firmer evidence.",

UK Departments of Health proposed that tamiflu should be prescribed to influenza\u2010vulnerable groups as a prophylactic on a continuing basis. This was an expensive error due to the failure to give a strong and specific indication for its use. An antiviral for influenza is only likely to be effective if part of very timely treatment, or prophylactically as soon as an exposure is recognised.",

The case both for using NGS to make a faster choice of a new vaccine strain, and for novel approaches to vaccine production, is undeniable. Influenza A remains the most likely pandemic threat of all. More resources need to be dedicated to making a better vaccine and more timely vaccination, and more persuasive tactics need to be found in support of vaccine acceptance.",

One is the speed and scale with which viruses propagate themselves, and the implications for onward transmission of viral pathogens, whether \u201chorizontally\u201d or from mother to child. For example, hepatitis B carriers can have a blood virus burden of ten orders of magnitude per millilitre, that is, a hundred million virions. Even for those viruses that the immune response quickly suppresses viraemia may transiently be superabundant, and it is then that most transmissions will occur. It would also be helpful to more narrowly define the incubation periods of virus infections avoiding making them impractically wide, as well as identifying when infectiousness is likely to be greatest.",

These have, for instance, opened up opportunities to interrupt the spread of HIV.2 In England and Wales, reported incidence of HIV has almost quartered since 2012,3 mostly due to the use of pre\u2010exposure prophylaxis. For the otherwise mortal Ebola infection, antiviral combinations and vaccine have made intensive care and treatment a realistic approach even in the poorly resourced and politically uncertain environments where that virus has recently been, or still is, active.4, 5\n",

The expansion of the mega\u2010cities of South and South\u2010East Asia, Africa, and South America is bringing humans and the species that we may share virus susceptibilities with into close contact. This is the likely explanation for several recent outbreaks of coronavirus and coronavirus\u2010like respiratory infections in humans such as SARS, MERS, and Nipah viruses, and for the current 2019nCoV epidemic: all are examples of what may happen at the interface between humans, animals, and, in the case of influenza A, birds when they come into intimate contact. A previous editorial in this journal compared the origin of SARS with that of MERS.7 As this editorial is being drafted, Chinese authorities and international bodies are grappling with the spread of 2019nCoV, an animal coronavirus which appears to have acquired a greater capacity to transmit between humans than either of them. It is about to be seen whether China, a country uniquely able to impose self\u2010quarantine on its population, can interrupt the national spread of 2019nCoV infection.",
