            "text": "Methods for characterization of the intestinal microbiota are based on cultivation techniques or molecular tools (Fig. 2-1\n). The selection of the best approach depends on the study problem (e.g., detection of specific pathogens in clinical specimens, or general characterization of the intestinal ecosystem), the cost, and the availability of technologies. Each method has strengths but also limitations (outlined below). For general ecologic surveys of microbial communities, molecular high-throughput sequencing techniques yield the most information as they allow in-depth identification of microorganisms. For screening of specific pathogens, culture techniques and species specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays may be most useful. Both of these methods are sensitive to sample handling and processing. Detailed instructions for sample collection and shipping for each particular assay should be acquired before sample submission as many laboratories use their own in-house culture or PCR assays. In the case of molecular methods, there is usually no standardization of DNA extraction or PCR protocols among laboratories, and such factors impact on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. Improper DNA extraction, especially from fecal samples, may result in the presence of residual PCR inhibitors that cause false negative results. Because of the high sensitivity of PCR assays (theoretically a single target copy can be amplified), any DNA contamination can lead to false-positive results. A laboratory should be chosen that has expertise in molecular analysis, and that has validated each assay in the target specimen.",

            "text": "Several limitations are associated with culture methods, especially if they are used to survey for the presence of unknown microorganisms in intestinal samples. Bacterial culture underestimates total bacterial numbers in the intestine, as microscopic counts (especially when using fluorescent dyes) are typically higher than the total viable counts obtained from culture. Although the majority of intestinal bacteria cannot be cultured, this does not necessarily mean that they are uncultivable, but rather, that insufficient information is currently available about their optimal growth requirements. Furthermore, many microbes depend on mutualistic interactions with other bacteria and the host, hindering their successful isolation in vitro. While recent advances have increased the cultivable fraction,3 it is estimated that less than 10% of intestinal bacteria can be cultured, and an even smaller fraction can be correctly classified. Therefore studies of the intestinal ecosystem may exhibit bias toward the minor cultivable portion of the gut microbiota. The analytical sensitivity of bacterial culture depends on the organism and its growth requirements. Bacterial culture is associated with difficulties in handling, storing, and shipping of clinical specimens. Ideally, samples should be processed immediately to preserve anaerobic species. Many selective culture media lack sufficient specificity, and often organisms other than the target are enumerated.4 Phenotypic and biochemical identification systems often fail to accurately classify many microorganisms, requiring DNA sequencing of isolates.",

            "text": "Molecular fingerprinting techniques are used for simultaneous analysis and comparison of microbial communities in multiple samples. These techniques provide information on microbial changes over time and in response to treatment. Available techniques include denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The goal is to separate the mixture of PCR amplicons that were generated with broad range primers (universal or group specific) to yield a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the bacterial community. This is achieved as each bacterial phylotype has a unique nucleotide composition (i.e., guanine+cytosine content). These differences in nucleotide composition result in unique melting behaviors of PCR amplicons. Each PCR amplicon reaches a specific melting point in a different position in a polyacrylamide gel, where it will denature and slow its migration. This banding pattern illustrates the bacterial diversity in the sample (Fig. 2-2\n). In DGGE, a gel containing a linear gradient of DNA denaturants is used, whereas in TGGE a temperature gradient is used for separation. Bands of interest can be excised and sequenced. DGGE and TGGE are inexpensive and rapidly performed. However, because DGGE/TGGE bands are usually short, only limited resolution of PCR amplicons can be achieved, and many bacterial phylotypes will have similar or the same melting behaviors. Therefore, these techniques yield typically only 20 to 40 bands, capturing only changes in the predominant bacterial groups. The use of T-RFLP allows profiling, but also quantification of microbial communities. Bacteria are amplified in PCR assays containing a fluorescent labeled primer. The PCR products are then fragmented by size with sequence specific restriction enzymes. The fragments are separated by capillary electrophoresis with subsequent quantitative measurement of the fluorescence.",

For identification of individual bacterial phylotypes, PCR amplicons must be separated and sequenced. A commonly used method is the construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries.6, 7, 10 The PCR amplicons are separated by ligation into plasmid vectors with subsequent transformation into Escherichia coli cells. These cells are plated on culture medium and grown overnight. Each cell forms a colony containing one plasmid with the original amplified 16S rRNA gene sequence. This plasmid can then be purified and sequenced. Although this approach is informative, it is laborious and not well suited for analysis of large sample numbers. Recently, new high-throughput sequencing platforms have been introduced that allow automated separation of PCR amplicons without the need for subcloning. These platforms (e.g., 454-pyrosequencing, Illumina) allow several thousand sequences to be analyzed within a few hours, yielding a deep coverage of the microbiota.2, 11 However, because of the high bacterial diversity in the intestine, groups of low abundance (especially pathogens of interest) may constitute such a low proportion of the total bacteria, that they still escape identification. Therefore, for the detection of particular groups of interest (i.e., Bifidobacterium spp.), the use of group specific PCR primers is recommended.",

The reduction of hydrogen promotes an environment that favors the growth of polysaccharide fermenting bacteria, leading to a higher energy utilization of the diet.

Passing microbes (i.e., swallowed) are present only transiently in the GI tract. Within hours after birth, the sterile intestine becomes colonized by bacteria present in the birth canal, milk, and surrounding environment.34 Shifts in relative proportions of bacteria occur during postnatal development. In one study, bacterial counts in the small intestine were highest in one-day-old puppies and decreased significantly thereafter. They remained stable at approximately 107 CFU/g over the observation period of 42 days.34 Aerobes predominate in the first weeks of life, but the proportion of anaerobes gradually increases with age, mostly because of an increase in Bacteroidetes. The major shifts in microbial populations correlate with dietary changes (i.e., suckling and transition to solid food) and the physiologic development of the host's ability to metabolize dietary substrates (e.g., development of intestinal brush-border enzymes) in the first weeks after birth.34, 35 The microbiota increases in diversity in the first few months of life and remains remarkably stable during adulthood. More pronounced changes are observed in older animals (i.e., dogs older than 11 years), especially in the large intestine.20 These changes are most likely caused by the changing structure and function of the GI tract with increasing age. Older dogs have more Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus spp., and fewer Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus spp.20 DGGE fingerprinting profiles also cluster according to age, and levels of Bacteroides are significantly lower in older dogs.33\n",

Intestinal motility is an important regulator of bacterial counts in the intestine, as microbes that are not able to adhere to the epithelium will be quickly eliminated. In contrast, higher numbers of bacteria are present in the large intestine as a consequence of stagnant flow of luminal content and the abundance of nutrients. The ileocolic valve together with normal intestinal motility prevents retrograde migration of bacteria from the large into the small intestine.36 Any changes in these control mechanisms may lead to alterations to community composition or total bacterial count. For example, atrophic gastritis or acid suppressant therapy leads to an increase in duodenal bacterial counts in man.37 Similarly, dogs with experimentally induced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) have increased bacterial number in the proximal small intestine.38 Anatomical malformations (e.g., strictures, surgically created blind loops) associated with altered motility are a common site of bacterial overgrowth in man.",

Animals can live well when raised under germ-free conditions. However, morphologic and immunologic differences between germ-free and conventionally raised animals suggest that that the commensal microbiota is a significant contributor to the development and maintenance of gut physiology and immune function.39 Germ-free animals have an altered mucosal architecture (i.e., thinner lamina propria) and reduced turnover of epithelial cells compared with conventionally raised animals.39 The underdeveloped immune system is rapidly restored upon introducing bacteria into germ-free mice.40 Bacteria communicate with the host via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and dendritic cells. The resident intestinal microbiota is a crucial part of the intestinal barrier that protects the host from invading pathogens. This mechanism is called colonization resistance. Proposed defenses include the competition for oxygen, nutrients, and mucosal adhesion sites, and the creation of a physiologically restrictive environment for nonresident bacterial species (e.g., secretion of antimicrobials, alterations in pH, and hydrogen sulfide production).41 Other crucial parts of the intestinal barrier are the intestinal epithelial cells, protective mucus, and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The increase in diversity of the colonizing microbiota at weaning strengthens the colonization resistance against pathogens. Furthermore, the resident microbiota drives maturation of the intestinal immune system. Younger animals with underdeveloped microbial diversity and immature GALT are dependent on protective colostral antibodies and milk components. Younger animals are typically more susceptible to invading pathogens (e.g., Campylobacter spp.). Studies of murine models have suggested that the pattern of microbial colonization in early life may impact on host physiology and colonizing resistance far into adulthood.42\n",

Clostridiaceae, Dorea spp., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus spp., Faecalibacterium spp., and Roseburia spp. are the predominant bacteria in the colon. The majority of colonic bacteria are anaerobic and their main functions are to produce energy from undigested food and to help in the competitive exclusion of potential pathogens. The slower flow of ingesta and the increased time and availability of nutrients favors microbial diversity in the colon. Bacteria within this ecosystem have developed cooperative strategies to transform the complexity of nutrients to their own and the host's benefit. Colonic bacteria provide digestive enzymes that allow utilization of complex carbohydrates. For example, 8% of the genome of Bifidobacterium longum is comprised of genes needed for carbohydrate metabolism.43 Microbes metabolize sloughed epithelial cells, endogenous mucus, and nondigested substrates that have passed through the small intestine. The latter are predominantly complex carbohydrates, including starch and dietary fiber such as cellulose, pectin, and inulin. The fermentation of these substrates results mainly in the production of short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetate, propionate, and butyrate) that provide energy for bacterial metabolism and for epithelial cell growth. Up to 7% of the metabolic energy of dogs, and to a lesser extent in cats, is produced by microbial fermentation.44 Peptides, amino acids, and intermediate products of microbial metabolism such as ethanol, lactic acid, and succinic acid are further metabolized into short-chain fatty acids. Some members of the Clostridium cluster XIVa also utilize lactate for butyrate production, thus preventing lactate accumulation in the human colon. However, colonic microbial metabolism of some substrates, mainly proteins, may also yield toxic intermediates with negative effects on epithelial cells.",

Colonization with transient pathogens, overgrowth of resident opportunistic commensals, or altered communication between the intestinal innate immune system and the commensal microbiota may result in GI disease. Invasion of specific pathogens (i.e., Salmonella, enterotoxigenic C. perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, and others) may profoundly disturb the structure of the GI mucosa. Enteric pathogens can penetrate into the submucosa and Peyer's patches, or produce exo- or enterotoxins that alter enterocyte function. Enterotoxins often stimulate mucosal fluid secretion, while villus effacement and loss of surface area diminishes mucosal absorptive capacity, resulting in diarrhea. Dysfunction of the mucosal barrier can lead to increased intestinal permeability and clinically significant bacterial translocation.47\n",

EPI is associated with an increase in bacterial counts in the canine small intestine, which often is reversible upon pancreatic enzyme supplementation.38 Such alterations may lead to various mechanisms that will negatively impact the function of the GI tract. Examples are an altered intestinal barrier with increased intestinal permeability, and direct damage to the intestinal brush-border and enterocytes leading to nutrient and vitamin malabsorption.

In murine models of IBD, inflammation develops only in the presence of bacteria. The cause\u2013effect relationship between microbial alterations and inflammation is not well determined. It is suspected that intestinal inflammation causes a shift toward Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Proteobacteria) that may perpetuate the disease in genetically susceptible individuals. New hypotheses also suggest that intestinal inflammation may trigger alterations in the immune system, which, in turn, diminish the colonization resistance of the resident microbiota, resulting in an overgrowth of pathogens.50 One current hypothesis implicates an abnormal interaction between commensal bacteria and the intestinal immune system in genetically predisposed individuals.51 For example, a subset of people with Crohn's disease may not be able to effectively clear commensal or pathogenic bacteria, resulting in overcompensating antibacterial effector T cells that may, in turn, cause tissue damage.51 People with Crohn's disease have a decrease in the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and an increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.1 In most studies of human IBD, a reduction in the diversity of Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium coccoides subgroups) was identified, suggesting that these bacterial groups, which are mainly producers of short-chain fatty acids, may play an important role in maintenance of GI health. Alterations in microbial composition have also been recently reported in dogs and cats with IBD.13, 49 Similar to people, dogs and cats with idiopathic IBD had significantly more Proteobacteria and reductions in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV in their duodenum compared with healthy animals.13, 49, 52 Boxer dogs with histiocytic ulcerative colitis respond to therapy with fluoroquinolones, and in this disease there is an association between the presence of adherent and invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) and inflammation.53 These AIEC isolates share similarities to those obtained from ileal tissues of people with Crohn's disease.53\n",

This observation emphasizes the need to distinguish the presence of beneficial clostridial groups from opportunistic commensals such as C. perfringens and Clostridium difficile. Changes in proposed beneficial bacterial groups such as Bifidobacterium spp. have also been observed in GI disease, although to a lesser extent. Modulating the intestinal microbial ecosystem is therefore a rational therapeutic approach in animals with GI disease. Clinical experience shows that dietary changes or antibiotic administration often leads to an improvement in GI signs. However, the exact mechanism remains elusive. Antibiotics can eliminate specific pathogens or can, as is also proposed for diets, lead to more general modulations of the intestinal microbiota. This potentially results in a reduced burden of stimulating antigens or the creation of an environment within the GI tract (e.g., changes in osmolarity and pH) that allows for more effective utilization of ingesta.",

            "text": "Because of vast interindividual differences in the intestinal microbiota, it is difficult to define what constitutes a normal and balanced intestinal ecosystem. Dietary manipulation, the administration of antibiotics or pre- and/or probiotics are commonly used modulating strategies. It is important to note that although such interventions may cause shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, these changes are largely individualized for each animal. Bacterial groups of a higher phylogenetic level (i.e., order or family) may show a synchronized response to the environmental influence, but these changes are rarely associated with one specific bacterial species or bacterial strain that is consistently altered in every individual. As a consequence of the complexity of the microbiota, the vast majority of bacterial groups within the ecosystem remain typically unaffected by diet or nutraceuticals.33, 54 This complicates the prediction as to which animal may benefit most from a selected strategy. Probiotics can lead to a transient increase in the administered target species, but this has an insignificant impact on the composition of the total microbial ecosystem. Furthermore, probiotics are typically eliminated from the intestine within a few days after ending administration. Therefore administration of high doses over prolonged periods of time is usually required. Prebiotics are typically complex carbohydrates that are added to diets to enhance the growth of endogenous microorganisms; including Bifidobacterium spp. Increases in bacterial groups that utilize these nutrients have been demonstrated.55 Such changes are again typically very minor within the entire ecosystem, as the administered prebiotics fulfill only some of the nutrient requirements for their target bacteria, but other essential nutrients remain at growth-limiting amounts. At this point, the significance of altering a rather minor proportion of the ecosystem remains unclear. It is also now well recognized that the microbiota is generally resilient to change and returns rapidly to its pretreatment state within a few days. Consequently, long-term modulation is needed to maintain a desired ecosystem. Antibiotic usage has a more pronounced effect and may disrupt the microbial ecosystem for prolonged periods of time (weeks to months). In one study evaluating the fecal microbiota of healthy people, approximately 30% of all bacterial taxa were affected, some of them for up to six months.11 Similarly, administration of tylosin for 14 days led to significant modifications in the jejunal microbiota of dogs, with some bacterial groups depressed for more than 14 days.2 However, highly individualized responses for some bacterial groups were observed in each animal.",
