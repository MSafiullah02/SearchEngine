We believe that the asymptomatic infectious cohort is an omitted part of the understanding of the epidemic dynamics of disease COVID-19. We introduce and derive the basic reproduction number as the weighted arithmetic mean of the basic reproduction numbers of the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts. Since the asymptomatic subjects people are not detected, they can spread the disease much longer, and this increases the COVID-19 R 0 up to around 9. We show that European epidemic outbreaks in various European countries correspond to the simulations with commonly used parameters based on clinical characteristics of the disease COVID-19, but R 0 is around three times bigger if the asymptomatic cohort is taken into account. Many voices in the academic world are drawing attention to the asymptomatic group of infectious subjects at present. We are convinced that the asymptomatic cohort plays a crucial role in the spread of the COVID-19 disease, and it has to be understood during government measures.",

Soon we realized, the simulation predicts outbreaks in European countries too late. The outbreaks fitted better for R 0 much higher than it is generally considered. Afterwards, serious outbreaks in Italy, Spain, UK, and the US happened very quickly. The paper [1] appeared in Science, estimating 86% of undocumented infectious (published 16.3.2020). Padova University recently informed about an experiment in town V\u00f2, where areal testing showed that the majority of the positive 3% of citizens were asymptomatic at the beginning of the outbreak. We made a hypothesis that the asymptomatic cohort can play a crucial role. This could also be a clue to understanding why early enough closing school policy contributes to slow down the outbreak. We propose a model that counts in with this asymptomatic infectious cohort, and we derive its basic reproduction number R 0 . We proved that the basic reproduction number is a weighted average of reproduction numbers of both the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts, which seems to be very intuitive. On the other hand, this implies that in case of a disease with the majority of asymptomatic cases, this basic reproduction number R 0 is much higher than the one gained from standard estimates based only on the symptomatic cohort. This can explain the \"invisible\" and fast increase in COVID-19 outbreaks since it also acts through the asymptomatic cohort. There are already studies that SEIAR model with asymptomatic cohort and consequences to efficiency of quarantine government measures in COVID-19 outbreak ",

Parameter \u03b2 can be modified by quarantine government measures that increase social distancing as closing schools, remote working, using masks, or similar. Parameter \u03b3 usually denotes the probability rate at which the Exposed subject develops clinically relevant symptoms. The period 1/\u03b3 (days \u22121 ) is called an incubation period. In the case of COVID-19, it is known that an Exposed subject is infectious one or two days before developing symptoms, and so we will define the Exposed compartment as a latent non-infectious compartment. Due to this, we assume that the period 1/\u03b3 is shorter than usually estimated (see [3] , [4] ). We assume that every Exposed subject becomes infectious, but subjects that enter I cohort later develop symptoms with probability p and those who not enter A cohort with probability 1 \u2212 p. This assumption is based on recent studies [1] and experiments in the Italian town V\u00f2. Parameters \u00b5 1 or \u00b5 2 , respectively, denote the remove rate, so 1 \u00b51 is the average period to isolation for Infected symptomatic subjects, and 1 \u00b52 is the average recovery period for Asymptomatic subjects. We assume that 1 \u00b52 > 1 \u00b51 , since the COVID-19 patients are treated or isolated very quickly after developing symptoms. We omit the probability rate of becoming susceptible again after recovery, although this is not evident (mainly for Asymptomatic subjects). We assume S + I + E + A + R = 1 (a non-dimensionalized model with a constant incidence rate).",

Commonly, 20% of symptomatic Infected subjects are hospitalized, and 10% need intensive care ( [9] ). That is 0.27% of the whole population. 60% decrease of \u03b2 (e.g., mask protection in the whole population) causes the peak to be halved in approximately doubled time.

Simulation-based on SEIAR showed good times of local epidemic outbreaks in Wu-Han, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, and others (with differences in days, Figure 3 ) and much closer proportion of infected in a population (difference in the order).

Air traffic and local traffic is not decreased, there is no decrease of R 0 due to government measures in Europe, so the simulation fails after 20/03/2020 (around a week after first measures). Real data are 10 times lower (that could be due to the lack of testing at the beginning of the outbreak and undetected mild symptomatic cases) and delayed 16 days (due to the incubation period, developing symptoms period and testing period, plus possible time for undetected first cases). Simulation for SEIR model with the same parameters (p = 1, R 0 = 3) moves the outbreak more than a month later, and the infected cohort is more than five times bigger.

The extremely rapid outbreaks in Italy and other countries, the functionality of only extreme measures, and the failure of measures that tried to protect and isolate only vulnerable groups are indirect supports for the suitability of the SEIAR model. Voices in the academic world are drawing attention to the asymptomatic group of infectious subjects.
