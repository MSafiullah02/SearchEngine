Moreover, prevention strategies for many health conditions may not be well known. For this reason, screening and surveillance are important strategies in managing population health in communities and in populations receiving health care services. Fundamental to the success of both screening and surveillance in terms of improving population health is knowledge of the natural history of the health problem and the ability to accurately detect the problem early.",

            "text": "Large scale community-based screening, such as sexually transmitted disease (STD) walk-in clinics, offers various free services, including confidential and/or anonymous testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In community-based screening, tests with high specificity and high sensitivity may yield large numbers of persons with false positive or false negative results. Test results are influenced by test-kit handling, storage conditions, clinic/laboratory quality assurance protocols, test inventory lot quality, test operator training and proficiency, external controls, and patient characteristics. Also, different testing methods for the same condition using different bodily fluids may yield different results. For example, OraQuick\u00ae oral fluid testing (OraSure Technologies, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) was found to have high false positive rates (or lower specificity) than finger-stick rapid testing whole-blood specimens for HIV. Out of 1,720 screened with oral fluid rapid testing, 343 false positive results occurred (Cummiskey et al., 2008). The efficacy of screening may also be mitigated by the strength of other risk factors acting upon intermediate steps in the causal pathway for a disease. Heavy cigarette smoking (\u226540 pack-years) is highly associated with carcinoma in situ (Terry et al., 2000). The persistence of intermediate risk factors (e.g., heavy cigarette smoking) for an intermediate step of a disease may diminish the time-window for detecting an early phase of the disease, such as the early detection of adenomas in heavy cigarette smokers.",

            "text": "Active surveillance is the systematic, active searching for all possible events in real time using routine prospective collection of information about specific health problems and their risk factors. Cases are identified from laboratory results, admissions records to hospitals or emergency departments, radiology reports, outpatient facilities, or doctor\u2019s office\u2019s logs or billing records of presenting complaints. Active surveillance involves the process of screening, namely, locating cases with signs and symptoms that meet well-defined criteria related to a diagnosis, or proxies of human cases. Active surveillance is directed at determining if changing risk factors or more toxigenic strains are emerging which may impact communities and health care settings and to attempt to prevent through rapid case identification the spread of \u00adtransmissible disease which has a high potential for serious illness or death such as Clostridium difficile or West Nile Virus (WVN) (Lindsey et al., 2008; Rabatsky-Ehr et al., 2008). Active surveillance for a condition similar to WNV involves collecting weekly information on the presence of this arbovirus in humans, animals, and mosquitos. Compiled data by state health departments are communicated to the CDC through a web-based system based upon reports from: (1) health care providers and clinical laboratories regarding human cases of WNV disease, (2) WNV presumption blood donors from blood collection agencies, (3) the testing of dead birds, (4) veterinarians to collect reports of WNV infection in nonhuman mammals, and (5) mosquitoes (Lindsey et al., 2008). Although typically identified as an essential component of public health practice for the control of transmissible diseases, the value of surveillance for noninfectious health problems is increasingly utilized in health services settings. For example, surveillance is an intervention utilized by nurses in the prevention of falls through the documentation of risk factors (e.g., physical impairments, cognitive impairments, inability to walk independently, incontinence, and use of certain medications such as diazepam, etc.) at admission and then monitoring these risk factors through the collection and monitoring clinical information throughout the course of the hospital stay. However, as with any active surveillance activities, the cost of the system needs to be considered relative to the resultant cost savings from the control or prevention of the outcome under surveillance (Klaucke et al., 1988; Shever et al., 2008). Thus, increasing the effectiveness of nursing intervention for surveillance for fall prevention may result in higher costs if more nursing staff would be required.",

            "text": "The early identification of epidemics of contagious diseases commonly relies on the presentation of syndrome clusters is termed syndromic surveillance (Table 5). A syndrome is the grouping of nonspecific general conditions commonly representing the early symptoms of a disease. Chief complaints of selected conditions of public health concern, upon presentation during the registration process, most commonly to the emergency room. The chief complaints are then scored or coded, typically by a software package, to be assigned and grouped to syndrome category. This is of particular importance as the detecting of these clusters of symptoms can provide an early warning of a major epidemic of transmissible diseases or bio-chemical-radiological terror attack. Thus, syndrome surveillance is viewed as a type of active surveillance. The identification of certain syndromes would trigger reporting to public health officials. Data for the identification of syndromes through active surveillance can come from emergency rooms, STD programs, lead poising prevention programs, vital records, immunization programs, ambulance calls, pharmacy medication sales of prescription and over the counter medications, and linked demographic, outpatient pharmacy claims, physician and facility claims. Syndromic surveillance can be used to estimate the burden of disease in a community, recognizing that only a limited number of persons may come in contact with the health care system to be identified. The source of the disease could be human, exposures, or from environmental sources (Cryptosporidium contamination of water). Because it is a type of active surveillance, it may be a more rapid and hence efficient and effective means of providing data to prioritize the direction of field investigations as to a potential cause. It is estimated that for every flu-like illness presenting in an emergency room, 60 illnesses may occur among residents; every visit for diarrheal illness may represent 251 illnesses in the community (Metzger et al., 2004).\n",

            "text": "The quality of a surveillance system is measured in terms of seven dimensions, its: sensitivity, representativeness, timeliness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, and PPV (Klaucke et al., 1988). These criteria apply regardless of the health condition is transmissible, chronic, or another health problem (e.g., abuse). Sensitivity is the ability to accurately identify cases both in terms of diagnostic accuracy as well as the total count of the cases and their severity. Hence, sensitivity is essential to establishing the validity of the measurement of the phenomena under surveillance (see also chapter \u201cMeasurement Issues in the Use of Epidemiologic Data\u201d). To assess if the criterion of sensitivity is met, the following questions should be asked: (1) Are reporting laboratories following appropriate protocols, including quality assurance, for testing? (2) Are providers following guidelines for the clinical spectrum for the definition of cases? (3) Can potential cases access the health care system to come to diagnostic attention, or will cases have to be identified through field surveys (e.g., contacting exposed persons by telephone)? Sensitivity of the system is also a function of the timeliness and completeness of reporting Representativeness is the assurance that all possible sources of data from which a case could be ascertained are funneled in to the surveillance system (e.g., for sexually transmitted disease [STD]: from STD clinics, prenatal clinics, prisons, etc.) and if these sources can accurately capture the projected incidence of the health event in the target population. Timeliness is defined as how quickly the cases are identified, specimens are transmitted for analysis, results transmitted to a central repository for analysis, and reports are prepared and disseminated. Increasingly, health departments are seeking to arrange for reporting through electronic means. Overhage et al. (2008) found that automated electronic laboratory reporting identified 4.4 times more cases and 7.9 days earlier compared with traditional spontaneous, paper-based methods or by postmail. Timely identification and reporting of cases, particularly within the disease-specific incubation period, is critical to not only accurately identify all cases, but also to capture information accurately about exposures, and implementation control measures quickly. Electronic reporting can also enhance the completeness of reporting to the health department and then support more focused investigation of the cases (Kit-Powell et al., 2008). Simplicity of the system is essential in order for staff as well as the population under surveillance and is a criterion which refers to both the structure as well as the processes. Less time is spent in staff training, formatting databases for analysis, and the timely distribution of information. Less error is generated with simple forms by increasing compliance with collecting and recording (see also chapter \u201cAdvancing Patient Safety Through the Practice of Managerial Epidemiology\u201d). Flexibility is the ability to accommodate and adapt to new and different diseases or health conditions because of variations in case definition, reporting sources, testing protocols, or exposures. Automated electronic reporting systems can also meet the criteria of simplicity and flexibility with entry of information directly onto computer screens and into computer databases which can be modified with ease. Acceptability is the level of participation individual practitioners (health care providers and public health), health care organizations, and labs are willing to engage in regarding ascertaining cases and reporting them. Concerns regarding measures to ensure confidentiality of the case, time involved in reporting, who assumes the cost of case finding, and liability may affect reporting. The reader is advised to consult and be familiar with federal and state laws and guidelines on the collection, storage, and use of protected health information which may change over time. The Centers for Disease Control (2003) is an important source of guidance regarding the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Public Health. The PPV of a surveillance system (or a screening or diagnostic test) is the proportion of individuals identified as a case who actually do have the condition under surveillance (or who are positive to screening and who have the condition targeted for screening) (see also Table 4 of chapter \u201cMeasurement Issues in the Use of Epidemiologic Data\u201d). The value of the PPV is a function of all the preceding quality elements of a surveillance system. The higher the PPV, the less likely that there are false leads in accurately characterizing an epidemic and more efficient deployment of resources in control measures.",

Incidence surveillance for HIV infection has been adopted as a component of the existing national HIV/AIDS reporting system which covers 22 states. The ability to identify new from long-standing cases of HIV-infection aids in determining if there has been a shift in population subgroups at risk because of changes in risk factor patterns and if disparities in health care or access to health care. The new system confirmed that the majority of new cases (72%) continued to be among men having sex with men. The HIV incident surveillance system has identified an increasing disparity in the incidence of HIV. The rate among black males 13\u201329 years was found to be 7.1 times higher than comparable age white males. Among black females, the incidence rate was 14 times the rate in white females (Prejean et al., 2008). These data stress the need for both more preventive efforts as well as improving access to care for high risk groups. Syndromic surveillance has been found particularly useful in detecting and monitoring annual outbreaks of influenza, norovirus, and rotavirus (Balter et al., 2005). Syndromic surveillance systems in \u201chigh-profile\u201d urban areas can also provide a reassurance during heightened terror or other security alert situations to provide reassurance to the public that a certain condition or exposure (e.g., anthrax) is not present. Chronic disease surveillance in the USA utilizes 92 indicators from nine data sources (Pelletier et al., 2005). With increased data capacities and cross-walks among data systems, the use of multiple indicators in surveillance to monitor progress in achieving disease control is desirable.",

The delay in reporting may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a disease outbreak as a diagnosis may take days to weeks. Knowledge of the type of surveillance systems upon which decisions are made may aid in planning the timing of the deployment of system health care resources when surge capacity is needed. To address all these challenges, the next generation of surveillance systems for notifiable disease called the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) will integrate the various reporting sources (labs, public) with clinical databases from hospitals, clinics, emergency rooms that are secured by Health Level Seven American National Standards Institute (HL7) security protocols for protected health information as well as an interface of automated grouping software (for syndromes), statistical and geospatial analysis (see Fig. 3). HL7 covers how messaging transactions regarding patient information to various data repositories are transmitted, authenticated, and determined to be complete and accurate (Edwards, 2008). This new system architecture will facilitate real-time surveillance and the early detection of outbreaks. The eventual integration of databases from outside the hospital setting, such as from pharmacies, is critical. Lack of access to health care and/or lack of health care insurance may prompt individuals to self-care/medications (e.g., purchase of over-the-counter antidiarrheals, cold remedies at pharmacies) or seek no care thereby missing and underestimating emerging diseases in some communities. The early detection of outbreaks through the integration of administrative data, public health data, laboratory data, and public/provider reporting through surveillance is an important strategy not only for preventing widespread disease outbreaks but also for combating infectious disease resistance to antibiotics through implementing control measures earlier when the first signs of increased statistical trends in diseases of public health importance emerge.\n",

Screening and surveillance as measures for promoting population health will become increasingly important, not only in public health, but also in every health services delivery setting as well as for payors in the USA and worldwide. The availability of many large publicly available data sets as well as the increasing use of electronic health records in the delivery of care will make surveillance of populations served a standard of care for managerial epidemiologic practice. Although different in purposes and methodologies, screening and surveillance provide opportunities for potentially more cost-effective means of promoting health in populations served, particularly if the health care organization is serving populations at high risk for chronic conditions.",
