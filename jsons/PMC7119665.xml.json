TLRs recognize conserved motifs on pathogens, designated \u2018pathogen-associated molecular patterns\u2019 (PAMPs) that are not found in higher eukaryotes. At present, ten human TLRs have been identified, which recognize distinct PAMPs and detect microorganisms that express these PAMPs. For example, peptidoglycan interacts with TLR2 [3], flagellin with TLR5 [4], whereas CpG-motifs in bacterial DNA activate TLR9 [5]. After recognition by and subsequent activation of the TLR, an intracellular signaling cascade leads to activation of mitogen activated protein kinases, like Erk and p38 and transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB [1].",

TLR4 can also interact with proteins, including heat shock proteins, fibronectin and taxol [2]. Recently, TLR4 was reported to be involved in innate immunity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in mice [7], [8]. TLR4-deficient mice showed a delayed clearance of RSV compared to wildtype mice, which was associated with reduced interleukin (IL)-12 expression and impaired natural killer cell and mononuclear cell pulmonary trafficking. In vitro studies revealed that activation of TLR4 is mediated by the RSV fusion protein (F protein), which is a prominent component of the viral envelope [7], [8], [9].",

            "text": "Sendai virus (mouse parainfluenza virus type 1) shares many structural, pathogenic, epidemiologic and clinical features with RSV [9], [10]. Interestingly, Sendai virus also expresses a fusion protein that shares structural features with the F proteins of RSV and other paramyxoviridae, orthomyxoviridae and retroviridae as well [10]. They are all type I integral membrane proteins synthesized as inactive precursor proteins that are activated upon cleavage by host-cell proteases. After activation, the N-terminus forms a hydrophobic stretch, the so-called fusion peptide, which is thought to be responsible for the actual merging of viral and cellular membranes. Finally, all fusion proteins have one or two heptad repeats, which form a hydrophobic core after trimerization of the fusion protein [10], [11], [12]. The F proteins of RSV and Sendai, and especially the above-mentioned structural features, are integral to the pathogenesis of infections with these viruses [9]. Therefore, in the present study we sought to determine the role of TLR4 in the innate immune response to respiratory tract infection with Sendai virus. We included influenza virus as a negative control, since it does not express a fusion protein like RSV and Sendai virus, but instead uses the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein for attachment and fusion of the virus with the target cell [10].",

Kurt-Jones et al. recently demonstrated that purified RSV F protein is capable of stimulating cytokine production by monocytes, through a TLR4-dependent mechanism [8]. This TLR4-dependent induction of inflammation by the RSV F protein corresponded with a reduced capacity of TLR4 mutant mice to clear RSV from their respiratory tract [7], [8]. Our present finding that TLR4 does not contribute to host defense against Sendai infection could be explained in several mutually non-exclusive ways. The F proteins of RSV and Sendai virus have been shown to share several structural features, like the hydrophobic N-terminal region and the heptad repeats [9], [10]. Our data seem to indicate that the Sendai F protein does not interact with TLR4. Therefore, the interaction between RSV F protein and TLR4 may depend on a unique sequence rather than a molecular pattern. Indeed, there are no major regions with identical amino acid sequence in the RSV F protein and the Sendai F protein [10]. Alternatively, glycosylation of the F protein, which has been shown to be different for RSV and Sendai [16], [17], may account for the activation of TLR4 by the RSV F protein. Furthermore, the activation of the RSV F protein requires no other protein, whereas Sendai requires the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein to activate the F protein [10]. This interaction between the F protein and the HN protein in Sendai and/or the difference in glycosylation of the F protein may prevent recognition of the Sendai F protein by TLR4. Nevertheless, Sendai virus can be effectively cleared by the host, which suggests that other as yet unidentified PAMPs expressed by Sendai virus, interacting with TLRs other than TLR4, may be more important for the early interaction with the host.",
