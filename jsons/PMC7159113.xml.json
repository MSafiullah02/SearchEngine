            "text": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for common respiratory viruses (RVs) are rarely included as a part of routine diagnostic tests performed in the majority of adult patients with acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) other than the influenza virus (IFV) because the clinical significance of these RVs has been stressed more so in pediatric patients and effective antiviral treatments remain underdeveloped.1, 2 However, considering that recent studies have shown their serious adverse impacts in adults,3, 4, 5 it may be necessary for clinicians who manage adult patients with ARI caused by one of these RVs to suspect the cause early; identify it quickly; and prevent it from spreading within the community or hospital through education, vaccination, or other methods of infection control. In current clinical practice, without the routine performance of RV PCR tests for adult patients with ARI, a national or regional laboratory RV surveillance database may be a useful adjunct to that end. The use of such datasets in clinical practice is already well\u2010accepted for IFV, which causes massive outbreaks in both children and adults throughout the community, leading to serious symptoms in some.6 Based on a national surveillance influenza dataset, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) sends warning messages about ongoing outbreaks of IFV through various media every winter and clinicians carefully respond to the signs, particularly since the 2009 influenza pandemic. However, regarding other RVs, whether the clinical use of such datasets in adult hospitalized patients with ARI is plausible remains unclear. Thus, we compared the national RV surveillance data of the KCDC (the KCDC data) to RV PCR data from adult patients who visited a tertiary care center for ARI and evaluated the usefulness of national RV surveillance data in clinical practice.",

Each sentinel site provides weekly reports of the number of patients who present with influenza\u2010like illnesses (ILIs) among those evaluated at KCDC sentinel sites. Of these, 36 also provide respiratory specimens from patients with ARI (laboratory sentinel site). The KCDC posts the data, including the rate of ILI prevalence among examined patients and the prevalence for the eight RVs among the tested specimens, on its website every week.8 Relevant KCDC data were retrieved from the KCDC website during the present study's period.",

Although this study focused on adult patients, the pediatric data of the study hospital were also included because the KCDC data included those from all age groups and the pediatric data were thought to be helpful in addressing some differences between the KCDC data and the adult data. We compared the KCDC graph to the adult graph in three ways. First, we compared them based on the timing of outbreaks and seasonal peaks for each RV. Second, we examined whether the occurrence of an outbreak in the KCDC graph in a given week could predict that in the adult graph in the same week. An outbreak of any RV was regarded to occur at a given week if the detection rate of the RV was >3% during that week. The detection rate of 3% was selected because most of the RV outbreaks in our data began just after the weekly detection rate went up over the value. The predictability of the KCDC data for the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult data was presented as a positive predictive value (PPV), a negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (SN), and specificity (SP). Third, a statistical correlation between the KCDC graph and the adult/pediatric graph was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals using Fisher transformation.",

Of the three dataset, the mean weekly positivity rate was highest among pediatric patients for most of the RVs, with the exception of IFV, which was highest in the KCDC data (Table 1). Regarding IFV, RSV, hMPV, and hCoV, the outbreaks represented in the three graphs were consistent with one another. However, in the graphs representing outbreak trends for RHV and ADV, the temporal trends were not as consistent across the datasets as they were for the other RVs (Figure 2). The numbers of hBoV\u2010positive and PIV\u2010positive tests were very small among adult patients (Table 1) and positive cases occurred only sporadically (Figure 2).

For all eight RVs, the relationship between the KCDC data and the pediatric data was observed to be statistically significant. Predictabilities of the KCDC data for the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult data were the best for IFV. NPVs of the KCDC data for the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult data were generally high regarding the eight RVs (85\u2010100%), whereas PPVs were high for such in the pediatric data (72.3\u2010100%).",

For these four RVs, statistically significant correlations were also found between the KCDC data and the adult data. Our study results strongly support the clinical use of the national laboratory surveillance data during the outbreak of IFV, regarding that the correlation coefficient between the KCDC data and adult/pediatric data was the highest and the predictabilities were the best for IFV as compared with that for the other RVs. However, our data also show that such clinical consideration of the national data may be plausible during outbreaks of RSV, hMPV, and hCoV. Given that the numbers of hBoV\u2010positive and PIV\u2010positive RV PCR tests were so small in adult patients, if RV PCR tests would be more frequently performed for adults outside of the flu season (see the outbreak seasons of these two RVs in Table 1), a similar correlation would likely be observed for these two RVs. Furthermore, we should pay attention to the fact that the NPVs of the KCDC data for the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult data were high regarding all eight RVs. In other words, for each of the eight RVs, an occurrence of no outbreak in the KCDC data may be predictive of an occurrence of no outbreak of the respective RV among adult hospitalized patients. If one of these RVs was frequently detected in a hospital or any locale in a manner not consistent with its prevalence in the KCDC data, we might suspect that hospital or local RV outbreaks were ongoing separate from community outbreaks. All of these findings suggest that the KCDC data may be a helpful adjunct in uncovering outbreaks of RVs in adult hospitalized patients with ARI, especially in those clinical practices that currently do not perform RV PCR tests in ARI patients routinely.",

For example, the KCDC data include all age groups. Regarding the fact that RV PCR tests are usually more frequently performed in children than in adults and more frequently have positive results among children than among adults, it is well\u2010understood that the values of the weekly positive rates in the KCDC data are mostly positioned between higher rates from the pediatric data and lower ones from the adult data (Table 1). In other words, the pediatric graph may be an inflated form of the KCDC graph, whereas the adult graph may represent a deflated form of the KCDC graph. This may be responsible for the fact that, with regard to the predictability of the KCDC data for the occurrence of an outbreak in the other two datasets, PPVs were high for the pediatric data and NPVs were high for the adult data, generally for all 8 RVs. Considering that RVs have some differences in their impacts on adults and children, we suggest that the KCDC data should be classified according to age group.",
