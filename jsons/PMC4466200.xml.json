The new virus was named SARS-CoV,10 and before the end of the outbreak over 8000 cases were confirmed in several countries, resulting in about 812 fatalities. Since then two additional coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, were discovered in humans and most recently, in 2012, MERS-CoV was identified as a second zoonotic coronavirus that can cause lethal respiratory infections in humans.",

Preparation of the boronic acid 9 followed established procedures21 and was used immediately without further characterization. Using standard Suzuki reaction conditions in the presence of freshly prepared Pd(PPh3)4,\n10 was obtained in a 45% yield. In order to obtain the xanthosine analogue, 10 was treated with Pd/C to remove the benzyl protecting groups to yield final compound 1 in a 26% yield. It was also discovered that by lowering the temperature of the reaction, the benzyl groups could be selectively removed from the base. This is convenient, as it would allow for future functionalization of 11 without the need to selectively reprotect the free hydroxyl.",

Unfortunately, the reaction resulted in a single site transformation at the 4-position. Due to extreme reaction conditions and low yield this route was abandoned. Ultimately, the guanosine analogues were obtained through Stille coupling of key intermediate 8 with the appropriate pyrimidine 13. Pyrimidine 13 was prepared from commercially available 2-amino-5-chloro-6-methoxy pyrimidine according to published procedures. The subsequent coupling was completed using modified Stille coupling conditions based on the findings of Mee et al.22\n",

We have shown that this approach produces medicinally relevant molecules capable of inhibiting HCoV-NL63 and MERS-CoV replication in cell culture. Although the parental compound, acyclovir, serves as a polymerase inhibitor,25, 26 it is yet unclear how these novel analogues disrupt viral replication.
