            "text": "Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major threat for immunocompromised hosts. Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy are essential to improve the prognosis of the disease [1], [2]. However, the diagnosis of IA remains difficult. Currently it is frequently based on a set of host, clinical and mycologic criteria, such as those defined jointly by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycosis Study Group (MSG) [3]. In the EORTC/MSG criteria, galactomannan (GM) or \u03b2-d-glucan assays are the only noninvasive mycologic diagnostic methods currently available. Although these assays are of interest and widely used, they lack sensitivity, especially in nonneutropenic patients [4]. They also may be influenced by the use of certain medical devices [5] or antibiotics [6], [7], leading to a large number of false-positive results. GM detection has also been reported in invasive fungal diseases not due to Aspergillus\n[8], [9], [10]. Moreover, \u03b2-d-glucan is present in many fungus species and is therefore not specific to aspergillosis. Other tools have been developed to improve diagnosis, including in particular real-time PCR in blood samples to detect circulating Aspergillus DNA. Several studies have shown the potential interest of this PCR approach, but because of a lack of standardization, it has not yet been included in the EORTC/MSG mycologic criteria. Recently however, a panel of experts has argued for its inclusion in those criteria [11].",

Quantification was achieved using five serial tenfold dilutions of the plasmid PGEMT Easy-Afu28S containing the target. The final PCR result was expressed in numbers of copies per millilitre of serum. We used an internal control in our assay for all wells (TaqMan exogenous Internal Positive Control) as well as an extraction control (albumin gene) for each sample.

We, however, found only a nonstatistically significant trend for the GM index in the determination of outcomes. Nevertheless, Bergeron et al. also found no association between outcome and Aspergillus DNA detection, while our work supports that the initial level of Aspergillus DNA is highly predictive of the 90-day mortality rate. As concerns our results more specifically, we found that a PCR threshold of 150 copies/mL could discriminate patients with low (below the threshold) or high (above) probabilities of 90-day mortality. PCR thus has a much greater discriminative capacity than does the determination of the GM index. This result could be useful for identifying patients who may benefit from more intensive care and designing further clinical studies. We also showed that PCR quantification is useful in follow-up to predict outcomes. After only 1 week of therapy, an increase or decrease in the number of copies is not relevant for the assessment of treatment efficacy or outcome. However, PCR results after 2 weeks of treatment did appear to have relevance. In our study, patients who had a negative PCR (to which we add one patient who had cleared more than 99% of the initial load) between days 14 and 20 were all alive at day 30, and seven of them were still alive at day 90 vs. none of the five patients who remained PCR positive.",
