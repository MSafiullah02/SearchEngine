The members of PV include rhinoviruses (RV), enteroviruses (EV), coxsackieviruses (CV), polioviruses, echoviruses, encephalomyocarditis viruses, meningitis virus, foot and mouth viruses, hepatitis A virus, and so on. Among them, RV is the major cause of the common cold, whereas EV and CV infection can cause hand, foot, and mouth diseases in human and animals. In severe cases, EV can damage the central nervous systems leading to viral meningitis, encephalitis, and severe myocarditis, as well as fatal pulmonary edema [2], [3], [4], [5]. CV strain B is a major human pathogen that causes meningitis and mycocarditis leading to heart failure in young adults and congestive heart failure [6]. In these PV, a chymotrypsin-like protease (named 3Cpro) is required to process polyproteins into mature proteins for viral replication, which represents a promising anti-viral drug target [7].",

An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel human CoV, was spread from China to 29 countries in 2003, infecting a total of \u223c8000 people and killing \u223c800 patients [8]. SARS-CoV contains a 3C-like protease (3CLpro) analogous to the 3Cpro of PV, responsible for processing two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa). Other members of human CoV including CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-HKU1, and CoV-NL63 also require a 3CLpro in the maturation of viral proteins.",

However, their inhibitors can not be mutually used without modification. For example, AG7088, a potent inhibitor of RV and other picornaviral 3Cpro\n[16], failed to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CLpro\n[17]. Unlike the 3CLpro, which is dimeric and in which each subunit is composed of three domains, the 3Cpro is a monomer with only the two catalytic domains. The structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 1\n) shows some sequence differences, which may alter inhibitor specificity. In this study, we performed high throughput screening using a library of \u223c6800 compounds to find five novel inhibitors of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro, 4 of which also inhibited another human CoV-229E 3CLpro, but did not inhibit the 3Cpro from RV14, CVB3, and EV71. But, one compound was found to almost equally inhibit these 3CLpro and 3Cpro. From computer modeling, we rationalized the binding discrepancy of the inhibitors against these proteases. The information is useful to further develop more potent individual or common inhibitors of 3Cpro and 3CLpro of PV and CoV for anti-viral drug discovery.",

The most potent compound was 45240, and its IC50 values in inhibiting the 3C(L) proteases were measured to be 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM (SARS-CoV 3CLpro), 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM (CoV-229E 3CLpro), 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM (CVB3 3Cpro), 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM (EV71 3Cpro), and 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM (RV14 3Cpro) (Table 2). This compound contains four rings, three phenyl groups and one imidazole, surrounding a central dihydropyrazole ring, without the lengthy side chain as seen in 43146. Compound 68638 with benzylcyclohexane ring fused with the dihydropyrazole ring and acetyl and iodobenzyl groups attached to the central ring showed less inhibition against both 3Cpro and 3CLpro (Table 2). The other two compounds, 55688 and 55585, with shorter side chains attached to the benzimidazolyl group showed similar inhibitory activities as compared to 43146 (Table 2).",

To rationalize the binding discrepancy of these inhibitors against these proteases, their binding modes with SARS-CoV 3CLpro and four other proteases were modeled and some of them are shown in Fig. 4\n. The first four inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro are more rigid because the thiazolopyridine in 21155, the dichlorobenzoquinolinone in 22723, the isoindoledione in 27548, and the oxazole in 48511 adopt planar structures and the three substituents of the oxazole ring in 48511 are fixed in a conformer, due to the 1,2-steric interaction between the acetate group and the N-aryl imino group as well as the biaryl interaction between the phenyl and oxazole to prohibit their free rotation. All these compounds can be considered as two rigid aromatic moieties connected by a small linker. Based on the computer modeling, each of these aromatic moieties is bound to S1 or S2 site of SARS protease by forming H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4A\u2013D). As shown in the computer modeling, Glu166 side chain of SARS 3CLpro forms H-bonds with these four inhibitors. However, the corresponding amino acid residue in 3Cpro is Gly164, which lacks the side chain to form H-bond with any of these compounds (also see Fig. 4F), leading to loss of inhibition. In addition, the 3Cpro have more open but shallow S2 site (due to its partial blockage by Leu127) than 3CLpro according to the crystal structures of RV 3Cpro\n[20] and CVB3 3Cpro (Lee et al., unpublished results) compared to 3CLpro (also see Fig. 4F). Thus, 3Cpro can not hold these compounds tightly.",

Different from the binding modes of the other 4 inhibitors, the diphenyl 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole moiety of 43146 fits well at the S1\u2032 and S2 sites in the SARS 3CLpro (Fig. 4E) with the rest of the molecule at the S3 site and beyond. With this binding mode, the compound was predicted to also bind well in the 3Cpro, consistent with the inhibition data. In fact, RV 3Cpro prefers a phenyl group at the S2 site as evidenced by its strong inhibition by AG7088 which has a P2-fluorophenylalanine. Thus, it could be rationalized by computer modeling that only 43146 among the five hits can inhibit the three 3Cpro in addition to the 3CLpro.",

Compared to 43146, 55688 and 55585 only have minor structural difference with shorter alkyl groups attached to the benzimidazole ring, so that they showed similar inhibition against the proteases. The fused ring system and the phenyl group in 68638 may also span from S1\u2032 to S2 sites in both kinds of proteases, yielding similar inhibition. However, 45240 showed a significantly better inhibition against the 3Cpro than 43146. Apparently, the lengthy side chain attached to the phenyl group in the compound did not provide additional interaction with the protease, consistent with the binding mode shown in Fig. 4E. However, the additional interaction is provided by the pyridine ring bound near the more open S1\u2032 site in 3Cpro.",

However, it did not inhibit 3CLpro from SARS-CoV [17]. This may be partially due to the blockage of its P1-lactam ring by the relatively larger Glu166 side chain and also the S2 site of 3CLpro is narrower although it is deeper. Therefore, when the P2-phenylalanine is changed to non-planar leucine or cyclohexane without changing the P1-lactam, they became good inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro\n[21]. Unlike AG7088, which is a ketomethyl isostere of a tripeptide-conjugated ester, compound 43146 is not peptide-like. From the random screening as shown in the study, we have found a starting point toward the development of non-peptide multiple-function inhibitors against CoV and PV. With further modification of these individual and common inhibitors of the viral proteases, we hope to find solution for the possible reoccurrence of SARS and other diseases caused by the viruses with the 3Cpro and 3CLpro.",
