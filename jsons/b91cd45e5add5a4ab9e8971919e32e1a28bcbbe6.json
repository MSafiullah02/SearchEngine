By contrast, the RCT of Vinku2 did quantify virus genomic load; in an earlier analysis, we report that prednisolone treatment reduced the recurrence of wheezing in a group of children with a rhinovirus genome load of >7000 copies/mL in a 12month follow-up.9 Our current 4-year results are in line with these previous findings and support the view that the risk of asthma can be reduced when high-risk children are identified early and treated with OCS. OCS is likely to downregulate asthma-associated inflammatory pathways by decreasing the transcription of many inflammatory genes and/or their transcription factors and increasing the expression of various anti-inflammatory genes.4,23 Furthermore, starting the acute care early may be important, as rhinovirus load peaks early in infection.24 It is important to concentrate on finding the phenotype of young wheezing children that could most likely benefit from early OCS treatment.
