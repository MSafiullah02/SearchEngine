All of these whorls are interpreted as modified leaves, as Goethe proposed 200 years ago (Pelaz et al. 2001; Ditta et al. 2004). Flowers develop under the control of homeotic genes, many of them from the MADS-box gene family. They encode transcription factors that play crucial roles in the development of floral primordia and the establishment of floral organ identities (Weigel 1998; Theissen et al. 2000; Theissen 2001; Becker and Theissen 2003).",

            "text": "The genetic regulation of floral organ formation in typical eudicot flowers, such as Arabidopsis\nthalina or Antirrhinum majus, was initially described with the ABC model for the specification of floral organ identities (Bowman et al. 1991; Coen and Meyerowitz 1991). Since then, new classes of genes have been identified, such as D-function genes thought to be involved in ovule identity (Angenent et al. 1995). The four class E SEPALLATA genes encode proteins that are apparently required in floral organ identity determination (Pelaz et al. 2000, 2001; Ferrario et al. 2003; Ditta et al. 2004). The products of the A, B, C and E genes act in a combinatorial manner to achieve three types of activity. In the outermost whorl, A and E genes function to control sepal identity. In the second whorl, A, B, and E genes together specify petal identity. In the third whorl, B, C, and E genes act in concert to direct stamen identity, while in the innermost whorl, C and E genes determine carpel identity (Bowman et al. 1991; Coen and Meyerowitz 1991; Honma and Goto 2001; Pelaz et al. 2000, 2001; Theissen 2001; Ditta et al. 2004). The functions of A and C genes are considered mutually antagonistic and the expression of one represses that of the other (Bowman et al. 1991; Coen and Meyerowitz 1991; Drews et al. 1991; Egea-Cortines et al. 1999; Pelaz et al. 2000; Theissen 2001).",

In addition to petal and stamen expression, however, AP3 and PI transcripts are detected in carpel tissue in basal angiosperms such as Amborella and Nuphar (Kim et al. 2005). Other angiosperms and gymnosperm further possess a sister clade of B genes, termed Bsister (Bs) genes, and expression studies revealed that these genes are predominantly expressed in female reproductive organs (including carpels and ovules) (Becker et al. 2002).",

The gene expression pattern in the perianth was very similar to that in the uppermost leaves (Fig. 1a\u2013d). However, we did not detect transcripts encoding putative MADS-box transcription factors in the uppermost leaves (Table 1 and Table S1). Of the 78 upregulated perianth transcripts (Table S1), seven putative MADS-box transcription factors (DV038213, DV038420, DV038528, DV038434, DV038183, DV038296, DV038162), including three putative APETALA3-like proteins, two AGL6-like proteins, and two similar to putative MADS542 protein were found (Table 1). Sixty-two genes were upregulated in the stamens (Table S1). Of the stamen-specific transcripts, three genes encoded MADS-box transcription factors (DV038577, DV038682, DV038420), including one putative MADS box transcription factor, AP3-like, and one putative MADS542 protein (Table 1). Carpels showed more upregulated genes than the other organs, probably due to their complex tissue types, with 100 genes showing significant upregulation. They included three transcripts encoding putative MADS-box transcription factors (Table S1), two encoding putative AP3-like proteins (DV038213, DV038650), and one encoding a putative MADS542 protein (DV038528) (Table 1).\n\n\n",

The Bsister gene AeAP3-2, however, is expressed in female reproductive structures (Kramer and Irish 2000). Recent comprehensive expression studies in other plants groups revealed that Bsister genes are mainly transcribed in female reproductive organs (Becker et al. 2002; de Folter et al. 2006).

            "text": "In the typical ABC model based on A. thaliana, the B-class genes, AP3 and PI control the specification of petals in conjunction with A-class genes and stamens in conjunction with C-class genes in the second and third whorls, respectively (Bowman et al. 1989; Coen and Meyerowitz 1991; Ma and dePamphilis 2000). The borders of B-function gene expression are also not so clear-cut in Arabidopsis: AP3 and PI, the major Arabidopsis B-function genes, are not entirely restricted to the second and third whorl of the flowers; instead, AP3 is expressed in parts of the first whorl, and PI is expressed in parts of the fourth whorl at early stage (Jack et al. 1992; Goto and Meyerowitz 1994; Chen et al. 2000). It is believed that physical interactions of the two proteins are required for protein stability and in turn maintenance of their expression, so that in older flowers their expression is limited to whorls two and three (Goto and Meyerowitz 1994; Riechmann et al. 1996). It is possible that such a stabilization mechanism will not be present in basal angiosperms. Based on our cDNA macroarray data, the expression domain of B-class AP3-like genes in A. caudigerum was found to be broader than for their counterparts in eudicots (Fig. 7), as AcAP3-1 expression was found in carpels, and other AP3-like genes were also expressed in the perianth and stamens (Fig. 7; Table 1). Comparative studies of B-class AP3 gene homologs conducted in the family Aristolochiaceae reported AP3 gene expression for the genera Saruma and Aristolochia (Jaramillo and Kramer 2004). Specifically, B-class AP3 genes were found to be expressed in the second, third and fourth whorls of Saruma henryi, as well as the third and fourth whorls of Aristolochia manshuriensis (Jaramillo and Kramer 2004). This is consistent with the view of a broader expression pattern of B-class genes in basal angiosperms (Buzgo et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2005).\n",

Therefore, the early floral organ development of A. caudigerum does not progress from the outer whorl inward, but instead the development of the second whorl is delayed. It is consistent with the hypothesis of Buzgo et al. (2004) who suggested a gradual transition in the expression of floral B-class genes in Amborella. Our cDNA macroarray data, RNA in situ hybridization, and qRT-PCR results indicated that AcAP3-1/DV038650 is expressed in carpels, and particularly strongly in the endothelium of ovules. This gene\u2019s unusual expression may explain the retarded development of the second-whorl organs.",

            "text": "Kramer and Irish (1999, 2000) proposed that the ABC model was not rigidly fixed during the earliest stages of angiosperm evolution. Irish (2003) cautioned that the applicability of this model outside of the core eudicots would require testing. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest patterns of gradual transitions among flowers that prompt a \u2018\u2018fading borders\u2019\u2019 view of gene expression. This evidence includes the morphological transition between organ identities from perianth to carpels, the results from genome-scale phylogenomics research, and the implied gradual shift in the expression of the B-class genes across the flower in the basal angiosperms (Kramer et al. 2003; Buzgo et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2007a, b). However, there could be antagonistic interactions between the A-class gene products, which are partially responsible for perianth identities, and the C-class genes, which specify stamen and carpel identities in the higher eudicots (Coen and Meyerowitz 1991; Drews et al. 1991; Theissen 2001). In Arabidopsis thaliana, APETALA2 (AP2) of the A-class genes promotes the B gene expression domain by antagonizing AGAMOUS (AG) (Zhao et al. 2007). Winter et al. (2002a, b) pointed out that an ancestral B protein from the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner as a homodimer, whereas in Antirrhinum majus the DEF-like protein binds to DNA only as a heterodimeric complex with the GLO-like protein. Less strict requirements for heterodimerization or autoregulatory upregulation may facilitate spatial shifts in the B-function in taxa outside of the eudicots, as detected by the broader gene expression of B-class genes among flowers of A. caudigerum, Amborella and other basal angiosperm lineages. Therefore, we support the contention that the ABC model was not established at the outset of angiosperm evolution, but instead occurred in a simpler form in the basal angiosperms, and gradually evolved into the canonical ABC model in the more derived higher eudicot lineages.",
