            "text": "Since time immemorial (>3,000 yr), captive breeding of wild animals and use of their products for food, clothing, or medicinal purposes have played an important role in Chinese culture (Still 2003, Chen 2006). As declining wild populations and poaching proved unprofitable, wildlife farming became increasingly popular and lucrative. Captive breeding populations were successfully established for >230 wildlife species (Cao 2014; for some commercially bred mammalian examples, see Table 1). By the end of 2006, 19,018 wildlife breeding and farming ventures existed in China, including 3,166 commercial companies engaged in the processing and utilization of wildlife products (Meng 2008). Captive wildlife and alternative livestock industries in China have experienced unprecedented growth in recent decades (Lin 2004, Nijman 2010). For example, the Chinese fur industry is reported to grow by approximately 28% every year (2008\u20132010), with >70 million farmed foxes, minks, and raccoon dogs in 2010, compared with 55 million animals in 2009 (Petry and Liting 2010). These figures make China the largest fox and raccoon dog producer and the second\u2010largest mink pelt producer worldwide (Petry and Liting 2010). None of these species is currently listed as threatened by the IUCN Red List (IUCN Red List 2015). Another example for China's growing wildlife industry is the sika deer (Cervus nippon; IUCN Red List 2015 status: LC), a species that was hunted in China for centuries to use its antler velvet in traditional medicine. Wild sika deer populations are decreasing (<1,000 animals left in China; Harris 2015), so sika deer farming has become a large\u2010scale industry with approximately 300,000 sika deer kept in captivity by the end of the 20th Century (Ohtaishi and Sheng 1990). In 2004, 9,465 sika deer farms were reported, with 452,355 farmed sika deer and an annual production of 73,000 kg of deer antler velvet (Meng and Yin 2008). Wild sika deer numbers are slowly recovering in China because of the increased provision of antler velvet from captive stock (Harris 2015). The most precious wildlife species farmed in captivity are musk deer (Moschus spp.; Sheng and Liu 2007). Similar to the fur and antler velvet industries, the Chinese musk production is increasing (Wang et al. 2015). Since the 1950s, musk deer have been kept in captivity to harvest their musk, an oily substance secreted by a specific gland located between the genital and the naval of adult males (Parry\u2010Jones and Wu 2001, Wang et al. 2015). For >5,000 years, musk was used for the production of traditional medicine but also as a scent fixative in cosmetics and perfumes (Homes 1999). The annual average musk extraction per individual is only 12.26 g, while the Chinese demand is estimated to be approximately 2,000 kg/annum (Parry\u2010Jones and Wu 2001, Cheng et al. 2002). Thus, musk is currently traded at approximately US$45,000/kg making it more precious than gold (presently dealt at approximately US$38,000/kg; Wang et al. 2015). These examples show how important wildlife products are in Chinese culture and highlight their significant economic value. The ever\u2010increasing demand for wildlife products in conjunction with dwindling wild populations eventually prompted the Chinese government to implement and follow the supply\u2010side approach to conservation by adopting the first WPL.",

Beside other measures, such as the declaration of protected areas and serious law enforcement, wildlife farming can be an effective method to expand the number of wildlife populations that would otherwise face further population declines and possibly extinction (Zhou 1997, Wang 2002, Mitra 2005, Wang et al. 2010, Tensen 2016). Market\u2010based conservation strategies are not effective on their own, but seem to be best utilized as supplements to regulation and education (Zhong 2005, Sun and Wang 2007, Phelps et al. 2013). Above examples show that under certain circumstances the supply\u2010side approach to conservation can be successful. These circumstances include that 1) farmed wildlife products should be considered equal in quality, taste, and status; 2) the demand for wildlife products can be satisfied by legalized products; 3) farming should be more cost\u2010efficient than illegal hunt; 4) wildlife farmers should not depend on wild populations for restocking; and 5) laundering of illegal wildlife products into the commercial trade must be prevented (Tensen 2016).",

            "text": "In addition to reducing consumption of wild specimens and thus releasing pressure from natural populations (Mitra 2005, Jiang et al. 2007, Wang 2011, Tensen 2016), advantages of wildlife farming include: 1) protecting and managing wildlife species as a (genetic) reserve resource in captivity (Meng and Wang 1999, Che 2000, Sheng and Liu 2007); 2) providing legal and sustainable resources for utilization (Brown and Layton 2001, Bulte and Damania 2005); 3) providing resources and scientific data for medical and health research, teaching, and science propagation (Pan et al. 2001, Sun and Wang 2007); and 4) promoting development of related industries such as the fur processing industry, the pharmaceutical industry, or tourism, and thus being an integral part of China's national economy (Fu 1993, Pan et al. 2001, Sun and Wang 2007, Cao 2014). However, there are also a number of drawbacks to the supply\u2010side approach: by generating supplies from captive breeding stocks, wildlife commodity prices will fall, thereby lowering the incentive to hunt illegally. This will create an increased demand and raised incentives for poachers, simply because more people can afford the products, eventually leading to increased rather than decreased wild take (Fischer 2004). Moreover, supply\u2010side approaches often ignore the institutional framework in which the wildlife trade takes place and potential strategic responses of traders and agents (Damania and Bulte 2007). For example, the illegal trade of wildlife commodities is controlled by a small number of organized, criminal groups (Damania and Bulte 2007). These agents operate between poachers and consumers (or retailers), setting prices for poachers and determining the quantities to be released to the markets. Critical analysis including these aspects found that the effects of supply\u2010side policies may contribute to further devastation of wild stocks instead of saving them (Damania and Bulte 2007, Tensen 2016). To counteract and avoid these drawbacks in the future, the Chinese government was prompted to review the previous WPL and implement a revised version.",

            "text": "In March 1989, the People's Republic of China implemented the first WPL. After nearly 30 years of practice, setback, and experience, Chinese lawmakers made some progress in the field of wildlife legislation (Jiang 2003, Zhou and Zhang 2003, Chen 2006, Hua 2012). This progress is reflected by the new, revised WPL, which passed China's National People's Congress in July 2016 and took effect on 1 January 2017 (Zhang 2016). We will illustrate the improvements of the revised WPL and join the public discussion on China's wildlife protection by debating the relative merits and shortcomings of the revised WPL (Table 2). In recent decades, wildlife farming and use of wild animal products has become a sensitive and controversial issue, arousing public attention and arguments among the international conservation community (Parker and Graham 1971, Geist 1985, Milner\u2010Gulland and Leader\u2010Williams 1992, Kock 1995, Brown and Layton 2001, Wan 2004, Bulte and Damania 2005, Mitra 2005, Challender et al. 2015, Tensen 2016). In China, this became particularly true just before the newly enacted WPL took effect. National, but also international media coverage, and the public response were fairly critical of the revised law, although some comments highlighted the advantages of the new legislation (EIA 2016; Wang et al. 2016a,b; Zhang 2016; Diao 2017; Gong et al. 2017; Liu 2017).",

            "text": "The main concern regarding the revised WPL and its implementing regulations is a putative emphasis on wildlife utilization; that is, encouraging captive breeding and expanding opportunities to utilize wildlife, rather than protecting it (Ji 2016, Lei 2016, Li 2016, Mang 2016, Xie 2016, Xu 2016, Yu 2016). The law stimulates the demand for wildlife products rather than creating incentives to reduce it and consumers feel encouraged to use wildlife products although synthetic alternatives are often available (Diao 2016, Guo and Wei 2016, Ji 2016, Jiang 2016, Ma 2016). However, no matter whether the demand is met by the captive breeding or not, wild take will be reduced. Any proportion of the overall demand that can be covered by captive breeding reduces take from the wild of a similar proportion (Jori et al. 1995, Parry\u2010Jones 2001, Lapointe et al. 2007, Biggs et al. 2013). For example, average annual bear bile production in China has reached 12,590 kg/annum, a supply that can almost meet the current market demand and thus reduce the wild take (Cao 2014). Similarly, the fur industry or the sika deer farming industry are able to meet consumer demands (Chen 2006, Meng and Yin 2008). According to the revised WPL, China's new approach to conservation follows 2 lines\u2014protection and utilization\u2014and is thus in line with policy documents published by the international conservation community (UNEP 1992, IUCN 2000, Abensperg\u2010Traun 2009). The revised WPL highlights the priority of conservation over utilization (Article 4; Li 2016, Liu 2017) and is fairly balanced in weighing the 2 approaches against each other (Wang et al. 2016a,b). The law clarifies that utilization must be rational and sustainable, and announces strict measures of law enforcement (Articles 4, 29\u201335; Wang et al. 2016a,b). Apart from breeding programs for scientific research or conservation purposes, the phrasing avoids any terms that encourage or promote the domestication or the captive breeding of wildlife (Article 25). The Chinese government will also no longer award outstanding achievements in the domestication and breeding of wildlife as promoted by the old WPL (Article 9 revised WPL vs. Article 4 previous WPL). Furthermore, it was clarified that Chinese consumers can only use wildlife products that originate from captive populations, and consumption or trade of specimens collected in the wild is clearly prohibited (Articles 29, 30; Wang et al. 2016a,b). The revised WPL is very specific in outlining wildlife species that are exempted from any use, compiling them in a detailed list of Chinese species under special state protection.",

            "text": "It was further claimed that the revised WPL opens the door for the laundering of poached wildlife by registered breeding institutions and may bring illegal goods to legal markets when trade is liberalized (Fischer 2004). Other critics raise concerns that the control of distribution links is not guaranteed, a marking permit system is not in place, and competency and jurisdiction are ill defined (Ma 2016, Xie 2016, Xu 2016). This will lead to competition between law enforcement authorities and more live\u2010capture of wild specimens to satisfy the increasing demand of wildlife farms. To counter laundering, the Chinese government implemented a wildlife marking permit system (Articles 27, 28, 33), which is fundamental to China's wildlife protection and management legislation (Huang 2016). It ensures that the sources of wild specimens and products are legal (i.e., from licensed, registered captive breeding institutions) and thus sustainable and traceable. Granting of marks and labels is stringent: companies and breeding institutions must provide confirmatory materials (certificates of origin, purchase documents, breeding records, etc.), and rigorous reviews in conjunction with in situ evaluations determine whether marks will be awarded (Wang 2006, Huang 2016). Without a \u2018place\u2010of\u2010origin\u2019 label, wildlife and products thereof cannot be traded. Government authorities at various levels and their relevant departments will conduct the supervision and inspection of sale, purchase, utilization, transport, and mailing of wildlife and products thereof (Article 34). While the revised WPL clearly defines competency and jurisdiction (Articles 42\u201356), the criminal law of the Peoples Republic of China provides the disciplinary measures. Marking and labeling of wild animals and their products is an internationally recognized and effective measure to control the use and trade of captive bred wildlife and its products (e.g., EU Council Regulation No. 338/97). Marking is highly valued by governments and NGOs, and shown to be a useful tool for internal or cross\u2010border trade control (Lin et al. 1999, Wang 2006, Huang 2016; but see also Zhang et al. 2008). Marking schemes were developed to prevent fraud, curtail illegal trade of specimens and products within the scope of the revised WPL, and ensure that traded specimens are in fact those referred to in the enclosed documents.",

This will increase the overall demand, eventually augmenting the wildlife farmers\u2019 need to restock with wild specimens (Fischer 2004, Stiles 2004, Bulte and Damania 2005, Drury 2009, Abbott and Van Kooten, 2011). This phenomenon is based on consumer behavior and preferences; therefore, the WPL has only limited opportunities to influence it directly. Creating more conservation awareness through improved education, public outreach, and comprehensive media coverage is the only way to induce a change in consumer behavior (Article 8). Awareness creation must first tackle the overall demand for wildlife products and secondly\u2014if demand persists\u2014stigmatize consumption of illegally obtained specimens and encourage the consumption of legal products (Zhang and Yin 2014, Duan 2015). Only when captive\u2010bred products dominate the market and demand does not increase, can wildlife farming be beneficial for conservation (Bulte and Damania 2005).",

            "text": "Another issue is the current situation of animal health and welfare conditions in Chinese wildlife farms (Petry and Liting 2010, Pickett and Harris 2015, EIA 2016). Opponents assert that health and welfare stipulations are not included in the revised WPL and it completely ignores the increased risk of epidemics related to wildlife farming (Diao 2016, Yu 2016). Since the pandemic disease outbreaks of avian influenza and SARS coronavirus in the early 2000s, the Chinese government focused great attention to the management of wildlife health and welfare in captive breeding institutions (Smith 2006, Arima et al. 2013). The revised law added a new article (Article 16) to prevent, identify, and mitigate the risk of epidemics at the interface of wildlife, domestic livestock, and humans. The legislation also regulates how farm animals are raised, kept, and transported in accordance with their natural habitats and behavioral properties (Article 26). Captive breeding of wildlife in China should be based on the ecological and behavioral requirements of each wildlife species to conform best to animal health and welfare standards (Wang et al. 2016a,b). This includes sufficient space, opportunities to retreat (from conspecifics and humans), enrichment structures, and suitable facilities to constrain animals for health treatment and breeding management (Hosey et al. 2013). At present, there are only 9 wildlife breeding institutions in China that have been awarded the official certificate of the China Forest Certification Council, indicating that their breeding and management conditions have achieved a satisfactory level of animal health and welfare standards (Wang et al. 2019). One reason for the low level of legal registration and law abidance is the lack of governmental resources to efficiently control compliance (Zhao et al. 2012). Currently, it seems impossible to strengthen the legal control of wildlife farming only by relying on government institutions and their financial and administrative resources. Article 5 of the revised WPL encourages private NGOs to support government bodies, enforce the revised WPL, and supervise and control health and welfare conditions (Zhang 2016). It is thus suggested that wildlife management control and captive breeding licensing should be gradually replaced by third\u2010party certification and monitoring. This will help government bodies to improve supervision efficiency and reduce public spending. It is further hoped that legally certified breeding institutions play a positive role within the industry and function as a role model for other wildlife farms in China and East Asia. Guidance for this supervision process could be the forest certification manual published by the Chinese State Forestry Administration (2014). This manual is an essential part of China's forest certification system, and defines the basic requirements for captive breeding of wildlife, including human resources (animal keepers, veterinarians), infrastructure (water, heating, etc.), dietary requirements and nutrition, reproduction, animal health and welfare, sanitation, animal euthanasia, and product acquisition. The licensing system, depicted by the forest certification manual, provides the requirements to verify whether wildlife\u2010breeding units comply with relevant laws and principles of sustainability. The manual further aims to create awareness among wildlife farmers, guide them toward establishing sustainable management conditions and to follow animal health and welfare regulations. The legal award of captive breeding licenses and their strict control and enforcement are the only way for China to continue to obtain recognition from the international conservation community and realize the vision of a supply\u2010side approach to conservation (Zhong et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Ultimately, the revised WPL was criticized for its narrow definition of wildlife: it should include all wildlife species, not only endangered species under special state protection such as tiger (Panthera tigris) and rhinoceros species (Ceratotherium, Dicerorhinus, Diceros, Rhinoceros), but also all other wildlife species that are not (yet) endangered or that have already recovered (Li 2016, Xie 2016, Xu 2016). Critics further suggest that the marking permit system for protected species should be also applied to nonprotected species (including invertebrates) that are kept in captivity. Wildlife species mentioned by the revised WPL are divided into 2 categories with different protection status: wildlife under first\u2010class (special) state protection and wildlife under second\u2010class state protection (Article 10). In Article 2, it was further clarified that the law does not only apply to endangered species, but also to any other terrestrial species that has an important ecological, scientific, or social value (Wang et al. 2016a,b). However, the list appears incomplete, missing some Chinese species (e.g., the tufted deer [Elaphodus cephalophus]) and disregarding all nonnative species (EIA 2016). The revised WPL makes a clear\u2010cut differentiation between endangered species that are not permitted to be traded (i.e., all specimens from the wild) and those that are allowed to be traded as long as they are legally bred in licensed wildlife farms. Animals from the latter group must be recorded in the list of terrestrial wildlife for which artificial breeding technology was proven to be fully developed. Additionally, it should be mentioned that Article 12 clarifies to protect, restore, and improve the environments in which wildlife lives (i.e., the designation of protected areas and preservation of natural habitats).",

Moreover, 2 new articles (Articles 56, 57) were added to the revised WPL clarifying the management, storage, or disposal of seized items. As a professional standard method, all seized items must be evaluated and quarantined before being handed over to local wildlife departments for destruction or exhibition in educational institutions such as schools and museums.

Criticism on rational wildlife utilization has continuously increased during the past 26 years (coinciding with the period the previous WPL was in place), leading to a reduction of wild animal consumption and a gradual shift toward legal substitutes. No doubt, the excessive, unsustainable use of wildlife resources from the wild should be strictly prohibited, but species for which captive breeding technology as well as health and welfare standards are established should be used by humans (Kock 1995).",

            "text": "We strongly propose captive breeding as being the only feasible approach to China's wildlife conservation\u2013utilization dilemma. Moreover, we want to counteract the negative international attitude toward China's attempts to rationalize the utilization of wildlife, following successful examples from Africa and other parts of the world (see review by Hudson et al. 2010). The revision of the old WPL represents an important effort in strengthening wildlife conservation, regulating wildlife utilization, and promoting harmonious development of humans and nature in China. Despite these advances, the revised WPL still needs to address animal welfare aspects, effective law enforcement, and border controls (Li 2007, Nijman 2010, Pickett and Harris 2015). Furthermore, it would be desirable if the new WPL would advocate for more conservation awareness through improved education, public outreach, and comprehensive media coverage (Duan 2015). A constructive and progressive discussion to improve China's national standards for captive wildlife breeding (wildlife farming) is needed to further develop conservation legislation. Advancing this appeal, we forward the following suggestions:\n(1)The duties, functions, and authority of the permit\u2010issuing and law\u2010enforcing administrations must be clarified. Currently, the management and administration of some species, especially of nonnational key or alien species, remains indistinct.(2)It is imperative to strengthen the law enforcement, emphasize the illegality of harvesting wild animals in their natural habitat, and further match phrasing with international legislations.(3)The government of China ought to increase funding for the conservation of wild animals (i.e., improve and increase in situ conservation), promote scientific research on game\u2010farming species, establish a rational, independent monitoring system, and increase public awareness.(4)China's wildlife legislation should promote third\u2010party certification and monitoring by NGOs. The law should include the opportunity for regulations that supplement government legislation (e.g., NGOs and industry develop their own health and welfare standards and monitor themselves through third\u2010party guided self\u2010control).(5)The revised law should pay more attention to health and welfare standards for wildlife in captivity, including prevention of epidemics, vaccination schemes, transport, enclosure enrichment, sedation, confinement, handling, and capture.(6)China's wildlife legislation needs to ensure the correct disposal of seized items (i.e., the relentless destruction of seized items derived from protected wildlife species, except for scientific or educational purpose).\n",
