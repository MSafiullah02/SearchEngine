Similar models are also proposed to describe the spread of riots and, more generally, of collective behaviors in various social contexts. The use of epidemiology models to describe such social phenomena is based on the analogy between the mechanisms of contagion and social imitation. In turn, this analogy also points to the social nature of epidemics.",

In this paper, we propose a modeling approach on these apparently various phenomena through the example of the dynamics of social unrest. The model involves two quantities, the level of social unrest, or, more general, activity u, and a field of social tension v, which play asymmetric roles: u is thought of as the actual observed or explicit quantity while v is an ambiant, sometimes implicit field of susceptibility that modulates the growth of u.",

The new results we derive in the present paper concern the behavior of the solution far from the propagating edge, that is, we give a description of the new regime of the system following the initial surge of activity. We show in particular that the model can give rise to many diverse qualitative dynamics: ephemeral or limited-duration social movements -referred to as \"riots\" -in the tension inhibiting case, and persisting social movements -lasting upheavals -in the tension enhancing case, as well as other more complex behaviors in some mixed cases. We also investigate this model by numerical simulations that highlight the richness of this framework. We finally propose and study extensions of the model, such as spatially heterogeneous systems.",

In the current context, there is no doubt on the importance of reliable models to describe these phenomena. However, these are sometimes difficult to study empirically because of the scarcity of data and the difficulty of conducting large-scale experiments. Mathematics has a lot to offer in this field of modeling since it allow rigorous analysis, identifying the mechanisms, and testing the hypotheses through numerical experiments.",

However, most of the mathematical approaches available can hardly be generalized to a broader class of systems. Given the variety of extensions and variants of this model, it is a major challenge to propose a unified mathematical framework and to identify the core general properties of this class of system. Apart from the epidemiology context, variants of the SI model have been proposed to account for contagion in social contexts, for example, to describe the dynamics of riots and social unrest. In their pioneering work, Burbeck et al [25] write: \"Patterns within three major riots suggest that the dynamics of the spread of riot behavior during a riot can be fruitfully compared to those operative in classical epidemics. We therefore conceptualize riots as behavioral epidemics, and apply the mathematical theory of epidemics [...] .\". This approach has been adopted in many articles dealing with the modeling of riots [15, 18, 20, 22, 27, 64, 82] .",

It is therefore of particular importance to understand whether a small initial movement, called triggering event, can ignite this self-reinforcement mechanism. This involves a threshold phenomenon on an ambient level of susceptibility: typically, in a context of low susceptibility, the triggering event promptly fades out, whereas, in a context of high susceptibility, the triggering event leads to a significant movement.",

We emphasize that these two quantities play an asymmetric role: u is thought of as the actual observed or explicit quantity while v is a potential field that modulates the growth of u. From a modeling perspective, the level of activity u often represents an explicit quantity that is tractable empirically, whereas the level of susceptibility v is an implicit field. In a sense, we postulate the existence of such a field which is a lumped variable that results from several complex social interactions. Then, these two quantities interact: the field v modulates the dynamics of the activity level, and there is also a feedback mechanism whereby the level of activity influences the field of susceptibility. This is why we call this general class of systems the activity/susceptibility systems.",

In this context, the Susceptible are represented by v, and the Infected are represented by u: this illustrates well the role of potential field assumed by v -here the susceptibles. The term \u03b2uv accounts for the contagion from one individual to another. This term, which could be described as a law of mass action type term, is derived from the assumption that the contagion is proportional to the probability of encounter between a susceptible and an infected individual in a evenly mixed population. A comparable mathematical model is used to describe flame propagation in a combustion process, see [9, 14, 16] and references therein. This is a typical instance of propagation in an excitable medium. The model features the temperature (represented by u) and the chemical fuel (represented by v). In its simplest version, assuming that the reaction is adiabatic and neglecting the hydrodynamic of the medium (for example if the medium is a solid), then the model is obtained",

Section 3 is devoted to a general analysis of the model. Applying the results of [17] , we enlighten a threshold phenomenon on the initial level of social tension for the ignition of a social movement. We present some estimates on the speed of propagation of the movement and comment on the interpretation of the mathematical results in terms of modeling. Next, we focus on two important classes of models: the tension inhibiting case (Section 4), which generates ephemeral movements of social unrest, and the tension enhancing case (Section 5), which gives rise to time-persisting movements of social unrest. In both cases, we present some new results about the behavior of solutions far from the leading edge of the propagating front, as well as for traveling wave solutions. These results are corroborated by numerous numerical simulations. In Section 6, we examine several mixed cases which are neither tension inhibiting nor tension enhancing, and that exhibit more complex dynamics. Section 7 deals with extensions of the model including spatial heterogeneity. Section 8 contains all the proofs of our results. Finally, Section 9 is devoted to concluding remarks and perspectives.",

If p > 0, then a burst of u will slow down the relaxation of v; if p < 0, then a burst of u will speed up the relaxation of v. If p = 0, the system is decoupled. In [18, 20] , the cases p < 0 and p > 0 are called respectively tension enhancing and tension inhibiting, however it does not correspond to what we call tension enhancing and tension inhibiting in the present work. Let us be more precise. Assume for simplicity that v b \u2261 0 and S \u2261 0. In (2.12), the cases p > 0 and p < 0 model respectively a negative and a positive feedback of u on v. However, the fact that the term \u2212\u03b8 1 (1+u) p v is negative results in the fact that t \u2192 v(t, x) is decreasing and decays to 0, regardless of the sign of p. This implies that any burst of social unrest eventually vanishes. The behavior observed in (2.12) in both cases p > 0 and p < 0 is well captured by what we call tension inhibiting in the present work (Section 4). System (2.12) does not model a situation where a burst of social unrest results in an increase of the social tension. Yet, this case is reasonable from the modeling perspective and allows to account for time-persisting movement of social unrest (see Section 5) .",

The numerical simulation in Section 5.3.3 shows that in the general case the asymptotic speed of propagation may be different from both c b and c 1 .
