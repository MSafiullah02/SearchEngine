Phase 1 is the period of active viral replication in the myocardium during which the symptoms of myocardial damage range from none to cardiogenic shock. If the disease process continues, it enters phase 2, which is characterized by autoimmunity triggered by viral and myocardial proteins. Heart failure often appears for the first time in phase 2. Phase 3, dilated cardiomyopathy, is the end result in some patients. Diagnostic procedures and treatment should be tailored to the phase of disease. \u2022 Viral myocarditis is a significant cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, as proved by the frequent presence of viral genomic material in the myocardium, and by improvement in ventricular function by immunomodulatory therapy. \u2022 Myocarditis of any etiology usually presents with heart failure, but the second most common presentation is ventricular arrhythmia. As a result, myocarditis is one of the most common causes of sudden death in young people and others without preexisting structural heart disease. \u2022 Myocarditis can be definitively diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy. However, it is clear that existing criteria for the histologic diagnosis need to be refined, and that a variety of molecular markers in the myocardium and the circulation can be used to establish the diagnosis. \u2022 Treatment of myocarditis has been generally disappointing. Accurate staging of the disease will undoubtedly improve treatment in the future. It is clear that immunosuppression and immunomodulation are effective in some patients, especially during phase 2, but may not be as useful in phases 1 and 3. Since myocarditis is often selflimited, bridging and recovery therapy with circulatory assistance may be effective. Prevention by immunization or receptor blocking strategies is under development.",

            "text": "The difficulty of diagnosing and treating myocarditis was recognized by Senac 1 in 1772: \"The inflammation of the heart is difficult to diagnose and when we have diagnosed it, can we then treat it better?\" After Sobernheim 2 in 1837 defined myocarditis as any inflammation or degeneration of the heart, the term myocarditis was used for nonvalvular myocardial diseases, including ischemic and hypertensive cardiomyopathies. Nearly a century later, White 3 suggested that the term myocarditis be restricted to \"true inflammation of the myocardium.\" The last half-century has seen the development of endomyocardial biopsy techniques, histologic criteria, and serologic methods to diagnose myocarditis. As our knowledge of the immunopathologic mechanisms evolves, new therapeutic strategies are developing. The World Health Organization/International Society and Federation of Cardiology Task Force on Cardiomyopathies 4 classified cardiomyopathies whenever possible by etiologic/pathogenetic factors. This classification recognizes chronic viral, postinfectious autoimmune, and primary autoimmune forms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The classification states that \"myocarditis is diagnosed by established histological, immunological and immunohistochemical criteria.\" The Dallas criteria 5 provide consensus-derived histologic criteria: \"an inflammatory infiltrate of the myocardium with necrosis and/or degeneration of adjacent myocytes not typical of ischemic damage associated with coronary artery disease.\" However, many have speculated that less pronounced histologic abnormalities may be present and that additional molecular, immunologic, and immunohistochemical diagnostic criteria can be used productively. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Myocarditis, irrespective of the etiopathologic factors, remains an inflammatory cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac dysfunction.",

            "text": "A wide variety of infectious and noninfectious causes are associated with myocarditis (Tables 59.1 to 59.3) . Several epidemiologic observations linking these agents with myocarditis have been corroborated by serologic, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or in situ hybridization methods. The incidence of infectious myocarditis in the general population is largely unknown. In a prospective study 12 over several years, in a predefined subpopulation, an incidence of 0.02% was found. These cases were confirmed by myocardial enzyme leak and characteristic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. 12 The ECG abnormalities suggesting asymptomatic myocardial involvement, in the absence of enzyme release, have been noted in 1.2% of military conscripts during the course of other acute infectious diseases. 13 During an epidemic of influenza A, the incidence rose to 7.7%. 14 In a prospective trial of 2310 consecutive patients admitted to a large infectious disease hospital in Sweden, 8% showed ECG abnormalities suggestive of myocarditis. 15 Approximately 5% of a virus-infected population may experience symptoms or findings suggestive of cardiac involvement. The incidence of myocarditis associated with nonviral infections is even more difficult to estimate. Although the list of possible etiologic agents is large, the enteroviruses, specifically coxsackievirus B, over decades have been the most commonly identified etiologic agents of inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Among healthy active adults, at least 50% have detectable serum antibodies indicating prior infection with coxsackievirus B. 16, 17 The World Health Organization has surveyed viral infections related to cardiovascular disease globally. In a 10year period from 1975 to 1985, coxsackievirus B had the highest incidence of cardiovascular disease (34.6 cases per 1000 population), followed by influenza B (17.4 cases), influenza A (11.7 cases), coxsackievirus A (9.1 cases), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (8.0 cases). 18 The predominance of enteroviruses among myocarditisassociated agents has been substantiated by several laboratory and clinical studies. [19] [20] [21] Using serologic methods, Vikerfors and associates 19 reported that nearly 50% of consecutively studied myocarditis patients had enterovirus immunoglobulin IgM. Frisk and coworkers 20 found a similar incidence of coxsackievirus B IgM antibodies by reverse herpes simplex in two, and CMV in one patient. The control group did not demonstrate any viral genome sequences. Just as the incidence of specific viral infections varies over time, so should the relative proportion of agents responsible for myocarditis. In a recent study, Bowles and colleagues 22 supported the observation by Martin and coworkers 21 that adenovirus is the most common agent associated with myocarditis in children, but they also found that adenoviruses predominated over enteroviruses in adults. Figure 59 .1 shows the dominant role of adenoviruses and enteroviruses in myocarditis. Note that parvovirus was detected in young people. Parvovirus B-19 has recently been identified as a cause of myocarditis and, in some regions, it has been found in adults as well as children. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] These differences between previous and newer studies are due, at least in part, to geographical and temporal variation in the incidence of specific viral infections.",

Cardiac involvement is often characterized by the development of atrioventricular (AV) block and rarely progresses to left ventricular dysfunction and cardiomegaly. 41 Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection has also been associated with myocarditis. Lewes and coworkers 42 demonstrated asymptomatic myocardial involvement as documented by ECG changes in a third of the cases with acute Mycoplasma infection. Six percent of military conscripts with clinical myocarditis were found to have active M. pneumoniae infection. 43 Chlamydia infections have also been associated with myocarditis, especially among small children, often having fatal outcomes. 44 C. pneumoniae infection has also been noted in a few cases of mild myocarditis 45 and has been found with respiratory infection associated with myocarditis, resulting in sudden death in a young athlete. 46 Chlamydia psittaci infection may be associated with myocarditis in 5% to 15% of those affected, usually with minimal clinical signs or symptoms. 44 Pericarditis is more frequent and likely to cause cardiac morbidity with ornithosis. 47 Other Causative Infectious Agents Rickettsial infections, like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and scrub typhus, are frequently accompanied by myocardial involvement, although vasculitis is more prominent with these infections. 48 Q fever may also be associated with myocarditis. 49 Trypanosoma cruzi is a well-recognized cause of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy in South America (Chagas' disease). 50 Toxoplasma gondii poses a significant problem among cardiac transplant recipients because a large number of the recipients lack antibodies against this agent, which may cause myocarditis. 51 Toxoplasmosis also poses a major threat to patients with AIDS. Myocarditis has frequently been seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected populations with or without concomitant Toxoplasma infection. 52, 53 In two autopsy studies of patients with AIDS, myocarditis was found in almost half of the cases; in another study, 54% of 102 prospectively studied patients with AIDS had echocardiographic evidence of myocardial dysfunction. 54, 55 Myocarditis may also occur in patients with AIDS as a result of T-cell restitution after antiviral therapy. 56 Myocarditis can also be seen with parasitic infections such as Trichinella spiralis, which has an affinity for striated muscle, including the heart. 57 Other Noninfectious Causes Noninfectious causes of myocarditis include druginduced hypersensitivity, 58-89 direct toxicity of specific pharmaceutical agents, 77, [90] [91] [92] and systemic collagen vascular disorders. [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] Eosinophilic myocarditis [101] [102] [103] [104] and giant cell myocarditis (GCM) [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] are distinct forms of inflammatory myocarditis of uncertain etiology.",

A significant number of cases of myocarditis is due to autoimmune phenomena either induced by a viral infection or resulting from systemic autoimmune disease.

Clearly, multiple mechanisms exist, including direct infection by viruses, bacteria, and other organisms; noninfectious causes, such as toxins and drug hypersensitivity; and parainfectious etiologies, resulting from the immune response to infection. Most cases of overt heart failure due to myocarditis in North America, Europe, and Japan are thought to arise from the latter type of mechanism, during and after viral infection of the heart. A triphasic disease process is observed 112, 113 (Fig. 59.2A ). In the first phase, active viral infection of the myocardium results in a variable extent of muscle damage, which often may not be clinically apparent. Phase 2 develops in an unknown proportion of infected individuals after partial or complete resolution of active infection and is characterized by further myocardial damage, both by ongoing immune activation and by newly developed autoimmune activity. A small proportion of patients develops dilated cardiomyopathy, the third phase of disease, resulting from the cumulative damage caused by infection, immunity, and autoimmunity. During this phase, a considerable body of evidence suggests that the immune and autoimmune processes persist, in part as a result of viral persistence. 114 Figure 59 .2B depicts the three roles virus may play in bringing about dilatation and chronic heart failure. After the initial injury that occurs during active viral replication, latent, nonreplicating viruses can still alter myocyte function through viral genomic expression. 115 Even if the virus is completely eliminated and the immune response ceases, through the various mechanisms of adverse remodeling, the cardiomyopathy may progress inexorably.",

            "text": "The most widely accepted models for the study of human myocarditis are those of enteroviral myocarditis induced by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and the encephalomyocarditis virus. 116 Induction of chronic murine myocarditis by CVB3 requires the virus to have a cardiovirulence capacity and murine strains of certain genetic background. 117, 118 Infection of syngeneic weanling mice with CVB3 results in brief cardiac infection lasting about a week, beyond which the virus cannot be cultured. However, viral RNA persists for several months after the initial infection. 119, 120 Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the initiation of chronic inflammatory response in myocytes by the viral infection: 60. 134 Although antibodies to these antigens are frequently identified in association with myocarditis, the clinical significance and causal relationship are yet unresolved. Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) from mice with CVB3induced myocarditis possess the ability in vitro to recognize and kill neonatal myocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells infected with the same strain of the virus, 135 suggesting that the recognition of a novel tissue antigen is induced by the infection. Cross-reactive, concurrent recognition of unrelated cardiac epitopes also occurs because CTLs also lyse uninfected myocytes in vitro. 136 The production of perforin, a pore-forming protein, has been proposed as one of the mechanisms for the cytolysis induced by lymphocytes. Perforins, when inserted into myocyte membrane, induce a lethal augmentation in cell permeability that results in cellular edema and death. 137 Perforin-independent mechanisms have also been proposed, including a Fas (CD95/Apol)-based inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate-mediated cytolysis that can be demonstrated in perforin-deficient gene-knockout mice. 138 Coxsackievirus-infected mice also develop additional immune sensitization to cardiac heavy chain myosin, possibly owing to the release of the sequestered myosin antigens from the virus-damaged cells. Immunization of mice with the heavy chain myosin and an adjuvant produces a histomorphologically similar picture to CVB3-induced myocarditis. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes can also produce experimental autoimmune myocarditis after myocardial infarction in syngeneic rats. The sensitized lymphocytes when transferred to normal rats cause cardiac-specific cellular infiltration with accompanying myocyte necrosis. 139 The genetic susceptibility, kinetics, and cellular composition of the infiltrates in these models are similar and suggest the role of endogenous antigens as an epitope for the inflammatory response. 140",

            "text": "The pathways and cellular participants in the immunopathogenesis of experimental viral myocarditis are well recognized. The replicating viral particles can be readily identified in cardiac myocytes within a few hours of inoculation of CVB3 into mice. 141,142 The viral particles reach a numerical peak in 3 to 4 days, and usually at 7 to 10 days, they are no longer detectable. 143 The inflammatory infiltrate is detectable by day 5 and reaches a plateau by days 7 to 10. The early inflammatory infiltrate consists of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and the associated cytokines and humoral effectors. [144] [145] [146] The natural killer cells are the first to appear and are detected in the activated state in 3 to 4 days. These cells are capable of lysing virusinfected cells in vitro. 145 The T lymphocytes and macrophages follow the natural killer cells in the temporal sequence and become the predominant cells infiltrating the myocardium in 7 to 10 days. Although CVB3 replicates readily in myocytes in vitro, the cells are resistant to lysis in comparison with other cultured cell lines. Direct myocytolysis appears to play a minimal role in cell lines derived from normal mice. 147 The immunodeficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model has provided valuable insight into the early immune activity in response to the viral infection. The SCID mice lack mature T-and B-lymphocyte function and develop extensive myocardial necrosis with pleomorphic infiltrates, rapid viral proliferation, and profound virus-associated myocytolysis when inoculated with CVB3. 148 The macrophage and natural killer cell activity is unaffected in the SCID mouse model and may participate in the myocytolytic activity, although direct viral myocytolysis predominates. Pharmacologically immunosuppressed mice demonstrate similar characteristics, with higher viral loads, delayed clearance, and extensive myocyte necrosis, although direct viral myocytolysis is not frequent in immunocompetent mice. 143,147,149-151 Even noncardiovirulent strains may have sufficient time to replicate and transform into quasicardiovirulent species in the absence of a functional antiviral immune response, which can then result in fatal myocarditis. 152 This may also explain the clinical observation that many severe and fatal cases of myocarditis develop in young children with immature and incompletely developed immune systems. 153 Virus-specific CTLs play a major role in the inflammatory response to viral infection of the myocytc. 143,151 The inflammatory response can be diminished significantly by T-lymphocyte depletion with either antithymocyte globulin or thymectomy and irradiation. 142,154 The CTLs must recognize the foreign antigen in association with the syngeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen that is found on immune-derived cells. The CVB3-infected cells can readily express MHC class I antigens. 155 The MHC class I molecules provide peptide-binding sites that evoke effector responses on recognition of the foreign peptide by the antigenspecific receptors of the T lymphocyte. 156 However, Tlymphocyte depletion and specific immunosuppression using cyclosporine have varying effects, depending on the murine model, the virus, and the time of therapy, and are not uniformly beneficial. [157] [158] [159] The virus can no longer be cultured from cells after 7 to 10 days; however, areas of inflammatory infiltrate and myocyte necrosis do demonstrate persistence of viral RNA, and the virus-specific CTLs may continue to see these as immunologic targets and, hence, perpetuate the myocyte damage. 160 The infected myocyte can still remain a target for the CTLs, even if the viral antigens are cleared, owing to expression of \"neoantigens\" either induced by the virus or unsequestered due to the injury. 161,162 Even nonviral antigens on infected myocytes can react with CTLs, such as those induced by actinomycin D, 162 and new glycoproteins have been identified on the surface of CVB3-infected cells that can be recognized by CTLs from other syngeneic-infected mice. 163 Recent observations suggest that co-stimulatory molecules B7-1, B7-2, and CD-40 may be expressed on myocytes in patients with myocarditis and may make the myocytes into antigen-presenting cells for CTLs and natural killer cells, thereby playing an important role in the direct myocardial damage by these lytic cells. 164 ",

            "text": "Another mechanism for ongoing myocyte damage is the antibody-mediated autoimmune response. Since the majority of the proteins identified as cardiac autoantigens are intracellular, it is unclear how these antibodies could harm normal intact myocytes. Several mechanisms are proposed. One suggests that after the antibody response is initiated, the circulating antibodies to intracellular antigens crossreact with the native membrane cardiac tissue proteins. Thus, after a small number of myocytes are damaged by the viral infection and release intracellular antigens, the resulting antibody response may affect normal myocytes, leading to global myocardial dysfunction. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of a number of cross-reacting antibodies. [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] Also, the antibodies against the intracellular mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transferase protein cross-react with the myocyte sarcolemmal calcium ion channel protein, and binding of these channels can physiologically alter the metabolism and contractile function of the myocyte. 165 Another theory holds that CTLs and antibodies target uninfected myocytes by recognition of self-antigens that were previously sequestered from immune surveillance. The processing and presentation of the self-immunogenic peptides complexed with the MHC is a prerequisite for this hypothesis. Normal human cardiac myocytes do not express detectable levels of MHC class II antigens, and their constitutive expression of MHC class I molecules remains controversial. 166 A significant increase in the expression of MHC class I and class II antigens by the myocytes has been demonstrated in association with myocardial inflammation, such as that seen with viral myocarditis or transplant rejection. [167] [168] [169] The increased MHC expression has also been demonstrated in endomyocardial biopsy specimens from patients with idiopathic DCM and myocarditis, [170] [171] [172] and immune regulatory dysfunction may have a genetic predisposition. 173 There is also evidence for aberrant expression of intracellular antigens, such as adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and branched-chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD), on the surface of the myocytes. 172 The formation of antiidiotypic antibodies is an additional mechanism of immune regulation in which an antibody is formed to the idiotypic determinants (antigen recognition site) of the primary antibody. The antiidiotypic antibody may cross-react with unoccupied viral receptor sites on uninfected myocytes. This phenomenon has been reported with the reovirus, polyomavirus, and coxsackievirus B models of myocarditis. [174] [175] [176] The passive transfer of antiidiotypic B cells from a CVB3 myocarditic mouse to a syngeneic mouse can cause nonviral myocarditis. 177 ",

            "text": "Gulick and colleagues 186 demonstrated that cultured neonatal myocytes, when exposed to macrophage-derived IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1, have reduced levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and have a reduced inotropic response to catecholamines. The mechanism for decreased responsiveness to catecholamines is believed to be modulated by increases in nitric oxide production mediated by increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, and the blunting of the catecholamine response can be inhibited by the L-arginine analogue N G -monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA). 187 The decreased contractile response of cardiac myocytes to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists following induction of iNOS also requires the presence of insulin and the co-induction of enzymes responsible for the production of tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for nitric oxide synthase. 188 The role of iNOS remains controversial because increased expression of iNOS mRNA and that of other proinflammatory cytokines is evident and is associated with contractile dysfunction. 189 There is evidence to support the idea that iNOS induction is crucial for the host response to CVB3 infection, and iNOS-deficient mice have significantly increased viral loads with extensive myocardial damage. 190 Inhibition of iNOS through suppression of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB induction has recently been shown to prevent encephalomyocarditis virus myocarditis. 191 Other investigators have suggested that inflammatory cytokines may have direct negative inotropic effects, independent of the responsiveness to the \u03b2-adrenergic agonists. High doses of IL-2 during chemotherapy have been reported to result in depression of myocardial function. 89 Exposure of cardiac myocytes to endotoxin results in increased nitric oxide production and direct depression of contractility owing to increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. 192 Further, TNF-\u03b1 may induce direct negative inotropic effects by decreasing the Ca 2+ transient, with no change in the l-type Ca 2+ current and independent of nitric oxide synthesis. 193 Although the extent to which cytokines cause direct negative inotropic effects or attenuation of endogenous \u03b2-adrenergic agonist activity remains unclear, they do produce myocyte dysfunction and cardiac decompensation. Transgenic mice with overexpression of TNF-\u03b1 develop biventricular dilatation and cardiac failure, resulting in premature death. Pathologic specimens from these mice reveal globular dilated hearts and transmural myocarditis with myocyte apoptosis. 194 Increased levels of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and macrophage-stimulating factor have been demonstrated in patients with myocarditis and idiopathic DCM. 195, 196 Furthermore, the susceptibility of mice in the CVB3 myocarditis model can be increased by pretreatment with these cytokines. 197 Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 is identifiable by immunohistochemistry in the prenecrotic regions of infiltrates in the murine myocardium and decreases when the macrophages and fibroblasts migrate to the necrotic foci. These growth factors may be responsible for recruitment of the immunologic effectors and may directly affect cardiac function. 198 An intriguing feature of cytokine activity remains their possible role in the secondary development of myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, characteristic of dilated cardiomyopathy. 199 Among animals with different forms of viral myocarditis associated with similar intensity of initial myocyte necrosis, only those animals with persistent inflammation develop interstitial fibrosis, reflected by fibroblast proliferation and an increase in the extracellular matrix. Myocardial fibrosis correlates well with the presence of T lymphocytes and macrophages, which in their activated state release fibrogenic cytokines such as fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-\u03b2. 200 Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their inhibitors, are thought to play a critical role in the process of myocardial remodeling. Some of the cytokines elaborated during the course of viral myocarditis, such as TNF-\u03b1, disturb the balance between MMPs and their inhibitors by increasing MMP, leading to failure of collagen cross-linking and worsened ventricular function ( Fig. 59.3 ). 201 This pathophysiology may present opportunities for prevention of the development of dilated cardiomyopathy resulting from myocarditis.",

This association clearly exists in humans, but the proportion of cases that can be accounted for by viral infection is not known. The myocardial damage in murine models of viral myocarditis occurs in two distinct phases: an early phase of direct viral cytotoxicity in which virusspecific T-lymphocyte-and antibody-mediated cytotoxicity predominate; and a late or chronic phase in which the persistent viral genome, reactive CTLs, autoantibodies, cytokines, and microvascular damage mediate myocyte damage and dysfunction. The hypothetical mechanisms of virusinduced autoimmune heart disease are presented in Figures 59.2 to 59.4. The recognition that immune responses to specific viruses are consequential in the development of myocyte injury has led to exhaustive research to exploit the possibility of designing immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies. The pretreatment of mice with inactivated virus vaccine prevents the manifestations of encephalomyocarditis virus myocarditis. 202 The administration of antiviral therapies reduces the viral load and attenuates the histologic findings of myocarditis. 203, 204 The antiviral response can be augmented by IFN-\u03b1 or the exogenous administration of IL-6. 205, 206 Recombinant murine IFN-\u03b3 has also been demonstrated to improve the prognosis of acute murine myocarditis caused by encephalomyocarditis virus by suppressing replication. 207 The murine model has also been the subject of intensive study with clinically applied immunosuppressants, such as corticosteroids, 208 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, 209, 210 and cyclophosphamide, 211 all of which have demonstrated deleterious effects when given in the acute viremic phase. Cyclosporine, when administered in the early viremic phase, worsens myocardial injury but, in the late immune phase, has a beneficial effect. 157,158, 212 Similar results have been reported with tacrolimus, 213 and survival improves significantly when immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, and 15-deoxyspergualin are used in adjunct to immunomodulators, such as IFN-\u03b1. 214 Antibodies to TNF-\u03b1 have been demonstrated to improve survival and reduce myocardial injury. 215 Cytokine inhibitors have had promising results in animal models, but human clinical trials have been inconsistent. Vesnarinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, has demonstrated beneficial hemodynamic effects and inhibits the production of TNF-\u03b1 and favorably modulates induction of iNOS. 216 Amlodipine has also been shown to increase survival of mice with viral myocarditis by inhibiting expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide in vivo and in vitro. 217 ",

Cardiotropic viruses may cause pericardial inflammation, and patients often present with a syndrome of myopericarditis. Chest pain is the most common symptom and is secondary to pericarditis or myocardial injury. 221 A rather dramatic presentation of myocarditis is one indistinguishable from an acute myocardial infarction, complete with chest pain, ECG features suggesting acute ischemic injury, enzymatic evidence of myocardial damage, and echocardiographic or ventriculographic regional wall motion abnormalities, but on endomyocardial biopsy myocarditis is confirmed. [222] [223] [224] Most patients presenting with this acute syndrome completely recover, although there are isolated instances where progressive myocyte loss and cardiac failure or sudden arrhythmic death is reported. 225 The segmental wall motion abnormalities result from virus-mediated injury, although local coronary arteritis and vasospasm have been suggested as possible culprits. 226, 227 Symptoms of right and left ventricular failure and even cardiogenic shock are frequently found in patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis, since it is these symptoms that lead to medical attention. However, the true incidence of heart failure in patients with myocarditis is probably much lower. In patients presenting with recent-onset heart failure and biopsy-proven myocarditis, 50% to 60% have had an antecedent flu-like illness. 225 Neonatal myocarditis is often a fulminant syndrome consisting of fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, cyanosis, and rapid progression to circulatory collapse. 228 Mortality rates are the highest in this subpopulation, approaching 50%. Children are known to present with syncope due to heart block. 229 Other atrial arrhythmias described with myocarditis include sinoatrial block, atrial standstill, AV block, intraatrial conduction abnormalities, atrial tachycardia, flutter, and fibrillation. [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] [235] Histologic evidence of possible myocarditis has been described in up to two thirds of patients with lone atrial fibrillation. 236 Complete heart block has also been described in certain viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus or mumps, and also with rickettsiae. [237] [238] [239] Myocarditis may also manifest as myocardial thickening and fibrosis presenting as diastolic dysfunction or restrictive cardiomyopathy, and asymmetric septal thickening resembling hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. [240] [241] [242] Lieberman and coworkers 243 proposed a clinicopathologic description of myocarditis based on the initial manifestations, endomyocardial biopsy, and recovery (fulminant, acute, chronic active, or chronic persistent myocarditis).",

            "text": "Ventricular arrhythmias are frequently encountered in patients with myocarditis, ranging from innocuous premature ventricular contractions to malignant and incessant ventricular tachycardia, and myocarditis is often incriminated in otherwise unexplained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. 10, Myocarditis has been documented as a cause of ventricular repolarization abnormalities in athletes with or without arrhythmias. 247, 248 Ventricular arrhythmias may also be precursors to sudden cardiac death in young athletes with occult myocarditis. 249 In autopsy series, myocarditis accounts for 10% to 25% of sudden deaths in young, healthy people. 250, 252, 266, 267 In a population-based retrospective study from Turin, Italy, an incidence of only 0.53% was reported among 17,162 autopsies performed over three decades, 253 but the application of standardized systematic histologic examination and criteria tends to give a higher incidence, in the range of 5%, among autopsies performed at a general hospital. 254 Wesslen and associates 255 reported signs of active, healing, or healed myocarditis in 12 of 16 cases of sudden death in young Swedes. Among high-performance athletes, sudden death due to undiagnosed myocarditis often stirs media attention. 256 Myocarditis has also been anecdotally implicated in sudden infant death syndrome. 257 Ventricular arrhythmias are frequently the initial and most prominent presentation of giant cell myocarditis. [107] [108] [109] [110] 251, 270 Ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death are common in all forms of myocardial failure, but specific immunemediator-induced effects on myocyte electrophysiology could also account for a portion of these arrhythmias. Binah 271 summarized a number of the mechanisms recognized by work in his laboratory and in others. As noted above, perforin elaborated by CTLs is capable of forming membrane channels that pass charged ions, resulting in action potential shortening and diastolic oscillations. 272 In addition, Fas ligand can lengthen the action potential and induce afterpotentials, in part through inhibiting I to and augmenting I CaL . 273 ",

            "text": "Myocarditis, although associated with myocyte damage and necrosis, results in CK-MB elevation in only 12% of patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis. 279 More recently, Lauer and colleagues 280 reported on CK-MB elevation in only one of fi ve patients with histologic evidence of myocarditis, but cardiac troponin T (cTnT), which is extremely specific for myocardial damage, was elevated in all five. Additionally, cTnT was elevated in 28 patients, of whom 26 had immunohistologic evidence of myocarditis. Thus, cTnT elevation appears to be highly predictive for myocarditis. 280 In an analysis of stored sera on 88 patients from the MTT, 276 cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was elevated in 34% of patients (18 of 53) with myocarditis, compared with 11% (4 of 35) without myocarditis. In contrast, CK-MB values were elevated in only 5.7% of patients (3 of 53) with myocarditis. Further, the cTnI elevations correlated with less than 1 month's duration of heart failure symptoms. 276 Antibodies to cardiac antigens can be detected in the serum of patients with myocarditis. 126,281,282 Anti-\u03b1-myosin IgG antibodies may have promise as a diagnostic tool, and, along with other antibodies, probably play a functional role. 283, 284 The clinical efficacy of IgG immunoadsorption 285, 286 in DCM supports this notion (see also Fig. 59.6 ).",

            "text": "Historically, acute myocarditis was diagnosed with the constellation of clinical symptoms, physical signs, and ECG abnormalities. Although no particular feature on the electrocardiogram is pathognomonic of acute myocarditis, sinus tachycardia, repolarization abnormalities, conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias are common findings. In a series of 45 patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis, Morgera and associates 287 noted an abnormal QRS duration in 45%; abnormal Q waves in 18%; left bundle branch block (LBBB) and right bundle branch block (RBBB) patterns in 18% and 13%, respectively; ST elevation in 16%; T-wave inversions in 16%; and advanced AV block in 16%. In patients presenting earlier in the course of the disease, with symptoms of less than 1 month's duration, 31% had advanced AV block and 47% had ST elevation with T-wave inversions. The latter finding has been noted to portend a poorer prognosis. Other predictors of poor outcome include LBBB, RBBB, and other conduction abnormalities, which seem to suggest active, severe, and extensive myocarditis. 288 Patients may present with sustained ventricular tachycardia, and continuous ECG monitoring of patients with myocarditis often reveals complex ventricular ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. 245, 289 Echocardiography is useful in assessing the extent of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which may range from mild segmental hypokinesis to severe global hypokinesis or akinesis associated with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). 290 Patients presenting with chest pain or arrhythmias without CHF often have normal echocardiograms. The ventricular dimensions may remain normal or may be only mildly enlarged. There may be an increase in left ventricular sphericity and right ventricular elongation and an increase in wall thickness and left ventricular mass with the interstitial edema and compensatory hypertrophy. 241, 291 Restrictive filling patterns in the left ventricle identifying diastolic dys-function have been reported consistently in biopsy-proven myocarditis. 241 Mural thrombi in diffusely hypokinetic ventricles have been reported frequently. 292 Hyperrefractile myocardium and other qualitative and quantitative analyses of myocardial texture have been described to assess the degree of active myocardial inflammation. 293 Pericardial effusion is a helpful echocardiographic finding, reported in 10% of patients with myocarditis, though hemodynamic compromise with cardiac tamponade is infrequent. 293 Urhausen and associates 294 recently demonstrated that cardiac tissue velocity imaging by ultrasound is more sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in some cases in detecting myocarditis with subtle ventricular functional impairment. Imaging of leukocyte-mediated inflammation through ultrasound fracture of phagocytosed microbubbles shows promise as a means for detecting many forms of myocardial inflammation, although the method remains to be fully evaluated in humans. 295 Cardiac scintigraphy has been proposed as a convenient, noninvasive test with high sensitivity to diagnose active myocarditis. Gallium-67 imaging, which identifies areas of increased inflammation, has been studied in clinical settings and noted to have sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 86%, respectively, with a negative predictive value of 98% for the diagnosis of myocarditis. 296 Indium-111 antimyosin monoclonal antibodies have been extensively studied to identify areas of myocyte damage in acute myocarditis. 297, 298 This technique has extremely high sensitivity and often detects myocarditis that, on endomyocardial biopsy, is not seen by routine histologic assessment but is detected by immunohistochemistry. 299 Dec and coworkers 300 studied 74 patients with DCM with radiolabeled antimyosin antibody and endomyocardial biopsy. Thirty-nine patients had abnormal antimyosin scans, but only 11 of 39 had evidence of myocarditis (predictive value of 33%). However, functional improvement was more likely in antimyosin scan-positive patients irrespective of the biopsy. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved significantly in both concordant-positive (scan and biopsy both positive) and discordant-positive (scan positive, biopsy negative) patients, but it did not markedly improve in the negative scan and negative biopsy subset. The investigators proposed that discordant-positive scans represented patients with myocarditis in whom there may have been a sampling error on biopsy, hence the reason for missing the diagnosis. 300 Anastasiou-Nana's group 301 in Athens reported that a combination of minimal or no left ventricular dilatation and a positive indium-111 antimyosin monoclonal antibody scan is highly specific for myocarditis. Other nuclear techniques, such as technetium-99m ( 99m Tc)-MIBI single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, 302 may also be useful in detecting myocarditis.",

            "text": "The antemortem diagnosis of myocarditis was made feasible by the development of the endomyocardial biopsy technique. Myocardial samples could be obtained via a transvascular approach with minimal discomfort to the patient and a low complication rate. Whereas other approaches for acquiring myocardial tissue included percutaneous biopsy and mediastinotomy, 307,308 these were fraught with complications, precluding their acceptance into clinical practice. The safe and successful transvascular endomyocardial biopsy first described by Sakakibara and Konno 309 was readily accepted for surveillance of cardiac allograft rejection in transplant recipients. The use of endomyocardial biopsy for the diagnosis and management of myocarditis was first reported in 1980. 310 Subsequently, many reports 170, 225, 243, [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] [263] [264] 269, [311] [312] [313] [314] [315] [316] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321] [322] [323] [324] [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] documented myocarditis in patients presenting with unexplained heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias (Table 59 .4). However, there was considerable incongruity in the diagnostic criteria used in these largely anecdotal reports. The Dallas criteria were developed in preparation for a large, randomized, multicenter clinical trial of immunosuppressive therapy in myocarditis. 330 These criteria define active myocarditis (see also Fig. 59 .7A) as \"an inflammatory infiltrate of the myocardium with necrosis and/or degeneration of adjacent myocytes not typical of ischemic damage associated with coronary artery disease.\" Furthermore, other causes of inflammation (e.g., connective tissue disorders, infection, drugs) should be excluded. 5, 330 The Dallas criteria also defined borderline myocarditis as an inflammatory infiltrate that is sparse and lacks myocyte injury, and often (67%) on repeat biopsy, borderline myocarditis will histologically progress to active myocarditis. 331 A limitation of endomyocardial biopsy is possible sampling error. The inflammation in myocarditis may be patchy or focal, unlike allograft rejection, which is a relatively diffuse process. Although obtaining four samples from the right ventricular septum provides a high sensitivity for detection of allograft rejection in transplant recipients, 332 this may not hold true for myocarditis. In an autopsy study of the right ventricular biopsy technique (10 samples taken from the apical septum), only six of 11 patients dying of myocarditis were correctly identified. Left ventricular biopsy missed the diagnosis in eight of 11. 333 In another study using the standard four to six samples, the sensitivity of right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy was reported at 50%. 334 Dec and colleagues 331 reported that employing repeat left and right ventricular biopsies in patients with suspected myocarditis with an initial negative biopsy increases the yield by 15%. Because an ideal study to evaluate sampling error has not been done, the true yield is unknown, but clearly a negative biopsy does not exclude active myocarditis. In the MTT, only 9% of patients screened had histologic evidence of myocarditis. The European Study of Epidemiology and Treatment of Cardiac Inflammatory Disease (ESETCID) 7 demonstrated a 20% incidence of biopsy-proven myocarditis by expanding the Dallas criteria with the use of newer techniques of PCR and in situ hybridization. As discussed earlier, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] there is a need for validation of new histologic and nonhistologic criteria for diagnosis of this disease to improve upon the Dallas histologic criteria.",

Isolation of infectious virus from the heart has been achieved in only a few cases of acute fulminant myocarditis in neonates and infants. 21, 339 Given the hypothesis that DCM may develop after viral infection has been eradicated, the presence of virus in the myocardium is neither sufficient nor necessary to link virally mediated myocarditis with DCM. The indirect evidence of viral etiology of DCM relies on (1) progression of viral myocarditis to DCM in experimental animal models, (2) apparent progression of myocarditis in some patients to DCM, (3) increased enteroviral antibody titers in patients with DCM, (4) presence of viral genomic material in the myocardial tissue of patients with DCM, and (5) improvement of ventricular function in subjects with DCM receiving immunomodulatory treatments. The major limitations are as follows: the relevance of disease in mice to humans is suspect, most cases of DCM are not preceded by documented myocarditis, and epidemiologic serologic evidence is incomplete. Whereas coxsackievirus B IgM antibodies are detected with greater frequency in patients with DCM than in normal controls, the frequency is similar to matched community controls and household contacts. 287, 340 Enteroviral genomic sequences are detected in the myocardium of 8% to 70% of patients with active myocarditis and in 0% to 45% of patients with DCM, but in data derived from most published studies, the average detection frequencies are 25% for active myocarditis, 15% for DCM, and not significantly different from 15% among healthy controls. 288, 341 In a metaanalysis of the association of enteroviruses with human heart disease, Baboonian and Treasure 342 concluded that although the causative role of enteroviruses in acute myocarditis, particularly in children, was supported by an overall odds ratio of 4.4 [confidence interval (CI), 2.4 to 8.2], and the association of DCM was suggested by an overall odds ratio of 3.8 (CI, 2.1 to 4.6), six of 17 studies did not demonstrate an increased presence of viral remnants. The same investigators demonstrated more recently that PCR positivity is not found in minimally affected first-degree relatives of patients with familial DCM, 343 suggesting that in this group, genetic predisposition to viral myocarditis does not underlie the inherited predisposition to development of DCM. In recent studies, other investigators have found strong evidence for a viral link, 344 while others have found no viral vestiges in the myocardium of patients with end-stage heart failure. 345, 346 Regional variation in the etiology of DCM may be responsible in part for the reported differences in PCR positivity.",

Efficacy of such interventions has been reported in carefully selected patients. 285, 286, [347] [348] [349] Although the link between myocarditis and DCM is unclear, certain prognostic factors are identifiable. The presence of an abnormal QRS complex on ECG correlates with more severe left ventricular damage and is an independent predictor of survival. Left atrial enlargement, atrial fibrillation, and LBBB are also associated with increased mortality. 287 Higher baseline LVEF is positively associated with survival, whereas intensity of conventional therapy at baseline is negatively associated with survival. 274 The presence of right ventricular dysfunction, as evidenced by abnormal right ventricular systolic shortening on echocardiography, was shown to be the most important predictor of death or need for cardiac transplantation in a group of 23 patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis who were followed longterm. 291 In addition, a net increase in LVEF (between initial and final ejection fraction) was associated with improved survival, whereas baseline ejection fraction was not predictive of outcome. The presence and degree of left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities did not affect the clinical course. 291 Light microscopic findings on biopsy have not been found to predict outcome in myocarditis. However, the extent of myocardial inflammation was a predictor of outcome after surgical ventricular remodeling for heart failure. 350 Higher baseline serum antibodies to cardiac IgG by indirect immunofluorescence was associated with a better LVEF and a smaller left ventricular end-diastolic dimension. 274",

Although the data from clinical trials of antiarrhythmic therapy in heart failure have not shown a primary mortality benefit, patients with active myocarditis were excluded in these trials. Since immunosuppression is probably not helpful in myocarditis 274 and no other specific therapy is available, one might consider treating the arrhythmias in the usual fashion, but there appears to be a rationale for making the diagnosis of myocarditis in patients who do not have profound ventricular dysfunction along with their arrhythmia. First, the majority of patients with myocarditis have a spontaneous resolution. Second, current antiarrhythmic therapy of ventricular tachyarrhythmias is exacting, involving electrophysiologic studies and use of potentially toxic drugs or implantable defibrillators. The benefit of making the diagno-sis of myocarditis is that the patient may require only shortterm protection while the underlying process resolves, which can be provided by using amiodarone or other antiarrhythmic drugs under inpatient monitoring. If myocarditis resolves, antiarrhythmic therapy can be withdrawn. Patients whose arrhythmias fail to improve despite histologic resolution of myocarditis, or who survived cardiac arrest, may be candidates for aggressive electrophysiologic approaches and implantable defibrillators. 244 Temporary and permanent pacemakers may be required in patients presenting with conduction system abnormalities.",

Gagliardi and coworkers 360 followed 20 children with biopsy-proven myocarditis who were treated with cyclosporine and prednisone. At 1 year, 10 of 20 patients still had histologic evidence of myocarditis. No patient died or required transplantation. However, there was no control group. The data supporting an immunologic basis of myocarditis resulted in multiple treatment trials using immunosuppressants (Table 59 .5). The average proportion of patients showing improvement with a variety of immunosuppressants was 54%. 361 A large number of the trials predated the development of the Dallas criteria; thus, the histologic definition of myocarditis was not uniform. Immunosuppressive regimens were arbitrary, and the lack of control groups made interpretation of these trials arduous. It was unclear whether immunosuppression was beneficial in those patients with myocarditis, as they can improve spontaneously. Further, the infectious complications of immunosuppression were frequently seen and occasionally reported. 310, 362 The conflicting results from these nonrandomized observations led to the MTT. 274 In a multicenter, prospective, randomized design, the MTT enrolled patients with heart failure of recent onset (<2 years), left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF <45%), and biopsy-proven myocarditis (per the Dallas criteria). The study screened 2333 patients; 214 (9%) had endomyocardial biopsy evidence of myocarditis, and 111 patients had a qualifying LVEF of less than 45% and agreed to enrollment. Patients were randomized to three treatment arms: prednisone and cyclosporine, prednisone and azathioprine, and no immunosuppressant treatment. All patients received conventional therapy for heart failure. The prednisone and azathioprine group was subsequently eliminated owing to low patient recruitment in the trial. Patients were treated for 24 weeks, and the primary end point was comparison of the mean increase in LVEF at 28 weeks. Secondary analysis of other markers of left ventricular function, survival, and several immune parameters was performed. At both 28 and 52 weeks, no difference in LVEF was observed in immunosuppressive-treated patients compared with untreated patients. At 1 and 5 years, there was no difference in survival or need for cardiac transplantation between groups (Fig. 59.5) . On multivariate analysis, better baseline LVEF, less intensive conventional therapy, and shorter illness duration were independent predictors of improvement in LVEF during follow-up. Analysis of immunologic variables (cardiac IgG, circulating IgG, natural killer and macrophage activity, helper T-cell level) suggested an association between better outcome and a more robust immune response. A higher level of cardiac IgG was associated with a higher LVEF and a smaller left ventricular size. The mortality rate for the entire trial was 20% at 1 year and 56% at 4.3 years. The results of the MTT were important for diagnostic management because the authors recommended that in patients with unexplained CHF, the performance of endomyocardial biopsy for the sole purpose of instituting immunosuppressive therapy was not warranted.",

The ESETCID 7,367 is a prospective multicenter, placebocontrolled, double-blind study intended to address the natural course of myocarditis, myopericarditis, pericarditis, and The treatment regimens include conventional therapy with diuretics, ACEIs, digoxin, and antiarrhythmics or defibrillators; specific therapy for CMV and enteroviral myocarditis; and prednisolone and azathioprine for myocarditis without detectable virus. The duration of blinded therapy is 6 months, with follow-up for 24 months. The possible utility of more flexible diagnostic criteria for identification of responders to immunosuppressive therapy was recently suggested in a retrospective analysis by Frustaci and colleagues. 10 They found that the patients who had improved with immunosuppression had detectible circulating cardiac-specific autoantibodies but no detectible viral genomic material in their myocardium, while nonresponders had the opposite findings. These observations could be explained by successful suppression of an autoimmune response without the liability of suppressing ongoing antiviral immune activity.",

            "text": "The advances in treatment strategies for HIV-infected patients have successfully resulted in prolonged survival times, and noninfectious complications of AIDS, such as dementia and heart disease, have become increasingly prevalent. Early in the history of the AIDS epidemic, reports emerged of a rapidly fatal DCM affecting HIV-infected patients. 385, 386 Since the early reports, several clinical and echocardiographic series 56, [387] [388] [389] [390] [391] have suggested that a subgroup of HIV-infected patients are predisposed to the development of progressive heart disease. In a prospective echocardiographic survey of 296 HIV-infected adults over a period of 4 years, 44 patients were found to have significant cardiac dysfunction. Dilated cardiomyopathy occurred in 13 of 44 and was strongly associated with a CD4 count of less than 100/mm 3 and poorer survival. 391 It has been estimated that clinically significant cardiac disease occurs in 6% to 7% of HIV-seropositive individuals. 392 An interesting hypothesis to explain the high frequency of dilated heart muscle disease is the presence of myocarditis in HIV-infected patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Reilly and colleagues 393 reported in an autopsy series of 58 consecutive AIDS patients a significantly higher incidence of myocarditis in those with clinically apparent cardiac disease or DCM. There have been other reports of higher prevalence of myocarditis in an endomyocardial biopsy series of HIV-seropositive patients compared with those without risk factors for HIV who were biopsied for suspected myocarditis. 394 Human immunodeficiency virus-related myocarditis has unique and atypical immunopathogenic features. It is characterized by increased CD8 T lymphocytes and sole induction of MHC class I, perhaps as a part of the systemic depletion of CD4 T cells. The myocarditis may not be readily apparent on histology owing to the accompanying lymphopenia, and special immunohistology and histochemistry techniques may need to be employed. 395 Although in situ hybridization techniques have demonstrated HIV-1 transcripts in cardiac myocytes, interstitial dendritic cells, and endothelial cells, the pathologic significance of this finding is still unclear because patients with evident transcripts may or may not have clinical disease. Also, it is not evident that myocyte injury is a result of direct cytotoxicity of the virus, transcripts, cytokines, or other cardiotropic viruses. 396 A large number of HIV-seropositive patients with left ventricular dysfunction also manifest evidence of nonpermissive or latent infection of myocytes with CMV immediate-early (CMV IE-2) genes. Although evidence for classic intranuclear inclusions of active lytic CMV infection is rarely found, there is increasing speculation that the latent viral infection may be responsible for enhanced MHC expression and provide a stimulus for ongoing immune injury, as seen with most models of myocarditis. 397 A role for direct cytokine-mediated cardiac injury has also been proposed in HIV-infected populations with myocardial dysfunction. Both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, known to be elevated in HIV infection, directly inhibit cardiac contractility in vitro, 368 and the former has been implicated in causing myocardial dysfunction. Increased catecholamines may be responsible for microvascular spasm and chronic ischemic dysfunction.",

Its incidence varied with the vaccinia strain used to produce the vaccine, and with the method used to detect myocarditis. The true incidence is not known. Current vaccination programs use the original New York City Board of Health strain of vaccinia (Dryvax) and new vaccines.

            "text": "Although vaccination has virtually eliminated diphtheria in most Western nations, it remains an important public health problem in many underdeveloped countries, 413 and may be the most common etiology of myocarditis worldwide. Infection with C. diphtheriae is usually confined to the respiratory mucosa. Systemic manifestations are due to secretion of a potent exotoxin. The ECG abnormalities suggesting myocardial involvement are present in a high proportion of patients, 414 but clinical evidence of cardiac dysfunction occurs in only 10% to 25% of cases. Nevertheless, cardiac involvement is the most common cause of death in fatal infections. 415 Disturbances of AV conduction, including bundle branch blocks and complete AV block, are observed frequently in affected patients and are associated with a mortality rate of 60% to 90%. Patients may also present with progressive cardiac dilatation and CHF. Histologic study reveals diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrates associated with myocyte necrosis. 416 Corticosteroid therapy does not appear to be effective in the prevention or treatment of diphtheritic myocarditis, although only one prospective trial has been performed. 417 One report suggested that administration of carnitine may decrease the incidence and severity of cardiac involvement. 418 Spirochetal Myocardial Disease LYME DISEASE Lyme disease is caused by the spirochetal organism B. burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans by certain species of deer ticks in endemic areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. The acute phase of the illness is characterized by fever, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, and a characteristic rash known as erythema chronicum migrans. 419 The organism persists in many tissues, and chronic manifestations include arthritis and a variety of neurologic syndromes. Manifestations of cardiac involvement develop in 4% to 10% of patients at an average of 4.8 weeks (range, 4 days to 7 months) after the acute illness. 41, 420, 421 Disturbances of AV conduction are the most common manifestations, occurring in 87% of cases, with complete or high-grade block in more than 50%. The AV block is usually supra-Hisian, with a narrow complex escape rhythm. 422 Temporary transvenous pacing is required frequently, but AV block almost always resolves within 7 to 10 days. Endomyocardial biopsy may reveal lymphocytic infiltrates with associated myocyte necrosis, 422 and spirochetes may be identified in biopsy specimens. Lyme carditis occasionally develops in patients without a preceding rash or other symptoms of acute Lyme disease. 423 Therapy with a 2 to 3 week course of antibiotics (doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime) is recommended for patients with Lyme carditis. 420, 421 Antibiotic therapy has proved effective in the prevention and treatment of chronic arthritic and neurologic syndromes, but its use in cardiac disease has not been tested prospectively. Evidence of diffuse myocardial involvement is common, including evolving STsegment and T-wave abnormalities on the electrocardiogram, reversible abnormalities of left ventricular wall motion, 420 and diffuse myocardial uptake on gallium scan. 422 One fatal case of pancarditis has been reported, but frank heart failure is uncommon.",

Histologic examination in these cases demonstrates inflammatory infiltrates adjacent to myocytes containing large numbers of intracellular parasites. These findings suggest that cardiac manifestations during the acute phase of the illness may be due to direct lysis of myocytes by parasites. 448, 449 The acute illness resolves over a period of weeks to months, and patients enter the indeterminate phase. These patients are asymptomatic, with low-level parasitemia, and antibodies to T. cruzi are present. Although the electrocardiogram is normal, echocardiography and left ventricular cineangiography demonstrate focal wall motion abnormalities in a high proportion of cases, most commonly involving the left ventricular apex and posterior wall. Endomyocardial biopsy is frequently normal but may reveal hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammatory infiltrates in up to 37% of patients without clinical manifestations. 450 Manifestations of chronic Chagas' disease develop in 30% to 70% of infected patients after a highly variable period, which may be as long as 50 years. 445, 449 Involvement of autonomic ganglia may cause megacolon or megaesophagus, but the heart is the organ most commonly affected. Histology is characterized by focal areas of inflammation or fibrosis interspersed with areas of normal myocardium. Endomyo-cardial biopsy reveals myocarditis in approximately 60% of patients. 451, 452 This process frequently involves the specialized conducting tissue, and therefore disturbances of AV conduction, especially RBBB with or without associated left anterior fascicular block, are present in up to 60% of patients. Complete heart block may require permanent transvenous pacing. Ventricular arrhythmias are also frequent, and the initial manifestation of the disease may be sudden death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia or complete heart block. Decreased ventricular function is present in almost all patients with chronic Chagas' disease, and in its most advanced form, Chagas' disease presents as a congestive cardiomyopathy with four-chamber dilatation. A characteristic apical aneurysm is usually present. [453] [454] [455] Left ventricular thrombus is frequently observed, and systemic embolization is common. 456, 457 This advanced form of the disease is usually fatal within a few years.",

Parasites are usually not detected in the myocardium, but low-level parasitemia can be demonstrated by hemoculture or xenodiagnosis, using uninfected reduviid bugs allowed to ingest the patient's blood. 446 The pathogenic mechanisms leading to myocardial injury, in some patients occurring many years after the initial infection, are poorly understood. The presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the absence of detectable parasites suggests the possibility of autoimmune injury, as postulated for viral and idiopathic myocarditis. Support for this hypothesis includes the demonstration of antibodies to T. cruzi as well as antiidiotypic antibodies that cross-react with myocyte antigens. 458, 459 Histologic studies demonstrate loss of autonomic ganglia, and physiologic studies are suggestive of marked autonomic dysfunction. [460] [461] [462] Withdrawal of parasympathetic tone may lead to excess sympathetic stimulation, which can cause cardiomyopathy. Histologic studies also demonstrate abnormalities of the microvascular bed, 447, 463 and in vitro experiments demonstrate altered endothelial cell function and increased platelet-endothelial cell adhesion. 447, 464 All three reports suggest that progressive focal myocardial disease is the result of ischemia due to obstruction of the microvascular bed.",

Both nifurtimox and benznidazole decrease the level and duration of parasitemia and decrease mortality in patients with acute Chagas' disease. 446 Low-level parasitemia persists in most treated patients, however, and it is unclear whether therapy in the acute phase decreases the incidence of subsequent progression to chronic Chagas' disease. Whereas earlier studies with these drugs have not been shown to decrease progression from latent phase to chronic disease or to decrease symptoms or improve cardiac function in patients with chronic disease, 446, 447 the recent studies with itraconazole and allopurinol have shown partial success with parasitologic cure and normalization of ECG changes in nearly half the patients. 465 In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of benznidazole, there was successful negative seroconversion of 55% of patients with early chronic disease as manifested by seropositivity for T. cruzispecific antibodies after treatment for 60 days. 466 Immunosuppressive therapy in patients with malignancies or after organ transplantation has been associated with reactivation causing acute Chagas' disease. 467, 468 Reactivation of Chagas' disease in this setting has usually responded promptly to therapy. [469] [470] [471] AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS African trypanosomiasis is caused by Trypanosoma gambiense or T. rhodanese and characteristically presents with progressive somnolence owing to central nervous system involvement. Autopsy studies demonstrate a pancarditis involving the mural and valvular endocardium as well as the myocardium in up to 50% of fatal cases. [472] [473] [474] [475] The conduction system and autonomic ganglia may also be involved. Nonspecific abnormalities are often present on the electrocardiogram, but other clinical manifestations of the frequent cardiac involvement are apparently uncommon.",

It is widely believed to have an infectious etiology, but no agent has yet been identified. Its diagnosis is based on recognition of clinical features of the illness, which include remittent high-spiking fever with distinctive conjunctival injection, anterior uveitis, strawberry tongue with erythema, dryness, fissuring and peeling of the lips and mouth, erythematous truncal rash, redness of palms and soles with periungual desquamation, and cervical lymphadenopathy. 489 The principal cardiovascular manifestation of the disease is a multisystem arteritis with frequent involvement of the coronary arteries. 490 Coronary arteritis leads to aneurysm formation and thrombosis. The most common cause of death is myocardial infarction due to aneurysm rupture or coronary occlusion. Myocardium obtained by endomyocardial biopsy or at autopsy reveals histologic evidence of myocarditis in a high proportion of patients.

            "text": "Giant cell myocarditis is a rare but frequently fatal disorder. It is defined histologically by extensive but patchy myocyte necrosis with areas of intense multicellular inflammatory infiltration that includes histiocytes, lymphocytes, and the characteristic multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 59.7B) . 105, [497] [498] [499] There has been a great deal of controversy as to whether GCM and cardiac sarcoidosis are distinct pathologic entities because multinucleated giant cells in GCM seldom organize to form granulomas. 107,500,501 Litovsky and associates 501 showed that GCM is characterized by myocytic destruction mediated by cytotoxic T cells, macrophagic giant cells, and eosinophils. In contrast, cardiac sarcoid is an interstitial granulomatous disease without myocytic necrosis. 270 Although the etiology of GCM is unknown, it has been associated with a medley of autoimmune disorders and perhaps is immunologically mediated. Thymomas, systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, ulcerative colitis, chronic hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, myositis, pernicious anemia, Takayasu's arteritis, and lymphomas have been associated with GCM. [502] [503] [504] [505] [506] [507] [508] [509] The clinical presentation of GCM may mimic lymphocytic myocarditis, although arrhythmias and heart failure are usually more severe and rapidly progressive. 510, 511 Frequently, patients with GCM present with conduction system abnormalities, ventricular tachycardia, or even sudden cardiac death. [107] [108] [109] [110] 251, 270, 502, 512, 513 Giant cell myocarditis has also been reported to present as asymmetric septal hypertrophy. 512 The natural history of GCM is obscure owing to its rare occurrence, but the isolated reports in the literature suggest that it carries a poor prognosis. Davidoff and coworkers 110 reported that 70% of patients with GCM required cardiac transplantation or died during a 4-year follow-up period compared with the 29% of patients with lymphocytic myocarditis. Cooper and colleagues 108 reported on 63 patients with GCM collected in a worldwide registry. The registry patients had an 89% rate of death or need for transplantation, which was significantly worse than that for the 111 patients with lymphocytic myocarditis seen in the MTT. The median survival with GCM was 5.5 months. The patients treated with immunosuppressive regimens including cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone had an average cardiac survival of 12.3 months compared with 3.0 months for the untreated patients. The rate of recurrent GCM in the transplanted patients was 25% (nine of 36).",

Endomyocardial biopsy is essential to the antemortem diagnosis of eosinophilic myocarditis (Fig. 59.7C ). 521 Myocarditis is believed to represent a more fulminant and necrotic form of the endocardial disease. 522 Eosinophils have the ability to secrete highly toxic cationic proteins into areas of inflammation and to produce harmful oxygen radicals and potent lipid mediators, leading to myocyte necrosis as seen in proximity to degranulating cosinophils. 523 Animal experiments have confirmed that exposure of myocytes to eosinophil granule proteins is lethal, and ventricular function in the intact heart is reduced in hypereosinophilic states. 524 Eosinophilic myocardial infiltrates have been reported in association with profound eosinophilia caused by an allergic diathesis, parasitic infection, drug hypersensitivity, vasculitis, or Churg-Strauss syndrome, 66, 525, 526 but eosinophilic myocarditis can occur in the absence of profound eosinophilia. 527 Further, eosinophilic myocarditis may present as acute myocardial infarction, sudden death, cardiogenic shock, or nonspecific chest pain and dyspnea.",

Early biopsy-aided histologic confirmation is fundamental to antemortem diagnosis. Clinical improvement may occur with corticosteroid therapy. 527 Cardiac Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a multiorgan, noncaseating granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology. Histologically, it may involve the lung, lymph nodes, skin, liver, spleen, parotid glands, and heart. 528 Right heart failure owing to pulmonary manifestations of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis is the predominant cardiac finding. 529 Asymptomatic cardiac involvement is common, with a quarter of the patients having sarcoid granulomas in the heart at autopsy. 530 Characteristically, the noncaseating granulomas infiltrate the ventricular walls and become fibrotic. They may involve the conduction system, although there is no definite predilection for specialized tissues. There may be transmural involvement with fibrous replacement of portions of the myocardium and aneurysm formation. 531 The fibrous transition of granulomas may result in early diastolic dysfunction, but as the disease progresses and with extensive involvement, systolic impairment occurs. Whereas cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis commonly occurs as part of the systemic affliction, isolated cardiac sarcoidosis in the absence of systemic disease has been described. 532 The clinical presentation of cardiac sarcoidosis is variable and may depend on the amount of myocardium replaced with granulomas and the amount and location of scar tissue. Rhythm abnormalities and conduction disorders predominate, 533 although asymptomatic patients with mildly restrictive filling patterns may elude medical attention. Patients with CHF may show clinical features of restrictive cardiomyopathy or DCM. 534 Papillary dysfunction with mitral regurgitation and pericardial involvement with effusiveconstrictive disease have also been described. 533 Radionuclide myocardial imaging with thallium 201 and gallium 67 is helpful in identifying patients with myocardial involvement. 535 Magnetic resonance imaging has also been proposed as a diagnostic modality. 536, 537 Histologic diagnosis with endomyocardial biopsy is corroborative, but a negative biopsy does not rule out the possibility, owing to sampling error.",

            "text": "The combination of bilateral hilar adenopathy and myocardial disease suggests cardiac sarcoidosis in a young person. Corticosteroids are indicated when myocardial involvement, conduction abnormalities, and ventricular arrhythmias are present. 538 Patients with scintigraphic uptake of gallium 67 may be more responsive to corticosteroid therapy. 539 Perma-nent pacemakers may be needed to treat the conduction abnormalities. Implantable defibrillators may be utilized in the prevention of sudden death. 540 Heart failure is treated in the conventional manner, whereas heart transplantation is reserved for intractable heart failure. 541 Heart-lung transplants are performed infrequently for patients with pulmonary involvement, but there is a significant risk of recurrent disease. 541 Peripartum Myocarditis/Cardiomyopathy Virchow and Porak first reported the association of pregnancy with DCM in 1870 in an autopsy series. 542 Peripartum myocarditis/cardiomyopathy occurs in one of every 3,000 to 15,000 pregnancies. The incidence is higher in Africa, and it increases with older age, multiparity, multiple gestations, and prior history of peripartum myocarditis/cardiomyopathy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is currently believed to be a myocarditis of unknown etiology, perhaps an infectious, autoimmune, or idiopathic process. The viral myocarditis hypothesis stems from the observations that pregnant mice are more susceptible to cardiotropic viruses, with increased viral replication, 543 and with the increased hemodynamic burden of pregnancy, the myocardial lesions worsen. 544 Recently, it has been postulated that after delivery, the rapid degeneration of the uterus results in fragmentation of tropocollagen by enzymatic degradation. This releases actin, myosin, and their metabolites, and antibodies are formed that then cross-react with the myocardium. 542 An association between tocolytic therapy and cardiomyopathy has also been reported. 545 While the diagnosis of peripartum myocarditis/cardiomyopathy is traditionally made during the last trimester or during the first 5 months postpartum, earlier occurrence has been reported. 546 The presentation is usually of decompensated ventricular systolic failure in the absence of any identifiable cardiac pathology. The LVEF normalizes in approximately 50% of women and is more likely to normalize if the initial LVEF is >30%. Therapy is tailored to the decompensated state with diuretics, digoxin, and vasodilators (ACEIs are contraindicated in pregnancy). Inotropic therapy may be needed for supporting those in cardiogenic shock, along with the use of mechanical circulatory-assist devices. Although there are anecdotal reports of benefit of immunosuppressive therapy, 547 the routine use of these agents cannot be recommended; in fact, the only indication would be biopsy-proven fulminant myocarditis. Cardiac transplantation is an alternative therapeutic option and may be offered to those with intractable heart failure, but it is preferred that transplantation be delayed. The early outcome after transplantation in these patients is often unfavorable, with increased allograft rejection, and the natural history of peripartum myocarditis/cardiomyopathy suggests that more than half of the patients have spontaneous resolution. 548 There are perhaps two different subgroups. One presents with a rapidly progressive, fulminant course with often nearcomplete resolution of myocardial dysfunction within days and excellent long-term prognosis. 547 The other group has late, insidious onset and presents with progressively worsening heart failure with poor prognosis. It is often difficult to differentiate this from the common variety of DCM.",

Virus-induced lymphocytic myocarditis progresses through three stages: active viral infection, autoimmunity, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis is no longer a diagnosis of exclusion; histology, histochemistry, DNA and RNA detection, tissue and circulating antibody detection, and a variety of imaging techniques can be used together or, in some cases, independently to make the diagnosis and to establish the disease stage. Treatment of myocarditis must be tailored to the phase of disease. Many new therapies based on knowledge of the molecular pathophysiology of myocarditis are under development. ",
