Many types of viruses can remain viable for several hours on hands and, generally, much longer on environmental surfaces.8 Infectious virus particles have been isolated from naturally contaminated hands of caregivers and fomites.5 Since hands can donate or receive viruses during casual contact with animate and inanimate surfaces,9 proper and regular decontamination of hands by caregivers is crucial in preventing and controlling the spread of viral and other types of pathogen. Evidence from experimental as well as epidemiological studies indicates that environmental surfaces may also play a role in the nosocomial spread of respiratory and enteric nosocomial viral pathogens.8\n",

Microbicides can also interrupt pathogen transfer from contaminated to clean surfaces. In hospitals, viruses which lend themselves to interruption by proper microbicide use are those which spread mainly through hands, fomites, medical devices, and environmental surfaces.",

Most hospitals have a pool of such highly susceptible individuals.

This makes it difficult to design and apply proper strategies to prevent and control nosocomial outbreaks of viral infections. Hand are universally recognized as vehicles for the spread of a number of viruses,25 but lack of compliance with handwashing and perhaps the use of ineffective handwash agents continue to undermine the full potential of infection control measures in this regard. The ease with which washed hands can pick up infectious viruses upon contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and objects suggests that the emphasis on handwashing should be combined with an awareness of the need for proper and frequent decontamination of those surfaces and objects that come in frequent contact with washed hands.",
