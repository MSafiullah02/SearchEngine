Hypotheses developed for transmission dynamics in community or hospital and defining the laboratory criteria for the case confirmation will be most crucial in terms of clear understanding and interventions needed for containment of an outbreak. Non-pharmaceutical interventions on transmissibility can reduce the number of total cases. Social distancing can be one of the most effective measures to reduce the peak burden on the health care system. 6 Overall, the impact of the outbreak as well as the interventions also needs timely and frequent assessment.

The understanding of natural history/course of COVID-19 will help in triaging the patients in hospital settings. Defining the clinical case definitions and sampling strategy will help in differentiating COVID-19 from other similar illnesses with or without pneumonia. Ignoring other differential diagnosis can invariably be counterproductive from diagnosis and management point-of-view. Studying prognosis factors in COVID-19 confirmed cases will help in developing comprehensive management plan/approach with combination of various drugs or instituting newer therapeutics of proven or experimental efficacy. Transmission of COVID-19 in health care workers (HCW) is a cause of deep concern, hence, all three precautions -droplet, contact and airborne must be suitably practiced by every health care personnel. Keeping daily records of medical examination of HCW can help in early detection and further spread. Continuous training appropriate at each level must also be documented. Hospital admission and discharge policies need to be defined in consonance with national policy. Logistics for PPE and other consumables needs to be ensured. Only trained personnel in batches may be allowed to work. The expert advice must be readily available in case of breech of unprecedented practice. Optimization and re-use of certain consumables/ supplies may be permitted as per safety norms. The scope of newer diagnostics and treatment approaches will pave the way for defining the future guidelines.

Optimum and effective use of PPE in designated areas will play a crucial role in reducing the risk of transmission in health care workers. 8 Behavioural and cultural factors must also be taken into an account as they influence the compliance. Quarantine facilities should be welldesigned and away from habitation. Isolation facilities with separate rooms and negative air pressure in case of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 positive cases will substantially be useful for containment as well as protection of health workers.

Repurposing of drug molecules is an elegant strategy to develop therapeutics in the case of pandemics quickly. The general plan for repurposing can involve computational approaches to determine the likelihood of a drug molecule to affect SARS CoV2 based on its similarity to the known target of that molecule. 9 Another method is to experimentally study the interaction between proteins of SARS CoV2 and humans and use it to develop a list of therapeutic candidates. Prophylaxis will play an essential role in the elimination of COVID-19 in the long run. However, a successful vaccine will require the development and standardization of animal models to check for the efficacy of vaccine candidates using a challenge study.",

The other aspect which needs a more concerted effort is to have regulatory compliance for developed targets for therapeutics and vaccine. In the case of a pandemic, the usual route of clinical trials is too cumbersome and may take years to develop a therapeutic intervention. The use of adaptive clinical trial designs will help in expediting regulatory approval. 10 Adaptive clinical trials such as multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) trials aim at using the real-world clinical practice of learning and reacting as and when an event happens. The flexibility of MAMS allows changing the course of a clinical trial without compromising its integrity or validity, thereby ensuring that more patients receive better treatments. Regulatory authorities and research bodies may allow such school of thoughts to expedite the development of therapeutics and vaccines.",
