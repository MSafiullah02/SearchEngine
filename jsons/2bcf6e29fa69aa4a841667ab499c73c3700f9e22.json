Up to March 23rd, there was a count of Recovered (R) as well, but this was stopped for various reasons. One reason that applies for Germany is that there simply is no defined registration for the Recovered. Authorities only report confirmed cases and deaths, but they say [2] that a person with mild or no symptoms is considered to be recovered after 14 days. However, the Recovered are extremely important for analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak. They are the major R part of standard models like SIR and SEIR [3] , and they define the Infectious I = C \u2212 D \u2212 R that hopefully have a peak at some time from the exponential outbreak. Prediction of this peak is the central problem for any analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The dotted green values are the R data from the old data set, as far as available. The deviations from the dotted and the continuous R values are not necessarily failures of the method, because the old R data were questionable anyway and might not maintain data consistency. France has not reported any Recovered for quite some time, and the data from Germany is doubtful for the procedural reasons mentioned above.",
