Steady state conditions are rarely constant but evolutionary adaptation is too slow to adapt to daily threats so a surrogate variation mechanism is necessary. The genome defines the most basic instructions for life so that a molecular biology perspective provides the foundation for understanding resilience. Variations in the expression of RNA offers rapid variation and this book proposes this is the basis of resilience. This book attempts to illuminate mechanisms of resilience beginning with elaborating threats leading to disruption in steady state conditions. Recognition of threats and defense systems are described followed by adaptive changes in gene expression that refine responses. Finally, environmental conditions are discussed that serve to dampen the adaptive response oscillator to disruptive threats at the level of RNA expression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "This prologue is intended to acquaint the reader with my background and the genesis of optimism for an idea that the benefit of transcriptome plasticity is resilience. I grew up in several National Parks, remote regions of the United States that are set aside to preserve natural environments. I attended 12 schools by the time I graduated from high school, a fact that forced me to develop personal resilience. My career path as a scientist followed a path from ecologist to pharmacologist to molecular biologist.

The park rangers visiting our house would tell stories of toads and ants in the region, they convinced me to let the lizard go free.

I had no idea what kind of snake I had, in fact I did not know there were different kinds of snake. I brought the snake home to show to the family. A new discovery was that my brother expressed severe anxiety over the snake and my proximity to him, he ran. I then discovered my mother also shared a deep fear of snakes. They encouraged me to let the snake go free but the incident was not complete until I got a snake lecture from the park naturalist. The impromptu lecture was amazing; we looked at about a half-dozen different snakes in glass enclosures including the local rattlesnake.

As I grew older, my journeys into the desert become longer with greater range from home. My parents concern for my explorations centered on my lack of social development. They began exploring boarding school options for my brother and I but we stayed to attend our one-room school. Monsoon-like rains arrived late in the spring leaving pools of water in the barren clay soil. My brother and I found a muddy pool filled with hundreds of tadpoles, possibly the canyon treefrog (Hyla arenicolor). We watched these tadpoles mature over a two-week period and all were gone, buried in the mud, when the pool dried up.

The aquarium experience included routine cleaning and removal of algae from the glass at times. I added catfish to the aquarium to reduce the algae but they did not completely remove the green haze from the glass. I added snails and more living plants and found the algae problem solved. An early lesson in the living interplay, ecology. The 9th grade scientist in me and availability of a plastic sphere inspired an idea of a self-contained ecological system. Gravel in the bottom, living plants, snails, and two fish were added to the fresh water system. I cut a hole in the top so a rubber stopper with a glass pipe could allow for pressure equalization. Those fish were still alive in an algae free plastic sphere after two years when I had to take the experiment apart.

The message is that life will find a way. How do living things prepare or adapt to isolated environments? My first real world research position was with Gradient Modelling, Inc. in Glacier National Park for the summer of 1975. Gradient Modelling was the creation of Stephen R. Kassel, a recent Cornell University Ph.D. under the direction of R. H. Whittaker. Steve wanted to exploit the marriage of computer science and ecology. He divided the environment of Glacier National Park into six continuous \"gradients\" including: elevation, topographical-moisture and aspect, primary succession (soil development following glacial retreat), watershed location, alpine wind-snow exposure, and time since the last forest fire (Kessell 1976) . My job was as part of the Northern Forest Fire Lab for data collection to measure species diversity and fire fuel loading. The data from several teams including mine supported the computer model, which would predict forest-fire burn area, anticipate resulting plant and animal communities, and support fire management decisions in the park.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1079, "end": 1093, "text": "(Kessell 1976)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Forest fires create diverse, mosaic, and resilient forests because the fires arise from lightning strikes that occur during rainstorms and are inherently limited to small regions. Human interactions involve fire suppression measures that support maintenance of large climax forests, vulnerable to large catastrophic fires and diminished ecoregion diversity. The objective of the project was to support a \"let burn\" policy implemented in Glacier but limitations included stakeholders with interests at the park boundaries; the Flathead Indian Reservation, the Blackfoot Indian Reservation, Canada, and the Bob Much Wilderness Area. The job involved weekly backpacking trips to most regions of Glacier National Park and measuring plant diversity, an obligate lesson in taxonomy. The greater my capacity to identify genus and species of animals, trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, the more the appreciation of the impact of the environment on species diversity. I helped write a \"Student Originated Studies (SOS)\" grant to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which was funded. The project evaluated the ecology around Strawberry Reservoir during the summer after graduation (Worley et al. 1977) . The objective was to use aquatic invertebrates as indicator species including: caddisfly (rock rollers), stonefly nymphs, mayflies, amphipods, damselflies, midges and worms as indicators of pollution in the area. We repeatedly sampled the creeks and streams leading into (Trout, Co-op, Indian, Horse, Clyde, and Soldier Creek) and out of (Strawberry River) Strawberry Reservoir to assess the impact of recreational and agricultural uses of the area. The reservoir had been managed for 50 years by the Strawberry Water Users Association and significant problems developed. Fishing villages and campsites were established with variations of pit toilets within feet of the shoreline and these sites were to be inundated by an enlarged Strawberry Reservoir. The reservoir filled to capacity in 1975 when a series of wet years led to the first spill over since 1952 and high water inundated many trailers, outdoor toilets, and other facilities. The flood problems were associated with water quality concerns for undesirably high nutrient levels. The project supported plans to improve management of the area to ensure water quality and future safe recreational use of Strawberry Reservoir. The lessons from undergraduate research clearly pointed to humans as part of the environment and our influence on ecology. This raises a contemplative question, Are we to live in harmony with the environment or are we adversaries? Background Analysis of indicator species remains an active area of environmental research. These indicator species offer a time averaged measure of an organism's adaptive response to the environment, which provides immediate practical value to environmental monitoring. Clearly, the most interesting aspect of indicator species is the boundary they define and the potential for hyper-adapted species at the boundary. Boundaries raise a question, are the adaptations a function of the survival of the fittest organisms driving evolution or can fluctuations in populations of RNA in the transcriptome provide a faster adaptive responses?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1177, "end": 1197, "text": "(Worley et al. 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "After completing my undergraduate degree, I landed a position as a biology research technician in the laboratory of Dr. Martin Rechsteiner at the University of Utah.

Gordon Lark (plant DNA expert), David Wolstenholm (mitochondrial DNA expert), Mario Capecci (Nobel Prize winner and gene transfer authority), and Baldimore Olivera (cone-shell toxin expert). My project involved SV40 virus and explored transformation in contrast to lytic infection in mammalian cells. The hypothesis was that mouse 3 T3 cells transformed with SV40 virus (SV3T3 cells) was due to failure of the virus to synthesize \"late\" proteins due to lack of specific iso-accepting tRNAs. I isolated tRNA from lytic TC7 African Green Monkey cells then loading the tRNA into red blood cells that were then fused to SV3T3 cells delivering tRNAs. We expected the SV3T3 cells to release SV40 virus into the medium but our hypothesis was incorrect (Schlegel et al. 1978) . A second project involved using Sendai virus (a paramyxovirus) to fuse mouse 3 T3 cells with human HeLa cells to create mouse: human hybrid cells. I then observed the kinetics of chromosome loss as the hybrid cell line divided. I became expert at preparing metaphase spreads on microscope slides. The key observation was that mouse chromosomes, identified by their epicentric V shape, are maintained in favor of human chromosomes, identified by their metacentric X shape.

Dr. Partlow was a cellular neuroscientist, a specialty of great personal interest. We dissected 12-day chicken embryos to remove sympathetic ganglia from adjacent to the spinal cord, a technique requiring steady hands and a stereo microscope in a sterile hood. Alternately, I removed the dorsal root ganglia rom the spinal cord to recover cholinergic tissue. Once the surgery was complete, the tissues was digested to produce a single cell suspension that was then subjected to intermittent vibration so the glial cells would attach to the culture dish leaving the neurons in suspension. I developed innovative strategies to encourage neurons to adhere to the culture dish enabling studies of pure primary neuronal cultures (Iversen et al. 1981) . I became expert at measuring acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and carbonic anhydrase enzyme activities.

I set up a microscope with a heated stage and videotaped the culture for hours. The beads moved along the axon towards the cell body in a saltatory manner.

This family of enzymes were important to drug companies because they frequently inactivated drugs by oxidative metabolism. In addition, these enzymes metabolize a wide variety of foreign substrates, xenobiotics, from the environment and in some cases; the metabolic products are chemically reactive as radical cations. The reactive products form chemical bonds with cellular molecules including DNA, which link them to mutations and chemical carcinogenesis. The CYP enzymes reside in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and their metabolic action transforms highly lipid soluble substrates capable of long residence in cellular membranes into more water-soluble products that are carried out of the cell and out of the body. The CYP oxidations represent an energy efficient reaction in contrast to reduction reactions, which highlight the need for cells to manage energy utilization. The cellular content of CYP enzymes is reduced when the cell goes through the cell cycle suggesting a functional connection between CYP and growth. My dissertation investigated the expression of multiple CYP enzymes in the rat liver as it regenerates following partial hepatectomy . We knew there were multiple genes encoding CYP enzymes but we did not know how many and reagents were not available to evaluate specific CYP genes.

My project quickly turned using the mouse gene as a probe to find and clone the human version of CYP1A1. The group effort was successful in isolating the first gene encoding a human drug-metabolizing enzyme. I spent 9 months subcloning and sequencing this gene (Iversen et al. 1987 ), a task that would take hours today.

I combined the essence of molecular biology with pharmacology in the exploration of antisense inhibitors of gene expression. The concept that a short single-stranded DNA molecule could be synthesized to bind to its complementary single-stranded RNA transcript to inhibit translation had the potential to lead to a vast new area of pharmacology. My friend, Dr. Mario Stevenson, was growing the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) in cell culture and we decided to collaborate on a project to use antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit HIV-1 viral growth (Stevenson and Iversen 1989) . I then worked with a group at the NIH to reveal the sulfur modified DNA oligomer inhibited the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity independent of the oligomer sequence (Egan et al. 1991 ). An emerging belief that antisense oligomers could be RNA-based drugs became the focus of my future research. I wanted to see if a synthetic oligonucleotide would have drug-like properties so I developed a method for synthesis of a radioactive phosphorothioate synthetic DNA molecule and then injected it into rats to estimate various pharmacokinetic properties (Iversen 1991; Iversen et al. 1994) . I was convinced a synthetic oligonucleotide would distribute into multiple organs but would it inhibit targeted gene expression? I investigated multiple gene targets for inhibition in animal models including a mouse tumor model of chronic myelogenous leukemia (Skorski et al. 1994) ) and rat models of CYP2B1 and CYP3A2 . With feasibility and in vivo efficacy completed, I explored the potential therapeutic limitations; finding a cardiovascular toxicity (Cornish et al. 1993 ) and reactive metabolite adduct formation from small molecule therapeutics (Copple et al. 1995) . These limitations define a fulcrum in the risk to benefit balance for a patient with a lethal leukemia. I worked with a group at UNMC to investigate an antisense inhibitor of p53, an overexpressed gene in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; (Bayever et al. 1993a) ). I directed the effort to prepare an investigational new drug (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and gained permission to proceed to conduct the first evaluation of a systemically administered synthetic oligonucleotides in humans (Bayever et al. 1993b ). The first-in-human milestone with antisense led to an international press release, which aired, on CNN International in 1992. The appearance of my name in the interview process led to a request from King Hussain of Jordan to treat his lymphoma as well as hundreds of requests to treat patients with this emerging technology. The international recognition of my accomplishment supported my promotion to full professor, resulted in numerous invitations to present these first-ever clinical observations, and a position on the national board of directors of the Leukemia Society of America. I participated in the creation of a new biotechnology company, Lynx, as a spin off from Applied Biosystems and prepared IND documents for antisense targeting bcrabl in collaboration with Bruno Callebretta at Thomas Jefferson University, c-myc with Andrew Zalewski at Thomas Jefferson University, and c-myb in collaboration with Alan Gewertz at the University of Pennsylvania. My research effort for each of these projects involved firsthand experience with the concept of translating synthetic DNA into a drug product by exploiting the questions of dose, dose interval, route of administration, and dose limitations by conducting the first pharmacokinetic and preclinical toxicology studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 708, "end": 736, "text": "(Stevenson and Iversen 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 908, "end": 925, "text": "(Egan et al. 1991", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1304, "text": "(Iversen 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1325, "text": "Iversen et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1609, "text": "(Skorski et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1803, "text": "(Cornish et al. 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1900, "text": "(Copple et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2141, "end": 2163, "text": "(Bayever et al. 1993a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2424, "end": 2445, "text": "(Bayever et al. 1993b", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RNA Based Therapeutics"}, {"text": "I identified numerous sequence-independent limitations associated with phosphorothioate (PSO) chemistry including: activation of complement, inhibition of coagulation, inhibition of cell surface receptors, stimulation of immune responses, and the generation of radical oxygen in cells producing 8-oxo-guanine adducts in RNA, DNA and the oligonucleotide. I looked at the radical oxygen production in a V79 cell line selecting for cells capable of growing in 6-thioguanine (HGPRT \u2212/\u2212 ) as well as oubain (Na/K ATPase \u2212/\u2212 ) and identified enhanced mutagenesis frequency. Later studies with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) compounds did not produce this radical oxygen response. While I felt publication of this mutagenesis activity was important, I was not able to convince our regulatory affairs people to explore this further for fear of finding something we did not want to know. An extension of this limitation was in the role of GLP studies in which contract research organizations do not recommend non-traditional mutagenesis assays in part due to lack of validated V79 cell lines. Mutagenesis assays are generally done with no intent to understand the process and the FDA does not demand much of these assays since they have some difficulty determining how to interpret the data. Basically, don't ask and don't tell until something arises in treated humans.

The first project involved collaboration with Steve Wilton in Perth Australia which led to the discovery and development of Eteplirsen, designed to induce skipping of exon 51 in the dystrophin transcript in boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

The early notions of a relationship between expression of CYP enzymes and the cell cycle have become more interesting. The CYP enzymes are generally suppressed during infection, a response that is rapid and observed after viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection. The hypothesis is that an endogenous CYP substrate is an inhibitor of DNA and RNA polymerases and suppression of CYP activity means elevated concentrations of endogenous inhibitor-a protective response. Aphidicolin, a fungal diterpenoid compound, is a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerase and a potential valuable anti-cancer agent but it is rapidly metabolized by CYP enzymes. The hypothesis is that various polymerases are linked to biological molecules in the environment and the CYP family modulate that activity. The diterpenes are chemically diverse with broad biological activity. Are these activities modulated by CYP expression? Can environmental exposure to chemical congeners disrupt the modulation?

However, recent improvements in our understanding of the genome have revealed that over 80 percent of the genome is transcribed into RNA, focusing new attention several emergent classes of noncoding RNA. Hence, much of the key information from GWAS has been overlooked inadvertently, as many variants are found in noncoding regions or unannotated regions of the genome (St. Laurent et al. 2014 ). Non-coding RNA (Table 1 .1) can be divided into long non-coding RNA, lncRNA, and small non-coding RNA. The small ncRNA include: (1) miRNAs that are 18-21 nt in length and are involved in regulation of gene expression, (2) siRNA that are 21 nt segments that regulate gene expression and transposon activity, (3) rasiRNA are 24-27 nt that help form centromeres and orient heterochromatin, (4) piRNA or piwi-interacting RNA are 26-30 nt molecules that regulate transposon activity and chromatin, (5) snoRNA are 60-300 nt in length that create 2'-O-methyl and pseudo uridylation modifications of other RNAs, and (6) snRNAs that are 100-300 nt which are involved in assembly of the spliceosome and nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of pre-mRNA (Dogini et al. 2014) . lncRNA are a novel class of functional RNAs that impinge on gene regulation involving recruitment of epigenetic modifier proteins, control of mRNA decay and DNA sequestration of transcription factors. The human genome appears to produce over 60,000 lncRNA, the majority expressed at low levels. Early examples of transacting lncRNAs are inhibitory polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) and the activating Trithorax/MLL chromatin modifiers HOTAIR and HOTTIP. The lncRNome contains cis-acting enhancer elements (eRNAs) which control the expression of neighboring protein coding genes. A lncRNA mediating alternative splicing via assembly of serine/arginine splicing factors within subnuclear components called speckles, MALAT1, is retained in the nucleus. A lncRNA called TINCR binds to the 3'-UTR and elicits Staufen-mediated decay (SMD; (Kornfeld and Bruning 2014) ). Life is a battle of enthalpy over entropy. The membrane barriers and cell walls found in virtually every living thing separate the greater enthalpic state from the randomness of non-life. Each challenge toward entropy, lack of order, threatens the persistence of life. Changes in the ordered state are obligate to adapt to drivers of disorder.

In the case of humans, the accumulation will take numerous generations, which are roughly 20 years in duration. In the case of a virus, the accumulation will take hours. In this regard, viruses are hundreds of thousands of times more adaptable then humans.
