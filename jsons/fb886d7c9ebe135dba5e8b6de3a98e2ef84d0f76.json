Both considered the cysts of pneumocystis as part of the trypanosome's life cycle. Shortly afterward the Delanoes lo found identical forms in the lungs of rats that had not been infected with trypanosomes and recognized the organism as a separate species. The name Pneumocystis carinii, was given to this organism as a generic name (Greek: pneumon, \"lung\"; kystis, \"cyst\"), honoring CariniiY",

            "text": "The organism attained medical significance, when van der Meer and Brug l2 in 1942, and later Vanek, Jirovec, and Luke suggested it to be the cause of interstitial plasma cell pneumonia, a disease affecting premature and debilitated infants in central and eastern Europe. 12 ,13 In the 1960s P. carinii was recognized as an important cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised adults on corticosteroids and cancer chemotherapy, in organ transplant recipients, and in children with primary immunodeficiency syndromes. 6 The emergence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the 1980s thrust P. carinii to the forefront once again, as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, 14 Pneumocystis organisms infecting human beings have recently been named P. jiroveci. 15 The complete identification and classification of pneumocystis has taken many decades. Although initially considered to be a protozoan, it is now generally agreed that pneumocystis is a fungus. The ribosomal RNA is homologous to that found in fungi. 16 ,17 A study of the small subunits of ribosomal RNA (16S-like rRNA) of P. carinii and the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows close evolutionary linkage between the two. 16 The pneumocystis organisms also stain with methenamine silver stains, further supporting a closer link to fungi rather than pro-tozoa. Recent molecular genetic studies that demonstrate the thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase genes to be similar to their counterparts in S. cerevisiae support the classification of pneumocystis as a fungus. 17 Furthermore, ultrastructural studies have failed to show the cytoskeletal elements and complex organelle systems characteristic of protozoa. 18 ,19 Pneumocystis organisms are ubiquitous and globally distributed, having been identified in virtually every mammalian species including humans as well as rabbits, dogs, goats, cats, swine, chimpanzees, owl monkeys, and horses,z0-26 The organisms have a wide range of genetic characteristics that are host specific. 27 The pneumocystis that infects humans, P. jiroveci, is different from the one that infects rats, and there is no cross-species infection. 15 ,27 This observation was confirmed when polymerase chain reaction (PCR) applied to the human pneumocystis identified only P. jiroveci. 28 ,29 Epidemiology The epidemiologic features of P. jiroveci are poorly understood. Experimental studies have shown that the infection is acquired by inhalation. 3 O-33 There does not appear to be a natural transmission of P. jiroveci across species. 27 ,34-36 Immunosuppressed rats and nude mice acquire the infection by direct and distant contact with infected animals. In humans, the major predisposing factor is impaired cellular immunity as seen in AIDS, protein-calorie malnutrition, primary immunodeficiency diseases, immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids or other agents, and prematurity. 37 The organisms are present in practically every part of the world, including the temperate, tropical, and polar regions. 38 The use of molecular technology through the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) locus analysis has facilitated epidemiologic study of the prevalence of P. jiroveci in the human population. Identical genotypes of P. jiroveci were found in the two groups of immunocompetent infants and adults with pneumocystis infection in a study from France, suggesting that the transmission cycles of infection in all individuals parasitized by P jiroveci are linked with a common human reservoir. 39 ,40 It is not clear whether there is an environmental reservoir for P jiroveci, although mammalian lung appears to be a natural home. 35 The isolation of pneumocystis DNA from rural outdoor locations and a seasonal variation in infection in patients suggest that there may be an environmental reservoir. 41 Primary exposure to pneumocystis occurs early in life, so that most children have serum antibody by the age of 2 to 3 years. 42 -45 This is presumed to be an asymptomatic infection. The organisms remain latent within the host, and propagate when the host immune system becomes compromised. Several studies using PCR have found no evidence of pneumocystis DNA in the lungs of immunocompetent individuals, and do not support the latent reactivation theory. 41,46--48 There are also experimental data in rat models that suggest that pneumocystis organisms do not persist in the lungs of immunocompetent individuals. 49 Transmission of pneumocystis has been shown to occur animal to animal when they had a common air supply, in immunosuppressed as well as immunocompetent models, although the latter had a subclinical transient infection. 41 ,5o,51 Clinical studies have suggested the occurrence of human to human transmission of pneumocystis organisms. [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] Acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients have been found to develop immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies with recurrent episodes of pneumocystis pneumonia. 57 It has also been shown by immunoblotting that P jiroveci (carinii) antigen recognition patterns in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid can change with recurrent episodes of pneumonia. 58 These findings may represent infections with different antigenic strains or antigenic changes in the existing strain of P jiroveci. Recently, mutations in the DHPS gene of P jiroveci were identified and used in epidemiologic studies of P jiroveci. In one study of 139 HIV-infected patients with pneumocystis infection, 19% of patients with prior sulfa treatment had the gene mutation, compared to 4 % of those without treatment. 59 Co-infection with multiple strains of P jiroveci was found in 20% to 30% of cases, suggesting that recurrent infections may be related to reinfection with a new strain rather than reactivation. 60 The DHPS gene-type variation was related to the place of diagnosis and not the place of birth, suggesting the infection to be recently acquired. Additionally, 54 % of P jiroveci strains in newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients demonstrate DHPS gene mutations. Since these patients were not treated with sulfa drugs, such mutations suggest that the infection was acquired from patients who had received prophylactic sulfa. The authors therefore believed that these findings represent evidence for person-to-person AK. Haque and P.A Adegboyega transmission of pneumocystis. Person-to-person spread of P jiroveci is also suggested by outbreaks of infection in malnourished infants in orphanages and in hospitals caring for immunosuppressed patients. 37",

Experiments using P carinii from lungs of infected rats and human lung cell cultures have been partially successful in growing the organisms to study the life cycle. 68 Based on the cell culture studies, it was proposed that several developmental pathways may exist. 68 The environment may play a significant role in determining the predominant method of replication as it does in many yeast or other microorganisms. 69 }O In tissue culture, at least two methods of development were proposed: an asexual cycle and a sexual cycle. Figure 13 .1 shows the two cycles of P jiroveci pneumonia development. The asexual cycle involves mitotic replication of the trophic forms. The sexual cycle involves the continued development of precyst stages to mature cyst forms, and the development of elongated daughter forms within the cyst, followed by excystation and collapse of the cyst.",

The sporozoites have a single nucleus, a mitochondrion, abundant endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, as well as microtubules and vacuoles. They are reported to be attached to each other and to the cyst wall by a thread or stalk-like structure?? Many cysts contain single or paired, comma-shaped structures that are localized areas of thickening of the inner layer of the cyst wall. These distinctive argyrophilic structures help to distinguish the cysts of P. jiroveci from nonbudding yeast-like fungi and other pathogens. Although seen best with GMS, the thickened foci can also be stained with toluidine blue 0, but not reliably with the Gram-Weigert stain. None of the cyst wall stains demonstrate the sporozoites or trophozoites, although the membranes of the latter may stain faintly in specimens heavily overstained with GMS .",

The trophozoites have a cell wall with three layers similar to the cyst; however, the middle electron-lucent layer is thin and poorly developed. Each trophozoite contains a single nucleus, cytoplasmic organelles, and glycogen, although not all of these elements are seen in every trophozoite. Electron micrographs of the trophozoites demonstrate the filopodia and the relationship between the filopodia and the pneumocytes (Figs. 13.2 and 13.3). Occasionally, trophozoites assume shapes that suggest reproduction by either binary fission or endogeny. The trophozoites tend to cluster in large aggregates, where FIGURE 13.2.

It is the clustering of the trophozoites that produces the appearance of alveolar \"honeycomb exudate\" seen on light microscopy.

The precysts are oval in shape and 4 to 6/-lm in diameter. The cell wall is up to 100 nm in thickness, with an electron-lucent layer that is thicker than that of trophozoites. The cytoplasm contains one or more nuclei, mitochondria, free ribosomes, microtubules, vacuoles, and glycogen granules.

            "text": "Antigenic studies of pneumocystis using Western blot technique have revealed several major antigens. 75 ,94-96 The most prominent surface antigen of pneumocystis is seen as a band of 116 kDa on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 37 There is cross-reactivity between this antigen from humans and other mammals. Another major class of antigens in rodent-derived P. carinii migrates in the 45-to 50-kDa range. The relationship of this antigen to the 116-kDa antigen is not clear. A third antigen that is the most prominent feature of human-derived pneumocystis is a broad intensely staining band between 35 and 45 kDa. 75 . 9 4-96 This is the most common band found in the lungs and bronchoalveolar fluid of patients with P jiroveci infection, while the 116-kDa band is less prominent in these specimens. 96 Exposure to pneumocystis organisms evokes an immune response in the host. 97 Serologic studies using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) have demonstrated serum antibodies to P. jiroveci in childhood under conditions of natural exposure. 43 ,98 These antibodies are primarily directed against the 35-to 45-kDa band antigen, although antibodies to other bands were also recognized. 57 This study also found that >90% of AIDS patients developed IgM or IgG antibodies to the 35-to 45-kDa band and other antigens with recurrent episodes of pneumocystis infection. The role of these antibodies is unclear; however, there is some evidence that they may function as opsonins. 99 The development of PCP is related to impairment of cell-mediated immunity. The most prominent disease in this category is AIDS, although there has been an increase in non-AIDS patients also. In AIDS and HIV infection, there is a decline in the number and function of circulating CD4+ T-helper cells, the increased incidence of PCP being directly proportional to the fall in CD4+ T lymphocytes. 100 Pneumocystis organisms are host-specific, but the reason for this stringent specificity is not clear.27 P. jiroveci, the only pneumocystis identified in humans, has a unique tropism for the lung, where it exists primarily as an alveolar pathogen. A few cases of invasive infection with dissemination are reported with severe immunosuppression or overwhelming infection of the hOSt. 101 The availability of molecular techniques has identified key molecules in the cell cycle, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways of pneumocystis. The first specific molecule identified was glycoprotein A, a major surface glycoprotein with an integral role in the attachment of pneumocystis to host cells. 45 .102-104 This surface glycoprotein is immunogenic and antigenically distinct in each form of pneumocystis infecting various mammalian hosts. 102,104 The major component of the cyst wall is ~-1,3glucan, and the pneumocystis ~-1,3-g1ucan synthetase gene, GSCl, which mediates the polymerization of uridine 5' -diphosphoglucose into ~-1 ,3-g1ucan. I05 Inhibitors of ~-1,3-g1ucan synthetase are effective in clearing the cyst forms of pneumocystis from lungs of infected mammals. 106 ,107 The cyst wall also contains chitins and other complex polymers, including melanins that provide stability to the cell wall and invoke an inflammatory response in the lungs. 108, 109 Several signal-transduction molecules have been recently identified in pneumocystis. These include cdc2 cyclin-dependent kinase, cdc13 B-type cyclin, cdc25 mitotic phosphatase, and pneumocystis mitogen (PCM)-activated protein kinaseYO-l15 Furthermore, the finding of enhanced activity of PCM in the trophozoites as compared with the cyst forms suggests that the trophozoites may use this pathway for transitions in the life cycle. I I} During infection, the trophozoites adhere tightly to the alveolar epithelium, activating specific signaling pathways in the organism, including the gene encoding PCSTE20 kinase, which signals responses for mating and proliferation in fungal organisms. 114 Other signaling molecules identified in pneumocystis include the pheromone receptors, heterotrimeric G-protein subunits, and transcription factors. 115 \u00b7 116 Currently, some of these specific molecules are under intense research studies as potential drug targets. These include dihydrofolate reductase (target of trimethoprim), thymidylate synthase, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (target of mycophenolic acid), S-adenosyl-L-methionine:sterol C-24 methyl transferase (involved in biosynthesis of sterol), and lanosterol 14(a)-demethylase (the target enzyme of azole antifungal drugs ). 59, 117, 118 Pathogenesis of Infection Pneumocystis infection is acquired by inhalation. When the organism is deposited in the alveoli, the first critical step in the establishment of infection is attachment to the type I pneumocyte, through interdigitation of their cell membrane to the alveolar cell membrane. l19 This binding is facilitated by the interaction of host proteins, fibronectin and vitronectin, which bind to the surface of the trophozoites and mediate the attachment to integrin receptors of the alveolar cells. 120 The subsequent events depend on the immune status of the host; the organism can remain quiescent for a long period of time, and then proliferate when the host becomes immunocompromised.l19 Other investigators suggest that the organisms remain in the lungs for only a short time, In an immunocompromised host, the organisms start to proliferate, and the alveoli become progressively filled with masses of the pneumocystis organisms. In animal models, P carinii organisms increase from <10 5 to 10 9 or 1010 in 8 to 10 weeks. It is presumed that P jiroveci replicates in a similar manner in humans. The proliferation of P jiroveci results in the accumulation of the typical foamy, honeycomb-like alveolar exudates. Although the type I alveolar cells appear vacuolated and eroded in infected tissues, there is no evident disruption of structure or barrier function in lung epithelial cell cultures. I21 43 There is increasing evidence to support the role of humoral immunity in host defense against pneumocystis. Passive immunization with specific monoclonal antibody is shown to confer partial protection against P carinii in animal models. 129 Pneumocystis infection invokes a cellular response with production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, These inflammatory responses are required to control the infection, but an exuberant inflammatory response may result in pulmonary injury. Complex interactions between the inflammatory cells and the soluble mediators produced by these cells facilitate the clearing of infection, but may result also in lung injury. The key inflammatory cells include CD4+ T lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils. The complex interaction among the inflammatory cells, the soluble mediators, and the immune responses is presented in Figure 13 .4.",

It promotes the recruitment of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, and induces the production of other cytokines and chemokines, including IL-8 and interferon-y, which stimulate further recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. 140 ,141 Chemokines such as IL-8, macrophage-inflammatory protein-2, and the interferon-inducible protein of lOkDa are chemoattractants for neutrophils and important inflammatory mediators during pneumocystis infection. Interleukin-8 production is correlated with neutrophil 493 infiltration with release of reactive oxygen radicals, proteases, and cationic proteins, resulting in capillary endothelial and alveolar epithelial cell injury, in turn resulting in impaired gas exchange. Increased levels of IL-8 in BAL fluid are correlated with poor prognosis. 142",

This infection is more frequent in the United States and other developed countries, and indicates an underlying cellular immune deficiency with impairment of CD4+ (T-helper) lymphocyte function. 145 Diseases that predispose to pneumocystis pneumonia include congenital immunodeficiency diseases, immunodeficiency induced by cytotoxic agents and corticosteroids, and other acquired immunodeficiency.6,146,147 Before the AIDS epidemic, most adult patients with pneumocystis either had acute leukemia or were leukopenic from chemotherapy.6,147 Now these patients are vastly outnumbered by AIDSassociated pneumocystis. The incidence of PCP has undergone a significant reduction with the institution of chemoprophylaxis. 148 At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, PCP represented the most common AIDS index diagnosis, and the most life-threatening opportunistic infection, with an incidence of 44% to 74%.149 Approximately 80% of AIDS patients developed PCP during the course of their disease. 15o The incidence of PCP in HIVseropositive patients started to decrease in 1987, with only 16% of new index AIDS cases reported in 1993, almost exclusively due to the institution of chemoprophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy.149,151-157 In those individuals not receiving chemoprophylaxis, it still represents a serious pulmonary infection. 151 Rarely, PCP may develop in patients without a recognized predisposing illness. '58 The clinical and radiographic findings in sporadic P. jiroveci infection are not specific, and mimic those of other opportunistic infections. In AIDS patients, the onset of symptoms is more insidious. The fall in the circulating CD4+ T cell count usually correlates with the development of the pneumonia, with the vast majority of infections occurring when the CD4+ lymphocyte count is <200 cells. 100,15) The typical clinical presentation in HIVseropositive patients is an insidious onset, including fever, dyspnea, tachypnea, and nonproductive cough. 6 ,7,l59 Less frequently, weight loss, chest pain, night sweats, chills, fatigue, and malaise have been reported.'6O-'65 This is in contrast to the more acute presentation of HIV-seronegative immunocompromised patients. '66 Physical findings are often mild compared to the degree of symptomatic respiratory impairment. There is, however, a subset of HIV-seropositive patients that presents with an acute, fulminant onset, progressing to respiratory failure within 1 to 2 weeks.'60.l62,'67 The disease in non-AIDS patients may vary from an acute illness with an abrupt onset to a more indolent disease.

The mortality rate in patients with AIDS is 10% to 20% during the initial infection, but the rate increases substantially with the need for mechanical ventilation. 168 Patients with non-AIDS-related pneumocystosis present with an abrupt onset of respiratory insufficiency that may correlate with a tapering or increased dose of immunosuppressive therapy. These patients have more neutrophils and fewer pneumocystis organisms in the lungs than do patients with AIDS-associated pneumocystis pneumonia. 166 The mortality rate in patients with non-AIDS-related pneumocystis pneumonia is 30% to 60%, with a greater risk of death among patients with cancer than among patients with transplants or other diseases such as connective tissue disorders. 4 , '69 Extrapulmonary Infection Extrapulmonary infection is being recognized with increasing frequency, and appears to correlate with the use of inhaled prophylactic pentamidine therapy.17o,171 A review of autopsy cases with AIDS shows an incidence of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis of 2.5 % to 2.8 % A.K.

At higher magnification, the exudate is punctuated with round basophilic dots that correspond to the nuclei of the sporozoites and trophozoites, and are best seen in tissue preserved with a good nuclear fixative, such as BS solution. 189 Recognition of the basophilic nuclear \"dots\" is helpful in the differential diagnosis of pneumocystis from alveolar edema and alveolar proteinosis, both with eosinophilic alveolar exudates, without any demonstrable nuclei. The alveolar exudate is composed predominantly of abundant P. jiroveci trophozoites admixed with cysts, membranotubular extensions, surfactant, and cellular debris enmeshed in fibrin. The alveolar exudate may be focal or diffuse, depending on the severity of infection. In formalin-fixed tissue, the exudate is often separated from the adjacent alveolar septa by an artifactual clear space due to retraction. The histologic appearance is so characteristic that a presumptive diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia can be made on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides, in the appropriate clinical setting. 19 The eosinophilic alveolar exudate stains with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. 194 Cysts are round to oval and focally curved disk-shaped or boat-shaped, and stain well with GMS or toluidine blue 0 (Fig. 13.7) . 194.195 Trophozoites are not seen on H&E stain, but easily can be seen in smears with Giemsa, Wright-Giemsa, or Diff-Quick stains (Table 13 .2). 196 In a progressive and chronic infection, interstitial and intraluminal fibrosis may be seen. One study reported interstitial and intraluminal fibrosis in 63% and 36% of lung biopsies, respectively.194.1 95 In acute progressive infection with respiratory failure, diffuse alveolar damage, A.K.

The lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates within the alveolar septa are associated with mild expansion of the septa with type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. In one large series of biopsies of HIVpositive patients, an interstitial infiltrate was graded only as mild or moderate in nearly 90% of the patients. 195 Figure 13 .8 shows the classical features of interstitial chronic inflammation. If severe, the chronic infiltrate may be misinterpreted as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), particularly if the typical foamy exudate is minimal. Intraalveolar cellular infiltrates are not a usual feature of active PCP, and when present, consist of macrophages that may contain intracytoplasmic pneumocystis cysts by silver stains. 189 The presence of numerous intraalveolar macrophages may simulate desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) .197 Cysts have been described in the alveolar pneumocyte cytoplasm in the early phase of PCP.

In some cases, alveolar intraluminal fibrosis consistent with organizing pneumonia may be seen (Fig. 13.10) . Many, if not most, of these cases are consistent with the organizing or proliferative phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which may also be the result of oxygen toxicity, concurrent viral infection, shock, or other recognized causes of DAD in HIV-positive patients, rather than injury by P. jiroveci (Fig. 13.9 ).",

The cysts are round to oval, 4 to 7!lm in maximum dimension, and often have collapsed crescent and helmet forms, as seen in Figures 13.6 and 13.7. An intracystic density \"central dot\" or \"paired comma structures\" due to a plaque-like thickening of the cyst wall is an important diagnostic feature of pneumocystis. 223 The alveolar foamy exudate is composed of trophozoites and sporozoites, which appear as basophilic dots on H&Estained tissue sections, and can be seen in smears (but not tissue sections) by Romanowsky stains (Giemsa, Wright, Diff-Quick), and Gram and methylene blue stains.",

The recognition of the single or paired, comma-shaped argyrophilic foci in the walls of P. jiroveci cysts is most important, since structures with this configuration are never seen in the walls of yeast. Production of blastoconidia by the process of external budding is a characteristic feature of yeast, but the cysts of P. jiroveci do not reproduce by budding. Cryptococcus neoformans has a mucopolysaccharide capsule that is mucicarmine positive and Fontana-Masson (melanin) stain positive (even in the capsule deficient organisms), which distinguishes it from cysts of P. jiroveci.
