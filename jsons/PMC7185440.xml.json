            "text": "The fulvous fruit bat, Rousettus leschenaulti, is distributed over Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Vietnam, south China, Java and Bali. It prefers to roost in dark places, such as caves or man\u2010made structures (Khan 1985). The main food of R. leschenaulti is fruit, e.g. litchi and longan (Fujita & Tuttle 1991). Occasionally, it also eats orchards, which has resulted in the killing of bats in large scale in China, and the population size has decreased dramatically. Moreover, some kinds of virus such as west Nile virus, Parainfluenza and SARS like coronaviruses were found in R. leschenaulti (Paul et al. 1970; Pavri et al. 1971; Li et al. 2005), it has a direct effect on human health. Although it has a close relationship with human, few researches on R. leschenaulti involve its population studies by molecular means. In order to study the genetic structure of R. leschenaulti with effective molecular markers, we isolated microsatellite loci from a DNA library enriched for (CA)n repeats. This study reports the isolation and characterization of these loci and the genetic polymorphism in a population from Guangxi, China.",

            "text": "The specimens of R. leschenaulti were collected from the cave of Yiling in Guangxi, south China. Genomic DNA was extracted from the muscle tissue with the DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). The enrichment method for isolating CA repeats was based on Kandpal et al. (1994) and Karp et al. (1998) with some modifications. The genomic DNA extracted from R. leschenaulti was digested with MboI, and the fragments between 400 and 800 bp were cut out from an agarose gel and purified with DNA Purification Kit (TaKaRa). The selected fragments were ligated to linker sequences and amplified by using linker specific primers. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was denatured and hybridized with biotin\u2010labelled dinucleotide repeat oligonucleotides (CA)15 probe. The hybridization mixture was mixed with VECTREX Avidin D (Vector Laboratories). After successively washing for four times with buffer A (150 mm NaCl/100 mm Tris, pH = 7.5) at different temperatures to remove the unbound fragments, the matrix was washed with dH2O to elute the bound fragments and the supernatant was retained. A PCR was performed to amplify the targeted genomic fragments and the product was ligated to pMD19\u2010T vector (TaKaRa). Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 competent cells were transformed with the ligation product to construct the (CA)n\u2010enriched DNA library. Out of 135 recombinant colonies, 53 positive clones were identified using linker primers and M13 universal primers amplification. They were selected for sequencing with M13 primers (Invitrogen). According to the microsatellite insert sequences, primers flanking microsatellite repeats for PCR amplification were designed using the primer premier 5.0 software (PREMIER Biosoft International) and primer 3 (Rozen & Skaletsky 2000) (see Table 1). The PCR conditions were optimized through gradient PCR amplification.",

The reactions were performed using the following conditions: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing temperature for 30 s (see Table 1), 72 \u00b0C for 40 s, with a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. The PCR products were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide : bis\u2010acrylamide, 1\u00d7 TBE, 120 V for 12\u201314 h) and displayed with silver nitrate staining (Allen & Budowle 1989).

Expected and observed heterozygosities, Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium test and linkage disequilibrium (LD) were analysed with genepop version 3.4 software (Raymond & Rousset 1995). The results showed that expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.85 (M3\u20101) to 0.94 (M3\u20106). The mean observed heterozygosity (0.885) was not significantly different from the mean expected heterozygosity (0.899). No locus pair showed significant LD (P < 0.05) among the seven loci.",
