Nonetheless, we explain the usefulness, in these situations, of qualitative insights from mathematical decision theory. We demonstrate the integration of info-gap robustness in decision problems in which surprise and ignorance are predominant and where personal and collective psychological factors are critical. We present practical guidelines for employing adaptable-choice strategies as a proxy for robustness against uncertainty. These guidelines include being prepared for more surprises than we intuitively expect, retaining sufficiently many options to avoid premature closure and conflicts among preferences, and prioritizing outcomes that are steerable, whose consequences are observable, and that do not entail sunk costs, resource depletion, or high transition costs. We illustrate these concepts and guidelines with the example of the medical management of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Vietnam.",

For instance, the population dynamics of TB is altered in conflicting and uncertain ways by the presence of HIV/AIDS. On the one hand, HIV/AIDS enhances the spread of TB by making individuals more vulnerable to infection. On the other hand, HIV/AIDS is a major cause of death and can thereby reduce the spread of TB. These conflicting tendencies make it challenging (though not impossible) to use quantitative epidemiological models of TB to formulate public health policy in the presence of HIV/AIDS. For instance, if prevention of HIV/AIDS is enhanced, existing TB models do not always provide clear indication of whether intervention against TB can be reduced or must be enhanced, and by how much. Nonetheless, the main features of the disease are understood, and existing TB models can be usefully employed by robustifying them against uncertainties resulting from HIV/AIDS. (5) The situation with a new disease is quite different. Consider, for instance, the 2003 SARS outbreak in Vietnam, as described by Plant. (6) The infectious organism was unidentified and public health officials did not know the clinical course (\"Would everyone die?\"), the mechanism of spread, the timing of recovery and infectiousness, and other elements that are crucial for disease management. As Plant writes: \"Despite these unknowns, we had to make decisions-who to admit to hospital, how to manage their clinical course and what to advise their relatives or the health staff looking after them.\" Mathematical models, as well as much requisite scientific knowledge, are unavailable when these decisions must be made.",

The high uncertainty of analogical reasoning motivates the strategy of learning and adapting, as the SARS team did very explicitly. The SARS team had to gather more information (including surprises) to resolve the issue of when to \"think outside the box\" or to continue reasoning analogically from past experience. Plant also indicates an adaptive approach to resolving uncertainties, saying that questions about why the outbreak occurred and possible health system failures had to await the identification of the virus, inventing a test for it, and determining its modes of transmission.",

Thus, a major proportion of the team's resources and time were devoted to obtaining new information. Implicit is the recognition that treatment decisions and policies had to be malleable as new information came in, and that other options might need to be kept open. The team also was aware that new information might not immediately resolve uncertainties and could even generate new ones: \"Even as information accumulates, we may still not know how to interpret that information. Other examples of how additional information could add to uncertainty are found in postepidemic accounts such as Johnston and Conly. (21) They noted that while the majority of data indicated contagion by droplet and contact, at least two clusters of cases suggested the possibility of airborne spread.

A few of the coping styles in her list correspond to our descriptions of DA and DO, both of which are types of indecision. We recognize that anxiety is likely to be a major concern for decisionmakers under extreme uncertainty and pressure. However, our discussion of indecision focused on factors contributing to the difficulty of selecting among alternatives, and a full discussion of ways of dealing with anxiety is beyond our scope.
