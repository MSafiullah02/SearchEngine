Ocular manifestations of viral disease are many and varied, depending on the inciting pathogen. Familiarity with the clinical and ocular manifestations of the common viral pathogens of cats might help to direct diagnostic testing and therapy. This review describes the most common feline viral infections that could have an ocular manifestation, how to recognize which viral pathogen might be responsible, therapeutic options for treating ocular disease and prognosis.",

Cats affected by both primary infection and viral recrudescence are likely to have ocular disease. Conjunctivitis is the most common ocular condition (Fig. 1\n), followed by corneal epithelial ulceration and keratitis, with or without ulceration (Fig. 2\n). Conjunctivitis is manifested by conjunctival hyperemia, with or without chemosis, tearing and discomfort. The nictitating membrane can sometimes be elevated due to pain or swelling. The early inflammatory response is neutrophilic and a purulent ocular discharge is common. Dendritic epithelial corneal ulceration is the classic herpetic lesion and, if evident, is helpful in making the diagnosis. However, many cats with FHV-1-related ocular disease are presented with geographic epithelial ulcers. Both of these types of epithelial ulcers can be seen after staining with fluorescein. Rose Bengal will highlight dendritic ulcers, but is irritating and a topical anesthetic should be used before this stain is applied. Keratitis without corneal ulceration can also occur in cats, manifesting as corneal vascularization, with or without inflammatory cell infiltrates (Fig. 2). Corneal disease from FHV-1 is almost always accompanied by conjunctivitis.",

These conditions are more likely to occur with chronic FHV-1-associated ocular disease. Typically, primary infection with FHV-1 is self-limiting, lasting a few weeks, followed by clinical recovery. However, some cats develop chronic conjunctivitis that does not resolve spontaneously. Chronic conjunctivitis, or recurrent conjunctivitis, can occur bilaterally, but it is not uncommon for only one eye to be affected. This might lead the clinician to erroneously assume that FHV-1 could not be the underlying pathogen.",

A history of recurrent episodes of conjunctivitis or corneal ulceration, especially if accompanied by sneezing, might allow for a presumptive diagnosis. Conjunctival cytology, if performed in the early phase of the disease, will show a neutrophilic inflammation. As the disease becomes more chronic, a mixed pattern of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells will be seen. Eosinophils and occasional mast cells might also be present. Intranuclear viral inclusions are generally not visible.",

Samples from both the eye and oropharynx should be submitted. PCR is highly sensitive and specific, although variability amongst laboratories exists. However, a negative test does not rule out FHV-1 as the inciting agent, nor does a positive test prove that the virus is the cause of clinical signs. Several studies have demonstrated that cats with clinically normal eyes can have positive PCR results for FHV-1 from conjunctival samples (Stiles et al, 1997, Burgesser et al, 1999). However, a positive PCR result in the face of clinical disease consistent with FHV-1 should allow the clinician to proceed with reasonable certainty of a correct diagnosis. If diagnostic testing is not performed, or if results are negative in the face of clinical disease consistent with that caused by FHV-1, anti-viral therapy can be instituted and the response to treatment determined.",

Corneal ulcers caused by FHV-1 alone should only involve the epithelium. If a stromal ulcer exists, a secondary bacterial pathogen is likely and would need more aggressive antibiotic therapy than would be instituted for a viral ulcer. Any loose epithelium should be removed by debridement with a cotton swab. Grid keratotomies should not be performed in cats, as this might worsen herpetic disease and lead to formation of a corneal sequestrum (La Croix et al., 2001). A broad-spectrum topical antibiotic, such as tobramycin, should be used if epithelial ulceration is present. Cleansing the eyes and removing discharge regularly is important.",

            "text": "Available anti-herpetic drugs are summarized in Table 1\n. Many of the topical anti-viral compounds are not available commercially or are available only in certain countries. Cidofovir is an intravenous drug used in human medicine for treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis (Ahmed, 2011) and is the author's preferred topical drug in cats. Compounded into a 0.5% ophthalmic solution, it is efficacious against FHV-1 and is stable when stored frozen or refrigerated for at least 6 months (Fontanelle et al, 2008, Stiles et al, 2010). Additional benefits include lack of ocular irritation and a long tissue half-life, so that twice daily administration is adequate (Sandmeyer et al, 2005, Van der Meulen et al, 2006). Acyclovir has a low efficacy against FHV-1 compared to its efficacy against human herpes simplex virus (HSV), and is not recommended for treatment of cats (Nasisse et al, 1989, Van der Meulen et al, 2006). Idoxuridine, trifluridine and ganciclovir are all effective (Nasisse et al, 1989, Maggs, Clarke, 2004), but need to be used 4\u20136 times daily and can cause ocular irritation. The use of oral famciclovir (prodrug of the active agent penciclovir), frequently used for treating HSV, has become more commonly used in cats. It has been shown to be both safe and effective for short periods of 2\u20133 weeks (Thomasy et al., 2011); however, the optimal dose remains uncertain. The most recent information indicates that 40 mg/kg three times daily is likely to be effective (Thomasy et al., 2012), although, anecdotally, lower doses and frequencies are reported to be effective by some veterinary clinicians. A recent study of high dose topical recombinant human \u03b12b and feline \u03c9 interferon in a group of cats with naturally occurring viral keratoconjunctivitis found no beneficial effect of either interferon compared to placebo (Slack et al., 2013); thus, this treatment cannot be recommended.",

In theory, excess ingestion of l-lysine will lead to decreased replication of FHV-1 through reduction in viral protein synthesis. In a placebo controlled experimental study, cats receiving 500 mg l-lysine every 12 h had less severe conjunctivitis than control cats (Stiles et al., 2002). In a study in which shelter cats were given 250 mg (kittens) or 500 mg (adults) l-lysine once daily in food, there was no difference in URTD in treated cats compared to untreated cats (Rees and Lubinski, 2008). In another study, shelter cats fed a diet high in l-lysine (5.7%) had no difference in the frequency of URTD signs compared to cats eating a diet with basal levels of l-lysine (1.7%) (Drazenovich et al., 2009). Anecdotally, it appears that some cats might benefit more than others from the administration of l-lysine. If this therapy is elected, a dose of 500 mg (adults) or 250 mg (kittens) twice daily with food should be used.",

Moderate to severe conjunctivitis with conjunctival epithelial erosions, as well as oral mucosal ulceration, were noted in FCV-positive cats. No corneal ulcers were noted in cats infected with only FCV. In the author's experience, some cats with FCV infection have severe conjunctivitis that often precludes visualization of the cornea (Fig. 3\n).

Specific anti-viral treatment with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers has been used in FCV outbreaks, reducing viral shedding and hastening clinical recovery (Smith et al., 2008). A topical ophthalmic anti-viral agent should be used when it is unknown whether FCV or FHV-1 (or both) are present. A topical broad spectrum ophthalmic antibiotic, such as tobramycin, should also be used, since erosions of the conjunctival epithelium are vulnerable to bacterial infection. Cleansing the eyes and removing discharge regularly is important. The most severe ocular manifestations of FCV tend to recede in a few weeks, although topical anti-inflammatory therapy might be needed, as described for infection with FHV-1.",

In 12 cats experimentally infected with FIV, virus was recovered from the aqueous humor of three animals, and a perivascular lymphoplasmacytic uveitis was noted in all nine animals euthanased \u22654 weeks post-infection (Ryan et al., 2003). The magnitude and distribution of lesions in the eyes and brain did not correlate with viral loads. In a study of 15 naturally infected cats that had been euthanased, anterior uveitis was documented in 13 (Loesenbeck et al., 1996). The presence of extravascular IgG and complement component C3 suggested that immune complexes might play a role in anterior uveitis in FIV-positive cats. Nine cats with naturally occurring FIV had ocular lesions, including anterior uveitis, secondary glaucoma and inflammation of the pars plana of the ciliary body (English et al., 1990). In an experimental study on the effect of FIV on the central nervous system, neurologic abnormalities related to the visual system included anisocoria, delayed pupillary light reflex and delayed visual evoked potentials (Phillips et al., 1994).",

FCoV antigen was detected in the conjunctiva of the nictitating membrane in 90% of cats and persisted throughout the investigation. Virus isolation was also positive from swabs of the nictitating membrane, suggesting that ocular exudates from these cats were potentially infectious. When kittens serologically negative for FCoV were placed in catteries with a history of FIP and observed for 100 days, there was 100% morbidity and 90% mortality, with affected kittens developing recurrent bouts of conjunctivitis, URTD and gastrointestinal signs (Hok, 1993b).",

When the uveitis has improved, it might be possible to switch to a topical NSAID for maintenance therapy. Combination therapy with a topical corticosteroid and a topical NSAID is safe and helpful in many cases by allowing the steroid to be used less frequently, and by treating the inflammation with two classes of drugs, each that alters the inflammatory cascade by a different mechanism (Holmberg, Maggs, 2004, Giuliano, 2004).",
