In underdeveloped countries, the incidence and mortality of acute diarrhea is greatest in children. In Latin America, for example, the incidence is approximately 2.7 diarrheal episodes per year in the first 2 years of life (3). Factors thought to increase morbidity and mortality in developing countries have been reviewed (4). Acute diarrhea is also a common problem in the United States and Western Europe, with an incidence of approximately one episode per person per year (5). A comparison of common causes of acute infectious diarrhea in the western world and less-developed countries is shown in Table 2.\n",

Infection with these agents can alter the normal absorptive and secretory processes of the enterocyte, leading to watery diarrhea.

Patients usually respond promptly to treatment with oral metronidazole or oral vancomycin, although approximately 10% to 20% of treated patients have a relapse of symptoms, usually within 5 weeks after completion of therapy.

Enterotoxigenic E. coli produce disease by adherence to the mucosa and the production of toxins, which may be heat labile or heat stable. Their distribution is worldwide and accounts for most cases of traveler\u2019s diarrhea. Enteropathogenic E. coli have been associated primarily with diarrhea in children <2 years old, although they can cause traveler\u2019s diarrhea. Enteroinvasive E. coli can invade mucosa and can produce a dysentery-like syndrome similar to Shigella. Enteroadherent E. coli are the most poorly understood; they may cause persistent diarrhea in children. These four types of diarrheagenic E. coli are rarely diagnosed, because the necessary laboratory tests are not routinely available. Infection with enterohemorrhagic E. coli is characterized by colitis with bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis), which may be complicated by the hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Although it can be caused by different serotypes of E. coli that elaborate Shiga-like toxins, serotype 0157:H7 is the most common type. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection is both endemic and epidemic in the United States. It is transmitted by food, most commonly ground meat, and it can be isolated easily by hospital laboratories, through the use of Sorbitol-MacConkey agar and specific typing serum.

            "text": "Most cases of acute diarrhea are self-limited, and specific therapy is not necessary. Therapy should be directed at preventing dehydration and restoring fluid losses. Although this is often done intravenously, it can also be accomplished with oral fluid\u2013electrolyte therapy. Oral intake should be encouraged to minimize the risk of dehydration. The misconception that the bowel needs to be at rest or that oral intake will worsen the diarrheal illness should be abandoned. It is important, however, to avoid milk and other lactose-containing products, because viral or bacterial enteropathogens often result in transient lactase deficiency, leading to lactose malabsorption. Caffeine-containing products should be avoided, because caffeine increases cyclic AMP levels, thus promoting secretion of fluid and worsening diarrhea.",

These are commonly used and frequently suffice in patients with mild, self-limited diarrhea. However, in patients with dehydration or large-volume diarrhea, these remedies should be avoided, because the fluids are hyperosmolar and deficient in electrolytes and thus are poor replacements for diarrheal losses. Rather, glucose-containing electrolyte solutions should be used. Glucose in the intestinal lumen facilitates the absorption of sodium and, thereby, of water (7). This co-transport mechanism is usually unaffected by infectious microorganisms or their toxins. Several oral rehydration solutions have been developed to take advantage of the glucose-sodium\u2013coupled transport mechanism (Table 4\n). Several are commercially available and are strongly recommended for use in adults as well as children.",

The most commonly used agents include opiates and opiate derivatives (loperamide and diphenoxylate), bismuth subsalicylate, and kaolin-containing agents. The major effect of opiate derivatives is to slow the intestinal transit time, although they also possess a pro-absorptive or antisecretory effect in the intestine (21). Anticholinergic agents are not effective for controlling symptoms and may cause significant adverse side effects. They are therefore not recommended. Adsorbent agents such as Kaopectate (Attapulgite) and stool texture modifiers are used frequently in over-the-counter medications, but their efficacy is uncertain.",

The usefulness of antibiotic therapy for other organisms, such as Yersinia, Campylobacter, and outbreaks of enteropathogenic E. coli, is less clear but is generally recommended (Table 5\n). Specific antibiotics and dosages are discussed in a recent review (23). However, because of the widespread use of antibiotics, many isolates of C. jejuni, Shigella, and Salmonella are resistant to many antibiotics. Thus, the choice of antibiotics should, whenever possible, be based on the antibiotic sensitivity patterns in the patient\u2019s community.",
