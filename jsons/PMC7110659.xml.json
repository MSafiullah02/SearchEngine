            "text": "The Utah plan looked at additional critical issues and provided greater planning detail. These included:1.Hospital bed capacity, staffing, equipmenta.Increasing hospital bed capacityThe obvious first step in finding space for new patients would be to start with identifying which patients could be removed from an institution. Depending on the nature of the MCI, hospitals in the region or throughout the state might have to cancel elective procedures and discharge patients awaiting elective procedures or with nonemergency problems. Hospitals may establish agreements with other nearby medical facilities, such as surgical centers and nursing homes, to accept certain categories of patients during an MCI. Task Force members emphasized the need to use a standardized triage system, such as the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) system, to control the admission of any new patients during an MCI.\nb.Burn injury and treatmentIt was stressed that definitive care for burn patients could be delayed if receiving medical facilities initiated appropriate fluid resuscitation. The Intermountain Burn Center will be used for initial logging and triage of all burn patients, including those from outlying facilities. Direct contact between the treating physicians and the Intermountain Burn Center will be used to ascertain the number and status of burn patients. Patients with significant injuries who could not be cared for locally or at the Intermountain Burn Center are to be transported to one of the several burn centers in the Western United States. Referral to a burn center is to be coordinated and organized through the Intermountain Burn Center. Should that facility be lost, the UDOH would contact the American Burn Association to gain support from other national burn centers.Definitive care for burn patients could be delayed if receiving medical facilities initiated appropriate fluid resuscitation.\nc.Space for additional bedsThe UDOH can authorize a 20% increase in hospital bed capacity during emergency conditions, resulting in approval for 830 additional beds in the state. All hospitals are expected to have areas designated that can be used for patient care during an MCI, such as converting private rooms into multi-bed rooms. In 2003, UDOH used HRSA funds to provide state hospitals with decontamination/ isolation structures. Additionally, the UDOH has 50 anterooms that can turn designated areas into negative pressure high-efficiency particulate air filtered treatment areas.UDOH has 8 tractor-trailers designated as Disaster Response Units, each of which contain 100 cots, linens, intravenous tubing, generators, lights, supplies, and 250 N-95 respirators. These can be dispatched to any facility as needed. Prototypes of alternate care facilities have been developed by manufacturers of theater stage sets that include heating, ventilation, air conditioning, water, and sewage and can be functioning within hours of an event. After considerable discussion, Task Force members agreed that attempting to meet patient care needs during an MCI inside of a converted convention center or gymnasium would not be practicable and would severely compromise patient care.UDOH has 8 tractor-trailers designated as Disaster Response Units.\nd.Additional staffing needsUDOH will develop a plan to recruit additional staff from staffing agencies and from retired personnel. This group will include professional staff and necessary support personnel. The department also will establish procedures for identification and credentialing of those working in other than their usual place of employment. If necessary, UDOH will request assistance from the National Nurse Response Team, a specialty Disaster Medical Assistance Team under the National Disaster Medical System. Each National Nurse Response Team consists of approximately 200 civilian nurses who can be mobilized in an emergency.\ne.Hospital staffing shortagesIt is recommended that each hospital use a 12-hour \u201con\u201d and 12-hour \u201coff\u201d schedule for A and B teams during the initial days of a disaster. A \u201cwork-home quarantine system,\u201d as used during the SARS epidemic in Toronto, may be needed for hospital workers during a biologic or emerging infection situation.18 This system required workers to be screened before entering the hospital and again before leaving. Food and sundries were brought into the hospital for purchase so that the workers did not have to go to stores in the community to purchase supplies. When the employees were in their homes, they were instructed to try to sleep in different rooms to avoid unnecessary contact with other family members.\nf.Hospital smallpox responseAll hospitals should be prepared to care for smallpox patients and should vaccinate a small number of hospital personnel so that they could act as a Smallpox Reaction Team. In the event of a confirmed smallpox patient, hospitals should identify a larger number of people for vaccination.\ng.Equipment and suppliesAgreements should be developed on a regional and statewide basis for sharing of equipment and supplies. Hospitals will be responsible for tracking such exchanges so that reimbursement can be provided later. A form to facilitate tracking is provided in Appendix L of the Utah plan. In planning for biologic events, hospitals should stock at least two N-95 respirators per each staff member. UDOH currently is a member of the Mid-American Alliance, a regional mutual assistance group consisting of 10 states from Department of Health and Human Services Regions VII and VIII. Participants will provide assistance during a disaster through pre-established agreements.\n\n2.OvercrowdingHealth care providers are likely to encounter overcrowding during a MCI due to patients coming by transport and self-referral. The following aspects of overcrowding are considered:a.Demand exceeds capacity to transport: When EMS services are overwhelmed, UDOH will request assistance from the Utah Department of Transportation and the Utah Transit Authority. The hospitals' status reports, submitted every 2 hours, will provide UDOH information to decide when patient transfers are required. The START triage system will be used to determine priorities for patient transport.When EMS services are overwhelmed, UDOH will request assistance from the Utah Department of Transportation and the Utah Transit Authority.b.Delivery and transfer of patients: Separate locations will be established by each hospital for patient drop-off and pick-up for transfer. Hospital security personnel must ensure that vehicles are directed to proper locations.c.Additional beds in state: In addition to the 830 beds provided by the 20% increase in authorized beds, analysis of hospital daily census data indicate that an additional 1237 vacant beds would be available in the state. Thus, the 1250 target can be met through these 2 sources. However, the numbers reflect all beds in the state, so hospitals must be prepared to manage excess numbers until transportation can be arranged by UDOH.\n3.Patient flow processa.Transfer of patientsDuring an MCI, patients may have to be transferred to create additional available beds. If this action is necessary, UDOH will coordinate transfer of patients. Transferring hospitals should provide hard copies of radiologic studies, scans, or other studies rather than only the radiologists' reports. Paper copies of studies should accompany the patients.\nb.Lines of communicationIt is essential that all medical treatment facilities and health departments that will play a role in an MCI coordinate roles and responsibilities before the event and clearly define lines of communication. The coordination will require written Memoranda of Understanding or Memoranda of Agreement, with the latter being preferred as the former may be open to different interpretations. Additionally, as noted in Appendix A of the Surge Capacity Plan, statutory authority will be needed to protect providers and others involved in an MCI response.\n\n4.Patient TrackingDuring a biologic event, local health departments will report numbers of patients and contact tracing information to UDOH. UDOH will communicate event information to the CDC. During an all-hazards event, individual hospitals will report numbers of patients and requests for assistance, including the need for transportation of patients to other facilities, to UDOH. UDOH does not require names of patients in order to focus on appropriate response to the evolving situation.\n5.EquipmentStaff must be identified, trained, and fit tested so that they can properly use personal protective equipment. All acute care hospitals in the state have received funding for personal protective equipment and decontamination showers. They must include use of these modalities in their response plans.\n6.PharmaceuticalsThe UDOH has established several pharmaceutical stockpiles. These stockpiles are integrated into some of the largest pharmacies in the state so that medications in the caches will not expire. UDOH has pre-deployed 330,000 three day doses of prophylactic antibiotics for first responders in these caches. UDOH will access the Strategic National Stockpile as necessary.UDOH has pre-deployed 330,000 three day doses of prophylactic antibiotics for first responders in these caches.\n7.Hospital SecurityControl of patients, family members and other visitors, and vehicle traffic will be a major challenge during an MCI. Normal hospital security will not be able to manage the rapid arrival of several hundred to more than 1000 patients, relatives, and \u201cworried well,\u201d as previously described. Police likely will be involved directly in the MCI and will be unable to divert resources to maintain a hospital perimeter. Plans must be made to augment hospital security personnel with members of private security or other agencies to provide security. Assistance from the National Guard will require time, needs to be coordinated through UDOH and the State EOC, and may be unavailable because of other requirements, such as the present situation in Iraq. Statutory authority will be required to define identification procedures to permit persons responding to their usual workplace or other locations to pass police lines. Two forms of identification, one a state government picture ID and the other a photo ID from a hospital, health department, or other health organization, could be used as a standardized identification technique.\n8.Medical Waste DisposalBoth the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the Department of Environmental Quality require hospitals to have plans to contain waste during decontamination or other medical activities. Assistance is also available at the Web site for the CDC at www.cdc.gov.\n9.Overview of Terrorism Response OrganizationAn overview of the hospital organization to respond to an MCI was developed.\n10.AppendicesThe subjects of the appendices are listed in the previous article.1 A summary discussion of each appendix can be found at http://rocky.utah.edu through the \u201cSurge Capacity Appendices\u201d link.\n\n",
