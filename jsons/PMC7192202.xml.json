            "text": "Effective antiviral therapy for viral RTI is problematic. First, there are the inherent limitations in the number of available agents. Second, antiviral therapy is generally not recommended for healthy immunocompetent individuals because benefits on the clinical course of the disease are often limited. For example, while treatment of influenza by amantadine or neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) does shorten the duration of illness, the benefit is a mere one day if only the antiviral are given within 48 h after the onset of disease. Clinical benefits of antiviral treatment are likely to be greater in immunocompromised patients with more severe diseases. Third, early institution of antivirals is essential to limit the multiplication of viruses and the concomitant tissue damage and activation of the pro\u2010inflammatory response. Unfortunately, unlike most of the common bacterial pathogens in which aetiological identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing can be completed within a few days and proper empirical antibacterial coverage generally covers most of the relevant pathogens, rapid viral diagnosis is only possible for a handful of agents. Although PCR and RT\u2010PCR broadened the range of pathogens that can be detected, these are still not widely available in most routine laboratories and they usually do not offer same\u2010day testing results. Antiviral susceptibility testing is virtually non\u2010existent under such settings, though genotypic testing for mutations conferring resistance can be done rapidly in some centres.",

The reasons include the usual delay of more than 48 h from onset of illness to medical attention, difficulties in differentiating influenza from other viral RTI, potential for antiviral resistance, cost of the medications and potential adverse reactions to the drugs. Although antiviral treatment for influenza is available, all the currently available agents must be given within 48 h (preferably 36 h or less) after the onset of illness to be effective. This can be explained by the dynamics of viral multiplication and shedding of influenza viruses. Influenza is generally a very acute infection. Incubation period of influenza is about 48 h (ranges 24\u201396 h), and shedding of viruses from the respiratory tract peaks at 24\u201372 h after infection. This means that virus shedding is already substantial even before the onset of illness. Early diagnosis of influenza is therefore crucial if antiviral therapy is going to be effective. However, specific virological diagnosis is often not available in the primary care setting. The clinical diagnosis of influenza is usually made as ILI, the definition of which also varies between different studies and surveillance programmes. Agents other than influenza viruses and the proportion of ILI cases caused by influenza viruses are affected by the seasonality of different infections. The positive predictive value of ILI for confirmed influenza varies from 30% to 87% during influenza seasons, while the figure drops to 23\u201330% during off\u2010seasons.\n157\n, \n158\n, \n159\n, \n160\n, \n161\n Thus, antiviral treatment of influenza is usually only recommended for at\u2010risk patients and those who develop severe disease and complications.\n162\n\n",

The first report came from Japan where oseltamivir resistance was encountered in up to 18% of A/H3N2 viruses from children being treated with oseltamivir.\n184\n In the 2004\u20132005 season, FLUBV with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir was detected in Japan.\n185\n In the 2005\u20132006 season in France, two human A/H1N1 isolates were found to be resistant to zanamivir, one A/H1N1 isolate was resistant to oseltamivir but susceptible to zanamivir, and an FLUBV isolate was resistant to both zanamivir and oseltamivir.\n186\n In the 2007\u20132008 season, a high prevalence of oseltamivir resistance was reported among human A/H1N1 viruses in at least nine European countries; overall, 14% of 437 strains tested were resistant to oseltamivir (range 6\u201370%).\n187\n The H274Y mutation in the NA gene is responsible for some of the cases of oseltamivir resistance seen in Europe. The emergence of oseltamivir resistance among A/H5N1 viruses is also alarming. The first case was described in a Vietnamese girl who had received 4 days of post\u2010exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis. The level of resistance apparently did not lead to treatment failure.\n188\n Subsequently, two more Vietnamese patients were found to have infection due to oseltamivir\u2010resistant A/H5N1 viruses.\n3\n In the patients who died from oseltamivir\u2010resistant A/H5N1 infections, a rising viral load was detected in their throat swabs.\n189\n A study involving A/H5N1 viruses of avian origins in Southeast Asia obtained in 2005 showed that while all the viruses were susceptible to zanamivir and all clade 1 isolates from 2004 were susceptible to oseltamivir, some clade 1 isolates from Cambodia and some clade 2 isolates from Indonesia in 2005 showed a 15\u2010 to 30\u2010fold reduction in oseltamivir susceptibility.\n190\n\n",

            "text": "Resistance to the NAI occur as a result of mutations in the NA gene of the virus. A number of mutations have been described; a common mutation is H274Y, which is found in N1 viruses and confers high\u2010level resistance to oseltamivir.\n191\n, \n192\n With few exceptions, most of the oseltamivir\u2010resistant influenza viruses (including those with the H274Y mutation) remained susceptible to zanamivir. The lack of cross\u2010resistance between these two NAI is due to the differences in their chemical structure and binding properties to the NA molecule.\n193\n Oseltamivir has a hydrophobic pentyloxy substitution at the C6 position while zanamivir has a polar glycerol group. Binding of oseltamivir to the wild\u2010type NA molecule requires a conformational change in the NA to accommodate the hydrophobic side\u2010chain, while such a change is not necessary for the binding of zanamivir. The H274Y mutation prevents this conformational change from occurring, thereby conferring resistance to oseltamivir but does not affect the binding of zanamivir. Earlier experiments demonstrated the reduced fitness of NAI\u2010resistant viruses in vitro and in animal studies. A/H3N2 viruses with NA mutations of R292K and E119V as well as A/H1N1 with H274Y have lower transmissibility, infectivity and pathogenicity in ferrets, as well as reduced replication in vitro.\n194\n, \n195\n, \n196\n, \n197\n However, the loss in fitness and virulence is not a uniform characteristic of all NAI\u2010resistant mutants, and close monitoring for their pathogenicity is essential.\n198\n, \n199\n In view of the increasing concern for oseltamivir\u2010resistant influenza viruses, relative rarity of zanamivir\u2010resistant isolates especially among A/H5N1, and the difficulty in administering zanamivir powder to the severely ill patient, other modes of therapy need to be explored. A special preparation of zanamivir in saline was used for nebulization in a study and was well tolerated.\n200\n Nebulized zanamivir may improve the delivery of drugs to the LRT in severely ill patients and those put on mechanical ventilation. In preclinical trials, intravenous zanamivir has been given at very high doses to volunteers and was well tolerated.\n201\n, \n202\n The availability of an intravenous formulation of zanamivir can prove life\u2010saving in patients suffering from severe disseminated infections by yielding high drug concentrations both in the consolidated lungs and at other extra\u2010pulmonary foci of infection.",

The influenza viruses are unique in their pandemic potential, and others are notable for having an animal reservoir (as in AIV and SARS\u2010CoV).

            "text": "Antiviral agents are available for some of these pathogens. The herpesviruses are often susceptible to the guanosine analogues (such as acyclovir), ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir. Ribavirin is a broad\u2010spectrum agent active on many RNA and some DNA viruses. Influenza viruses are specifically targeted by the adamantanes and NAI. The interferons deserve more intensive investigations to assess their therapeutic and prophylactic roles. Unfortunately, only a few of these agents have undergone stringent clinical trials to assess their clinical efficacies. The choice of a specific agent is often based on in vitro susceptibility and clinical experience, sometimes supported by efficacies in experimental animal models. Randomized controlled trials are, however, not always feasible, especially in life\u2010threatening infections. Immunological agents may become an important aspect in the therapy or prophylaxis of some infections. Examples include the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of SARS and A/H5N1 infections. Palivizumab is a successful example in this respect. In general, life\u2010threatening infections such as HCMV pneumonitis and A/H5N1 infections must be treated with antivirals despite the lack of clinical trials in some settings. For other respiratory viruses, antiviral treatment is often recommended only for immunocompromised individuals or for severe infections in the competent host. In some viral RTI, such as SARS and avian influenza infections due to FLUAV A/H5N1, immunopathological damage or excessive activation of the pro\u2010inflammatory cascade is thought to contribute to the organ damage and mortality. Immunomodulating agents are used for these infections in the hope of reducing these tissue damages. Corticosteroids are the most commonly used of these agents because of the potency in suppressing inflammatory reactions. However, the value of corticosteroids has not been encouraging for most of theses infections. One possibility for the lack of beneficial effects of corticosteroids could be the broad and non\u2010specific suppressive effects on the immune system, which may also inhibit the protective cellular immunity crucial to control viral multiplication. Corticosteroids or other immunomodulators should be used only when an effective antiviral agent is available, lest the immunosuppression may lead to uncontrolled viral replication. More targeted modulation of the immune system should be explored in the future.",
