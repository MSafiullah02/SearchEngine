These glycoproteins, which are called biliary glycoproteins, were highly expressed in B lymphocytes, including cells of the B-la (CD5+) lineage, and in macrophages, but were not detectable in resting T lymphocytes. Similarly, murine cell lines of B cell and macrophage origin expressed messenger RNA encoding CEA-related molecules, while the corresponding mRNA was only slightly detectable in a T cell line. These CEA-related cell adhesion glycoproteins were also expressed in endothelial cells. Therefore, their specific interaction with their so far unknown ligand may be of functional importance in cellular interactions in the immune response. Monoclonal antibody directed against these glycoproteins blocked MHV-A59 infection of the B cell-derived SP20 cell line. Thus, the functional receptors for MHV on B lymphocytes, like those on murine fibroblasts, are isoforms of CEA-related glycoproteins.Treatment of B cells with anti-receptor antibody also blocked B cell-mediated cytotoxicity against MHV-Ai59-infected fibroblasts, indicating that this phenomenon is mediated by interaction of viral attachment protein on the infected target cells with specific CEA-related receptor glycoproteins on the effector B cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Efficiency of the immune system relies on the development of an appropriate communication network between various cell types.

Because in other systems, mouse CEA-related molecules, as well as rat cell-CAM 105 and human CEA, have been shown to participate in intercellular adhesion [2, 3, 5, 291 , their expression on the membrane of cells which all require close contact with T lymphocytes for physiological functions, suggests that these glycoproteins play a role in recognition and binding to Tcells. If so, then a ligand for these molecules might be found on T lymphocytes. infected with MHV-A59, we found no loss of B cells from the spleen, which contrasts with the splenolysis resulting from MHV-3 infection of C57BY6 B lymphocytes [59, 601.

CEA expression has been observed in human B cell lymphomas and in Epstein-Barr immortalized B cell lines [30] and a related protein, CD66, is expressed in human neutrophils and epithelial cells, but not in lymphocytes or monocytes [31] . A cell adhesion molecule homologous to human CD22 that was recently identified in murine B lymphocytes shows limited homology to MHV receptors and to CEA [32] . CD22 has seven Ig-like domains and is considerably larger than the MHVR-related glycoproteins which have either two or four domains. CD22 mediates binding of B lymphocytes to monocytes, T cells and B cells . It may facilitate antigen recognition [33] , regulate T cell receptor/CD3-induced signaling [36] and promote B cell activation and proliferation in association with tyrosine phosphorylation [37- [53] . One might therefore expect that cells bearing these adhesion molecules can be infected, or that their function can be altered, when exposed to the viruses which recognize these molecules as receptors. Thus, it has been known for many years that MHV strains can infect macrophages [54] , so it was not surprising to find that these cells express the CEA-related glycorpoteins that serve in vivo as receptors for MHV in fibroblasts [55] In adult BALB/c animals A second biological function of the CEA-related MHVR glycoproteins on the B cell membrane, that of B cellmediated, MHV-specific cytotoxicity, is also associated with the virus receptor activity of murine BGP. MHV-A59-infected murine fibroblasts are killed rapidly and with high efficiency by incubation with splenocytes from BALBlc mice that have never been infected with MHVThis VK activity is not restricted by MHC and, surprisingly, the effector cells were shown to be B lymphocytes [15] . We previously showed that SJL/J B cells did not bind MHV-A59 virus or serve as effectors for VK activity and that treatment of MHV-A59-infected fibroblasts that serve as target cells with antibody directed against the viral spike glycoprotein blocked theVK activity [15] .This paper shows that treatment of the effector BALB/c spleen cells with anti-receptor antibody also blocked this VK activity, and that SP20 cells, which express MHVR, can serve as effector cells for VK activity.VK activity is associated with fusion of the virus-infected target cell with the effector B lymphocyte [25] , and MHV-induced fusion depends upon specific interaction of the viral spike glycoprotein with glycoprotein receptors related to MHVR. Thus, VK activity depends upon specific interaction of the virus glycoproteins with specific CEA-related glycoprotein receptors on B cell membranes.

This shows that isoforms of MHVR serve on cells of the B lineage as receptors for MHV-A59. Because the mAb completely blocked infection of the SP20 cells, we conclude that the MHVR isoforms are the only functional virus receptors expressed on these BALBlc cells.
