It is very successful, with 90.6% achieving better than driving standard vision (6/12 Snellen). Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) consistently demonstrate significant improvements in patients\u2019 experiences and quality of life [2]. However, poorer visual outcomes occur infrequently due to complications during surgery (often associated with posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss) or in the post-operative period (such as endophthalmitis, retinal detachment and cystoid macular oedema (CMO)) [3, 4].",

            "text": "CMO can also occur in the setting of uncomplicated cataract surgery, with published incidence rates ranging from 1.2\u20133.4% [5\u201310]. Known as Irvine-Gass syndrome for the past 60 years, patients commonly experience good vision in the immediate post-operative period, followed by a painless central visual deterioration a few weeks later [7]. CMO is believed to result from a post-operative inflammatory response [11]. The incidence of post-operative CMO peaks at 4\u20136 weeks, but most cases are self-limiting, though visual impairment can persist, with duration of CMO reported to range between 72 and 249 days [12]. Aside from the personal impact of visual impairment, the overall Medicare cost of modern cataract surgery complicated by CMO has been reported to be 47% higher than for those without [13]. It is generally accepted that the incidence of CMO has reduced significantly due to refinement in cataract surgical techniques, including the switch from extracapsular cataract surgery to phacoemulsification [14\u201316]. However, this incidence is variable, and further influenced by type (acute/chronic/persistent) and method of detection (clinical, angiographic, optical) [11]. For example, the incidence of angiographic CMO has been previously estimated to be as high as 30% in uncomplicated cataract surgery cases [11]. In addition, the widespread use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has increased the ability to detect both clinical and sub-clinical CMO, which could further influence quoted incidence rates [10, 17].",

The published literature suggested a variety of topical and systemic treatment modalities. These include use of topical NSAIDs, topical steroids, combination of topical NSAIDs and steroids, periocular steroid injections, systemic steroids, systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, intravitreal injections of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor agents (anti\u2013VEGF), intravitreal steroid injections, intravitreal steroid implants, and surgery in the form of pars plana vitrectomy [6, 7, 9, 14, 26, 31\u201337]. A recent review of CMO by McGhee\u2019s group in Auckland concluded that \u201cthere are limited evidence\u2010based clinical studies available regarding successful treatment strategies, and there is substantial inconsistency between studies in terms of defining successful outcome measures, with some focusing on improvements as measured by OCT or fluorescein angiography vs visual acuity outcomes\u201d [29]. They noted that visual improvement doesn\u2019t always correlate with angiographic improvement, and spontaneous resolution of CMO can be a major confounder in any attempted analysis of true treatment effects [29, 38].",

In this large RCT study investigating prevention (not treatment) of 914 patients, they discovered that patients treated with a combination of topical NSAID (bromfenac 0.09%) and topical steroid (dexamethasone 0.1%) had a lower risk for developing clinically significant macular oedema after cataract surgery than patients treated with a single drug. However, it should be noted that this study ended at 12 weeks and did not continue onto evaluate any patients with pCMO. While our study patients (looking at treatment) are different to the PREMED group (looking at prevention), 50% of our eight cases on combination topical NSAIDs and steroids treatment had resolution of CMO at 1-year post-op follow up. Of the other four remaining cases with pCMO, three had evidence of epi-retinal membrane causing cystic spaces on OCT scans at 1-year post-op.",

Such BOSU/SOSU surveillance studies are widely recognised to result in lower incidence rates than in real-life due to the inherent potential for under-reporting by observers [19]. Furthermore, because routine post-operative cataract reviews have been devolved to community optometry in Scotland, the identification rate may be lower from optometric practices without OCT. The SOSU methodology meant our study could only identify patients who had been referred back into the hospital system and were under the care of an ophthalmologist. We also have no knowledge of optometric independent prescribing behaviours, which could also have suppressed the incidence numbers. Our study had a follow-up of 18 months postoperatively, yet only identified 14 cases. It is difficult to develop management recommendations from such a small number. The patients originated from different Scottish Ophthalmology departments which use different OCT devices, which could influence the reporting of macular thickness, as some machines measure retinal thickness from the internal limiting membrane to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), while others use Bruchs membrane as the outer retinal boundary. It must be recognised that OCT interpretation on different machines is not standardised across the Scottish ophthalmic departments. Equally, it is not possible to standardise the follow up and review arrangements in each hospital for these patients, so we had to use the closest appointment information for the 3 month and 12 month post-operative data. In addition, bias due to failure to report can negatively impact any survey regarding the incidence of surgical complications, as has been previously reported in the literature looking at the validity of reporting capsule rupture data events [42]. However, while these issues may influence the true incidence in our study, we believe this SOSU study does provide accurate information as to the real-world current management of patients with persistent CMO post routine cataract surgery in Scotland.",
