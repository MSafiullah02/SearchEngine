Ciguatoxin, the causative agent for the disease, potentiates voltage-gated sodium channels, with resultant effects on neurons; there is also a suggestion that it has direct, calcium-mediated enterotoxin activity (Fasano et al., 1991) . While relevance to human cases is uncertain, there is one study of gene expression in mouse brains exposed to ciguatoxin in which there was enrichment of expression pathways related to complement and coagulation cascades (Ryan et al., 2010) . Given the clinical similarities between chronic ciguatera and chronic fatigue syndromes, it could be hypothesized that similar physiologic mechanisms were operational in the two syndromes.

Each dot represents a sample and the shade represents the type of the sample. some overlap with gene pathways identified in patients with chronic fatigue (e.g., ARF1 (Vernon et al., 2002) ; CEACAM family (Kaushik et al., 2005) ; however, more recent studies have raised questions about the relevance of these findings (Byrnes et al., 2009) . Ciguatera remains an important clinical entity in areas where there is high dependence on tropical reef fish for food. Identification of a biomarker for CFP (particularly recurrent or chronic CFP), and/or for CFP susceptibility, would have substantial clinical relevance, both in terms of diagnosis, and as a basis for development of therapeutic interventions. Findings of this preliminary study are intriguing: there is a need to follow-up on these results (with appropriate control populations) and to further explore potential physiologic relevance of the identified gene pathways.
