A membranous envelope is associated with a relatively low resistance to desiccation, heat, alcohols, or detergents, limiting survival of virus particles outside their host. However, carrying an envelope offers distinct advantages for a virus: (i) envelopment allows the virus to exit from its host cell using the cellular machinery for exocytosis, thus avoiding cell damage and preventing immune responses; (ii) the envelope increases the packaging capacity of a virus particle and allows for carrying additional viral proteins; (iii) the envelope hides structurally restricted capsid antigens from circulating antibodies; and (iv) envelope proteins on the surface of a virus have a higher structural flexibility than capsid proteins because they are not part of a rigid capsid structure; thus, enveloped viruses can escape neutralizing immune response better than their nonenveloped counterparts. Most zoonotic viruses are enveloped; apparently, variations of envelope proteins facilitate adaptation to different hosts, although of course additional adaptations are required.",

On the other hand, newly emerging viruses cannot be targeted by vaccines, and there are no vaccines approved yet to prevent infections with several important human pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), or Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV).

Using cellular targets helps to avoid rapid adaptation of viruses and development of drug resistance, and often allows targeting of emerging as well as known pathogens at the same time.

Another alternative is using immunomodulatory therapies that have proven to be very efficient in the control of viral infections.

HIV fusion inhibitors (e.g., T-20, enfuvirtide) and CCR5 inhibitors (e.g., maraviroc) are already in clinical use (Table 2). Synthetic compounds that simultaneously inhibit attachment and entry of HIV are interesting candidate antivirals: a molecule consisting of a CD4-mimetic peptide linked to a dodecasaccharide HSPG has been designed to simultaneously target two critical and highly conserved regions of gp120 from HIV-1. Linkage of two functional moieties provides strong cooperative effects, resulting in low-nanomolar antiviral activity towards both CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strains [6].",

Blocking their tyrosine kinase activity with clinically approved inhibitors broadly impairs infection by all major HCV genotypes and known viral escape variants [7]. Recently, a myristoylated peptide derived from the N-terminal part of the large surface protein of HBV, named Myrcludex-B, has been shown to bind to the sodium-taurocholate transporter peptide NTCP serving as HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) receptor. Myrcludex B efficiently prevents HBV and HDV infection [9], and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. An alternative option that does not require any knowledge about virus receptors is the use of peptides derived from the envelope protein of a virus for competitive inhibition of receptor binding. Such peptides have proven antiviral effects against dengue virus, HSV, and HIV-1 [8].",

Compounds inhibiting these cellular transport pathways without toxicity may thus be used as antivirals. HCV exploits and modifies the lipid metabolism of hepatocytes and enters hepatocytes by taking advantage of the cholesterol uptake pathway. This has been proven both in vitro and in vivo using ezetimibe, an FDA-approved selective inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption [14]. Circulating HCV virions are embedded in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and are therefore referred to as lipo-viro-particles. Inhibitors of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the enzyme catalyzing conversion of VLDL to LDL, prevent HCV infection in vitro as well as in primary human hepatocytes transplanted into uPA-SCID mice by retaining the viral particles at the cell surface 15, 16. On the same line, we recently found that ezetimibe efficiently blocks a very early step in the HBV life cycle [17], indicating that HBV infection also involves the lipid transport pathway.",
