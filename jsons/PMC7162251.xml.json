Green in this sense means that the article should have been produced and transported under the best environmental conditions, with minimal energy consumption and, if possible, be made from naturally available materials, preferably from local sources. Unfortunately, green issues have become inextricably confused with \u2018organic\u2019 sourcing and production, particularly where food, drink, personal care products, and even to a degree, medicinal preparations involving herbal or homeopathic treatments, are concerned. To many members of the general public \u2018chemicals\u2019, \u2018synthetics\u2019 or \u2018E\u2010numbers\u2019 are bad for us, the corollary being that anything \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018organic\u2019 must be beneficial. Indeed, many people seem to be unaware that some of the most toxic chemicals known (e.g. ricin and botulin) are not manufactured but are natural proteins. With the plethora of ecological and ethical phrases now in common use, caution is needed as to the precise meanings accorded to them [1]. In fact, because our preoccupation with environmental matters is relatively recent, many eco\u2010phrases have only come into common use since the millennium [2].",

To achieve this end, the cotton crop would firstly have had to be grown without the use of pesticides (at present this is by far their greatest agricultural single usage), although possibly some manual operations would involve child labour. Whilst the fabric produced might have been dyed using a natural dye (with a somewhat toxic mordant?), it would have been processed at minimal labour cost and have had to be transported many thousands of miles! Transport is indeed a problem with organic food in the UK for, at present, some 75% is imported giving it a bad \u2018carbon footprint\u2019 [3]. This is also true in the textile field owing to mass importation of ready\u2010made garments, mainly from the Indian subcontinent and China, but there is an increasing trend towards eco\u2010awareness in European, American and Australian textile production and fashion design [4]. The awareness of the textile production industry has differed from that of fashion designers, who can focus on the end product itself, whilst dye\u2010 and printworks have had to pay much more attention to environmental legislation regarding the safe use of dyes, auxiliary products and chemicals, and particularly the disposal of works effluent.",

Examples are the supermarket chains demonstrating their increased sensitivity to ecological pressures by offering customer rewards for using their own or reused plastic shopping bags (by Tesco) and the use of biodegradable bags and packaging (by the Co\u2010operative Group and Sainsbury\u2019s) [6]. Some investors are scrutinising CSR procedures, whilst socially responsible investment groups take things a stage further by not investing where they doubt a firm\u2019s ethical credentials.

Psychologically, in more recent times the hue green has been regarded as denoting something which is natural and safe which is why Health and Safety Regulations specify this colour for First Aid and emergency escape route signage [9] and gas cylinders with green\u2010painted shoulders hold only inert gases. Green is also regarded as being cool, calm, restful and natural [10] and has consequently been adopted as an ecological symbol [11]. Green is indeed the predominant colour of the natural, fertile world and is that of the chlorophyll pigments of foliage that reflect strongly in the green waveband around 550 nm, which is also that of the maximum wavelength for solar radiation flux at sea level. In nature, the chlorophyll pigments are the basis for most photosynthetic processes which have rendered life possible on earth [12] and, although we are now all familiar with the \u2018blue planet\u2019, the predominant colour of the earth from space, at certain periods of excessive growth of marine plankton it turns a patchy green.",

            "text": "In the ancient world, man had to rely on two natural, copper\u2010based, mineral pigments that were green, namely malachite and verdigris [13], and these were of relatively low toxicity. Such was not the case for some of those that were subsequently produced synthetically. In 1775, whilst investigating arsenic, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele produced a new pigment, copper hydrogen arsenate, which he recognised was very toxic. At that time, artists needed a tinctorially stronger green pigment and this product was manufactured as Scheele\u2019s Green. Although a similar but somewhat faster pigment, Emerald or Schweinfurt Green (copper aceto\u2010arsenite) was eventually introduced in 1814, the former pigment remained popular for many years. It is quite probable that the somewhat mysterious death of Napoleon whilst in exile on Elba may have been accelerated (he had stomach cancer) because Scheele\u2019s Green had been used to print the wallpaper in his apartment. Under damp conditions mould could grow on the animal glues then used as adhesives, and this can decompose the pigment to produce a mixture of toxic arsine and di\u2010 and trimethylarsine gases, which give rise to a complaint subsequently known as Gosio\u2019s disease. Following a radio programme in 1980, the public were asked whether anyone had a reliable reference to the colour of the ex\u2010emperor\u2019s wallpaper. Amazingly, someone not only knew it was green but produced a nineteenth century scrapbook they had inherited, with an entry dated 1823 (2 years after Napoleon\u2019s death) containing a sample of the actual paper cut from the wall of his room by a visitor. When analysed, this was shown to contain arsenic, as did several keepsake samples of Bonaparte\u2019s hair. In the late eighteenth century, the production of zinc oxide and availability of the mineral smalt had led to the development of cobalt green (CoO\u00b7ZnO), a pigment with superior stability to the former greens, but, although relatively bright, its tinctorial strength was poor and the cheaper copper/arsenic pigments continued in use.",

This was to be followed in 1863 by Aldehyde Green from the firm of Meister, Lucius, Bruning (later to become Hoechst). The 1860s also saw the birth of triphenylmethane (TPM) basic dyes such as fuchsine (magenta), followed in the 1870s by Methyl Green, which was soon to be replaced by Malachite Green (Basic Green 4) that is still widely used as a bactericide in aquaria despite doubts about its toxicity.",

            "text": "The dyestuff industry in the early twentieth century was dominated by German manufacturers but systematic research in Scotland by the firm of Morton Sundour alongside Scottish Dyes in 1920 produced a vat dye having outstanding fastness properties, namely Caledon Jade Green X (Vat Green 1) [16]. Scottish Dyes became part of the newly formed ICI in 1926 and it was at Grangemouth Works that the fast blue pigment, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) was developed following investigation of a chance observation of dark insoluble deposits being formed in chipped, enamel\u2010covered, iron trays which had contained molten phthalic anhydride. This led in the 1930s to the equally fast corresponding green pigments based on polychlorinated CuPc, the Monastral Greens. Innovation in ICI resumed after World War II, for in 1950 the soluble CuPc Alcian dyes were introduced and yielded very fast bright blue and green shades on cellulosic fibres. These were temporarily solubilised, \u2018ingrain\u2019 dyes which were converted to a pigment by after\u2010treatment with alkali. These dyes became obsolete after the introduction of fibre\u2010reactive dyes (again by ICI) in 1956 and of the first reactive monochlorotriazine turquoise blue dye, Procion Brilliant Blue H7G, which enabled the production of emerald green shades using mixtures with bright pyrazolone yellows. Today, there are a score of homogeneous reactive greens of several chemical types which have been introduced.",

            "text": "Over the last 150 years, chemists and dye technologists have contributed enormously to our colourful world and many of them were themselves colourful people. To take but three of the above examples, much depended upon scientists with enquiring minds turning an apparent failure into a success. William Perkin, trying to synthesise quinine at a time when structural organic chemistry was in its infancy, produced a black tar. Many would have discarded this and tried something else but, seeing the beautiful colour of an alcoholic extract and finding this dyed silk and cotton he, supported by his family, eventually became a very successful dye manufacturer [17]. Again, when problems occurred at the Grangemouth works in the production of phthalimide (used in the manufacture of indigo and produced by the action of ammonia on molten phthalic anhydride) it was observed that black occlusions were produced only in chipped enamel trays. The simple solution was to throw any damaged trays away but again the plant chemist, A. G. Dandridge, decided to investigate further and, although early experiments produced only dull colours, eventually a new bright blue pigment, copper phthalocyanine, was born whose chemical structure was eventually confirmed using X\u2010ray diffraction images [18]. Then, 100 years after Perkin\u2019s discovery, reactive dyes for cellulosic fibres were first marketed. The original work on reactive dyes at ICI\u2019s technical service laboratories in Blackley were for dyeing wool; amongst the more promising experimental dyes tested were the dichlorotriazines but these still did not fix very well. To attain better fixation, a strong alkali appeared to be required, which was of course impractical because it would have severely degraded the fibre. Not deterred, the dye technologist involved, Ian (later Professor) Rattee, in present day parlance \u2018thought outside the box\u2019 and decided that such conditions would, however, be quite acceptable for dyeing cotton and, in co\u2010operation with Dr W. E. Stevens, the first three Procion dyes were born [19]. Initially, the \u2018Saltfix\u2019 application method involved padding the dyes and then passing the fabric through saturated brine containing caustic soda. In time it was found possible to apply these dyes under much milder conditions and, as they say, the rest is history.",

Two important classification systems are those in Europe, covered by the European Directive of 1994/1995 (94/36/EC, 95/45/EC), together with their subsequent amendments of 1999, 2001 and 2006 which clarified definitions and limitations of use, and those in the USA represented by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Federal regulations [20]. In Europe, food additives and colorants are classified by \u2018E\u2010numbers\u2019 with their Colour Index (CI number) reference. This list includes both synthetic dyes and natural colorants, for example, lycopene and \u03b2\u2010carotene, mostly obtained from natural sources, but chemically identical products may sometimes be made synthetically or biosynthetically, which may allow slight structural modifications [21]. In both the European and the American regulatory systems, the use of some colours is restricted to certain specific outlets such as animal feeds. In the USA, the 30 natural colours listed are, however, classed as exempt from certification. Synthetic colours are usually referred to as \u2018artificial\u2019 (or as \u2018E\u2010numbers\u2019) by the general public in the UK and recent years have seen much publicity about certain products, such as tartrazine (E102, CI Food Yellow 4) used in confectionary and orange\u2010flavoured drinks and thought to lead to hyperactivity in some children. USA Federal regulations on food labelling require that colour products from natural sources, although exempt from certification, must be described as \u2018artificial\u2019 or \u2018added\u2019 colours as the authority maintains that \u2018natural\u2019 colour can only be that originally present in the particular foodstuff. Details of all well\u2010established sources and properties of natural food colours can be found in Hendry and Houghton\u2019s \u2018Natural food colorants\u2019 [22]. The EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) is at present reviewing data on the presently permitted dyes and will eventually review the legislation, but this process is only at a very early stage.",

E\u2010number products total over 300, only 42 of which are colours. Packaged foods now also display labels with a \u2018traffic light\u2019 system to indicate the levels of salt, sugar and fats based on a \u2018guideline daily amount\u2019 for adults. The recent display on some packaged snack foods of the \u2018carbon footprint\u2019 of its contents in grams of carbon dioxide is, however, somewhat meaningless to the purchaser. In Europe, the market for organic foods is estimated at \u20ac15 bn and growing at around 10% per annum [23], whilst in 2006/2007 the UK showed an even higher rate of increase of about 30% [24]. To be certified as organic, products must be grown or manufactured in a manner that adheres to standards set by authorities in individual countries and in the UK these are the Organic Farmers and Growers [25] and the Soil Association [26]. Although scientific evidence for the direct benefits to the consumer of organic food are still in dispute [27, 28] there are benefits in reduced ecological damage and the overall consumption of energy, if one neglects subsequent transport costs [29]. Many other aspects of the production, nutrition role and safety of organic foods have been recently reviewed [30]. It does seem likely that more food will have to be grown without the use of pesticides because new European Union (EU) legislation looks likely to ban perhaps 90% of them [31]. This in turn may increase the need to accept pest\u2010resistant genetically modified (GM) foods.",

            "text": "Heightened customer awareness to environmental issues has led to strong public resistance to the introduction of GM crops or the sterilisation of food using ionising radiation. There is a particular expectation that if it is required to add any colour to organic food it should be a natural product. Those derived from fruit and vegetables such as the betalains (from beetroot) and lycopene (from tomatoes) may thus seem particularly attractive, but only if the customer recognises their origin. There are few problems using natural colours where yellow or orange shades are required but most approved reds and blues are synthetic. The recent rapid expansion of the organic food market has therefore led to a renewed interest in natural colours, developed in modified forms if necessary (Table 1). Some analysts predict a 10\u201315% per annum growth for natural colours, which is 10 times that for synthetics. Some natural food colours such as the carotenes are surprisingly stable to extremes of pH and temperature, but others are inferior to synthetics in such respects, a specific example being that concerning the colouring of tinned peas. Without the use of added colour, the thermal processing of tinned marrowfat and mushy peas would leave the contents with an unappetising olive brown colour and the desirable bright green shade has traditionally been attained using a mixture of Green S (E142) and tartrazine (E102). The change of shade during heat treatment of green vegetables is because of the instability to acid of their own natural chlorophyll, which tends to lose its coordinated magnesium and form pheophytin. In fact, it is because of the potential instability of natural chlorophyll (E140) that it is also sold as its copper complex (E141). Similarly garden peas and spinach can be treated so as to preserve more of their fresh chlorophyll green colour during the canning process by the introduction of zinc or copper ions [32], but in a recent exercise by the Co\u2010operative Group supermarkets to replace all synthetic food colours with natural ones, it was found impossible to find a sufficiently stable natural colour to replace Green S. This retailer has in fact decided to withdraw some 27 product lines which cannot be reformulated satisfactorily using natural colours [33]. Most of the major UK food retailers have since followed this lead and reformulated the colours used in their \u2018own brand\u2019 ranges of food products, some retailers even claiming that their foods will be \u2018free of E\u2010numbers by 2008\u2019, a statement which further fosters the public misconception that only synthetic dyes carry this designation.",

A third type of formulation which is required for the specialised printing of food wrappings is pigment dispersions. Here, it is clearly a requirement that these do not transfer to the food product itself. Few EU\u2010approved pigments are listed but include three iron oxides (all listed under E172), calcium carbonate (Pigment White 18), titanium dioxide (Pigment White 6) and Lithol Rubine BK (Pigment Red 57.1); the last named can, however, only be used for colouring cheese rind. It has been argued that if the print on packaging is never in contact with the food and the wrapping is itself impermeable then no contact colour transfer can occur [34]. The situation in this field is at present unclear because printing inks are not specifically covered by EU legislation other than the general food safety Framework Regulation (EC Regulation No. 1935/2004) and three Directives (80/590/EC, 89/109/EC, 89/109/EC). Other draft Directives have long been under discussion but there is still no imminent legislation.

A novel type of label which changes colour according to a time/temperature function has been proposed [36]. This consists of a colourless layer containing Crystal Violet lactone (see Scheme 1) and a second layer containing an acid donor which is attached only when the food is first packaged. The acid, which is slowly released thereafter, at a temperature\u2010dependent rate, causes an increasing degree of violet colour change until it becomes noticeable.",

The problem is that toys which might be handled by very young children may also be sucked, leading to ingestion of potentially toxic metals and hence the very low permitted levels [38, 39]. This had to be borne in mind in the rather unusual case of producing for the first time, truly coloured bubbles using dyes which neither stained the skin nor clothing but which were also acceptable environmentally. To achieve this it is not only necessary to select a colorant that associates with the micelles of the chosen surface active agent on the bubble\u2019s surface but can also be prevented from staining by including suitable dye blocking agents in the formulation. Finally, when the bubbles burst they were to become colourless. This aim was finally achieved by using TPM dyes having a labile leuco form; for example, Crystal Violet lactone (normally used in carbonless copying papers), which only becomes coloured when the lactone ring opens to yield the carboxy form (Scheme 1) [40]. For creating the world\u2019s first truly coloured bubbles, the inventor, Ram Sabnis, was presented with a Grand Innovation Award in 2005 [41].",

Today, green chemistry is a subject in itself and particularly good progress is being made using novel, selective homogeneous, heterogeneous or bio\u2010catalysts, which give high product yields under very mild reaction conditions [83, 84]. General examples appropriate to dye manufacture are those involving sulphonation, nitration, halogenation or diazotisation, in which the formation of large amounts of inorganic salts is prevented by replacing the conventional stoichimetric quantities of mineral acids and alkalis. By using recyclable solid acids and bases, which are preferably present in only catalytic amounts, yields approaching 100% can be achieved. Biocatalysis is illustrated by the Mitsubishi process, using the nitrile hydratase enzyme, for the production of acrylamide from acrylonitrile, a process which proceeds at 5 \u00b0C without the need for a polymerisation inhibitor [85]. In the case of an improved biosynthetic, enzymic production method for indigo, technology seems to have gone full circle [86]. Another example concerns intermediates for fibre manufacture.

Exhaust carbon dioxide has also been used in greenhouse cultivation of crops such as tomatoes which can be grown hydroponically in \u2018polytunnels\u2019, the plastic sheeting for which may be coloured with a green pigment which transmits the two photosynthetically active wavebands around 450 and 650 nm [106].",

            "text": "For identification and tax enforcement purposes, fuels are often coloured; for example, in the UK and Spain agricultural diesel is red but green in Norway and in Ireland. During, and for a time after World War II, when fuel was rationed, commercial vehicles used red petrol and this was coloured with Solvent Red 19 or 24, which were relatively easy to remove, but the fuel was further tagged with a colourless additive, dimethylamine. This could be detected even in the engine exhaust fumes using test papers impregnated with aniline acetate which gave a red colour reaction. Nowadays, red diesel, which has a considerably lower taxation level, is a slightly different distillation fraction containing more sulphur than fuel used in vehicles. In the UK it is illegal to use red diesel for other than agricultural vehicles and machinery, commercial maritime vessels and, until October 2008, privately owned pleasure craft. It is equally illegal to use heating oil as a diesel fuel. In the UK, colourless markers are therefore still in use; for example, quinizarin is added to red diesel and coumarin to heating oil at such a concentration as to be unnoticeable until a fuel sample is shaken with a small volume of aqueous alkali. An equally simple test, in this case shaking with an acid solution, produces a colour reaction when Crystal Violet lactone is used at low concentrations as a fuel marker. A further approach is to use compounds which can be detected spectrophotometrically by characteristic fluorescence or infrared absorption peaks, but this has the disadvantage of not being applicable for on\u2010the\u2010spot testing. At present in the UK, despite these controls to enforce collection of the appropriate tax, private individuals are surprisingly free to set up a small plant to produce biodiesel from waste vegetable oil which, as long as it is used personally, attracts no taxation from HM Customs and Excise.",

            "text": "For some purposes it is necessary to colour not the fuel but the exhaust gases when a fuel is burned. The fuel may be initially fluid or solid, depending on the application, but similar solvent soluble dyes are used in both cases. To heighten the effect of acrobatic or fly\u2010past displays it has long been the practice to colour the exhaust gasses from jet engines. Aircraft smokes are produced by dissolving a suitable dye, such as Quinizarine Green SS (Solvent Green 3), in a mixture of perchlorethylene and diesel fuel and injecting this into the exhaust of the aircraft\u2019s jet engine. Similar dyes are used to colour smoke flares and military smoke grenades, the use of which raise more safety issues than aircraft smokes. Safety distress flares for maritime emergency use are usually red and contain a solid pyrotechnic mixture with the addition of Solvent Red 1 or Disperse Red 9. Military smokes are produced in a variety of forms, but consist of a solid fuel which used to be based on sodium chlorate and sulphur, with sodium bicarbonate added to reduce the burning temperature. More recently these compositions have been modified by replacing sulphur with sugar and sodium bicarbonate with the more effective magnesium bicarbonate. The selection of the dyes (e.g. benzanthrone) used in smoke grenades has also been modified following toxicity testing on animals, although no serious side\u2010effects of the smokes have been reported for human inhalation, the main concern being mainly the possibility of allergic dermatitis [107].",

These demands arise not only from consumers but from many national and international organisations whose aim is to raise public awareness of such issues, particularly where food is concerned, but they also consider more general factors such as climate change, the ecology, energy consumption, recycling, employment ethics etc. Every apparent improvement carries a downside. Ethical employment standards ban the use of child labour yet in some countries the alternative for the children themselves may be starvation. Buying a \u2018Fair Trade\u2019 item may make us feel good but, like organically produced food, is more expensive and it is clear that there is a section of the public that simply wishes to buy the cheapest food. Nevertheless although eggs produced from battery\u2010reared hens are undoubtedly the cheapest (but the least \u2018natural\u2019 as far as the chickens are concerned) some UK supermarkets are now to sell only barn or free range eggs.",
