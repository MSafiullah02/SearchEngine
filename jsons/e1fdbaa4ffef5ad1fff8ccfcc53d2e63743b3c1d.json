We selected 98 NPA and 37 stool samples collected at different times after the onset of disease and tested them in a real-time quantitative RT-PCR specific for the open reading frame (ORF) 1b region of SARS CoV. Detection rates for the conventional and real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were compared. To investigate the nature of viral RNA molecules in these clinical samples, we determined copy numbers of ORF 1b and nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences of SARS CoV. Results: The quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS CoV in samples collected early in the course of the disease. Real-time assays targeted at the ORF 1b region and the N gene revealed that copy numbers of ORF 1b and N gene sequences in clinical samples were similar.

Our results showed that real-time assays for SARS CoV were particularly useful for early SARS diagnosis. Results from this study also indicated that SARS CoV RNA molecules in NPA and stool samples might be of genomic RNA origin. These results take us closer to the goal of prompt identification of SARS CoV in clinical specimens early in the disease, thereby leading to better control and clinical management of this disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [], "year": 2003, "venue": "Wkly Epidemiol Rec", "volume": "78", "issn": "", "pages": "73--77", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Communicable disease surveillance & response (CSR)", "authors": [], "year": 2003, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "Jsm", "middle": [], "last": "Peiris", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Lai", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Llm", "middle": [], "last": "Poon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Guan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Lyc", "middle": [], "last": "Yam", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Lim", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Lancet", "volume": "361", "issn": "", "pages": "1319--1344", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Ksiazek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Erdman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Goldsmith", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Zaki", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Peret", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Emery", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "348", "issn": "", "pages": "1953--66", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Drosten", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Gunther", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Preiser", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Van Der Werf", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Brodt", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Becker", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "348", "issn": "", "pages": "1967--76", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study", "authors": [{"first": "Jsm", "middle": [], "last": "Peiris", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Chu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Vcc", "middle": [], "last": "Cheng", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Chan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Hung", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Llm", "middle": [], "last": "Poon", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Lancet", "volume": "361", "issn": "", "pages": "1767--72", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Koch's postulates fulfilled for SARS virus", "authors": [{"first": "G", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Doornum", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Van Den Hoogen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "423", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Rapid diagnosis of a coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)", "authors": [{"first": "Llm", "middle": [], "last": "Poon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "O", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Wong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Luk", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Yuen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Peiris", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Guan", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Clin Chem", "volume": "49", "issn": "", "pages": "953--958", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF9": {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "Transmission dynamics of the etiological agent of SARS in Hong Kong: impact of public health interventions", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Riley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Fraser", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Donnelly", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Ghani", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Abu-Raddad", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Hedley", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Science", "volume": "300", "issn": "", "pages": "1961--1967", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF10": {"ref_id": "b10", "title": "Communicable disease surveillance & response (CSR).
