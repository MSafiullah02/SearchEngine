To this end, a case-by-case risk assessment is conducted which consists in the identification and characterisation of potential effects, which may be intended or unintended, together with an assessment of the likelihood and consequences should any effect occur. Depending on the risks identified, risk management measures can be proposed.",

For example in Europe, tissue culture work will in many cases involve the use of genetically modified cell lines as well, in which case a risk assessment should be made in accordance with the provisions of the Directive 2009/41/EC related to the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (European Commission 2009). Cell culturing activities aiming at manufacturing biopharmaceuticals are covered by the Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and its amending acts laying down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use (European Commission 2004a), whereas activities that involve the use of human cells and tissues for application to the human body falls within the scope of the Directive 2004/23/EC and its amending acts (European Commission 2004b). The manipulation of animal cell cultures also exposes the worker to potential biological risks which are considered under the provision of the European Directive 2000/54/EC (European Commission 2000). It should be pointed out that guidelines aiming at mitigating the biological risks for the laboratory workers, public health and the environment have been issued by some scientific advisory bodies or competent authorities (World Health Organization 2004; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009a; Swiss Expert Committee for Biosafety 2011).",

In addition, information related to the physicochemical properties of the pathogenic organism is considered such as: (1) susceptibility to disinfectants, (2) physical inactivation and (3) drug susceptibility (e.g. sensitivity and known resistance to antibiotics or antiviral compounds). Finally, aspects related to the disease caused by the pathogen are also to be taken into consideration. This includes (1) the availability of an effective prophylaxis, (2) the availability of an efficient therapy and (3) any reported case of laboratory-acquired infection(s) (LAIs).",

The incidence to harbour organisms that could cause harm to human health is therefore considered higher in human or primate cells compared to cells of non-human origin (Brown 1997). Accordingly, mammalian cells other than human or primate cells are considered to represent less risk, followed by avian and invertebrate cells. However, it should be kept in mind that some infectious agents are able to cross the species barrier and to persist in new host species, leading to zoonotic diseases. It is acknowledged since many years that more or less 70 % of the emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic (Chomel et al. 2007). Well documented cases of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans include hantavirus (murine reservoir), haemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Marburg) (Peters et al. 1992), avian Influenza virus (Reperant et al. 2012) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (Ksiazek et al. 2003; Herman et al. 2004). These examples show that incidences of cross-species transfer can occur and that occupational risks related to exposure to infected animal tissues or cell cultures should not be underestimated (Mahy and Brown 2000; Louz et al. 2005).",

For example, intestinal and certain leukocytes have a half-life of a few days, human erythrocytes have approximately a 55\u201360-day half-life, healthy liver cells have a life span of several months, whereas, in adults, there is a slow loss of brain cells with little replacement. Partly due to this fact, some cell lines can be more readily obtained than others. The establishment of cell lines is often obtained by a series of (generally uncontrolled) mutations that occur by culturing cells for a longer period. It is known that cells cultured for extensive periods of time display changing growth properties. A reduction of the doubling time, as a result of transformation, may give cells the ability to overgrow the rest of the population and to survive for a large (infinite) number of passages compared to primary cells with a finite life span. Therefore, the establishment of cell cultures of a certain cell type upon extensive passage relies on the positive selection for cells that have a growth advantage. These transformed cells can have an increased tumorigenic potential and may present more risks of becoming/being fully neoplastic upon accidental (Gugel and Sanders 1986) or deliberate introduction into the human body. Therefore, taking the tumorigenic potential into account, the following cell types may be ranked in increasing order of risk: epithelial and fibroblast cells, gut mucosa, endothelium, neural tissues, haematogenous (e.g. blood, lymphoid) cells and tissue.",

Hence the study of a pathogens\u2019 lifecycle or immunity escape mechanism requires the intentional in vitro infection of animal (or human) cells. The identification of potential hazards associated with infected cell cultures requires a consideration of the intrinsic cell properties and the inherent properties of the infecting pathogen. The latter implies an assessment of a number of pathogen specific criteria along with aspects such as the existence of effective treatment or prophylaxis. On the basis of these criteria the WHO defines a classification system that enables the categorisation of micro-organisms into four risk groups (World Health Organization 2004). A fundamental rule is that the biological risk of infected cell cultures will depend on the infecting pathogen(s) class of risk. For example, cell cultures deliberately infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in order to produce virus particles are assigned to class of risk 3, as HCV is a class of risk 3 virus. Human cells infected with an airborne pathogen like species of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex are also assigned to class of risk 3 and are requiring the adoption of Biosafety Level 3 containment. However, as discussed below, the class of risk to which the infected cell cultures are assigned will not necessarily indicate the level of containment to be implemented as the latter will also be determined by the nature of the work carried out with these cells. An example is the infection of bovine leukocytes with Theileria parva, a tick-transmitted, intracellular protozoan of veterinary importance and the causative agent of East Coast fever among domestic livestock. It is an animal pathogen of risk group 3, which is not pathogenic to humans. The sporozoite form (infective form) invades bovine lymphocytes where it develops into a non-infective form (shizonts) and induces host cell transformation and clonal expansion of the cell. These infected bovine leucocytes may be categorised under class of risk 2 for animals, while the biosafety level (BSL1 or 2) appropriate for handling is determined by the presence or absence of the infectious form of the parasites.",

Although alternatives methods such as high throughput DNA sequencing are available to identify a micro-organism without a prior in vitro expansion, cell culture followed by electron microscopy remains the complementary approach of choice to molecular methods for the unbiased diagnosis of ill-defined infectious disease. Some of the diagnostic activities presented by the authors required the adoption of BSL3 measures to handle the cell cultures.

Typically, these organisms cause increased turbidity, pH shift of media (change in media colour), slower growth of the cells and cell destruction. Antibiotics may be used to prevent cell bacterial contamination, however, continuous use of antibiotics in cultures may lead to development of resistant organisms with slow growing properties, which are much more difficult to detect by direct visual observation. Compared to bacterial or fungal infections, mycoplasma contamination gives more problems in terms of incidence, detectability, prevention and eradication. Mycoplasma, an intracellular bacterium, is one of the most common cell culture contaminants. It may go unnoticed for many passages and can change several cell properties such as growth, metabolism, morphology and genome structure (Paddenberg et al. 1996; McGarrity and Kotani 1985). It has also been reported to influence the yield of virus production in infected cells (Hargreaves and Leach 1970). Mycoplasmal contamination is also a biosafety concern, because some of the contaminating Mycoplasma spp. belong to risk group 2. Together with M. arginini, M. orale, M. pirum and M. fermentans, pathogenic organisms like M. gallisepticum (risk group 3 for animals), M. hyorhinis (risk group 2 for animals), M. pneumoniae and M. hominis (risk group 2 for humans) account for more than 96 % of mycoplasma contaminants in cell cultures. Primary sources of contamination with M. orale, M. fermentans, and M. hominis in the laboratory are infected people who handle cell cultures and suspensions of viruses. Sources of M. argini and M. hyorhinis are usually animal donors of tissues and biological constituents used for cell culture, e.g. calf serum and trypsin (Razin and Tully 1995; Pinheiro de Oliveira et al. 2013). It was already reported that the contamination of cell cultures by Mycoplasma occurs via aerosols (O\u2019Connell et al. 1964).",

            "text": "Viral contamination merits particular attention because infected cells may pose a serious harm to human health, especially when infected cells are able to release infectious particles. Human cells may be infected by various viruses like hepatitis viruses, retroviruses, herpes viruses or papillomaviruses. Although cell cultures from non-human origin may pose less risk, it should be emphasised that many viruses have a broad host range and can cross species barriers. Since a number of non-human viruses are capable of infecting and/or replicating in human cells in vitro, their possibility to infect human cells in vivo if human exposure occurs should be carefully considered. Well-known viral contaminants of primate tissues or cells from non-human origin that can cause human disease are listed in Table 22.1. While contamination with some viruses may be associated with changes in cell morphology or behaviour \u2013 such as the formation of syncytia (HIV, herpes viruses), swelling of cells (adenoviruses) or haemagglutination or haemadsorption \u2013 viral contamination may be harder to detect when cytopathic effects remain absent. Viral contamination could also trigger adverse effects as a result of recombination events or phenotypic mixing between contaminating components and experimentally introduced agents, creating agents with new properties. For example, experimental results suggested that HTLV-I or HTLV-II undergo phenotypic mixing with HIV-1 in HTLV/HIV-1 co-infected cells, leading to an increase of the pathogenicity of HIV-1 by broadening the spectrum of its cellular tropism to CD4 negative cells (Lusso et al. 1990). Another example is the contamination of murine cell cultures by Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). LCMV is an arenavirus that establishes a silent, chronic infection in mice but causes aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis to humans. The significance of LCMV contamination has been reinforced by the description of cases of laboratory-acquired LCMV infections arising from contaminated murine tumour cell lines (Mahy et al. 1991). Manipulation of LCMV infected material or material with an increased likelihood of LCMV contamination necessitates the implementation of a BSL2. However, it should be kept in mind that the handling of the neurotropic LCMV itself should be performed in a BSL 3 laboratory.\n",

But even with cells developing the non-infectious form of parasites, possible harmful effects remain to be considered since natural modes of transmission could be bypassed during the manipulation of infected cells.

Contrary to the majority of the infectious agents, TSE agents are resistant to most of the physical and chemical methods commonly used for decontamination of infectious agents. It has been shown that neuroblastoma cell lines, primary cultured neurons and astrocytes can serve as hosts (Butler et al. 1988). Although many studies have suggested that the risk of propagation of TSE agents in tissue culture cells cultivated in the presence of bovine serum potentially contaminated with TSE was restricted to neurons or brain-derived cell cultures, it has been shown recently that non-neuronal cells can also support TSE infection, suggesting that any cell line expressing normal host prion protein could have the potential to support propagation of TSE agents (Vilette et al. 2001; Vorberg et al. 2004). While the understanding of the transmission of prions is still in progress (natural transmission seems mainly to take place via oral route in human and animals), investigators using cell cultures need to take into account different routes by which these agents may be transmitted experimentally. Mouse scrapie aerosol transmission has been successfully obtained in mice (Stitz and Aguzzi 2011; Haybaeck et al. 2011). In cervids, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) was already proposed as a natural airborne pathogen (Denkers et al. 2010).

Infected organisms or infected animal cells or tissues from which a cell line has been established are the primary source of contamination. An accidental contamination can also occur through the material used for cell culturing including glassware, storage bottles and pipettes due to incorrect maintenance or sterilisation. Before the use of disposable material the lip of the culture flask and the outside of the used pipette were important sources of contamination with mycoplasma (McGarrity 1976). Nowadays, the use of disposable and sterile pipettes has significantly decreased the likelihood of adventitious contamination. A third source of contamination resides in culture media and its components such as serum, basic culture media and salt solutions and enzymes (trypsin, pronase and collagenase). For example, media and additives derived from bovine sources are often contaminated with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) (Levings and Wessman 1991). As mentioned above the relative resistance of TSE agents may also be an issue when using bovine-derived products as tissue culture supplements. Finally, non-filtered air supply, clothing, personnel and floor can be a source of airborne contamination (Hay 1991).",

            "text": "Genetically modified (GM) animal cell cultures are employed for a number of different activities. For example, the expression of transgenes and production of proteins of interest whose function depends on methylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, lipid addition, or glycosylation may necessitate the capacity of higher eukaryotic cells to perform post-translational modifications. GM animal cell cultures may also be chosen for the replication of defective recombinant or even wild type viruses. The risk assessment of GM cells should follow the five-step methodology as outlined in Fig. 22.1, which means that an evaluation of each individual aspect in the process of genetic modification should be performed. This includes an evaluation of the recipient cell, the vector, the donor organism properties and an assessment of the characteristics of the inserted genetic material. A comprehensive risk assessment of genetically modified cells expressing transgenes should also take into account the risk associated with the transgene products. A gene product may be intrinsically harmful (e.g. toxic properties) or could induce hazardous properties via its expression in GM cells, dependent upon the genome integration site, promoter activity and expression of regulatory sequences governing expression. The risk assessment for transgenes is not straightforward and demands appropriate consideration. Comprehensive reviews have specifically addressed this topic (Bergmans et al. 2008; van den Akker et al. 2013). Genetic modification may confer an expanded life-span, immortalisation or increased capacity for tumour induction. However, it is unlikely that recombinant properties obtained by genetic modification may have an adverse effect upon release of the recombinant animal or human cells into the environment. Cells (genetically modified or not) have difficulties to survive in a hostile environment where control of temperature and osmolality is lacking or where cell-specific nutrients (e.g. glucose, vitamins, lipids) are not balanced or missing. Hence, the survival of such primary cells or cell lines outside of proper conditions is unlikely to occur. Apart from the fact that GM cell cultures may harbour pathogens and pose serious biological risks to human health (as discussed above), recombinant cells are more likely to cause harm when entering the body of animals or humans. However, the extent of the harmful effect remains hard to predict. It should be kept in mind that the lack of histocompatibility between recombinant cells and the host organism remains a major obstacle for these cells to survive and to multiply as the natural immune response of the healthy (immunocompetent) host will recognise foreign cells and eventually destroy them. This is also one of the main reasons why the culturing of cells originating from the laboratory worker is not allowed for research and diagnostic activities (risk associated with autologous cells).",

These are established cell lines that are deliberately and stably transfected with \u201chelper constructs\u201d to ensure the replication and packaging of replication deficient viral vectors. For example, in case of retroviral packaging cell lines, the expression of \u201chelper genes\u201d allows high-level constitutive production of viral proteins (e.g. gag, pol and env proteins), which are missing in the genome of the replication deficient viral vector but are crucial for viral replication. One of the main biosafety issues related to the use of packaging cell lines is the fact that replication-competent viruses may be generated as a result of (homologous) recombination between the replication deficient viral vector and viral sequences present in the packaging cell. These events could result in the formation of viruses with novel yet unwanted properties such as the generation of replication-competent viruses. One of the strategies to engineer safer generations of packaging cell lines consists in minimising the likelihood of generating replication-competent viruses by separating viral functional elements into different expression plasmids, thereby increasing the number of recombination events necessary to generate replication-competent viruses (Dull et al. 1998) or by reducing or eliminating the sequence homology between the viral vector and the helper sequences. However, endogenous retrovirus genomes expressed in safer generations of retroviral packaging cell lines may still give rise to unwanted recombination events (Chong et al. 1998). This means that the possibility to generate replication-competent viruses cannot be ruled out.",

This necessitates an evaluation of the type of manipulation, because processes, methods and/or equipment involved may increase or decrease the likelihood of exposure and hence the resulting potential risks. For instance, while established cell lines inherently present low risks, large scale operations involving the culturing of large volumes (from 10 to 1,000 l) are prone to contamination when inadequate containment measures are applied. This is exemplified by continuous processes such as cell cultivation in bioreactors where an appropriate design of seals, valves, pumps and transfer lines is required to guarantee long-term sterility of the operation to avoid inadvertent contamination. At the opposite, the handling of cell cultures belonging to risk group 2 may present less risk once they have been fixed by glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde/acetone for immunostaining and may therefore require less stringent containment measures",

The use of a fixative is in many cases not appropriate (e.g. viable cell sorting for subsequent further cell culturing) and the risk of aerosol formation can be particularly high, especially during sorting experiments and upon instrument failure such as a clogged sort nozzle. All scientists in the field of flow cytometry must be aware of the potential hazards associated with their discipline and only experienced and well-trained operators should perform potentially biohazardous cell sorting. General recommendations approved by the International Society of Analytical Cytology should help to set a basis for biosafety guidelines in flow cytometry laboratories (Schmid 2012). Some standard operating procedures and methods have also been described for ensuring the cell sorting under optimal biosafety conditions even under BSL3 conditions (Lennartz et al. 2005; Perfetto et al. 2011).Altering culture conditions: changing the availability of cell-specific nutrients, growth factors, signal molecules or adopting co-culture techniques may have significant effects on animal cell cultures as it may result in altered neoplasia (Stoker et al. 1990), altered expression of (proto)onco-genes or cell surface glycoproteins and release of endogenous viruses (Cunningham et al. 2004). As a consequence, changing culture conditions may lead to altered susceptibility of cultured cells to biologic agents such as viruses (Anders et al. 2003; Vincent et al. 2004).Manipulations involving use of needles or sharps: due to injuries cell material may be accidentally transferred directly to an operator\u2019s tissue and/or blood stream.\nIn vivo experiments involving animals: major risks are self-inoculation (needle-stick injury) and exposure to aerosols.\n",

BSL1 measures may be considered provided that all manipulations occur in a class II BSC and the cell culture is a well-characterised and certified cell line that presents no increased risk resulting from genetic modification or contaminating pathogen. The contained use in a BSL1 of viral infected cells could be envisaged if no viral particles are detectable in the supernatant of the infected cells. However, it should be emphasized that procedures for viral clearance are virus-host specific and that variables such as vector titre and the infection protocol can influence the degree and rate of clearance (Bagutti et al. 2012). Since the implementation of good laboratory practices and the use of a BSC is usually the norm in most laboratories dealing with cell culturing, we think that BSL1 laboratories can relatively easily be upgraded to BSL2 facilities by implementing a restricted number of simple additional safety measures. It is important to notice that horizontal laminar air flows and clean benches minimise the risk of adventitious contamination of the cell cultures, however they offer no protection for the manipulator or the environment. Bearing in mind that biosafety measures intend to provide a maximal protection of human health and the environment, it is important to note that the sole use of a horizontal laminar \u201cclean bench\u201d should be prohibited.",

            "text": "Biosafety is an internationally recognized concept referring to the maximal protection of laboratory workers, public health and the environment from the possible adverse effects associated to the use of organisms and micro-organisms (genetically modified or not). Within this respect activities involving the use of animal cell cultures for fundamental research, R&D or in vitro diagnosis purposes pose biosafety considerations as well. Before starting any of such activities biosafety considerations should be addressed by performing a biological risk assessment allowing the identification and characterisation of any potential adverse effect together with an evaluation of the likelihood and consequences should any effect happen. Such an approach is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the type of manipulation and the type of cell culture handled. A risk assessment will result in biosafety recommendations in view of the implementation of an adequate containment level. Considering the very limited persistence capacity of animal and human cells outside non-optimised culture conditions and the fact that many cell lines have a long history of safe use, it is generally considered unlikely that cell cultures may inherently cause harm to humans or the environment. The main hazard associated with the handling of animal cell cultures resides in the presence of adventitious pathogenic micro-organisms, which are often difficult to detect and hence less controllable. In contrast to their host cells, adventitious organisms can persist in more hostile conditions and may present risks for human health or the environment in case they are pathogenic (Bean et al. 1982; Walther and Ewald 2004; Kallio et al. 2006; Kramer et al. 2006). For this reason, a risk assessment of cell cultures will frequently lead to a risk assessment of the potential adventitious contaminants, the organisms used for cell\u2019s immortalisation (viruses, viral sequences, etc.) and/or the micro-organisms intentionally used to experimentally infect them. Though the assignment of biosafety containment level requirements cannot be generalised and should be performed on a case-by-case basis, it is recognised that most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination in order to mitigate potential risks for the laboratory worker. Except for authenticated cell lines proved to present no risk, the activities involving cell cultures from human or primate origin should generally be performed under containment level 2 involving the use of a class II Biosafety cabinet and Good Laboratory Practice.",
