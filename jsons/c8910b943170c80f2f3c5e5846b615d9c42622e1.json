In common human diseases, unlike classical Mendelian disorders, genetic factors generally have small effect sizes, are multifactorial, and are highly pleiotropic. Likewise, mouse genetic models of disease often have pleiotropic and overlapping phenotypes. Moreover, phenotypic descriptions in the literature in both human and mouse are often poorly characterized and difficult to compare directly. Methods: In this report, human genetic association results from the literature are summarized with regard to replication, disease phenotype, and gene specific results; and organized in the context of a systematic disease ontology. Similarly summarized mouse genetic disease models are organized within the Mammalian Phenotype ontology. Human and mouse disease and phenotype based gene sets are identified. These disease gene sets are then compared individually and in large groups through dendrogram analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Results: Human disease and mouse phenotype gene sets are shown to group into disease and phenotypically relevant groups at both a coarse and fine level based on gene sharing.",

GAD contains curated information on candidate gene studies and more recently on genome wide association studies. It builds on the curation of the CDC HuGENet info literature database [3] in part by adding molecular and ontological annotation creating a bridge between epidemiological and molecular information. This allows the large-scale integration of disease based genetic association information with genomic and molecular information as well as with the software tools and computational approaches and that use genomic information [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . This report is a summary and analysis of the genes and diseases with positive associations in the Genetic Association Database with regard to replication, comparisons between diseases, and within broad phenotypic disease classes.

If n is chosen more than 1, the distance is then assumed to be a mean of those replicates. The power P is what distinguished between the Fitch and Neighbor-Joining methods. For the Fitch-Margoliash method P is 2.0 and for Neighbor-Joining method it is 0.0. As running Fitch took a long time when the gene-set size was huge (weeks for the human gene-sets and months for the mouse gene-sets), Neighbor-Joining method was used to create the replicate dendrograms (not shown) after randomizing the input order for greater confidence. The resulting coefficient matrix files were displayed using the Phylodraw graphics program [18] .",

Table 1 is a summary of the number of positively associated human genes in each MeSH human disease class. As represented by these disease classes the GAD database covers a broad selection of diseases falling into major disease classes including; aging studies, cancer, immune disorders, psychiatric diseases, metabolic conditions, pharmacogenomic studies, and studies of chemical dependency, among others. Similarly, each record in the phenotype files from the MGI phenotype database represents a unique mouse gene specific genetic model. Table 2 shows the general categories represented by the mouse phenotype summary files and the number of mouse genes found in each top level phenotype class. The mouse files contain a greater number of intermediate developmental and morphological phenotypes (e.g. insulin resistance, absent CD4+ T cells, abnormal spatial learning) while the human files tend to comprise a greater number of end stage clinical disease phenotypes (e.g. Type 2 Diabetes, multiple sclerosis, autism). Table 3 introduces examples of human genes from fundamental biological pathways that have been consistently associated with major disease phenotypes highlighting the sometimes-broad pleiotropic effects that major regulatory molecules have on multiple disease phenotypes. Genes such as NOS3, nitric oxide synthase 3, regulating nitrous oxide production; HLA-DQB1, the MHC class II molecule DQ beta 1, involved in antigen presentation; ACE, angiotensin I converting enzyme, central to the renin-angiotensin system and PPARG, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, regulating transcription in pathways important in lipid metabolism are examples of genes that affect multiple tissues and different organ systems through the complex course of disease progression. Importantly, all the mouse orthologs of the human genes in Table 3 have experimentally determined phenotypes that are similar or broadly overlapping with human clinical disease phenotypes (see below).",

That is, HLA-DQB1 in antigen presentation, CTLA4 in regulation of the expansion of T cell subsets, and PTPN22 in T cell receptor signaling, all contributing to immunological aberrations and progression to clinical disease, as in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes. In other cases, the same gene has been associated with quite different clinical phenotypes, suggesting sharing of complex biological mechanisms at a more underlying level.

Tables 6 and S3 are comparisons of the genes that overlap between the human and mouse gene lists (Table S1 and  Table S2 ) showing mouse gene symbols and their human orthologs. Table 6 is a small subset of selected gene-phenotype cross species comparisons. Even though in some cases the human studies have not been replicated, there is often a striking concordance between human disease phenotypes and mouse genetically determined phenotypes. For example, the human gene inhibin alpha (INHA) has been associated with premature ovarian failure [32] , and shows mouse phenotypes of abnormal ovarian follicle morphology, female infertility, and ovarian hemorrhage [33] , among other phenotypes relevant to human disease. Similarly, in humans the engrailed homeobox 2 gene (EN2) has been associated with autistic disorder [34] while the comparison to mouse En2 has genetic mutations involved in abnormal social integration, spatial learning, and social/consecutive interaction, among others [35] . Importantly, the few mouse studies highlighted above, and many found in the main table S3, were published after the corresponding human genetic population based epidemiological studies. Given concerns of false positives and publication bias in human genetic association studies, direct comparisons to related mouse phenotypes may provide supporting evidence that a given gene may be relevant to a specific human disease phenotype.

This is evident in gene sharing, as mentioned above, and equally in the overlap of biological pathways between related disorders. Using GAD disease gene sets, Venn diagram comparisons among related disorders shows modest gene sharing. However, when gene sets are then placed into biological pathways and compared by Venn analysis, there is a marked increase in the overlap in pathways between related disorders. This was not found in gene sets from unrelated disorders. For example, major autoimmune disorders quite often share endophenotypes of lymphoproliferation, autoantibody production, and alterations in apoptosis, as well as other immune cellular and biochemical aberrations. As shown in Figure 1a , genes that have been positively associated with type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease show a modest overlap. However, when individual gene sets are fitted into biological pathways, then compared for overlap of pathway membership, there is a striking increase in the overlap at the pathway level. This is true in a comparison of gene and pathways for type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity as well (Figure 1b ). This pattern of major pathway overlap does not seem to occur between unrelated disorders, such as insulin resistance, rheumatoid arthritis and bipolar disorder (Figure 1c ). This disease related sharing at the pathway level suggests common regulatory mechanisms between these disorders and that the original positive associations are not necessarily due to random chance alone.",

Figure 2 shows a broad based dendrogram comparison based on gene sharing between 480 GAD disease gene sets, using gene sets each containing at least 3 genes. A striking feature of this analysis is that at a coarse level, major disease groups cluster together in space demonstrating shared genes between major clinically important disease groups.

            "text": "Heart Failure ADRA2C (5) phenotypes are found close in space, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. This overlap due to gene sharing recapitulates an overlap in clinical characteristics between these related disorders. Similarly, phenotypes within the metabolic group related to diabetes are closely aligned in space including; insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia. This close apposition of related disease phenotypes and sub-phenotypes at both a coarse and fine level is a consistent feature of the overall display. The human gene sets used in creating this tree diagram can be found in Table S6[ 46] . It is important to emphasize that this display and the distance relationships between diseases are calculated through an unbiased gene-sharing algorithm independent of disease phenotype labels and not as a result of an imposed logical hierarchy or an ontological annotation system. This grouping of major disease phenotypes based solely on gene sharing provides supporting evidence that the underlying disease based gene sets may have a fundamental relevance to disease and may not be reported in the literature by chance alone. Dendrogram analysis of mouse phenotypic gene sets Figure 3 is a similar dendrogram to the human tree using 1056 mouse phenotypic gene sets, using gene sets each containing at least 10 genes. This was produced using the same gene sharing algorithm as for the human gene sets in Figure 2 . As with the human dendrogram, the mouse tree displays informative groupings at both a coarse and fine level. This tree groups into major groupings nominally assigned as brain development and brain function, embryonic development, cardiovascular, reproduction, inflammation, renal function, bone development, metabolism, and skin/hair development. The identification of major groupings emphasizing developmental processes reflects the emphasis of gene knockouts and developmental models resulting in observable morphological traits and less so with regard to end stage clinical diseases as in the human dendrogram. Like the human dendrogram ( Figure 2 ) discrete major functional groupings in the mouse dendrogram suggests that individual experimental observations are not random. Fundamental complex processes such as metabolism, cardiovascular phenomena, and developmental processes are integrated by extensive sharing of related pliotropic genes. Moreover, like the human tree, fine structure in the mouse tree shows related mouse phenotypes are closely positioned in space. For example, in the metabolism major grouping, the individual phenotypes of body mass, adipose phenotypes, and weight gain are closely positioned. Similarly, in the brain function group, the behavioral phenotypes of anxiety, exploration, and responses to novel objects are found next to one another. This pattern is a fundamental feature of this tree. Like the human tree, the mouse dendrogram shown here is based solely on a gene sharing algorithm using genes assigned to individual phenotypes. It is not based on an imposed predetermined hierarchy or ontology. Importantly, unlike the human tree, the information contained in the mouse tree is derived from individual independent mouse genetic studies and phenotypic observations and not from large case controlled population based epidemiological studies. Controversial issues such as publication bias or study size which confound human genetic association studies are not as relevant here in the context of studies of experimentally determined individual mouse gene knockouts and related studies. The mouse gene sets used in creating this tree diagram can be found in Table S7[ 47] . Hierarchical clustering of human and mouse gene sets Hierarchical clustering has become a common tool in the analysis of large molecular data sets [48] allowing identification of similar patterns in a scalable fashion from the whole experiment down to a level of fine structure. To provide further evidence of disease relevance and biological content contained in both the human and mouse gene sets hierarchical clustering was performed on both human and mouse. Four hundred and eighty human gene sets were clustered producing 46 major disease clusters. In the mouse, clustering was performed on 2067 mouse phenotype gene sets, using gene sets containing at least 3 genes. This resulted in 165 major subgroups of functional phenotypic specificity. Hierarchical clustering is shown for human [Additional file 1 and Additional file 2] and for mouse [Additional file 3 and Additional file 4]. Like the human and mouse dendograms, this hierarchical clustering showed functional disease grouping at both a coarse group level and at a fine level within major phenotypic groupings. These clusters in both human and mouse falling into closely defined broad functional groups as well as closely related clinical, physiological, and developmental phenotypes demonstrates a general pattern of relevance to disease in their original underlying genetic associations. As in the dendrogram displays, this suggests that the genes nominally positively associated to these disorders, drawn from the medical literature, are not pervasively randomly assigned or due to a widespread pattern of random false positives associations.",

Moreover, we identify disease based genes sets for 1,317 human disease phenotypes as well as 5,142 mouse experimentally determined phenotypes.

In addition, the GAD database draws on association studies of broad quality with different degrees of detail provided. Although all human genetic association studies discussed here have been individually determined to be positively associated with a disease or phenotype in a peer reviewed journal, we make no assertion that any individual study is correct and we recognize the controversy in the genetics community regarding statistical and biological significance of genetic association studies. Moreover, although the GAD database contains information on polymorphism and variation, and each GAD record is fundamentally based on polymorphism, this report does not consider variation or polymorphism in the summaries shown. Likewise, mouse genetic models in many cases are weighted to gene knockouts which may not be necessarily be directly representative of multifactorial human common complex disease.",
