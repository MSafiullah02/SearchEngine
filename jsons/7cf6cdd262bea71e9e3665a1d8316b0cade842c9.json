            "text": "Infl uenza A (H1N1) virus belongs to the family of Orthomyxoviridae , the species of infl uenza A (H1N1) virus. The typical virus particle is an enveloped sphere with a diameter of 80-120 nm. On the envelope, there are many glycoprotein protrusions arrayed radially, including column-like hemagglutinin (HA), mushroom-shaped neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein M2. A symmetrically spiral nucleocapsid is inside the virus envelope, with a diameter of 10 nm and ringlike structures in both ends. As a new mutant, infl uenza A (H1N1) virus is a single-negative-stranded RNA with a genome weighing about 13.6 kb. The virus strain of infl uenza A (H1N1) is the result of recombined eight gene fragments of infl uenza virus in different sizes, including HI, NP, and NS from classical swine infl uenza virus, PB2 and PA from avian infl uenza virus in North America, PB1 from human infl uenza A (H3N2) virus, and N1 and M from swine infl uenza virus in Europe and Asia. A scholarly study on ferret models was reported to have fi ndings that infl uenza A (H1N1) virus is more pathogenic than seasonal infl uenza virus because it survives in the small intestine while seasonal infl uenza virus fails to. Infl uenza A (H1N1) virus is sensitive to common disinfectants such as ethanol, iodophor, and tincture of iodine and can be inactivated by oxidant, olefi n acid, halogen compounds, and calcium oxychloride. Infl uenza A (H1N1) virus is heat intolerable, which can be inactivated at a temperature of 56 \u00b0C for 30 min. Its infectivity can be rapidly destructed by direct sunlight for 40-48 h or ultraviolet radiation.",

            "text": "Infl uenza A (H1N1) virus contains \u03b1-2,6-sialic acid glycosides and \u03b1-2,3-sialic acid glycosides. After its infection to the human body, it can replicate in epithelial cells of the whole respiratory tract to invade bronchi, bronchioles, and alveolar epithelial cells in large quantities. The hemagglutinin binds to the sialic acid on the surface of cells to invade the cells, with following replication of genetic materials in a large quantity to produce viral proteins. The cell membrane envelopes the genetic materials of the virus and viral protein, giving rise to another sphere from the cell-like budding. The new virus adheres to the cell via the bond between hemagglutinin and sialic acid. After that, neuraminidase hydrolyzes the sialic acid to release the new virus from its host cell and the released new virus can invade another cell. By autopsy of the death cases from infl uenza A (H1N1), the pathological examination of the pulmonary tissues demonstrated extensive epithelial degeneration and necrosis of bronchi and bronchioles as well as exudates containing neutrophils and monocytes fi lling the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. The critical factors determining the onset and development of infl uenza A (H1N1) include the loading dose of infl uenza A (H1N1) virus, the intrapulmonary infi ltration of the infl ammatory cells, and the release of infl ammatory mediators. The early animal studies about infl uenza A (H1N1) virus collected in 1918 have demonstrated infi ltration of large quantities of neutrophils and macrophages in rat pulmonary tissues, waterfall-like releases of enzymes and cytokines (including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-2) by infl ammatory cells, and mutually enhanced pathological effects by cytokines and infl ammatory cells. Consequently, pulmonary lesions, pulmonary dysfunction, decreased body weight, and general fatigue occur. The studies on animals inoculated with HA DNA infl uenza virus vaccine indicated that the increase of released IFN-\u03b3 is more than the released IL-4 and the replication of infl uenza A (H5N1) virus declines, both of which have quantityeffect relationship with the amount of vaccines. These fi ndings indicated that the immune reactions against infl uenza virus infection have bias on Th cellular immune reactions and the production of cytokine Th2 is related to large quantity replications of infl uenza virus. By clinical trials, it has been found that strong cytokine IRF-3 reaction can reduce IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, and MCP-1 and partially reduce TNF-\u03b1, which is related to the severity of infl uenza A (H5N1) symptoms and viral replication. Recent studies have demonstrated that the virus-induced cytokine (IFN, TNF-\u03b1) reactions are even weaker than seasonal infl uenza despite the differences of genotypes and antigenicity between infl uenza A (H1N1) and seasonal infl uenza. The relationship between the weaker virus-induced cytokine reactions and mild clinical manifestations of infl uenza A (H1N1) remains elusive. The susceptibility of young adults is possibly caused by serious damages to the autoimmune balance and tissues resulted from more released infl ammatory mediators by immune cells due to more sensitive immunity in young adults and thus the more intense immune responses after infection of infl uenza A (H1N1) virus.",

In the early stage of infection, diffuse infl ammations cause laryngeal, tracheal, and bronchial edema and infl ammatory cell infi ltration that is predominantly lymphocytes and histiocytes. Necrotizing tracheobronchitis occurs following the shedding of ciliated columnar epithelium in the bronchi, with ulcerations and shedding of bronchial mucosa. There are alveolar capillary congestion and alveolar hemorrhage, with the alveolar lumens fi lled with liquid exudates of fi brins. Alveolar edema and fusion of substantial lobular infl ammatory exudates occur in alveoli lined with transparent pneumonocytic membrane. With the progress of the conditions, pulmonary interstitial tissues are involved, with reduced alveolar gas content, pulmonary consolidation, and fi brosis. Li et al. reported that pulmonary diffuse fi brosis and alveolar lesions occur in the serious and critical cases, with alveolar edema and substantial lobular infl ammatory exudates.

The multiple scattering foci integrate rapidly and progress into extensive lesions to involve multiple segments and lobes (Figs. 22.14 , 22.15 , 22.16 , 22.17 , 22.18 , and 22.19 ). In the convalescence stage, most of the foci are absorbed, possibly with residual cords or grid-shaped shadows and localized pulmonary emphysema. Bao et al. reported the fi ndings of residual pulmonary giant bullae in the convalescence stage, which may be caused by excessive ventilation of local lungs due to involved terminal bronchioles by infl ammation.",

( d , e ) Transverse T2WI demonstrates slightly high or high signal in the thalamus and large fl akes of high signals in the bilateral centrum ovale. ( f ) Sagittal T2WI demonstrates abnormal high signal in the thalamus, mesencephalon, pons, and cerebellum. ( g ) Contrast transverse T1WI demonstrates slight enhancement of the centrum ovale. ( h ) Contrast coronal T1WI demonstrates abnormal enhancement of the brainstem and centrum ovale as well as ringshaped enhancement foci in the bilateral thalamus. ( i ) Autopsy demonstrates hemorrhagic necrosis of the bilateral thalamus (Note: The case and images are fromLyon JB, et al. Pediatr Radiol .   Case Study 5 A boy aged 7 years was hospitalized due to mental confusion and incoherent talking. He had experienced upper respiratory tract infection 2 weeks ago and had a past history of bronchial asthma. By laboratory test, ALT 5-25 IU/L and complete blood cell, blood sugar, and liver and lung function levels were normal. By cultures of nasopharyngeal secretion and throat swab, he was positive for infl uenza A (H1N1) virus antibodies. CT scanning fails to demonstrate any space-occupying lesions and cerebral edema. In 12 h after hospitalization, generalized tonic convulsion occurred which then progressed into decorticate posture. His GCS is 3/15 (E1V1M1) and the pupils are 2.5 mm in orthophoria with sluggish reaction to light. In 34 h after hospitalization, the conditions continued to deteriorate with dilated and fi xed pupils. Death occurred at day 4 after hospitalization.Fig. 22.5 Infl uenza A (H1N1) complicated by acute necrotizing encephalopathy. ( a ) MR imaging demonstrates bilateral symmetric abnormalities and abnormal high T2WI signal in the deep white matter of the cerebral hemisphere, caudate nucleus, lenticular nucleus, internal capsule, lateral nucleus of the thalamus and its posterior area, corpus callosum, and tegmentum of the brainstem. ( b ) By autopsy, the genu of the corpus callosum, mammillary body, and splenium of the corpus callosum are demonstrated from sagittal perspectives. The pathological changes include diffuse cerebral edema, vascular lesions, and necrosis, without obvious perivascular demyelination. In the necrotic area, the necrotic cells are demonstrated with illusive shadows. In the background of rare cells and swollen nerve fi ber network, karyopyknosis or fragments of karyolysis and erythrocytic exudation can be found, with no astrocytes and hyperplasic microglia. Ischemic atrophy and pericellular edema are found in many neurons in the cortex of the cerebrum, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem. Thrombosis is found in some minor blood vessels of the brainstem. Diffuse ischemic change of neurons and thrombosis in the brainstem and cerebellar pyramid are pathological changes secondary to cerebral edema. ( c ) There is a 110 \u03bcmm blood vessel in the head of the left caudate nucleus. In addition, exudation of lymphocytes and neutrophils as well as karyolysis with/without accompanying intraluminal thrombosis can be found in the vascular wall with FVL and perivascular space.
