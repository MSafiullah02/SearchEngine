            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) severely affects both the breeding and growing sectors of the swine industry. In the breeding sector, PRRS causes abortions, stillborns, mummified piglets, pre-weaning mortality, and embryonic death (Lunney et al., 2016). It was estimated that $302 million (~45%) out of the annual $663 million in costs associated with problems caused by PRRS are due to losses in the breeding sector (Holtkamp et al., 2013). This was very different than estimates from a previous study by Neumann et al. (2005), where only ~12% was due to breeding herd losses. A relatively large amount of work has been done on the growing pig sector to reduce the economic impact of PRRS (Lunney et al., 2011) and less attention has been focused on reducing the effects of the disease in breeding herds (Lunney et al., 2016). One reason is that, prior to the availability of high-density genotyping, genetic analyses required a pedigree, which is typically not available for sows at the commercial level due to pooling of semen. Because nucleus and multiplier herds are managed to maximize biosecurity and minimize the risk of exposure to major pathogens such as PRRS, studies on outbreaks in herds with pedigreed sows are rare. Although pedigrees are not required with genomics, genotyping is still relatively expensive, and it still requires high-quality data, which is typically collected in nucleus herds. It is also much more expensive to set up experimental infection trials for reproductive traits in sows, as done in the PRRS Host Genomics Consortium nursery pig trials (Lunney et al., 2011). Breeding for increased resistance to PRRS is difficult in growing pigs and the problem becomes even more difficult for reproductive performance.",

Since antibody levels under a real challenge may be impractical for commercial breeding programs, Ser\u00e3o et al. (2016) suggested that antibody following vaccination with a modified live virus (MLV) could be used as an indicator trait to select for reproductive performance under PRRS (Madapong et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014) is the only study that has investigated genetic relationships between antibody level and reproductive performance under a PRRSV challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to validate these findings in a larger, independent PRRSV outbreak study.",

(2009) first split reproductive data from a commercial herd that experienced a PRRS outbreak into healthy and PRRS phases and found that splitting the data based on trait rolling averages was better than using diagnostic lab confirmation dates. Estimated genetic correlations of reproductive performance between healthy and PRRS phases ranged from \u22120.13 to 0.98, although many genetic correlations were moderate or low between phases (Lewis et al., 2009). Lewis et al. (2009) only separated traits into two phases, while it is known that PRRS is a persistent infection (Wills et al., 2003; Lunney et al., 2016), suggesting that the post-outbreak phase may need to be considered as a separate phase, creating three phases (prior, during, and after the outbreak). In addition, estimates of genetic correlations between reproductive traits within phase may also give some insight into how disease changes the relationship among traits during the different phases of an outbreak.",

Reaction norm models are an application of random regression (longitudinal) models that regress the response variable on a continuous environmental variable. These reaction norm models yield estimates of breeding values for an intercept term that is highly correlated to estimates of breeding values from routine genetic evaluations (Knap and Su, 2008) and estimated breeding values for a slope term that describes the additive genetic sensitivity to changes in the environment (when using an additive genetic relationship matrix). Reaction norm models have been used to analyze disease outbreak data by regressing phenotypes on estimates of continuous farm-year-week effects or on an index of challenge load from multiple traits (Mathur et al., 2014; Rashidi et al., 2014; Herrero-Medrano et al., 2015).",

These farms included pedigreed purebred Yorkshire (YORK) and Landrace (LR) sows. Farms 1 and 3 contained both breeds, while farm 2 contained only the LR breed. After suspect abortions, samples were sent for diagnostics and the 1-7-4 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern (strain) of PRRS was confirmed by PCR analysis. This strain is a highly virulent strain. A nearby farm first broke with this PRRSV strain. To protect some high indexing sows in farm 1, they were preemptively sent to a quarantine facility to be tested for PRRS. After clearing these tests, these sows were then transferred to one of the other farms to farrow. Farm 1 was confirmed positive on March 5 and was then depopulated to try to protect other nearby farms 2 and 3. Subsequently, farms 2 and 3 broke with PRRS and were then closed to new animals. Farm 2 was confirmed positive on April 16 (42 d after farm 1) and farm 3 on April 9 (35 d after farm 1). After the initial confirmed outbreak with several positive samples, all sows on farms 2 and 3 were inoculated with live virus of a 1-7-4 RFLP pattern (strain) that was isolated at each farm (same strain) approximately 3 wk later, on May 5 for farm 2 and on April 30 for farm 3. Inoculation was intranasal at farm 2 and intramuscular at farm 3. All sows were injected with an MLV vaccine ~30 d after the inoculation. Blood samples for antibody levels were taken from the anterior vena cava with vacutainer serum tubes from sows on farm 2 on June 18 and from farm 3 on June 16, 17, and 19. This was ~60 d after the initial outbreak. Antibody levels taken at this time point should have plateaued for most animals (Lunney et al., 2016). Serum tubes were centrifuged at the farm and these serum samples were sent to Kansas State University for analysis. Antibody level against the PRRSV N-protein was measured using a fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (Luminex) and converted into a standardized sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio using positive and negative controls. This assay is conceptually similar to an indirect ELISA.",

To make all traits comparable, estimates of FYW effects for each trait were standardized by their respective overall SDs (based on the variance estimated for FYW using lme4 in R; Bates et al., 2015) and plotted over time (Figure 2). Visual appraisal was used to split the data for each trait into three phases because it was known when the outbreak occurred (dates given above, similar to Ser\u00e3o et al., 2014). Preliminary analysis showed only minor changes in variance component estimates (<0.1 for genetic correlations) when slightly different dates (by 1 or 2 wk) were used to split the data into phases because these different dates changed the data sets very little. The PRRS outbreak phase for farm 1 was identified to be from March 12 to April 1 (20 d) and also from May 7 to May 27 (20 d), after sows were moved. The PRRS outbreak phase for farms 2 and 3 was from May 7 to August 5 (90 d). Based on these dates, data from each reproductive performance trait were separated into three traits (prior, during, and after), which were designated with subscripts p, d, and a, respectively, on the trait acronym (e.g., TNBp for TNB prior to the outbreak). Transition periods were masked for this analysis by removing data just prior to and after the outbreak phase (following Herrero-Medrano et al., 2015) because these records represented a \u201cgrey area\u201d for classification. For farm 1, data from 1 wk prior to the first outbreak and from the 3 wk between the two outbreaks were removed. For farm 2, data from 1 wk prior to and 2 wk after the outbreak were removed. For farm 3, data from 1 wk prior to the outbreak phase and 7 wk after the outbreak were removed. The latter were removed because rolling averages for TNB fluctuated continuously during these weeks, possibly from a rebound after the outbreak, which made it unclear how these data should be classified (see Figure 2).",

However, estimates of genetic variances and covariances for NBA at given FYW levels were unaffected, as expected. Estimates of the genetic variance of the intercept and slope ranged from 0.52 to 0.81 and from 0.07 to 1.21, respectively. All estimates of the genetic covariance between intercept and slope were positive (0.11 to 0.51). Estimates of the genetic correlation between the intercept and slope were 0.54 \u00b1 0.35, 0.24 \u00b1 0.50, and 0.52 \u00b1 0.36 for the raw, Legendre, and the polynomial (pol) function of ASReml, respectively. Estimates of residual variance increased slightly from the first FYW level to the second (estimated from 12.21 to 12.73) and then reduced as the FYW effect increased (10.54, 8.70, and 6.84). Figure 3 shows estimates of genetic covariances (left) and correlations (right) from the reaction norm model for NBA between FYW levels which, as indicated, were the same for all three parameterizations. Estimates of genetic covariances (diagonals) showed the expected quadratic trend (given the first-order model) and were negative only between the most extreme FYW classes. Estimates of genetic correlations for NBA between FYW levels showed two fairly distinct blocks during the healthy and diseased phases (diseased in the top left, healthy in the bottom right). The transition from diseased to healthy started for NBA FYW effects around \u22121 (with a very small overlap of the two phases, see Figure 2). Genetic correlations between the two blocks were moderate, except for the very extreme FYW levels, which was consistent with the multi-trait analysis of traits defined by phase.",

Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014) reported a heritability of 0.45 \u00b1 0.13 for S/P ratio after a PRRS outbreak in a multiplier herd in Canada, which was validated in a more complex independent study (Ser\u00e3o et al., 2016). The estimate of heritability of S/P ratio from the current study was, however, substantially lower at 0.17 \u00b1 0.05. Estimates of genetic correlations of S/P ratio with reproductive traits also did not completely agree with previous results, except for the genetic correlation of S/P ratio with LNSB (Ser\u00e3o et al., 2014). Although this is favorable, most of the prenatal mortality (68%) during the PRRS outbreak in this study was due to mummified piglets, as mentioned above. This is important because although S/P ratio was more correlated with LNSB, it would not change overall mortality as much because more piglet mortality stems from mummified piglets. Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014) found that S/P ratio tended to have moderate/strong genetic correlations with reproduction traits, ranging from \u22120.72 (NSB) to 0.73 (NBA); the lowest estimate in absolute value was 0.27 (NBD). The only genetic correlation that was similar in the current study was for LNSB (\u22120.73). Both TNB and NBA were not strongly associated with S/P ratio in the current study. Note, however, that these estimates come with large standard errors when dealing with small sample sizes and lowly heritable reproductive traits, therefore strong conclusions cannot be drawn until further studies are conducted.",

            "text": "One notable difference between the current study and the studies of Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014, 2016) is the use of different antibody assays for semi-quantification of antibody levels. The IDEXX PRRS X3 ELISA (at the same lab) was used in both Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014) and Serao et al. (2016), while the Luminex (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) microsphere assay was utilized in the present study. Although the IDEXX is considered an industry/research gold standard for measuring PRRS antibody (Sattler et al., 2014), the microsphere (or microbead) assay is rising in popularity because the Luminex multiplex system allows for the detection of numerous analytes within a single biological sample, saving cost, time, and labor (Lin et al., 2011). The Luminex assay was also used by the same lab in the study of Hess et al. (2018) on nursery pigs following experimental PRRSV infection, resulting in a moderate-to-high heritability estimate. The microbead assay is not a traditional ELISA but is conceptually similar to an indirect ELISA, as both measure antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) protein (inside the complete PRRS virus). Lin et al. (2011) compared an earlier version of the standard single plex ELISA (IDEXX Herdchek PRRSV 2XR kit) and the microsphere-based immunoassay and found the spearman rank correlation to be 0.72 for PRRS antibody. The sensitivity and specificity between the assays were 91% and 93% for PRRS in young pigs, respectively (\u03ba coefficient of 0.67). Commonly, young pigs are used for testing and validating assay results for several reasons (cost, ease of sampling, availability, etc.). In adult pigs, however, 64% (16/25) of samples were found to be positive by the Luminex assay but negative by the IDEXX HerdChek PRRS X3 assay (Gim\u00e9nez-Lirola et al., 2014). Gim\u00e9nez-Lirola et al. (2014) used the newest IDEXX (HerdChek PRRS X3), the same test used in Ser\u00e3o et al., (2014, 2016). Adults pigs (sows and boars) may have higher background reactivity than young pigs (Gim\u00e9nez-Lirola et al., 2014), possibly due to a more mature immune system and antigens seen later in life and will need to be investigated further. Although we do not have direct evidence that the differences in variance components estimated between the present study and Ser\u00e3o et al., (2014, 2016) can be attributed to the differences between the IDEXX and Luminex platform, it should be a major consideration in future research, along with the age of the animal being tested.",

These could include other aspects of the assay such as in-house diagnostic target variations, time of year, the strain of the virus, sample processing, and other unknown environmental effects. In contrast to Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014), sows in the current study were inoculated 3 wk after the confirmed outbreak, followed by MLV vaccination. Vaccination is not expected to impact antibody levels at 40 d after inoculation, as a secondary type of response in a relatively short time after infection is not expected due to the persistency of infection of the PRRS virus (Lunney et al., 2016; discussed below). However, it still could contribute to differences. Typically, antibody response studies in pigs are conducted in designed experiments with one injection given simultaneously to all animals. In a natural disease challenge, this consistency is lost and sows in a large farm are consistently re-exposed to antigens, some possibly due to \u201crebound\u201d animals (Boddicker et al., 2012). In Ser\u00e3o et al. (2016), antibody levels were measured on gilts following acclimation across many commercial farms, which represented a range of times following exposure, either through infection or MLV vaccination, again strengthening the idea that some of these other factors may not play a large role.",

These will continue to be an issue as what is best for measuring antibody response in research (i.e., this study) may not be optimal for production and clearing the virus from a commercial farm, such as inoculation and vaccination observed in the current study. This may provide some insight into the difficulty of conducting this type of research in field conditions and therefore alternatives will be needed (e.g., separate, carefully designed challenge studies in sows). Perhaps other measures such as interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) response after inoculation might be useful, along with antibody response. Collecting antibody response at multiple time points may also be helpful to determine the approximate date of infection, but this would be expensive and not feasible on a commercial farm.",

Trends in heritabilities between phases generally followed results by Lewis et al. (2009). Heritability for NBA was lower during the outbreak, while estimates of heritability for mortality traits were higher during the outbreak, most likely due to the increased incidence of mortality under PRRS challenge. Heritability of TNB was not affected by the PRRS phase like the other traits but was after the outbreak. Biologically, this makes sense, as sows that farrowed during the outbreak were bred prior to the outbreak and all fetuses would be counted in the total born. However, sows bred during the outbreak farrowed later during or after the outbreak, which affects the total born observed due to possibly fewer oocytes being fertilized or fetuses being absorbed. There is no verification of this because pregnancies were not evaluated by ultrasound. Low to moderate genetic correlations for reproduction traits between prior to and during the PRRS phase likely indicate the influence of disease resistance QTL during the outbreak phase, making them different traits. Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014) found similar trends as observed in the present study for estimates of heritability prior to and during the outbreak for NBM, NBD and NSB but their estimates of heritability for NBA was higher during the outbreak.",

For instance, a new PRRS strain that developed in China in the last decade shows very different clinical signs than normal strains (see Figure 2 from Tian et al., 2007).

A finding from this research was that estimated genetic correlations may support keeping the time period after the PRRS phase as a separate trait from prior to the PRRS outbreak, although standard errors were large. PRRS can be a persistent infection (Lunney et al., 2016) and, thus, it is possible that PRRS still affects reproductive performance after the outbreak has cleared, perhaps subclinically. Lunney et al. (2016) discussed the three stages of a PRRS infection: acute, persistent, and extinct. The virus can persist in tonsils and lymph nodes and has been identified in animals as long as 175 to 251 d postinfection (Wills et al., 2003; Molina, 2008), although most cleared within three to four months (Wills et al., 2003). In the present study, the after phase included ~4 mo of data. It is possible that the large farm sizes contributed to the persistent nature of the infection. It is also possible that the less than one genetic correlation between traits prior and after the outbreak was caused by genotype-by-environment interactions due to reasons such as seasonality, which will need to be investigated further in another study. The outbreak phase for the current study was during the late spring/summer months.",

Any sow bred during the PRRS phase could suffer reduced TNB from reduced fertilization, embryos not surviving, or fetuses being absorbed. In contrast, most sows that farrowed during the outbreak phase were bred during the healthy phase prior to the outbreak and, thus, TNB should not be severely affected due to the piglets already being fully-formed, as observed in the present study, especially in farm 3. This was also reinforced by the low estimate of the genetic correlation for TNB between before and after the outbreak (0.32 \u00b10.03). Thus, it may be better to consider leaving the after phase a separate trait or to remove this data for routine genetic evaluation. Further research will be needed to determine how long this period extends.",

The phase prior to infection represents typical variance components for litter size without major disease (Su et al., 2007; Putz et al., 2015). Not separating data from herds that experience disease outbreaks into three phases could affect estimates of genetic correlations between traits (e.g., TNB and NBA or their genetic correlation with mortality traits). For example, the genetic correlation between TNB and LNBD was 0.28 \u00b1 0.26 prior to infection and 0.56 \u00b1 0.23 during the PRRS outbreak.

            "text": "One possible downside of the use of reaction norms for analysis of disease outbreak data is that they do not differentiate records obtained prior to and after the outbreak. Separate stressors may cause dips in performance. This may be a disadvantage of the reaction norm models, especially for other situations such as outbreaks from different pathogens or different strains of the same virus (observed in Herrero-Medrano et al., 2015). Multivariate analyses may also not be able to disentangle causes if multiple pathogens are involved in the infection. In Herrero-Medrano et al. (2015), both PRRS and a coronavirus caused outbreaks that led to a high challenge load (described by Mathur et al., 2014) of over 15 index units (the challenge load). The reaction norm model treats both of these outbreaks being very similar traits (in terms of regressor values, here the FYW effects), when in fact they most likely have different genetic backgrounds in terms of genetic resistance. For example, two FYW effects around \u22121 NBA may be the result of separate environmental changes; one could be the result of porcine epidemic diarrhea and the other from heat stress for example. Any FYW effect would be a combination of any management environments and challenges/stressors. Regardless of this, given enough data, these models should still result in sows that are more resilient/robust to environmental challenges. The advantage of the reaction norm is that it would average over all of these effects in one parsimonious model without regard to specific causes. Knap and Su (2008) stressed the need to have large datasets for reaction norm models to be effective. The optimal breeding objective should include general resilience/robustness to any number of stressors, including different diseases, not to single diseases or stressors. Therefore, for the reaction norm models to be effective, it would be advantageous to have a large number of environments classified from many different farms with as many different management practices as possible, such that the values used to regress on capture as many stressors and different environments as possible (Knap, 2005). When thinking about testing a sire, it would be best to have as many daughters in as many different farms/environments as possible. One issue is that there can be high leverage on the slope of the reaction norm slope for extreme FYW observations (Pool et al., 2000).",

Knap and Su (2008) utilized estimates for herd-year-season contemporary groups instead of herd-year-week contemporary groups used in the current analysis. The estimate of the genetic correlation between the intercepts and slopes from the three parameterizations used in the current study was different (as expected), although all were positive. This indicates that selection for improved NBA of animals with the standard animal model (related to the reaction norm intercept) would result in animals with greater reaction to changes in the environment. Again, as expected, estimates of genetic covariances and correlations between EBVs from each FYW from the reaction norm model were not affected by the parameterization of the model (Figure 3).",

Knap and Su (2008) found EBV from the multivariate animal model and EBV for the intercept terms from the reaction norm to be correlated 0.78 to 0.85, similar to the current analysis, which found correlations between 0.75 and 0.82 (for prior, during, and after for NBA). EBV from the reaction norm model at different levels of FYW was also correlated with EBV from the multivariate model. EBV from the reaction norm between \u2212-2 and +2 were moderate to highly correlated with EBV from the multivariate analysis (between 0.64 and 0.80). The highest correlation between the multivariate EBV and the EBV at \u22124 from the reaction norm was for NBA during the outbreak, as expected (0.38), however, this was at the very extreme of the outbreak phase. The EBV for the slope from the reaction norm was negatively correlated with the EBV at \u22124 (\u22120.55) and strongly positively correlated with EBV at 2 (0.91), which is as expected. Animals with EBV for the slope that deviate from zero are considered sensitive to environmental changes. Therefore, the optimum selection would be for animals with a high EBV for the intercept and an EBV for the slope close to zero, indicating high producing animals that produce uniformly (in ranking) across environmental gradients.",

Guy et al. (2012) discussed resilience to not only health challenges but also other environmental challenges. In commercial data, challenges for pigs can encompass social, environmental, metabolic, immunological, and human interactions (Mart\u00ednez-Mir\u00f3 et al., 2016). Seasonality encompasses effects of heat stress and disease and both affect FYW estimates. For instance, there is a positive seasonality effect during the summer months for pigs weaned/sow/year (Stalder, 2017). Sevillano et al. (2016) showed that seasonal infertility can be impacted by photoperiod and not just by ambient temperatures. So, as long as data are captured over long periods of time and plenty of heterogeneous environments, the reaction norm should also be thought of as general resilience, instead of only disease resilience. Of course, the multivariate model could also pick up effects from other stressors.",

            "text": "\nBishop and Woolliams (2014) stated that the requirement to measure resistance phenotypes is a rate-limiting step in breeding for disease resistance. One problem for both the multivariate and reaction norm models is that it is difficult to get enough records in the diseased phase to obtain accurate EBV for disease resilience; most of the information for either model will come from correlated data, i.e., from the \u201chealthy\u201d phase in the multivariate case. For the reaction norm model, most data are from healthy weeks when an outbreak has not occurred for an extended period of time. For instance, in farm 1 of Herrero-Medrano et al. (2015), only one outbreak occurred over a 6-yr span of the data and only five total outbreaks occurred in the three farms. The reaction norm is only observed on part of the FYW estimates for many animals, especially because many sows are culled early (especially in nucleus environments), although this is partially overcome by the use of the pedigree relationships. The use of random regression models for a reaction norm is different from many other situations in which random regression models are used for genetic analyses, such as milk yield in dairy cattle, growth or feed intake in pigs, and egg production in poultry. In those situations, animals have repeated records that span most of the lactation, growth period, or egg-laying cycle, leading to more accurate estimates of breeding values than obtained for the sparser reaction norm model (Knap and Su, 2008). In the current study, sows had between one and four records for the reaction norm model. Meyer (2005) stated that using higher order polynomials when a substantial proportion of animals have fewer records than the order of polynomials fitted can lead to erratic and implausible estimates. One should be careful before applying complex models to this type of data. The total range in estimates of NBA FYW effects was 6.43 on the original scale. A total of 47%, 70%, and 89% of sows had phenotypes in contemporary groups that ranged <0.5, 2.0, and 3.0, respectively, in NBA FYW effects (i.e., the x-axis). This may contribute to the poor accuracy referred to by Knap and Su (2008).",

Novel strains of PRRSV are continuing to show up because of the high mutation rate of the PRRS virus and predictive ability in terms of genetic correlations should be regularly checked. Antibody tests continue to change over time and differences among labs exist, although the HerdChek PRRS X3 antibody test seems to be very repeatable within and across labs (Kittawornrat et al., 2012). This possible instability over time in other antibody assays such as the Luminex (or future IDEXX assays) is risky for implementation into the swine breeding industry. One important validation needed is to send samples to multiple veterinary diagnostic labs and with multiple tests (e.g., IDEXX vs. Luminex) to verify results for each test and each lab to make sure genetic analyses agree. Perhaps even lab replicates will need to be performed to determine the repeatability. Thus, at this point, it is unclear whether selection on antibody response (possibly to PRRS vaccines) will be highly useful to the swine breeding industry.",

Standard errors for variance component estimates were large because of a relatively small dataset and lowly heritable traits, so no strong conclusions can be drawn. More research will be needed to understand why these results did not completely validate previous findings on S/P ratio heritability and genetic correlations with reproductive performance. It is possible that the differences in the antibody assay were the cause, but this is still unknown. The genetic correlation between reproductive performance prior to and during the PRRS outbreak was high for both TNB and NBA. The only negative genetic correlation between performance prior to and during the PRRS outbreak was for LNBM. TNB had a genetic correlation of 0.32 between prior to and after the outbreak. It may be useful to consider reproductive performance several months after the outbreak as a separate trait from performance prior to the outbreak, as sows farrowing after the outbreak were bred during the outbreak. The reaction norm model for NBA showed similar trends in genetic correlations as the multivariate model that considered reproductive performance prior, during, and after the outbreak as separate traits, although it considered data from prior and after the outbreak as having overlapping environments. Overall, future work will need to address some of the differences from previous research observed in the current study.",
