The lower incidence and regression of KS observed in those individuals fortunate enough to receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [6, 7] may result from a variety of effects. The first of these effects concerns immune reconstitution, as is demonstrated in organ transplant recipients, in whom a reduction in the immunosuppressive therapy prescribed to prevent organ rejection may lead to the regression of KS [8\u201310]. Furthermore, early during the AIDS epidemic, it was recognized through anecdotal reports that regression of KS occasionally occurred during monotherapy with the nucleoside analogue zidovudine [11]. Paradoxically, the disease worsens in some individuals with KS who continue receiving HAART, despite the controlling of virologic and immunologic parameters. This clinical response, known as \u201cimmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome,\u201d occurs secondary to an immune response against latent antigens in previously diagnosed pathogens [12]",

The authors studied 28 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 cytokine, growth factor, and chemotactic genes in 172 HHV-8\u2013infected individuals without KS with a median age of 75 years. An important hallmark of this investigation is that all participants were HIV seronegative, but all had evidence of HHV-8 infection, as demonstrated by 3 distinct assays. In addition, the authors chose to examine genetic susceptibility factors in the absence of KS, to minimize any influence of disease, or of retroviral-induced immunodeficiency, on the reported relationships",

It is conceivable that the haplotypes may influence these pleiotropic molecules functionally, as opposed to quantitatively, and it is very likely that other SNPs exist in other genes, with odds ratios associated with lytic infection similar to those observed here, despite the very wide confidence limits. In this study, certain polymorphisms in the genes for IL-1A, IL-13, and VEGF approached but did not reach significance.

Similarly, multiplexed protein arrays may not detect them adequately, because detection problems with inherently diverse and heterogeneous molecules are enormously complex [22]. Preservation conditions that are optimal for some cytokines will not be optimal for others, and some cytokines or growth factors will bind to and saturate their array targets in a linear manner, whereas others demonstrate nonlinear dynamics. Such problems will ultimately be resolved, perhaps by performing multiple sample reactions for each test, to maintain optimal conditions for certain groups of cytokines. However, this is an intrinsic problem of working with proteins that display far more chemical and structural heterogeneity than DNA sequences (e.g., the fact that blood-group antigens are not even proteins). A further level of biological complexity that may need to be considered is that cytokines are produced locally by almost all cell types and that they are transient; their detection, if not at a local viral microenvironment, may not reflect a true relationship",

However, as viral pressure on our genomes leads to new mutations (and their discovery), amino acid coding changes will occur, and such mutations are unlikely to become fixed unless they confer some degree of fitness on their hosts. Studies in the retroviral arena have provided striking insights here. Humans and chimpanzees have similar genomic structures in their antigen-presentation molecules and display 98.7% similarity at the nonrepetitive DNA level, having probably shared an ancestor \u223c5\u20136 million years ago [23, 24]. Many millennia ago, a cataclysmic event occurred in chimpanzees that led to a severe repertoire reduction at the orthologues of the HLA-A, -B, and -C loci. This loss of variability, which predated the chimpanzee subspeciation, has had no marked effects on other gene systems. Because chimpanzees have a natural resistance to the development of AIDS, the authors concluded that a retrovirus caused this ancient selective sweep [25]. Hence, the contemporary populations represent the offspring of AIDS-resistant chimpanzees\u2014the survivors of an HIV-like pandemic that took place in the distant past. Although there are few direct data that the HLA molecules that were preserved were those that produced particularly strong antiviral responses, an equally catastrophic series of events is now occurring in the human race, with the strong likelihood that profound genetic changes in a considerably reduced human population could be present in the future",

First, it enables an understanding of the viral and cellular Th1 and Th2 cytokine genes and gene products that are important for HHV-8 antibody production and the control of lytic infection. All chronic infections result in a shift in the Th1 and Th2 cytokine balance, and clinical KS likely occurs in the context of a Th1 response. Second, it highlights that the neoplastic consequences of HHV-8 infection may be significantly more likely to be apparent in those individuals with the susceptible haplotype. This, in turn, emphasizes the connection among cytokines, growth factors, and survival\u2014a situation that large randomized clinical studies are espousing [26]. Thus, the discovery of important host immunogenetic control mechanisms helps to elucidate new therapeutic targets. This clearly has implications for tumors caused by the closest relative of HHV-8, Epstein-Barr virus. Third, it raises the specter of viral selective pressure on our genome, analogous to the situation with retroviruses and chimpanzees. Individuals with the susceptible HHV-8 haplotype are probably more likely to develop tumors, and HHV-8 will therefore exert negative pressure in them, despite a more conducive replicative milieu. The discovery of host immunogenetic factors also has implications for human evolution in the context of other viral infections",

How wrong he was. The AIDS epidemic, which has so far killed at least 28 million people, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and avian flu epidemics, which have killed considerably fewer, have produced widespread panic across the world [27, 28]. Although attention has been concentrated until now on attacking viral proteins, the study of host immunogenetics represents a new, complex, and revealing side to the host-pathogen equilibrium",
