In this study, 92 diarrheic fecal samples from five farms in four provinces in China were collected and tested for BToV using a RT-PCR assay, and 21.73% samples were found to be BToV positive. Moreover, two complete BToV genome sequences (MN073058 and MN073059) were obtained from the clinical samples, which were 28,297 and 28,301 nucleotides in length, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that the two isolates shared 10 identical amino acid mutations in the S protein compared to the complete S sequences of BToV available in the GenBank database. In addition, seven consecutive amino acid mutations were found from aa 1,486 to 1,492 in the S protein of isolate MN073058. Moreover, the two isolates shared one identical amino acid mutation in the receptor binding sites of the HE protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the epidemic and genomic characterization of BToV in China, which is helpful for further understanding the genetic evolution of BToV.",

BToV mainly causes diarrhea in calves and adult cattle. The virus can not only be detected in feces but also in the respiratory tract, indicating that the virus has dual tissue tropism [6] [7] [8] [9] . BToV has been detected in 16 countries with a wide geographical distribution [2, 7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In addition, a sequence reported to be from goat torovirus is present in the GenBank database, and in 2012, researchers detected the presence of PToV in pig herds by RT-PCR in China [20] .",

The BToV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), membrane glycoprotein (M), hemagglutinin esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid glycoprotein (N) [21] . The S protein is involved in viral infectivity and induces the production of neutralizing antibodies [22] . The M protein plays a role in BToV assembly and nucleocapsid recognition [21] . The HE has a putative F-G-D-S motif and has acetylesterase activity specific for N-acetyl-9-Oacetylneuraminic acid [1, 21] . HE contains three functional domains: a lectin domain (R), an esterase domain (E) and a membrane-proximal domain (MP) [23] . The N protein is the only viral RNA-binding polypeptide found in infected cells. It protects the genome and ensures its timely replication and reliable transmission, as well as playing a role in virus transcription and translation [24, 25] .",

It has been reported that cleavage most likely occurs between amino acids 1,002 and 1,003 of the mature S protein in BToV, resulting in the formation of the S1 and S2 proteins [24] . The two Chinese strains shared two identical amino acid mutations in the signal peptide that might affect its function. It is worth noting that these two strains have six identical amino acid mutations in the putative S1 region. Since the S1 protein is responsible for receptor recognition and neutralizing antibody induction, mutations at amino acids 60 and 96 (T60I, L96P) might affect virus replication [36] .

Moreover, two complete BToV genome sequences were obtained from the clinical samples, and these two BToV isolates had unique amino acid changes in the S and HE proteins. These findings will enhance our understanding of the epidemic and the genetic evolution of BToV.",

Although the number of samples was limited, the study confirmed the presence of BToV in China for the first time, which has significant implications for the diagnosis and control of diarrhea in calves in China.
