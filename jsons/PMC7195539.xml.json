Given the rapid, exponential increase in COVID-19 patients, the prompt construction of temporary Fangcang hospitals was required. Medical personnel at Fangcang hospitals came from all over the country to work shifts lasting between 6 and 8 hours. Fangcang hospitals were usually reconstructed using large-scale spaces such as exhibition halls, gymnasiums and workshops to have the basic functions of medical treatment, logistic support, patient beds and living area. Patients from 7 to 12 February 2020, at Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital in Wuhan, were enrolled in the retrospective study. Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital was managed by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. All individuals with COVID-19 recruited in this study were diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2020081K). Written informed consent was waived by the institutional ethics board of the hospital for emerging infectious diseases, but oral consent was obtained from all the participants. Clinical courses were followed until 22 February.",

In some published studies, incidence of diarrhoea in patients with COVID-19 ranged from 2% to 10% [9,11,14,15]. Our percentage was higher than in those studies, perhaps explained by the use of some drugs such as abidol and moxifloxacin before admission to the Fangcang Hospital. Recent studies found positive SARS-CoV-2-RNA in anal swabs and faecal samples and found that positive results of anal swabs were associated with disease severity [16,17]. Although it was unclear whether there was a definite link between diarrhoea and COVID-19, both studies raise a question concerning whether the gastrointestinal tract might be another site of viral replication, indicating the possibility of faecal\u2013oral transmission.",
