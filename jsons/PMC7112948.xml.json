The IBV genome encodes four major structural proteins, known as the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Spaan et al., 1988, Peng et al., 2006). The spike protein is cleaved into S1 and S2, of which S1 produces neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies and cell attachment determinants have been located to the S1 (Cavanagh et al., 1992). The small envelope protein E, which is mostly embedded within the envelope, has not been reported for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes yet. The amino terminus of the M protein lies outside of the virion particle and is glycosylated, and the N protein is associated with the 27.6 kb genome within the viral particle and plays important roles in the structure and replication of IBV (Collisson et al., 2000, Stern and Sefton, 1982).",

            "text": "Infection with IBV reduces the performance of broilers and egg production (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997), making a severe economic impact on domestic commercial poultry industry. Therefore, considerable efforts on vaccination for preventing IB have been made for over half a century. Traditional treatments against virus infection usually involve inactivated vaccines or live attenuated vaccines (Bijlenga et al., 2004, Tang et al., 2008). However, pitfalls have been found in both of the above types of vaccines: the inactivated vaccines can induce high titers of antibody but usually with lower CTL responses (Ariane et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2004). For IBV, the single involvement of the inactivated vaccines usually results in less than 50% protection in chickens (Cavanagh, 2003); the live attenuated vaccines can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, but with a possibility of spreading the live vaccine virus (Wareing and Tannock, 2001). As an alternative, the development of DNA vaccines has been considered as a possible strategy because of the long lasting expression period, the induction of cellular responses (Woodland, 2004), and safety (Wolff et al., 1990). However, the weak and slow humoral responses induced by DNA vaccines are still a problem (Li et al., 2008). Therefore, developing a more effective vaccination schedule for the practical control of infectious bronchitis (IB) is still required.",

Second, the fragment-based constructions appear to be capable of inducing more potent immune responses than the whole inactivated vaccine, especially for inducing cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) which are critical in the control of poultry IBV infection (Collisson et al., 2000).

It has been reported that CD4+ T-cell responses may produce directly antiviral cytokines as well as increase the proliferation, maturation and functional activity of CD8+CTL, while CD8+CTL plays a critical role in controlling IBV infection in poultry (Collisson et al., 2000). Furthermore, DNA immunization is more effective in eliciting better and potentially longer lasting T-lymphocytes, while B cell immunology suggests that low dose antigen delivery is more effective for eliciting better antibody responses and memory B cells (Bot et al., 1997, Gonzalez and Milstein, 1998). The increased T-lymphocytes in these groups purport that DNA vaccines stimulated intensive cellular immunization, which helps the complete elimination of virus (Letellier et al., 2008, Tian et al., 2008) and provides a more efficient way of protection. The higher antibody titers also suggest that the memory B cells were induced by the primed DNA vaccine.

In this study, this may be attributed to the interaction between vector encoding nucleocapsid protein (pVAX1-N) and the inactivated vaccine. The encoded nucleocapsid protein has been shown to express CTL epitopes in its carboxyl end for MHC molecules to induce CD8+CTL (Boots et al., 1991, Boots et al., 1992, Seo and Collisson, 1997, Seo et al., 1997), while CD8+CTL shows a better efficacy when combined with antibodies in the control of infection (Fang and Luis, 2005). Also, the highly conserved nucleocapsid protein which is the most abundant virus-derived protein produced throughout infection, is not only immunogenic, but also induces cross-reactive antibodies and ultimately protects chickens from viral infection (Seah et al., 2000, Yu et al., 2001). Previous studies have confirmed that immunization with the avian coronavirus nucleocapsid protein applied as a DNA vaccine induced protective immunity provided by CD8+ T cells and possibly by local antibodies (Boots et al., 1992). The challenge assay had also proved that the combining use of a DNA vaccine targeting nucleocapsid protein and the inactivated vaccine is more effective. In contrast, Group 5 did not perform so well in the challenge assay as in the ELISA and neutralizing antibody assays, which might be due to high variation of S1 gene which contributes to poor cross-protection (Cavanagh, 2007).",
