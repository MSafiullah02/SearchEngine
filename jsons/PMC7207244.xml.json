Thirteen ABPD members coded the policies. Each policy was assigned to 2 members who coded independently and reconciled any differences through mutual agreement. With the exception that no members coded policies that they had written or that came from their own institution, assignment was made without reference to the policy's content. Reviewers were blinded to the policy's origins to the extent possible. Two reviewers also independently coded demographic information about the institutions and policies. We obtained information on the institutions from the American Hospital Directory (19). We characterized the location by using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census Regions and\nDivisions of the United States (20) and the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's Data Files (21). Data were collected and managed by using REDCap electronic data capture tools (Supplement 2), which is hosted at Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine (22, 23), and were analyzed by using descriptive statistics.",

In terms of explicitly stated triage criteria, the 5 most commonly mentioned are benefit (25 policies [96.2%]), need (14 [53.8]), age (13 [50.0%]), conservation of resources (10 [38.5%]), and lottery (9 [34.6%]).

Ten (38.4%) policies give preference to health care workers: 5 (19.2%) on the basis of reciprocity (recognition of their voluntary acceptance of risk), 4 (15.4%) on the basis of narrow social utility, 1 (3.8%) on the basis of both reciprocity and narrow social utility, and 2 (7.7%) without articulating a specific reason.

The 2 most common criteria for making allocation decisions are clinical need and benefit, but outside this area of agreement, policies differ widely in the use of other criteria, such as age, conservation of resources, or giving preference to health care workers. Beyond ethical arguments for and against each of these criteria, the variation among policies is itself problematic, because it may result in injustice. For example, if different institutions within the same community use different criteria or prioritize criteria differently, an individual might unknowingly be admitted to a facility with a policy that is unfavorable to him or her. If policies are public, patients might select facilities on the basis of which policy is favorable to them rather than on which policy is fair or ethically sound. State or regional planning for disasters that affect large areas is thus important (5, 6).",
