Of interest, concordance rates for identical twins in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) vary from 15 to 30%, which is similar to the 30-40% concordance rate in type I diabetes, a disease considered to have a clear and strong genetic influence [3]. Since most prevalent rheumatic diseases are not directly associated with specific genes, it is likely that various genes, together with environmental agents, influence the natural course of such disorders.",

However, direct causality relying on Koch\u2019s postulates has been difficult to prove, thereby limiting the association of a specific germ with a disease.

Germs populating \u201copen\u201d body areas such as the skin, oral cavity, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems, as well as \u201cextracellular\u201d and secretory components are collectively called the microbiome, a term that does not encompass multicellular agents that may also be relevant in this context like worms and fungi. Modern biotechnology is based on complex DNA sequencing rather than culture and staining procedures. Although this has greatly improved the identification of germs, it has also added to the complexity of when attempting to understand parasite-host interactions [4,5]. Microbiome issues have attracted the interest of various researchers who have produced excellent articles and reviews on the subject of germs and human interactions. Nonetheless, not much attention has been granted to helminths, which might potentially have a role in this scenario.",

Moreover, water purification, massive vaccination and other sanitary measures provided health benefits to people living in industrialized countries [6]. Still, these apparently healthful \u201ccleaning\u201d strategies could also reduce human microbiota diversity, which could in some way negatively impact one\u2019s health. Likewise, improvement in health care practices can also render adverse events. Recent outbreaks, such as the arboviruses epidemics in Brazil in the last 10 years [7] and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, lead to the immediate incorporation of individual practices aiming at the protection against contamination. Attitudes like avoiding contact with other people and the use of handrails in public transportation, or wearing gloves and masks are deliberately taken in an attempt to prevent infection [8]. While this course of action is understandable during a pandemic, excessive handwashing or showers, avoidance of child contact with unprotected soil, grass, and animals, may compromise the stimulation of the human immune system, thereby jeopardizing the body\u2019s response to infections [6,9]. Although it is still debatable, reduced breastfeeding and increase in caesarean delivery as well as massive vaccination were also shown to have a negative impact on immune development, being associated with increased prevalence of allergic and autoimmune diseases [10]. Following this line of thought, researchers have previously compared the immune system with the central nervous system based on the idea that establishing connections and plasticity are probably vital to the functioning of both systems. Based on this assumption, avoiding contact with germs may result in more vulnerability [11].",

It was recently shown that mice exposed to these oligosaccharides did not develop a type 1 experimental diabetes. That effect was linked to modifications of the intestinal microbiota, leading to an increase in short-chain fatty acid content in the gut. Xiao et al. (2018) used their results to justify the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding in humans. We should consider that oligosaccharides isolated from human milk rather than mouse milk were offered to the animals. Applying that premise to mammalian milk it might well be that cow\u2019s milk could be beneficial to humans, provided that both contain the same type and amount of oligosaccharides [12].",

Inflammatory bowel diseases, e.g. Crohn\u2019s disease, are considered perfect models of the association between changes in dietary habits and less exposure to germs with increased incidence of diseases considered to be immune-mediated. Crohn\u2019s disease is currently more prevalent in wealthy populations living in the Northern Hemisphere, but numbers appear to be increasing in developing countries, possibly due to dietary modification and sanitary improvements [15]. Other immune-mediated diseases including type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), RA, and multiple sclerosis have also been reported to be less prevalent in developing countries [6].",

            "text": "\u201cEverything is autoimmune until proven otherwise\u201d was once said, claiming for a ubiquitous role of autoimmunity in any disease state. Thus, splitting diseases into immune or non-immune-mediated would merely serve didactic purposes [16]. Innate immune mechanisms operate in close association with the adaptive immune responses, modulating the body\u2019s defense against tissue damage caused by a germ, trauma or cancer. This also applies to housekeeping processes such as digestion, breathing, and senescence, which generate by-products that may cause harm to the host. For instance, uric acid released in the event of cell death alerts the immune system, unleashing apoptosis to avoid systemic and potentially harmful inflammation [17]. Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular damage have been associated to changes in the intestinal microbiota. Of interest, studies have linked the processing of phosphatidylcholine in the intestine to increased atherogenesis by producing trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) [18]. Accordingly, modification of the intestinal microbiota by dietary changes, repopulation of the gut flora or administration of probiotics could lead to a marked reduction in plasma and urine TMAO levels, which was associated with a decreased risk of major cardiovascular events [19,20]. Although we may not consider atherosclerosis a bona fide immune-mediated disease, the above-described results indicate that microbiota changes could alter disease course. Limitations of these studies include assessment of TMAO levels systemically as well as evaluation of the microbiota only at the intestinal level. In fact, antibiotics might have altered the microbiota in other sites such as the skin, oral cavity, and respiratory tract, which were not directly evaluated. Although causality is hard to prove, the data reinforces the need to pursue the concept of an association between atherosclerosis and microbiota.",

Considering the huge number of cells linked to immune mediation in the gut, e.g. cell population in Peyer\u2019s patches, modifications of the gut flora definitely impact one\u2019s immune response [5].

            "text": "Issues regarding innate immune mechanisms are receiving more attention, given their importance to the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract. Integrity of the mucosa with a protective layer of mucus, acid pH in the stomach, biliary fluid, maintenance of junctions between epithelial cells as well as presence of antimicrobial secreted peptides, e.g. defensins and cathelicidins, and immunoglobulin A constitutively present in the lumen represent first-line defenses against invaders. Distinguishing \u201cnormal flora\u201d from invading organisms can be made by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) exposed in intestinal epithelial cells, which include toll-like receptors (TLR) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors. Sensing of pathogens or endogenous stimuli released from dying or damaged cells by PRR leads to downstream activation of intracellular signal transduction inflammatory pathways [4,5]. A concerted effort between both innate and adaptive immune responses is then constructed to face damage. It has been proposed that the cost to the immune system progressively increases in a stepwise process resulting from engagement or disruption of successive protective barriers [24]. Simple as it may seem, normal peristalsis contributes to dispatch pathogenic material. During constipation, delayed bowel emptying favors proliferation of germs, and disturbance of vesical bladder clearance leads to recurrent urinary tract infections, particularly in women [25,26]. In developing countries with poor sanitation, recurrent episodes of diarrhea compromise maintenance of a normal flora due to disruption of the gut epithelia, as well as to altered restoration of the normal flora secondary to speedy bowel movements [27]. On the other hand, seniors are more susceptible to constipation. This may further compromise gut flora and favor the development of diverticula, which are potential sites of inflammation [28]. Tissue-resident lymphocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, and Treg cells are present in the intestinal barrier acting to contain the inflammatory insult. Breaches in the gastrointestinal barrier expose immunocompetent cells located in the lamina propria and increase systemic migration of germs or their constituents (antigens) allowing their encounter with professional dendritic antigen-presenting cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, amplifying an inflammatory response that should have been kept locally. In the appropriate unlucky host, bearing a susceptible genotype, the triggering of a complex immune response spreads systemically [4,5,24]. Although unproven, one may speculate that the highly irrigated synovial tissue with fenestrated capillaries and easily accessible immune competent cells, such as type A synoviocytes, are a preferable harbor to those germs or their parts (antigens), where they can foster a sustained immune response.",

Sulphasalazine, which has antibiotic properties, is still an option to treat inflammatory bowel disease and chronic inflammatory arthropathies [29,30]. Minocycline, marketed primarily as an antibiotic, was until recently used as a disease-modifier drug in RA [31]. Methotrexate, a cornerstone in the treatment of RA, as well as leflunomide may have part of their therapeutic benefit linked to changes in the host microbiome [32]. More recently, fexofenadine, a compound to treat chronic allergic diseases, was shown to inhibit tumor necrosis factor activity, revealing an immunomodulatory role to fexofenadine not hitherto described [33]. Chloroquine also has antiviral activity and has just been shown to inhibit in vitro coronavirus replication in concentrations that could be achieved in clinical practice [34]. Of interest, the recent worldwide arbovirus Chikungunya outbreak has been associated with joint manifestations, which could derive from a direct viral activity or the triggering of existing subclinical inflammation in the joints [35]. In addition, other viruses like Epstein-Barr and parvovirus B19 have long been associated with the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. Hence, the recent proposed antiviral chloroquine activity could well be an additional mechanism to explain its effective response to treat various rheumatic diseases, including the ability to ameliorate musculoskeletal manifestations following Chikungunya infection [36].",

Periodontitis has been shown to have a major role in the pathogenesis of RA. However, recent epidemiological data may question periodontitis relevance in RA pathogenesis. Using modelling to extrapolate collected data, both the prevalence and burden of RA were reported to be higher in high-income populations where oral hygiene is presumably better [37]. Edentulation is highly prevalent among low-income Brazilians and chronic periodontitis is the major cause of tooth loss during adulthood [38]. Yet, RA burden was shown to be milder in Brazil and other low-income areas of the globe, as compared to wealthy regions. Also, we have reported very low Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) scoring, meaning a favorable outcome, among low-income juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients living in one of the less developed areas in Brazil. Indeed, it is surprising that the CHAQ scores were lower than those collected among JIA patients evaluated in the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) and Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) registries that gather data from high-income populations, with presumably better sanitation and oral hygiene. Although it may just be coincidental, there is a high prevalence of helminthiasis in our low-income population leading us to speculate whether helminths or their products down-modulate inflammation in autoimmune diseases, thus decreasing severity [39] (Figure 1\n).",

In addition, innate immune mechanisms, including tight junctions between cells, pigmentation, hair follicles, sweat and sebaceous material prevent access to cells located in the dermis.

That tolerance could be broken during infections, triggering the proliferation of CD4+ T cells both to the invading pathogen as well as to commensals, developing memory cells to the new infecting agent. In a specific host that equilibrium could be lost leading to unresolving inflammation like that occurring in Crohn\u00b4s disease [40]. Similar mechanisms could be the reason for the occurrence of gastrointestinal manifestations in SpA. A recent report has shown that skin-resident T lymphocytes constitutively expressing interleukin (IL)-17A coexist with commensals, contributing to tissue integrity. Harmful stimuli represented by trauma, infection or insect bite brake barriers, promoting cell plasticity so that the cytokine repertoire is now enriched with IL-5 and IL-13, leading to prolonged inflammation. Therefore, skin barriers help maintain homeostasis by avoiding contact of stimuli to professional cells of the immune system [41]. Once a certain stimulus, in a susceptible host, surpasses that initial defense, systemic inflammation is unleashed, provoking non-resolving autoinflammatory or autoimmune diseases, whether affecting mainly innate or adaptive immune responses, respectively.",

However, we have to bear in mind that more accurate data were collected in developing regions. Thus, despite some discussion, research suggests RA is less prevalent and/or less severe among low-income populations.

Helminthiasis are still highly prevalent in the Northeast of Brazil and, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, it is current practice to prescribe prophylactic anti-helminthics to decrease the burden of parasite infections and helminths\u2019 infestations (https://extranet.who.int/rhl/topics/preconception-pregnancy-childbirth-and-postpartum-care/antenatal-care/who-recommendation-preventive-anthelminthic-treatment; downloaded in Feb 15, 2020). Helminths have for a long time been considered relevant modulators of the immune response [45]. There are reports on the benefit of the administration of Thichuris suis eggs to treat patients with Crohn\u2019s disease [46]. Our group has shown that animals subjected to collagen-induced arthritis and treated with a crude Ascaris suum extract have decreased inflammation with reduction of cytokine release into the inflamed joints [47]. We then identified the gene sequence of a peptide from the A. suum extract present in the celomic fluid of that worm, which shows anti-inflammatory activity in mice subjected to AIA. Intramuscular administration of a plasmid with the correspondent gene sequence decreased inflammation in AIA mice, apparently through a shift of the macrophage population into an M2 phenotype (unpublished data). It is worth mentioning that oral administration of A. suum extract, rather than viable worms as with T. suis experiments, was effective, providing a proof-of-concept to support the idea that helminthic products released into the bowel modulate the inflammatory response [47]. It has also been previously shown that an excretory-secretory product of Acantocheilonema vitae has an immunomodulatory role, being able to decrease osteoclast-mediated bone resorption via modification of the gut microbiota [48]. Helminths or their products might have beneficial and harmful effects to the host. Difficulties in establishing a net result should not prevent efforts to dissect those mechanisms, both to understand the pathophysiology of immune-mediated diseases as well as to develop therapeutic alternatives (Figure 2\n) [49,50].",

This could be explained by the findings of G\u00e9rard (2010) that showed only ocular serovar group Chlamydiae in synovial biopsies from arthritis patients, who were PCR-positive for C. trachomatis DNA in that tissue and not genital serovar. This could mean that the composition of the initial inoculum influences the probability of arthritis development [65]. These data, if confirmed, could be relevant when thinking about a way to monitor which patients will go on to develop or have a greater risk of developing arthritis. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these findings were based on the evaluation of only four patients [65]. Similarly, C. pneumoniae has also been accepted as an etiologic agent for inflammatory arthritis [66,67]. Earlier, it was believed that antibiotic treatment of patients with Chlamydia-induced arthritis was ineffective [59,61,63,68], but recent studies indicate antibiotic therapy might be beneficial [56,69]. However, this efficacy is not complete as the proposed treatment (6 months of oral antibiotic therapy with either doxycycline or azithromycin, both combined with rifampin) improves joint symptoms in 63% of patients and leads to remission in 22% [51], indicating other mechanisms might be involved in the development of arthritis which, if better understood, could lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets [54,59].",

As for the other SpAs, which comprise the majority of the diseases in this group, with ReA accounting for less than 2% of the overall disease burden [70], the role of infection (whether there is a role or what that role is) is not as well established. Nonetheless, there has also been some evidence regarding this matter [51,59,71,72] \u2013 various authors have discussed the role of Chlamydia, not only in ReA but also in undifferentiated SpA[71]. Rashid et al. (2016) reported a link between elevated levels of Klebsiella antibodies and AS in various geographical locations [73], and the development of this disease appears to be related to the presence of K. pneumoniae aerogenes in the gastrointestinal tract [58].",

There are several theories that attempt to define how exactly HLA-B27 predisposes to SpA and how it is implicated in its pathogenesis [56,75]. This is of particular relevance in the context of the arthritogenic peptide hypothesis, according to which microbial peptides mimic certain self-peptides. Specifically, HLA-B27 may have structural features that are shared with bacteria, causing reactivity of HLA-B27-specific, CD8+ bearing cytotoxic T lymphocytes, leading to autoimmunity and tissue damage and inflammation [58,76]. Zhang et al. (2018) stated that AS seems to be related to K. pneumoniae infection in HLA-B27 positive patients, based on consistent findings of raised anti-K. pneumoniae antibodies and the presence of molecular mimicry between the HLA-B27 molecule and bacterial antigens [58].",
