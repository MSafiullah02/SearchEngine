The cleaved protein fused the viral envelop to the host cell membrane, inducing the viral gene to enter the host cell. Subsequent reports demonstrated that trypsin and other host proteases, by cleaving the surface glycoproteins important for membrane fusion, contribute to the spread of infection and the pathogenicity of many types of viruses, including paramyxoviruses and influenza virus [15], [16]. Serine proteases, such as trypsin, transmembrane protease serine S1 member (TMPRSS) 2 and human trypsin-like protease (HAT; also known as TMPRSS11D) are important examples of host proteases responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), which is essential for viral gene entry into the cell and the start of viral replication [17], [18].",

Hosoya et al. [20] compared the antiviral activity of protease inhibitors, including camostat, sivelestat and gabexate, using the 50% effective concentration unified in \u03bcg/mL in an in vitro study using MDCK cells. Furthermore, the maximal plasma concentration of FOY-251 (a metabolite of camostat) was also reported in ng/mL [33]. Therefore, to compare the effects of protease inhibitors in our study with those of other reports, we unified the concentration in \u03bcg/mL. The concentrations of the protease inhibitors used in the present study were similar (approximately 20 \u03bcM) because, at 10 \u03bcg/mL, the molarities of camostat, sivelestat and gabexate are 20 \u03bcM, 19 \u03bcM and 24 \u03bcM, respectively, and 1000 KIU/mL of aprotinin is 19 \u03bcM. Cells were pretreated with culture medium (DF-12 medium supplemented with 2% USG) containing one of the serine protease inhibitors or the vehicle (1% water) for 30 min unless otherwise stated.

Other types of serine protease inhibitors, including gabexate and aprotinin, also reduced the viral titers and RNA levels in the cells, and sivelestat reduced viral RNA levels. Camostat reduced the cleavage of an influenza virus precursor protein, HA0, into the subunit HA1. The cells expressed TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D (= HAT) protein at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, as well as mRNAs for TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D. These findings suggest that serine protease inhibitors may inhibit the replication of influenza virus in HTE cells through the inhibition of HA cleavage by host proteases. Camostat and aprotinin also reduced the concentrations of the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the supernatants. Among the protease inhibitors studied, camostat may be the most potent inhibitor of influenza virus replication and inflammatory cytokine production during viral replication.",

            "text": "The potency of camostat and gabexate as inhibitors of influenza virus replication in the primary cultures of HTE cells that we observed was more than 100 times greater than that observed in MDCK cells by Hosoya et al. [20]. Coote et al [39]. showed that camostat inhibits sodium channel function in human bronchial epithelial cells and we showed that, at the similar concentration (15 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL, respectively), influenza virus replication in HTE cells was inhibited. The precise reasons for the different potency of the inhibitory effects among the cell types are uncertain, but the greater expression levels of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D in tracheal epithelial cells [35], [36] compared to MDCK cells [53] might be responsible. Similarly, Zhirnov et al. [22] demonstrated that 140 \u03bcM (= 60 \u03bcg/mL) leupeptin, a serine protease inhibitor, reduced influenza virus infection in human adenoid epithelial cells, while Hosoya et al. [20] reported that 500 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin did not inhibit the virus infection in MDCK cells. The concentrations of protease inhibitors required to inhibit influenza virus infection may differ among different types of epithelial cells.",

In the present study, the titers of the A/H1N1 pdm 2009 and the A/H3N2 influenza viruses in the supernatants were reduced by camostat at the concentrations of 10 ng/mL and above.

The entire supernatant volume (1 mL) was collected 5 days (120 h) after infection. We did not measure the final concentration of camostat. However, we added fresh medium containing camostat at two different time points (24 h, 72 h), and cells were incubated in a humidified incubator. We found that the medium volume did not change significantly after 120 h of infection. Therefore, the addition of fresh camostat in the medium would maintain the final concentration of camostat at 10 \u03bcg/mL.
