Communication during the events was difficult because not only did local, state, and federal health officials have to be kept informed, but also all case investigations had to be coordinated with agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who had their own independent legal authorities. The attacks emphasised national vulnerability to the use of weapons of mass destruction and made public health a new subject of security discussions. This emphasis led to the emergence of health security as a new legislative focus as Congress recognised the need to expand the resiliency of the public health system to respond to national security threats. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) of 2006 was passed, specifically including health security. PAHPA broadened the previous focus on bioterrorism to a more comprehensive, all-hazards approach that acknowledged the growing concern of emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases and natural disasters, in addition to intentional threats from chemical, nuclear, or radiological incidents. In turn, the US Department of Health and Human Services released its National Health Security Strategy.",

These investments were made largely in response to a growing awareness of the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases and to reports of an extensive Soviet bioweapons programme.3, 4 New funding resources for infectious diseases led to improvements in epidemiological capacity at the state and local levels, a core national stockpile of medical assets, and a novel laboratory diagnostic network for bioterrorism agents. Since 9/11, the US public health system has received unprecedented national investment in recognition of its importance to the national security. These investments have resulted in increased capacity that is most evident in well populated states and large urban areas where new resources were mostly directed. The terrorist attacks also led to a cultural shift in the way state and large city health departments work and interact with other agencies and sectors. Health departments are now becoming increasingly accepted as equal partners by traditional first responders, such as law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and emergency medical services. These interactions are supported by the incorporation of public health components into the National Response Framework and the National Incident Management System. Public health bodies at the local, state, and federal levels now routinely use this system to ensure that everyone has the same focus, whether responding to daily incidents or major disasters.",

The National Disaster Medical System expanded its mission to include medical treatment for victims of terrorist attacks.

The Stockpile also started the forward placement of lifesaving antidotes for terrorist attacks with chemical or nerve agents (the CHEMPACK programme5). The mission of the Laboratory Response Network has expanded from biological and chemical agents to include emerging infectious diseases and other public health threats and emergencies, and from US borders to international partnerships with Mexico, Canada, the UK, and others. After 9/11, the US Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act of 20016 and the Bioterrorism Act of 2002,7 which substantially strengthened the ability of the USA to oversee select agents and toxins that could pose public health threats. A recent Presidential Executive Order8 stipulated that the list of select agents will be adjusted to focus on agents of greatest concern. Several US Government programmes (eg, CDC's Global Disease Detection, Department of Defense's Biological Threat Reduction Program, Department of State's Global Threat Reduction Programs, and USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats Program) have also been involved in enhancing worldwide capacity to rapidly detect and contain emerging health (and bioterror) threats. These programmes increasingly focus on the development of local health capacity to support WHO's revised international health regulations in conjunction with other worldwide and native efforts directed at epidemic preparedness and response.9\n",

For example, 48 of 50 states (96%) have shown their ability to activate staff and their emergency operations centres. Similarly, the medical response to a public health emergency has been strengthened.14 Progress in preparedness made in the past decade (panel 1\n) has benefited routine and large-scale or unexpected responses, therefore saving lives and preventing illness and injuries.15 Annual investments through CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness cooperative agreement with states support crucial everyday systems. These investments support more than 5000 front-line public health workers who routinely assist local and regional responses for incidents 24 h per day 7 days per week, such as outbreaks of foodborne and infectious diseases, and regional environmental disasters, such as wildfires, floods, and ice storms.Panel 1Progress in public health preparedness, 1999\u20132011\nThen\n\n\u2022Before 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not fund states for public health preparedness.\u2022Before 1999, no national stockpile of medical supplies was available for use in emergencies.

Within 2 weeks of a novel virus being identified and confirmed, CDC validated a new PCR assay for rapid definitive laboratory diagnosis, manufactured new diagnostic kits, and began distributing them to partner laboratories in the USA and abroad in support of WHO. This response not only led to rapid selection and development of the vaccine strain, which is still used, but also confirmed early cases in field investigations for rapid characterisation of the geographical spread of the virus, and the patient groups at highest risk of illness complications. Additionally, about 90% of member laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network were mobilised for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (including key partner laboratories in the Department of Defense), and CDC's Strategic National Stockpile deployed 25% of its antiviral drugs and personal protective equipment within planned timelines.",

In April 2009, Epi-X reported cases of acute respiratory illness in Veracruz, Mexico, an outbreak that was identified as a novel form of influenza A (H1N1). CDC's Health Alert Network (HAN) is another important system of communication for sending messages to health professionals and the public (including media).

Large-scale and unpredictable natural, accidental, or intentionally caused disease outbreaks and environmental disasters need many of the same routine surveillance, laboratory, risk communication, and other core public health systems. The flexibility of the Laboratory Response Network shown during the anthrax attacks, for example, has also played a key part in validating BioWatch results, and for responses ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), monkeypox, West Nile virus, and H5N1, to investigations for ricin and saxitoxin poisonings and numerous exposures to mercury. Individuals, families, and communities are also essential partners in building resilience to public health hazards. Development of informed empowered individuals and communities (a cornerstone of the whole-of-nation policy approach16) demands new actions and investment in many sectors to transform the populace from victims to potential responders. Prepared communities understand potential risks and their roles before, during, and after an adverse incident. These communities also have members who are engaged in local decision making, are prepared to take action during an incident, and are committed to their personal preparedness to protect their own health and that of their neighbours until help arrives. A continued public health focus on development of healthy communities can also have ancillary benefits to improve preparedness because healthy people are more resilient to health threats.",

Of increased concern are natural emerging infectious diseases caused by novel zoonotic pathogens with pandemic potential like SARS, or known pathogens, such as another pandemic influenza virus. A main driver for this convergence is the volume and speed of human travel across the world, which provides infectious agents with unprecedented opportunities for broad geographical reach and new populations of human and animal hosts. Furthermore, technological barriers are continually being overcome for development of modified versions of microbes with new or enhanced virulence traits or even completely new life forms, which can all inflict great harm. The genomes of thousands of microbes have been sequenced and their blueprints are available for rapid sharing across the internet along with instructions for development of chemical agents. These and other types of advanced technologies are becoming increasingly accessible and easy to use by less-skilled individuals. In 2009, President Obama signed an Executive Order17 to bridge gaps in the ability of the USA to respond rapidly to a biological attack, and CDC has created an Anthrax Management Team to develop guidelines for preparing for and responding to this threat. In view of its unique biochemical properties and clinical effects, anthrax is the most concerning biological agent to the USA.",

A 2009 survey19 found that only 37 state epidemiologists reported substantial-to-full capacity for bioterrorism emergency response\u2014a 10% decline since the peak of federal funding in 2004. Similarly, advances in laboratory reporting are tempered by the reality that in 2010, 12 (24%) states could not submit 90% of Escherichia coli test results to CDC's PulseNet database within 4 working days, compromising rapid identification of outbreaks and subsequent recalls.12 States cannot adequately meet everyday needs, let alone increased efforts for emergency incidents that have potential national implications, without reliable, dedicated, or sustained federal funding.

For the first time, in spring 2011, CDC released national standards11 for preparedness to guide state and local health departments in assessing needs, building 15 capabilities, measuring outcomes, and directing preparedness funds to priority areas.",
