            "text": "When we started the Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) Project [44] in 2014, we thought that it should not be difficult to create a collection of 25 multiple choice questions (MCQs) that assess student understanding of core cybersecurity concepts. Six years later, in the middle of validating the two draft assessments we have produced, we now have a much greater appreciation for the significant difficulty of creating and validating effective and well-adopted concept inventories. This paper highlights and reflects on critical steps in our journey, with the hope that our experiences can provide useful lessons learned to anyone who wishes to create a cybersecurity concept inventory, any assessment in cybersecurity, or any assessment in STEM. 4 Cybersecurity is a vital area of growing importance for national competitiveness, and there is a significant need for cybersecurity professionals [4] . The number of cybersecurity programs at colleges, universities, and training centers is increasing. As educators wrestle with this demand, there is a corresponding awareness that we lack a rigorous research base that informs how to prepare cybersecurity professionals. Existing certification exams, such as CISSP [9] , are largely informational, not conceptual. We are not aware of any scientific analysis of any of these exams. Validated assessment tools are essential so that cybersecurity educators have trusted methods for discerning whether efforts to improve student preparation are successful [32] . The CATS Project provides rigorous evidence-based instruments for assessing and evaluating educational practices; in particular, they will help assess approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity such as traditional lecture, case study, hands-on lab exercises, interactive simulation, competition, and gaming.",

Following [13] , we then carried out qualitative interviews [40, 45] to develop a cognitive theory that can guide the construction of assessment questions. Based on these interviews, we have developed a preliminary battery of over 30 test items for each assessment. Each test item measures how well students understand core concepts as identified by our Delphi studies. The distractors (incorrect answers) for each test item are based in part on student misconceptions observed during the interviews. We are now validating the CCI and CCA using small-scale pilot testing, cognitive interviews, expert review, and large-scale psychometric testing [31] .",

We started with 36 experts in total, 33 for CCI, 31 for CCA, and 29 in both. We communicated with the experts via email and SurveyMonkey.

Many of the experts came with strongly held opinions to include their favorite topics, such as policy, forensics, malware analysis, and economic and legal aspects. We completed the two Delphi processes in parallel in fall 2014, taking about eight weeks, conducting initial topic identification followed by three rounds of topic ratings.

Sometimes we would create a scenario specifically intended to target a specific concept (e.g., identify the attacker) or topic (e.g., cyberphysical system).",

Some students demonstrated lack of adversarial thinking in suggesting that Bob should simply e-mail the information to Alice, reflecting lack of awareness of potential threats, such as someone impersonating Alice or eavesdropping on the e-mail. Similarly, others recognized the Switchbox. A company has two internal Local Area Networks (LANs): a core LAN connected to an email server and the Internet, and an accounting LAN connected to the corporate accounting server (which is not connected to the Internet). Each desktop computer has one network interface card. Some computers are connected to only one of the networks (e.g., Computers A and C). A computer that requires access to both LANs (e.g., Computer B) is connected to a switchbox with a toggle switch that physically connects the computer to exactly one LAN at a time. need to authenticate Alice, but still recommended e-mailing the information without encryption after authenticating Alice.

In comparison with most CCI scenarios, CCA scenarios with artifacts require students to reason about more complex real-world challenges in context with specific technical details, including ones from the artifact. For example, inspired by a network encountered by one of our team members, the CCA switchbox scenario ( Figure 1 ) describes a corporate network with switchbox. We present this scenario using prose and a system diagram and use it to target the concept of identifying security goals. As revealed in our cognitive interviews, these artifacts inspired and challenged students to apply concepts to complex situations.

One way is to have students from the targeted population answer stems without being offered any alternatives. By construction, popular incorrect answers are distractors that some subjects will find attractive. This method has the advantage of using a specific actual stem.

In cybersecurity, issues are frequently subtle, and the best answer often hinges on the details and adversarial model. It is important to provide enough details (but not too many), and doing so is challenging within the constraints of a MCQ. Second, it is often difficult to ensure that there is exactly one best answer. For example, typically there are many potential designs and vulnerabilities. An \"ideal\" answer, if it existed, might appear too obvious. To deal with this difficulty, we usually add details to the scenario and stem; we emphasize that the task is to select the best alternative (which might not be a perfect answer) from the available choices; and we sometimes frame the question in terms of comparing alternatives (e.g., best or worst). Third, it is problematic to create MCQs questions based on attractive open-ended questions, such as, \"Discuss potential vulnerabilities of this system.\" Often it can be much more challenging to think of a vulnerability than to recognize it when stated as an alternative. Listing a clever vulnerability or attack as an answer choice can spoil an otherwise beautiful question. Again, to deal with this difficulty, it can be helpful to ask students to compare alternatives. These difficulties are common to other domains (e.g., engineering design), and they are strongly present in cybersecurity.",

Our strategy was to put most of the details into the scenario-rather than into the stem-so that the stem could be as short and straightforward as reasonably possible. This strategy worked well. We created an initial set of twelve scenarios for our talk-aloud interviews to uncover student misconceptions [45] .

Although several of our test items share a common scenario, unexpectedly we found it problematic to do so for many scenarios. The reason is that, for each stem, we felt the need to add many details to the scenario to ensure that there would be exactly one best answer, and such details were often specific to the stem.

For this reason, we examined all responses. Figure 8 includes two examples, t * for initial version (0.7%) and t * for final version (1.2%), of interesting unpopular responses. Also, the alternatives should satisfy various constraints, including being non-overlapping (see Section 3.7), so one should not simply automatically choose the four most popular distractors.",

It is striking how strongly the workers prefer Distractor E over the correct choice A. Perhaps the workers, who do not know network security, find Distractor E the most understandable and logical choice. Also, its broad wording may be appealing. In Section 3.7, we explain how we reworded Distractor E to ensure that Alternative A is now unarguably better than E. Figure 6 shows the popularity of worker-generated responses to the stem, when workers were not given any alternatives. After making Figure 6 , we realized it contains a mistake: responses t2 (initial version) and t1 (final version) are correct answers, which should have been matched and grouped with Alternative A. We nevertheless include this figure because it is informative. Especially for the initial version of the stem, it is notable how more popular the two worker-generated distractors t2 (initial version) and t1 (final version) are than our distractors. This finding is not unexpected, because, in the final version, we had intentionally chosen Alternative A over t1, to make the correct answer less obvious (see Section 3.7). These data support our belief that subjects would find t1 more popular than Alternative A. Figure 7 is the corrected version of Figure 6 , with responses t2 (initial version) and t1 (final version) grouped with the correct answer A. Although new distractor t1 (initial version) was very popular, its broad nebulous form makes it unlikely to contribute useful information about student conceptual understanding. For the first version of the stem, we identified seven equivalency classes of new distractors (excluding the new alternate correct answers); for the final version we identified 12.",

(2) We had virtually no control over the selection of workers, and almost all of them seemed ill-suited for the task (did not answer Question 1 correctly). Nevertheless, several of the open-ended responses reflected a thoughtful understanding of the scenario. (3) Tasks 3-4 did produce distractors (new and old) of note for the worker population, thereby illustrating the potential of using crowdsourcing to generate distractors, if the selected population could be adequately controlled.
