            "text": "The ER is an important cellular organelle that controls several critical aspects of cellular processes such as cellular proteins folding and post-translational modifications. It also plays pivotal roles in viral infection processes. As intracellular parasites, viruses must utilize the ER to complete some of their life cycles including virus entry, viral protein synthesis and modifications, genome replication and virus assembly (He, 2006; Inoue & Tsai, 2013). During productive viral infection, viruses hijack the host translation apparatus to produce a large amount of viral proteins accumulated in the ER lumen. Some viruses even utilize the ER as their replication sites such as Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Moradpour et al., 2007) and African swine fever virus (ASFV) (Galindo et al., 2012). These activities of alien pathogens may disrupt the homeostasis of the ER and lead to a rapid accumulation of malfolded and unfolded proteins inside the ER lumen. Consequently, cells face great challenges and stress, so called ER stress, which may cause a wide variety of prevalent diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, renal disease, liver disease and cancer (Hetz, 2012). To alleviate the detrimental effects of ER stress, cells evolved an ER-to-nucleus signaling pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), which functions to restore the ER homeostasis (Bernales et al., 2006; Schroder & Kaufman, 2005). However, if under unsolved or intense ER stress, cells would fail to regain the ER homeostasis and instead, initiate the intrinsic apoptotic cascades, which have been thought to primarily associate with virus pathogenesis (Galluzzi et al., 2008). Here, we give a comprehensive description about the dynamic relationship between ER stress and virus infection with emphasis on how UPR and apoptosis influence viral replication and pathogenesis as well as the strategies employed by viruses to cope with ER stress. In particular, we discuss the current developed ER stress-related antivirals including broad-spectrum therapy by targeting ER stress signaling pathways and specifically targeted antiviral therapy by disturbing the functions of ER stress-triggering viral proteins.",

When it senses ER stress, PERK undergoes oligomerization and autophosphorylation to form active PERK, which then phosphorylates the \u03b1 subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 (eIF2\u03b1) to reduce global protein synthesis and thus relieve the ER stress (Harding et al., 2000). However, this limited amount of active eIF2\u03b1 selectively increases the translation of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), a pro-survival transcription factor that facilitates cell survival through activating genes involved in amino acids biosynthesis and transport, stress response, redox reactions and protein secretion (Harding et al., 2000). One target gene of ATF4 is growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 34 (GADD34), a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit that recruits PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 and derepresses PERK-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation attenuation, thereby constituting a negative feedback loop in the UPR (Novoa et al., 2001).",

When IRE1 dissociates from GRP78, it undergoes oligomerization, which in turn activates its kinase and endonuclease activities. Activated IRE1 removes a 26-nucleotide intron from X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA to form a spliced XBP1 (XBP1(s)), which is subsequently translated into a basic-zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that activates the transcription of genes that enhance the ER protein-folding capacity, phospholipid biosynthesis and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (Lee et al., 2003; Shaffer et al., 2004). XBP1(s) is also able to activate the HSP40 family member P58IPK, which can bind PERK and inhibit its activity to phoshporylate eIF2\u03b1 (Yan et al., 2002). IRE1, by itself, can degrade ER-bound mRNAs through the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway to reduce protein translation and limit unfolded protein load in the ER lumen (Hollien et al., 2009).",

In response to ER stress, ATF6 is packaged in ER-derived transport vesicles and translocates into the Golgi complex, where two specific proteases cleave its transmembrane domain and liberate its active N-terminal DNA binding domain, ATF6 (N) (Ye et al., 2000). ATF6 (N) then translocates into the nucleus and activates genes that improve the ER folding capacity such as ER chaperones, protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) as well as XBP1 (Yoshida et al., 2001). Overall, these three branches function to remedy ER stress by reducing the flux of newly synthesized polypeptides into the ER, degrading ER-localized proteins and expanding the ER folding capacity.",

            "text": "Emerging evidence indicates that a large number of viruses are capable of eliciting ER stress during their infection, which is summarized in Table 1. Currently, 35 animal and 1 plant viruses, which belong to 18 virus families with the majority being RNA viruses, have been reported to trigger ER stress indicators including inducing ER chaperones and activating three UPR sensors. 19 viruses have been reported to induce the expression of ER chaperone proteins (Bip, GRP78, GRP94, calnexin, calreticulin), which might be caused by accumulation of malfolded and unfolded viral proteins inside the ER lumen. These viruses include Potato virus X (PVX), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), ASFV, Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), Tula virus (TULV), Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis E virus (HEV), Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Canine distemper virus (CDV), Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Simian virus 5 (SV5), Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Moloney murine leukemia virus-TB (MoMuLV), and Neurovirulent mouse retrovirus (FrCasE) (Table 1). Intriguingly, upon virus-triggered ER stress, the three UPR transmembrane sensors are differentially activated: 19, 17 and 14 viruses have been reported to activate the PERK-eIF2\u03b1, IRE1-XBP1 and ATF6 branches, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 1), implying that cells prefer to initiate the PERK-eIF2\u03b1 pathway in response to virus infection, presumably because the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-mediated global translational attenuation can efficiently restrict virus replication by preventing the synthesis of viral and cellular proteins crucial for virus life cycle (Baltzis et al., 2004; Pena & Harris, 2011). Nonetheless, it should be noted that at least two other eIF2\u03b1 kinases, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2) could be activated upon virus infection to restrict virus replication by preventing protein translation (Berlanga et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2007). Hence, the role of PERK in translational attenuation could change depending on the virus.\n\n",

            "text": "Four pieces of information could be inferred from these published data about the characteristics of ER stress-triggering viruses and viral proteins, which could be useful in predicting the outcome of virus infection and unveiling the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. First, ER stress-triggering viruses are usually those have cytopathogenic or virulence effects. For the same type of viruses, the avirulent strain triggers no or mild ER stress such as the nonvirulent mouse retrovirus F43 (Dimcheff et al., 2004), noncytopathic mild Dugbe virus (DUGV) (Rodrigues et al., 2012), and the attenuated HSV-1 strain KOS (Mao et al., 2001), suggesting that ER stress is associated with viral virulence and pathogenesis. One exception is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) lacking the envelope (E) gene, which is attenuated in vivo but elicits higher UPR than SARS-CoV with E gene (DeDiego et al., 2011). Second, the ER-tropic viruses that exploit the host ER as an integral part of their life cycle are prone to trigger ER stress, such as Flaviviridae viruses (HCV, BVDV and JEV), Asfarviridae virus ASFV, and Coronaviridae viruses, which use the ER as the primary site of glycoprotein biosynthesis, genome replication and even particle assembly (de Haan & Rottier, 2005; Galindo et al., 2012; Knoops et al., 2008; Leyssen et al., 2000; Oostra et al., 2007). Third, viruses that modify the ER in order to create a compartment suitable for virus replication are also inclined to induce the ER stress. For example, DENV, VZV and JEV have been shown to stimulate ER proliferation and HCV has been reported to alter the ER structure (Carpenter et al., 2011; Hase et al., 1992; Moradpour et al., 2007; Umareddy et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2006). Fourth, the viral proteins that are synthesized, processed or located in the ER tend to trigger the ER stress, including PXV TGBp3, PEDV (E, N), the glycoproteins of viruses (SFV, LCMV, TULV, BVDV, DENV, JEV, VZV, SV5, HSV-1 and VSV) and ER-membrane-anchored or transmembrane proteins (SARS-CoV (3a, 8ab), HCV (NS4B, E2)) (Table 1). Although the precise mechanism remains elusive for most viral proteins, certain viral proteins could trigger ER stress via their interactions with ER chaperone GRP78 such as HCV E2 (Choukhi et al., 1998), VSV G (Machamer et al., 1990), DENV E (Limjindaporn et al., 2009), and SV5 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein protein (Watowich et al., 1991).",

            "text": "As viruses that modify or alter the ER tend to induce ER stress, we predict the following viruses might trigger ER stress and activate related signaling pathways. The Picornaviridae family virus Poliovirus, Poxviridae DNA virus vaccinia virus (VV), Comoviridae family virus Grapevine fanleaf nepovirus (GFLV) and Bromoviridae family virus Brome mosaic virus (BMV) as their infection can cause extensive cytopathic modifications to host ER and/or induce ER-derived virus vesicles (Bamunusinghe et al., 2011; Ritzenthaler et al., 2002; Suhy et al., 2000; Tolonen et al., 2001). Since viral proteins that are synthesized, processed or located in the ER tend to induce the ER stress, Yellow fever virus (YFV) envelope proteins, pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), might trigger the ER stress as these proteins accumulate in the ER (Ciczora et al., 2010). Based on the fact that some viral proteins can trigger ER stress through interacting with ER chaperones, the Togaviridae family virus Rubella virus (RV) glycoproteins E1 and E2 might trigger ER stress as these two proteins interact with ER chaperones calreticulin and calnexin (Nakhasi et al., 2001). Moreover, our assumptions could provide possible activating mechanisms for those experimentally validated ER stress-triggering viruses. For example, as the ER stress-triggering virus, CVB3 has been reported to modify the ER membrane permeability (van Kuppeveld et al., 1997), it is highly likely that this activity could be responsible for CVB3-induced ER stress. Given the facts that certain viral proteins trigger ER stress via their interactions with ER chaperone GRP78 and that the ER stress inducer, HEV ORF2 has been shown to interact with GRP78 (Yu et al., 2011), it is possible that this interaction could activate ER stress. Further efforts are required to examine these possibilities.",

            "text": "The UPR has three major consequences to mitigate ER stress: attenuating global protein translation, degrading ER-localized proteins and expanding the ER folding capacity, some of which are beneficial to viral replication. For example, the ATF6-induced expression of chaperone proteins may help viral proteins folding and prevent protein aggregation. The PERK-eIF2\u03b1-activated ATF4 may help re-establish cell metabolism and resume protein translation. The IRE1-XBP1 pathway might facilitate virus replication by enhancing ER protein-folding ability and ER membrane biosynthesis (Ron & Hampton, 2004). In fact, activated ATF6 has been reported to promote the replication of ASFV (Galindo et al., 2012) and Lymphocytic choromeningitis virus (LCMV) (Pasqual et al., 2011); GRP78 facilitates the replication of DENV (Limjindaporn et al., 2009), HCMV (Buchkovich et al., 2008), JEV (Wu et al., 2011) and RGNNV (Su et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010) and activated ATF4 facilitates HIV replication (Caselli et al., 2012). The IRE1-XBP1 pathway has been activated by IAV to facilitate its own replication (Hassan et al., 2012). However, other UPR outcomes are detrimental for virus replication. The PERK-eIF2\u03b1-mediated global translation attenuation is known as an antiviral response to restrict the replication of WNV (Ambrose & Mackenzie, 2011), DENV (Pena & Harris, 2011) and VSV (Baltzis et al., 2004). The IRE1-XBP1(s)-mediated ERAD pathway reduces intracellular HBV particles by degrading its envelope proteins (Lazar et al., 2012). In addition, the IRE1-XBP1 pathway inhibits the replication of Sindbis virus (SINV) and DENV through an unknown mechanism (Pena & Harris, 2011; Perry et al., 2012). To survive and propagate in host cells, viruses have evolved specific mechanisms to modulate the UPR (Figure 1).",

These viruses contain a specialized internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that can efficiently recruit and assemble the initiation ribosome complex (Robert et al., 2006; Ventoso et al., 2006). Besides, some viruses have developed additional \u201csmart\u201d strategies to circumvent PERK-eIF2\u03b1-mediated inhibitory effects and reset the cellular translational program for their own purposes (Table 1 and Figure 1). One salient strategy is to reduce the phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 by activating eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase PP1 and inducing its regulatory subunit GADD34. The HSV-1 \u03b3134.5, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigens (EBNA 2) and ASFV DP71L proteins are GADD34 homologs that interact with PP1 and recruit its activity against eIF2\u03b1 (He, 2006; Rivera et al., 2007); while viruses like CHIKV, ASFV, RRV, DENV, HCV, Influenza A virus (IAV) and WNV activate the expression of GADD34 (Galindo et al., 2012; Hassan et al., 2012; Medigeshi et al., 2007; Merquiol et al., 2011; Pena & Harris, 2011; Rathore et al., 2013; Trujillo-Alonso et al., 2011). HCV and HIV might employ similar strategy to antagonize eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation as HCV NS4B protein has been predicted to interact with PP1 and PP1 is required for HIV replication (Ammosova et al., 2003; Li et al., 2012). Another strategy involves regulation of the PERK activity. HSV-1 glycoprotein B(gB) interacts with the PERK luminal domain, which makes it refractory to acute ER stress (Mulvey et al., 2007). The Alphavirus CHIKV and Flaviviridae viruses (HCV, JEV and DENV) could repress the activity of PERK via transcriptional up-regulation of its inhibitor, p58IPK (Merquiol et al., 2011; Rathore et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2006). Some viral proteins even function as a pseudo-substrate of PERK to sequester its activity such as HCV E2 protein (Pavio et al., 2003) and DENV has been proposed to encode a viral protein similar to HCV E2 to block the PERK-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Pena & Harris, 2011).",

The IRE1-XBP1 and ATF6 pathways are activated during the mid and late infection, respectively, to help cells establish ER homeostasis and adapt to persistent ER stress without inducing apoptosis. HCV has also been shown to activate UPR in a temporal manner (Merquiol et al., 2011). There are two possible mechanisms that are responsible for the temporally modulated UPR by viruses. The first mechanism is related to differential expression of viral proteins at different stages and the typical example is HSV-1 (Burnett et al., 2012). During its early infection stage, only ATF6 proteolysis is induced but no up-regulation of its target chaperone proteins. Meanwhile, PERK-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ATF4 expression are down-regulated. These effects might be modulated by its early gene product ICP0. As virus infection proceeds, these activated UPR indicators are totally aborted due to its viral proteins, VHS and ICP27, which degrade certain cellular mRNAs (Elgadi et al., 1999). At the final infection stage, these inhibitory effects are relieved and cells initiate apoptosis, which may facilitate virus particles release from host cells. The second mechanism by which the UPR is temporally regulated is associated with the stability of viral proteins. For example, CHIKV suppresses phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at early infection stage due to expression of its nsP4 protein; however, as nsP4 protein is not stable, cells recovers phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at the late CHIKV infection stage (Rathore et al., 2013).",

The best-characterized mechanism is the IRE1-TRAF2-JNK pathway (Hotamisligil, 2010). Activated IRE1 interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), which then recruits apoptosis-signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) to initiate a cascade of phosphorylation events that activates Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) (Urano et al., 2000). The pivotal mediators that link JNK to apoptosis are Bcl-2 family proteins, which include anti-apoptotic four Bcl-2 homology domain-containing (BH) proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1), pro-apoptotic three BH-containing proteins (Bax, Bak) and pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (Bad, Bim, Bid, Noxa, Puma) (Galluzzi et al., 2008). BH3-only proteins are necessary for Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial permeabilization and release of Ca2+ from the ER into the cytosol but Bcl-2 promotes cell survival through sequestration of BH3-only proteins (Cheng et al., 2001). The released Ca2+ can be taken up by mitochondria, resulting in MPP loss and subsequent efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, which ultimately leading to apoptosis. JNK phosphorylates Bcl-2 to reduce its anti-apoptotic activity but phosphorylates BH3-only proteins to enhance its pro-apoptotic effects (Szegezdi et al., 2006). Moreover, prolonged activation of IRE1-mediated RIDD pathway may cause apoptosis by degrading mRNAs encoding essential cell-survival proteins (Hollien et al., 2009).",

In addition, CHOP triggers apoptosis through inducing the transcription of death receptor-5 (DR5) (Yamaguchi & Wang, 2004), tribbles-related protein 3 (TRB3) (Ohoka et al., 2005), GADD34 and ER oxidase 1\u03b1 (ERO1\u03b1) (Marciniak et al., 2004). DR5 is a critical mediator of ER stress-induced apoptosis in cancer cells and TRB3 promotes apoptosis presumably by binding to the pro-survival serine/threonine kinase Akt and reducing its kinase activity (Yamaguchi & Wang, 2004). GADD34 and ERO1\u03b1 mediate apoptosis by affecting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Marciniak et al., 2004).

This is not surprising given that their productive infection causes great damage to host cells. Among 23 apoptosis-inducing viruses, 5 viruses have been reported to trigger MMP loss and cytochrome c release into the cytosol including SFV, IPNV, DENV, HIV and MoMuLV. Four viruses (RGNNV, BVDV, CCHFV and IBV) might also induce MMP loss and cytochrome c release through regulating the upstream factors: Bcl-2, BH3-only proteins, Bax and Bak. 16 out of 23 viruses might induce apoptosis via the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP pathway including SFV, SINV, IPNV, CCHFV, TULV, IBV, BVDV, HCV, JEV, WNV, RGNNV, IAV, CDV, CVB3, RRV and MoMuLV with WNV and HCV being shown to induce the expression of CHOP to promote apoptosis (Benali-Furet et al., 2005; Medigeshi et al., 2007). Although HEV infection activates the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP pathway in human cells H1299, it fails to induce apoptosis (John et al., 2011). Only TULV activates the IRE1-TRAF2-JNK-dependent cell apoptosis. The rest four ER stress-triggering viruses (ASFV, HBV, RSV and VSV) are able to sensitize cells to apoptosis but it is unclear whether these effects are mediated by ER stress (Bitko & Barik, 2001; Gaddy & Lyles, 2005; Galindo et al., 2012; Kuo et al., 2012).",

For example, CDV-induced apoptosis may eventually lead to the neurodegenerative disease (Brunner et al., 2012). The RSV-induced cell death is a major cause of destruction of the lung epithelial in RSV-infected patients (Bitko & Barik, 2001). Apoptosis is also required for virus replication such as release and dissemination of virus particles. Activation of caspase-3 at the early stage of ASFV infection is required for virus exit (Galindo et al., 2012). Knockdown Mcl-1 in IBV-infected mammalian cells accelerates apoptosis and increases IBV progeny production and release, while knockdown Bak delays apoptosis and reduces the release of viral proteins and particles (Zhong et al., 2012). However, premature cell apoptosis may function as a host defense response by limiting virus replication and pathogenesis. For example, the virus titers of WNV are significantly increased in CHOP-deficient cells that are resistant to ER stress-mediated apoptosis (Medigeshi et al., 2007). In addition, HBV has been shown to prevent apoptosis to facilitate the release and spread of infectious progeny (Arzberger et al., 2010).",

            "text": "To overcome the host resistance, viruses have evolved a battery of distinct strategies to subvert apoptosis to optimize their infection (Table 1 and Figure 2). One strategy is to modulate the expression and/or activity of components in the apoptotic pathways including the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP and IRE1-TRAF2-JNK. HCMV pUL38 protein has been reported to protect primary human foreskin fibroblasts from apoptosis by blocking the phosphorylation of PERK and activation of JNK (Xuan et al., 2009). ASFV infection down-regulates the transcription of CHOP, perhaps to prevent host cell death and prolong viral replication (Galindo et al., 2012; Galluzzi et al., 2008). Some viruses modulate apoptosis by targeting BH3-only proteins and Bcl-2 protein. EBV EBNA 3A and 3C proteins suppress the expression of BH3-only protein Bim and Noxa in B cells (Yee et al., 2011). PEDV E protein might suppress apoptosis by up-regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (Xu et al., 2013a) and further efforts are required to confirm it. Certain ER stress-triggering viruses inhibit apoptosis by modulating the activities of caspases. For example, ASFV A224L protein inhibits caspase-3 (Galluzzi et al., 2008) and HCMV UL36 protein blocks apoptosis by binding to the pro-domain of caspase-8 and inhibiting its activation (Skaletskaya et al., 2001). Other strategy involves encoding anti-apoptotic viral proteins that share significant sequence similarity with Bcl-2 family and these viral Bcl-2 proteins (vBcl-2s) preferentially bind to pro-apoptotic Bax and Bad and inhibit Bax/Bad-mediated apoptosis. For instance, IPNV VP5, ASFV A179L, HCMV pUL37x1 and EBV (BALF1, BHRF1) proteins exert anti-apoptotic effects presumably due to their Bcl-2 motif (Galluzzi et al., 2008; Hong et al., 2002). In addition, some viruses antagonize apoptosis by inducing the expression of chaperones or heat shock proteins, which could interfere with the functions of CHOP (Gotoh et al., 2004). HEV ORF2 protein has been suggested to prevent CHOP-mediated apoptosis through inducing Hsp70B', Hsp72 and Hsp40 (John et al., 2011). Besides, HCV (NS2, NS5A), SV5 (V, SH), SARS-CoV E and RSV (NS1, NS2) proteins have been reported to inhibit apoptosis through unknown mechanisms (Bitko & Barik, 2001; Bitko et al., 2007; DeDiego et al., 2011; Galluzzi et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2004).",

First, compared with DNA viruses, RNA viruses usually have relatively short replication period and can replicate to high titers before the infected cells undergo cell death. Hence, most ER stress-triggering RNA viruses (SFV, IPNV, CCHFV, TULV, SARS-CoV, DENV, JEV, WNV, RGNNV, IAV, CDV, RSV, MoMuLV and FrCasE) tend to induce apoptosis; while ER stress-triggering DNA viruses (ASFV, EBV, HCMV) tend to protect the infected cells from apoptosis (Table 1 and Figure 2). Second, various types of cells adapt the ER capacity for different purposes and accordingly, may respond differentially to exogenous stimuli. For example, compared with epithelial cells, hepatocytes are specialized secretory cells that synthesize and secret large quantities of proteins and thereby are more sensitive to ER stress (Hassan et al., 2012; Hetz, 2012). As expected, in HCV- or HBV-infected hepatocytes, the ATF6 pathway is preferentially activated to induce the transcription of chaperones; whereas in IAV-infected epithelial cells, ATF6 and its target chaperones are not activated (Hassan et al., 2012).",

VSV, HCV and SARS-CoV are able to inhibit the type I IFN signaling pathway by activating the PERK, which leads to the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the IFN \u03b1-receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1), thereby promoting immune evasion and virus pathogenesis (Liu et al., 2009; Minakshi et al., 2009). WNV has also been reported to induce ER stress and inhibit type I IFN signaling pathway to facilitate the escape from the host immune response and viral pathogenesis (Ambrose & Mackenzie, 2011). HCMV US11 protein activates the UPR to facilitate the degradation of class I major histocompatibility complex, leading to immune evasion (Tirosh et al., 2005). Moreover, ER stress is responsible for viral pathogenesis by interconnecting with the inflammatory responses. For example, HCV induces inflammatory responses by activating IRE1, which interacts with TRAF2 to phosphorylate JNK, leading to activation of inflammation mediators (Merquiol et al., 2011; Zhang & Kaufman, 2008). HCV NS4B and NS5A activate NF-\u03baB via ER stress-elicited calcium depletion and ROS production (Gong et al., 2001; Li et al., 2009). Cho et al. found that HBV X protein (HBx) induces the expression of COS2 (cyclo-oxygenase 2), a key mediator of inflammation, through PERK-eIF2\u03b1-activated ATF4 (Cho et al., 2011).",

The first class of antiviral targets involves the three UPR pathways. The PERK-eIF2\u03b1 pathway has been extensively investigated for antiviral development. Boyce and colleagues identified a small chemical compound salubrinal, a specific inhibitor of PP1/GADD34 complex and found it blocks HSV \u03b3134.5-mediated eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation and efficiently reduces HSV replication (Boyce et al., 2005). Salubrinal has also been shown to inhibit the replication of DENV through attenuating PP1/GADD34-mediated eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation (Umareddy et al., 2007). The clinically achievable reagent glucose analog 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose, which induces the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, has been reported to suppress herpesvirus (KSHV) replication and serve as a novel anti-herpesviral therapy (Leung et al., 2012). Moreover, the IRE1-XBP1 pathway has become the target for antiviral development. Hassan et al. found that 3,5-dibromosalicyladehyde, which is a specific inhibitor of IRE1 endoribonuclease, significantly blocks IAV replication (Hassan et al., 2012). The IRE1-XBP1 pathway agonist, WP1130, has broad antiviral effects against SINV, murine norovirus (MNV-1) and La Crosse virus (Perry et al., 2012). It remains to be determined whether ATF6 and its downstream genes (chaperone proteins) can be potential targets.

Firstly, for most ER stress-triggering viruses, less is known about the precise mechanism by which virus activates ER stress as much work is focused on detecting ER stress indicators during virus infection. Based on the published data (Table 1), the mechanisms may be related to the rapid synthesis and accumulation of viral proteins inside the ER lumen, the interactions of viral proteins with ER host factors including UPR sensors, the disturbance of ER membrane by virus replication. Secondly, for most ER stress-triggering viruses, it remains unclear about which viral protein(s) attributes to the occurrence of ER stress. Characterizing these proteins and elucidating the underlying mechanisms will undoubtedly help us understand the virus life cycle and pathogenesis. Most importantly, these viral proteins can be potential therapeutic targets to cure virus infection. Thirdly, little is known about how viruses activate the UPR transducers but selectively regulate their target genes. For example, ASFV activates ATF6 and its transcriptional targets calnexin and calreticulin but has no effects on XBP1 or GRP78 (Galindo et al., 2012). Fourthly, despite much is known about the regulation of ER stress by viruses, how virus-triggered ER stress regulates the intricate balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic effects and how these events results in cell death commitment remain enigmatic.
