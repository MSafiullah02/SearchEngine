However, since we receive pieces of information from multiple sources, this has also made the information ecosystem highly competitive; in fact, users\u2019 influence and visibility are highly heterogeneous, and topics strive for users\u2019 attention in online social systems. Although several studies have described the dynamics of information flow in popular communication media [1\u20135], the main factors determining the observed patterns have not been identified, and there is no theoretical framework that addresses this challenge. Indeed, given the potential for applications\u2014e.g., having more efficient systems to spread information for safety and preparedness in the face of threats\u2014a better understanding of how memes (ideas, hashtags, etc.) emerge and compete in online social networks is critical.",

            "text": "Information often spreads through a social network as a cascade: A person adopts a new behavior, installs a new app, or sends a news item or rumor to his friends (e.g., by tweeting it on Twitter). The avalanche spreads if the friends decide to also adopt the new behavior and in turn pass on the social influence effect to their own friends, who may further propagate the behavior. Following the usage in the review [6], we apply the term \u201csocial spreading phenomena\u201d to describe such cascading or \u201cviral\u201d propagation [7]. The latter term is used because the description of information spreading bears some similarity to epidemics of contagious disease; the effects of network structure on disease contagion have been well studied by physicists [8] (see Ref. [9] for a recent review). However, unlike epidemics of a single disease strain, we focus on social spreading phenomena that occur in the presence of competition between a large number of different items of similar type. Examples of the types of items include URLs on Twitter [1,2], apps on Facebook [5,10], or videos on YouTube [11]. In each of these examples, users make choices\u2014often influenced by the choices they have seen their friends make\u2014and the accumulation of many choices leads to a distribution of popularity of the items: Some items become extremely popular, while other items remain obscure.",

Note that we do not restrict our study only to very popular memes; indeed, our interest is in understanding the entire popularity distributions of memes, from the unpopular to the very popular. This definition of a meme has also been used by researchers studying cascades on Facebook [14], the spreading of news through blogs [15], and the popularity of hashtags on Twitter [3,16], but it can also be applied to analyze popularity distributions of offline items (where copying promotes spreading) such as baby names [17], dog breeds [18], and even citations (which are a type of popularity measure) of scientific papers [19,20]. The memes in these examples are all relatively simple units of information that are easily identified in data sets; recent work has also demonstrated that more complex memes (represented by the appearance of common phrases, such as \u201cquantum\u201d or \u201cgraphene,\u201d in the scientific literature) can be recognized by their inheritance patterns in the citation network [21].",

The statistical physics of avalanches has been studied in the context of condensed-matter systems, where the flip of a single magnetic spin domain can cause its neighboring domains to also flip and thus initiate a cascade [26]. If the physical parameters of such a system are tuned to place it at a critical point [27], the sizes of avalanches are power-law distributed; the sandpile model of self-organized criticality (SOC) self-tunes so that the system balances at the critical point [28]. However, unlike the memoryless particles or magnetic spins that constitute the microscopic entities in condensed-matter avalanches, humans absorb and transmit information on a wide variety of time scales that range from seconds to weeks [29,30]. Models of social interaction must therefore include \u201cmemory\u201d effects (non-Markovian aspects) that lead to the emergence of characteristics that are qualitatively different from those seen in condensed-matter avalanches. The non-Markovian aspects of human temporal behavior have attracted considerable recent attention (e.g., Refs. [31\u201335]), but we wish to investigate the effects of memory on popularity avalanches caused by users choosing between multiple items that they have seen in the past.",

Our probabilistic model, in contrast to other studies [3\u20135,19,36] that use intensive computational simulations to fit to data, allows us to get analytical insights into the respective roles of the network degree distribution, the memory-time distribution of users, and the competition between memes for the limited resource of user attention. The model is a \u201cnull model\u201d in the sense that it is analytically tractable, yet realistic enough to be fitted to empirical data and to reproduce some important characteristics of the data. We show that fitting to time-dependent data requires a nontrivial memory-time distribution, which is not possible with the toy model of Ref. [37], where users can remember only one meme. However, the phenomenon of \u201ccompetition-induced criticality\u201d that was first identified in Ref. [37] is shown to be robust to the inclusion of memory times, heterogeneous user activity rates, and complex network structures in the more realistic model used here. The current model requires more sophisticated mathematical analysis than that of Ref. [37] to deal with the long memory of users, but it enables us to understand how heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity evolve over a range of time scales, as a few memes \u201cgo viral\u201d but the majority become only moderately popular.",

However, it should be clear that the model and its results can also be extended to the other examples of viral phenomena discussed above. For the adoption of apps on Facebook, for example, the memes are the notifications sent when a user installs an app [10]. If a friend is prompted by this notification to also install the app, then the meme propagates on the network and its popularity is measured by the number of installations of the app. We show that the crucial property of the model that poises the system at criticality is the competitive pressure for the limited resource of user attention, and this property is common to a broad range of social spreading phenomena that are characterized by the availability of large time-dependent data sets.",

A Poisson process is characterized by an exponential distribution of interevent times, where each event corresponds to an innovation or a retweeting action. This assumption is contrary to studies such as Refs. [29,30,33\u201335,53\u201359], where heavy-tailed distributions of interevent times are examined. Despite this, in our model the memory-time distribution \u03a6(tm) directly influences the waiting times (or \u201cresponse times\u201d) between the receipt of a specific meme and the retweeting of it. Indeed, if \u03a6(tm) is a heavy-tailed distribution, then a meme received by a given user at time \u03c4 will be retweeted by that user at a time t (with t\u226b\u03c4) with probability proportional to \u03a6(t-\u03c4) (the exact relation depends on how long the meme occupies the stream of the user). Therefore, a heavy-tailed memory distribution gives rise to a heavy-tailed waiting-time distribution for individual memes, despite the fact that the activity of each individual user is described by a Poisson process (cf. the heavy-tailed waiting-time distributions found in empirical studies of email correspondence [29,30]). It is clearly important to distinguish between the distributions of interevent times (for actions of users) and of the waiting times experienced by individual memes; the model assumes each user has exponentially distributed interevent times, but it can nevertheless produce heavy-tailed distributions of waiting times for memes to be retweeted.",

Restricting our attention to the simplified case as above and taking the infinite-age limit, we find that the expected popularity for a meme that is initiated by a seed node of out-degree k is mk(\u221e)=\u03bbz+1\u03bbz+\u03bc(1+\u03bb(1-\u03bc)\u03bc(\u03bbz+1)k).(44)Note the linear dependence of this expression on the number of followers k of the seed node: Memes tweeted by users with a large number of followers are likely to become more popular than memes seeded by less influential nodes. This feature of the model matches well to the observed dependence of the size of information cascades on the connectivity of the initial seed (e.g., Fig. 2 of Ref. [62]). Of course, the earlier results for randomly chosen seeds are recovered by averaging over all possible seed nodes: m(\u221e)=\u2211kpkmk(\u221e)=1/\u03bc.",

Each innovation event thus increases the number of distinct hashtags that appear in the data set by 1, whereas a noninnovative (copying) tweet will instead increase the number of copies of a hashtag that is already present in the data set. We can therefore calculate an upper bound on the empirical innovation probability from the ratio \u03bc\u02dc=number of distinct hashtags used in the data settotal number of hashtags tweeted by users=3227995886837=0.055.(53)Note that this upper bound is consistent with the parameter value of \u03bc=0.033 that is fitted in Fig. 6. The reason why Eq.

IV E, the large-n asymptotics of the popularity distribution are found from the small-w expansion (with w=1-x) of h(a;x)=1-H(a;x), and for the scale-free out-degree distribution, we obtain from Eq. (A10) (using the final value theorem for Laplace transforms) the following asymptotic behavior in the a\u2192\u221e limit: h(\u221e;1-w)\u223c(\u03bbz+1)C-[1/(\u03b3-1)]w[1/(\u03b3-1)]as  w\u21920.(54)Understanding the large-a approach to this steady state (i.e., the case where a is large but finite) is a difficult problem in asymptotic analysis, involving the double limits n\u2192\u221e and a\u2192\u221e. However, some insight can be obtained by factoring the function h into a product of its infinite-age limit h(\u221e;x) and another function h1, with h1 limiting to 1 as a\u2192\u221e: h(a;x)=h(\u221e;x)h1(a;x).(55)Taking Laplace transforms gives h^(s;x)=h(\u221e;x)h^1(s;x),(56)where h^1(s;1-w)=\u03bbz(s+\u03bbz+\u03a6^(s))s(\u03bbz+1)(s+\u03bbz)(\u03b3-1)\u03bbD[1/(\u03b3-1)][\u0393(1-\u03b3)][1/(\u03b3-1)]w[(\u03b3-2)/(\u03b3-1)]\u03a6^(s)s+\u03bbz-\u03bbz\u03a6^(s)+(\u03b3-1)\u03bbD[1/(\u03b3-1)][\u0393(1-\u03b3)][1/(\u03b3-1)]w[(\u03b3-2)/(\u03b3-1)]\u03a6^(s).(57)In particular, note that h^1(s;1-w) depends on w only through the factor w[(\u03b3-2)/(\u03b3-1)]. In the case where \u03b3 is very close to 2, the exponent (\u03b3-2)/(\u03b3-1) of the w dependence is close to zero, and the dependence of h1 on w is therefore very weak. It follows that the rate of approach of the corresponding distribution qn(a) to the steady state qn(\u221e) does not show a strong dependence on n, and the CCDFs for various ages appear almost parallel in the log-log plot of Fig. 6(a) (note \u03b3=2.13 in the Twitter network).",

This neutrality of the model is at the root of the criticality of the dynamical system [39]. A related (discrete-time) model for the number of citations gained by scientific papers was analyzed in Ref. [19], where the authors also extended their neutral model to include unequal fitnesses of papers. It is likely that our model could be extended in a similar way to incorporate a fitness parameter for each individual meme. Based on the results of Ref. [19], we expect that our main results would be qualitatively unaffected if the distribution of fitness values over the set of all memes is strongly peaked (i.e., if most memes have roughly equal fitness values, with only the high-fitness outliers demonstrating supercritical popularity growth).",

            "text": "Perhaps the most unrealistic aspect of the current model is the assumption that all users have constant activity rates, so their tweeting activity is described by a Poisson process (see the discussion in Sec. III B). It would be interesting to relax this assumption, for example, to allow the activity of users to be described by models such as that of Ref. [73] or by inhomogeneous Poisson processes: The latter incorporates time-varying activity rates and thus could model the 24-hour variability in tweeting levels determined by daily patterns [30]. However, we believe that the near-critical aspect of the model will not be strongly affected by such generalizations. To see this, consider the heuristic derivation of the branching number \u03be that was described at the end of Sec. IV A. Over a sufficiently long time window W, the expected number of interesting memes received into the stream of a (j,k)-class user is linear in the number j of users followed, and this remains true even for inhomogeneous Poisson (or even non-Poisson) activities, provided that the observation window is long enough (e.g., such that the average rate \u03b2\u00af of incoming tweets should yield approximately similar values when time averaged over disjoint time windows of length W). Similarly, the expected number of retweets by the user during the time window can be written as in Eq. (23) but with the Poisson rate \u03b2jk replaced by its time-averaged value. The calculations of Eq. (24) then proceed as before, leading to the conclusion that the branching number limits to the critical value of 1 as \u03bc\u21920, which implies that non-Poisson user activity rates (or burstiness) will not affect the criticality of the model, which is a long-time (i.e., ages of memes limited to infinity) characteristic. Of course, the short-term behavior of the model [such as the small-a behavior in panels (b)\u2013(e) of Fig. 4] would be affected by introducing burstiness; incorporating such realistic features into the model is left as a challenge for further work. As a final comment on this topic, we note that the agreement (in Sec. VI) of our theoretical results with real data of a spreading process for which users\u2019 activity rates are not constant also provides indirect evidence that the phenomenology discussed is robust to the details of user activity burstiness.",

IV A also offers a clue as to how the model can be extended to the spreading of information on undirected social networks (as opposed to the directed networks that we focus on in this paper). Of particular interest is the spreading of app adoption on Facebook, for which data were analyzed in Ref. [10] and a computational model was introduced in Ref. [5]. If the Facebook update messages that inform all friends of user A that she has installed a particular app are considered to be the memes in a version of our model, then the arguments of Sec. IV A need only slight modifications. The total number of update messages received in the stream of a user with k Facebook friends is linear in k [i.e., the j in the denominator of Eq. (22) is replaced by k], while the expected number of friends who would be interested in user A\u2019s adoption of the app is \u03bb(k-1) (since one friend out of k must have adopted it before A in order to have spread the message to her). Following very similar steps to calculate the expected number \u03be of children of a meme\u2014see the calculations leading to Eq.

[74] calculated z\u2248190), so \u03beundirected is in fact very close to unity, implying that the information-spread process is close to criticality. Such a near-critical branching process was hypothesized in Ref. [5] to explain the observed fat-tailed distributions of app popularity in Facebook data and the temporal characteristics of the adoption behavior. The cascade sizes for other forms of \u201cmeme\u201d spreading on Facebook have also been observed to have fat-tailed distributions [14]. Other undirected networks to which the model should be applicable include YouTube [63] and Digg [2,75].",

We argue that null models are fundamentally important in this quest\u2014and complement more data-driven approaches\u2014as they demonstrate, for example, that extreme popularity can arise purely because of random fluctuations in the competition between memes for user attention. While the content of a meme may well be an important factor in its popularity (or predictability [11]), definitive statements about the significance of such factors should be referenced to an appropriate null model.",

The model is sufficiently general to incorporate heterogeneous user activity rates and a joint distribution pjk of the number of users followed j and the number of followers k, as well as a memory-time distribution \u03a6 that gives non-Markovian dynamics. The competition-induced criticality phenomenon identified in a zero-memory model in Ref. [37] is found to be robust to the generalizations, giving power-law popularity distributions with characteristic time dependence similar to data from social spreading phenomena (see Sec.

We find that a simplified version of the model where users all have the same activity rate can be fitted to some, but not all, aspects of the data (see Fig. 6). The aim of a null model is not to perfectly reproduce every aspect of a data set but rather to help identify which features of the data can be reproduced using relatively simple models, thus to highlight aspects where more detailed modeling (or, perhaps, factors entirely outside the model) are required to match to data. In this respect, the null model highlights the fact that heterogeneity in activity rates is vital to accurately capture the q1(a) curve [compare Figs. 6(d) and 7(d)], even though the time dependence of the bulk of the popularity distribution may be described reasonably well by a model with homogeneous activity rates [Figs. 6(a)\u20136(c)].",
