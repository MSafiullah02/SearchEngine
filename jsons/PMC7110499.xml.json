Influenza vaccines are required annually to immunize a large number of people to prevent influenza. The highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H7N9, as well as 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, have infected humans and caused sporadic cases or epidemics [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], calling for continuous efforts to develop vaccines to prevent the threat of influenza. Current influenza vaccines are mainly strain-specific, targeting one or more closely related strains, and having limited efficacy to prevent divergent and new viral strains [10], [11], [12]. Thus, development of effective universal vaccines with cross-protective efficacy against variant influenza viruses has been the focus of influenza researches.",

However, containing only 24 amino acids, the M2e molecule is a poor inducer of immune response, elucidating the need to improve its immunogenicity in designing influenza vaccines. A number of approaches, including conjugating M2e with other carrier proteins, such as Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane complex (OMPC) and bacterial flagellin, or increasing the copy numbers of M2e molecules, have been introduced to increase the immunogenicity and/or protective efficacy of M2e-based vaccines [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. In addition to M2e, fusion peptide (FP) epitope in the hemagglutinin 2 (HA2) stem region of influenza virus is also highly conserved in influenza A viruses, making it as another important vaccine target [14], [20], [21]. Chimeric vaccines or synthetic peptides containing conserved HA2 sequences may induce cross-reactive and cross-protective antibodies against divergent influenza viruses [22], [23], [24], constituting a key approach to develop universal influenza vaccines.",

We further evaluated the immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy of these two subunit vaccines against a heterologous strain of H1N1 influenza virus.

Briefly, BALB/c mice were intramuscularly (i.m.) immunized with M2e-FP-1 or M2e-FP-2 (10 \u03bcg/50 \u03bcl/mouse) in the presence of aluminum adjuvant, and boosted twice at a 3-week interval. Mice injected with PBS plus above adjuvant were included as a negative control. Sera were collected before each vaccination, and measured for influenza virus M2e-FP-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies. One month post-last immunization, mice were challenged with A/PR/8/34(H1N1) influenza virus (103 50% tissue culture infectious dose: TCID50). The infected mice were then detected for pathological changes by H&E staining and viral titers in lung tissues at 5 days post-infection (p.i.), or observation of survivals and weight changes for 14 days p.i.",

Further evaluation of antibody subtypes revealed that high titers of M2e-FP-specific IgG2a (Th1), particularly IgG1 (Th2), antibodies were induced in the sera of protein-immunized mice collected at 9 weeks post-immunization, but not in those of the control mice injected with PBS (Fig. 2B\u2013C).

As expected, mice immunized with the two fusion proteins had significantly lower titers of virus in their lungs than those of the control mice receiving PBS (Fig. 3\nA). Analysis of the pathological changes demonstrated that both fusion proteins effectively protected mice against H1N1 infection, with obviously alleviated lung damage and the presence of BALT (bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue) surrounding the lung bronchial tube (Fig. 3B, left and middle), a characteristic helping for restoring lung tissue cells. In contrast, there was serious mesenchymal inflammation in the lung tissue of the control mice, which was represented by thickened alveolar walls, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage, and vessel inflammation (Fig. 3B, right).

Indeed, we have previously indicated that a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide (MAP)-based vaccine (H5N1-M2e-MAP) carrying four copies of H5N1 M2e peptide conferred cross-protection against lethal infection of two clades of H5N1 and one pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses [31], [36]. We have also demonstrated the ability of a recombinant fusion protein (M2e3-ASP-1) containing three conserved H5N1 M2e molecules and a new Onchocerca volvulus activation associated protein-1 (ASP-1) adjuvant in cross-protection against two divergent strains of H5N1 influenza viruses [25]. In addition, H5N1 M2e peptide-based vaccines were developed to test the cross-protection of H5N1 M2e against infection of the new H7N9 virus, and the H5N1 M2e vaccination provided potent cross-protection against lethal challenge of H7N9 virus [37], [38]. In this study, we designed two recombinant universal influenza vaccines by respectively linking two molecules of M2e and one molecule of HA-FP sequences of H5N1 and H7N9 in two different orders, and evaluated their immunogenicity and protection against a heterologous H1N1 strain. The sequences of M2e and HA-FP used in this study are highly conserved among all influenza A virus strains, maintaining over 90% homology. As expected, both proteins linked through two different orders of M2e and FP molecules were able to induce effective antibody responses and cross-protection against lethal challenge of A/PR/8/34(H1N1) influenza virus with 100% survival rate, indicating that H5N1 and H7N9 M2e and HA-FP recombinant protein-based universal vaccines have capacity to elicit sufficient cross-protective efficacy against infection of heterologous strain of H1N1 influenza virus.",

Studies have shown that the mechanisms of cross-protection by influenza virus M2e-based vaccines may be through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytolysis (CDC) [39], [40]. In addition to M2e molecules, our recombinant proteins also contain HA-FP conserved epitope sequences. Future studies are warranted to further elucidate the protective mechanisms of M2e and HA-FP-based recombinant vaccines, as well as to detect their efficacy in protecting against multiple current and future strains of influenza virus with pandemic potential.",
