The main function of the olfactory system is the detection of chemical stimuli present in the host environment and the transduction of these stimuli into electrical signals that reach the higher regions of the brain. One of the unique features of the olfactory system is that the sensory neurons that make up the olfactory neuroepithelium are constantly exposed to pathogens and symbionts, establishing the most intimate interactions between neurons and microorganisms found in the human body.",

First, the olfactory system is directly connected to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory bulb and therefore numerous neurotropic agents including parasites, bacteria and viruses can reach the CNS via transport along the olfactory nerve. Examples of neurotropic human pathogens that exploit the nasal route of infection include viruses such as herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), coronavirus (HCov), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus; bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei. Listeria monocytogenes; and the protozoan Naegleria fowleri (Dando et al., 2014) (Table 1\n). Second, the olfactory system is part of the upper respiratory tract in mammals and therefore, pathogens can reach other parts of the respiratory system once they successfully invade the olfactory mucosa. Examples of respiratory pathogens that are known to infect the human olfactory organ include influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae. Third, the upper respiratory system is also connected to the gastrointestinal tract via the esophagus and therefore it is possible for pathogens that cause gastric infection to cause nasal diseases. Although this route is less well studied, some examples may include human bocavirus (HBoV), human rotavirus (HRV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Salmonella enterica (Table 1).",

D-NALT is found in all vertebrates whereas O-NALT may have first appeared in sarcopterygian fish (Tacchi et al., 2015, Sepahi et al., 2016). Human O-NALT is formed by a series of tonsils (palatine, nasopharyngeal and lingual) arranged in a circular fashion in the oropharyngeal cavity that form the Waldeyer's ring (Fig. 1\nA) (Zaman et al., 2013). The human Waldeyer's ring is an induction site for mucosal immune responses (Zaman et al., 2013). As we will discuss later, O-NALT anatomy differs among different vertebrate groups and a Waldeyer's ring similar to that of humans is not always present.",

            "text": "Invertebrates do not have an anatomical structure that forms an olfactory organ. Instead, a network of sensory neurons is found in their body. For example, the C. elegans nervous system is composed of 302 neurons which allow the animal to respond adequately to a variety of environmental stimuli and/or stressors such as chemotaxis, thermotaxis, mechanosensation, navigation, learning and olfactory sensation (Bargmann et al., 1993, Ha et al., 2010, Iino and Yoshida, 2009, Kato et al., 2013, Troemel et al., 1997). Together with AWB, two other pairs of neurons ASH and ADL are responsible for the avoidance behavior. ASH neurons mainly respond to high osmolarity, heavy metals, bitter alkaloids, detergents, and light touch to the tip of the nose (Active et al., 2001, Hilliard et al., 2004, Kaplan and Horvitz, 1993). ADL neurons, in turn, respond to social feeding behavior (Bono et al., 2002). Therefore, C. elegans has four neuronal cells (2 AWA and 2 AWC) to sense and discriminate a variety of volatile attractants. As in humans and other animals, C. elegans is also able to respond differently to the same odorants at different concentrations. Whereas high concentrations of an odorant result in repulsive behavior, low concentrations of the same odorant trigger attraction behavior (Yoshida et al., 2012).",

In the human embryo, the VNO is similar to that of others species, with bipolar neurons similar to vomeronasal sensory neurons. During development, the VNO is reduced to a more simplified structure until it disappears at 19 weeks (Meredith, 2001). Similarly, other tetrapod species have also lost functional VNOs including cetaceans, some bats, crocodiles and primates (Mucignat-Caretta et al., 2012). This is not the case of mice, in which the VNO is functional throughout life and it plays a vital role in the induction of neuro-hormonal changes due to direct contact with pheromonal stimuli (Mucignat-Caretta et al., 2012).",

Due to the limited number of neurons in the C. elegans body, odorant recognition power is limited (Active et al., 2001).

As mentioned earlier, one of the most prominent characteristics of OSNs is their ability to express only one type of OR. Additionally, all OSNs expressing the same receptor converge in the same glomerular area in the olfactory bulb (Gao et al., 2000). Several molecular features of sensory systems are not only conserved within vertebrates but are also found in invertebrates. Among these commonalities is the presence of GPCRs, expressed by the OSNs, as the main odorant receptors in worms, flies, several fishes (i.e. trout and zebrafish), mouse and human (Mori and Sakano, 2011). In mouse, for example there are more than 1000 different ORs and each OSN express only one OR gene. Neuropeptides are also conserved in many species including nematodes, flies and mammals and are important modulators of odorant responses in the OSNs. In fact, neuropeptides may facilitate or reduce the activity of OSNs and this regulation helps the animal to localize odors and food sources with great accuracy (Leinwand and Chalasani, 2011, Zhang et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Perhaps the best described invertebrate model system in neuroimmunology is C. elegans. C. elegans feed on bacteria and therefore are attracted to bacterial-derived food odorants (Stensmyr et al., 2012). Additionally, several laboratories have identified pathogenic bacteria that infect C. elegans including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcensens (Pradel et al., 2007). Pathogenic bacteria and some of their metabolites induce aversive behaviors in C. elegans and this behavior is mediated by chemosensory neurons (Beale et al., 2006, Schulenburg and Ewbank, 2007). Moreover, elegant studies have demonstrated the key role that sensory neurons play in the regulation of the inflammatory response of worms against pathogens. The C. elegans model has therefore demonstrated that animals have the ability to discern between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria using sensory neurons (Pradel et al., 2007). Additionally, microsporidia, natural viruses and non-natural viruses including VSV (Balla and Troemel, 2014), can infect C. elegans and these models are readily available for the study of neuroimmune responses during infection. Thus, the detailed map of the C. elegans nervous system and the conserved nature of the chemosensory transduction machinery between C. elegans and vertebrates, makes the worm a suitable laboratory model for the understanding of how animals respond to microorganisms. Additional strengths of this model include: high throughput screening protocols, established behavioral assays and availability of bacterial and viral infection models. However, C. elegans lacks a complex neuroepithelium similar to the vertebrate olfactory epithelium as well as a CNS. Thus, using this model, the immunological contributions of different cell types to pathogens as well as the cross-talk between the peripheral and CNS during the course of an infection cannot be investigated (Table 2\n).",

            "text": "Teleost fish have also recently emerged as a great model to investigate nasal immunity. The discovery of teleost NALT a few years ago (Salinas, 2015, Tacchi et al., 2014) revealed the conserved nature of this lymphoid tissue in vertebrates. Since teleost NALT only contains d-NALT (Tacchi et al., 2014), teleost fish can now be used to investigate d-NALT responses to pathogens without the use of transgenic animals or surgical procedures. Teleost NALT is composed of B cells (IgM+ and IgT+ B cells) that are scattered throughout the olfactory epithelium and are mostly located intraepithelially (Tacchi et al., 2014). Additionally, two different CD8\u03b1+ T cell populations have been described in trout NALT, one in the lateral sensory epithelium and one in the apical mucosal epithelium (Sepahi et al., 2016). CD4+ T cells have not been investigated in teleost NALT thus far. Finally, abundant MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells are found in both the sensory and mucosal epithelium in the trout olfactory organ, but those located in the mucosal tips are found more apically and therefore closer to luminal antigens (Sepahi et al., 2016). Nasal immune responses of rainbow trout against neurotropic viruses such as rhabdoviruses (Tacchi et al., 2014, Larragoite et al., 2016) and protozoan parasites such as Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Yu et al., 2018) have been described. These studies indicate that NALT mounts strong innate and adaptive immune responses upon vaccination or infection in bony fish. Importantly, nasal delivery of a live attenuated viral vaccine not only causes local nasal immune responses and systemic immune responses (Tacchi et al., 2014) but also immune responses in the CNS (Larragoite et al., 2016). Interestingly, these responses are recorded even in the absence of virus in CNS tissues (Larragoite et al., 2016, Sepahi et al., 2018). With regards to specific antibody responses, it appears that IgT is the main antibody isotype involved in specific immune responses against protozoan parasites causing chronic infections in trout NALT (Yu et al., 2018). These findings confirmed that IgT is the functional equivalent to mammalian IgA in nasal secretions and that nasal IgT responses are likely the gold-standard to evaluate specific immune responses, at least in chronic infection models.",

Zebrafish is largely used due to the small body size, rapid life cycle, transparency at the early stages of life and the large numbers of eggs available every week. Moreover, zebrafish resilience and amenability to genetic manipulation techniques have allowed the generation of a broad number of transgenic lines used for studying hematopoiesis, aging, development or cancer. Complex host-microbe interactions can be investigated in real time using life imaging and fluorescently labeled pathogens. Finally, germ-free (GF) zebrafish provide a platform for the identification of microbial contributions to disease onset and progression (Kostic et al., 2013, Melancon et al., 2017, Rawls et al., 2004).",

As a consequence, oculo-nasal vaccination is one of the most common routes of vaccination in poultry farms (Nochi et al., 2018). For instance, MSD manufactures oculo-nasal spray vaccines for IBV and NDV. Intranasal vaccination induces specific IgA responses locally and in serum in chickens (Zhao et al., 2016) and ducks (Kang et al., 2012), making the induction of specific IgA titers a common readout following nasal vaccination both in humans and birds (Table 2). Comparisons between the nasal immune response of chickens and ducks to influenza virus are interesting because ducks are asymptomatic and chickens are highly susceptible accidental hosts (Chaise et al., 2014).",

Apart from the small size, human and ferrets have similar lung physiological characteristics, and when intranasally inoculated with influenza virus, ferrets showed human clinical symptoms such as fever, nasal secretion, coughing and sneezing; which are not present in the classical mouse model (Belser et al., 2011, Zitzow et al., 2002) (Table 2). Importantly, ferrets have pharyngeal tonsils which are often analyzed in experimental infection models (van den Brand et al., 2012, Lipatov et al., 2009). Moreover, an aged ferret model has been developed to better investigate the effects of aging on the immune responses to influenza A H1N1 strain (Paquette et al., 2014). The high susceptibility to influenza along with the ability to infect healthy ferrets, make these animals a suitable model to follow host-virus interactions (Belser et al., 2011). Along with the influenza infection model, ferrets have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of novel vaccine candidates including FluMist and M2SR. M2SR evokes a wide antibody immune response in ferrets both locally and systemically. Moreover, this vaccine has a protective effect against the drifted viruses H3N2 and H1N1 in both ferrets with and without pre-existing immunity. Thus, M2RS have been considered as a suitable candidate for a large spectrum human vaccine suitable for all ages (Hatta et al., 2018).",

In particular, cotton rats were infected with several influenza virus A strains including H1N1, H3N2 and influenza virus B to determine the infectivity as well as the pathogenesis. Interestingly, all the viruses were able to replicate in the nose and lung. Moreover, concomitant to the lung infection with influenza virus A, a strong immune response characterized by IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6 was detected (Eichelberger, 2007).",

In contrast, cotton rats offer many advantages to the study of RSV pathology because they are more permissive to RSV infection than mice and they show human-like disease symptoms upon infection (Boukhvalova et al., 2010) (Table 2). Thus, cotton rats offer a valid model to study the pathogenesis of RSV and to develop and test vaccines and therapies against this virus (Citron et al., 2018, Sami et al., 1995). As an example, intramuscular immunization with virus-like particles containing the pre-fusion protein F of RSV (Pre-F/F VLPs), induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies and protected the cotton rat lung and nasal cavity from viral replication. Interestingly, animals previously infected and then challenged with RSV had undetectable viral loads in the nose. Hence, intranasal immunization with VLPs may lead to better stimulation of mucosal immune responses and greater protection, compared to other routes of immunization (Cullen et al., 2015).",

Nasal carriage of S. aureus is an important risk factor for S. aureus infections in both adults and children (Kluytmans and Verbrugh, 1997, Mulcahy and McLoughlin, 2016). Cotton rats can successfully be infected with S. aureus by nasal instillation of live bacteria and therefore they have been used to assess the efficacy of therapies to control S. aureus infections in humans (Kokai-Kun, 2008). Gene expression profile was analyzed during the initial phases of the nasal colonization with a human isolate of S. aureus (Burian et al., 2010). Within the genes identified, S. aureus adhesin molecules (tagO, tarK, clfB and isdA) and virulence factors (walKR, sak, sceD) were fundamental for the nasal colonization of S. aureus (Burian et al., 2010). Based on the higher level of IgG against four S. aureus antigens, two iron-responsive surface determinants IsdA and IsdH were selected as vaccine candidates against S. aureus. In fact, S. aureus IsdA adhesin molecule is responsible for the binding to human squamous nasal epithelial cells and clumping factor B (ClfB), playing a complementary role in such binding. When tested in cotton rats, both antibodies raised against IsdA antigen conferred protection against nasal carriage (Clarke et al., 2006). Although the full protective mechanism is still not totally understood, this vaccination strategy may be a promising prophylactic tool in humans (Clarke et al., 2006).",

In the case of H5N1 avian influenza viruses, the guinea pig was also used as a model to investigate the origin of viral resistance in this species (Zhang et al., 2017). Interesting, at 1 day post infection the viral titer in the nasal wash and lung were already very low and proteomic profiling of the lung showed that more than 100 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were activated during the infection. Thus, unique and potent NALT and lung responses against H5N1 may confer protection against this virus in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs have also been intranasally infected with ZIKA virus (ZIKAV). Nasal infection with ZIKAV results in infection of the brain, parotid glands, tears, saliva and sera but NALT immune responses were not evaluated (Deng et al., 2017). Of interest, nasal vaccination of guinea pigs with a genital herpesvirus HSV2 vaccine results in protection to genital herpes and elicits systemic specific IgG but not IgA titers (Persson et al., 2016). Overall, guinea pigs continue to be used as models for the study of nasal pathogens and can illuminate mechanisms by which nasal vaccines confer protection at distant mucosal sites such as the vaginal tract. However, more detailed characterization of the local nasal immune responses against relevant human nasal pathogens in this species is still needed.",

Since then several \u201cmini-tissue\u201d have been reproduced successfully in many animals including human pancreas, kidney, thyroid, liver, inner ear, retina, skin tissue with follicular hair and brain (Barkauskas et al., 2017, Lee et al., 2018, Koehler et al., 2017, Orsini et al., 2018, Ramachandran et al., 2015, Turksen, 2016, Ueda et al., 2018).",

Although nasal organoids have been used for genotoxicity studies, their full potential has not been exploited to study human nasal diseases and host-microbe interactions at the human nasal mucosa. Due to the impervious and sometimes inaccessible airway anatomy, it is often difficult to determine the contribution of NALT in the cascade of events that lead to respiratory pathologies. Here, we propose the use of nasal organoids as a model for human nasal infections and other diseases, such as nasal polyps, rhinosinusitis, anosmia, allergy or aspergillosis. Organoids could also constitute a suitable model to study nasal-specific microbial interactions helping to identify virulence factors required for invasion and infection. Additionally, nasal organoids could shed light on potentially favorable competition between commensals and specific pathogens involved, for example, S. pneumoniae rhinosinusitis.",

Overall, nasal mucosal immune responses are not well understood compared to other mucosal immune responses. This is despite the large variety of pathogens that exploit the nasal route to gain entry to the host. Understanding nasal immunity in different animal models is vital for establishing models of human disease, but our current view of the diversity of nasal immune systems is patchy and reflects specific research efforts rather than unbiased comparisons. Although specific antibody responses following intranasal vaccination are a common readout in most animal experimental models as well as humans, very little is known about the early immune responses that halt pathogen entry or the contributions and cross-talk between d-NALT and O-NALT. Additionally, new insights in teleost fish suggest that nasal immunization triggers distant immune responses in the CNS suggesting tight neuroimmune regulation in the olfactory-CNS axis.",

Anatomically, the O-NALT of primates and farmed animals is the closest to human O-NALT, however these models also present their own limitations. Some of most refined animal models, such as the pig nasal influenza model, illustrate the importance of validating human disease symptoms, disease progression and immune responses in the laboratory setting. Further efforts are necessary to exploit the best attributes of each animal model and to translate laboratory findings into better therapies and vaccines that advance human health.",
