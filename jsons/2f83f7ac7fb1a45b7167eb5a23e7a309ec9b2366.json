Whether asymptomatic patients are contagious or not and whether they need medication are the arguments among clinical experts. Areas covered: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers. The patients were treated with four combinations of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets, arbidol tablets, Lianhuaqingwen granules, and recombinant human interferon-\u03b12b (IFN-\u03b12b) injection via aerosol. Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed. Expert opinion: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious. They improved obviously, after treatment with the quadruple therapy, but the effective drug is still unknown. It should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have many drug interactions and are the most likely drugs to cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in these two patients. IFN-\u03b12b is more effective in the early stage of virus infection. Arbidol instruction dose may not be sufficient to inhibit the novel coronavirus in vivo. The evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules for treating various viral infections is just based on Chinese patients.",

According to COVID-19 global cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), more than 2 million cases have been diagnosed worldwide, and over 190 thousand patients have died. The World Health Organization (WHO) listed the outbreak caused by COVID-19 as 'public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC).' This virus belongs to the same coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus but has higher replication ability, stronger interpersonal transmission ability, and higher pathogenicity. The population is generally susceptible, and there are numerous severe patients. However, after large-scale interpersonal infection, it is surprising that 'asymptomatic persons' appeared with no clinical symptoms, but pathogen detection is positive.",

Since the patient works as a bus driver, COVID-19 pneumonia cannot be ruled out, although he claimed no known contact with anyone from Hubei. The hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) immediately and designated him as a 'suspected person.' The patient was isolated in the hospital. His throat swab specimen was obtained for COVID-19 nucleic acid detection. On the same day, the local CDC confirmed that the patient's COVID-19 test was negative.",

Fifty-one percent of patients were suffered from chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, endocrine system diseases, digestive system diseases, respiratory system diseases, malignant tumors, and nervous system diseases. Elderly men with complications are more likely to be infected and may lead to serious or even fatal respiratory diseases [2] . Although the two patients in this paper were about 55 years old, they had good health and no basic medical history, which may be one reason why they had no obvious clinical symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, whether there are other possibilities need to be discussed and confirmed. For example, the male patient of the first case, saying no contact with Wuhan people, might be infected unconsciously by other people who got in touch with Wuhan people. After repeated reproduction and transmission, the virus is getting weak. Or, the viral load entering the body is relatively low; thus, under the condition of a good immune system, it will not emerge that large and rapid virus proliferation and migration in vivo lead to serious damage to lungs and even other organs. All these conjectures need further investigation. Asymptomatic cases are easy to miss diagnosis or misdiagnose, due to the lack of specific COVID-19 pneumonia manifestations and normal inflammatory indexes such as white blood cells, lymphocytes, and CRP. At present, there have been some asymptomatic cases in China, which should be paid attention to. It is worth noting that the first male patient in this paper, complaining of soreness of loins, is similar to the atypical COVID-19 pneumonia German patient with myalgias as a complaint [1] . The male patient of case 1 also showed transient elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase. With respect to muscle pain, there are similarities between asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 and influenza to some extent, and sometimes, the rise of serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and myoglobin can be seen. At present, the guidelines of COVID-19 pneumonia in various countries do not list muscle pain as one of the clinical manifestations, which may lead to the omission of some patients, especially the mild patients.",

This may be caused by two reasons, one is that asymptomatic patients may have a low viral load, and the other is that the detection rate of nucleic acid throat swab may be not high enough. For mild cases of COVID-19 infection, the use of lung imaging as a supplement or even an alternative to throat swab detection may also be an effective means to reduce the omission diagnostic rate. Under certain circumstances, lower respiratory tract specimens such as tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, and sputum, with higher viral load, can be tested to raise the detection rate. On the other hand, interpretation of positive results is equally important. At present, in China, two consecutive negative results of COVID-19 nucleic acid throat swab test are the necessary standard for patients to leave the hospital. In this paper, the female patient has no symptoms all the time, but the duration of positive nucleic acid test results is longer than that of the male patient, so she cannot be discharged from the hospital for a longer time. That provokes questions that how long the course of antiviral treatment should be and whether the sign of stopping antiviral treatment should be the clinical manifestation or nucleic acid turning negative. What is worth thinking about is whether it is a better choice for asymptomatic patients to rest at home instead of medication at hospital in order to prevent adverse drug reactions, such as the increase of triglyceride in cases 1 and 2 as described below. In this paper, two patients were treated with quadruple therapy combining Chinese and western medicines. COVID-19, SARS, and MERS belong to the same coronavirus, and their protein structures have many similarities. The antivirus drugs used in this paper have been proved to have an inhibitory effect on SARS/MERS in vitro or in vivo, but their adverse reactions and efficacy/safety in special populations such as liver and renal insufficiency still need to be paid attention to by clinicians.",

            "text": "Lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended by the National Health Commission of China for the treatment of COVID-19 at present [3] . Lopinavir is used to prevent the HIV gag-pol polyprotein from splitting. The action site of ritonavir is aspartyl protease of the virus, blocking the precursor of HIV gag-pol polyprotein. The two components work together, resulting in immature virus particles without regeneration capability. Moreover, ritonavir is also an enhancer of lopinavir, which can inhibit the CYP3A-mediated degradation of lopinavir in the liver [4] . Two SARS-based clinical studies [5, 6] and a MERS-based clinical case report [7] suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir has an anticoronavirus effect. In addition, lopinavir/ritonavir was listed as a candidate therapeutic drug in an anti-MERS guideline written by clinical experts in South Korea [8] . These studies are of great significance for the treatment of COVID-19 with lopinavir/ritonavir. However, the clinical studies on SARS published by Chan and Chu both pointed out that lopinavir/ritonavir as the initial treatment can remarkably improve the total mortality rate, oxygen saturation reduction rate, intubation rate, or glucocorticoid usage. But for treating the terminal stages, there was no obvious curative effect [5, 6] . This may be because lopinavir/ritonavir mainly acts by inhibiting the formation of new virus and cannot prevent the virus from entering cells, but numerous viruses have entered cells in the endstage patients, causing organ damage and poor outcome.",

In this paper, the triglyceride and fasting blood glucose levels of the two patients exhibited a huge rise far above normal after treatment. According to Naranjo's adverse drug reaction probability scale score, 5 points were obtained, indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir probably caused adverse reactions of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in both the patients. The adverse drug reactions may be common in patients because these two patients, as good representatives, had normal basic monitoring indexes and good liver/kidney function and physical condition and took lopinavir/ritonavir in a short time, thus metabolized and excreted lopinavir/ritonavir efficiently. For severe patients with liver function injury, risk of the adverse drug reactions may become higher, possibly leading to serious consequences, including fat overload syndrome, pancreatitis, other pathogen infection, and even prolonged hospitalization or death for reasons other than COVID-19 infection. Besides, lopinavir and ritonavir, both inhibitors of CYP3A, may increase the plasma concentration of drugs metabolized mainly by CYP3A, such as amiodarone, fentanyl, and midazolam, commonly used in severe patients. The drug action time will prolong and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions may increase. Lopinavir and ritonavir also have certain inhibition effects on ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), but the effects of ABCB1 were only detectable in the presence of CYP3A, suggesting that the simultaneous use of ABCB1 substrates should also be cautious [9] .",

For severe patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, it should be noted that blood drug concentration of lopinavir showed a rapid increase in the patients with liver dysfunction [10] , suggesting the necessity of therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir. Therapeutic concentration of lopinavir was 3-8 mg/L, and toxic concentration was above 8 mg/L [11] . However, patients with renal insufficiency can continue to take lopinavir/ritonavir at the conventional dosage because the renal clearance rate of lopinavir and ritonavir is extremely low. Moreover, both lopinavir and ritonavir have strong protein-binding capacity, so hemodialysis will not affect their clearance greatly [12] . But lopinavir/ritonavir was reported to be strongly related to kidney impairment, so its potential nephrotoxicity should be concerned [13, 14] . There are few reports of old people treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, yet the lopinavir plasma level in the elderly seems to be higher than the recommended value [15] .",

IFN-\u03b1 has a broad antivirus spectrum. In addition, it can enhance the specific cytotoxic effect of macrophages and lymphocytes by regulating immune function and thereby stop the invasion and infection of the virus effectively.

It is found that IFN-\u03b12b used in this paper tends to have a relatively higher activity [16] . IFN-\u03b1 is mainly administered subcutaneously and intramuscularly, which is easy to cause influenza-like symptoms, myelosuppression, mental abnormalities, and other adverse reactions. Inhalation will not inactivate IFN-\u03b1 and can raise the lung concentration [17] . 3.0 \u00d7 10 6 IU/day is the minimum inhalation dose of IFN-\u03b1 that can induce biological effects without side effects [18] .

It can be said that quadruple therapy has a certain curative effect, but the possibility of spontaneous improvement cannot be ruled out, and it is impossible to tell whether one or more drugs work. The reason why the two patients were selected is that they were the only asymptomatic patients in Northern Fujian Province of China, and their medication was analyzed by the authors, who often discuss difficult cases in the form of multidisciplinary team. The treatment of two patients met the guideline for COVID-19 pneumonia of China and got the ethical approval of relevant hospitals. This paper has limitations.
