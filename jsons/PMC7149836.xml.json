These organizational models influence health care system formulation in both developing and developed countries, as well as for countries restructuring their health services. Health care systems and financing are under pressure everywhere, not only to assure access to health for all citizens, but also to keep up with advancing medical technology, and contain the cost increase at sustainable levels. Because a health system is judged by more than its cost and measure of medical services, indicators of health status of the population, as well as morbidity and mortality are vital and should be available for the public through community organizations and the media. This topic has developed a complex terminology of its own. The World Health Organization (WHO) helps development of national health systems as shown in Box 8.3\n.\nBox 8.3WHO Definition, Rationale and Content of Health SystemsUniversal health coverage is defined as ensuring that all people have access to needed health promotion, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health services, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that people do not suffer financial hardship when paying for these services.\u2022Good health is essential to sustained economic and social development and poverty reduction.\u2022Access to needed health services is crucial for maintaining and improving health.\u2022At the same time, people need to be protected from being forced into poverty because of the cost of health care.\u2022A well-functioning health system working in harmony is built on having:Trained and motivated health workers;A well-maintained infrastructure;A reliable supply of medicine and technologies;Backed by adequate funding;Strong health plans;Evidence-based policies.\n\nWHO assists in creating resilient health systems by supporting countries to:\u2022\u201cDevelop, implement, and monitor solid national health policies, strategies and plans.\n\u2022\nAssure the availability of equitable integrated people-centered health services at an affordable price.\n\u2022\nFacilitate access to affordable, safe, and effective medicine and health technologies.\n\u2022\nStrengthen their health information systems and evidence-based policy-making, and to provide information and evidence on health-related matters.\u201d\nSource: World Health Organization.

In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, monasteries and nunneries provided charitable care to the poor while professional guilds provided prepaid medical care and other social benefits to members and their families. These later evolved into the Friendly (benevolent) Societies, as mutual benefit programs that provided for burials, pensions, and payment for health services for members. In the twentieth century, these developed through collective bargaining into health insurance plans through private or professionally sponsored insurers, and labor union\u2013sponsored health plans. Governmental responsibility for health systems evolved in public health and health protection systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and continues to evolve to face new challenges as well as preventive and treatment capacities.",

Following failure of the 1848 revolution he entered political life as a conservative. He became a prominent hero in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and unified the German Confederation becoming Chancellor from 1871 to 1890. Despite his aristocratic roots and deep political conservatism, Bismarck created Europe\u2019s first modern welfare state in the 1880s, establishing national health insurance for workers and their families (1883), accident insurance (1884) and old age pensions (1889). While his motivation may have been political\u2014to stem the rising popularity of socialist parties\u2014it also served nationalistic purposes to develop healthier children as future workers and soldiers. His legacy of employment-based social insurance for the health of workers and their families is widely emulated and remembered to this day as the \u201cBismarckian model\u201d of national health insurance built on the principles of solidarity, self-governance and competition. The Bismarckian model established state social insurance with prepayment by workers and their employers. It utilized Sick Funds (Krankenkassen) as insurers to provide payment to the physician, hospital, or other provider.",

Since 2009, Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) has been mandatory for all citizens and permanent residents pay a uniform contribution of 15.5 percent of their income (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) with 118 sickness funds (Krankenkassen, January 2016). SHI covers 85 percent of the population, who have the right to choose their preferred sickness fund for a comprehensive range of services. The sickness funds are linked to associations of physicians accredited to treat patients covered by SHI. Private health insurance (PHI) covers 11 percent of the population for designated groups such as civil servants. Others (4%) such as the military are included in other specific governmental programs. Since the 1990s financial incentives are being introduced to improve quality and efficiency of care along with beneficiaries right to choose between sickness funds increasing competition and a market orientation. Hospitals are paid by diagnosis related groups (DRGs)\u2014i.e., payment by diagnostic category rather than hospital length of stay, adopted from US experience. Physicians are paid by a capitation system\u2014i.e., a fixed payment for each person registered for care with a doctor for a fixed period of time (as opposed to fee-for-service) in the doctor\u2019s medical associations. Long-term care is covered by a federal mandatory program. Germany expends 11.3 percent of GDP (2015) on health, one of the highest levels among EU members, with 73 percent from public sources and 27 percent privately sourced. In 2014, Germany had 6.2 acute care beds per 1,000 beds per 1000 population, nearly 40 percent above the rate for the original EU countries (3.8 per 1,000). Of these, 48 percent of beds were in publicly owned, 34 percent in private nonprofit, and 18 percent in private for-profit hospitals. Busse et al. (2017) describes reforms since its founding in 1883 gradually achieving universal coverage. The system is also seeking greater cost effectiveness as compared to neighboring countries.",

In 1911, initiated by Lloyd-George, influenced by the German compulsory health insurance scheme, the Liberal government of Great Britain introduced the National Health Insurance Act. It was compulsory for all wage earners between 16 and 70 years of age. This was a two-part plan based on a worker and employer contributory system for both unemployment insurance and for medical care for workers and their families. Administration was through approved mutual benefit societies (the Friendly Societies), some based on insurance companies, and others by professional associations and trade unions. General practitioner services were paid on a capitation basis rather than a salary, preserving their status as self-employed professionals. Initially this plan covered one-third of the population increasing to half by 1940, however there was disruption due to mass unemployment during the Great Depression starting in 1929 and continuing to the late 1930s.",

During World War II, at the behest of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Beveridge developed a postwar social reconstruction program. The Beveridge Report of 1942, Social Insurance and Health Services, outlined the concept of a future welfare state including a national health service, placing medical care in the context of general social policy for the total population.

The National Health Service (NHS) Act was instituted in 1948 under the leadership of Aneurin Bevan, against continued opposition from medical organizations, as a universal state health service in Britain. The NHS provides a nationally tax-based financed, universal coverage system providing free care by general practitioners, specialists, hospitals, and public health services. This includes diagnosis and treatment of illnesses at home or in hospital, including dental and optometric care. The original NHS structure was divided into three separate services: hospital, general practitioner, and community health services. The hospital and specialist services were under the authority of 14 regional boards. General practitioners worked under national contracts, and community health services, such as public health, home nursing and health visitors, midwives, maternal- and child care, came under the control of the county and city local authorities. All units reported to the minister of health and his staff. The hospital bed supply in the UK in 2014 was just under half the rate in France and one third of the rate of beds in Germany per 1,000 population. Hospital based specialists are salaried but highly independent; general practitioners ran their own practices and provided the foundation of the NHS system. Over time, this tripartite structure evolved to some degree of integration of GP and community health services, along with hospitals under Hospital Trusts reporting to Regional Health Authorities. The NHS, with periodic reforms, is still in place in the UK and well accepted by the population and\u2014over time\u2014even by conservative governments and by the medical profession.",

Regional disparities in health indicators still exist despite changes in funding giving greater resources within regions (north-south divide) of England; each of the four has their own, policy directions. Social class and geographic inequities in health within the NHS have been recognized since the 1970s with a series of reports and analyses showing large gaps in life expectancy, avoidable (i.e., preventable) mortality between the south and north of England and even more so with Scotland and significantly poorer health indicators. The Marmot Report on inequalities from 2010 indicated the scope of the problem: \u201cPeople living in the most deprived neighborhoods will on average die seven years earlier than people living in the richest neighborhoods. Even more disturbing, people living in poorer areas not only die sooner, but spend more of their lives with disability\u2014an average total difference of 17 years.

The English NHS and other government agencies see the problem more broadly and adopted poverty-fighting measures with some success in improving mortality and morbidity social and health disparities since 2000. The NHS system remains generally popular in providing health security for all, and reaching good outcome measures despite regional inequities.

As a result, health promotion became a feature of Canadian public policy, with the objective of changing personal lifestyle habits to decrease cross-cutting risky behaviors such as smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. The pioneering work in nutrition from the National Nutrition Survey published in 1971 led to the adoption of federal mandatory enrichment regulations for basic foods with essential vitamins and minerals.

This was later extended to include organized union groups such as municipal employees and garment industry workers. PGP became best known in the Kaiser Permanente network developed for workers of Henry J. Kaiser Industries, at the Boulder Dam and Grand Coulee Dam construction sites in the 1930s. Kaiser Permanente health plans now provide care for millions of Americans in many other states. Initially opposed by the organized medical profession and the private insurance industry, PGP gained acceptance by providing high-quality, less-costly health care.

The objectives and specific targets included: reducing poverty, improving equal access of boys and girls to primary education, reducing child and maternal mortality, managing significant diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, along with improving the environment. Reaching the targets for achieving these goals depends on developing infrastructures of health systems that provide access for all and distribution to meet geographic and social inequities in health. Each country needs to develop its own system, but can learn from the experience of others. The purpose of this case study is to highlight the unique and common features, including positive and negative lessons learned from national health systems. Observing and learning can help in defining needs for countries lacking but aspiring to achieve universal health systems, including positive and negative challenges.",

Universal access systems have been achieved in most industrialized countries. However, the US has not achieved this goal even with, by far, the highest health expenditures of OECD countries. This is due mainly to political gridlock despite success with its single payer system for Medicare for the elderly. For low-income countries, the rates of health expenditures at present and forecast for the coming decades will be insufficient to achieve universal access systems. There must be a fundamental political change in national policies with health as a higher priority for funding and leadership. Universal healthcare access is still a work in progress.",
