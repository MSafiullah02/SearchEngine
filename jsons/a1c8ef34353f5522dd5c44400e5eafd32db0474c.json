            "text": "T he SARS-CoV-2 virus, more commonly known as coronavirus 2019 (COVID- 19) , is a novel respiratory virus that was first recognized in China and has now spread across the world. Existing literature has described the clinical presentation of COVID-19 to be similar yet distinct from prior comparable coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome. 1 COVID-19 appears to have a lower case fatality rate but a higher rate of transmission, leading to far more total deaths. 1, 2 Severe disease is notable for hypoxic respiratory failure requiring prolonged supportive care oftentimes involving intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. 3, 4 In the United States, the rapid transmission of the virus, which can also be spread by asymptomatic individuals, has led to a sharp increase in infections in a short period, straining the health care system. Of significant national concern is the limited supply of mechanical ventilators and the number needed to adequately satisfy the demand from the US population. 5 However, risk factors associated with the need for mechanical ventilation among those infected with COVID-19 are unclear. While preliminary reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that .70% of hospitalized patients have 1 underlying health conditions, only 5.8% of reported cases contain information on comorbidities. 6 Moreover, the relative importance of different underlying health conditions and sociodemographic factors in the disease course have yet to be determined from currently available studies due to inadequate adjustment for possible confounding factors. 7 As COVID-19 infections continue to rapidly consume the US health care system's limited resources, identifying populations at risk of a more severe disease course is critical for otolaryngologists, who may be called on to manage the airway of patients with COVID-19 in the hospital or decide which intubated patients are candidates for a tracheostomy. In this study, we aimed to identify individual risk factors associated with intubation among hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the Chicago metropolitan area, as well as time to extubation among intubated patients.",

Most large cohorts of patients with COVID-19 reported in the literature were based on Chinese and Italian populations, which previously had the most infections, although reports detailing the American experience have recently begun to emerge in Seattle, California, and New York. 4, [9] [10] [11] [12] The rate of intubation in our study was 28.4%, which is within the range of previous studies. In China, 12% of hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation, while in New York 12.2% to 33.1% of inpatients infected with COVID-19 were intubated. 4, 11, 13 In our Chicago cohort, daily intubations for patients infected with COVID-19 gradually increased in March until peaking on March 27, 2020, which was 6 days after stay-at-home orders were announced in Illinois. The subsequent decline in daily intubations was likely related to the implementation of local mitigation policies. About a third of intubated patients were intubated upon presentation in the emergency room, a sign of the rapid clinical deterioration experienced by a subset of patients infected with COVID-19. 4 Intubations were less frequent with each additional day that the patient was in the hospital, suggesting that the prognosis for a severe disease course may be determined within the first few days of admission. Once intubated, only 27.5% of patients were intubated for \\7 days, while 90% had a hospital stay .10 days. Identifying and treating at-risk patients early in the infection may provide benefit in preventing disease progression.",

COVID-19-induced reduction of ACE2 (angiotensinconverting enzyme 2), which regulates inflammation and is already present in lower levels in the elderly, has been proposed as a possible mechanism leading to higher disease severity. 16 ACE2 is also a component of Leydig cells within the male testes, leading to a potential site of infection and viral safe harbor, which may contribute to the higher percentage of male patients with COVID-19 as compared with females. 17 However, further investigation is necessary to elucidate how age and sex influence clinical presentation.",

Obesity is already associated with decreased pulmonary function, and with the addition of COVID-19 injuring lung tissue, adequate ventilation would inevitably become more difficult. 22 Biologically, obesity is also associated with higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, which may be exacerbated by the release of TNF-a and IL-6 from infected pneumocytes and pulmonary cells. 23, 24 Race and ethnicity were collected by self-report.

Open tracheostomy has a high risk of transmission of COVID-19 to health workers, as it is an aerosol-generating procedure. Several guidelines and checklists have been developed to protect otolaryngologists from infection during these procedures. [28] [29] [30] However, the optimal timing of tracheostomy in the COVID-19 population and whether there is any benefit to an early tracheostomy as seen in other diseases are unknown at this time. 31 In our study, most deaths occurred within 2 weeks of intubation, and many patients continue to remain intubated beyond 2 weeks. A portion of these patients will very likely need tracheostomies for long-term ventilation and weaning from ventilation. The timing and outcomes of tracheostomy in the COVID-19 population require further study.",

First, several patients in this study were still hospitalized at the time of last follow-up; as a result, some clinical outcomes were not known, such as mortality. Second, deciding when to intubate a patient is a complex clinical decision based on many factors, and different health care providers may have different criteria for deciding when to intubate patients with COVID-19. While this study included patients treated at several hospitals, the results might not be generalizable to other institutions. Third, laboratory results were not collected and could contribute as additional predictive factors for intubation and prolonged intubation. Fourth, although data were derived directly from medical records, they were originally collected for clinical care and thus suffer from rapidly evolving practice guidelines, which may lead to bias. We utilized several statistical methods to reduce bias and confounding effects. Last, the retrospective design of this study precludes the ability to draw causal conclusions.",
