The Accula SARS-CoV-2 POCT (Mesa Biotech, Inc., San Diego, CA) is a sample-to-80 answer nucleic acid amplification test that can yield a diagnostic result within 30 minutes of 81 specimen collection. This test uses RT-PCR to target the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene, and is 82 read out via lateral flow (Figure 1) (14) . The manufacturer's instructions are comprised of the 83 following steps: collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, lysis of viral particles in SARS-CoV-2 84 buffer, transfer of nucleic acid solution to a test cassette which contains internal process positive 85 and negative controls, reverse transcription of viral RNA to cDNA, nucleic acid amplification, 86 and detection by lateral flow. Due to biosafety regulations and hospital-mandated protocols for 87 sample collection at SHC, NP swabs were directly placed into VTM or saline at the patient 88 bedside after collection. Each test was performed at the laboratory, where a volume of 10 \u00b5L of 89 VTM or saline was transferred to 60 \u00b5L of SARS-CoV-2 buffer and added to the test cassette. 90",

Testing was repeated 92 once for invalid results on initial testing, and the second result was interpreted as final if valid. Although SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity has improved in many countries, a global shortage of 124 diagnostic infrastructure and consumable reagents has limited testing efforts. Point-of-care tests 125 offer the potential advantages of improved access to testing and reduced turnaround time of 126 results. Of the multiple EUA assays for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, only the Xpert Xpress, the ID 127 NOW, and the Accula are CLIA-waived (6). Recent data support the test performance of the 128 Cepheid Xpert SARS-CoV-2 assay, with agreement over 99% compared to high-complexity 129 EUA assays (8, 16, 17). In contrast, some studies have raised concern regarding the diagnostic 130 accuracy of the ID NOW, with positive percent agreement ranging from 75-94% compared to 131 reference assays (8-10, 18). Given the poor diagnostic performance of the ID NOW, and 132 uncertainty regarding availability of Xpert Xpress cartridges, the Accula system has been tauted 133 as an interesting POCT alternative but data were previously lacking on its clinical performance. 134",

Furthermore, reagents and kits have been limited, which limits POCT capacity. 142",

In individuals with moderate to high 147 pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2, reflex testing of negative samples on a separate EUA assay 148 should be performed. Education of health care professionals on the limitations of SARS-CoV-2 149 POCT should also be implemented to ensure optimal interpretation and management of negative 150 results. 151",

First, NP swabs were placed in VTM or saline at the patient 153 bedside before loading the Accula test cassette, which may have decreased sensitivity by diluting 154 the viral inoculum. Although this is discordant with the best recommended practice by the 155 manufacturer, it is in line with the practice at multiple institutions with clinical laboratories that 156 have assessed SARS-CoV-2 POCT due to biosafety concerns from risk of aerosolization (8-10, 157 18, 19). Second, it is possible that the use of saline instead of VTM led to poorer performance of 158 the Accula. However, aliquots from the same sample were used for parallel testing with the EUA 159 method, which minimizes sources of variation, and represents a pragmatic comparison given 160 widespread VTM shortages. Finally, the lateral-flow read-out of the Accula test is generally easy 161 to interpret; however, faint lines may be more challenging to interpret ",

Careful consideration should be given to balance the 166 potential advantages of rapid POCT to lower diagnostic accuracy. Individuals with moderate to 167 high pre-test probability who initially test negative on the Accula test should undergo 168 confirmatory testing with a separate EUA assay. 169 Acknowledgments 171 We would like to thank the members of the Stanford Health Care Clinical Virology Laboratory, 172 Department of Emergency Medicine, and Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious 173 Disease for their hard work and dedication to patient care. 174 Conflicts of Interest 179 The authors declare no conflicts of interest. 180 10.
