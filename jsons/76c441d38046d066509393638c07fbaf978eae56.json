            "text": "One way to identify important semantic predications is based on whether they have attracted a lot more attention than their peers from the scientific community. From a sociological perspective of scientific change (Fuchs 1993), researchers are driven by their competitions for recognition and reputation. A topic that attracts much attention from researchers is apparently considered important. The uncertainty associated with a high-attention topic must be also high-there must be a lot of potential to make high-reward discoveries or something that can dramatically boost one's recognition or reputation. Thus, competitions in high-profile and high-risk areas of research tend to be more intensive than other areas. In contrast, research areas with a low level of uncertainty are unlikely to sustain intensive competitions. The reasoning concerning attention, uncertainty, risk, potential reward, and ultimate recognition suggests that we may learn valuable insights from semantic predications that stand out in how long and how much of attention they have ever generated in scientific articles published in the past. Burst detection (Kleinberg 2002 ) is a generic algorithm that can be used to identify the level of attention as a type of burstness over time. If a semantic predication appears at a much higher level of frequency than other semantic predications within the same research domain, then intuitively, the semantic predication is having a burst. The duration in which a relatively high-level frequency is observed defines a duration of burstness. If multiple levels of frequency are observed in association with a semantic predication, then the predication may experience hierarchically related bursts. For example, a semantic predication concerning the semantic relation between virus and infection may have a level of frequency higher than some relatively rare diseases in the Semantic MEDLINE, thus, the predication may have a long period of relatively low-level burstness. From time to time, the semantic predication may have an even higher level of frequency, e.g., when particular types of virus, such as HIV, H1N1, and SARS are involved. CiteSpace provides a simple user interface for applying the burst detection to semantic predications ( Fig. 8 .5). The user can specify the semantic types of semantic predications. In the following example, causal relations such as CAUSES, AFFECTS, INHIBITES, DISRUPTS, PRODUCES, and PREVENTS are specified. Parameters for the burst detection model are set so that a burst must last at least for three consecutive years between 1914 and 2014, a 101-year time span.",

            "text": "Kleinberg's algorithm found 167 qualified semantic predications. Figure 8 .6 illustrates some of the earliest ones. These predications are considered particularly important by scientists who publish in biomedicine. The darker blue bars depict the period in which a semantic predication appears in MEDLINE for the first time. Each red bar depicts the duration of a burst, which is a period in which the frequency of the occurrences of the predication is considerably higher relative to that of other predications at the same time. The overall profile of the red lines suggests that (1) the burstness of a predication tends to shift over time and (2) the burstness of a predication becomes relatively short except the first few long-lasting ones. Thus, the immediate conclusion is that researchers' focus changes over time. This observation can be used as the basis of detecting emerging topics at a large scale. Table 8 .10 shows a more selective group of semantic predications that have the strongest bursts (burst strength > 10.0) among the 167 predications with bursts. The earliest predication, Virus CAUSES Influenza, first appeared in 1918, which would immediately remind us the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu. A particularly strong burst, highlighted in Table 8 .2, is found with the HIV => Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome predication, which first appeared in 1984 and started to burst for 10 years from 1991 to 2000. The strongest burst belongs to the predication Human Papillomavirus => Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri, which first appeared in 1986. It didn't burst until 26 years later in 2011. It is worth noting that the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2008 1 was awarded to Harald zur Hausen for his discovery of \"human papilloma viruses causing cervical cancer\" and the other half of the prize was awarded jointly to Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier for their discovery of \"human immunodeficiency virus\"-the HIV.

Scientific claims surrounded by cues that indicate the involvement of incomplete, conflicting, and contradictory information point to areas of research where the uncertainty is high and the competition is likely worthwhile. Funding agencies' decisions on high-risk and high-reward research are often revealing in terms of how people make decisions involving a significant degree of Table 8 .10 Semantic predications with burstness strengths > 10.0 from top 167 ones with bursts. '=>' denotes CAUSES uncertainty. Wagner and Alexander (2013) evaluated the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) program of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). SGER was a 16-year program operated from 1990 until 2006. The program was designed to serve as a special funding device to support high-risk and high-reward research that is unlikely to get funded through the traditional evaluation system. Citation counts, expert interviews, and the results of a survey all indicate a successful SGER. On the other hand, the evaluation of the program reveals that the NSF program directors were perhaps overly conservative-they spent far less than the allowable funds that were ear-marked for exploratory research. The program directors remained risk averse even with a program particularly designed to encourage transformative research. Similarly, Laudel and Glaser (2014) studied links between epistemic properties and institutional conditions for research based on projects funded by the European Research Council (ERC). They found that research that is important for the progress of a field is difficult to fund with common project grants. The conventional funding mechanisms appear to discourage unconventional research across all disciplines.",

Figure 8 .7 is a log-log plot of predicates found in the no conflict set (x-axes) against their frequencies in the conflict set. The size of a node represents the frequency of the corresponding predicate. Predicates in dark red are those involved in causal relations, such as TREATS, AFFECTS, and CAUSES, whereas those in light red are involved in structural or ontological relations, such as PROCESS OF, IS A, and PART OF. The line divides predicates into two parts. Predicates above the line, such as, TREATS, AFFECTS, and PREVENTS, appeared more often in the conflict set, whereas predicates below the line appeared more often in the no-conflict set, such as CAUSES, INHIBITS, and DISRUPTS. In both groups, predicates of causal relations are dominating the overall semantic predications. The conflict set appears to have more active or positive predications, i.e., the A causes B pattern. In contrast, the no-conflict set appears to have more passive or negative predications, i.e., the A suppresses B pattern. Figure 8 .7 also shows that the conflict set contains relatively more semantic predications with the semantic types such as PROCESS_OF, IS_A, ASSOCIATED_WITH, and USES as well as TREATS, AFFECTSS, and other types of relations. The division suggests the richness of the conflict set and the overall significance of the research topics that are intrinsically more essential to research.",

The largest connected component (LCC) of the network contains 331 concepts, or 92% of the entire network. The modularity of the network with respect to the partition by its clusters is 0.4125, which is in the middle of the range. The average silhouette of the network is relatively low at 0.267, which means the heterogeneity of a cluster is generally high. In other words, the diversity of predications in a given cluster is relatively high. Figure 8 .10 depicts a visualization of the largest connected component of the network without applying any link filters. Each semantic predication consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The subject and the object are represented by concepts defined in the UMLS metathesaurus. An UMLS concept is a term that represents a group of semantically equivalent terms. Each UMLS concept has a unique identifier CUI. In the virus example, HIV is an UMLS concept (CUI = C0019682). The HIV concept is used as the representative of 101 various kinds of semantically equivalent phrases found in text. Table 8 .15 shows some of the most commonly occurred terms in text. All of these terms are mapped to the UMLS concept HIV. In addition to the term HIV itself, terms such as Human immunodeficiency virus, HTLV-III, LAV, and HIV-1 are unified under the same UMLS concept HIV. There are 101 such terms identified as the subject of a predication and 268 such terms identified as the object of a predication. The mapping is done by SemRep, which we have introduced earlier.",

The visualization shown in Fig. 8 .18 has improved the clarity by pruning the excessive links from the network and preserving only the salient links through an algorithm called Pathfinder network scaling. The result of Pathfinder network scaling is called a Pathfinder network. Links in a Pathfinder network must meet a triangular inequality condition. Otherwise, links that fail to meet the conditions are removed from the network. In this way, the number of links is reduced while the integrity of the network is maintained by the condition. The triangular inequality condition requires that the cost or weight of a direct link between nodes n i and n j should not be greater than the total cost of an alternative path that connects the two nodes. Otherwise, the alternative path provides more insightful connections than the direct link. Therefore, it is justifiable to eliminate the direct link from the network.

Proposers are usually researchers who are visionary and creative. Novel connections that have the potential to broaden the current knowledge space are considered most valuable. The introduction of such new connections is likely to transform the state of the art of a scientific field. This stage may correspond to the first stage of Shneider's four-stage evolution model, i.e. the conceptualization stage. The key to the next stage is whether the novel connection can establish itself and attract enough followers to contribute towards the further development of the idea, including applying the original idea to a broad range of domains. This stage may partially correspond to the third stage of Shneider's model -the application stage. The structural variation functions in CiteSpace provide a concrete tool to identify the early sign of a potentially new conceptualization. It is The dashed lines in Fig. 8 .22 are novel connections. An article published in 1983 (PubMed ID: 6870184) is responsible for these potentially transformative links. Adding these novel links induced the largest modularity change rate of 15.25. The global structure of the new network is significantly different from the network prior to the addition of these links. This is very useful information for the conceptualization stage.

Figure 8 .25 shows the result of a structural variation analysis (Chen 2012) . The semantic predications are selected from those appeared between 1990 and 2014 in 3-year intervals. Top 100 most popular semantic predications per time interval are included. The nodes of the network consists of UMLS concepts that appeared as the subject or the object of a semantic predication, such as HIV and AIDS. Connections between concept nodes are determined by semantic predications. For instance, given the predication HIV CAUSES AIDS, the concept nodes HIV and AIDS are connected in the network with a semantic link CAUSES.",

            "text": "The network is then divided into clusters of sub-networks based on the connectivity in the network such that concepts within the same cluster are tightly connected by semantic predications, whereas concepts between distinct clusters are loosely connected at most. In addition, Pathfinder network scaling is applied to the network, which means links that do not meet the triangle inequality condition imposed by the Pathfinder network scaling algorithm will be removed. The resultant Pathfinder network preserves the links that satisfy the triangle inequality condition, which make the remaining structure more representative of salient semantic predications. Each cluster is labeled by the most representative concept selected by log-likelihood ratio tests in CiteSpace. For instance, Cluster #3, labeled as hiv and located near the upper right of the diagram, contains concepts such as hiv, human immunodeficiency virus, cmv, aids, retrovirus, hiv-1, and infections. Cluster #4, labeled as infectious mononucleosis and located in the mid-right area, contains concepts such as Epstein-barr virus (ebv), adenovirus, herpesvirus, and kaposis sarcoma. Dashed lines linking concepts in distinct clusters depict novel or unprecedented semantic connections at the time they appeared in MEDLINE. Such novel cross-cluster semantic connections are considered to have transformative potentials (Chen 2012) . Figure 8 .26 shows novel semantic links between distinct clusters made by a MEDLINE article published in 2004 (PMID: 14766405) . This article yielded a modularity change rate of 7.63, which is significantly high. It has 14 transformative links and a centrality divergence of 0.04. These structural variation metrics indicate that since the semantic predications made by the article connect distinct clusters, there is a significant boundary-spanning potential. A boundary-spanning mechanism is considered as one of the most common types of scientific discoveries (Chen 2011) . Figure 8 .27 shows annotations of the six semantic predications extracted from the MEDLINE article (PMID: 14766405). The first five predications are positive causal relations. The last one is a negation; however, the assertion is in the context of animals rather than humans, which is an important distinction that should have been preserved to avoid potential contradictions if one works on the level of extracted predications only. Furthermore, the strength of a semantic connection can be estimated based on how often the particular semantic type appears out of all the possible types connecting the two concepts. For example, the strongest link among the six relations is the first one (0.3707), followed by the third (0.1602) and the fifth (0.1454). The negation is the weakest (0.0550).",

Figure 8 .28 shows the burstness of the concept Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in Cluster #4 of the network. Prior to the burst that started in 1992, the concept already appeared in the dataset with an average of 10 appearances each year in the first few years of the 1980s. The annual frequency jumped from 21 to 34 when its burst was detected. Since the concept is a major node in Cluster #4 given the font size of its label, the burst of the concept may indicate the emergence of Cluster #4 to a new level. Combining with the burst of semantic predications, one can explore the dynamics of research from different perspectives at multiple levels of granularity.",

The brokerage role is likely to transform the organizational structure of the underlying domain.",

If more and more articles follow up and reinforce this Table 8 .20 Semantic predications extracted from the article with five transformative links (PMID: 9989205) pattern, one can imagine that the separation between the two clusters would diminish and eventually the two currently distinct clusters may merge into a single cluster.",

In addition to count the number of transformative predications, one can inspect transformative changes measured by metrics such as the modularity change rate, cluster linkage change rate, and the relative entropy of the distribution of betweenness centrality. Different metrics are sensitive to different types of global structural variation. Figure 8 .40 shows the footprint of 1972 (PMID: 4340152) . This article has the highest modularity change rate of 7.83. It added two novel links-one is between gross virus and tumors and the other between gross virus and polyoma virus (dashed white lines) and reinforced the existing link between polyoma virus and tumor (solid purple line). Figure 8 .41 shows the footprint of a 2001 article (PMID: 1134302), which has the largest number of incremental links of five. Unlike a transformative link, an incremental link connects concepts that belong to the same cluster. According to the structural variation theory, an article that essentially contributes incremental links is more likely to have its focus on some established research topics than articles that contribute transformative links. The article contributed semantic predications that connect concepts such as Kaposi's sarcoma and tumors, primary effusion lymphoma and tumors, kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and tumors. All these concepts belong to the largest cluster #0. The label of the cluster is centered on the centroid of the cluster near the lower right corner of the network.",

A novel idea may not materialize itself for a long time. A sufficient condition of transformative research is its acceptance by the relevant research community.

Since these indicators do not directly reflect the structure of a domain's knowledge, they are extrinsic measures of scientific change. In contrast, metrics derived from structural variations are intrinsic measures because they directly reflect the changes of the structure of a domain's knowledge. In next chapter, we will address a fundamental concept concerning the meta-knowledge, i.e. the knowledge of knowledge-the uncertainty of a scientific claim at a particular point of time. Take the predication that HIV causes AIDS as example. Our knowledge of what we know today may change drastically tomorrow. This is one kind of uncertain associated with our knowledge. We will discuss relevant issues in more detail in next chapter.",

The five dashed lines are novel links introduced by a 1999 MEDLINE article authored by Ellen Feigal (PMID: 9989205), entitled \"AIDS-associated malignancies: research perspectives.\" These novel connections are derived from the following statement in the article's abstract: \"The appearance in 1981 of a usually rare malignancy, Kaposi's sarcoma, in homosexual men [1] was one of the first harbingers of an epidemic caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\" More interestingly, these concepts belong to different clusters in the network. Linking concepts across different clusters draws our attention to this article's transformative potential. FEIGAL1999 is in fact a review article.
