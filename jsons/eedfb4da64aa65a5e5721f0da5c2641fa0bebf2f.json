When 2 viruses infect the same cell, genetic reassortment can occur with generation of new strains or subtypes. Such reassortment between human and avian virus strains gave rise to the influenza A pandemics of 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2), and, to some degree, 2009 (H1N1). Swine can be infected with both human and avian viruses, and thus serve as a mixing vessel facilitating emergence of new subtypes that may or may not readily transmit. Some highly pathogenic avian viruses (H5N1 and H7N9) have been transmitted directly from birds to humans, resulting in high mortality but, fortunately to date, low transmissibility. 2 In addition, mutations occur during routine replication that can lead to antigenic change in both influenza types A and B.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 714, "end": 715, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The unique ability of influenza viruses to change their genetic and antigenic makeup leads to annual epidemics of illness, hospitalizations, and excess mortality, as well as the continual threat of a new pandemic, with potentially higher morbidity and mortality.

Complications include febrile seizures in young children, sinusitis, viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and encephalopathy. Older adults may not present with fever, but rather with decompensation of underlying cardiac or pulmonary conditions. The main focus of influenza management is prevention through vaccination, and annual vaccination is now recommended for all persons older than 6 months. 4 Treatment When indicated, treatment should be begun as soon as possible, ideally within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Thus when suspicion is high, antiviral therapy should be administered without waiting for laboratory confirmation. 5 For severe disease, treatment may still be useful when initiated after 48 hours, and should not be withheld. The adamantanes, amantadine and rimantidine, block the influenza A M2 protein ion channel and thus prevent viral uncoating. However, because of widespread resistance, the adamantanes are no longer recommended for routine use. The neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, are active against both influenza A and B. Although resistance has been reported with oseltamivir, most viruses are susceptible at present.

This combination shortens assay time, reduces amplicon cross-contamination because the reaction tube is not opened, and allows visualization of amplification results as they are unfolding in real time. All steps can be performed in one room. Real-time PCR methods use nonsequence specific fluorescent DNA binding dyes such as SYBR Green or sequence-specific fluorescent DNA probes. Thus, real-time assays require the use of thermocyclers with built-in light sources, filters, and detectors. Assays using SYBR dyes gain their specificity through a melt-curve analysis wherein fluorescence is monitored with increasing temperature after completion of a certain number of cycles. The melting of double-stranded DNA occurs in a sequencespecific manner, and this is associated with a change in detectable fluorescence. One of the most common real-time PCR assays uses hydrolysis probes (eg, TaqMan probes) that contain a reporter fluorophore and quencher in close proximity. When the probe is intact, fluorescence from the reporter is quenched, but when the probe binds to a DNA segment undergoing amplification, the 5 0 -3 0 nuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades the probe, releasing the reporter from the quencher and leading to detectable fluorescence. For assays using this design, specificity is determined by both primer and probe sequences, and although a product may be amplified, mismatches in the probe might lead to failed hydrolysis and no detectable fluorescence.

Several studies have been performed to assess the clinical impact of rapid influenza testing, and these Several randomized studies compared triage-based protocol testing (ie, test results were available before the patient was seen) with standard care, and, although the results of these trials were mixed, they suggest that the availability of a rapid influenza test can decrease diagnostic evaluation, antibiotic utilization, and both the length and cost of visit in the emergency room. [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] Results were most pronounced for individuals testing positive for influenza, but not all studies performed this analysis, and trials were not necessarily powered to make these comparisons. All of these studies looked at only pediatric patients in an emergency room/urgent care setting. A recent meta-analysis of 5 studies recently concluded that RIDT use can reduce some diagnostic testing, but larger adequately powered studies are needed to fully address this issue. 62 Several nonrandomized studies included adults and inpatients and used chart review to compare individuals testing positive for influenza with those testing negative. [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] These studies found decreased antibiotic usage and reduced length of visit/length of stay among individuals testing influenza positive. In one study among hospitalized adults with cardiopulmonary disease, a positive RIDT led to reduced antibiotic use and increased antiviral therapy. However, several influenza-positive adults continued to receive antibiotics, leading the investigators to conclude that better tools are needed to exclude bacterial infections and further reduce antibiotic utilization. 64 Very few studies assessed whether rapid influenza testing availability or result affected the prescription of antivirals, which is likely due to the number of studies that examined only children. Two studies showed that antiviral prescriptions were appropriately increased among patients testing positive for influenza. 59, 64 No studies examined the impact of rapid influenza testing on bed-management decisions beyond admission to hospital or discharge from the emergency department in a systematic manner.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 633, "end": 637, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 638, "end": 642, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 643, "end": 647, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 648, "end": 652, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 653, "end": 657, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 658, "end": 662, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1134, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1305, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1315, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1320, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1325, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1831, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2152, "end": 2155, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2156, "end": 2158, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 142, "text": "Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "FACTORS TO CONSIDER"}, {"text": "All of the previously cited studies used either an RIDT or a 7-virus DFA for rapid testing, and studies of molecular tests are limited.
