SARS-CoV-2, the culprit virus, is highly contagious and stable in the environment and predominantly transmits among humans via the respiratory route. Accumulating evidence suggest that this virus, like many of its related viruses, may also be an enteric virus that can spread via the fecal-oral route. Such a hypothesis would also contribute to the rapidity and proliferation of this pandemic. Here we briefly summarize what is known about this family of viruses and literature basis of the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting the gastrointestinal tract and shedding in the environment for potential human-to-human transmission.",

Currently, no clinically approved specific antivirals, other therapeutic remedies, or vaccines are available for this disease. While spread of the virus among humans is predominantly through respiratory droplets, questions remain regarding other potential modes of transmission that may contribute to the initial crossspecies infection, a large number asymptomatic cases, and the rapid and unusual pattern of dissemination across the globe. In this review, we provide a summary of the molecular biology of the virus, evidence for its infection of cells within the gastrointestinal and hepatotropic/biliary tracts, and implications for potential fecal-oral transmission of the virus.",

Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic replication cycle of the virus. The initial attachment of the CoV to the host cell is mediated by interactions between the spike glycoprotein (S) and its cognate receptor. This molecular interaction is a major determinant of species, tissue, and cell tropism of a CoV. Many CoVs utilize cell-surface peptidases as their receptors, but the peptidase activity seems to be dispensable for viral entry 10 . Many alphacoronaviruses use aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) 11, 12 . In the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates entry into host cells [13] [14] [15] , whereas dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) is the receptor for MERS-CoV 16 . Of note, ACE2 is a X-linked gene and have sex-specific expression profiles 17 that may contribute to the observed more severe clinical manifestations in males over females with COVID-19 18 . Smokers and individuals suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have higher ACE2 expression level 19 . Innate immune signaling such as interferon (IFN) also seems to regulate ACE2 levels and thus susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection 20 . In the context   of the GI tract, patients with enteric virus infections and other inflammatory conditions may have a different cytokine profile and thus distinct ACE2 levels in the gut. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene have been associated with diabetes and hypertension 21, 22 .",

These data indicate that the receptor-binding domain of S binds tightly to human and bat ACE2, suggestive of a zoonotic origin. A recent study demonstrated that the virus can indeed be transmitted to cats (including a recent news of transmission to tigers in the Bronx Zoo) and ferrets, but not dogs, chickens or pigs 24 , although porcine ACE2 mediates viral entry in cell culture 14 . This broad species-tropism raises concerns of potential transmission from domestic pets to humans and vice versa. From a structural and immunogen design perspective, more information is needed regarding the native S protein trimeric state on virions, how the trimer interacts with ACE2, and how such interaction is disrupted by neutralizing antibodies. A recent publication on the crystal structure of an antibody in complex with the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein provides important molecular insight into antibody recognition of the virus and a potential strategy for vaccine development 27 . Besides ACE2, other potential entry factors such as CD147 28 and integrins 29 are currently under investigation.",

This aciddependent process may explain the proposed efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, as lysosomotropic agent, in the treatment of COVID-19 36 (Fig. 1 ). Recent publications suggest that similar to SARS-CoV, trypsin and TMPRSS2 also prime SARS-CoV-2 S protein for efficient infection 15, 37 . Overexpression of TMPRSS2 in African Green Monkey Vero-E6 cells significantly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity 38 .

But the elevations were mostly mild except for patients with more severe COVID-19 84 , who might be experiencing drug-induced or sepsis/shock-related liver injury. Limited post-mortem pathology of the liver of COVID-19 patients showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, which are nonspecific changes 85 . In a US-based study, serum aminotransferase levels were also not significantly altered in COVID-19 patients 86 . Further studies are necessary to define whether SARS-CoV-2 is indeed a hepato-or cholangiotropic virus that can cause direct liver injury or be secreted into the bile.",

Primary human intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes or cholangiocytes as well as donor-derived human intestinal enteroids 88 and liver organoids will be valuable models to study SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and replication. So far, there is one report of SARS-CoV-2 infection of cholangiocytes 49 Murine models would also help investigate the disease in vivo, such as potential intestinal and/or hepatic injury, effects on various digestive functions and interactions with gut and systemic immunity. Other larger animal models, such as ferrets 82, 94 , cats 93 , and macaques 81, 83, 95 , all recently shown to be infectible by SARS-CoV-2 with similar disease, will also be valuable models to study the biology of infection and testing of vaccine and drug therapies. Finally, host innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2, including IFN signaling 96 and the inflammasome related cytokines 97 , in particular those pathways at the mucosal surfaces 98, 99 , the short-and long-term adaptive immune responses against this virus, and how these antiviral activities vary in children, adults and the elderly, are largely unknown and fertile for future research.",

Whether the virus will persist in human populations with recurrent bouts of outbreaks, like influenza or other emerging infections, attenuate after accumulating mutations to the likes of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E common cold CoVs, or disappear after the primary outbreak, like SARS-CoV, remains a vital question for the coming year. Regardless of the answer, it is indisputable that future pandemic like this one, will likely occur again. We are at the crossroads of science, medicine and societal policies; our actions and commitments will profoundly shape the future of our world. For now, lessons learned from studying this virus, its infection modes, pathogenesis and disease manifestations will not only be invaluable for developing effective vaccines and therapies against this emerging disease but also prepare our world better for future pandemics. Other potential organs of involvement include intestine, hepatobiliary system, heart, kidney or central nervous system, many of which express high levels of ACE2, the main receptor for viral entry. Whether the virus can directly infect the intestine bypassing the respirstory system is unknown. Either way, the virus may infect, replicate and shed from the enterocytes and possibly hepatocytes/cholangiocytes and be excreted as fecal materials into the environment contaminating water and food supplies. The hypothesis that virus may either be directly transmitted to other humans via fecal-oral route, or infect household pets, like cats, or wildlife first before passing to humans, remains a key question to answer.",

Two other species of human CoVs (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) were isolated in the early 2000's. Since then, the human race has encountered three novel CoV outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012, and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2, all of which have jumped species from animals to humans and are associated with severe respiratory disease and high mortality. Zoonotic infections involving non-human species as intermediate hosts, such as invertebrate vectors, rodents, and bats, are common in nature 3 . But cross-species jumps from animals to humans with altered tropism as a result of genetic alterations are less frequent. At present, it is not clear what accounts for this seemingly increased pace of cross-species transmission of such virulent pathogens that can cause devastating disease in humans. Manipulation of the environment by mankind, increased human-animal contacts, and globalization may have facilitated conditions for cross-species infection 4 .

During the SARS outbreak, up to 76% of patients with SARS developed diarrhea, usually within the first week of illness 52 .Intestinal biopsy demonstrated active SARS-CoV replication within both the small and large intestines and infectious virus were isolated from intestinal tissue but not fecal specimens53 . In 2012, during the MERS outbreak, a quarter of patients with MERS-CoV reported GI symptoms including diarrhea and abdominal pain before the manifestation of respiratory symptoms 54 and active shedding of viral RNA could be detected in the stool of these patients although no infectious virus was recovered55 . MERS virus was shown to actively replicate in primary human intestinal enteroids and can be transmitted enterically to human DPP4 transgenic mice with replication in intestinal epithelium, enterocolitis and subsequence spread to to other organs 56 .Frequent liver involvement has also been reported in SARS and MERS infections, mostly with mild to moderate elevations of aminotransferases (<2X upper limit of normal)57 . Viral RNA and particles have been detected in the liver of SARS patients on autopsy 58 . Overall it is not clear whether liver injury is indeed the result of direct viral infection, inflammation-mediated damage or drug-induced injury. The majority of human enteric viruses, including rotaviruses, noroviruses, and astroviruses, are characterized by a non-enveloped, naked capsid 59 , that presumably can tolerate digestive enzymes and the harsh environment of gastric fluids and bile in the duodenum. This naturally begs the question: how can enveloped CoVs survive the low pH of the stomach and withstand the detergent effect of bile salts in the small bowel? Known enteric CoVs, like TGEV, may resist these harsh conditions by 1) heavy glycosylation of S protein, 2) evolving intrinsic resistance to low pH and digestive enzymes, 3) forming tight complex with mucins 60 . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are intrinsically capable of enduring harsh conditions: SARS-CoV is viable for up to 2 weeks after drying and up to 5 days in room temperature and low humidity 61 . MERS-CoV appears to be similarly hardy 62 . SARS-CoV RNA was detected in sewage of hospitals treating patients with SARS and the virus remained infectious up to 2 weeks in sewage water under experimental condition 63 . At least two recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a remarkably similar stability in the environment 64, 65 .",

Does SARS-CoV-2 actively infect human enteriods and intestinal epithelial cells in vivo? Are GI symptoms caused by viral replication in the enterocytes and its interaction with GI mucosal immunity? Are infectious viruses shed in the fecal samples and can they be recovered in a laboratory setting? If so, is the fecal viral load sufficiently high for human transmission? How long can the excreted virus persist in the environment, more specifically in the sewage system? Can fecally shedded virus infect animals that may serve as a reservoir for spread? During transmission, can gut be the first site of infection or does the virus spread to the gut from the respiratory or other tissues? Future research opportunities in COVID-19 From both clinical and public health standpoints, it is critical to fully understand the SARS-CoV-2's route of transmission. If high levels of infectious viruses are present in the intestinal lumen of infected patients, especially in asymptomatic patients, this poses risks during endoscopy and colonoscopy to gastroenterologists 87 , endoscopy personnel and other patients.
