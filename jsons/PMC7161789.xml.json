The prevalence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is pandemic in a number of countries including India and assumes a variety of clinical forms, ranging from a respiratory disease to infection of the oviduct leading to permanent damage to immature birds and in hens, leading to reduced egg production and a nephropathogenic form of IBV causing acute nephritis, urolithiasis, and mortality 1. IBV, a causative agent of AIB disease, belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus, subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 2011). The genome of IBV is a positive\u2010sense single\u2010stranded RNA of about 27.6 kb with the following genomic organization: 5\u2032\u2010Pol\u2010S\u20103a\u20103b\u2010E\u2010M\u20105a\u20105b\u2010N\u2010untranslated region\u20103\u2032 2.",

The spike gene is translated as a precursor spike So, which is posttranslationally cleaved by host serine protease into S1 and S2 at cleavage sequence motif 4. The S1 protein is the primary cause of antigenic variations in IBV and contains the serotype\u2010specific neutralization epitopes, whereas the envelope and membrane proteins are conserved. Antigenic variation among IBV strains is common 1, 5, 6, 7, 8; the major prevalent form of IBV in the Indian subcontinent is respiratory and nephropathogenic forms 9.",

            "text": "The IBV classification of different serotypes is based largely on virus\u2010neutralization tests, a gold standard test for serodiagnosis of infectious bronchitis in infected birds. Serotype determination is of trivial importance as different serotypes do not always cross protect. Genotyping of IBV strains can also be done by genetic characterization of the spike glycoprotein gene by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism, and nucleotide sequencing, which for the most part correlates with the viral serotype 10, 11. Nucleotide sequencing of the S1 gene is the foremost technique used for differentiation of IBV strains into various genotypes. The emergence of antigenic variants is mostly attributed to variation in the spike gene by recombination 12, 13 and is investigated by nucleotide sequencing of the S1 portion of the S gene coding for the S1 subunit 14, 15, where most of the epitopes to which neutralizing antibodies bind are found 16. The impact of regular emergence of antigenic variants of the disease and subsequent vaccines used to control varies depending on different geographical locations. Genetic assessment of field isolates of viruses from outbreaks is essential for evaluation of vaccine efficiency on antigenic variants that arise. A critical advantage of sequencing S1 is for comparison and analysis of sequences of unknown field isolates and variants with reference vaccine strains for establishing potential relatedness. IBV vaccines currently used are either live attenuated or killed showing varying degrees of efficacy. At present, many countries only permit live vaccines of the Massachusetts type, such as the H120 strain. Some countries have also licensed other live strain vaccine such as Connecticut, Arkansas, or Delaware 072 in the United States or the 4/91 strain in the United Kingdom. In India, Verma, 17 for the first time reported the prevalence of IBV infections in chickens. The emergence of a nephropathogenic IBV with a novel genotype in India has also been reported 9. Recently, an outbreak of nephropathogenic AIB in broiler flocks was reported in the Chhattisgarh region of India 18.",

However, common epitopes exist between isolates, which are of importance in cross\u2010immunity; some of these are likely to be on proteins other than S1. The degree of cross protection induced by UK/6/82 against homologous and heterologous IBV isolates diminished as the similarity of the S1 proteins diminished 12. In a study involving vaccination of birds with single vaccination with 6/82 failed to protect all chicks against isolates with extremely similar (>98% identity) S1 sequences, indicating that a slight change in the S1 sequence may have led to the failure of vaccine 12. The Indian IBV vaccine strain H120 showed 71.4%\u201396.9% homology at an amino acid level and 71.8\u201399% homology at a nucleotide level. So the degree of protection may be higher with homologous genotype compared to heterologous ones. It is presumed that the degree of cross protection between different serotypes is less, but some strains of the IBV viruses do induce cross protection against other serotypes and are known to as protectotypes. The H120 strain of IBV is a well\u2010known protectotype and has been extensively used for vaccination. To overcome the problem associated with different serotypes and genotypes, it has been reported that vaccinating with two different types of IBV vaccine can provide broad protection against different IBV types 5. A different combination of protectotypes can be tested to achieve a high level of cross protection and to overcome a problem of vaccination failure. The study involving the Indian vaccine strain Ma41 with 94.8%\u201398.8% homology to field isolates showed good cross protection 23. Other than spike, enhancement of humoral immunity against IBV by a bicistronic DNA vaccine plasmid encoding nucleocapsid protein and interleukin\u20102 has shown up to 80% of protection 24.",

The reported Indian IBV isolates have lost some of the N\u2010glycosylation sites (Table 4). As N\u2010glycosylation is a regular event in posttranslational modification of the protein, changes in a glycosylation pattern can modulate antigenic properties of the protein as antibodies raised against glycoprotein may be specific for a carbohydrate moiety of the glycoprotein 25. Diversification of the glycosylation pattern may influence a survival pattern and a transmission property of virus, in lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family; determinants of changes in virulence and cellular tropism of virus are loss or acquisition of N\u2010glycosylation sites of the protein 26.",

The cleavage recognition site consists of five basic amino acid residues, and variation in a sequence and composition does not correlate with serotype or pathogenicity of IBV as different serotypes as well as attenuated and pathogenic isolates contain the same cleavage recognition site that correlate with viruses of different geographic regions 21. The Indian vaccine strain KF188436, which belongs to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype, is shown to have an Arg\u2013Arg\u2013Phe\u2013Arg\u2013Arg cleavage recognition site, which correlates with isolates THA241251, THA280252, THA290252, and THA320352 of Thailand 21; FJ888351, GQ154655, and FJ888351 of China; and GU393335 of the United States. It shows that the H120 strain mostly has a RRFRR cleavage recognition site. LRR is a structural motif of protein like alpha/beta horseshoe fold and is responsible for protein==protein interactions 27, 28. In KF188436, LRR is present at position 1079 that is a part of the S2 protein and may be responsible for an interaction with other proteins of IBV.",

The vaccine strain used is sufficiently protective based on a similarity study but further in vivo cross protection studies should be carried out to check the cross protection potential of the current vaccine against field isolates.",
