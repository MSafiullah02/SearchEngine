The majority of states have followed with similar guidelines[1]. Although definitions of \u201celective\u201d or \u201cnon-essential\u201d surgery vary across guidelines and state mandates, almost all primary hip and knee arthroplasty procedures and most revision hip and knee arthroplasty procedures fall within the non-essential definition. The American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) have both voiced support for these measures and have provided information for their members to navigate these recommendations.",

The purpose of this study was to estimate 1) the number of primary hip and knee arthroplasty procedures canceled due to COVID-19 and 2) the number of revision hip and knee arthroplasty procedure canceled due to COVID-19 in order to better understand the effect of COVID-19 on hip and knee arthroplasty surgical volume in the US.",

Therefore, a literature review was performed to identify recently published studies that projected hip and knee arthroplasty volume for 2020. Four studies that projected hip and knee arthroplasty procedures volumes in the US for 2020 were assessed [3, 4, 5, 6]. These studies utilized various projection modeling algorithms and time periods of data to create hip and knee arthroplasty volume projections. Overall, the projected number of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures to be performed in 2020 ranged from approximately 775,000 to 1.4 million, and the projected number of primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures to be performed in 2020 ranged from approximately 460,000 to 512,000 depending upon the specific model utilized [3, 4, 5, 6]. Only one study provided projections for revision hip and knee arthroplasty procedures during 2020, with Kurtz et al. [6] projecting approximately 128,000 revision TKA procedures and 66,000 revision THA procedures to be performed in 2020. To best estimate the projected primary THA and TKA volume for 2020, the volume projections across these four studies were averaged for the various procedures, including their multiple projection models. These calculations resulted in an estimated 1,078,359 primary TKA and 495,140 primary THA to be performed in 2020.",

Although definitions for essential and non-essential surgical procedures are either not defined or vary across published guidelines [1], for the purposes of this study the following arthroplasty procedures were assumed to fall under a general definition of \u201cessential\u201d and thus would likely proceed despite COVID-19 restrictions: THA for hip fracture, periprosthetic fracture related revision TKA or THA and infection related revision TKA and THA. To estimate the number of these presumed essential hip and knee arthroplasty procedures for 2020, data from the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) was assessed [7]. According to the AJRR 2019 Annual Report, THA for fracture accounted for 2.7% of all primary THA procedures occurring from 2012 to 2018 [7]. Over this same time period THA revisions were performed for infection in 13.3% of cases, periprosthetic fracture in 5.4% of cases and fracture or fracture related sequalae in 4.3% of cases [7]. Similarly, from 2012 to 2018, TKA revisions were performed for infection in 20.5% of cases and fracture or fracture related sequelae 2.3% of cases [7]. These percentages were utilized to exclude \u201cessential\u201d cases from the 2020 volume projections to estimate the number of \u201cnon-essential\u201d hip and knee arthroplasty procedures that were projected to occur throughout 2020.",

These estimates were made by dividing the 2020 projections equally into the respective time periods. This strategy was felt to be valid after reviewing AJRR data to calculate the number of primary and revision hip arthroplasty procedures performed per month over the years 2018 and 2019. This analysis revealed the monthly procedural volumes varied slightly month-to-month with a range of 6.2% to 9.9% of total procedures occurring per month in 2018 (median: 8.8%) and a range of 5.5% to 10.3% of total procedures occurring per month in 2019 (median: 9.1%). In 2018, 8.9% of all hip and knee arthroplasty procedures occurred in April and 9.2% occurred in May. In 2019, 10.0% of all hip and knee arthroplasty procedures occurred in April and 10.3% occurred in May. Therefore, the monthly and weekly projections used here likely underestimate the number of procedures canceled due to COVID-19 as the majority of cancellations are likely to occur during the months of April and May.",

            "text": "These results highlight the profound impact COVID-19 is having on hip and knee arthroplasty patients as well as the medical institutions that care for them. Not only will institutions be hurt by the lost revenue from these canceled procedures but rescheduling approximately 130,000 primary and 12,000 revision arthroplasty surgeries will bring increased burden to an already struggling healthcare system. However, a predicted surge of rescheduling canceled cases is based upon the assumption that patients will want to reschedule their surgery, or new patients will want to be indicated for surgery, once restrictions from COVID-19 are lifted. It is unknown how a pandemic will impact a patient\u2019s willingness to proceed with hip or knee surgery in the near future. With the recent grim statistics regarding national unemployment, a sizable share of the population becoming recently unemployed or under-employed will undoubtedly influence the ability of patients relying on private insurance to undergo joint reconstruction procedures. As an illustrative example, following the economic downturn during 2008 and 2009, 30% of AAHKS surgeons reported a surgical volume decrease [8]. This data is supported the identification of a plateau in arthroplasty procedures performed in 2008 to 2009 by Kurtz et al.[6] that was thought to be attributed to the recessionary conditions during that time. These studies suggest that the current impact of COVID-19 on the US economy may have a similar impact on subsequent demand for hip and knee arthroplasty during the early period of reopening our healthcare system to non-essential surgery. However, it is important to note that the anticipated long-term trends for demand in total joint were not significantly impacted by recession in the late 2000\u2019s [6].",

First, the estimates were based upon projected 2020 hip and knee arthroplasty volume from other studies and are thus limited by the accuracy of those projections. However, we sought to minimize these limitations by averaging the 2020 primary hip and knee arthroplasty volume projections from four recently published datasets [3, 4, 5, 6]. Furthermore, it is likely that recommendations to cancel non-essential surgery were implemented over different time periods. However, given the timing of state and national recommendations [1] and the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that the majority of medical centers in the US will perform minimal primary hip and knee arthroplasty and very few essential revision procedures during the months of April and May of 2020 and thus we have provided both weekly and monthly projections to account for this and to provide as accurate projections as possible. Lastly, the true number of canceled hip and knee arthroplasty procedures will also greatly depend upon how long the COVID-19 pandemic lasts and when restrictions on non-essential surgical cases can be lifted. These will happen at various times across the country, as each city and state go through their own phase of the pandemic.",

The survey results indicated that 92% of hospitals have stopped elective inpatient surgery due to COVID-19 and 74% of responding surgeons are effectively not working due to institutional or self-imposed deferral of elective surgery [9]. These survey results suggest that our estimates from the 100% and 75% cancellation scenarios may be the most accurate projections for the number of cases canceled per week due to COVID-19. Furthermore, the AAHKS survey results indicated that essential surgery is still occurring throughout the US, with 64% of those who responded indicating they are still performing surgery for periprosthetic joint infection and 88% performing surgery for periprosthetic fracture [9]. These results also support our assumptions that infection and fracture related revisions would continue to occur as essential surgical procedures.",
