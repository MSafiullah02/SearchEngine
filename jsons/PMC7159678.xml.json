Persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness within 14 days after traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries should be evaluated according to current guidelines (available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html). Persons whose respiratory illness remains unexplained and who meet criteria for \u201cpatient under investigation\u201d should be reported immediately to CDC through state and local health departments. Persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness who are close contacts2 of a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness within 14 days of traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries may be considered for evaluation for MERS\u2010CoV. In addition, CDC recommends that clusters of severe acute respiratory illness be investigated and, if no obvious etiology is identified, local public health officials be notified and testing for MERS\u2010CoV conducted, if indicated.",

Specimens should be collected at different times after symptom onset, if possible. Lower respiratory tract specimens should be a priority for collection and PCR testing; stool specimens also may be collected. Specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions (available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html).",

FDA issued an EUA on June 5, 2013, to authorize use of CDC's novel coronavirus 2012 real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2013PCR assay (NCV\u20102\u201012 rRT\u2010PCR assay) to test for MERS\u2010CoV in clinical respiratory, blood, and stool specimens. This EUA is needed because, at this time, there are no FDA\u2010approved tests that identify MERS\u2010CoV in clinical specimens. This assay will be deployed to Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories in all 50 states over the coming weeks. Updated information about laboratories with the capacity to conduct MERS testing with the NCV\u20102\u201012 rRT\u2010PCR assay will be provided on CDC's MERS website (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html).",
