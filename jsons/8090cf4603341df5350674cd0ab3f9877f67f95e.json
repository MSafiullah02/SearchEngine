Viral growth was not inhibited by the presence of actinomycin D or 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine. MHV-2 was completely inactivated by ether, chloroform, sodium deoxycholate or betapropiolactone, but showed a moderate resistance to trypsin. Heating at 56 C for 30 min did not completely abolish the virus infectivity. The virus was stable after heating at 50 C for 15 min in 1 m-MgCl2 or 1 m-MgSO4 as well as at 37 C for 60 min at pH 3.0 to 9.0. Infectivity was decreased to 1/100 and 1/400 after storing at 4 C for 30 days and 37 C for 24 hr, respectively. The virus passed through a 200-nm but not a 50-nm Sartorius membrane filter. The buoyant density of MHV-2 was 1.183 g/cm3 in sucrose gradient, and the fraction contained coronavirus-like particles measuring 70 to 130 nm in diameter. Survival rate was 10% after exposure to ultraviolet at 150 ergs/mm2. Freezing and thawing or sonication at 20 kc for 3 min did not affect the virus titer. No hemagglutinin was demonstrable with red blood cells of the chicken, Japanese quail, mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, sheep, bovine or human.",

MHV can be grown in some cultured cells, but difficulty yet remains because available cell cultures are mostly primary ones. Thus, properties of MHV have been studied using virus from infected mouse livers without recourse to quantitative assays. Recently, the authors (21, 22) reported a satisfactory assay system using a cell line, SR-CDF1-DBT (DBT), that is permissible to MHV-2 virus (32) . By the use of this cell line, routine plaque assay can be readily made, and clearer results are obtained than by the use of other cell systems (19, 26) . The plaque forming units (PFU) obtained with DBT cells are in agreement with mouse pathogenicity (21) . This paper deals with determination of several essential physico-chemical properties of MHV-2 passaged more than 50 times through DBT cells using the assay system on DBT cells.",

Rowe et al (38) showed that a low-virulent strain, MHV-S, was isolated from feces of mice, indicating that enteric infection is possible, and this was supported by Calisher and Rowe (5) revealing a moderate resistance of MHV-S to SDC. Our results on MHV-2 were not compatible with those because MHV-2 was completely inactivated by 0.1 % SDC. However,0.01 % SDC did not affect the infectivity of MHV-2. As MHV-S virus is more resistant to SDC than MHV-2 (unpublished observation), the difference in resistance to SDC seems to concern with the enteric or hepatic pathogenicity of MHV strains. MHV-2 was completely inactivated by 0.4% BPL as reported by Hercules and Von Kaemel (20) . Some infectivity was retained after treatment with 1.0% trypsin at 37 C for 60 min.",

In general, many of envelopedviruses are labile at pH 3.0, while non-enveloped viruses, except for rhinovirus, are mostly stable. It is very interesting that enveloped MHV-2 was shown to be stable at pH 3.0 retaining 90% of infectivity even after incubation at 37 C for 60 min. This is compatible with the report of Piazza (36) who described that the infectivity of MHV-3 was not affected after storing at 37 C for 60 min at pH 2.5 to 9.5. Cartwright et al (6) demonstrated that the infectivity of a strain of TGEV was not lost after incubation at 37 C for 3 hr at pH 3.0 and Furuuchi et al (13) reported on the pH 3.0 stability of TGEV stating that the attenuated strain was inactivated completely within 2 hr but residual infectivity of the virulent strain was detected at 37 C up to 8 hr. Pensaert and Callebaut (34) also reported that HEV was stable at pH 3.0 at room temperature. In the case of IBV, Stinski and Cunninghum (40) reported that 92 to 96% of infectivity of Beaudette strain was still recovered after being allowed to stand at 4 C for 30 min at pH 3.0 and Cowen and Hitchner (8) demonstrated that stability at pH 3.0 is variable depending upon each strain of this ",
