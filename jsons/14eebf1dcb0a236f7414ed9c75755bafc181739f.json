Forty-two peptides among them were reactive to the sera from all three patients. Consequently, we tested for the reactivity of these 42 peptides to patients' sera (n \u00bc 45) at 6-month post-infection. The significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies specific to three (S791, M207 and N161) of 42 peptides were detectable in the post-infection sera from 23 (51%), 27 (60%) and 19 (42%) of 45 patients, respectively. These three peptides, recognized by their long-lasting immunity, may provide a better understanding of the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was discovered in association with the cases of life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that occurred in March of 2003 (1, 2). The genome of the SARS-CoV is 29,727 nucleotides in length and has 11 open reading frames, and its genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses (3). Since March of 2003, studies to determine immunogenic epitopes have been performed at a fast pace, within a short period of time, because of the urgent need to develop both therapeutic and diagnostic modalities for the SARS-CoV (4-8). The results of these studies indicate that both the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the SARS-CoV contain immunogenic regions. However,",

These peptides were tested for their reactivity to the sera of early stages of three Taiwanese SARS-CoV-infected patients by using flowmetry analysis with Luminex TM (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) (9) . The sera were collected from Jen-Ai Municipal Hospital, SaAn District, Taipei, Taiwan. The patients' sera showed significantly higher levels of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) (P < 0.05) activities reactive to 42 of 197 peptides tested, including 20 spike (S)-, seven membrane (M)-and 15 nucleocapsid (N)-derived peptides, when the means of the scores of fluorescence intensity (FI) from the sera (1000-fold dilution) of the three patients (closed bar) were compared to those of the three healthy donors (HD) (open bar). The peptides were coupled to colour-coded beads, according to the modified manufacturer's instructions (Luminex Corp.). In brief, 100 ml of colour-coded beads were mixed with 100 ml of peptide (1 mg/ml in 0.1 M morpholinoehanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH 4.5). The peptide-loaded beads were then incubated with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide 2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (EDC) (1 mg ml \u00c01 ) at room temperature for 30 min in darkness, and the beads were washed with Tween-20 phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The beads were treated with 2-aminoethanol for 10 min at room temperature in darkness, washed twice and then re-suspended with 1 ml of 0.05% Block Ace (Snow Brand Milk Products Co., Ltd, Hokkaido, Japan) in Tween-20 PBS. Two microlitres of serum at dilutions of 100-10,000 times was incubated with 25 ml of the peptide-coupled colour-coded beads for 2 h at room temperature on a plate shaker in a 96-well filter plate (MultiScreen TM -BV, Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). After incubation, the plate was washed by using a vacuum manifold apparatus and was incubated with 100 ml of biotinylated goat anti-human IgG (gamma-chain-specific: Vector Laboratory Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature on a plate shaker. The plate was then washed, and 100 ml of streptavidin-PE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added into wells, followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature on a plate shaker. The bound beads were washed three times followed by the addition of 100 ml of Tween-20 PBS into each well, and the plate was placed for 3 min on a plate shaker. Fifty microlitres of sample was analysed by using the Luminex TM system with the help of the method reported previously (13, 9, 15) . (Table 1 ). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the reactivity against any of 42 peptides between the HD and the contact persons.",

In contrast to these four peptides, significant levels of IgG reactive to the remaining 36 peptides were either scarcely or not detected in the patients (Table 1) Fig. 5 . Absorption test. The immunoglobulin-G (IgG) activity to each of the S791, M207 and N161 peptides was absorbed by using a triplicate assay with an immobilized corresponding peptide and each of the five different irrelevant peptides. The method for the preparation of immobilized peptides was the same as the method used for ELISA plate preparation, as described in the legend of Fig. 4 . The results of the absorption test were analysed by means of a two-tailed Student's t-test. All tests of significance were two-sided. In order to test the specificity of anti-peptide IgG in the serum samples, 100 ml/well of serum samples (1 : 100 dilution with 0.05% PBST) was absorbed with the immobilized peptide (200 mg/well: closed bar or 40 mg/well: open bar, as final concentrations) in wells kept for 2 h at room temperature. The absorption was repeated three times, and then the level of peptide-specific IgG in the resultant supernatant was measured. PBST, Tween-20 PBS.",

The patients' sera showed significantly higher levels of anti-peptide activities (P < 0.05) against 42 of 197 peptides tested, including 20 spike (S), seven membrane (M) and 15 nucleocapsid (N)-derived peptides (Fig. 1). The scores, for instance, for the fluorescence intensity (FI) of the anti-SARS-CoV spike protein at positions 791-805 (termed anti-S791) were highest among the peptides tested, and were 1813, 22,964 and 11,240 in the sera of the three patients, whereas those of the controls were 207, 58 and 210, respectively. The scores for the FI of the anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein at positions 161-175 (termed anti-N161) were 697, 815 and 14,084, whereas those of the controls were 0, 11 and 129, respectively.

One of them, the N66 (nucleocapsid protein at positions 161-182) peptide, was 7-amino acids longer at the C-terminal than the N161 (at positions 161-175)peptide reported in this study. These findings suggest that this region of nucleocapsid proteins is one of the most highly immunogenic epitopes of the SARS-CoV when peptides are used. However, the S791 peptide shown to be the other candidate of immunogenic peptides in the present study was not tested byWang et al. (4), because they selected peptides with relatively high hydrophilicity. They also did not detect the M207 peptide as an immunogenic epitope, although they tested the M206 peptide, which is one N-terminal amino acid longer than the M207 peptide.In order to determine the cross-reactivity of the patients' sera to the other infectious diseases or auto-immune diseases, sera from Japanese patients with hepatitis-C virus (n \u00bc 12), influenza virus (n \u00bc 12), rheumatoid arthritis (n \u00bc 15) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n \u00bc 10) and the Japanese HD (n \u00bc 27) were also tested at the same times at a serum dilution of 1 : 100. However, anti-S791, anti-M207 or anti-N161 activity was not detectable in the Anti-peptide immunoglobulin-G (IgG) at post-infection. The 42 peptides shown inFig. 1were tested for their reactivity to sera from post-infection (6th month) patients with the Vietnamese SARS-CoV infection (n \u00bc 45). As negative controls, the sera of both Vietnamese healthy donors (V-HD) (n \u00bc 50) and the contact persons (CP), who were free from illness of SARS-CoV infection but worked in the same hospitals, were tested. Sera from Japanese patients withhepatitis-C virus (HCV), influenza (Flu), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), along with Japanese HD (J-HD), were also tested at the same times at a serum dilution of 1 : 100. Representative results of the fluorescence intensity (FI) scores at a serum dilution of 100 : 1 of anti-S791, anti-M207 and anti-N161 activities have been shown in this figure. The significance of the differences (*P < 0.05) in Luminex reactivities of SARS patients against all of other negative control groups, including V-HD, CP, J-HD, Flu, HCV, RA and SLE, was observed by means of Mann-Whitney test. Plasma from 78 Vietnamese post-infection (6th month, n \u00bc 45) SARS-CoV patients was collected at Hanoi French Hospital and Bach Mai Hospital in Vietnam. All cases met a modified World Health Organization (WHO) case definition of SARS (16). This study was approved by both the Japanese and Vietnamese Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from each of the participants. Sera from Japanese patients with Flu (n \u00bc 12), HCV (n \u00bc 12), RA (n \u00bc 15) and SLE (n \u00bc 10) and Japanese healthy donors (J-HD, n \u00bc 27) were provided by Kurume University Hospital and Kurume Medical Center after informed consent was obtained.

These results indicate that anti-S791, anti-M207 and anti-N161 activities were largely restricted to the SARS-CoV infection, although sera of Vietnamese patients shall be provided as controls to confirm this issue.Both the Luminex TM and ELISA were employed for the measurement of anti-peptide antibodies in order to ensure the reliability of the former new method. As expected, both the assays could detect anti-SARS peptide activity reactive to each of the three peptides with relatively higher sensitivity in the Luminex assay for the measurement of anti-M207 antibody.

However, there was no information on sera obtained 6 months after the onset of the disease, at least in the literatures we read. Viral RNA may persist for some time in patients, who have humoral responses to it, whereas some patients may lack an antibody response to the SARS-CoV after the onset of illness (12, 13). Prolonged shedding of viral RNA in respiratory secretions (11 days after the onset of illness), plasma (up to 9 days) and stool specimens (25 days) has been documented (13). Serum antibody levels do not correlate with protection, although local antibody is believed to play an important role in protection (14). Rather, the upsurge of the IgG antibody to the SARS-CoV and its correlation with the progression of SARS were observed (13). Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the timing and intensity of humoral responses and their association with clinical manifestations of the disease is needed to better understand Fig. 5. the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV and to develop appropriate treatment modalities. In order to achieve the necessary level of understanding, we will perform kinetic studies for humoral responses to the three peptides reported in this study in the near future. Gao et al. (6) reported that an adenovirus-based vaccine could induce strong SARS-CoV-specific immune responses in the monkey, and this research holds promise for the development of a protective vaccine against the SARS causal agent. However, in order to develop this type of protective vaccine, many hurdles in terms of the safety, efficacy, cost benefits and durability must be overcome by performing basic and clinical studies. One of the key basic studies for vaccine development could be to identify immunogenic regions capable of inducing long-lasting immunity, and thus the results shown in this study may provide new information that will help us determine suitable vaccine candidates.",
