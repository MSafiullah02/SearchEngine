Research by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention assessed the lower respiratory tracts of these patients and discovered a novel coronavirus, which has since been named the 2019 novel coronavirus. 1 On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named this novel coronavirus pneumonia as coronavirus disease 2019 , whereas the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has named it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Huang et al 2 reported that the first 41 patients with COVID-19 exhibited fever, cough, myalgia, and/or fatigue as common symptoms, 29% of whom had ARDS and six of whom died (15%). The typical findings from chest CT scans were bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation. At earlier times during the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report exposure to food from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. With the epidemic gradually growing, it is now clear that human-to-human transmission has been prevalent. 3 As of March 10, 2020, there have been a total of 113,702 confirmed cases and 4,012 related deaths, among which 80,924 cases have occurred in China. 4 Importantly, when assessing COVID-19, it is noteworthy that influenza viruses share common etiologies and occur in the same season. Recently, global influenza associated with respiratory mortality is occurring at a higher frequency than what has been previously reported. 5 From September 2019 through present-day, there have been > 170,000 patients with influenza in the United States, more than one-half of whom have been infected with the influenza A (H1N1) virus. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia induced by influenza is 6.8%. 6 During the H1N1 global epidemic in 2009, Jain et al 7 found that 5% of patients with H1N1 influenza were admitted to ICUs and 7% died. Another study from Canada showed that the overall mortality among patients critically ill with H1N1 at 28 days was 14.3%. 8 The common symptoms of H1N1 infection include fever and productive cough, whereas GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are less common. Furthermore, ground-glass opacities are not commonly found on chest CT scans from patients with H1N1. 9 Although these two respiroviruses Q8 have loomed as epidemics in different regions at present, such epidemics can easily propagate to further regions over time due to climate change and global travel by individuals. Because of their distinct treatments and prognoses, it is important for clinicians and epidemiologists to accurately identify these two respiroviral infections via their differential clinical manifestations. The aim of the current study therefore was to compare the different clinical presentations between ARDS patients infected with COVID-19 vs those infected with H1N1 to provide some guidance for their differential diagnoses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 332, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1161, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1311, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1585, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1860, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2119, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2367, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2404, "text": "Q8", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Study Question:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Take Home Point"}, {"text": "The aim of the study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and H1N1 pneumonia in patients with ARDS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Take Home Point"}, {"text": "There were many differences between COVID-19induced ARDS patients and H1N1-induced ARDS patients in clinical presentations and outcome.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Compared with H1N1, patients with COVID-19induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA score adjusted mortality.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interpretation:"}, {"text": "This analysis was a retrospective case-control study.
