Plaque assays of aliquots from the gradient fractions revealed that approximately 75% of the virus was recovered in five of the 3H-peak fractions. Since distribu tion of infectivity coincided with the uridine label, this indicates that 3H-uridine was incorporated into the RNA of the virion.

Analysis of the resulting fractions revealed no difference in the distribution of 3H-activity of either the untreated or the NP-40-trcated virus, and in both cases, only a single major peak was revealed which had sedimented through three-fifths of the gradients. Because we were confident that virus had been disrupted, judging by EM monitoring it was concluded that rate-zonal centrifugation under these con- ditions was not appropriate to resolve these components and that not only was a steeper gradient required, but centrifugation should be carried out to equilibrium.

Distribution of 3H-!abel and infectivity in sucrose gradient after rate-zonal centrifugation of HCV/229E. at a density of 1.27. The former density (1.19) corresponds to equilibrium densities reported for intact coronaviruses [8] , while the latter (1.27) falls within the range of values reported for nucleoproteins isolated from a human coronavirus [8] as well as for several of the large RNA viruses [6] . Calcula tions revealed that 75% of the 3H-uridine label was regularly recovered in this peak. % sue ROSE W/W Fig.4 .
