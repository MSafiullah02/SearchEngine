Empiric therapy or prophylaxis should be strongly considered in transplant recipients with latent infection with tuberculosis (TB), Strongyloides stercoralis, coccidiomycosis, and for patients known to have received organs from donors with acute bacterial and fungal infections.

Some of these infections are latent, while others are the result of bad timing, with active infection transmitted at the time of transplantation. Numerous such infections have been recognized in transplant recipients, ranging from common and expected pathogens to unexpected pathogens such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus,1 Chagas disease,2 rabies,3 and TB. Three types of infection merit special attention. First, in donors who are bacteremic or have fungemia at the time of donation, such infections (staphylococci, pneumococcus, Candida species, Salmonella, Escherichia coli) may tend to \u201cstick\u201d to anastomotic sites (vascular, urinary) and may produce leaks, mycotic aneurysms, or surgical site infections. Second, viral infections, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are associated with particular syndromes and morbidity in the immunocompromised population (discussed later in text); the greatest risk of such infections is in recipients who are seronegative (immunologically na\u00efve) and receive infected grafts from seropositive donors (with latent or active viral infection). Third, latent infections, including TB, may activate many years after the initial exposure. Disseminated mycobacterial infection is often difficult to treat once established largely because of the significant immunosuppression and interactions between the antimicrobial agents used to treat infection (e.g., rifampin, streptomycin, isoniazid) and the agents used in immune suppressive therapy.",

Recent and remote exposures to endemic, geographically restricted systemic mycoses (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, and Histoplasma capsulatum) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can result in localized pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or disseminated infections. Asymptomatic S. stercoralis infections may reactivate decades after initial exposure in the setting of immunosuppressive therapy. Such reactivation can result in either a gastrointestinal illness with parasite migration and hyperinfestation syndrome (characterized by hemorrhagic enterocolitis, hemorrhagic pneumonia, or both) or disseminated infection with accompanying (usually) gram-negative bacteremia or meningitis. Gastroenteritis due to Salmonella species, Campylobacter jejuni, and a variety of enteric viruses can result in more severe and prolonged diarrheal disease with persistent infection and an increased risk of translocation into the bloodstream and metastatic infection.",

Nosocomial spread of Pneumocystis jiroveci between immunocompromised patients has also been suggested by a variety of case series.

These include surgical wound infections, pneumonia (aspiration), bacteremia due to vascular access or surgical drainage catheters, urinary tract infections, or infections of fluid collections (due to leaks of vascular or urinary anastomoses or lymphoceles). These are nosocomial infections and, as such, are due to the same bacteria and Candida infections observed in nonimmunosuppressed patients undergoing comparable surgery but with the immune suppression, the signs of infection may be subtle and the severity or duration may be greater. The technical skill of the surgeons and meticulous postoperative care (i.e., wound care, endotracheal tubes, vascular access devices, and drainage catheters) are the determinants of risk for these infections. Also among the common infections is C. difficile colitis. Limited perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for renal transplantation (i.e., from a single dose to 24 hours of an antibiotic such as cefazolin) is usually adequate with additional coverage only for known risk factors (e.g., prior colonization with MRSA). For pancreas transplantation, perioperative prophylaxis against yeasts with fluconazole is commonly used, remembering the interactions between azole antifungal agents and calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus (levels may be increased significantly).",

Ongoing infection must be eradicated prior to transplantation. Two forms of infection pose a special risk:1.Active bacterial infections: Bloodstream infections may be related to vascular access, including that for dialysis and pneumonia, which puts the patient at high risk for subsequent lung infection with nosocomial organisms. Infected ascites or peritoneal dialysis fluid must also be cleared prior to surgery. Urinary tract infection (UTI) must be eliminated prior to transplantation with antibiotics with or without nephrectomy. Similarly, skin disease that threatens the integrity of this primary defense against infection should be corrected before transplantation, even if doing so requires the initiation of immunosuppression prior to transplantation (e.g., the initiation of immune suppression to treat psoriasis or eczema). Finally, the history of more than one episode of diverticulitis should initiate an evaluation to determine whether sigmoid colectomy should be carried out prior to transplantation.2.Tuberculosis: The incidence of reactivation disease due to M. tuberculosis is far higher in the transplant recipient than in the general population. Patients with end-stage renal disease are more likely to be anergic and have a false-negative PPD. In a cohort of 118 subjects on hemodialysis, 41 (35%) were PPD-positive and 77 (65%) were negative, of which 62 (81%) were anergic.17 The newly developed interferon-gamma-based QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (Cellestis, Chadstone, Victoria, Australia) may be helpful in diagnosing some additional cases of latent tuberculosis in this setting, and may help distinguish those who have true latent TB from those who are PPD positive due to prior vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Recent work suggests that for optimal diagnostic accuracy, this test should be done before, rather than after, hemodialysis.18 Active tuberculosis must be treated prior to transplantation. Latent tuberculosis should be treated either before or at the time of transplantation. The major antituberculous drugs are potentially hepatotoxic, and significant drug interactions are common between the antituberculosis agents and the agents of immune suppression (especially the rifamycins).\n",

CMV cultures are generally too slow and insensitive for clinical use. A positive CMV culture (or shell vial culture) derived from respiratory secretions or urine is of little diagnostic value, since many patients secrete or shed CMV in the absence of invasive disease. Serological tests are useful prior to transplantation to predict risk but are of little value after transplantation in defining clinical disease (this statement includes measurements of anti-CMV IgM levels). Seroconversion in transplantation is generally delayed and thus not useful for clinical diagnosis. Seroconversion to CMV is evidence that that the patient has been exposed to CMV and has developed some degree of immunity. Serologies may be confounded by recent administration of blood products. The demonstration of CMV inclusions in tissues in the setting of a compatible clinical syndrome is the gold standard for diagnosis.",

Two strategies commonly used for CMV prevention are the following: 1) universal antiviral prophylaxis; and 2) preemptive therapy. Universal prophylaxis involves giving antiviral therapy to all at-risk patients beginning at or immediately posttransplantation for a defined time period. In preemptive therapy, quantitative assays are used to monitor patients at predefined intervals (often every week) to detect early disease. Positive assays result in therapy. Preemptive therapy incurs extra costs for monitoring and coordination of outpatient care while reducing the cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities. Universal prophylaxis has the possible advantage of preventing not only CMV infection during the period of greatest risk, but also diminishing infections due to HHV6, HHV7, and EBV. Further, the indirect effects of CMV (i.e., graft rejection, opportunistic infection) may also be reduced by routine prophylaxis. In practice, neither strategy is perfect.

BK nephropathy is rarely recognized in recipients of nonrenal organs.45 The clinical presentation of disease is usually as sterile pyuria, reflecting shedding of infected tubular and ureteric epithelial cells. These cells contain sheets of viruses and are detected by urine cytology as decoy cells.44 Some patients present with diminished renal allograft function or, rarely, with ureteric stenosis and obstruction. In such patients, the etiologies of decreased renal function must be carefully evaluated (e.g., mechanical obstruction, drug toxicity, pyelonephritis, rejection, thrombosis, active infection, or recurrent disease). The choice of treatment is to either increase immune suppression to treat suspected graft rejection or reduce immune suppression to allow the immune system to control infection. Patients with BK nephropathy treated with increased immune suppression have a high incidence of graft loss associated with further reactivation of the BK virus. Reduced immune suppression may stabilize viral activation, but risks graft rejection.

Stage 2 presents with cytopathic changes and, in addition, various degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. Stage 2 is subdivided into A, B, or C depending on the degree of inflammation/fibrosis: A less than 25%, B 25% to 50%, and C greater than 50%.

Mucocutaneous candidal infection (e.g., oral thrush, esophageal infection, cutaneous infection at intertriginous sites, vaginitis) occurs particularly when candidal overgrowth is promoted by the presence of high levels of glucose and glycogen in tissues and fluids (e.g., with poorly controlled diabetes, high-dose steroid therapy) and by broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. These infections are usually treatable through correction of the underlying metabolic abnormality and topical therapy with clotrimazole or nystatin. More difficult to manage is candidal infection occurring in association with the presence of foreign bodies that violate the mucocutaneous surfaces of the body (e.g., vascular access catheters, surgical drains, and bladder catheters). Optimal management of these infections requires removal of the foreign body and systemic antifungal therapy with fluconazole, an echinocandin, or an amphotericin product.",

Fluconazole (400-800 mg/day, with adjustment for renal dysfunction), because of its better safety profile, is usually used as initial therapy, unless the patient is critically ill or has a fluconazole-resistant species (e.g., Candida glabrata or Candida krusei). In these instances, therapy is with an echinocandin or amphotericin B, usually in a lipid preparation.

Early in the course of transplantation, central nervous system involvement with fungal infection is most often due to Aspergillus species, as was exemplified in a recent case report;87 later after transplantation, other fungi (Zygomycetes, dematiaceous fungi) are increasingly prominent, with a high mortality rate.88 The drug of choice for Aspergillus infection is probably voriconazole, noting the intense interactions between this agent and the calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus.

The cyst wall can be displayed by a variety of staining techniques; of these, the Gomori methenamine-silver nitrate method (which stains organisms brown or black) is most reliable, even though it is susceptible to artifacts.
