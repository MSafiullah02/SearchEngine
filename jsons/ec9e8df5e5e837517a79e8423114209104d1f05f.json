Almost all living species represent prey for a viral invader. Viruses have coevolved with their hosts and therefore have limited pathogenicity in an immunocompetent natural host. In turn, probably as a result of the constant evolutionary pressure from viral invaders, higher vertebrates have developed a complex immune system. Only in the last decade have we caught a glimpse of what viruses do beyond invading cells for replication. For millions of years viruses have studied cell biology and immunology the hard way, to acquire and defend an ecological niche.

The proteins encoded by RNA viruses are therefore multifunctional.

Nevertheless, the general outcome of these functions is the same: downregulation of MHC class I molecules or of some MHC class I alleles. The study of MHC class I regulation has revealed additional genes in herpesviruses of different species [36] [37] [38] , which might affect many cell types or only those tissues relevant for virus maintenance. Although the downregulation of MHC class I expression prevents CD8 \u03e9 T-cell recognition, cells that downregulate these molecules are targets for NK cells 1, 11, [32] [33] [34] . NK cells, the first line of cellular defense against viruses, have receptors for certain MHC molecules. Some of these receptors silence the cytolytic machinery of NK cells and act as killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR). Other receptors, designated leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LIR), are expressed mainly on monocytes and B cells. Engagement of an NK receptor can also result in NK activation as not all receptors carry an intracellular silencing domain. The HCMV protein UL18 and the MCMV m144 protein, which are homologous to MHC class I, could be associated with NK killing, and UL18 was instrumental in the identification of LIR-1. In addition, the HCMV UL40 protein provides a peptide selectively required for the maturation of the HLA-E molecule, an NK target 39, 40 . However, clinical isolates of HCMV confer a much stronger NK resistance than the laboratory strains sequenced and tested so far, and this resistance is unrelated to MHC class I expression and LIR-1 (Ref. 41) .
