Figure 1 illustrates a timeline of the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus within the hospital from the first confirmed case on March 20 to the most recent case on April 1. The first SARS-Cov-2\u2013positive case was a medical worker (P87), who was in close contact with a SARS-Cov-2\u2013infected nurse (P86).2 With the exception of the 2 infected cases, P86 and P28, who contracted the coronavirus from the outside, no HCW, non\u2013COVID-19 inpatients, or visitors had tested positive for the coronavirus. Since March 28, SARS-CoV-2 infections among nonclinical staff have emerged, and subsequently, 25 of the 37 COVID-19 cases (68%) were nonclinical staff working in the dining hall of the hospital. These catering workers were responsible for preparing meals and delivering food and hot water to patients and visitors across the hospital daily, and it is likely that these nonclinical staff are the main contributors to the spread of the virus within the hospital. Healthcare-associated infection is known characteristic of coronavirus-related diseases and a leading route of transmission.3\n",

Current patients are discharged only allowed if they test negative.2.Quick COVID-19 tests have been conducted for those having close contacts with the nonclinical staff and residents living nearby the hospital.3.Immediate lockdown has been imposed on the hospital units involved in the COVID-19 spread, and as of March 28, on the entire facility. Disinfection was conducted at the hospital in the evening of the same day.\n",

Therefore, in addition to the measures above, the hospital should take into consideration the following suggestions to stave off widespread coronavirus transmission in this healthcare facility and in the community:1.Makeshift healthcare facilities are needed to accommodate non\u2013COVID-19 outpatients and visitors as well as HCWs.2.Because evidence increasingly favors the use of face masks, nonclinical staff should strictly wear new face masks and gloves and should update their daily health status using COVID-19 monitoring apps, such as NCOVI software developed for Vietnamese citizens.3.Transparency in healthcare leaders\u2019 response to the COVID-19 infections should be prioritized for the COVID-19 illness.4.A targeted educational strategy to improve COVID-19 health literacy and knowledge for nonclinical staff in hospitals should be urgently considered.\n",
