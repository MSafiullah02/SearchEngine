Infection prevalence rates have been reported to range from 2\u00b73% to 74.3%, with the higher rates being found in sheltered animals (Papini et al. 2005, Guest et al. 2007, Batchelor et al. 2008, Tzannes et al. 2008, Gates & Nolan 2009, Epe et al. 2010, Olson et al. 2010, Upjohn et al. 2010).",

There is a need to evaluate the diagnostic performance of new coproantigenic detection tests as there are studies showing that assays that can be used for the detection of Giardia spp in human samples do not detect the presence of cysts in animal samples (Mekaru et al. 2007, Gow et al. 2009) and studies that demonstrate the lack of reactivity when the same tests are used in different animal species (Wilson & Hankenson 2010).",
