It is common within large dog populations, such as those in re-homing or training kennels. Vaccines are vital in its management of CIRD, but they often fail to prevent disease. Recently, a number of novel pathogens have been identified in CIRD outbreaks and represent new targets for vaccination. Key findings Innate immune responses provide a vital first line of defence against the infectious agents involved in the development of CIRD. Once breeched, adaptive mucosal immunity is necessary to prevent infection and limit spread. Current vaccines target only a few of the agents involved in CIRD. Evidence, from the limited amount of published data, indicates that although vaccinating against these agents reduces infection rates, duration of shedding and severity of disease, it does not induce sterilising immunity; and this has important consequences for the management of the disease, and the future of CIRD vaccine development. Summary In the process of considering the development of novel CIRD vaccines, this paper focuses on the immunological mechanisms that provide protection for the respiratory tract, the current recommendations for canine vaccination, and the challenges surrounding existing CIRD vaccines, and their future development. bs_bs_banner And Pharmacology Journal of Pharmacy Review", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), also known as 'kennel cough' , is a common disease syndrome that is particularly prevalent within large dog populations, such as those in re-homing or training kennels. CIRD represents a major welfare issue for kennel facilities, pet owners and veterinarians globally, with outbreaks resulting in delays to re-homing and training and expensive treatment costs. It is characterised by clinical signs such as coughing, nasal discharge and dyspnoea, which can persist for several weeks and may result in severe disease, such as bronchopneumonia, and even, on occasions, lead to death or euthanasia. [1] Akin to respiratory syndromes in cattle (bovine respiratory disease complex) [2] and pigs (porcine respiratory disease complex), [3] CIRD is a complex infection of multifactorial aetiology, where multiple pathogens act sequentially or synergistically to cause disease. In addition, environmental factors, age, stress and underlying health problems can also contribute to disease spread and susceptibility. Kennelled dogs are particularly at risk of CIRD because of the high population density, and, in re-homing shelters, there is often a constant influx of susceptible animals and pathogens compounding the situation. [4] The pathogens traditionally associated with CIRD, include canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV or PIV5), [5] canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), [6] canine herpes virus 1 (CHV-1) [7] and Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb). [8, 9] They are spread through aerosolised droplets from coughing and sneezing, and by contact with fomites present on items such as bedding, bowls and clothing. Methods for preventing CIRD include both (1) good biosecurity such as quarantine of new and sick animals, and high levels of sanitation and (2) efficacious vaccination. [10] Often however, shelters do not have the space for implementing quarantine procedures, and in busy kennel environments, maintaining high levels of sanitation is challenging. Thus, vaccination is vital in managing this disease, and as such, several monoand multivalent vaccines are available (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 642, "end": 645, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 775, "end": 778, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1268, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1373, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1411, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1445, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1485, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1488, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1817, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2108, "end": 2117, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction: canine infectious respiratory disease"}, {"text": "There is, however widespread, if anecdotal, recognition that current vaccines often fail to prevent CIRD, and this has sparked a resurgence of interest in the prevention of this disease.

The epithelial barrier is composed of pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells joined by tight junctions, which regulate the movement of particulate matter across the barrier. Mucociliary clearance occurs as a result of the constant shedding of 'sticky' mucus (in which pathogens become trapped) and the continual movement of this mucus by the ciliated epithelial cells away from the lower respiratory tract and into the pharynx.

Mucosal epithelial cells detect pathogens using pattern recognition receptors and signal to epithelial DCs via cytokines and chemokines. DCs beneath the epithelium extend dendrites between epithelial cells to sample the lumen. In the FAE of the MALT, M-cells transport antigen to DCs residing in M-cell pockets, which present antigens to intraepithelial T and B lymphocytes. Activated DCs migrate to lymphoid follicles or nodes to initiate adaptive immune responses. Plasma cells migrate from the lymphoid follicles and produce IgA, which is transported across the epithelium into the lumen. compliment cascade that inhibit or kill invading pathogens. The elements are produced by epithelial cells and other cellular components of the innate immune system, and they modify the composition of the airway mucus. (3) A range of cellular components are essential for effective antiviral or bacterial responses and includes not only the epithelial cells, but also the phagocytic immune cells (e.g. macrophage, dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils), which engulf and digest microorganisms using a range of lytic enzymes, proteases and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 59, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Follicle associated epithelium"}, {"text": "Macrophage and DCs also act as antigen presenting cells in stimulating adaptive immune responses. Innate immune responses require no prior exposure and thus are particularly important when a dog encounters a new pathogen for the first time. However many respiratory pathogens have evolved strategies for overcoming these primary defences and cause widespread damage to the epithelium, resulting in loss of epithelial barrier integrity. This may be characterised by morphological changes to the cell (as a result of cytotoxic effects of viral replication, toxins, induction of apoptosis) including the loss of cilia or cilia function, disruption to tight junctions, increased mucus production and the down regulation of the proinflammatory cytokines responsible for the recruitment and activation of phagocytic immune cells. Pathogens that can compromise these innate mechanisms are likely to facilitate deeper penetration of the airways by both itself and other 'bystander' microorganisms, and thus, appropriate adaptive immune responses are also required. [31] [32] [33] In contrast to innate responses, adaptive immune responses are antigen specific and result in an immunological memory that helps to prevent recurrent infections by the same pathogen. Importantly, it is also able to differentiate between antigens that enter the body through mucosal surfaces (such as those involved in CIRD) and those that enter via injection or injury, and tailors its response accordingly. During infection, CIRD pathogens trigger both mucosal and systemic immune responses. In terms of disease prevention, it is thus safe to assume that preventative immunity for respiratory pathogens is highly dependent upon both mucosal and systemic immunity, and both should be carefully considered during CIRD vaccine development. It is however predominantly the mucosal immune response that provides protection against pathogen adherence, colonisation and invasion at the mucosal surface, whereas the systemic response is more largely involved in containing and clearing infection once an infection takes hold, suggesting that vaccines that preferentially stimulate mucosal immunity may be of greater benefit.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1057, "end": 1061, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1071, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Follicle associated epithelium"}, {"text": "Immunity at the mucosal surface is mediated by the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), where strategi-cally placed lymphoid follicles serve as the principle immune induction sites.

The main function of MALT is (1) to protect mucus membranes against pathogenic microbes, (2) to distinguish and tolerate innocuous antigens (e.g. ingested food, airborne matter and commensal organisms) and (3) to prevent the development of harmful immune responses to antigens that cross the mucosa and enter the body. [35] The MALT is subdivided according to the mucosal tissue with which it is associated (i.e. gastro-intestinal, respiratory, cervical), and its composition differs between species. In dogs, the palatine, lingual and nasopharyngeal tonsils are the most clearly identified components of the respiratory MALT. [34, 36] There are a number of ways in which mucosal immune responses may be initiated, but all entail pathogen sensing, and the engagement of specialised mucosal DCs, which help govern the nature of the ensuing mucosal immune response (details of which can be found in the following reviews [37] [38] [39] [40] and outlined in Figure 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 191, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 952, "end": 956, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1248, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1253, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1258, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1263, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1280, "end": 1288, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues"}, {"text": "Briefly, DC activation may occur as follows: (1) Mucosal epithelial cells may detect pathogens using pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors and RNA-sensing molecules.

They elicit strong cellular and antibody responses, with a long duration of immunity and, for this reason, they are often superior to inactivated or subunit vaccines, especially in young dogs, where maternally derived antibody (MDA) may be present. [42] Live attenuated vaccines for many viruses are relatively easy to create as they only have a small number of genes that can be easily manipulated. Attenuated vaccines are most often generated through the continuous culture of the virus in established laboratory cell lines (for typically 50-100 passages depending on the virus). As the virus grows and adapts to its new environment, it mutates into a strain that can then replicate only poorly its natural host. Because live attenuated vaccines replicate within the host, they do not require adjuvants, and in some situations, shedding of the vaccine strain by recently vaccinated animals, may be useful for generating herd immunity where vaccination of all individuals is challenging, but has the risk of inducing vaccine-derived disease in immunocompromised contacts. [43] The major disadvantage with live attenuated vaccines is the possibility that they may revert to a virulent form and cause disease, and may be unsafe for use in either immunocompromised or pregnant animals.

[42] It is generally considered that although subcutaneous vaccines are good at inducing systemic immunity, they tend to be relatively poor inducers of mucosal immunity; conversely, mucosal vaccines have been shown to be good at inducing both mucosal and systemic immune responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 988, "end": 992, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 993, "end": 996, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1000, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1118, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 258, "end": 267, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 551, "end": 560, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Non-core canine infectious respiratory disease vaccinations"}, {"text": "Although published studies for canine vaccines are extremely limited, in one study comparing intranasal and subcutaneous Bb vaccinations, dogs receiving intranasal vaccinations had higher sIgA levels (in nasal secretions) and were significantly better protected from challenge with a virulent Bb strain at 9 weeks postvaccination, when compared with dogs receiving a subcutaneous Bb or placebo vaccines. [47] In an experimental study where dogs were vaccinated with different doses of an intranasal Bb vaccine, shedding of the vaccine strain was detected up to 4 weeks postvaccination. Following challenge with virulent Bb, clinical signs of disease and shedding of the challenge strain were reduced in a vaccine dose-dependent manner. [56] In another study, comparing CPIV intranasal and parenteral vaccines, dogs vaccinated via the intranasal route had significantly reduced clinical signs of disease following challenge. Furthermore, viral shedding was reduced from 70% in control dogs, to 50% in dogs vaccinated via the parenteral route, and to 1% in dogs vaccinated intranasally. [48] In kennel situations, where speed of immunity is paramount, mucosal vaccines are also preferred. [42] Unfortunately, no detailed studies relating to onset of immunity following subcutaneous Bb vaccination have been published; however, in one study examining intranasal Bb vaccination, a steady increase in agglutinating antibody titres were observed 1-4 weeks postvaccination, with no significant difference observed in dogs receiving different vaccination doses. [56] In another study, the vaccine was shown to induce protective immunity 72 h postvaccination. [57] Although the reason for the rapid onset of immunity was not determined within the scope of that study, studies within the field of TB vaccination have shown that mucosal vaccines are able to provide non-specific immunity immediately after vaccination by stimulating innate immune responses at the mucosal surface (reviewed in Beverly et al [58] ), and it is possible that similar mechanisms were at play.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 404, "end": 408, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 736, "end": 740, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1089, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1191, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1558, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1655, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2000, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Non-core canine infectious respiratory disease vaccinations"}, {"text": "To date, published data relating to CPIV vaccine efficacy remain extremely limited; [59] its assessment is hampered by difficulties in reproducing disease in laboratory models (often mild or negligible) and by uncontrollable influences in field studies, such as the presence of other diseasecausing agents.

[14] In busy kennel environments with a high turnover of dogs and the presence of other risk factors, underlying CPIV and Bb infections, may contribute to the development of more severe diseases. [65] An additional issue arising from the efficacy and safety perspectives is the vaccination of immunocompromised individuals. Particularly in the re-homing or rescue kennel environment, dogs may be immunocompromised as a result of stress, malnutrition, disease or other underlying conditions. Trying to induce a rapid protective immune response in such animals poses additional challenges and leaves the animal susceptible to infection in the intervening period between booster vaccinations, increasing the demand for quarantine measures. From a safety perspective, the use of live attenuated vaccines in immunocompromised individuals may result in vaccineassociated disease.

Indeed similar findings have been shown for human parainfluenza virus (PIV) infections, where multiple repeat infections occur and immunity correlates with higher (and likely more broadly cross-reactive) neutralising antibody titres. [66] [67] [68] Although experimental intranasal vaccine studies in dogs support the idea that local mucosal immunity in CPIV infections is important, there is no published data characterising the mucosal immune response to CPIV in the canine host, and there are very little data relating to the characterisation and duration of cell-mediated immune responses or CPIV serum antibodies following either natural or experimental infection, or vaccination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 572, "end": 576, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 577, "end": 581, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Canine parainfluenza virus infection and immunity"}, {"text": "There has also been very limited exploration of the genetic and antigenic diversity of circulating CPIV strains. PIV species possesses two major spike glycoproteins, one involved in cell attachment (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) and the other involved in mediating the fusion of viral host cell membranes (Fusion). It is against these two proteins that neutralising antibodies are targeted in convalescent serum. [69] [70] [71] Studies conducted in the 1960s using polyclonal serum revealed few antigenic differences; however, the study was limited to only three canine isolates. [72, 73] In a 1980s study, the use of monoclonal antibodies revealed minor differences in the HN and F proteins, although of the five PIV5 isolates used, only two were derived from dogs. [74] To date, only six complete CPIV genome sequences have been published, and very little additional sequence data for individual viral genes are available, much of which is based on cell culture passaged isolates. [75] In 2014, a study comparing the six CPIV genomes and nine additional PIV5 genomes from different species (six human, one simian and two porcine), revealed a remarkably low-level diversity in the HN and F genes, regardless of host, year of isolation or geographic origin. [75] Interestingly, however, the highest degree of diversity was seen among the canine isolates, [75] and by analogy with human and bovine parainfluenza species, it is possible that the diversity among CPIV strains may be greater than current studies indicate. [76] Nevertheless, the authors suggested that the low level of variation observed was an indication that the virus is either not particularly immunogenic or that cell-mediated immunity is more important.

In our case, with CIRD, we have proposed that certain viruses, i.e. CRCoV and CnPnV, can allow mycoplasmas and bacteria to penetrate the deeper airways and cause clinical disease.

A way forward may be through a prime and boost schedule, which utilises both mucosal and parenteral vaccination strategies.
