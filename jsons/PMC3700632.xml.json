            "text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that contain a genomic RNA from 26\u201332 kb in length (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). Coronaviruses have been divided into four genera based on antigenic and sequence comparisons (Siddell, 1995). Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), one of the most extensively studied coronaviruses, is a 32 kb betacoronavirus (Britton, 2008). Cells infected with MHV contain genomic RNA and six to seven subgenomic mRNAs that make up a 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set (Leibowitz et al., 1981, van der Born, 2008). Analysis of deletion mutants of MHV defective interfering (DI) RNAs indicated that DI replication requires cis-acting elements located within the 3\u2032 terminal 436 nucleotides of the virus (Kim et al., 1993, Lin and Lai, 1993). This 436 nts region extends upstream of the 301 nts 3\u2032 UTR into the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. Subsequent studies demonstrated that in the context of the entire virus, the N protein gene can be moved to a different part of the genome with no effect on virus replication, implying that the 3\u2032 UTR contains all the 3\u2032 cis-acting sequences necessary for this process (de Haan et al., 2002, Goebel et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Multiple studies have been performed to determine the RNA secondary structures present in the 3\u2032UTR and their functional role in viral replication (Goebel et al., 2004, Goebel et al., 2007, Hsue et al., 2000, Hsue and Masters, 1997, Johnson et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2001, Liu et al., 1997, Williams et al., 1999, Yu and Leibowitz, 1995a, Yu and Leibowitz, 1995b, Zust et al., 2008). Initial studies of the MHV 3\u2032UTR RNA secondary structure predicted three stem-loop structures in the 3\u2032-most 171 nts of the genome [excluding the poly(A) tail] (Yu and Leibowitz, 1995b). Subsequently, the Hsue and Masters also examined the secondary structure of the 3\u2032UTR and predicted that the 5\u2032 68 nts of the 3\u2032 UTR folded into a bulged stem-loop required for viral replication (Hsue and Masters, 1997). Biochemical studies supported this bulged stem-loop structure and suggested that it was necessary for RNA replication, although the terminal loop and the first internal loop near the base of the stem were found to be larger than originally thought (Hsue et al., 2000, Hsue and Masters, 1997). Williams et al. (Williams et al., 1999) examined the 3\u2032UTR in bovine coronavirus and reported evidence for a phylogenetically conserved pseudoknot. This pseudoknot encompasses nts 238-185 (note that the 3\u2032-most nucleotide upstream of the poly(A) tail is position 1 in this numbering scheme, with numbers ascending in the 5\u2032 direction) in MHV, and its 5\u2032 stem overlaps with the last segment of the upstream bulged stem-loop (positions 301\u2013224 in MHV), making the two secondary structures in part mutually exclusive. This led to the hypothesis that these two structures may be alternate conformers of the same region of genomic RNA and constitute a molecular switch (Hsue et al., 2000). A genetic analysis using viral mutants isolated by targeted recombination supports this hypothesis (Goebel et al., 2004). A study examining the secondary structure of the last 166 nucleotides of the 3\u2032UTR, a region downstream of the pseudoknot predicted a long multi-branch stem loop in this region of the genome, a model that was largely supported by enzymatic probing of RNA secondary structure (Liu et al., 2001). DI RNA replication assays supported a functional role for several stems in this structure. Subsequent re-examination of this data favored a somewhat different conformation for the last 42 nucleotides in the 3\u2032UTR (Johnson et al., 2005). A series of DI RNA replication assays showed that mutations within this region (nts 42-1) that disrupted (ATW3\u2032 and ATW5\u2032) or restored (ATW) a predicted stem in this region prevented the accumulation of DI RNAs (Johnson et al., 2005). When these same mutations (ATW, ATW3\u2032, and ATW5\u2032) were introduced into the 3\u2032UTR of the complete viral genome, only the ATW mutation was lethal; viruses containing the ATW3\u2032 and ATW5\u2032 mutations grew almost as well as wild type virus in a one-step growth curve experiment although they did produce significantly smaller plaques than wild type (Johnson et al., 2005). Goebel et al. (Goebel et al., 2007) demonstrated that a hyper variable bulged stem loop spanning nts 46\u2013156 was not essential for MHV replication, even though this otherwise poorly conserved region contains a highly conserved octanucleotide sequence present in virtually all coronaviruses (Boursnell et al., 1985), and proposed a secondary structure model of the complete MHV 3\u2032UTR (Goebel et al., 2004, Goebel et al., 2007). Based in part on sequence co-variation, Zust et al. (Zust et al., 2008) subsequently revised the 3\u2032 region of this model (see\nFig. 1) to reflect potential conserved base pairings present in viruses representing all three coronavirus subgroups. Although the phylogenetic conservation of the proposed secondary structural model is persuasive and suggests that the proposed secondary structures are functionally important, a genetic test of the functional importance of this structure was not performed.",

Mutations opening up S3 were lethal, but large disruptions in S4 generated both viable and lethal mutants. Genomes carrying the original mutations in S3 or S4 plus compensatory mutations that restored base pairing in these stems were all viable and had robust growth phenotypes.

            "text": "In the Zust et al. model of the MHV 3\u2032UTR (Zust et al., 2008), nucleotides 0 to 9 (note that the 5\u2032-most A of the poly(A) tail is designated as position 0) are base paired with the L1 loop of the pseudoknot to form a helical stem (labeled S3 in Fig. 1A); nucleotides 18\u201329 are base-paired (S4 in Fig. 1A) with sequences downstream of the pseudoknot stem S2. In an earlier study of protein interacting sequences in the 3\u2032UTR (Johnson et al., 2005), three mutations that mapped to S3 and/or S4 (see Fig. 1) in the Zust et al. model of the MHV 3\u2032UTR (Zust et al., 2008) were examined for their effects on replication. These mutations, originally named ATW3\u2032, ATW5\u2032, and ATW (Johnson et al., 2005) have been renamed as A, B, and AB in the current study to increase clarity (see Fig. 1B and C). When these three mutations are introduced into the genomic RNA, genomes containing the A and B mutations lead to viable viruses, however, the genome containing the AB mutation is lethal (Johnson et al., 2005). Based on our earlier results with the A, B, and AB mutants we hypothesized that the presence of either of the two stems is sufficient for a viable virus, but disruption of both stems is lethal. To investigate this hypothesis and to perform a genetic test of the Zust secondary structure model of the 3\u2032UTR, we made a series of additional mutations targeting S3 and S4. Mutations C and D, were designed to destabilize S3 and S4 respectively; mutation CD destabilizes both S3 and S4 (Fig. 1B). Mutations that affected both sides of S3 and S4 were designated ABD, ABC, and ABCD (Fig. 1C). When mutations C, D, ABC, and ABD, which destabilize base-pairing in either the S3 (D, ABC) or S4 (C, ABD) helices were introduced into the genomic RNA, they all produced viable virus with somewhat smaller plaque sizes compared to the wild type virus (\nFig. 2A), grew with near identical kinetics to wild type virus, and achieved peak titers that were at least 25% of those achieved by wild type virus (Fig. 2B). However, for genomes carrying mutation CD, a mutation which disrupts base-pairing in both S3 and S4, we were unable to recover virus in multiple trials, thus we concluded that this mutation was lethal, similar to the results we obtained with the A, B, and AB mutations in our previous work (Johnson et al., 2005). Furthermore, when mutant ABCD, which restores base-pairing in stems S3 and S4 but alters the sequences of these stems, was introduced into the genomic RNA it was viable and generated a virus that forms plaques almost identical in size to those formed by wild type virus, grew with nearly identical kinetics to wild type virus, and achieved a peak titer nearly identical to that of wild type virus (Fig. 2A and B). These results are entirely consistent with the Zust model (Zust et al., 2008) of the 3\u2032UTR and our hypothesis that base-pairing in either S3 or S4 are necessary for MHV viability.",

To determine the RNA species that might have been generated in cells electroporated with genomes containing the CD mutation, we performed nested RT-PCR assays to detect negative-strand genomic RNA and negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 and mRNA6. These RNAs serve as templates for genomic and subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Pasternak et al., 2003, Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990, Sola et al., 2005, Zuniga et al., 2004). Nested RT-PCR results showed that negative-strand genomic RNAs were present in cells at 4 and 8 h after electroporation with in vitro transcribed genomes carrying the CD mutation, similar to what we observed after electroporation of WT genomes (Fig. 2C). In contrast, neither negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 nor RNA6 were detected in cells electroporated with in vitro transcribed genomes carrying the CD mutation, whereas cells electroporated with WT genomes contained negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 and RNA6 at 8 h incubation (Fig. 2D and E). For each sample, parallel RT-PCR reactions without an RT step were performed to ensure that residual DNA templates taken up by the cells during electroporation did not produce PCR signals (data not shown). These data show that genomes carrying the CD mutation destabilizing stems S3 and S4 are defective in directing subgenomic RNA synthesis, the identical phenotype detected with the AB mutations on the opposing sides of the stem in our previous work (Johnson et al., 2005).",

A series of mutants E, F, G, H, EH, and FG were made for this purpose (\nFig. 3). Mutations E and H, two mutants that completely disrupt S3, were lethal; a mutation in the 5\u2032 side of S4 that completely disrupted this stem, mutation G, produced the same lethal phenotype. However, the mutation in the 3\u2032 side of S4, mutation F, produced a viable virus. All plaque isolates of F mutant virus, from two independent electroporations, also contained a second site mutation, either A5/C5 or A6/C6. C5 or C6 can base-pair with G221 which is extruded in the WT S3 stem; this base-pairing increased the stability of S3 in viruses we recovered containing the F mutation. Sequencing of the nsp8 and nsp9 coding regions of these mutants failed to reveal additional second site mutations. Unsurprisingly, mutations that restored the S3 and S4 helices, mutations EH and FG, both generated viable mutants viruses EH and FG. These viable mutants have smaller plaque sizes, but essentially equivalent one-step growth curve compared to wild type virus (\nFig. 4A and C). RNA species present in cells electroporated with the lethal G and H mutants were analyzed by RT-PCR as described above for the AB and CD lethal mutants; negative sense genomic RNAs were detected when cells were electroporated with genomes containing the lethal mutants H in S3 and G in S4; however, subgenomic RNA synthesis is defective in these mutants (Fig. 4D and E). These results suggest that S3 is critical for virus viability, with complete disruption of S3 leading to a defect in subgenomic RNA synthesis and thus a lethal phenotype. The disparate effects of the F (viable), G (lethal), and FG (viable) mutations in S4 led us to model the possible effects of these three mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3\u2032UTR in Mfold. The Mfold models suggest that the G mutant has the potential to fold into a very different structure than the wild type structure but with a similar thermodynamic stability, perhaps accounting for the G mutant's lethal phenotype. In contrast the F mutation is predicted to simply result in local unfolding of S4. This suggests that S4 is not essential for virus viability.",

RNA secondary structural features are often important in the function of these cis-acting regions. In this study we have performed a functional analysis of the RNA secondary structural model of the MHV 3\u2032UTR originally proposed by Zust et al. (Zust et al., 2008) utilizing a reverse genetics approach. The conservation amongst group 2 coronaviruses of the structural elements of the 3\u2032UTR, namely the bulged stem-loop and overlapping pseudoknot and the conserved S3 and S4 helices connected by a variable length loop (see Fig. 1A) (Zust et al., 2008), and the ability of other group 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV and BCoV) 3\u2032UTRs with primary sequences that diverge significantly from MHV to functionally replace the MHV 3\u2032UTR (Goebel et al., 2004, Hsue and Masters, 1997, Kang et al., 2006), suggests the RNA secondary structure of the 3\u2032UTR plays a key functional role in coronavirus replication. The overlap of the most distal portion of the bulged stem-loop with the pseudoknot makes these two structures mutually exclusive. This led to the hypothesis that these two structures may be alternate conformations of the same region of genomic RNA and constitute a molecular switch (Hsue et al., 2000). Genetic studies demonstrated that both the pseudoknot and base-pairing of the lower region of the bulged-stem-loop were functionally important, supporting this hypothesis (Goebel et al., 2004). Biophysical studies (Stammler et al., 2011) demonstrate that the pseudoknotted conformation is much less stable than the double-hairpin conformation but suggest that stacking of the pseudoknot with the S3 helix can stabilize the pseudoknotted conformation allowing it to form. Mutations predicted to disrupt the S3 helix, (mutations E and H) were both lethal, whereas the double mutation EH predicted to restore the S3 helix, resulted in a viable virus, consistent with the idea that this stem may be necessary to allow the pseudoknotted conformation to form, or is necessary for viral replication in its own right.",

Mutation G, in the 5\u2032 side of S4 and predicted to completely disrupt the S4 helix produced a lethal phenotype. This contrasted with the mutation in the 3\u2032 side of the S4 helix, mutation F, which reproducibly produced a viable virus with a second site mutation in the S3 helix that stabilized this structure. The double mutant FG, predicted to restore the predicted structure, resulted in a viable virus, entirely consistent with the Zust (Zust et al., 2008) model. Modeling the possible effects of these three mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3\u2032UTR in Mfold, suggests that the G mutant has the potential to cause the region containing the triple helix junction (S2, S3, and S4, see Fig. 1) to fold into a completely different two helix structure with a similar thermodynamic stability as the wild type structure. This structure, lacking the S2 stem-loop and both the S3 and S4 helices, would not be able to form the pseudoknotted structure or the double stem-loop structure (extended bulged stem-loop plus S2-L2 stem-loop), likely accounting for the G mutant's lethal phenotype. In contrast the F mutation is predicted to simply result in local unfolding of S4. All of the viruses we recovered with the F mutation in S4 also contained second site A5C or A6C mutations in S3 that resulted in a G\u2013C base pair replacing an A\u2013U base pair, thus increasing in the stability of S3 by a small amount. Our failure to recover viruses that contain the F mutation without any second site mutations, raises the possibility that S4 interacts (stacks) with the S3 helix, making a further necessary contribution to the stability of the 3\u2032UTR, particularly in the pseudoknotted configuration.",

A quadruple mutation (ABCD) that maintained both S3 and S4 while altering the sequences of these stems yielded a virus with an in vitro phenotype virtually identical to that of wild type virus. These results strongly support the Zust (Zust et al., 2008) model. Modeling the possible effects of the lethal AB and CD mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3\u2032UTR in Mfold, suggests that the CD mutant has only one thermodynamically stable conformation in which the region containing the triple helix junction (S2, S3, and S4, see Fig. 1) folds into a completely different structure consisting of a long bulged stem-loop linked to a shorter bulged stem-loop by a seven nucleotide single-stranded linker. This structure, lacking the S2-L2 stem-loop and both the S3 and S4 helices, would not be able to form the pseudoknotted structure or the alternative two stem-loop structure that make up the putative molecular switch (Goebel et al., 2004), possibly accounting for the CD mutant's lethal phenotype. It is less clear from our modeling of the AB mutant why it is lethal. The three structures predicted by Mfold all maintain the S2-L2 stem-loop with the most stable predicted structure containing an additional bulge in S4 and a somewhat reconfigured and shorter S3 helix (see Fig. 1). These same altered S3 and S4 helices are predicted to be present singly in the A and B mutants, thus the predicted structure of the AB mutant does not provide a ready explanation for its lethal phenotype. It is also possible that the lethal AB and CD mutations perturb the equilibrium between the extended bulged stem-loop structure and the pseudoknotted structure to a degree that is incompatible with viability.",

This leads us to conclude that L3 might function as a linker between S3 and S4 with little sequence and length preference. Overall, the genetic studies of the 3\u2032UTR strongly support the Zust model. Several alternative secondary structures for this region of the 3\u2032UTR were proposed prior to the development of the current model. (Goebel et al., 2007, Johnson et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2001).

(Zust et al., 2008) introduced insertion mutations in the loop 1 (L1) sequence on the 5\u2032 side of the S3 stem and recovered second site suppressor mutations in the nsp8 and nsp9 proteins in viruses recovered after limited passage. Based on these results these authors speculated that the L1 loop plus the S3 helix might serve as a binding site for a primase complex containing the nsp8 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity (Imbert et al., 2006), and that this complex initiates minus sense RNA synthesis. In this model, once RNA synthesis had commenced from the 3\u2032 end of the genome the base pairing in S3 would be disrupted, allowing formation of the upstream pseudoknot (see Fig. 1), enabling assembly of a complete replicase complex containing the nsp12 RNA RdRp and other nsps to subsequently elongate the RNA primer. Sequencing of the nsp8 and nsp9 coding sequences of viable mutant viruses A, D, and ABC, all containing mutations predicted to disrupt a small portion of the S3 helix, failed to demonstrate second site suppressor mutations in nsp8 and nsp9 (data not shown). Similarly, sequencing of this region in all mutant F isolates failed to demonstrate second site mutations. Additionally, the RNA phenotype of all of the lethal mutations that we examined (AB, CD, H, and G; Figs. 2C and 4E) indicated that genomes with these mutations were able to direct the synthesis of negative sense RNAs corresponding to the genome but were not able to synthesize negative sense templates for subgenomic RNA synthesis. This result is generally consistent with a model for subgenomic RNA synthesis (Sola et al., 2005, Zuniga et al., 2004) that hypothesized that genome circularization mediated by RNA\u2013protein or RNA\u2013RNA interactions plays an important role in leader-body sequence joining during transcription of minus sense subgenomic RNAs, providing a role for the 3\u2032UTR in subgenomic RNA synthesis. It should be noted that the Zust (Zust et al., 2008) and Zuniga/Sola (Sola et al., 2005, Zuniga et al., 2004) models are not necessarily mutually exclusive and elements of both of them could explain the observed RNA phenotype of our mutants. Our data does not distinguish between these two models, but it does demonstrate that in either scenario the complex and very likely dynamic structure of the 3\u2032UTR is necessary for discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. Our studies do provide data supporting the idea that the 3\u2032UTR likely is a single functional unit consisting of several interacting structures.",

We hypothesized that these interactions might be necessary for the genome circulization postulated by the Zuniga/Sola (Sola et al., 2005, Zuniga et al., 2004) model to promote the switch between transcription and replication. A series of mutations were designed to investigate these hypothesized interactions between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs and we attempted to recover infectious virus harboring these mutations. These studies failed to support these hypothesized interactions (data not shown). Additional structural and biophysical studies to determine in detail the interactions of the various structures in the entire 3\u2032UTR and their dynamics are required to more fully understand their roles in viral replication.",

Mutant viruses containing the A and B mutations had previously been isolated by Johnson et al. (Johnson et al., 2005). Mutations creating small sequence disruptions of S3 and S4 (C, D, CD, ABC, ABD, and ABCD) were generated in a G plasmid template by site-directed mutagenesis; mutations creating larger sequence disruptions in S3, S4, and L3 (E, F, G, H, EH, FG, LRD, SLT2, SLT6) were generated by overlapping PCR with G plasmid as template. The sequences of mutagenic oligonucleotides are available on request. All mutated target sites were sequence verified and subcloned back into the original G plasmid as a 285 nt NruI-PacI fragment to obviate the potential for undesired mutants being present outside the 3\u2032UTR after site directed mutagenesis. The presence of the desired mutation was again verified by sequencing and these plasmids were subsequently used to regenerate infectious virus. Bacteria containing the seven plasmids (A\u2013G) making up the MHV-A59 reverse genetic system were propagated at 30 \u00b0C and plasmid DNA purified using a plasmid Midi prep kit from OMEGA BIO-TEK according to the manufacturer's protocol. The MHV cDNAs were excised from mutant and wild type G plasmids, gel purified, and ligated to MHV-A59 cDNAs A\u2013G to generate cDNAs corresponding to the entire MHV genome under the control of a T7 promoter. Full length cDNAs were in vitro transcribed using the Ambion mMessage mMachine T7 kit. Transcripts corresponding to the N gene coding sequence were also transcribed in vitro as described by Yount et al. (Yount et al., 2002). The N gene was mixed with the in vitro transcribed RNA and electroporated into BHK-R cells using a Biorad Gene Pulser. Electroporation was carried out three times at 0.85 kV. After electroporation, BHK-R cells were overlaid onto freshly seeded DBT cells in a T75 flask. Cultures were incubated for up to 3 days and monitored by phase microscopy for the development of cytopathic effect (CPE). Cultures that did not demonstrate CPE were blind passaged in DBT cells. A mutation was not considered to be lethal until at least 3 independent trials were performed, at least one of which was done at 34 \u00b0C and 39 \u00b0C to allow for recovery of temperature sensitive viruses. The cultures were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, sonicated, clarified by low speed centrifugation and virus plaque cloned on L2 cells. Individual plaques were then inoculated onto a confluent monolayer of DBT cells to generate small virus stocks. After maximal CPE developed the cell culture fluids were frozen at \u221280\u00b0 and RNA was extracted for later analysis.",
