To achieve this, we discuss: 1) the origins, evolution, and utility of the One Health approach as an organizational framework for interactions within and among professions, professional organizations, governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and educational institutions; 2) the short\u2010 and long\u2010term applications of One Health toward improving research and stewardship; and 3) the opportunities for members of SETAC to have greater involvement in One Health.\nAldo Leopold as a One Health Pioneer and TrailblazerAldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac: And Sketches Here and There\n21 spoke not only about a \u201cland ethic\u201d but also about land health. To Leopold, land health was encompassing, including myriad plants and animals. He defined land health as \u201cthe capacity of the land for self renewal,\u201d and he called conservation, \u201cour effort to understand and preserve this capacity.\u201d Leopold also talked about abuse of the land, and he described what he regarded as preferred outcomes from interventions. In Leopold's use and in other uses of the term health, values are necessary determinants of the prioritization of research, education, and stewardship. Ecological stewardship is a transdisciplinary approach to the development of preventive ecosystem and human health applications. It can serve as the basis for formulation of sustainable health approaches to protecting ecosystems and the environment. A recent report linked Leopold's ecocentric wisdom to human interests in the form of an inclusive view of public health needs 22. Land health was Leopold's clarion call to address the ecological challenges that influence health in the broader context.\n",

From ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome through the Renaissance and into the current modern era, similarities, differences, and taxonomic linkages among humans and other animals have formed the basis of comparative medicine. Moreover, the forefathers of medicine routinely observed, communicated, and urged avoidance of what they believed to be environmentally specific health stressors. For centuries, medical professionals cared for both humans and animals. In the 1700s, as medical specialties began to evolve, physicians established formal veterinary schools and led comparative physiology studies. By the mid\u20101800s, however, veterinarians asserted greater control in educating their own students, and a notable schism between the professions was underway. To a substantial degree, in the 20th and 21st centuries, the divisions between animal and human health professionals have abated, and specialists in these areas routinely share knowledge and skills from discoveries, techniques, and technologies 3. Unfortunately, there are few shared interventions for health protection (i.e., interventions that entail interdisciplinary and interinstitutional collaboration and communication), apart from those related to public health threats posed by direct interactions with domestic or wild animals (e.g., rabies, tuberculosis) or bacterial pathogens, such as Brucella spp. and Salmonella spp. in milk, meat, or eggs.",

To date, however, with few exceptions, the impacts of environmental contaminants on health and wellbeing have been largely left out of projects and programs organized under the banner of One Health 4.

For example, our bibliometric searches of titles, keywords, and abstracts revealed no papers that contained the term One Health published in the 2 SETAC journals.

In response to the growing health implications of environmental degradation, conservation medicine includes examining the relationship among 1) changes in climate, habitat quality, and land use; 2) emergence and re\u2010emergence of infectious agents, parasites, and environmental contaminants; and 3) maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functions as they sustain the health of plant and animal communities, including humans 12, 23.\nDisease is \u201cany impairment that interferes with or modifies the performance of normal functions, including responses to environmental factors such as nutrition, toxicants, and climate; infectious agents; inherent or congenital defects, or combinations of these factors\u201d 24.\nEcoHealth, or ecosystem approaches to health, is a systems\u2010based and participatory discipline to understand and promote health and well\u2010being in the context of social and ecological interactions. The pillars of EcoHealth are transdisciplinarity, participation, gender and social equity, systems thinking, sustainability, and research\u2010to\u2010action 25.\nHealth, as defined by the Ottawa Charter, is an ability to achieve goals and purpose: an individual or group must be able to identify and to realize aspirations, to satisfy needs, and to change or cope with the environment 26.\nOne Health is the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines\u2014working locally, nationally, and globally\u2014to attain optimal health for people, animals, plants, and our environment 1.\nTransdisciplinarity, or transdisciplinary thinking, employs perspectives and methods that transcend traditional disciplines, and engage both researchers and practitioners in addressing real\u2010world problems. Team members are required to share roles and systematically cross discipline boundaries to develop more holistic approaches that bridge ecosystem and human health boundaries. The primary purpose of this approach is to pool and integrate the team expertise so that more efficient and comprehensive assessment and intervention services may be provided in a determined field. The communication style in transdisciplinary thinking involves continuous give\u2010and\u2010take among all members on a regular, planned basis. The role differentiation between disciplines is defined by the needs of the situation rather than by discipline\u2010specific characteristics. Assessment, intervention, and evaluation are carried out jointly 27.\n",

The World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, and World Organisation for Animal Health, in a tripartite alliance, established interoperative governance structures for information exchange, early warning systems, and mechanisms to enhance coordination and support for member countries as they respond to natural disasters and disease emergencies. For example, the Global Early Warning and Response System for Major Animal Diseases houses zoonoses information in its database and combines the alert and response mechanisms of the 3 organizations to avoid duplication and to coordinate verification processes. To accelerate shared communications and data analyses related to important animal diseases, including zoonoses, the World Organisation for Animal Health developed the World Animal Health Information System and Database. The official notifications of the World Animal Health Information System not only are factored into the Global Early Warning and Response System for Major Animal Diseases, but also are in the public domain. Another example is the Network of Expertise on Animal Influenza organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health to support international monitoring and infection control. Moreover, links between the Network of Expertise on Animal Influenza and the World Health Organization's Global Influenza Programme are now strong, facilitating free exchanges of information and establishment of joint technical projects between the 2 networks. Additional local, state, and international systems that merge, analyze, and communicate findings from diagnostic confirmatory and real\u2010time syndromic surveillance on human and animal diseases are described in Uchtmann et al. 9.

In certain circumstances, deforestation, travel, globalization, climate change, and chemical pollution are catalysts behind ecological simplification, increased pathogen exposures, and immunosuppression that may all contribute to disease outbreaks 11, 12. Heavy impacts can be seen in na\u00efve populations of humans and animals that are exposed to infectious diseases. The epidemic of West Nile virus infections affected birds, horses, and other mammals (including humans), as the disease spread across the United States, from the Northeast south, westward, and into the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central and South America. West Nile virus affected humans and animals in several ways: through mild to lethal infections, through the impacts of massive pesticide spraying, and through loss of confidence in governmental health agencies when they demonstrated limited success in stopping spread of the disease. More recently, the spread of Ebola, affecting wildlife and humans in several nations of West Africa, triggered even greater concern because of the extraordinarily high case fatality rate in clinically affected people. Similarly, the Zika virus has garnered world\u2010wide attention because of its potential impacts on pregnant women and unborn children. Important modes of cross\u2010species contact were relevant in West Nile, Zika, and Ebola outbreaks, as well as in other infectious diseases that pose ongoing concerns. Transport related to trade and travel (e.g., via airplanes, ships, trains, buses, trucks, and automobiles) moves vectors and infected hosts more rapidly than in any previous era 13. Also of great importance are instances of direct transmission of pathogens from animals to humans that result from human encroachment into wildlife habitats. Settlements, roads, deforestation, and agriculture fragment and eliminate wildlife habitat, bringing humans, domestic animals, and wildlife into closer contact. Bush\u2010meat (i.e., wild game) collection, processing, and sales increase risks of direct pathogen transfers. One Health must include both infectious and toxicological diseases 14. Members of SETAC have expertise to provide on these issues, which includes chemically mediated immunosuppression, effective disease surveillance (including determinants of healthy environments), and antimicrobial resistance (the subject of a joint SETAC\u2013US State Department\u2013US Geological Survey workshop in fall 2016).",

The impacts of global environmental change on ecological processes include, for example, greatly increased precipitation in susceptible regions and more severe droughts in others; increased runoff of chemicals and erosion from severe storms and floods; coastal zones experiencing sea\u2010level rise and more severe surges from cyclones and hurricanes; and the inability of many species to adapt to rapid changes in climatic regimes, potentially resulting in population\u2010level impacts. A changing climate often results in disease transmission into new regions. Warmer climates promote the spread of vectors of infectious disease from more tropical ranges to temperate areas, as seen with such diseases as malaria, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, and dengue fever. In other instances, vectors are able to live at higher latitudes than in the past, carrying pathogens to immunologically na\u00efve species adapted to those areas 15. Members of SETAC have expertise to provide in One Health collaborations on issues for which a changing climate is a critical determinant 16, such as monitoring to inform ecological forecasting and amelioration of toxic algal blooms, which impact humans and wildlife and which are enhanced by cultural eutrophication 17.\nMercury: A Classic Example of Discovering Shared Risks After Extreme Damage to an Environment, Its Wildlife, Domestic Animal, and Human Populations\u2014A Problem Yet to be Brought Under ControlMercury poisoning remains a One Health concern because of decades of evidence of multispecies toxicity 28. The classic story of mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay, Japan, began with the use of mercury as a catalyst in 1932, but emissions grew more serious when a new co\u2010catalyst added in 1951 directly produced methyl mercury. Releases into the Bay were followed soon thereafter by observations of dead fish and fishermen complaining of reduced catches. By 1953, seabirds and crows spiraled into the sea, and the same year cats that consumed seafood from the Bay demonstrated severe incoordination and seizures. Then, in 1956, neurotoxicity was observed in children eating the seafood. In 1957, feeding the seafood to cats experimentally reproduced the syndrome. In 1959, the syndrome in children was diagnosed as methyl mercury poisoning, and the point source producer was identified in 1961; but the company continued releasing methyl mercury until 1968 28. Despite our knowledge of mercury's harm, it continues to pollute globally. The chemical is intentionally used in several products (e.g., compact fluorescent light bulbs, certain batteries) and activities (e.g., artisanal and small\u2010scale gold mining, mercury\u2010cell chloralkali process), and it remains a substantial byproduct of industrial activities such as coal\u2010fired utilities, cement manufacturing, and waste incinerators. To monitor and protect wildlife, domestic animal, and human health, an integrated and comprehensive One Health approach is needed. This is particularly required now, given the United Nations Environment Programme Minamata Convention on Mercury Pollution 29, which is the global legally binding instrument that aims to protect both human health and the environment from mercury.\n",

In addition, SETAC members have been active in reforms to the US Toxic Substances Control Act. The number of chemicals in need of assessment and the diversity of receptors make all of these efforts complex. Innovations in environmental and ecological toxicology should interlink different communities of toxicologists and ensure that potentially important voids in the toxicological literature are filled, that targeted monitoring for ambient concentrations of contaminants expands, and that important toxicological impacts are routinely and proactively avoided through One Health research.

A Pellston workshop entitled Interconnections Between Human Health and Ecological Integrity was held in 2000. Jointly sponsored by SETAC and the Society of Toxicology, the workshop was motivated by the concern of human\u2010health, environmental, and social scientists for the interconnections between the condition of natural ecosystems and human health 19. The goal of the workshop was to initiate substantive yet broadly considered explorations of these interconnections, including creative transdisciplinary approaches for solving environmental problems at this interface. Major themes included the biological basis of similarities and differences between human health and ecosystem quality; how the environment shapes the human sense of well\u2010being and vice versa; linkages among land\u2010use patterns, ecological degradation, and human health; and implications of interconnections among human health and ecological integrity for policy makers. One outcome of the workshop was the development of a conceptual model for mapping interconnections between human health and ecological integrity, considering both the natural system (comprising the physical environment and biota) and the social system (comprising culture and institutions). Each system delivers outputs to the other system. The social system, including elements such as economics, delivers pollution and other residuals to the natural system and value\u2010added goods and services to itself. The natural system, including elements such as natural resources, provides ecological goods and services to the social system, which together support human health and well\u2010being. These systems and their connections served as a foundation for a conceptual model for the strategic plan of the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, a unit of the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Office of Research and Development (Figure 2).",

For example, an epidemiologist trying to predict how changes in global climate will influence the distribution of a mosquito\u2010borne disease may assume that the ecological interactions that determine the distribution of the mosquito can be simplified by describing a range of temperature and precipitation conditions conducive to vector persistence. This specialist might be tempted to black\u2010box all biotic interactions affecting mosquito populations as external to a set of abiotic conditions, which can be described using remote sensing data and geographic information systems, rather than embracing both individual\u2010 and population\u2010based perspectives by scientists of different disciplines. The One Health approach can counteract the weakness of black\u2010box approaches by bringing experts on health together with specialists in behavioral sciences, ecology, wildlife, and vector populations, climate, geographic information systems, anthropology, mathematical modeling, toxicology, veterinary medicine, and public health to help develop visualization tools that better inform the public about hazards.",

Also, for the sake of efficiency, data entry will need to become nearly effortless across the board. Databases will need to be readily accessible in the public sphere to garner public understanding and support for astute and more timely management. One Health mapping programs should include distributions of humans; of domesticated, native, exotic, and invasive animals; and of plants, together with their respective syndromic and diagnostic health parameters, cities/towns, agricultural areas, managed forests, industries, mining and fossil fuel exploitation, buffers, wilderness, climate, and weather. The analyses should also point to existing and emerging health problems related to individual stressors and groups of stressors, data gaps, interventions, and indicators of recovery. Spatially explicit analyses should thereby reveal proximate causes, connections to underlying societal drivers, and how reliable triggers for effective mitigation and prevention can be applied. In addition, appropriate maps should draw attention to the need to extend the reach of professionals and paraprofessionals to underserved populations of plants, animals, and humans.",

The adverse health impacts at hand warrant an infusion of interest and effort on the part of a wide array of SETAC experts. A logical approach of One Health is to focus multiple disciplines on understanding and counteracting shared stressors in given localities.
