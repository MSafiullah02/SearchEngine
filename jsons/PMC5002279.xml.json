Homology and Phylogenetic analysis was also performed between the partial gene of the new genome and the reference based on amino acid similarity. For the adenovirus sequences in the fatal case and the control sample, we used an in-house, reference-based method. First, non-human reads were mapped to the adenoviridae reference database. These were constructed first to obtain the adeno-associated reads and to select a candidate reference genome. Second, the candidate reference genome was reduced with the threshold of sequence identity greater than 90 %. All the adeno-associated reads were mapped to the reduced reference genome. Third, we calculated entropy based on the mapping result. Mapped reference positions with sequence depths greater than 0.5 were used as the consensus base.

            "text": "\nSalivirus/klassevirus is a new family in the picornavirus that is associated with diarrhea, especially in children, and is often found in feces [7]. However, the clinical significance of this virus is not clear. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of infection with salivirus/klassevirus in respiratory samples, and the effect of klassevirus to humans remains unclear. Tae-Hee Han et al. [8] analyzed 142 nasopharyngeal samples in 2010, but did not detect any salivirus/klassevirus.",

This is the first salivirus/klassevirus case found that was associated with respiratory infection. The existence of the salivirus/klassevirus in the adenovirus infected child played a crucial role in the fatality and merits our attention to the need for additional studies. The first finding of salivirus/klassevirus in the respiratory sample may indicate that salivirus/klassevirus may be an etiologic agent of respiratory tract infections. It provides useful information for the clinical diagnosis of unexplained lethal infections, and expands our knowledge to the new family salivirus/klassevirus in the picornavirus. The government, disease control, and clinical workers should pay more attention to the study and control of this virus.",
