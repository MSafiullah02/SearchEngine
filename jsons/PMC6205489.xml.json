            "text": "To test the hypothesis that the NMD pathway recognizes CoV mRNAs, leading to their degradation, we first examined whether the inhibition of the NMD pathway by depleting NMD factors promotes CoV replication from transfected viral genomic RNA. If CoV genomic RNA is a substrate of the NMD pathway, then depletion of NMD factors would prevent the NMD-mediated degradation of the transfected genomic RNA, resulting in efficient virus replication. In the present study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototypic member of the CoV family belonging to the same genus (Betacoronavirus) as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Treatment of 17Cl-1 cells [a mouse fibroblast cell line (18)] with specific siRNAs for different NMD factors, including UPF1, UPF2, SMG5, and SMG6, but not control siRNAs, substantially reduced the levels of the target NMD factors (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). To examine the effect of depletion of these NMD factors on the NMD pathway, 17Cl-1 cells were transfected with an NMD reporter plasmid, NS39, or a WT reporter plasmid. Both NS39 and WT reporter plasmids encode the Renilla luciferase (rLuc) gene fused to the \u03b2-globin gene with or without a PTC, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B); both transcripts undergo splicing, and the NS39 reporter transcript, but not the WT reporter transcript, is a target of NMD (19). Quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed a lower accumulation of NS39 reporter transcripts than WT reporter transcripts in control siRNA-transfected cells, confirming the degradation of NS39 reporter transcripts by the NMD pathway (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). An increase in the accumulation of the NS39 reporter transcripts (relative to WT reporter transcripts) in cells depleted of UPF1, UPF2, SMG5, or SMG6 demonstrated the inhibition of the NMD pathway in these cells. We transfected these NMD-deficient cells with MHV genomic RNA and determined the number of cells positive for MHV M protein and the released virus titers at 24 h postinoculation (p.i.). The number of M protein-positive cells (Fig. 1A) and the virus titers (Fig. 1B) were both substantially higher in cells depleted of NMD factors, demonstrating that the NMD pathway inhibited virus replication from the transfected MHV genomic RNA. As UPF1 and UPF2 are core components of the NMD machinery (20, 21), we chose the depletion of these factors in 17Cl-1 cells to generate NMD-deficient cells in subsequent studies.",

Cells that had been treated with control siRNAs (NMD-competent) or with siRNAs for UPF1 or UPF2 (NMD-deficient) were transfected with MHV genomic RNA. After 1 h of incubation and washing to remove free genomic RNAs, we extracted total intracellular RNAs from the 1-h sample. To examine the kinetics of degradation of viral genomic RNA after transfection, intracellular RNAs were also extracted from NMD-deficient and NMD-competent cells at 3, 5, and 7 h posttransfection. Quantitative analyses of the genomic RNA determined by qRT-PCR showed no substantial increase in the levels of genomic RNA in the NMD-competent cells during the 7-h incubation period (Fig. 2A, Left). These data suggest that viral RNA synthesis from the transfected genomic RNA was not efficient within the first 7 h after posttransfection, which allowed us to determine the degradation kinetics of the transfected viral genomic RNA. We observed a significantly delayed degradation kinetics of the transfected genomic RNA in NMD-deficient cells compared with NMD-competent cells (Fig. 2A, Left). These data suggest that MHV genomic RNA is a substrate of the NMD pathway, which recognizes and degrades the transfected genomic RNA.",

We used two pharmacological NMD inhibitors, cycloheximide (CHX) and wortmannin. CHX is a translation inhibitor that inhibits NMD because it is a translation-dependent event (21); wortmannin inhibits NMD by preventing SMG1-mediated UPF1 phosphorylation (22, 23), a critical step in the NMD pathway. After genomic RNA transfection, we incubated the cells with CHX, wortmannin, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the solvent used for dissolving the inhibitors, and determined the levels of the genomic RNA at 3 h posttransfection (Fig. 2A, Right); the levels of the genomic RNA at 1 h posttransfection represented the input genomic RNA. The levels of the genomic RNA at 3 h posttransfection were significantly higher in cells treated with the NMD inhibitors, confirming that the transfected MHV genomic RNA was a target of the NMD pathway.",

To test whether CoV subgenomic mRNAs are also targets of the NMD pathway, we transfected an in vitro-synthesized, capped, and polyadenylated MHV subgenomic RNA 3-like reporter transcript, rLucRNA3, carrying the rLuc ORF instead of the MHV S protein ORF, and examined its stability in NMD-competent and NMD-deficient cells (Fig. 2B, Left). Similar to MHV genomic RNA, the transfected rLucRNA3 exhibited a longer half-life in NMD-deficient cells compared to NMD-competent cells (Fig. 2B, Left). Also, the levels of the transfected rLucRNA3 were higher in cells treated with NMD inhibitors (Fig. 2B, Right).

To generate capped rLucRNA3 transcripts in the cytoplasm, we cotransfected 17Cl-1 cells with four expression plasmids in the experimental group\u2014a plasmid encoding T7 polymerase (24), two plasmids encoding the vaccinia virus capping enzymes D1R and D12L (25\u201328), and a rLucRNA3 plasmid carrying the rLucRNA3 sequence\u2014downstream of a T7 promoter and upstream of a poly(A) sequence, hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and T7 terminator. We expected that the expressed T7 RNA polymerase, along with the vaccinia virus capping enzymes, would drive the synthesis of capped and polyadenylated rLucRNA3 transcripts in the cytoplasm (29). As a control group, the plasmids expressing vaccinia virus capping enzymes were omitted, which would result in the generation of uncapped and polyadenylated rLucRNA3 transcripts. Although similar levels of rLucRNA3 transcripts were synthesized in both groups, the rLuc reporter activities were higher in the experimental group than in the control group (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), suggesting the generation of capped rLucRNA3 transcripts in the experimental group and resulting in the efficient cap-dependent translation of the rLuc reporter protein from the capped transcripts. To test whether the cytoplasmically generated rLucRNA3 transcripts can serve as a substrate of the NMD pathway, we examined the stability of rLucRNA3 transcripts in control siRNA-treated cells (NMD-competent) or in cells depleted of UPF1 or UPF2 (NMD-deficient). We treated the cells with actinomycin D (actD) at 20 h posttransfection to prevent new RNA synthesis, and examined the levels of preexisting rLucRNA3 transcripts at 0, 2, and 4 h after actD addition (Fig. 3A). We observed a significantly delayed degradation kinetics of rLucRNA3 transcripts in NMD-deficient cells compared with NMD-competent cells, suggesting that the cytoplasmically synthesized rLucRNA3 transcripts are recognized and degraded by the NMD pathway. To examine whether the targeting of cytoplasmically generated RNA transcripts by the NMD pathway is specific for capped rLucRNA3 and not for any cytoplasmically generated capped RNA, we performed similar experiments described above using a plasmid expressing GLA mRNA instead of the plasmid expressing rLucRNA3.

We examined whether MHV replication protects the NS39 reporter mRNA from NMD using these stable cell lines. In the absence of MHV infection, the levels of NS39 reporter transcripts were lower than those of WT reporter transcripts due to the degradation of NS39 reporter transcripts by NMD (Mock in Fig. 4A). We observed a statistically significant increase in the level of NS39 reporter transcripts (relative to that of WT reporter transcripts) in MHV-infected cells at 7 h p.i. (Fig. 4A).

We hypothesized that one of the viral structural proteins associated with the incoming virions would possess an NMD inhibitory function to protect the incoming MHV genomic RNA from NMD. We established a simple assay system to determine whether one of the viral structural proteins displayed an activity to inhibit NMD. Cells were cotransfected with NS39 reporter plasmid (encoding NS39 reporter transcripts) or WT reporter plasmid (encoding WT reporter transcripts) along with a pCMV-fLuc plasmid [expressing firefly luciferase (fLuc) transcripts], and with plasmids encoding either chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or the nonstructural protein 1 of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV nsp1), an alphaCoV; CAT and TGEV nsp1 carried a C-terminal myc tag. We hypothesized that TGEV nsp1 would inhibit the NMD pathway because it inhibits host translation without affecting the stability of host mRNAs (37)\u2014and NMD is a translation-dependent event. At 40 h posttransfection, we examined the levels of WT and NS39 reporter transcripts relative to those of fLuc transcripts. The level of NS39 reporter transcripts was higher in TGEV nsp1-expressing cells than in CAT-expressing cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), demonstrating that TGEV nsp1 inhibited the NMD pathway. Similar experiments, using a plasmid encoding one of the MHV structural proteins (M, N, E, or S) in place of the plasmid encoding TGEV nsp1, showed that N protein expression caused a statistically significant increase in the level of NS39 reporter transcripts, demonstrating that MHV N protein inhibited the NMD pathway (Fig. 5A). To rule out the possibility that the inhibition of the NMD pathway by MHV N protein was due to its indirect effect on translation, we examined whether N protein expression inhibited translation by determining the levels of fLuc transcripts and fLuc reporter activities in the cells expressing the different MHV structural proteins (Fig. 5B). The levels of fLuc transcripts and fLuc reporter activities were similar among the samples, with no statistically significant difference, except in the case of TGEV nsp1 expression that resulted in a lower fLuc reporter activity due to its translation inhibition function. MHV N protein expression resulted in a slightly higher fLuc reporter activity. These data show that N protein inhibited the NMD pathway without suppressing translation.",

To test the possibility that MHV mRNAs synthesized early in infection are susceptible to NMD, we inoculated MHV into cells treated with control siRNAs (NMD-competent) or with siRNAs for UPF1 or UPF2 (NMD-deficient) and examined the levels of viral mRNAs at different times p.i.

Treatment with E64d causes a reduction in the rate of RNA synthesis, which allowed us to measure the NMD-mediated turnover of newly synthesized mRNA 1 by comparing its levels in MHV-infected cells treated with the NMD inhibitor wortmannin or DMSO at 6 h p.i. First, we tested the effect of E64d treatment on MHV RNA synthesis and found that it efficiently inhibited, albeit incompletely, the synthesis of mRNA 1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). Furthermore, E64d-mediated inhibition of viral mRNA synthesis also severely inhibited the accumulation of MHV N protein (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B), excluding the effect of its role as an NMD inhibitor in our experimental approach. Importantly, E64d treatment did not inhibit the NMD pathway (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C). These data show the feasibility of using E64d in our experiment to inhibit viral mRNA synthesis. We treated MHV-infected cells with E64d and wortmannin or with E64d and DMSO from 4 to 6 h p.i., and measured the levels of mRNA 1 at 4 and 6 h p.i. (Fig. 7E). The level of mRNA 1 was significantly higher in E64d-treated cells incubated with wortmannin than in those incubated with DMSO. To exclude the possibility that wortmannin treatment promoted viral mRNA synthesis, leading to higher levels of accumulation of mRNA 1, we examined the effect of wortmannin treatment on mRNA 1 accumulation in the absence of E64d. The level of mRNA 1 was slightly lower, although not statistically significantly, in wortmannin-treated cells than in DMSO-treated cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S6D), strongly suggesting that wortmannin treatment did not facilitate viral mRNA synthesis. Our data suggest that NMD inhibition by wortmannin in E64d-treated cells protects the newly synthesized mRNA 1 from degradation, resulting in its higher level of accumulation.",

            "text": "The present study investigated the interplay between CoVs and the NMD pathway by using MHV as a prototypic CoV. We show that inhibition of the NMD pathway, by the depletion of NMD factors, significantly delayed the degradation of the transfected MHV genomic RNA, thereby facilitating efficient virus replication (Fig. 1). Depletion of NMD factors also delayed the rapid degradation of transfected rLucRNA3, a viral subgenomiclike mRNA (Fig. 2), as well as cytoplasmically synthesized rLucRNA3 (Fig. 3). Pharmacological inhibition of the NMD pathway, using CHX and wortmannin, also inhibited the decay of transfected genomic RNA and rLucRNA3 (Fig. 2) as well as cytoplasmically synthesized rLucRNA3 (Fig. 3), establishing that MHV mRNAs are targets of the NMD pathway. We also reveal that MHV replication inhibited the NMD pathway before the onset of virus-induced translation inhibition (Fig. 4). It should be noted that efficient viral protein synthesis continued even after the induction of host protein synthesis inhibition (Fig. 4C). Because the actively translating viral mRNAs would be susceptible to NMD, our data suggest that MHV-induced inhibition of the NMD pathway is important for efficient viral gene expression. We identified MHV N protein as an inhibitor of the NMD pathway (Fig. 5). However, our data did not exclude the possibility of other MHV proteins (including gene 1 or accessory proteins) possessing the activity to inhibit the NMD pathway. Although MHV N protein also protected transfected viral genomic RNA and rLucRNA3 from rapid degradation (Fig. 6), providing indirect evidence for its role in protecting viral mRNAs from NMD in infected cells, our data do not rule out the possibility that N protein protected the viral mRNAs from other RNA decay pathways. Subsequently, our studies revealed that early in infection, before the efficient accumulation of N protein, newly synthesized MHV mRNAs 1 and 3 are susceptible to NMD and that inhibition of the NMD pathway by the depletion of NMD factors promoted the accumulation of viral mRNAs early in infection, leading to the production of higher titers of MHV (Fig. 7). Together, the present study\u2019s results strongly suggest that the NMD pathway recognizes and targets MHV mRNAs for degradation and that the inhibition of the NMD pathway, mediated by MHV N protein, is important for efficient virus replication.",

Genomic-wide siRNA screening for host factors involved in the replication of Semliki forest virus (SFV), an alphavirus, in mammalian cells (16) and a genetic screen in Arabidopsis for factors involved in the replication of Potato virus X (PVX), a positive-strand RNA virus in plants (13), led to the discovery of the role of NMD factors in the replication of these cytoplasmic RNA viruses. Like CoVs, these viruses carry a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome with a long 3\u2032 UTR and produce one or more subgenomic mRNAs that form a nested-set structure in infected cells. In the case of retroviruses, the viral mRNAs are synthesized in the nucleus and many of them undergo splicing; therefore, it is not surprising that retroviruses have evolved to control the NMD pathway. Rous sarcoma virus, an avian retrovirus, carries an RNA stability element that facilitates the escape of full-length viral RNA (carrying a long 3\u2032 UTR) from degradation by the NMD pathway (40). Human T-lymphotropic virus type I encodes the NMD inhibitors Tax and Rex, which prolong the half-life of viral mRNAs (41, 42), whereas the NMD factor UPF1 serves as a positive regulator of HIV type 1 replication (43\u201345).",

Our data showing that MHV mRNAs of cytoplasmic origin, which do not undergo splicing and lack EJC, are also targeted by the NMD pathway suggest that the NMD pathway is able to recognize and target mRNAs that lack canonical NMD-inducing features. Nonetheless, the recognition and targeting of mRNAs of cytoplasmic origin by the NMD pathway followed some fundamental principles that govern the turnover of mammalian mRNAs by NMD, including the requirement of NMD factors UPF1, UPF2, SMG5, and SMG6; UPF1 phosphorylation; and the translation of target mRNAs (Figs. 1\u20133). However, it is unclear whether other NMD factors that play a critical role in the NMD of mammalian mRNAs are also required for NMD-mediated turnover of CoV mRNAs. Further studies are warranted to identify the host factors that are involved in the targeting of cytoplasmically synthesized viral mRNAs by the NMD pathway.",

It is conceivable that many cytoplasmic RNA viruses have evolved to evade the NMD pathway altogether by eliminating NMD-inducing RNA features from the viral mRNAs. One of the NMD-inducing features in mammalian mRNAs is the presence of a long 3\u2032 UTR (10, 13, 14). It has been demonstrated that the long 3\u2032 UTR of subgenomic RNA of PVX is targeted by the NMD pathway (13), but shortening the length of the 3\u2032 UTR in alphavirus genomic RNA did not protect the RNA from NMD (16), suggesting the presence of one or more additional NMD-inducing features in the alphavirus genomic RNA. We observed that the transfected or cytoplasmically synthesized rLucRNA3, but not GLA mRNA, was susceptible to NMD, suggesting that the long 3\u2032 UTR is one of the NMD-activating features in rLucRNA3 that triggered its NMD-mediated degradation (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, the inhibition of the NMD pathway promoted the accumulation of viral mRNAs early in infection, with the effect being more pronounced for longer viral mRNAs (Fig. 7). These data are also consistent with the long 3\u2032 UTR being one of the NMD-activating features in susceptible mRNAs (10, 13, 14), which implies that the long 3\u2032 UTR in cytoplasmically synthesized mRNAs, including CoV mRNAs, is a trigger for NMD. Because the cytoplasmically generated rLucRNA3 transcripts were susceptible to NMD (Fig. 3), these transcripts can be used to delineate the NMD-inducing RNA features in CoV mRNAs.",

In alphavirus, the SFV mutant lacking the C-terminal part of nsp3 was more susceptible to UPF1-mediated degradation (16), although it is unclear whether nsp3 has an NMD inhibitory function. The core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) binds to an EJC recycling factor and prevents the factor from interacting with other components of the EJC, leading to the inhibition of the NMD pathway in infected cells (17). Unlike in the case of MHV genomic RNA, UPF1 depletion does not affect the stability of transfected HCV genomic RNA (47). However, these data do not rule out the possibility of HCV genomic RNA as a target of NMD, because the core protein, synthesized from the transfected HCV genomic RNA, could have protected the HCV genomic RNA from NMD. Currently, the biological significance of NMD inhibition in HCV replication is unclear. Our present study shows that MHV replication inhibited the NMD pathway (Fig. 4) and reveals the role of MHV N protein as an NMD inhibitor (Fig. 5) that protects transfected viral mRNA or viruslike mRNA from rapid degradation (Fig. 6). Our data also strongly suggest that the inhibition of the NMD pathway is important for the protection of viral mRNAs from rapid decay, thereby facilitating efficient virus replication (Fig. 7). Hence, our study highlights the biological importance of the NMD pathway in controlling the stability of mRNAs of a cytoplasmic RNA virus. Our study also directly demonstrates the recognition and targeting of mRNAs of a cytoplasmic RNA virus by the NMD pathway, highlighting the importance of virus-mediated subversion of the NMD pathway for efficient replication of a cytoplasmic RNA virus.",

            "text": "In addition to our main finding that MHV mRNAs are vulnerable to the NMD pathway, we also reveal the role of MHV N protein as an inhibitor of the NMD pathway. It has been shown that in CoV reverse genetics systems, the addition of transcripts encoding N protein to in vitro-synthesized full-length CoV transcripts for electroporation enhances the recovery of infectious viruses (48\u201351). It is possible that the N protein, translated from the transcripts, plays a role in protecting the full-length CoV transcripts from NMD, facilitating the efficient recovery of CoVs. As the mRNAs of all CoVs carry the NMD-activating features (i.e., the presence of multiple ORFs and a long 3\u2032 UTR), it is highly likely that the NMD inhibition function is a common biological property of CoV N protein. Because the genomes of all members of the order Nidovirales, including CoVs and arteriviruses, share these NMD-activating features, it is conceivable to speculate that in addition to MHV, the mRNAs of other nidoviruses are also a target of the NMD pathway and that nidoviruses have evolved to encode a viral protein that inhibits the NMD pathway. Analyses of the cellular interactome of the CoV infectious bronchitis virus N protein (52) and that of the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus N protein (53) suggested an interaction of these N proteins with UPF1. However, the biological significance of these putative interactions has not been examined. It is tempting to speculate that CoV N protein binds and sequesters UPF1 away from the NMD machinery, resulting in the inhibition of the NMD pathway. It would be valuable and significant to clarify the mechanism of N protein-mediated NMD inhibition, as disrupting the NMD inhibitory function of N protein would represent an avenue for controlling CoV replication.",

There is accumulating evidence suggesting an active role for the NMD pathway in the regulation of immune responses and the inhibition of the NMD pathway under various cellular stress conditions, including infection (20).
