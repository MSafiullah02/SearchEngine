Heterogeneity among individuals can be quantified by comparing the variability among individuals to that expected by chance. When transmission events can be observed directly (eg through contact tracing), one approach is to estimate the effective reproductive number R\neff (the average number of new infections resulting from an original infection) for a population, and then to compare the number of secondary infections caused by individuals to a Poisson distribution with mean R\neff (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005).",

Each element of the R matrix describes transmission among one pair of host groups as the product of the mean infectious contact rate and the mean infectious period.

If vertical transmission is absent, all other elements in the matrix are zero (Dobson and Foufopoulos 2001). As a result, the contribution of each host group j to initial amplification can be written as\nHere, fj is the fraction of vectors feeding on host species j, Nj is the fraction of the total host community represented by host species j, Cj is the competence (including susceptibility, infectiousness, and infectious period) of host group j, and R\n0 is the sum across all j groups multiplied by the square of the vector biting rate and vector abundance. The importance in amplification, Aj, of each host group relative to its abundance is then Aj = (R\n0,j/R\n0)/Nj. To determine whether a host group is likely to be a superspreader at the nth percentile requires determining whether the observed value of Aj is unlikely given an expectation of Aj = 1 and the measurement error associated with estimating (R\n0,j/R\n0) and Nj. This entails determining the probability of observing the estimated value of Aj by comparing it to the ratio of two distributions that have identical means equal to Nj but possibly different variances as determined by the measurement error of (R\n0,j/R\n0) and Nj. The most appropriate distribution for Nj and (R\n0,j/R\n0) for this comparison will be an important problem for further study, but one possibility is to use beta distributions, which are flexible and vary between 0 and 1. For non\u2010vector\u2010borne pathogens, a priori quantification of importance is much more challenging because empirically measuring the infectious contact rate among hosts is difficult. If possible, identifying measurable surrogates for infectious contact rates would aid discovery of host traits that are correlated with contact rates.\n",

This value represents the average number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in an immunologically na\u00efve host population (Anderson and May 1991). Subsequent work has shown that the intensity of macroparasitic infections (eg worms per individual) generally follows a negative binomial distribution with high skew (Shaw and Dobson 1995), with more highly infected individuals potentially being responsible for more transmission events. A later study proposed the \u201c20/80\u201d rule and showed that, in a variety of disease systems, 20% of hosts were responsible for at least 80% of transmission events (Woolhouse et al. 1997). Thus, models allowing for heterogeneity in the distribution of the expected number of new infections an infectious individual produces (rather than using a single mean value, R\n0) have transformed the epidemiological modeling of diseases by taking into account changes in disease dynamics that result from such heterogeneities (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005). Importantly, heterogeneous transmission also occurs in cases where amplification host species or environmental \u201chotspots\u201d contribute disproportionately to disease transmission within a community or landscape (Figure 1). Thus, one of the major goals of this paper is to extend the same principles that underlie host transmission heterogeneity to understand landscape variability in disease risk.",

Traits such as host age, sex, body condition, and genetics can influence all three of these characteristics by affecting host susceptibility, immune responses, or social behavior (Wilson et al. 2001; Altizer et al. 2003; Hudson et al. 2008; Beldomenico and Begon 2010). For instance, experimental manipulations in birds and rodents have shown that males can be important drivers of population\u2010level infection rates, and that elevated testosterone levels can suppress the immune response while increasing host contact rates (Ferrari et al. 2004; Mougeot et al. 2005; Grear et al. 2009).",

Factors such as genetic differences in host resistance or parasite virulence and genotype\u2013environment interactions can lead to individual transmission heterogeneity. For example, experimental inoculations of bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) leaves with Phytophthora ramorum, the fungal pathogen that causes sudden oak death syndrome, showed that individual trees varied substantially in their genetic susceptibility to the pathogen (measured by mean lesion area; Anacker et al. 2008). However, field observations revealed that disease levels (measured as number of symptomatic leaves per tree) at the plot scale were primarily associated with local environmental differences in temperature and precipitation rather than with genetic differences among hosts (Anacker et al. 2008). The distribution of pathogens or vectors within the environment may also be a factor influencing host burdens and, by extension, transmission heterogeneity (Brunner and Ostfeld 2008). For instance, when parasites are clumped together rather than scattered evenly across the environment, individuals that happen to encounter the areas with higher parasite densities are likely to experience higher infection intensities as a result.",

Additionally, immune system trade\u2010offs in response to different types of pathogens (eg microparasites versus macroparasites) can increase the duration and intensity of infection in individuals harboring multiple pathogen types (Graham et al. 2007; Telfer et al. 2010; Hawley and Altizer 2011). Co\u2010infection may also reduce transmission potential as a result of cross\u2010immunity and the contact\u2010reducing behaviors of infected hosts (Rohani et al. 2003; Hawley and Altizer 2011).

Even more effective control is possible when individuals with the potential for disproportionate transmission can be predicted before infecting others (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005; Hudson et al. 2008), for example based on host characteristics such as weight or sex (eg Perkins et al. 2003).

For example, experimental exposure of six grass species to barley yellow dwarf virus suggested that plants with a \u201cquick return\u201d phenotype (eg high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as high metabolic rates in leaves) had increased host susceptibility, competence, and vector population sizes, most likely because their leaves offered more resources for vector and pathogen growth and generally had fewer defenses (Cronin et al. 2010). Such hosts enhance the population of infected vectors, increasing infection risk for co\u2010occurring host species. Species that tend to have high population densities or show highly social behavior may also be at increased risk of contracting pathogens for which transmission is dependent on host density, resulting from higher contact rates (Altizer et al. 2003).

A species responsible for more infections than the nth percentile of the expected distribution can be classified as a community superspreader (Panel 1; eg Kilpatrick et al. 2006). When identifying superspreading species, the transmission event of interest should be defined explicitly. This could include transmission that is either intra\u2010 or interspecific, or to a host species of particular interest (eg humans or domestic animals), depending on the research or management objective. For WNV, Kilpatrick et al.

Similarly, Farnsworth et al.

For instance, poor habitat quality and populations isolated in fragmented habitats can cause stress and reduced genetic diversity in host populations, thereby reducing host immunity and resulting in spatial variability in transmission potential across the landscape (Pearman and Garner 2005; Bradley and Altizer 2007). Nutrient enrichment can also elevate disease risk through changes to pathogen abundance and virulence, host and vector densities, or host susceptibility (Johnson et al. 2010). For example, a study in Belize showed that nutrient enrichment of water bodies associated with agricultural areas supports different aquatic plant communities that promote breeding by an efficient malaria vector, Anopheles vestitipennis (Grieco et al. 2006).

Similarly, aggregation of children in schools enhances transmission of childhood diseases, such as measles (eg Bj\u00f8rnstad et al. 2002). Social animal behaviors that tend to aggregate and increase contacts between hosts, such as those that occur at collective mating grounds (eg leks), overwintering dens, watering holes, and feeding sites, can also elevate disease transmission at those sites (Altizer et al. 2003, 2006). Cultural differences in human behavior can also influence disease transmission by shifting host\u2013pathogen contact rates (Alexander and McNutt 2010). For instance, regional differences in caregiving and nursing techniques may have contributed in part to differences in the rates of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and mortality from Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh as compared with those in Malaysia (Chong et al. 2008), creating regional heterogeneity in disease transmission.",

Extreme levels of spatial transmission heterogeneity might lead to environmental hotspots that are analogous to superspreaders (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005), in that such patches are responsible for greater than the nth percentile of the expected fraction of regional transmission events (Panel 1). It is particularly important with spatial transmission heterogeneity to explicitly identify the transmission measure of interest before assessing the importance of transmission heterogeneity to disease dynamics. The relevant measure of transmission for habitat patches will depend on the management scenario and could include, for example, the number of farms infected by a single farm (Keeling et al. 2001) or the number of host infections that occur in spatially defined areas.",

Nonetheless, several issues surrounding the consequences of interspecific and spatial transmission heterogeneity for outbreak probabilities and epidemic trajectories are important avenues for future research (Panel 2). In addition, new theory for understanding when to expect transmission heterogeneity will improve disease mitigation strategies. Management could also be enhanced by identifying and addressing connections between host and spatial heterogeneity. Finally, it will be important to develop new strategies for identifying the most infectious hosts and landscapes, and new management tools to reduce their contribution to transmission.",

            "text": "Integration of previous research suggests several hypotheses regarding the causes of heterogeneous transmission patterns and the pathogen transmission modes most likely involved. For instance, we hypothesize that heterogeneity in contact rates is more important than heterogeneity in infectiousness for creating superspreaders, because in an age of globalized travel and practices that increase host density, such as industrialized farming and habitat fragmentation, contact rates may vary more than infectivity. Another testable hypothesis is that specific pathogen transmission modes are more commonly associated with certain types of transmission heterogeneity. For instance, transmission variability across hosts may be more common among infections transmitted through vectors or direct host\u2010to\u2010host contact; this is because there are no intermediate transmission steps (eg to other obligate host species) that would dilute the influence of variable contact rates, competence, or infectivity on overall transmission. Environmental transmission heterogeneity may be more prevalent among pathogens with density\u2010dependent transmission or environmentally transmitted stages, because transmission foci are often characterized by high host or pathogen densities. Empirical testing of these hypotheses will require quantitative approaches for identifying transmission heterogeneity (Panel 1) in addition to meta\u2010analyses that integrate the results from multiple studies.",

            "text": "Connections between host and spatial transmission heterogeneity are likely common and could have implications for disease management. Logically, superspreaders create hotspots of transmission around them, and hosts in a disease hotspot, by definition, experience increased infection pressure as compared with others in the population. For example, interspecific transmission heterogeneities in Lyme disease can theoretically lead to environmental hotspots because fragmented habitats often support a higher fraction of competent amplification hosts, which could increase disease risk (eg measured as nymph infection prevalence) in disturbed landscapes (LoGiudice et al. 2003). Environmental hotspots that occur as a result of temporary aggregation of hosts \u2013 for example, at a watering hole \u2013 could also facilitate individual superspreading by serving as a source location for infection among highly social individuals that disperse from the location and subsequently infect many others. Finally, heterogeneity occurs both among and within species, and amplification species may contain one or more superspreading individuals. For example, domestic dogs account for the majority of rabies cases in parts of rural Tanzania; infected dogs vary substantially in their biting rates, such that in addition to being the dominant amplification host in the system, some domestic dogs account for a disproportionate number of canine rabies transmission events (Hampson et al. 2009). These patterns suggest that a priority for future research in disease ecology should be the development of a framework integrating transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space (Panel 2).",

            "text": "Perhaps the most practical information about transmission heterogeneity from a management perspective is determining what measures may be useful for identifying the most infectious individuals, species, and locations so that they can be targeted before infecting others. If, as hypothesized, contact rates play the greatest role in transmission heterogeneity, then quantifying contact networks representing the set of interactions between nodes (eg individuals, species, or environments) could provide a surrogate measure for identifying potential superspreaders (Figure 3; eg Keeling and Eames 2005), particularly if traits characteristic of the highest contact nodes can be identified. Importantly, specific characteristics, such as the duration of infectiousness and contact, must be considered to determine the role of high contact nodes (eg Craft et al. 2011). Additionally, because infectiousness frequently co\u2010varies with susceptibility (Hudson et al. 2008; Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2008), another potential indicator for identifying possible superspreaders and amplification hosts could involve measures of susceptibility such as body condition, testosterone level, or immunocompetence (Beldomenico and Begon 2010). Identifying the most infectious hosts before they infect others offers a superior management strategy to post hoc analyses that detect such hosts from infection levels or transmission studies; however, recognizing these individuals and determining the probability that they will become infected can be challenging. Intriguingly, advanced tools, such as therapeutic interfering particles (particles engineered to replicate along with the pathogen, but that inhibit pathogen growth), can eliminate the challenges of identifying superspreaders a priori because they are transmitted among hosts along with the pathogen, naturally making their way to the most high\u2010risk populations (Metzger et al. 2011). Further research that identifies the conditions under which easily observable host or landscape traits are associated with high transmission rates will aid targeted disease control efforts.",

Addressing critical questions about when host and spatial transmission heterogeneities are stochastically generated or temporally variable and what the implications are for disease dynamics and host\u2013pathogen evolution will require the integration of modeling and empirical approaches (Panel 2).
