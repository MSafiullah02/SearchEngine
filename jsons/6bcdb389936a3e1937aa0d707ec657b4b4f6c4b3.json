Here, a nested reverse transcription (RT)-PCR approach for the detection of PDCoV was developed to identify and characterize aetiologic agent(s) associated with diarrhoeal diseases in piglets in South Korea. A PCR-based method was applied to investigate the presence of PDCoV in 683 diarrhoeic samples collected from 449 commercial pig farms in South Korea from January 2014 to December 2016. The molecular-based survey indicated a relatively high prevalence of PDCoV (19.03%) in South Korea. Among those, the monoinfection of PDCoV (9.66%) and co-infection of PDCoV (6.30%) with porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PEDV) were predominant in diarrhoeal samples.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the entire genome and spike protein sequences of these strains indicated that they are most closely related to other Korean isolates grouped with the US strains. However, Korean PDCoV strains formed different branches within the same cluster, implying continuous evolution in the field. Our data will advance the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary characteristics of PDCoV circulating in South Korea.",

This disease is symptomatically comparable to, but reportedly milder than, other porcine enteric coronavirus diseases caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), with lower mortality rates in affected neonatal piglets . PDCoV belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. PDCoV is a large, enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 25.4-kb long with a 5 0 cap and a 3 0 polyadenylated tail, which is the smallest genome size among porcine coronaviruses (de Groot et al., 2011; Woo et al., 2012) . The PDCoV genome consists of only six canonical coronaviral genes, except for open reading frame (ORF) 3, in the following conserved order: 5 0 untranslated region (UTR)-ORF1a-ORF1b-S-E-M-N-3 0 UTR. ORF1a and 1b occupy the 5 0 -proximal two-thirds of the genome encoding two overlapping viral replicase polyproteins, 1a and 1ab, which are proteolytically processed into mature non-structural proteins (nsps).",

Although the origin of PDCoV in the US remains unclear, sequence analyses suggest the possible introduction of a Chinese PDCoV strain into US swine (Li et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) . However, recent retrospective evaluation revealed that PDCoV antibodies could be detected in archival serum samples collected in 2010, suggesting that the virus may have already existed as early as 2010 (Thachil, Gerber, Xiao, Huang, & Opriessnig, 2015) . Shortly after its emergence in the US, PDCoV was also detected in South Korea from two diarrhoea samples independently collected in April and June 2014, which were positive for porcine rotavirus (PRV) and negative for other enteric viruses, respectively (Lee & Lee, 2014) .",

Moreover, the infection patterns of PDCoV in Korean swine farms currently remain to be determined. To accomplish this, a nested RT-PCR for detection of PDCoV was developed and employed to screen 684 diarrhoeal samples of pigs collected from 449 Korean swine farms from January 2014 to December 2016. Clinical samples that tested positive for PDCoV by RT-PCR were further subjected to sequencing analysis. The results of our BLAST search (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) for the nested RT-PCR amplicons showed that the sequences obtained in this study have 100% nucleotide (nt) identity with reference strains, confirming the detection of PDCoV. Of the 684 porcine faecal/intestinal samples tested in our PDCoV prevalence survey, 130 (19.03%) were PDCoV positive; 66 of 684 (9.66%) samples that were negative for TGEV, PEDV, and PRV were confirmed as PDCoV monoinfections (Table 1). PDCoV/ PEDV co-infections were most common (6.30%); 43 of 130 PDCoVdetected samples were found to be positive for PEDV. PDCoV/PRV co-infections were also detected (2.78%); PRV was identified in 19 of 130 PDCoV-positive samples. Two of the 130 PDCoV-positive samples were confirmed as a multiple-infection case with both PEDV and PRV (PDCoV/PEDV/PRV). None of the PDCoV-positive samples were positive for TGEV. 3.2 | Complete genomic characterizations of Korean PDCoV strains The full-length genome sequences of KOR/KNU16-07/2016 and KOR/KNU16-11/2016, representative epidemic strains from an intestinal sample collected in 2016, were determined to investigate their molecular characteristics. The entire genomic sequence of KNU16-07 is 25,422 nt in length, excluding the 3 0 poly(A) tail and has a typical PDCoV organization consisting of a 539-nt 5 0 UTR, a 18,803-nt replicase gene (nt 540-11,414 for 1a and nt 11,414-19,342 for 1b), a 3,483-nt S gene (nt 19,324-22,806), a 252-nt E gene (nt 22,800-23,051), a 654-nt M gene (nt 23,044-23,697), a 285-nt NS6 (nt 23,697-23,981), a 1,029-nt N gene (nt 24,002-25,030), a 603-nt NS7 gene (nt 24,096-24,698) and a 392-nt 3 0 UTR.

Of which, all Korean PDCoV strains identified in 2014 (KNU14-04) and in 2016 (KNU16-07 and KNU16-11) were grouped within the US PDCoV clade; however, they were situated in different branches (Figure 1b). Furthermore, a subsequent phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the fulllength S gene showed the same grouping structure as the complete genome-based tree (Figure 1c). Similarly, the KNU16 strains still belonged to the US clade but were located on a separate branch with the Korean prototype strain KNU14-04 and the other isolates (SL2 and SL5) reported in 2015. Altogether, the phylogenetic data suggest that the current strains detected in 2016 differ from the first emergent virus in South Korea.F I G U R E 1 Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome sequences of four coronavirus genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus) (a) and the nucleotide sequences of the complete genomes (b) and the S genes (c) of PDCoV strains. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalX program, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the aligned nucleotide sequences using the neighbour-joining method. Numbers at each branch represent bootstrap values greater than 50% of 1000 replicates. Names of the strains, countries, years of isolation, GenBank accession numbers and clades proposed in this study are shown. The porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) isolates identified in this study are indicated by solid circles. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per siteThe family Coronaviridae is included in the order Nidovirales along with the families Arteriviridae, Roniviridae and Mesoniviridae, infecting a broad range of species including humans, other mammals, rodents",

To provide insight into the epidemiological status of PDCoV in South Korea, it is necessary to develop assays for the detection of this newly emerged enteric virus. In this study, therefore, a nested RT-PCR method for PDCoV detection was established and utilized for a prevalence survey of PDCoV-associated diarrhoeic diseases.The high prevalence of PDCoV infections in diarrhoeal samples from pigs was confirmed in South Korea, which is similar to the results of two independent studies from the US and China(Marthaler, Raymond, et al., 2014;Song et al., 2015). RT-PCR screening of pig diarrhoeal samples collected from January 2014 to December 2016 revealed the presence of PDCoV monoinfection (9.66%) as well as co-infection with PDCoV/PEDV (6.30%) and PDCoV/PRV (2.78%). Like China, PDCoV/PEDV co-infection was the most common type of co-infection detected in South Korea, rather than",

Intriguingly, the recently identified Korean PDCoV strains contained a unique S INDEL signature at the N-terminus and C-terminus of S, respectively, and several amino acid substitutions have emerged at the external and cytosolic internal domains of the S protein. Moreover, the KNU16 strains were found to be phylogenetically different from other Korean strains, implying that potential adaptation to the natural host may be ongoing.In summary, a nested RT-PCR assay was designed and applied for the detection of PDCoV in diarrhoeic samples from pigs. As PCR development is not the objective of this study, and PCR is notevaluated, it is not suggested be stated as a stand-alone point in conclusion. A PCR-based survey indicated that PDCoV monoinfection and co-infection with PEDV or PRV were almost equally present in diarrhoeal pigs from South Korea. However, the detection rate of PDCoV in South Korea was lower than that reported in the US and China. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the Korean isolates have a close evolutionary relationship with US strains and that the virus continues to evolve and adapt to its host in the field.
