PDB summary database and multiple alignments were employed for validation of the results. Based on the mutations observed within active site region, homology derived model was constructed using swiss-pdb viewer. The residue variation observed was with respect to Tyr347 in H5N1 versus Asn344 in H1N1 neuraminidase sequence, which resulted in geometrical modification of ligand binding domain.",

The most common symptoms of the disease are chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness and general discomfort. Typically, influenza is transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus. Influenza can also be transmitted by bird droppings, saliva, nasal secretions, faeces and blood. An avian strain named H5N1 raised the concern of a new influenza pandemic, after it emerged in Asia in the 1990s. In April 2009 a novel flu strain evolved that combined genes from human, pig, and bird flu, ",
