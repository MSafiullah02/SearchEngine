            "text": "Calf diarrhoea is one of a small number of instances in which a clinical sign is universally considered, classified, or referred to as a disease. The problem with classifying calf diarrhoea as a disease is the subsequent inclination of the vet or farmer towards a pathogen\u2010oriented clinical approach. By considering diarrhoea as an indicator of altered gastrointestinal function, the clinician is more likely to adopt a systematic approach to diagnostics, therapeutics and prophylaxis, and is more apt to recognize the contribution of non\u2010infectious factors to the clinical problem. This is not to say that enteric pathogens are irrelevant in neonatal gastrointestinal disease. In the US, neonatal enteric disease has been associated with approximately 50% of the mortality observed in preweaned dairy heifer calves (Barrington et al., 2002), and enteric pathogens have been implicated in the death of 25% of the annual calf crop (Barrington et al., 2002). It is clear from epidemiological studies that the risk of neonatal enteric disease is not restricted to any one particular husbandry system or to a specific environment. This means that a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to farms with neonatal enteric disease is unlikely to be successful. The aim of this paper is to furnish the shrewd clinician with an appreciation of the enteric disease causality web along with an awareness of gastrointestinal pathophysiology. In combination, these broad concepts can be used to structure a systematic approach to the investigation and management of any bovine neonatal enteric disease outbreak.",

Remember, when examining groups, the individual animal can be considered a sentinel for events occurring at a population level. The objective of this activity is to identify the spectrum of disease present in the population. This information will be used in combination with the key determinants as evidence of causality. This step involves constructing a graphic representation of the clinical disease across the farm enterprise and, as discussed in a previous paper (Potter & Aldridge, 2010), is best achieved using a composite scoring system. The excellent calf respiratory health scoring system from the University of Wisconsin can serve as a template that can be modified to include the parameters identified as important in the disease characterization step. For instance, in neonatal gastroenteric disease it would be useful to include faecal scoring, umbilical examination and hydration in the scheme.",

The key inquiry in designing preventative programs is the identity of the controllable hazards contributing to the disease in that specific population of interest. One of the most common novice errors in preventative medicine is the temptation to coerce farmers into a husbandry system based on our general knowledge of disease epidemiology. An expert clinician is able to identify and weight the hazards contributing to specific risk and use this to design a programme to minimize those factors with the greatest impact and to achieve maximum health and economic benefit.",

For instance, if mucosal health is not an issue, then changing determinants that affect mucosal health is unlikely to provide much benefit. Examples of indicators that could help identify and differentiate between impaired mucosal health and immunity and disruption of biosecurity and biocontainment are shown in Table 2. Since most recognized pathogens are endemic on the great majority of farms (e.g. coronavirus in adult cow faeces), biocontainment is the more appropriate risk term. In some instances it may not be possible to differentiate MHI or biosecurity disturbances from one another, and on occasion one may mimic the other. For example, in some instances of poor hygiene the pathogen load becomes so large as to overwhelm even high levels of acquired colostral immunity. In these instances, the disease pattern can resemble that of reduced mucosal immunity when in fact mucosal immunity is adequate.",

Factors affecting the calf consist mainly of hazards that impact MHI, such as maternal nutrition during pregnancy, the acquisition of maternal immunity through colostrums and nutritional management. Failure of passive transfer (FPT) is usually associated with low immunoglobulin concentration in dairy calves and late ingestion in beef calves (Barrington et al., 2002). Nutritional practices such as the quality and composition and quality of milk replacer and feeding practices that effect ruminal development are also important in mucosal health. Risk factors impinging on contribution of the pathogen include virulence factors, pathogen load and the presence of other microbes. Pathogen load can be affected both qualitatively and quantitatively by the source of origin (e.g. markets) and by on farm practices such as injudicious antimicrobial administration. The physical environment of the calf can also present certain hazards, but these invariably provoke effect through the host or pathogen. For instance ventilation and humidity impact pathogen load while environmental temperature and handling strategies influence immunity. The major key determinants in neonatal gastroenteric disease are summarized in Fig. 1.",

This is achieved by demonstrating a relationship between the key determinants and the pattern of disease. For example, if environmental hygiene is an essential risk factor then the occurrence of clinical cases will be higher where hygiene is measurably worse. Similarly, if colostral immunity is an important predisposing factor then the calves with clinical signs should have low serum immunoglobulin levels. It is important not to overlook the importance of this step of the investigation. If you cannot substantiate causality, your intervention measures will be speculative and therefore at risk of failing. As we all know, failed intervention measures can be a substantial waste of financial and labour resources, and a source of discouragement to both the farmer and the vet.",
