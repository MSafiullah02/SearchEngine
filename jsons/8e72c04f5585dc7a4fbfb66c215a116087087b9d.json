            "text": "Many systems in nature and the synthetic world involve ordered arrangements of units on two-dimensional surfaces. We review here the fundamental role payed by both the topology of the underlying surface and its Gaussian curvature. Topology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground state but curvature-driven energetics controls the detailed structured of ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of structures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at zero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain boundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical crystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal crystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not depend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the first place. These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental soft and hard matter systems that lead to curved ordered structures such as colloidal particles self-assembling on droplets of one liquid in a second liquid. The defects themselves may be functionalized to create ligands with directional bonding. Thus nano to meso scale superatoms may be designed with specific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel bulk materials. Parameters such as particle number, geometrical aspect ratios and anisotropy of elastic moduli permit the tuning of the precise architecture of the superatoms and associated supermolecules. Thus the field has tremendous potential from both a fundamental and materials science/supramolecular chemistry viewpoint.",

Since then the physics community has explored the power of geometry not only to describe, but also to explain structures and their properties. In the past 20 years soft condensed matter physics has provided many examples of how the geometry of matter is not a quiescent background for some microscopic degrees of freedom, but instead plays a major role in determining structural and mechanical properties and designing the phase diagram of materials such as colloids, liquid crystals, membranes, glasses and carbon nanostructure.",

In a series of classic papers they suggested that several properties of liquids have their geometric counterpart in randomly packed arrays of spheres. The difference in density between the solid and the liquid phase of a simple monoatomic substance, for instance, is approximately the same between periodically and randomly packed hard spheres (roughly 15% \u2212 16%). Also the radial distribution function of randomly packed spheres corresponds well with that determined by X-ray and neutron diffraction for rare-gas liquids. After Bernal, a significant amount of work has been done on random close packing and, even though the legitimacy of the notion of random close packing itself has been questioned frequently in recent years [7] , it is now established that many features of the liquid state have in fact a purely geometrical nature.",

The lack of crystallization in covalent glasses is also rooted in the geometrical frustration associated with the constant coordination number of their constituents. Tetravalent monoatomic materials, for instance, cannot form a constant angle between bonds incident at the same atom and organize in a regular network at the same time. In multiatomic glass-forming materials the situation is more involved and the route to the formation of amorphous structures is related to the fact that crystallization would require complex activated phenomena and too large a decrease in entropy.",

This idea was inspired by the observation that whereas regular tetrahedra do not fill three-dimensional Euclidean space, they do regularly tile the three-dimensional sphere S 3 (the manifold described by the equation 4 i=1 x 4 i = R 2 in R 4 ) on which they build a regular polytope (Schl\u00e4fli symbol {3, 3, 5}) with 120 vertices of coordination number 12. This idea, later developed by several others (see Sadoc and Mosseri [15] , Steinhardt et al.

After the seminal work of Nelson and Peliti [20] on shape fluctuations in membranes with crystalline and hexatic order, much work has been done elucidating the intimate relation between in-plane order and the geometry of the underlying substrate with many striking results and even more open questions. The fundamental role of topological defects in two-dimensional systems, first elucidated in a series of pioneering papers by Berezinskii [21] , Kosterlitz and Thouless [22, 23, 24] , is enhanced in the presence of Gaussian curvature in the underlying medium, and leads to structures in the ground state that would normally be highly suppressed in flat systems. The goal of this article is to review the most recent developments in the study of the ground state properties of two-dimensional order on curved media; that is the structure and the mechanics of ordered phases on two-dimensional substrates equipped with non-zero Gaussian curvature, in a regime where thermal fluctuations are negligible in comparison with other energy scales in the system. While focusing on ground states we note that finite temperature physics on curved spaces is a rich source of open problems.",

            "text": "Amphiphilic membranes are thin sheets (50 \u2212 100\u00c5) of amphiphilic molecules immersed in a fluid and organized in the form of a bilayer (see Fig. 2 ). The most common constituents of biological membranes are phospholipids consisting of a polar head group and a hydrophobic tail made up of two fatty acyl chains (see Fig.  1 ). Tails have typical length 14 \u2212 20 carbon atoms and regulate the thickness and the stability of the bilayer. The polar head group contains one or more phosphate groups -POOH-O-R. Most phospholipid head groups belong to the phosphoglycerides, which contain glycerol joining the head and the tail. Examples of phosphoglycerides include phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS). These are distinguished by the residue R carried by the phosphate group (choline: R=-CH 2 -CH 2 -N + -(CH 3 ) 3 and ethanolamine: R=-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 ). The fatty acyl chain in biomembranes usually contains an even number of carbon atoms. They may be saturated (neighboring C atoms are all connected by single bonds) or unsaturated (some neighboring C atoms are connected by double bonds). At low temperature pure phospholipids crystallize and form a bilayer with all the tails in the trans configuration and the heads parallel to the bilayer surface and firmly linked into a lattice (mostly by hydrogen bonds). At higher temperature the order is disrupted and the bilayer becomes fluid. In solution lipid bilayers can be found in a number of phases with differing degrees of order among the hydrocarbon chains. For phospholipids in the PC family these phases are usually called L \u03b1 , L \u03b2 and P \u03b2 . In the L \u03b1 phase, the tails are liquid and disordered. L \u03b2 is a gel-like phase in which hydrocarbon tails are ordered and diffusion is severely reduced. The L \u03b2 \u2192 L \u03b1 transition is usually referred to as main transition. The main transition temperature T m increases with the length of the molecules due to a stronger Van der Waals attraction between adjacent molecules. The degree of unsaturation of the hydrocarbon tails also affects T m . An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the regular periodic structure and thus lowering the transition temperature. For bilayers in the PC family, T m ranges form \u221260 to 80 \u2022 C , depending on the tail length and the number of double bonds. The order of the hydrocarbon chains also implies a larger thickness of the bilayer. The two lamellar phases can be separated by an intermediate \"rippled\" phase P \u03b2 in which the bilayer exhibits an undulated structure and almost solidlike diffusion properties. Hydrocarbon chains can also appear tilted with respect to the bilayer plane. Tilted phases are generally denoted as L \u03b2 and P \u03b2 . There are in fact several L \u03b2 phases characterized by differing amounts of tilt and in-plane orientational order [25] .",

Their formation occurs more readily for single-chain amphiphiles (e.g. monoglycerids) and is favored by the presence of large head groups. At higher amphiphile concentrations spherical micelles are replaced by non-spherical ones and eventually by cylindrical rods. Spherical and cylindrical micelles can themselves organize in higher order structures such as cubic lattices or hexagonally packed rod piles.

Because of their controllable size, elasticity and permeability, colloidosomes have been recognized to form a promising class of \"soft devices\" for the encapsulation and delivery of active ingredients with a variety of potential applications for the development of novel drug and vaccine delivery vehicles and for the slow release of cosmetic and food supplements. Their major advantage relies on the fact that the permeability of the shell depends mainly on the size of the gaps between neighboring colloidal particles which can be tuned by controlling their size, interactions and degree of fusion. Velev et al. [28, 29, 30] were the first to report a method for the preparation of colloidosomes by templating octanolin-water emulsions stabilized by latex particles and subsequently removing the octanol core by dissolution in ethanol. Structures of similar architecture have been obtained by templating water-in-oil emulsions [31, 32] . Multilayer shells consisting of alternating positive and negative polyelectrolytes and/or nanoparticles have also been prepared by using layer-by-layer assembly techniques, with the final hollow shells being obtained by removal of the central, sacrificial colloidal particles [33, 34] . Loxley and Vincent [35] developed a new way of preparing polymeric capsules with liquid cores based on a phase separation of the polymer within the templated emulsion. The colloidosomes produced by Dinsmore et al. [27] were obtained by the assembly of latex particles into shells around water-in-oil emulsion drops, followed by thermal fusion of the particles in the shell and centrifugal transfer into water Figure 3 .

The particles dispersed in the fluid spontaneously adsorb on the interface provided the surface energy between the fluid on the inside and the outside of the droplet (\u03c3 i,o ) is larger than the difference of those between the particles and the internal fluid (\u03c3 p,i ) and the particles and the external fluid (\u03c3 p,o ). Thus \u03c3 i,o > |\u03c3 p,i \u2212 \u03c3 p,o |. A similar mechanism is used in Pickering emulsions, which are stabilized by surface adsorption of colloidal particles. Once adsorbed at the interface, interacting particles distribute evenly, assuring a full and uniform coverage of the droplet. The interactions depend on the type of colloidal particles used as well as the liquids. Coated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or polystyrene spheres, for instance, acquire a permanent electric dipole moment at the interface between the two fluids, probably because of the dissociation of charges on the hydrated surface similar to what happens at a water-air interface [36] . The resultant dipolar interaction stabilizes the particles and allows full coverage of the droplet.",

Several techniques are available to achieve this. By sintering polystyrene particles at a temperature slightly above the glass transition (T g \u2248 100 \u2022 C ), it is possible to achieve a partial fusion of neighboring particles at the contact points. This process also allows one to control precisely the size of the gaps between particles and therefore the permeability of the colloidosome. Another method consists of binding the particles with a polyelectrolyte of opposite charge which can bridge neighboring particles and immobilize them at the interface. Particle locking clearly enhances the toughness of the colloidal shell and increases its rupture stress. For sintered polystyrene particles the latter can be tuned within the range 1 \u2212 100 MPa. Colloidosomes locked with polyelectrolytes are even more deformable and can withstand strains of order 50 % before rupturing.",

Because of the large difference in dielectric constants, ions from the oil strongly partition into the water phase [38] . When nearly 100% PMMA particles are dispersed into the oil phase they form a Wigner crystal and a monolayer near the interface separated by a zone depleted of particles. These last two features are due the ion partitioning that provides the water phase with mobile charges. The net charge of water can be controlled through the pH, shifting the hydrolysis and ion partitioning equilibria. An electrically neutral water droplet acts as a conductor and attracts PMMA particles at the interface through an image charge mechanism. As a result the particles are barely wet by the water phase and organize in a perfect monolayer at (and not across) the interface.",

Spherical viruses typically posses icosahedral symmetry with twelve pentamers located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The number of hexamers that complete the capsids is given by 10(T \u2212 1), where T , the triangulation number, takes values from a sequence of \"magic numbers\" (i.e. T = 1, 3, 4, 7 . . .) associated with the lattice structure of the capsid, as brilliantly explained by Caspar and Klug (CK) in a seminal 1962 [39] (the CK construction of icosahedral lattices will be reviewed in Sec. 3). The diameters of spherical viruses span the range from 10 to 100 nm. While small capsids are almost perfectly spherical, large viruses, such as the bacteriophage HK97 or the phycodnavirus, typical exhibit a faceted geometry with nearly flat portions separated by ridges and sharp corners corresponding to the twelve pentamers. This morphological difference was explained by Lidmar et al [40] as a buckling transition resulting from a balance between the stretching energy associated with the pentamers in capsomer lattices and the bending elasticity of the viral capsid.",

The latter, in particular, were suggested to serve as possible nucleation centers for the formation of dislocations in the original ideal graphene network and constitute the onset of possible plastic deformations [54] . Electronic transport is affected by the presence of defects by lowering the conductivity through the defective region of the tube. Defect formation in armchair-type tubes (which can conduct electricity) can cause the region surrounding that defect to become semiconducting. Furthermore, single monoatomic vacancies induce magnetic properties. Phonon scattering by defective regions heavily affects the thermal properties of carbon nanotubes and leads to an overall reduction of the thermal conductivity. Phonon transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high frequency optical phonons. Larger scale defects, however, such as Stone Wales defects, cause phonon scattering over a wide range of frequencies, leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity [55] . On the other hand, defective regions appear to be natural places for chemical functionalization. Numerical simulations have shown how the presence of Stone-Wales defects considerably enhances the adsorption of carboxyl groups (COOH) which can then bind to molecules with amide and ester bonds [56] .",

The expression was used for the first time by Toulouse in 1977 [58] to describe certain particular magnetic systems with nearest-neighbours interactions which cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. A textbook example of frustration in magnetic models is represented by a system of Ising spins on a triangular lattice with antiferromagnetic bonds: while a perfect antiferromagnetic alignment would minimize all terms in the Ising Hamiltonian, such an alignment is not allowed by the topology of the underlying lattice so that for any triangular plaquette there is always at least one unsatisfied bond (see Fig. 6 ). This concept can be extended naturally to any system where interactions impose a local order, but the most favoured local configuration is geometrically incompatible with the structure of the embedding space.",

This approach has the advantage of far fewer degrees of freedom than a direct treatment of the microscopic interactions and allows one to explore the origin of the emergent symmetry observed in non-Euclidean ordered structures as a result of the interplay between defects and geometry. This interplay is one of the fundamental hallmarks of order on two-dimensional manifolds and leads to universal features observed in systems as different as viral capsids and carbon macromolecules.

As noted, this framework is valid for both nematic liquid crystals in the one elastic constant approximation and superfluids. An important difference between these two systems lies in the choice of the boundary condition for the field \u03b8. Nematogens are typically forced to be normal to boundary of the substrate and this implies a constraint for \u03b8, while there is no such constraint for 4 He films since the wave function is defined in a different space from that to which the superfluid is confined. This difference is crucial on a curved substrate (see Ref. [64] for a detailed review of this topic). Eq. (29) represents the elastic energy associated with the distortion introduced by defects in the far field, where the elastic variables change slowly in space. This expression breaks down in the neighborhood (or core) of a defect, where the order parameter is destroyed and the actual energetic contribution depends on microscopic details. In order to describe a defective system at any length scale, Eq. (29) must be corrected by adding a core energy F c representing the energetic contribution within the core of a defect, where standard elasticity breaks down. A detailed calculation of the core energy requires some microscopic model and is usually quite complicated. Nonetheless its order of magnitude can be estimated by writing:",

            "text": "The elasticity of topological defects on curved substrates equipped with local orientational order was first considered by Nelson and Peliti in the context of hexatic membranes [20] . It is now standard knowledge in the statistical mechanics of membranes that long range forces appearing as a consequence of local orientational order crucially affect the behavior of membranes at finite temperature. The stiffness associated with orientational correlations leads to an enhancement of the bending rigidity that counteracts the thermal softening that occurs in fluid membranes. Furthermore, for planar membranes, the stabilizing effect induced by the orientational stiffness opposes the entropy-driven tendency to crumple, causing a transition between a flat and crumpled phase at T > 0. In this review we focus on the ground state properties of ordered structures on curved surfaces and we refer the reader to the literature for a discussion of finite temperature physics [19] . In this section we will show how an underlying non-zero Gaussian curvature couples with the defects by screening their topological charge. As a result, topological defects, whose existence would be energetically suppressed if the same system was lying on a flat substrate, instead proliferate. The universality of such a curvature screening mechanism is remarkable in the sense that it occurs in a conceptually identical fashion in both p\u2212atics and solids, although the kernel of the elastic interactions between defects differs. As a consequence of curvature screening topological defects organize themselves on a rigid surface so as to match the Gaussian curvature of the substrate. On the other hand, if the geometry of the substrate is allowed to change (for instance by lowering the bending rigidity) the system eventually enters a regime where the substrate itself changes shape in order to accommodate some preferential in-plane order. The latter is the fundamental mechanism behind the buckling of crystalline membranes [69] and is believed to be the origin of the polyhedral geometry of large spherical viruses such as bacteriophages [70] .",

Eq (54) is identical to the Coulomb energy of a multi-component plasma of charge density \u03b7 in a background of charge density \u2212K. Like particles in a plasma, we can expect defects to screen each other's charge, thus forming clusters of zero net charge, and matching the charge distribution of the surrounding background. This implies that disclinations will be attracted to regions of like-sign Gaussian curvature. Crystalline surfaces (i.e. non-Euclidean crystals) differ from manifolds equipped with a p\u2212atic director field because bonds, whose local orientation is encoded in the field \u03b8 in p\u2212atics, can now be compressed and sheared to relieve part of the elastic stress due to the geometrical frustration provided by the embedding manifold. A first attempt at describing the elasticity of defects on a two-dimensional curved crystal was made by Dodgson [71] , who studied the ground state of the Abrikosov fulx lattice in a model thin-film superconductor on a sphere (subject to a field radiating from a magnetic monopole at the center) and found evidence for twelve 5\u2212fold disclinations at the vertices of an icosahedron in a otherwise 6\u2212fold coordinated environment (see Sec. 3 for a detailed review of spherical crystals). Later, Dodgson and Moore [72] proposed adding dislocations to the ground state of a sufficiently large spherical vortex crystal to screen out the strain introduced by the twelve, topologically required, disclinations. A general framework to describe the elasticity of defects in non-Euclidean crystals was proposed by Bowick, Nelson and Travesset (BNT) in 2000 [73] . The BNT model, obtained from the covariantization of the elastic energy (49) , relies on the following expression for the elastic energy of a collection of disclinations in a triangular lattice of underlying Gaussian curvature K:",

            "text": "To understand the structure of spherical crystals, we must find the ground state of M particles distributed on a surface \u03a3 and interacting with, say, pairwise repulsive potentials. For simplicity consider power law potentials V (r) = e 2 /r \u03b3 , where e is a generalized electric charge. The energy of M particles at positions r( ), with = (l 1 , l 2 ) \u2208 Z\u2297Z, becomes 2E 0 = = e 2 /|r( )\u2212r( )| \u03b3 . This covers most of the interesting physical systems. The case \u03b3 = 1 corresponds to the pure 3D Coulomb potential, appropriate for charged colloids. This is known as the Thomson problem in the physics and mathematics literature and has been widely studied for over 100 years [78, 79, 80] . The case \u03b3 = 3 corresponds to a dipole interaction, appropriate for neutral colloids at the interface between two liquids. The different dielectric constants of the two liquids leads to an asymmetric distribution of charge on the colloids and a net dipole moment. The case \u03b3 = 12 is the repulsive part of the Lennard-Jones potential and is the important piece of the interaction for driving crystallization. Finally the limit \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e is an extreme short range interaction that selects the pair of particles with the minimum distance. The equivalent packing of spherical caps was introduced in 1930 by the biologist Tammes [81] and connects the present problem to the rich physics and mathematics of packing [82, 83] . The packing of particles on surfaces of nontrivial topology is relevant to a broad range of physical, chemical and biological systems in addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest. An almost literal realization of the Thomson problem is provided by multi-electron bubbles [84, 85] . Electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium have long been used to investigate two dimensional melting [86, 87] . Multi-electron bubbles result when a large number of electrons (10 5 \u221210 7 ) at the helium interface subduct in response to an increase in the anode potential and coat the inside wall of a helium vapor sphere of radius 10\u2212100\u00b5m. Typical electron spacings, both at the interface and on the sphere, are of order 2000\u00c5, so the physics is entirely classical, in contrast to the quantum problem of electron shells which originally motivated J.J. Thomson [78] . Information about electron configurations on these bubbles can, in principle, be inferred from studying capillary wave excitations [88, 89] . Similar electron configurations should arise on the surface of liquid metal drops confined in Paul traps [90] .",

The energy of discrete particle arrays described by Eq. (61) can be evaluated by starting with some configuration close to an (n, m) one and relaxing it to find a minimum. It is found that the (n, m) configurations are always local minima. Whether these icosahedral configurations are global minima as well will be analyzed later. Results for the energy E(M ) are shown in the inset to Fig. 11 . From Fig. 11 it is clear that energies grow very fast for increasing volume. More interestingly, the (n, 0) and (n, n) configurations show a growing difference in energy for increasing volume size, implying that the energy of icosahedral configurations does not tend to a universal value for large numbers of particles but rather remains sensitive to the (n, m) configuration, a result also noted by other authors [105] . Further insight comes from investigating the distribution of energy. Plots of the local electrostatic energy, the electrostatic energy at point x on the sphere, as defined in Eq. (61) are shown in Fig. 12 [109] . From Fig. 12 it should be noted that the triangles obtained by the Voronoi-Delaunay construction, after minimization of the potential Eq. (61), are very close to equilateral. The distribution of the local energies for the (n, 0) and (n, n) configurations are very different. The (n, 0) configuration shows maximum energies along the paths joining the defects. The (n, n) configuration, on the other hand, has its maximum energies along the directions defined by the triangles formed by three nearest neighbor disclinations. The size of these regions of differing electrostatic energy turns out to scale with system size, making it very plausible that there might be small differences in the energy per particle for (n, 0) and (n, n) configurations in the limit n \u2192 \u221e.",

It is natural to introduce vacancies and interstitials in an attempt to understand spherical particle packings that deviate from the sequence of \"magic numbers\" N nm = 10(n 2 + nm + m 2 ) + 2. It is tempting to ignore the instability to grain boundary scars for large N nm and regard the commensurate (n, m) lattice as an interesting metastable state. It would then be natural to introduce vacancies and interstitials to describe candidate ground state packings for N nm \u00b1 t particles, where t = 1, 2, ... and much less than the distance to the next magic number. There is, however, another surprise in store: in contrast to flat space, where vacancy and interstitial defects are stable and well defined, one finds that interstitials and vacancies are typically ripped apart into dislocation fragments by the strain fields of nearby 5-fold disclinations. The dislocations then combine with some of the excess 5's to form defect clusters such 5-7-5. Thus, vacancies and interstitials lose their integrity via fragmentation in spherical crystals, and mediate formation of small grain boundary scars. Figure 19 . (Color online) Initial icosahedral configuration of an (8,3) spherical crystal lattice with 12 disclination defects. This lattice is chiral, and is arranged such that 8 steps along a Bragg row, followed by 3 steps to the right along a Bragg row at a 120 \u2022 angle, connect neighboring 5-fold disclinations. Distinct initial locations for interstitials are shown as triangular plaquettes labeled by characters and numbers.",

            "text": "The presence of excess dislocation defects in the ground state of spherical crystals is dramatically illustrated by the following numerical experiment: we start with a regular icosadeltahedral tessellation of the sphere -say an (8, 3) , corresponding to N 83 = 972 (Fig. 19 ). This may be done with the applet located at [109] using the Construct (m, n) algorithm. Although the true ground state for 972 particles on the sphere with most pair potentials has additional dislocation defects (i.e. tightly bound pairs of 5-and 7-coordinated particles) arrayed in grain boundary scars [73] , the regular icosadeltahedral lattice is a local minimum from which it is difficult to escape without the addition of thermal noise. In fact it is a major challenge to find fast and reliable algorithms to locate the true ground state (global minimum) in this problem with its complex energy landscape. Now add a single particle to the lattice at the center of mass of a spherical triangle whose vertices are 3 nearest-neighbor 5-fold disclinations (using commands shift + click). The self-interstitial so formed is then relaxed by a standard relaxation algorithm, with sufficient thermal noise to allow dislocation glide over the Peierls potential [93] . One immediately finds that an interstitial is structurally unstable. In a few time steps it morphs into a complex of dislocations with zero net Burgers vector. The most common structure observed is a set of three dislocations, with Burgers vectors perpendicular to a line joining each 5-7 pair, inclined at 120 \u2022 angles to each other. Eventually the interstitial complex is ripped apart entirely, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 20 (see also Fig. 21 ). Intermediate configurations and final states as the dislocations glide apart will be classified later. Most often three separate dislocations are formed which each glide toward a 5-fold disclination. The end result is the formation of a \"mini-scar\" (a 5 \u2212 7 \u2212 5 grain boundary) at each of the vertex 5s. Subsequent removal of a particle to restore the particle number to the original 972 and relaxing still leaves scars with total energy lower than the starting configuration with 12 isolated 5's. This observation confirms that scars are definitely lower energy states and not simply artifacts of the relaxation algorithm.",

The spherical crystal is distorted by the additional particle -the local configuration adopted by the interstitial changes as the crystal relaxes toward a lower energy state. As in the case of planar lattices, one also finds here that various interstitial defect configurations appear, such as the twofold symmetric interstitial I 2 , the threefold symmetric interstitial I 3 , and the fourfold symmetric interstitial I 4 (see Figs. 21, 22, and 23).

As we shall see, the instability is caused by interactions with the inevitable disclinations associated with the nonzero Gaussian curvature of the sphere. A representative evolution of an interstitial inserted at the center of three neighboring disclinations in an (8, 3) icosadeltahedron is shown in Fig. 21 . After some local relaxation the interstitial configuration denoted I 3 is formed, as shown in Fig. 21 (a) . We also show there the construction of a triangular contour surrounding the original interstitial defect. The presence of an interstitial follows because the contour encloses 7 particles instead of 6, the number appropriate to a perfect triangular lattice. During the annealed relaxation illustrated in Figs. 21(b) through (d), the dislocations which are bound together in the initial interstitial unbind into individual dislocations and subsequently glide towards nearby disclinations, eventually forming minimal 5-7-5 grain boundary scars. If one thinks of the initial dislocations as internal degrees of freedom within the interstitial, one could say that one-third of an interstitial is present in each mini-scar in the final state and thus that the interstitial demonstrates 1/3 fractionalization. For other initial conditions the fractionation is into two dislocations, each representing 1/2 of the original interstitial. The instability of interstitial defects in curved crystals may be studied via continuum elasticity theory by calculating the interaction energies between defects at each stage of the relaxation process of Fig. 21 [119] . We note that the triangular plaquette around the initial defect has been deformed such that it conforms as closely as possible to the regular triangular lattice during the relaxation process. Its deformation reveals the passage of the escaping dislocations.",

This disclination absorbs the dislocation but hops over one lattice spacing to accommodate the curved space Burgers vector. The other two dislocations end up bound in the form of mini-scars.

Nematic spheres might be made by coating a droplet with gemini lipids, ABA triblock copolymers or nanorods. Microfluidic techniques for creating a thin spherical shell of liquid crystal in a double emulsion have been explored in [129, 130] . Although the tetrahedral array of four type-1/2 nematic disclinations might be unstable to Boojum formation (type-1 defects) for spheres immersed in a nematic bulk fluid [131] , Huber and Stark [132] have shown that nematic wetting for spheres immersed in an isotropic fluid is a promising alternative route to a spherical nematic. An important motivation for exploring nematic order on spherical topologies is the search for superatoms of low valency. We have seen that spherical crystals have 12 distinguished regions, each region being marked by the presence of either an isolated 5-disclination or an extended defect array like a scar. By functionalizing these regions one could hope to engineer 12-valent supermolecules. In particular one might be able to take advantage of the unusual presence of 5-7 pairs (dislocations) in scars to convert scars to sticky zones of the spherical superatom. Twelve is very likely too high a coordination number, however, to produce viable molecules or bulk materials. How can we change the coordination number of spherical superatoms? The solution lies in changing the local order on the sphere. An ordered state on the sphere with p-fold symmetry will have 2p net topological defects by Eq. (3). The crystalline case discussed so far corresponds to p = 6. Vector-like order on the sphere corresponds to p = 1 and the defects correspond to index-one vorticesone can also visualize the source and sink of fluid flow on a sphere [see Fig. 24(a) ] or imagine the base and crown bald spots of hair combed on a sphere. Thus a 2-sphere decorated with magnetic (or any other vector) field lines is a candidate for a valence-2 superatom. Consider now nematic order: p = 2. In this case the vortex configurations above each break up into 2 type-1/2 nematic disclinations, leading to a total of 4 defects located at the corners of a tetrahedron (in the one Frank constant approximation) [59] (see Fig. 24(b) ). This raises the possibility of making tetravalent superatoms with sp 3 type bonding [128] .",

            "text": "Although the elementary type-1/2 disclinations favor a tetrahedral geometry if splay and bend deformations are degenerate in energy this changes when elastic anisotropy is present. In the limit of pure splay or pure bend the energy of a +1 defect becomes degenerate with two 1/2 defects. Thus two +1 defects sitting at the north and south pole can be separated be cutting the sphere on a great circle joining the two defects and rotating by an arbitrary angle \u03b1. This gives rise to a set of four 1/2 disclinations lying on the same great circle and therefore coplanar in the embedding space [134] . Thus the tetrahedral configuration crosses over to a great-circle configuration as one increases the anisotropy of the elastic constants. This explicitly demonstrates that defect positions can be controlled by varying the elastic anisotropy. Thus the structure of directional bonding for the associated supermolecules is controllable. Under specific experimental conditions amphiphilic molecules in solution, such as lipids or amphiphilic block copolymers, self-assemble in a spectacular variety of shapes including spherical and cylindrical micelles, vesicles and lamellae, together with more complex geometries such as uni-and multilamellar vesicles, onion vesicles, toroidal and cage-shaped micelles. The exact shape and size of these structures has been observed to depend on both molecular details, such as molecular size, the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio and molecular stiffness, and collective parameters, such as the concentration or the diffusivity of the molecules. As noted previously, amphiphilic membranes can exist in different thermodynamic states depending on the degree of orientational and positional order and their precise molecular constituents. The L \u03b2 and P \u03b2 phases, which occur in lipid membranes featuring the phosphatidylcholine (PC) group, have been found, in particular, to exhibit in-plane orientational correlations extending over 200\u00c5, one order of magnitude larger than the typical spacing between PC groups [25, 135] . Because of thermal fluctuations, such membranes are typically corrugated, possessing spatially inhomogeneous Gaussian and mean curvature. Furthermore it is likely for lipid membranes to have pores providing a passage from the exterior to the interior of a vesicle. It is therefore natural to ask how variable Gaussian curvature and the presence of one or more boundaries affects the phenomenology reviewed thus far for the sphere.",

The former can be thought as a gentle deformation of a plane and thus can serve as a playground to analyze the onset of behavior not found in planar systems; the latter is possibly the simplest two-dimensional Riemannian surface having variable Gaussian curvature and boundary and provides a setting that is simple enough to carry out a full analytical treatment and analyze also large curvature regimes. Furthermore, since paraboloidal shapes naturally occur across the air/liquid interface of a fluid placed in a rotating cylindrical vessel, a direct physical realization of paraboloidal crystals can be constructed by assembling monodisperse objects on the surface of a rotating liquid. In Sec. 4.5 we review a simple experiment by Bowick et al [136] in which such a macroscopic model for a paraboloidal crystal is constructed by assembling a two-dimensional soap bubble \"raft\" on the air/liquid interface of a water-soap solution, thus extending the classic work of Bragg and Nye on planar bubble rafts.",

Its formidable power lies in the fact that the mapping that allows one to transform a generic surface into a simpler \"irreducible\" one is not an arbitrary homeomorphism but is conformal, and thus preserves part of the geometrical structure of the original manifold. In the following we will see how this feature has important consequences in the elastic theory of defects on curved surfaces. The uniformization of Riemannian surfaces is historically the first example of geometrization. In the case of manifolds of higher Hausdorff dimension, and 3-manifolds in particular, the latter program has become, following Thurston, one of the most challenging and fascinating chapters of modern geometry.

Upon increasing the aspect ratio, more dislocations appear.

At the onset of defect proliferation, inter-defect interactions are negligible compared to the interactions with the \"smeared out\" topological charge associated with the curvature of the underlying medium.

A plot of the function (136) is shown in Fig. 26 . The profile of the function F int can be undestood by regarding a dislocation as bound pair of disclinations of opposite topological charge. Each disclination interacts with a potential of the form (133) . For small r, positive (negative) disclinations are attracted (repelled) by the center of the bump. As a consequence disclinations experience a force which increases linearly with r. Thus if the positive disclination in the dipole is closer to the top, it will experience a force that is opposite and slightly less than that acting on the negative disclination that is further from the top. As a result an effective \"tidal\" force will push the dislocation downhill. For large r, however, the geometric potential saturates and the attractive force exerted on the positive disclination takes over and drags the dislocation toward the center of the bump. The minimum of the elastic energy corresponding to the equilibrium between these two competing forces is obtained for \u03bb \u2248 1.1. The origin of these forces is the Peach-Koehler force f k = kj b i \u03c3 ij acting on a dislocation of Burgers vector b i in an external stress field \u03c3 ij . In the case of a two-dimensional crystal on a substrate with preexisting Gaussian curvature, dislocations couple with the internal stress due to the curvature of the medium, with similar effects. Unbound dislocations occur in the ground state of a crystalline Gaussian bump when the aspect ratio \u03b1 exceeds a critical value. For nearly flat landscapes the energetic cost of a pair of unbound dislocations is larger than that arising from the distortion of the medium and the system is favored to be defect free. Upon increasing the aspect ratio, however, the resulting elastic strain can be partially relieved by introducing a pair of dislocations with equal and opposite Burgers vector. The transition occurs when the energy gain from placing each dislocation in the minimum of the potential energy F int outweights the total work needed to tear them apart plus the core energies 2E d .

The interaction between defects and curvature also has some remarkable stabilizing effects on defect dynamics. Dislocation dynamics consists of two distinct processes: glide and climb. Glide is motion along the direction of the Burgers vector. It requires only local rearrangement of atoms and thus has a very low activation energy, making it dominant at low temperatures. Climb consists of motion in the direction perpendicular to the Burgers vector. It requires diffusion of vacancies and interstitials and is usually suppressed therefore relative to glide. As a consequence of the underlying curvature, however, a gliding dislocation experiences a \"recalling\" force f recall \u2248 k d |y|, where y is the transverse displacement and k d is a position-dependent effective spring constant.

As a result, interstitials tend to climb to the top of the bump while vacancies are pushed into the flat regions. Like a disclination of positive topological charge, an interstitial is attracted to regions of positive Gaussian curvature while a vacancy is attracted to regions of negative Gaussian curvature. The crystalline structure arising on a Gaussian bump has been investigated numerically by Hexemer et al [141] . By means of smart Monte Carlo (SMC) simulations, the authors analyzed the ground state configuration of a system of N point-like particles (with N up to 780) interacting on a Gaussian bump of variable aspect ratio with a Yukawa potential of the form U (r) = exp(\u2212\u03bar)/r, with r the Euclidean distance between two particles in R 3 . This potential approximately describes the interaction between charged particles in solution with counter-ions, with \u03ba \u22121 being the Deybe-H\u00fcckel screening length. Starting from an initially defect-free lattice and relaxing it with order 10 5 SMC iterations, Hexemer et al observed the appearance of defects for increasing aspect ratio. Fig. 29 shows the arrangement of 780 particles for three different aspect ratios. As predicted by the elastic theory, the proliferation of defects starts with the appearance of a pair of isolated dislocations ( Figs. 29a and b) . They are sitting at \u03bb = 1.46 from the center and are rotated by 180 \u2022 , giving rise to a configuration with total Burgers vector close to zero. Upon increasing the aspect ratio, a third dislocation is observed (Fig. 29c  and d) . The three dislocations are rotated by 120 \u2022 with respect to each other. The green and blue circles in Fig. 29c and d mark the region of zero Gaussian curvature and the minimum of the geometric potential at 1.1 r 0 . As shown in the figure, for \u03b1 = 0.95 two of the three dislocation are not sitting at 1.1 r 0 as one might expect. One is deep inside the area of positive Gaussian curvature while the other is in the region of negative Gaussian curvature. Hexemer et al attributed this discrepancy to finite-size effects. Fig. 29e and f show the lowest energy state on a bump of aspect ratio \u03b1 = 1.58. In this situation dislocations appear arranged in the form of grain boundaries. This phenomenon has a simple interpretation. The total elastic energy of a collection of defects on a curved surface consists of three parts: the curvature-defect interaction discussed above, which tends to localize the defects where the geometric potential is minimal, a defect-defect interaction which is repulsive for like-sign defects and attractive for defects of opposite sign and an additional contribution due to the curvature alone. For a small number of dislocations, inter-defect interactions are negligible compared with curvature-defect interactions and dislocations tend to gather where F int is minimal. As shown from the data in Fig. 30 , however, the total number of dislocations in the bump is linearly proportional to the aspect ratio. When the total number of dislocations on the bump exceeds some threshold value the repulsive interaction takes over and dislocations start spreading. Dislocations with parallel (antiparallel) Burgers vector are organized in such a way as to maximize (minimize) their reciprocal distance while still taking advantage of the Gaussian curvature screening. The competition leads to the appearance of the Y \u2212shaped grain boundaries shown in Fig. 29 . The branching allows the dislocations to lower their potential energy by keeping a large number of dislocations close to the 1.1 r 0 circle.",

By a numerical minimization of the energy Eq. (143) one can establish that the Y b are indeed equilibrium configurations for b \u2208 [3, 5] , for some range of the parameters \u03ba and R. The cases of b = 5, 6 are particularly significant because they are characterized by an equal number of defects (N = 6) of the same topological charge (q = 1). The two configurations will be associated therefore with the same core energy F c and this introduces the possibility of a structural transition between Y 5 and Y 6 governed by the curvature ratio \u03ba and the boundary radius R. For fixed R and small values of \u03ba, the 6\u2212fold symmetric configuration Y 6 is the global minimum of the free energy Eq. (143). For \u03ba larger than some critical value \u03ba c (R), however, the Y 6 crystal becomes unstable with respect to the 5\u2212fold symmetric configuration Y 5 . A numerical calculation of the intersection point between the elastic energies of Y 5 and Y 6 for different values of \u03ba and R allow us to construct the phase diagram shown in Fig. 33 . The word \"phase\" in this context refers to the symmetry of the ground state configuration as a function of the geometrical system parameters \u03ba and R. In principle, if we keep increasing the curvature we might expect the crystal to undergo a further transition to the Y 4 phase. In this case, however, the core energy will also increase by a factor 4/3 and so this is not generally possible in the regime in which F c F el . For intermediate regimes (i.e. F c \u223c F el ), Y 5 \u2192 Y 4 and Y 4 \u2192 Y 3 transitions are also possible. The critical value of the parameters \u03ba and R, however, is not universal and will depend on the precise values of the core energy and the Young modulus.",

This leads to a three region phase diagram in which the regime of isolated disclinations is separated from the delocalized regime of scars by a novel phase in which both isolated disclinations and scars coexist in different parts of the paraboloid according to the magnitude of the Gaussian curvature. It is useful to measure the distance L c in terms of the lattice spacing a and rephrase Eq. (162) as a condition on a (or equivalently on the number of vertices V ). To do this we note that in order for the domain C L to completely screen the topological charge of the shortest scar possible (i.e. 5 \u2212 7 \u2212 5), the geodesic radius L has to be large enough to enclose the entire length of the scar.

A comparison of the lattices in the first two rows of Fig. 35 , in particular, reveals substantial agreement with the scenario summarized in Fig. 34 . For \u03ba = 0.8 and V = 200, the defects are all localized along the boundary with the exception of one length-3 scar in the bulk at distance r \u2248 0.63 from the center. For \u03ba = 1.6, the pattern of defects in the bulk is characterized by the coexistence of an isolated +1\u2212disclination at the origin and a length-5 W \u2212shaped scar displaced along a parallel one lattice spacing away from the central disclination. Apart from the evident difficulty in comparing the struc-tures of small systems with those predicted from continuum elasticity theory, this behavior is consistent with the simple picture sketched in the phase-diagram of Fig.  34 . The local 5\u2212fold symmetry at the origin of the \u03ba = 1.6 configuration, compared with 6\u2212fold symmetry for \u03ba = 0.8, suggests, as in the case of spherical crystals [94] , that the complicated structure of defect clusters appearing in large systems is the result of the instability of the simpler Y b,n configurations from which they partially inherit their overall symmetry. A more accurate numerical verification of our theory remains a challenge for the future.",

A carefully made assemblage of bubbles, floating on the surface of a soap solution and held together by capillary forces, forms an excellent two-dimensional replica of a crystalline solid, in which the regular triangular arrangement of bubbles is analogous to the close packed structure of atoms in a metal. Feynman considered this technique to be important enough that the famous Feynman lectures in physics include a reproduction of the original Bragg-Nye paper in its entirety [147] . Bubble rafts can be made easily and inexpensively, equilibrate quickly, exhibit topological defects such as disclinations, dislocations and grain boundaries, and provide vivid images of the structure of defects. Bubble raft models have been used to study two-dimensional polycrystalline and amorphous arrays [148] , nanoindentation of an initially defect-free crystal [149] , and the dynamic behavior of crystals under shear [150] . In this section we review the experimental realization of a bubble-raft model for a paraboloidal crystal done by Bowick et al [136] by assembling a single layer of millimeter-sized soap bubbles on the surface of a rotating liquid, thus extending the classic work of Bragg and Nye on planar soap bubble rafts.",

Thus the normal curvature at the origin is given by \u03ba = \u03c9 2 /g. Fig. 36 shows a computer reconstruction from Ref. [136] of two bubble rafts with \u03ba = 0.15 cm \u22121 and \u03ba = 0.32 cm 1 respectively. Soap bubbles have diameter a = 0.84(1) mm with monodispersity \u2206a/a \u2248 0.003. The images shown in Fig.  36 are taken with a CCD digital camera rotating along with a cylindrical vessel of radius R = 5 cm and Delaunay triangulated to determine the lattice topology. The degree of order of the crystalline raft can be characterized by the translational and orientational correlation functions g(r) and g 6 (r) [110] . The former gives the probability of finding a particle at distance r from a fixed particle at the origin. The function is normalized with the density of an equivalent homogeneous system in order to ensure g(r) = 1 for a system with no structure. Interactions between particles build up correlations in their position and g(r) exhibits decaying oscillations, asymptotically approaching one. For a two-dimensional solid with a triangular lattice structure the radial correlation function is expected to exhibit sharp peaks at r/a = \u221a n 2 + nm + m 2 = 1, \u221a 3, 2, 2 \u221a 3 . . ., while the amplitude of the peaks decays algebraically as r \u2212\u03b7 with \u03b7 = 1/3 (dashed line in Fig. 37 ). Within the precision of the data, the positional order of the paraboloidal crystals assembled with the bubble raft model reflects this behavior, although with more accurate measurements one might see dependence of the exponent \u03b7 on the curvature (because of the proliferation of defects with curvature).",

For a gently curved paraboloid (with \u03ba \u2248 0.15 cm \u22121 ), grain boundaries form long (possibly branched) chains running from one side to the other and passing through the center. As the curvature of the paraboloid is increased, however, this long grain boundary is observed to terminate in the center (see Fig. 36d ; a closeup version of this image is seen in Fig. 38 ). For R = 5 cm, the elastic theory of defects predicts a structural transition at \u03ba c = 0.27 cm \u22121 in the limit of large core energies. In this limit the creation of defects is strongly penalized and the lattice has the minimum number of disclinations required by the topology of the embedding surface. In a low curvature paraboloid (\u03ba < \u03ba c ) these disclinations are preferentially located along the boundary to reduce the elastic energy of the system. When the aspect ratio of the paraboloid exceeds a critical value \u03ba c (R), however, the curvature at the origin is enough to support the existence of a 5\u2212fold disclination and the system undergoes a structural transition.

When the curvature of the paraboloid exceeds a critical value, dependent on the radius of the circular boundary, the existence of a +1 disclination near the center is energetically favored.

The existence of such complex structures has become an experimental fact thanks to the enormous work in the past decade on the study of self-assembly of amphiphilic compounds such as lipids, surfactants and amphiphilic block copolymers. After the work of Eisenberg and coworkers [153, 154, 155] it became clear that block copolymers in particular afford access to a variety of complex structures spanning an unexpectedly vast range of topologies and geometries.

These polymers selfassemble in Y \u2212shaped junctions and these form the building blocks for more complex micellar structures via re-assembly. Later, Pochan et al. [157] found that almost all of the microstructures assembled from poly(acrylic acid-b-methyl acrylateb-styrene) (PAA99-PMA73-PS66) triblock copolymers are ringlike or toroidal micelles. The route to toroidal micelles in block copolymers, however, is believed to be different from that to more complex network structures suggested by Jain and Bates, since residual Y \u2212shaped aggregates are very rarely found in the sample. According to the authors of Ref. [157] , the formation of toroidal micelles has to be attributed primarly to the collapse of cylindrical micelles. On the other hand, mere end-to-end connection of cylindrical micelles doesn't appear to be the exclusive ring-forming mechanism in triblock systems since the average circumference of the self-assembled tori appears smaller than the contour length of the average cylindrical micelles. It seems to be a more complicated process, possibly involving interactions and exchange of matter between neighboring cylinders. Toroidal micelles have also been observed in recent experiments by Kim et al [158] from the self-assembly of amphiphilic dumbbell molecules based on a aromatic rod segment that is grafted by hydrophilic polyether dendrons at one end and hydrophobic branches at the other end. Molecular dumbbells dissolved in a selective solvent self-assemble in an aggregate structure due to their amphiphilic character. This process has been observed to yield coexisting spherical and openended cylindrical micelles. These structures, however, change slowly over the course of a week to toroidal micelles which thus appear more stable. The formation of ringlike structures was explained in this case as result of the coalescence of spherical micelles occurring to reduce the contact between hydrophobic segments and water molecules. An alternative pathway for the self-assembly of toroidal structures in copolymer solutions has been proposed and numerically tested by He and Schimd [159] . In this pathway, the micelles do not coalesce, but simply grow by attracting copolymers from the solution. Once a critical micelle size is exceeded, copolymers start to flipflop in such a way that the micelle core becomes itself solvent-philic (semi-vesicle state). Finally the solvent diffuses inside the core and the semi-vesicle swells into a vesicle.",

This hypothesis was tested by Evans in 1995 with the result that a toroidal topology is indeed prefered over the spherical one for wide range of geometrical and mechanical parameters in defect-free p\u2212atic tori. The role of disclinations in p\u2212atic tori was investigated systematically by Bowick, Nelson and Travesset nine years after the original work of Evans with the conclusion that, even if not required by topological constraints, unbound disclinations can be energetically convenient even in very dense systems [161] . The precise number of unbound disclinations is controlled primarly by the aspect ratio of the torus. The existence of defects in the ground state of an ordered phase on the torus is crucial for toroidal crystals where it leads to some unique structural features as well as a spectacular example of a curvature-driven transition to a disordered, liquid-like, state in the limit the aspect ratio approaches to one [162, 163] . In the remainder of this section we will review these three examples of order on embedded tori. ",

The simplest question one can ask in this context is whether a vesicle can be energetically favored to change its topology from spherical to toroidal once the total surface area, and therefore the number of constituent molecules in the vesicle, is specified. Evans addressed this problem in 1995 [160] and showed how such a transition between genera is indeed possible in fluid membranes and is even enhanced if the membrane is endowed with in-plane orientational order. Although oversimplified if compared to the great complexity of the real self-assembly mechanism, Evans' calculation provides insight into the delicate problem of stability of toroidal vesicles as well as a good starting point for our discussion of order on the torus.

Although \u03bb 0 = 0 on a flat surface, it is finite and positive-definite on a surface with finite Gaussian curvature [160] . For a sphere of unit radius parametrized in standard spherical coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6), the eigenvalue problem (191) is solved by \u03bb 0 = p and \u03d5 n of the form [169] \u03d5 n = 2p + 1 4\u03c0(p + n)!(p \u2212 n)! sin p+n \u03b8 2 cos p\u2212n \u03b8 2 e in\u03c6 (194) for integer values of n between \u2212p and p.

This is displayed in the phase diagrams of Fig. 42 for the case of vector (p = 1), nematic (p = 2), tetradic (p = 4) and hexatic (p = 6) order. The lines, whose position depends on \u03ba g /\u03ba, separate spheres (above the line) from tori (below the line). Even for simple vector order, stable toroidal vesicles exist as well for \u03ba g /\u03ba < \u03c0 \u2212 2. For \u03ba g /\u03ba > \u03c0 \u2212 2, furthermore, transition lines are closed, with spheres on the inside and tori on the outside. In the shaded regions nonaxisymmetric tori are favored over symmetric ones. The hexatic phase diagram (bottom right corner of Fig. 42 ) deserves special attention. The shaded region is split in two parts. That on the right contains spheres if \u03ba g /\u03ba < \u03c0 \u2212 2 and nonaxisymmetric tori otherwise, while that on the left contains spheres above the transition line and non-axisymmetric tori below. The white region of the phase diagram is also divided in two. The top left region of the diagram behaves as described above, while the other part is characterized by closed lines separating spheres (outside) and small tori (inside). These last class of tori exhibit ten pairs of q = \u00b11 disclinations with positive disclinations distributed on the external equator of the torus and negative disclinations along the internal equator. This last feature is an important property sheared by toroidal objects with in-plane order and will be clarified in the following sections. The results reviewed here are valid within the mean-field approach and the lowest Landau level approximation, which both hold deep in the ordered phase that we are most interested in. At higher temperatures Evans proved the approximations are still valid away from the transition line and for C/A \u03ba/k B T 1 [160] . The latter condition is generally fulfilled by several systems (i.e. \u03ba/k B T = 1 \u2212 10 for lipid bilayers).",

If only this term were present, the attraction would bring both charges as close as possible, binding all disclinations into dipoles which have a higher energy than a defect-free configuration. Thus if no other terms were present, the ground state configuration would be defect free. The defect-curvature interaction term L(x i ), however, favors the appearance of additional defects. This term acts like an electric field pulling the positive (negative) disclinations into regions of positive (negative) Gaussian curvature.",

In the introduction we mentioned the self-assembly of toroidal micelles and vesicles from homogeneous solutions of amphiphilic molecules such as oligomers of aromatic compounds or block copolymers. Toroidal geometries also occur in microbiology in the viral capsid of the coronavirus torovirus [170] . The torovirus is an RNA viral package of maximal diameter between 120 and 140 nm and is surrounded, as other coronaviridae, by a double wreath/ring of cladding proteins. Carbon nanotori form another fascinating and technologically promising class of toroidal crystals [49] with remarkable magnetic and electronic properties. The interplay between the ballistic motion of the \u03c0 electrons and the geometry of the embedding torus leads to a rich variety of quantum mechanical properties including Pauli paramagnetism [171] and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the magnetization [172] . Ring closure of carbon nanotubes by chemical methods [173] suggest that nanotubes may be more flexible than at first thought and provides another technique of constructing carbon tori. In this section we review some recent developments in the study of the geometry and the elasticity of toroidal crystals. Additional details can be found in Refs. [162, 163] .",

According to the Dunlap construction the necessary curvature is incorporated by the insertion of \"knees\" (straight cylindrical sections of the same diameter joined with a kink) in correspondence with each pentagonheptagon pair arising from the junction of tubular segments of different chirality (see Fig. 46 ). In particular, a junction between a (n, 0) and a (m, m) tube can be obtained by placing a 7\u2212fold disclination along the internal equator of the torus and a 5\u2212fold disclination along the external equator. Since the radii of the two segments of a junction are different by construction, the values of n and m are commonly chosen to minimize the ratio |c (n,0) |/|c (m,m) | = n/ \u221a 3m. By repeating the 5 \u2212 7 construction periodically it is possible to construct an infinite number of toroidal lattices with an even number of disclinations pairs and dihedral symmetry group D nh (where 2n is the total number of 5\u22127 pairs, Fig. 45 top and Fig. 47 ). The structure of the lattice is described by the alternation of two motifs with crystalline axes mutually rotated by 30 \u2022 as a consequence of the connecting disclination. One of the fundamental aspects of Dunlap's construction is that all the disclinations are aligned along the two equators of the torus where the like-sign Gaussian curvature is maximal. As we will see below, this feature makes these arrangements optimal in releasing the elastic stress due to curvature. Other defective triangulations with D nh symmetry group have been proposed in Ref. [163] and won't be discussed here.",

            "text": "Another class of crystalline tori with dihedral antiprismatic symmetry D nd was initially proposed by Itoh et al [177, 178, 179] shortly after Dunlap. Aimed at reproducing a structure similar to the C 60 fullerene, Itoh's original construction implied ten disclination pairs and the point group D 5d . In contrast to Dunlap tori, disclinations are never aligned along the equators in antiprismatic tori, instead being staggered at some angular distance \u03b4\u03c8 from the equatorial plane. Hereafter we will use the symbols TPn and TAn to refer to toroidal lattices with 2n disclination pairs and symmetry group D nh and D nd respectively. A systematic construction of defected triangulations of the torus can be achieved in the context of planar graphs [188, 189, 190] . A topological embedding of a graph in a two-dimensional manifold corresponds to a triangulation of the manifold if each region of the graph is bounded by exactly three vertices and three edges, and any two regions have either one common vertex or one common edge or no common elements of the graph. The simplest example of toroidal polyhedra with D nd symmetry group, featuring only 5\u2212fold and 7\u2212fold vertices, can be constructed by repeating n times the unit cell of Fig. 48a . These toroidal antiprisms have V = 4n vertices and can be obtained equivalently from the edge skeleton of a n\u2212fold antiprism by attaching at each of the base edges a pentagonal pyramid and by closing the upper part of the polyhedron with n additional triangles. By counting the faces one finds F = 5n + 2n + n = 8n from which V = 4n. The simplest polyhedron of this family has V = 12 and D 3d symmetry group (see top left of Fig. 49 ) and corresponds to the \"drilled icosahedron\" obtained by removing two parallel faces of an icosahedron and connecting the corresponding edges with the six lateral faces of an antiprism with triangular base (i.e. a prolate octahedron). Starting from this family of toroidal antiprisms a number of associated triangulations having the same defect structure can be obtained by geometrical transformations such as the Goldberg inclusion [39, 191, 192] . Such transformations, popularized by Caspar and Klug for the construction of the icosadeltahedral structure of spherical viruses [39] , consist in partitioning each triangular face of the original graph into smaller triangular faces in such a way that old vertices preserve their valence and new vertices have valence six. The partition is obtained by specifying two integer numbers (L, M ) which define how the original vertices of each triangle are connected by the new edges so that the total number of vertices is increased by a factor T = L 2 + LM + M 2 .",

For dimensionless core energies below 4\u00b710 \u22125 and aspect ratios r between 3.68 and 10.12 the ground state structure is the TP5 lattice corresponding to a double ring of +1 and \u22121 disclinations distributed on the external and internal equators of the torus as the vertices of a regular decagon (the T 10 configuration). The TP5 lattice has dihedral symmetry group D 5h . That this structure might represent a stable configuration for polygonal carbon toroids has been conjectured by the authors of Ref. [186] , based on the argument that the 36 \u2022 angle arising from the insertion of ten pentagonal-heptagonal pairs into the lattice would optimize the geometry of a nanotorus consistently with the structure of the sp 2 bonds of the carbon network (unlike the 30 \u2022 angle of the 6\u2212fold symmetric configuration originally proposed by Dunlap) . In later molecular dynamics simulations, Han [194, 195] found that a 5\u2212fold symmetric lattice, such as the one obtained from a (9,0)/(5,5) junction (see Fig. 47 ), is in fact stable for toroids with aspect ratio less then r \u223c 10. The stability, in this case, results from the strain energy per atom being smaller than the binding energy of carbon atoms. Irrespective of the direct experimental observation of such disclinated toroidal crystals, which is still open, we show here how continuum elasticity predicts that a 5\u2212fold symmetric lattice indeed constitutes a minimum of the elastic energy for a broad range of aspect ratios and defect core energies.",

In a manifold with variable Gaussian curvature this effects leads to a regime of coexistence of isolated disclinations (in regions of large curvature) and scars.

The choice of the cubic potential is motivated here by the so called \"poppy seed bagel theorem\" [80] , according to which the configuration of points that minimizes the Riesz energy E = i<j 1/|x i \u2212 x j | s on a rectifiable manifold of Hausdorff dimension d is uniformly distributed on the manifold for s \u2265 d. In the case of a torus of revolution this implies that for small s the points are mostly distributed on the exterior of the torus (the interior becomes completely empty in the limit V \u2192 \u221e). As s is increased, however, the points cover a progressively larger portion of the surface. The distribution becomes uniform for s \u2265 2. On the other hand, since the number of local minima of the Riesz energy increases with s, it is practical to choose a value not much larger than two. The choice s = 3 has the further advantage of modelling a real physical system of neutral colloidal particles assembled at an interface [36] and is therefore suitable for direct comparison with experiments on colloidal suspensions. The lowest energies found, as well as the number of defects in the corresponding configuration, are reported in Table 7 . The complete set of data produced in these simulations together with a collection of interactive 3D graphics for each low energy configuration studied can be found on-line [196] .",

It is therefore natural to ask whether large curvature can completely destroy crystalline order by driving the proliferation of a sufficiently high density of defects. The resulting state would be amorphous. The problem of generating amorphous structures by tiling a two-dimensional curved space with identical rigid subunits has drawn attention over the years, particularly through the connection to the structure of such disordered materials as supercooled liquids and metallic glasses. Since the work of Frank [197] the notion of geometrical frustration arises frequently in investigations of supercooled liquids and the glass transition. A paradigmatic example is represented by the icosahedral order in metallic liquids and glasses which, although locally favored, cannot propagate throughout all of threedimensional Euclidean space. A two-dimensional analog, consisting of a liquid of monodisperse hard disks in a 2-manifold of constant negative Gaussian curvature (the hyperbolic plane) was first proposed by Nelson and coworkers in 1983 [17, 198] . In such a system the impossibility of covering the entire manifold with a 6-fold coordinated array of disks mimics many aspects of the geometrical frustration of icosahedral order in three dimensions. In all these models of geometrical frustration, however, the origin of the disorder is primarily due to the short-range nature of the potential between the subunits. In a more realistic setting, part of the frustration is relieved by the fact that hexagonal unit cells can compress in order to match the underlying geometry.",

            "text": "In this section we this claim can be supported using the elastic theory of continuous distributions of edge dislocations on a \"fat\" torus. Our argument is based on the following construction. As a consequence of the curvature singularity the surface area of an arbitrary wedge of angular width \u2206\u03c6 becomes smaller and smaller as the sectional angle \u03c8 increases and vanishes at \u03c8 = \u03c0. If a defect-free lattice is embedded on such a wedge, Bragg rows will become closer and closer as the singularity is approached with a consequent rise in the elastic energy (see Fig. 55 ). An intuitive way to reduce the distortion of the lattice is to recursively remove Bragg rows as one approaches the point \u03c8 = \u03c0 (see Fig. 56 ). This is equivalent to introducing a growing density of edge dislocations. This dislocation \"cloud\" will ultimately disorder the system by destroying the local 6\u2212fold bond orientational order. One might therefore view the curvature as playing the role of a local effective temperature which can drive \"melting\" by liberating disclinations and dislocations. In two-dimensional non-Euclidean crystals at T = 0, however, the mechanism for dislocation proliferation is fundamentally different from the usual thermal melting. While the latter is governed by an entropy gain due to unbinding of dislocation pairs, the amorphization at T = 0 is due to the adjustment of the lattice to the geometry of the embedding manifold via the proliferation of defects and the consequent release of elastic stress. A similar phenomenon occurs in the disorder-driven amorphization of vortex lattices in type-II and high-T c superconductors [199, 200, 201] . Since the shrinking area per plaquette on the inside of the torus necessitates a high density of dislocations we may approximate the dislocation cloud in this region by a continuous distribution of Burgers vector density b. Minimizing the elastic energy with respect to b yields a variational equation from which the optimal dislocation density can be calculated as a function of the ratio d /(Y R 2 ) between the dislocation core energy d and elastic energy scale Y R 2 with R = R 1 = R 2 .",

The solid blue curve in Fig. 57 represents the zeroth order solution of Eq.(230). Now, in the theory of dislocation mediated melting a system at the solid liquid phase boundary is described as a crystalline solid saturated with dislocations. In three-dimensions, in particular, there is a strong experimental evidence of the existence of a critical dislocation density at the melting point \u03c1(T m ) \u2248 0.6b \u22122 where b is the length of the length of the smallest perfect-dislocation Burgers vector [203] . Several theoretical works have motivated this evidence both for three-dimensional solids and vortex lattices in super conductors [200] . On the other hand, given the existence of such a critical density, its value can be empirically used to determine whether a system is in a solid or liquid-like phase in the same spirit as the Lindemann criterion. With this goal in mind we can calculate the dislocation density by requiring |b| = \u03c1a with \u03c1 the density of single lattice spacing dislocations. This yields:",

The purely curvature driven energetic nature of the latter phenomenon is of fundamental interest. On the material science side, non-Euclidean systems provides a promising route to constructing arrays of nanoparticles via the chemical functionalization of topological defects created on the surface of the particles by coating them with an ordered monolayer. Candidates for such coatings include triblock coplymers, gemini lipids, metallic or semiconducting nanorods and conventional liquid crystal compounds. If the induced order is vector-like or striped, then there must necessarily be two defective regions corresponding to the bald spots exhibited by a combed sphere or the source and sink of fluid flow confined to a sphere. Not only are the defects physically and mathematically distinguished, since the condensed matter order vanishes there, but it also turns out that chemical processes can detect the defects and insert linker molecules at the precise defect locations. This creates the possibility of efficiently making functionalized nanoparticles with a precise valence and corresponding directional bonding. The nanoparticles themselves can then be linked into well-defined two and three dimensional arrays. Control over the valence and the geometry of the directional bonding can be achieved by varying the nature of the ordered monolayer.",
