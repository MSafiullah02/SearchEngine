            "text": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a worldwide health problem with elevated rate of mortality and disability [1]. Brain-injured patients with altered consciousness frequently require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation to protect the airways from aspiration and to prevent harmful secondary insults, such as hypoxemia [generally defined as an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 60 mmHg] and hypercapnia [generally defined as an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) > 45 mmHg] [2]. TBI patients may develop severe respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during intensive care unit (ICU) stay [3, 4]. Lung-protective ventilation strategies, with low tidal volumes (TVs) and moderate-to-high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), are associated with improved outcomes in ARDS and non-ARDS patients [5, 6] and are characterized by \u201clow ranges\u201d oxygenation targets and permissive hypercapnia [7, 8]. This approach, considering its potential adverse cerebrovascular effects, is difficult to apply in TBI patients, regardless of the presence of intracranial hypertension [2, 9, 10]. Traditionally, in TBI patients, low PEEP and high TVs are generally applied for tight CO2 control [5]; however, recent evidence suggests that, even in TBI patients, the use of high TVs is associated with the development of acute lung injury [9, 11]. As such, brain-injured patients have been excluded from the major trials exploring the effect of lung-protective ventilation strategies in ARDS [12, 13], and consequently optimal ventilatory strategies have not been established yet in this setting [14, 15]. We therefore performed an international survey with the aim to investigate the practice in the respiratory management of TBI patients, with and without respiratory failure.",

Two main subdivisions were considered in the population: one based on geographic area (Europe vs. Others), one based on ICU characteristics [specialized neuro-ICU (NICU) vs. non-specialized NICU]. Results for the population as a whole and for the sub-group subdivision are reported. Differences between groups (e.g. specialized NICU vs. non-specialized NICU, Europe vs. Others) were assessed using a chi-squared test for binary variables in 2 \u00d7 2 or r \u00d7 c contingency tables. Cells with fewer than 5 cases were grouped with other cells taking care that the new group was clinically appropriate. For the questions where more than one test was necessary (for example questions concerning rescue strategies), a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was adopted. Stata software release 13.0 was used for the statistical analysis (StataCorp, 2013, Stata Statistical Software, Release 13; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).

            "text": "The application of PEEP, as well as low TVs, is an important component of lung-protective ventilation [7]. PEEP reduces atelectasis and improves PaO2 and lung compliance [7]. Traditionally, low PEEP levels (\u2264 5 mmHg) have been utilized in acute brain injury patients admitted to ICU [5], because of the potential risks on cerebral circulation and intracranial pressure (ICP); in particular, the effect of PEEP on ICP seems to be related to both hemodynamic factors and respiratory system compliance [9, 10]. Elevated PEEP levels may reduce systemic venous return, mean arterial pressure and consequently cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) with detrimental consequences on cerebral blood flow (CBF), mainly in cases of altered cerebral autoregulation [16]. On the other hand, respiratory system compliance influences the effect of PEEP on ICP and brain circulation [17\u201319]: in patients with low compliance, a PEEP increase (up to 10\u201312 cmH2O) is not associated with ICP increase; in contrast, in patients with normal compliance, PEEP induces lung overdistension, reduction in cerebral venous return and ICP increases. We found that most of our respondents utilize lower PEEP levels in case of intracranial hypertension, thus suggesting that there is still concern regarding the cerebrovascular effects of PEEP on ICP. However, surprisingly, our results show that physicians are keen to use quite high PEEPs (up to 15 in patients with PaO2/FiO2 > 300) in patients without intracranial hypertension, which is in contrast with growing evidence challenging the utility of \u201copen lung approach\u201d [20]. Probably, the availability of adequate neuro and cardiorespiratory monitoring tools could be useful in setting the right level of PEEP, but more prospective randomized studies are needed to identify the correct level of PEEP in head-injured patients.",

            "text": "As with all methods of data collection, survey research also comes with a few drawbacks as inflexibility and validity. This survey presents also other limitations. First, the response rate cannot be calculated considering the design of this survey; in fact, ESICM members are invited to involve more participants locally, thus making impossible to obtain the total number of people who received the survey. Second, respondents from specialized NICUs were included together with those working in general ICUs. This might be considered a methodological limitation but, as TBI patients are treated worldwide not only in specialized NICUs, we believe that our approach produced more generalizable findings. Third, this survey was developed by two investigators without a prior systematic review of the literature or pilot testing in a smaller sample of participants; this might further limit the quality of the questionnaire and data. Fourth, this survey refers only to physicians\u2019 clinical practice in respiratory management of TBI without including patients\u2019 data.",

Lung-protective ventilation strategies seem to be more frequently applied in the clinical practice in brain-injured patients, although most respondents still seem to have concerns regarding the use of high PEEP in case of intracranial hypertension. Future studies are warranted to clarify the huge practice variability among centres.",
