Primary immunodefi ciencies (PID), hemoglobinopathies, and hematologic malignancies present different challenges. Even in hematologic malignancies, the risk may vary depending on the specifi c condition: patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) present different risks based on both the biology of the disease and prior treatment. These factors should be considered when assessing individual patients. Prior infections must be considered. A history of infection or colonization with a multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) like carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria (CRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has implications regarding optimal management of fever during neutropenia [ 6 , 11 , 12 ] , which is a common complication of HCT. Transplant candidates are routinely screened for serologic evidence of latent infections that may reactivate (HSV, VZV, CMV, EBV, hepatitis B and C, toxoplasmosis); some of these will be discussed later in this chapter. Some transplant centers will perform screening for tuberculosis with tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), at least for patients who are considered at signifi cant risk for the disease. Prior invasive fungal infections may reactivate following transplant, and secondary prophylaxis is required [ 13 -15 ] . Even active fungal infection has been reported to be controllable. There are, however, cases of progression of prior aspergillosis after transplant; myeloablative conditioning, prolonged neutropenia, cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are risk factors [ 15 , 16 ] .",

Recipient's mutations in MBL2 , the gene that encodes mannose-binding lectin (MBL), have been associated with increased risk of infection after neutrophil recovery following myeloablative transplant [ 18 ] .

This framework originated with myeloablative transplants, and is eminently pragmatic. The pre-engraftment phase may be accompanied by profound neutropenia and signifi cant mucositis, which results in increased risk of bacterial infections from the resident gastrointestinal fl ora, candidiasis, aspergillosis (in cases of prolonged neutropenia) and herpes simplex virus reactivation. After engraftment, with neutropenia no longer being a factor, many infections are related to the profound defect in cellular immunity caused by the conditioning regimen and the immunosuppression administered to prevent GVHD. CMV reactivation and the development of acute GVHD and its treatment play a central role during this time. The day 100 landmark derives from the standard time at which immunosuppression (e.g., cyclosporine A or tacrolimus) is frequently tapered. Infections after this point would be primarily related to lack of immune reconstitution and, in the absence of GVHD, become progressively less common.",

Table 6 -1 summarizes the impact of these factors on infections. Matching for UCB transplants focuses on three loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1). The majority of UCB transplants are mismatched by at least one locus (often two). Among transplants mismatched at two loci, mismatching at HLA-C and HLA-DRB1 was associated with the highest risk of mortality [ 24 ] .",

T cell depletion may minimize or altogether prevent GVHD but may result in prolonged immunodeficiency, depending on the degree of depletion. If an unmanipulated product is used, T cell depletion may be attained in vivo by using alemtuzumab or ATG. These agents produce a profound depletion of T cells in vivo, and their long halflife makes them still be present and active in the recipient when the stem cell product is administered. If no in vitro or in vivo T cell depletion is used, one of a variety of immunosuppressive regimens will be given to prevent GVHD (e.g., tacrolimus + methotrexate, tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A, sirolimus, posttransplant cyclophosphamide). A randomized controlled trial documented more infections in patients randomized to (moderate) T cell depletion than in the group who received pharmacologic immunosuppression [ 32 ] . T cell depletion in vivo with alemtuzumab has been associated with increased risk of infection [ 33 ] . It is possible that different pharmacological regimens may result in different infectious risks, but this has not been adequately studied. Preliminary evidence suggests that a sirolimus-based regimen may result in less CMV reactivation [ 34 ] and that posttransplant cyclophosphamide result in relatively decreased risk of PTLD [ 35 ].",

The clinical syndrome of typical chronic GVHD is quite distinct from the acute form, and a new classifi cation focusing on the clinical characteristics of the disease as well as on the timing is being increasingly used [ 39 ] . From the standpoint of infectious diseases, the important consideration is that the presence of chronic GVHD is associated with high risk of infection [ 40 , 41 ] . Multiple immune defects have been described during chronic GVHD, involving humoral and cellular immunity [ 42 , 43 ] as well as functional hyposplenism [ 44 , 45 ] . Besides these abnormalities, that result in delayed immune reconstitution and poor response to immunizations, the risk is of infection is increased by the treatment of extensive cGVHD [ 41 ], which typically includes systemic corticosteroids and a variety of steroid-sparing agents. Notably, cGVHD is a well-documented risk for pneumococcal infections [ 45 , 46 ] , fungal infections, and late CMV disease. However, all types of infections are more common during cGVHD, particularly during the fi rst few months [ 47 ] .",

This situation is important from the infectious disease standpoint because patients are usually treated with a variety of highly immunosuppressive regimens (e.g., ATG, cyclophosphamide, MMF, infl iximab, daclizumab, alefacept, alemtuzumab, sirolimus, visilizumab, denileukin diftitox, and others) [ 48 ] that result in a wide array of infectious complications. Reactivation of CMV is very common, as are fungal infections [ 49 , 50 ] , Epstein-Barr virus-related PTLD [ 51 ] , as well as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) [ 52 ] and adenovirus [ 53 ] . There are no controlled studies to support any particular infection prevention strategy during this period of increased immunosuppression, but some authors have emphasized that early use of prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals is an essential part of a successful approach to this problem [ 54 ] . Unfortunately, this is a condition for which controlled trials are unlikely to be performed, and different centers will have to decide on a particular approach of close monitoring versus prophylaxis based on local experience and published case series.",

In some centers, the most frequent Gram-positive isolates are viridans group Streptococcus [ 55 ] ; this may be a function of the conditioning regimen or the patient population. Enterococcus faecium , frequently VRE, is another Gram-positive organism that tends to cause bloodstream infection relatively early, although this seems to be rather institution dependent [ 57 ] . The Gram-negative bacteria are commonly Enterobacteriaceae . These infections are generally related to the disruption of the GI mucosa due to the preparative regimen. The role of reduced diversity of the microbiota with subsequent bacterial domination and ultimately bacteremia is an area of intense study [ 58 ] . The risk of bacteremia during neutropenia may be decreased by the use of prophylactic antibiotics [ 59 , 60 ] . This had been shown in multiple studies over the years, but the recommendation of using antibiotics did not become part of practice guidelines until recently. It is not clear whether this recommendation will continue amidst the increasing concern over the role of antibiotic-induced decreased microbiome diversity on the outcome of HCT [ 61 ] . In this regard it is of interest that fl uoroquinolones seem to have less detrimental effects on biodiversity of the fecal fl ora than beta-lactams. Levofl oxacin at a dose of 500 mg/d for patients who are going to be profoundly neutropenic for longer than 1 week is the current recommendation of the IDSA [ 11 ].",

It is likely that local epidemiology determines whether screening is an effi cacious and costeffective approach to either prevent infection or improve outcomes. A retrospective study on VRE bacteremia from the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center showed that VRE carriage was predictive of subsequent VRE bacteremia, but failed to detect the pathogen in many patients [ 63 ] . Performing surveillance cultures for resistant organisms in vulnerable patient populations is part of the CDC recommendations \"Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings, 2006\" [ 64 ] , and has been vigorously advocated by some experts [ [ 66 , 67 ] . Both early and late (beyond day 100) pneumococcal disease has been reported, with late infections strongly associated with active cGVHD [ 46 ] . These have been attributed to inadequate antibody production and functional hyposplenism [ 44 , 67 ] . Vaccination against S. pneumoniae should be given to all HCT recipients, starting 3-6 months after transplant and using the 13-valent conjugate vaccine [ 9 ] (see Chap. 48 for details). Four doses of the vaccine result in enhanced antibody response and tolerable side effects [ 68 ] . Antibiotic prophylaxis against S. pneumoniae prophylaxis for adults with active cGVHD has been recommended [ 69 ] , although there is only weak evidence supporting its effi cacy. Penicillin V-K is safe and well tolerated, but the local patterns of penicillin resistance may make other antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, or levofl oxacin) preferable, although their long-term safety is not well established. Late bacterial infections often involve the respiratory tract. Pneumonia is the most common cause of fatal late infection [ 40 , 70 ] . Chronic GVHD is the risk factor most commonly identifi ed. Besides S. pneumoniae , multiple other pathogens have been reported. Nocardia also tends to occur late and in patients with cGVHD [ 71 , 72 ] . Mycobacterial infections are uncommon and diffi cult to diagnose [ 73 ] . Risk factors for the development of active TB include GVHD, corticosteroid treatment, and total body irradiation (TBI) [ 74 ] . The need for universal testing for tuberculosis is controversial, given the unknown sensitivity and specifi city of the tests in this population and the fact that tuberculosis is a relatively uncommon complication after HCT (albeit still approximately three times higher than in the general population) [ Invasive candidiasis follows prior colonization and favorable conditions for the yeast: disruption of the GI mucosa during chemotherapy or acute GVHD, overgrowth in the presence of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and/or presence of indwelling catheters (the catheter seems to be the main risk factor in the case of C. parapsilosis ). Early studies showed that fl uconazole during the pre-engraftment period could decrease the incidence of invasive candidiasis [ 76 , 77 ] . Accordingly, fl uconazole is recommended as part of the standard prophylactic regimen during the pre-engraftment period. The prevalent use of fl uconazole has resulted in substantial decrease in the incidence of infections caused by C. albicans with relative increases in the incidence of other species of Candida with decreased susceptibility to this agent (e.g., C. glabrata , C. krusei ) [ 78 ] .",

Similarly, it is reasonable to question the indication for fl uconazole during periods when the main fungal infection is aspergillosis. Several randomized controlled trials have compared fl uconazole with another azole with activity against molds (itraconazole [ 87 , 88 ] , voriconazole [ 89 ] , or posaconazole [ 90 ] ) either as standard posttransplant prophylaxis or during periods of increased risk. The general conclusion of these trials is that the aspergillus-active drugs are, indeed, more effective than fl uconazole in preventing IA, but the benefi t in survival in the context of a clinical trial with careful monitoring of galactomannan antigen is hard to demonstrate [ 91 ] . The 2009 ASBMT/EBMT Guidelines recommend posaconazole or voriconazole as antifungal prophylaxis in the setting of GVHD and micafungin in the setting of prolonged neutropenia [ 1 ] . Of note, posaconazole prophylaxis was superior to fl uconazole or itraconazole and improved survival in prolonged neutropenia in non-transplant patients [ 92 ] .

Hypoxemia is characteristic at presentation. Atypical radiological manifestations, including nodular infi ltrates and pleural effusions (in contrast to typical interstitial pneumonitis), are described frequently, as is the presence of co-pathogens [ 148 ] . The preferred prophylaxis is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) , and several dosing regimens are effective (one single-strength tablet daily, one double-strength tablet daily, or one double-strength tablet three times/week) [ 149 ] . TMP/ SMX may be poorly tolerated because of hematologic toxicity, skin rash and/or gastrointestinal toxicity [ 150 ] . It is unclear which is the prophylaxis of choice if TMP/ SMX cannot be used. Aerosolized pentamidine is convenient, obviates the problem of compliance, and is less toxic than dapsone and better tolerated than atovaquone. However, it has been reportedly associated with more failures than dapsone [ 150 ] . Dapsone seemed to be effective and well tolerated in one study [ 151 ] but not in another when it was given only three times per week [ 152 ] . Dapsone should not be given to patients with G6PD defi ciency. Methemoglobinemia is a well-known complication of dapsone [ 153 ] that should be considered in the presence of unexplained shortness of breath. Atovaquone suspension 1500 mg/d may be used, but published experience in HSCT recipients is limited [ 154 , 155 ] . Atovaquone is expensive and poor tolerance has made compliance for some patients diffi cult. Absorption is better in the presence of signifi cant amount of fat, and breakthroughs are well documented ( Figure 6-4 ) . PCP prophylaxis is recommended at least until all immunosuppression has been stopped but it is unclear how much longer to continue it [ 156 ] .",

Recipients should be tested for anti-toxoplasma IgG antibody, and if they are found to be positive, prophylaxis is recommended. Rare cases of toxoplasmosis after HCT have occurred in seronegative recipients [ 158 , 159 ] . The disease tends to occur within the fi rst 6 months after transplant, but it can happen later in the presence of persistent immunosuppression [ 160 -162 ] . The risk of toxoplasmosis varies with the type of transplant and the immunosuppression: cord blood and use of ATG were found to be risk factors for disease in a prospective study [ 162 ] ; most cases in another series occurred in URD or mismatched transplants [ 107 ] . TMP/SMX as given for PCP prophylaxis is considered adequate to prevent toxoplasmosis, although there have been cases on HCT recipients who were receiving it [ 162 ] . The best alternative for patients who are intolerant to TMP/SMX is unknown. Dapsone and atovaquone showed some effi cacy in HIV-infected patients and there is increasing experience after HCT [ 163 ] , although failures have been reported. Other regimens include clindamycin with pyrimethamine and leucovorin, pyrimethamine with sulfadiazine, or pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine and leucovorin [ 107 ] . If a reliable quantitative PCR assay is available, frequent monitoring and preemptive treatment may be appropriate, since PCRdetected reactivation seems to precede symptoms by 4-16 days [ 162 ] . Retrospective data suggest this strategy may result in improved outcome [ 164 ] .",

Type of transplant and infectious disease risk CSF granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, GVHD graft-versus-host disease, CMV cytomegalovirus, ATG anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin, EBV-related PTLD Epstein-Barr virus-related posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) indicate that there is a direct association between the number of donor-recipient HLA mismatches and the risk for mortality [ 24 ]. The current standard aims for high-resolution matching at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1 (i.e.Haploidentical transplants are one special type of mismatched transplant, where the donor shares at least one complete haplotype with the recipient. Most candidates for transplant have a potential haploidentical donor. The successful use of a regimen of posttransplant cyclophosphamide to prevent GVHD in the haploidentical setting has resulted in an increasing number of this type of transplant being performed during the last decade [ 25 ]. Interestingly, early data suggest haploidentical transplants do not result in delayed immune reconstitution or increased infections [ 26 ].",
