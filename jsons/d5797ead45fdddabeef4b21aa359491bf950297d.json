After a message is received, the connector checks for data integrity syntactically and invokes the data normalization subroutine. Then the connector stores the verified message in the portal's internal data store through its data ingest control module. Other data sources (e.g., those from USGS) may have \"pull\"-type connectors which periodically download information from the source web sites and examine and store data in the portal's internal data store.",

The top-left panel shows the GIs view. The user can select multiple datasets to be shown on the map in a layered manner using the checkboxes. The topright panel corresponds to the timeline view displaying the occurrences of various cases using a Gantt chart-like display. The user can also access case details easily using the tree display located left of the timeline display. Below the timeline view is the periodic view through which the user can identify periodic temporal patterns (e.g., which months have an unusually high number of cases). The bottom portion of the interface allows the user to specify subsets of data to be displayed and analyzed.",

Automatic detection of dead bird clusters using hotspot analysis can help predict disease outbreaks and allocate prevention/control resources effectively. Initial experimental results indicate that these techniques are promising for disease informatics analysis. We are planning to augment existing predictive models by considering additional environmental factors (e.g., weather information, bird migration patterns) and tailoring data mining techniques for infectious disease datasets that have prominent temporal features.

For instance, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene collected geo-coded information concerning dead birds infected by West Nile Virus (WNV). Applying retrospective methods to avian fatality data, they were able to detect possible WNV outbreaks before human case data became available (Zeng et al., 2004).",

Although a wide range of methods have been proposed for retrospective spatio-temporal data analysis, the space scan statistic, in particular, has become one of the most popular methods for detection of disease clusters and is being widely used by many public health departments and researchers. Algorithmically, the space scan statistic method imposes a circular window on the map under study and moves the center of the circle over the area so that at different positions the window includes different sets of neighboring cases. Over the course of data analysis, the method creates a large number of distinct circular windows (other shapes such as rectangle and ellipse have also been used), each with a different set of neighboring areas within it and each a possible candidate for containing a cluster of events. Conditioning on the observed total number of cases, the spatial scan statistic is defined as the maximum likelihood ratio over all possible circles. The likelihood ratio for a circle indicates how likely the observed data are given a differential rate of events within and outside the zone.",

As a result, when the real underlying clusters do not conform to such shapes, the identified regions are often not well localized. Second, it is difficult to customize and fine-tune the clustering results using the scan statistic approach. Users often have different needs as to the level of granularity and number of the resulting clusters and they may have different degrees of tolerance regarding outliers.",

The standard NNH approach identifies clusters of data points that are close together (based on a threshold distance). Many such clusters, however, are due to some background or baseline factors (e.g., the population which is not evenly distributed over the entire area of interest). RNNH is primarily motivated to identify clusters of data points relative to the baseline factor. Algorithmically, it dynamically adjusts the threshold distance inversely proportional to some density measure of the baseline factor (e.g., the threshold should be shorter in regions where the population is high). Such density measures are computed using kernel density based on the distances between the location under study and some or all other data points.",

SVMs are the most well-known of a class of algorithms that use the idea of kernel substitution. SVM-based data description and novelty detection (DDND) is particularly relevant to our research. SVM-based DDND methods are aimed at identifying the support of a data distribution. They can single out data clusters in complex shapes and have been well-tested in complex, noisy domains (e.g., handwritten symbol recognition). The standard version of SVM-based DDND does not tale into consideration baseline data points and therefore cannot be directly used in spatio-temporal data analysis. As such, we have developed a risk-adjusted variation, called RSVC, based on ideas similar to those in RNNH. In this new approach we first compute the kernel density estimations using the baseline data points and then adjust width parameter in the Gaussian kernel hnction based on such density estimations.",

Table 9 -1 summarizes these methods' average performance across all instances. Overall RSVC achieves the best F-score at 84.5%. Two additional scenarios have been investigated in our study. In Scenario 2, the true hotspots are the two pieces left of a rectangle when its middle section is removed by a circle. In Scenario 3, the true spot is a square with its circular-shaped center removed. The purpose behind the use of these scenarios is to test how robust these hotspot methods are when dealing with hotspots of irregular shape. Tables 9-2 and 9-3 summarize the average performance of these methods when applied to identify hotspots in 30 randomly-generated instances of Scenario 2 and Scenario 3, respectively. Some observations are in order. In general, RSVC and the spatial scan method have similar levels of recall across different scenarios. However, RSVC has higher precision than the spatial scan method (confirmed by statistical tests). RNNH has the highest precision level but typically with the lowest recall. When considering the combined F-measure, RSVC consistently delivers the best results. For complex, irregular shapes, RSVC typically performs the best among the three techniques. We believe RSVC could be a strong candidate for hotspot identification in national security applications (e.g., disease surveillance, crime hotspot analysis).",
