            "text": "Malaria caused by Plasmodium, particularly P. falciparum, is the most serious and widespread parasitic disease of humans. Each year approximately 300\u2013500 million people become infected with malaria and 2\u20133 million die as a result. The malaria parasite has a four-stage life cycle as it passes from humans to mosquitoes and back again. The parasite is very efficient at evading the human immune response. A malaria vaccine would be the ultimate weapon to fight this deadly disease but unfortunately despite encouraging advances a vaccine is not likely soon. Anti-malarial drugs are the last certain defense but due to the rapid spread of resistance of both the parasite and the mosquito vector to currently available anti-malarial drugs and insecticides, control of malaria is becoming increasingly difficult. There is a need to bring new classes of drugs, both alone and in combination to meet the future challenges of drug resistance and other areas of medical needs. There are a limited number of drugs in widespread use for treatment of P. falciparum malaria and a lack of new affordable drugs (Winstanley, 2000). P. falciparum has developed resistance to nearly all the available anti-malarial drugs (White, 1998, Hyde, 2005). The rational development of novel and affordable drugs for the treatment of malaria and the identification of new drug targets is an important goal. The recent completion of Malaria Genome Project and availability of new technologies for genome wide comparison of genomes will help to identify key targets in biochemical pathways that are parasite specific and can be interrupted without deleterious consequences for the host. The genome of P. falciparum has 14 chromosomes (which encode about 5400 genes), a circular plastid-like genome and a linear mitochondrial genome (Bozdech et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The completed genome of P. falciparum has opened new avenues for research. It has been reported that homologues for a number of genes are present in the genome of the parasite (Gardner et al., 2002). On the other hand the studies report that of the 5268 predicted proteins, about 60% did not contain adequate resemblance to proteins reported in other organisms. This may be due to the A + T richness of the Plasmodium genome. It is interesting to note that the overall (A + T) composition of P. falciparum genome is \u223c 81% and it increases to \u223c 90% in introns and intergenic regions (Gardner et al., 2002). Studies have indicated that overall the proteins from P. falciparum are consistently larger than their homologous counterparts from other species (Pizzi and Frontali, 2001). This size difference can normally be attributed to the presence of long insertions, which separate the well-conserved regions that are flanking in the homologous proteins (Pizzi and Frontali, 2000, Pizzi and Frontali, 2001). Previous studies have indicated that the genes for DNA metabolism such as DNA replication, repair and recombination are present in the genome of P. falciparum and the apicoplast of P. falciparum also contains a gene encoding contiguous DNA polymerase, DNA primase and DNA helicase components (Gardner et al., 2002, Seow et al., 2005).",

            "text": "DNA recombination, repair and replication are necessary for the maintenance and the reliable transmission of genetic information to the offspring. Each of these processes requires opening of the double helix to provide a single-stranded template. Helicases are enzymes, which catalyze the unwinding of nucleic acid duplexes in an NTP-dependent manner. Therefore all the helicases contain a distinct nucleic acid binding site and an NTP-binding site. These enzymes are also called \u201cmolecular motors\u201d that use the energy of hydrolysis of NTP to separate energetically stable duplex momentarily into single strands. These are important enzymes, which play essential roles in all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. The helicase genes have been found in a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to eukaryotes (Tuteja and Tuteja, 2004a). It is interesting to note that in the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are 134 open reading frames, which code for helicase-like proteins (Shiratori et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Primary structure sequence analysis and comparisons of a number of helicases from a variety of organisms have revealed the presence of seven to nine short highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs or fingerprints which are known as \u2018helicase signature motifs\u2019 and are designated as Q, I, Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V and VI (Hodgman, 1988, Gorbalenya et al., 1988, Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993, Tanner, 2003, Tuteja and Tuteja, 2004b). Various structural studies have shown that in three-dimensional structure of the protein these motifs are generally clustered in the middle of the protein to form an ATP-hydrolyzing pocket, which is capable of providing energy for the unwinding activity (Hall and Matson, 1999). Due to the presence of DEAD, DEAH or DEXH in motif II, this family of helicases is also known as the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 protein family (Gorbalenya et al., 1988, Gorbalenya et al., 1989, Linder et al., 1989). Similar to helicases this family of proteins is also present ubiquitously ranging from bacteria to mammals (Tuteja and Tuteja, 2004a). Some partial genes of this family have also been reported from the malaria parasites P. falciparum and P. cynomolgi (Song et al., 1999). It has been reported that humans have 36 members and S. cerevisiae has 26 members of the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 family of helicases (de la Cruz et al., 1999, Abdelhaleem et al., 2003). The structural studies of various RNA and DNA helicases have shown that there is a close association between the conserved motifs and the three-dimensional structures of the enzymatic cores (Tanner and Linder, 2001). These observations suggest that although various helicases have different biological activities, their catalytic cores are almost identical (Hall and Matson, 1999, Tanner and Linder, 2001). \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 helicases also have roles in ribosome biogenesis and act by way of regulation of small ribosomal and nucleolar RNAs. Two members of this \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 family, eIF-4A and p68 have been well characterized and shown to contain ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity (Hirling et al., 1989, Rozen et al., 1990). Mutational analysis of eIF-4A and p68 indicate that these are required for cell growth and translation in yeast and other systems (Schmid and Linder, 1991, Wassarman and Steitz, 1991). It has been suggested that in humans the helicases of the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 family have roles in differentiation and carcinogenesis (Abdelhaleem et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The discovery of \u2018helicase signature motifs\u2019 resulted in the classification of these important proteins into three distinct super-families (SF) such as SF1, SF2 and SF3. This classification is based on the extent of similarity and organization of the helicase signature motifs (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993). SF1 and 2 represent the major and closely related super-families, which contain at least seven conserved motifs such as I, Ia, II\u2013VI. The members of these families contain enzymes from a variety of organisms such as bacteria to humans. On the other hand SF3 is very small and contains the viral Rep-like helicases. It has been observed that the conserved motifs of SF1 and SF2 are generally clustered in the central 200\u2013700 amino acids known as the \u2018core-region\u2019 of the protein. The crystal structure comparison studies between SF1 and SF2 have revealed that the helicases are highly conserved at the structural level throughout evolution (Hall and Matson, 1999). The stretches of low sequence but high length conservation separate the various conserved motifs. Contrary to this, the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are characterized by a high degree of sequence as well as length variability. It is well documented now that the highly conserved motifs are responsible for ATP-binding and hydrolysis or binding and unwinding of nucleic acid duplexes. However the divergent N- and C-terminal regions have been suggested to be responsible for individual protein functions (Hall and Matson, 1999). It has also been postulated that the non-conserved or subsidiary part of the various helicase proteins may contain special domains responsible for protein\u2013protein interaction, cellular localization and oligomerization (Hall and Matson, 1999). These domains can also directly bind to the specific nucleic acid substrate and help to deliver the helicase enzyme to its place of action (Silverman et al., 2003). The \u2018Q motif\u2019, which was discovered recently, has been shown to be involved in ATP-binding and hydrolysis (Tanner, 2003, Tanner et al., 2003).",

This motif is present in many nucleotide-binding proteins also and forms a phosphate binding loop or \u2018P loop\u2019 (Tanner and Linder, 2001). The consensus sequence of this motif for RNA helicases of SF1 is Ala (A)\u2013x\u2013x\u2013Gly (G)\u2013x\u2013Gly (G)\u2013Lys (K)\u2013Thr (T) and for a few DNA helicases, ATPases and GTPases belonging to SF2, this sequence is Gly (G)\u2013x\u2013x\u2013x\u2013x\u2013Gly (G)\u2013Lys (K)\u2013Thr (T) (Gorbalenya et al., 1989). In the classical version of this motif either Gly (G) or Ala (A) is present at first position and in the short version G is present at fourth position of this motif (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1989). It is well established that the last three residues \u2018GKT\u2019 are required for the interaction of the protein with Mg2+ and ATP (Walker et al., 1982). More precisely the amino group of Lys (K) of GKT interacts with the \u03b2 and \u03b3 phosphates of the ATP molecule (Walker et al., 1982). The role of conserved Gly (G) is structural and it helps to maintain the flexible loop conformation (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1989). In a separate study it was shown that the mutation of K of \u2018GKT\u2019 to uncharged amino acid Asn (N) in mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-4A eliminated the binding of ATP to the protein (Pause and Sonenberg, 1992).",

            "text": "This motif is also known as \u2018B\u2019 motif of ATPase or \u2018Walker motif B\u2019 (Walker et al., 1982). The consensus sequence for this motif is Asp (D)\u2013Glu (E)\u2013Ala (A)\u2013Asp (D), therefore the proteins containing this motif are also known as \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 proteins (Linder et al., 1989). Various studies have shown that the first highly conserved residue Asp (D) of this motif interacts with the Mg2+ cation, which is required for NTP binding (Gorbalenya et al., 1989). Mutations in this motif have been shown to affect the ATPase and coupled helicase activities of a number of proteins such as Ded1p, eIF4 A, Dbp8p and a number of other putative helicases (Blum et al., 1992, Pause and Sonenberg, 1992, Iost et al., 1999, Daugeron and Linder, 2001). In yeast eIF-4A the mutation of the first Asp (D) of this motif to a Glu (E) resulted in the inactivation of this protein (Schmid and Linder, 1991). In another study involving mammalian eIF-4A, mutation of second Glu (E) to Gln (Q) severely affected ATP hydrolysis (Pause and Sonenberg, 1992). It has been suggested that this replacement may cause steric hindrance and this may be the reason, which explains the presence of this conserved ATPase B motif in the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 family of helicases and some ATPases (Hodgman, 1988, Schmid and Linder, 1991). These studies also emphasize that negative charges at the first two positions of this motif are required for Mg2+-coordinated ATP hydrolysis. It is interesting to note that there is an enormously extensive range of variation in the distances separating the \u2018Walker A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 motifs. Since the two domains are believed to come together to form the NTP-binding center, this means that large domains can be looped out and allow this interaction.",

The crystallographic structural studies of the amino-terminal domain of yeast eIF-4A reveal specific interactions between amino acid residues of the phosphate binding loop, the DEAD-motif and the SAT motif (Johnson and McKay, 1999). Double mutations in this domain (SAT to AAA) of yeast eIF-4A lead to the loss of RNA helicase activity while the ATP-binding, hydrolysis and RNA binding activities remained intact (Pause and Sonenberg, 1992). The studies using mutants in motif III of yeast Prp22p helicase revealed that this motif is required for coupling of NTPase and helicase activities because these mutants were able to hydrolyze ATP but were defective in unwinding duplex RNA (Schwer and Meszaros, 2000). It has been shown recently that the mutations of the first Ser (S) to Ala (A) and the third Thr (T) to Ala (A) of the yeast \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 protein Has1p partially dissociated ATPase and helicase activities (Rocak et al., 2005). These mutational data collectively suggest the importance of the interactions between the amino acid residues of various domains, which may be responsible for yet unknown mechanism of coupling the NTPase activity with the RNA unwinding. It has also been suggested that the SAT residues might be involved in the transmission of energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to unwind the duplex RNA.",

This motif has been suggested to be involved in interaction with RNA. It has been proposed that this motif is a part of the ATP-binding cleft and is also involved in coupling between helicase and NTPase activities of the protein. In mammalian eIF-4A, it has been shown that mutants having first His (H) changed to Gln (Q) of motif VI had reduced ATP-binding and ATPase activity but no helicase activity (Pause and Sonenberg, 1992). In a recent study it has been shown that the substitution of first His (H) to Glu (E) in motif VI of the yeast DEAD-box protein Has1p significantly decreased helicase but not the ATPase activity and this mutation was lethal in vivo (Rocak et al., 2005). The mutation of last Arg (R) of this motif in hepatitis C virus full-length NS3 protein resulted in loss of both the NTPase and helicase activities (Wardell et al., 1999). Similarly in UL9, the replacement of Arg (R) in this domain with Lys (K) resulted in reduction of the ssDNA-dependent intrinsic ATPase activity and complete elimination of the helicase activity (Marintcheva and Weller, 2001). The studies with DEN-2 NS3 protein with mutation of Arg (R) of this motif to Ala (A) also showed no detectable RNA unwinding activity but it retained the ATPase activity (Matusan et al., 2001). These studies suggest that motif VI mediates ligand-induced conformational changes, which are required for the helicase to move along the nucleic acid substrate. The crystal structure of NS3 has shown that the arginines of this domain make contact with the \u03b1 and \u03b3 phosphates of ATP and facilitate this interaction (Kim et al., 1998).",

The motif V with conserved sequence Arg (R)\u2013Gly (G)\u2013x\u2013Asp (D) is also present in all the members of DEAD-box family in P. falciparum (Fig. 2). It has been suggested that this motif is capable of forming an extended network of interactions (Caruthers and McKay, 2002). Structural studies have shown that motifs V and VI \u201clink\u201d the carboxy-terminal domain to the amino-terminal domain through interactions with ATP and the \u2018DEAD-motif\u2019 providing a mechanism for the coupling of ATP-binding and hydrolysis with conformational changes, which modulate the binding of the nucleic acid substrate (Caruthers et al., 2000, Tuteja et al., 2005). With structural studies of yeast eIF-4A it has been shown that first Arg (R) of this motif could interact with the \u2018DEAD-motif\u2019 and this interaction plays a role in coupling ATP-binding and hydrolysis to RNA binding or it induces a conformational change (Caruthers et al., 2000). In a recent study the first Arg (R) of motif V of human p68 was mutated to Leu (L) and it was observed that both the RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA unwinding activity were abolished in the mutant (Lin et al., 2005). These observations collectively suggest that although the conserved motifs possibly act in synchronization with one another to carry out the basic helicase action, their distinct mechanistic roles might be susceptible to some extent of variation to correspond to the specific function of the particular enzyme.",

These regions are referred to as hydrophilic low complexity regions and are due to the presence of amino acid Asn (N), Lys (K), Glu (E) or Asp (D), which are mainly coded by AT-rich codons (Pizzi and Frontali, 2000, Pizzi and Frontali, 2001). The frequency and presence of these homorepeats are highly variable and they are mainly present in most of the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 helicases of P. falciparum at the N-terminal or C-terminal regions. In some of the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 helicases these homorepeats are also present in between the various conserved domains. It is interesting to note that although a stretch of amino acid Asn (N) is present in between the motif I and Ia in the \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 DNA helicase PfDH60 from P. falciparum it still shows the nucleic acid-dependent ATPase, DNA and RNA helicase and ATP-binding activities (Pradhan et al., 2005a, Pradhan et al., 2005b). Therefore it can be postulated that in most of the proteins the presence of these homorepeats may not have any effect on their biological activity. It has been suggested that these regions encode non-globular domains of unidentified function, which are extruded from the proteins core and therefore have no effect on the functional folding of the protein (Pizzi and Frontali, 2001).",

The crystallographic structure of the amino-terminal domain (residues 1\u2013223) of yeast eIF-4A has been solved (Johnson and McKay, 1999). This structure shows that there are precise interactions between the amino acid residues of the Walker A motif, the \u2018DEAD-motif\u2019 and the SAT motif. On the other hand, the structure of full-length eIF-4A reveals that it is a dumbbell consisting of two compact domains that are connected by an extended linker (Caruthers et al., 2000) (Fig. 3\n). By using the structure of yeast eIF-4A, a model for the structure of eIF-4A homologue of P. falciparum has been created (Fig. 3). As is clear from the modeled structure, the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains are connected via an extended linker. It is also noticeable that motifs V and VI \u2018link\u2019 the carboxy-terminal domain to the amino-terminal domain through interactions with the \u2018DEAD-motif\u2019 and ATP, which provide a means for coupling the ATP-binding and hydrolysis with conformational changes. These results collectively suggest that there might be minor variations in the length and sequence between the conserved domains but overall for the enzyme action all the domains are clustered and act in co-ordination with each other (Fig. 3).",

Hence, the compounds, which can inhibit any of these steps, can act as potential inhibitors. The compounds, which can bind at the nucleic acid binding pocket of the helicase, can also inhibit the reaction by preventing the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate or cause a block for the movement of the enzyme on the substrate. These compounds may inhibit the reaction either by interfering with ATP-binding, inhibiting nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity or by uncoupling the ATP-hydrolysis-dependent unwinding reaction. The compounds, which diminish the accessibility of ATP for ATP-binding site, can also be considered as significant inhibitors of helicase and potential anti-malarial agents. A number of previous studies including ours have shown that the DNA-interacting agents are well-known anti-helicase agents and these act at the level of the substrate (Tuteja et al., 1997, Tuteja et al., 2003, Borowski et al., 2002).

            "text": "DNA helicases have been shown to be associated with a number of human genetic diseases and RNA helicases are required for growth and proliferation of bacteria and viruses. Hence these enzymes are excellent targets for antibacterial and antiviral drugs. Studies in the past have shown that the inhibitors of the herpes simplex virus helicase-primase have potent anti-herpes activity and recently some other viral helicases have emerged as novel targets for the treatment of viral infections (Kleymann et al., 2002, Kwong et al., 2005). It has also been suggested that these important enzymes can be used as targets for anti-cancer drugs (Sharma et al., 2005). The studies with PfDH60 (a \u2018DEAD-box\u2019 helicase from P. falciparum) have shown that DNA-binding compounds can inhibit its unwinding and ATPase activities (Tuteja and Pradhan, unpublished observation). The detailed studies including cloning and characterization of helicases of malaria parasite P. falciparum may help to identify a specific enzyme, which is inhibited by a compound that has no effect on the enzymes of the host and consequently could be used as the potential drug to treat malaria. These studies should also make a significant contribution to our better understanding of the nucleic acid transaction in the parasite.",
