Universal and equitable access to water, sanitation, and hygiene is a critical public health issue and the focus of Sustainable Development Goal 6. However, over 50% of the global population lacks access to adequate sanitation, and 75% of households in low-income and middle-income countries are unable to wash with soap and water.1 Despite its importance, water infrastructure is substantially underfunded, particularly in informal settings such as slums, rural areas, and refugee camps, where access to adequate water is deteriorating due to accelerating climate change. Without access to safe water, COVID-19 could to disproportionately affect individuals living in these settings",

Climate change contributed to multiple unprecedented severe weather events in 2019, placing substantial so-called water stress on affected regions, including widespread flooding in southeast Asia, the driest year on record in Australia, and Cyclone Idai on Africa's east coast, in addition to extended periods of significantly reduced rainfall in sub-Saharan Africa and central America.3 800 million people must travel over 30 min to access safe water,4 many of whom reside in informal settings, and have additional risk from COVID-19 due to overcrowded living conditions that promote disease transmission.",
