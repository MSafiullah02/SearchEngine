In the majority of documented COVID-19 cases, the initial chest CT is abnormal, even in some patients without any evident symptoms. Follow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset. Cardiac involvement and arrhythmic complications in COVID-19-positive patients have been described [8\u201310].",

Taking projections for Spain as example, around April 18 COVID-19-related demand for healthcare resources will first drop below the availability baseline, resulting in a positive margin with a stable reserve around April 26, which could be considered by healthcare administrators as possible date for re-implementation of elective procedures. As availability of resources and strain on the healthcare system may vary significantly between regions or even between different healthcare structures locally due to some areas being more affected than, the local conditions prevail and may resume in staged reimplementation of elective surgery throughout one country or nation. The American College of Surgeons recommends using local prevalence and incidence rates and to consider a decrease in measures of COVID-19 incidence for at least 14 days before transitioning to provide surgical services for patients without immediately life- or limb-threatening conditions [24, 25].",

To avoid this, the use of dexmedetomidine and lidocaine is recommended. For extubation after EI, a sterile drape can be placed over the anesthetist and the patient to reduce contamination through aerosolization during extubation; in sedation, the use of surgical masks is essential for avoiding viral dispersion. Furthermore, the reversal of neuromuscular blocks using pharmacological antagonists as sugammadex is recommended. The use of neostigmine must be avoided due to the risk of increasing the secretion [45, 60, 69, 72, 75, 77].",

Another testing concern is the variability of viral loads in COVID-19 patients, leading to false-negative antigen detection due to low viral load or sampling variability [96].

These tests usually use whole blood, plasma or serum samples from patients. The test relies on a plate that is coated with a viral protein of interest, such as the spike protein. Patient samples are then incubated with the protein, and if the patient has developed COVID-19-specific antibodies (IgG and IgM), they bind together. The bound antibody\u2013protein complex can then be detected with another wash of antibodies that produce a color or fluorescent-based readout.

Neutralization assays are used to prove if a patient has antibodies that are active and effective against a given virus, even if the patient has already passed the infection. These tests require whole blood, serum or plasma samples from the patient. Neutralization assays depend on cell culture, a laboratory-based method of culturing cells that allow SARS-CoV-2 growth. Virus and cells are cultivated with decreasing concentrations of antibodies to quantify how many antibodies in the patient serum are able to block virus replication. This assay is more important for understanding how antibody tests can be qualified and quantified, and only plays a minor role in the pre-op preparation of patients. Validation and improving sensitivity and specificity of antibody assays are important to limit cross-reactivity. Similar protein structures to other coronaviruses are responsible for this and can lead to false-positive results [90, 97]. These are then further tested and improved with the neutralization tests [98].",

IgM antibody can be detected as early as day 3 in many infections. Seroconversion (detectable antibodies) in a patient cohort in Germany with mild COVID-19 symptoms occurred in half of all patients by day 7, and in all by day 14 [84]. An Italian paper showed that serological rapid tests are not useful for diagnosing COVID-19 in the acute setting [29], when the RT-PCR is more useful. Other studies showed that IgM is detectable in samples from 10 to 30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while IgG can be detected from 20 days onward [89]. The IgM response occurs earlier than that of IgG, but then decreases and disappears. While IgG can persist after passed infection for a long time, their protective role in case SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation [88]. Although it appears that recovered COVID-19 patients have antibodies for at least 2 weeks, long-term data are still missing, and it is suggested that antibodies might be present in the blood sample for many months to years. Figure 4 shows this response schematically. More results from current and future studies need to be evaluated in order to improve the accuracy of the diagram shown in relation to COVID-19.",
