The former, inference-based analysis thereby actually encompasses also evolutionary questions, as most of the biologic systems we try to understand and describe are remarkably robust despite stochasticity being present, if not integral part of the mechanisms at multiple levels.

The problem, however, is particularly hard in biology, as the integration has to be bi- rather than unidirectional. Consider a dune, thus a physical object\u2014the dune\u2019s physical properties depend entirely on the physical properties of the sand-corn. Using renormalization techniques, it is possible to mathematically describe a dune and investigate its properties under changing conditions (wind, humidity), without considering each sand-corn individually with simple equations such as the original Bagnold formula (Bagnold 1936). In biology, the physical properties of the molecular assembly such as a chromatin fiber will not only depend on the physical properties of the histones and the DNA, but in addition the histones and thus their the physicochemical properties have evolved under selective pressure acting on the chromatin fiber and its function (Benecke 2003, 2006; B\u00e9cavin et al. 2010). This symmetry established by the retrograde action of evolution is something which currently can not be captured by techniques such as renormalization (Lesne 1998, 2011), but will need to be accounted for in multiscale integration efforts. We have defined the term function-dependent self-scaling for models which describe for instance chromatin structure as a function of activity at the scale relevant to this activity (Lavelle and Benecke 2006).",

There are a few other problems of similar fundamental nature such as the role of stochasticity in biologic mechanisms and how robustness of these mechanisms across changing environmental and systems-internal conditions can be maintained (Kaern et al. 2005). Interestingly, stochasticity here might be a solution more than a problem in many respects, but again a formal framework to describe, quantify, and predict such mechanisms is lacking. In what will follow, we will discuss some recent insights into functional genome representations to add a novel layer of investigation to the problem of gene expression regulation, chromatin structural dynamics, and genome structure\u2013function relationships. These representations are thought to be particularly useful to compare genomes from closely related species and more importantly to provide new ideas of how to treat the case of two or more genomes operating together in a single cell such as is the case in infectious settings (Aderem et al. 2011; Tisoncik et al. 2009). To this end, we will first discuss two recent examples of successful network structure inference and dynamics analysis in systems virology, analyze the implications these results have for our thinking of genome function, and finally provide some ideas how to further investigate these systems using functional genome representations as a first step for a multiscale modeling effort.",

Different hypotheses have been put forward, some of which can be disregarded or are unlikely to provide conclusive answers. SIV natural hosts do not display significantly altered infection or viral amplification rates and viral set-point titers. Moreover, chronically infected natural hosts maintain comparably high viral titers and can propagate virus. Viral particles isolated from natural hosts can be used to infect other animals (Jacquelin et al. 2009; Bosinger et al. 2009; Favre et al. 2009; Lederer et al. 2009; Estes et al. 2008).

Currently, a specific search is underway in the different time resolved transcriptome profiles to identify such activators or repressors of either immune attenuation or IA, and which are differentially expressed/regulated in progressors and non-progressors. It will be of general, beyond the HIV field, interest to identify and characterize such activators and repressors which can promote or control chronic IA with obvious impacts for organ transplantation and autoimmune disorders (Rotger et al. 2011; Bosinger et al. 2011; Harris et al. 2010; Ye and Maniatis 2011; Lepelley et al. 2011).\n",

Thus, a dedicated signaling cascade composed of at least a sensor for a specific attenuation/activation signal, a transcriptional regulator, and a relay unit linking the sensor to the effector. Not only the molecules that are required specifically in either class of species, but also the nature of the specific signal pose a challenge in terms of evolution as an entire signaling pathway is required. Recall also that the signal for instance does not likely originate from the virus. Facing these dilemmas, we have recently formulated an alternate hypothesis for the absence of chronic IA in natural hosts which is based on a dynamic interpretation of the earliest innate sensing events following viral infection (Benecke et al. 2012). For the time being, this hypothesis is only modestly carried by direct experimental observations, as the time resolution with which early signaling events are usually studied is at least an order of magnitude above what would be required to directly assess the merits of the proposition. On the other hand, if this hypothesis, which appeals through its simplicity, would turn out to lead to the identification of a novel mechanism controlling long-term IA through early events, it would also define novel possible avenues for HIV vaccine development.",

            "text": "Kinetic proofreading is a potent mechanism known in molecular discrimination (Hopfield 1974). Kinetic proofreading is a process in which, through expenditure of additional energy, ligand recognition is split into two or more individual events in order to increase specificity and discriminatory capacity between closely related ligands or interaction partners with modestly different free energies of binding. In a first step, usually coupled to a conformational change in the receptor achieved through the hydrolysis of ATP, a candidate ligand is bound and presented to an independent interaction surface. Only if this second, independent interaction occurs rapidly enough, the recognition is conclusive, otherwise the ligand is released as the receptor snaps back into its original conformation. This mechanism has been studied in great detail theoretically and shown to drastically increase recognition of a bonafide ligand over analog molecules with very similar free energies. The error thereby is reduced beyond the thermodynamic bound\u2014sometimes referred to as the specificity paradox upon which Hopfield based his predictions that ribosomes match codons and amino-acid-loaded tRNA anticodons using a kinetic proofreading mechanism. This has later been proved experimentally also for the way that aminoacyl tRNA synthetase operates (Hopfield 1974; Hopfield et al. 1976). Furthermore, and more relevant to this discussion, T-cell receptors use kinetic proofreading to enhance discrimination of bonafide ligands from closely related molecules to ensure correct signaling (McKeithan 1995). Finally, some evidence suggests that kinetic proofreading could also be found at the basis of RIG-I or TLR mediated recognition of foreign in innate immunity (Loo and Gale 2011; Liu and Gale 2010; Suthar et al. 2010).",

In this scenario, some of the mechanisms of innate immunity would be required to be activated in order to maintain sustained, general IA beyond acute infection. Absence of innate proofreading would then lead to total inactivation of immune function. However, also the exact opposite effect might be at work\u2014innate proofreading is required to attenuate continued IA. We believe that this latter scenario is more likely, and better reflects the general observations made about immunity. A typical pathogen will trigger (many) different innate sensors simultaneously. The multitude of signals acts synergistically to mount the immediate innate IA which in turns triggers adaptive immunity. Maintaining this early response over prolonged periods of time, as observed in AIDS progressors, does not add any advantage to the system, however, is costly in terms of energy expenditure and precludes specific activation of downstream processes. If one of the different innate sensing mechanisms serves as proofreading mechanism, it makes more sense to propose that the proofreading is meant to attenuate the early innate response rather than sustaining or driving it as the latter would be redundant with the other mechanisms. In other words, the proofreading would simply signal that innate IA has been successfully triggered and thus needs to be attenuated in the near future in order to set the stage for adaptive immunity, avoid exhaustion of resources, and redundant signaling without added benefit.",

In this context, the time delay creates a lag-time for the attenuation signal of innate activation which would prevent early shutdown. In other words, not relying on a specific signaling pathway for attenuation creates the problem that innate IA and its attenuation are triggered at the same time leading to conflicting signals. If, however, the attenuation signal is lagging behind because of its increased specificity, a functional feedforward repression is implemented (Benecke et al. 2012).",

Note that, we assume here that the lower bound is defined by the first encounter with viral particles/components thereof or immediately after, thus is identical for the two species in this experiment, and that the upper bound is a function of the intrinsic lifetime of prerecognition complexes assumed to be identical in both cases as well. Thus, the only variable in the system is the speed with which IA occurs in both species. This can be viewed as analog to the situation of a surfer. If pathogen encounter and innate recognition as foreign is considered a wave at the beach, then IA could be seen as a surfer getting up on his surfboard. If the surfer fails to mount during the window of opportunity (defined by the width of the wave-back, thus intrinsic to the wave), the surfer will sink; thus, the term west coast model used (see Benecke et al. 2012 for a detailed discussion on this argument). Relevance of this model stems from the following observations: SIV-infected NHPs and HIV-infected human AIDS progressors mount their innate immune response too slow or rather too late leading to a non-attenuation and thus chronic IA. This unresolved innate IA wears down the system and leads consequently to decline in CD4+ T-cells, the hallmark of AIDS (Pandrea et al. 2011). Natural hosts for SIV on the other hand, such as sooty mangabeys, African green monkeys, and mandrills display timely responses to infection leading to successful IA and concomitant IA attenuation and, due to absence of specific humoral responses long-term tolerance of the virus (Jacquelin et al. 2009; Bosinger et al. 2009; Favre et al. 2009; Lederer et al. 2009; Rotger et al. 2011).",

Still, it seems unlikely that such before mentioned effects would entail such profound changes in the IA kinetics, and thus this experimental finding might be regarded as a potential support of the proposition of kinetic autoattenuation of IA in natural hosts. It will be of outmost interest to better characterize the activation dynamics across the entire spectrum of known natural hosts and progressors in order to contrast possible differences in the activation kinetics with human subjects (or more likely ex vivo cellular models) representing the different observed classes [progressor, long-term non-progressor (LTNP), elite controller (EC)] as especially the LTNPs would be candidates of having acquired a similar attenuation mechanism as natural hosts. In this context, particular attention should also be given to the investigation of co-infection schemes with different pathogens (Schreiber et al. 2011).

This might sound simpler than it indeed is for several reasons such as experimental limitations imposed by the model systems or the technologies at hand for monitoring molecular events and their proxies (mRNA, signal cascade activation, metabolic activity), but mainly as one will need to overcome the problem of integration over multiple scales from the dynamics of single molecular events (in the micro- to millisecond range) to events at the organ level occurring on the scale of hours to days (please refer to the remarks made in Sect. 1).

The compendium of microarray data from the 12 analyzed studies was composed of a total of 733 individual transcriptome profiles, roughly equally distributed over the three physiopathological groups (\u2018high\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019, and \u2018low\u2019 pathogenicity) and their corresponding controls. Four different methods of meta-analysis stemming from two different philosophical approaches were used and compared in their absolute and relative performance. Processed data were either converted to logratios to identify genes that show opposite regulation in HPI and LPI, or directly submitted to meta-analysis by direct comparisons. In previous studies, both targeted and genome-wide approaches have been used to identify particular host pathways deregulated during infection. In parallel, a direct comparison of gene expression in \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 pathogenicity groups was performed. Statistically significantly differentially expressed genes were compiled to result in a characteristic gene signature when comparing the initial \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 groups. The fundamental difference between the three earlier, logratio based methods, and the latter direct comparison signature is the implicit choice of reference gene expression levels as well as the subsequent classifier used to choose signature genes. While the former methods will select for those genes that are uniquely/oppositely regulated in \u2018high\u2019 versus \u2018low\u2019 pathogenicity settings, the latter will select for genes that are statistically significantly differentially expressed between both conditions. The logratio meta-analysis derived signatures could be, in accordance with Sonnenschein et al. (2011), referred to as \u2018digital\u2019 and the direct comparison signature which comprises both gene IDs and gene expression values as \u2018analog\u2019. All of the pathogenicity signatures were then compared among each other and characterized individually toward the objective to characterize responses that were present across high-pathogenic infections (HPI) and low-pathogenic infections (LPI).",

In-depth analysis of the aPS revealed, furthermore, that biologic conditions classified as intermediate between HPI and LPI often belonged in the case of MPI data to late time points after infection, and for HPI data to early time points, leading to an analog immune response model for respiratory virus infection. The aPS derived by comparative meta-analysis of this respiratory virus infection compendium can be, thus, used to correctly classify host transcriptome responses according to clinical pathogenicity. The reason why the aPS outperforms the alternate digital pathogenicity signatures derived through the other three meta-analysis methods is explained by the striking observation of an analog that is continuous and correlated, host gene expression response to pathogenicity. Gene expression of this continuos response can be either positively or negatively correlated with pathogenicity, the latter being only recently recognized to exist (Kash et al. 1918; Cilloniz et al. 2010). This finding has not only technical implications for molecular signature definition strategies, but also for the understanding of the physiopathology of respiratory virus infection: continuous responses of gene networks to pathogenicity rather than different or oppositely regulated networks specific to \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 pathogenicity dominate the immunologic response of the host to viral infection which has major implications for medical targeting of these networks. On the other hand, the observation of analog immune responses lends hope to the successful identification and boosting of host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms against high pathogenicity infections.",

The large number of different biologic conditions will not be exploitable and the space of biologic conditions hence will remain extremely sparsely sampled. Furthermore, it will almost nowhere reach sufficient density (e.g. recordings of many independent biologic replicates) to allow proper statistics. Moreover, simultaneous observation of all relevant determinants at all relevant scales over time is not possible, the experimental data will remain independent observations. Statistics on those will not enable to construct causal links rather than correlations between them. Furthermore, standard statistics is inappropriate for the questions posed since biologic processes are not generic, and arguments of parsimony, typicality, and natural chance of occurrence fail. Finally, statistical descriptions per se do not provide causal relationships, and hence do not provide comprehension of the underlying mechanisms.

            "text": "In order to go beyond statistical approaches and, thus, to reach a level of understanding of genomes which is sufficient for meaningful inference of regulatory processes the current concept of a letter-based alphabet for genome coding needs to be revisited. Comprehension, or at least the possibility of inference of networks and their dynamics over multiple scales is likely a prerequisite to targeting multifactorial diseases such as cancer, genetic disorders, or pathogen-induced malignancies. The examples discussed above illustrate well the limitations of current methodologies at hand. Let us, thus, first recapitulate the main features which need to be captured by mathematical (or functional) genome representation: a genome (i) codes for a number of molecular machines that catalyze elementary biochemical reactions, and (ii) has evolved to orchestrate the molecular machines in a manner that whatever form the organism takes in response to external or internal stimuli the organism remains alive (Benecke 2006). This seemingly trivial concept that any transitions from one functional (active) form of the genome/organism to another can only happen at the condition that any intermediate represents a viable genome/organism needs to be exploited as it is the strongest constraint on the system. The true \u2018miracle\u2019 does not lie within the elementary machines but within the fact that they self-organize across different time and space scales into a functional form whether it be at an embryonic or an adult state (Smet-Nocca et al. 2010). It is the rules of interaction (direct or indirect) that are at the essence of the genome. These rules of interaction are coded in the genome at its sequence level, but also on the level of its structural and spatial dynamics (for instance: activity-dependent subnuclear localization, or localization-dependent activity). Thereby, any elementary information in the genome (such as a single nucleotide) has a role (even seemingly negligible) of coding for any part of the functional forms of the genome at different time and space scales (Benecke 2006). The functional forms of a genome are thus expressed through nonzero contributions (weights) from individual elements which interact within a highly constrained, hence rigid structure. Note that from a computational viewpoint, an active genome is presumably a universal Turing machine (Benecke 2006). Recently, an initial proposition for a mathematical representation has been made where nucleotide frequencies as well as measurements on the activity of any part of the genome under defined biologic conditions are simultaneously expressed as probability distributions (Lesne and Benecke 2008a, b). This mathematical structure allows, which yet also has some questionable properties, see below, allows to introduce concepts from algebraic geometry for data analysis and modeling. We thereby use three independent paradigm shifts which lead to a modified approach to the inference problem in functional genomics (Benecke 2008).",

In the toy example given in Fig. 4, one might for instance want to ask whether it is necessary to consider the activity profiles of Virus~1 and Virus~2 as distinct or whether it is more meaningful to pool them. In other words, does the profile of Virus~1 when jointly considered with the one of Virus~2 provide independent information which needs to be considered or can the one be used to rather back the other? To answer, a measure called Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (Kullback and Leibler 1951) can be employed to measure the relative contribution of either activity profile to the joint profile. Each individual profile\u2019s weight to the combined measure is obtained using the average presumed frequency of these subsets (rather subpopulations). This amounts to one example of a vertical comparison which can be performed along the genome. Then, a longitudinal integration of the local divergencies is performed along genome regions of relevance (e.g. over the location associated to a given gene) allowing to analyze the feature divergence profile of a biologic condition over the entire genome or defined intervals. This genome-wide distance measure is meaningful, unlike the individual feature profiles. If the conditioning by any combination of individual or averaged profiles leads to a statistically significant divergence (suggesting that the associated subpopulation is well delineated and has a specific signature) the profile is kept as a separate entity. In contrast, if statistical significance is not reached, the condition is considered non-pertinent to the biologic question posed as it does not provide a measurable constraint on the value of the joint profile and can be combined with any other statistically insignificant conditions. This process, thus, integrates and thereby collapses part of the landscape to restrict to statistically divergent information (whether this is also biologic meaningful information can not be determined at this stage). Two advantages arise in this case: (i) the complexity of the structure is reduced in a controlled manner in so far as it is irrelevant to the biologic question investigated, and (ii) the statistical power of the joint probability profile is increased. As shown in Lesne and Benecke (2008b), this procedure can be performed at any interesting scale or functional level and thus the probability landscape over the genomic sequence can be reduced in complexity until all remaining context-dependencies reach statistical significance at which an optimum for computational complexity and statistical power is reached. Different biologic conditions can thereby be defined with maximum flexibility using separate or overlapping subsets of subconditions in a hierarchical manner. The Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence-based method discussed in Lesne and Benecke (2008b) represents, thus, a systematic and simple way of testing the statistical limits of complexity reduction and hence explanatory power of the integrative genomics data in their respective contexts. Note that since we are comparing the distributions of the same random variable under different conditions, it is only the distance (or divergence) between the two distributions that is meaningful. A joint probability, such as mutual information, could not be envisioned. This also holds for the case of two different variables because the joint probability distribution is inaccessible. From a general perspective, our method represents an application of concepts related to context trees to the probability landscape idea. Context analysis and landscape collapse thereby operate in similar manners to Markov chains with variable length for the analysis of time-series and historic context (B\u00fchlmann and Wyner 1999; Maubourguet et al. 2008). We also note that the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence calculation provides measures that can be used directly for clustering of probability profiles. Clustering of probability profiles might help to establish and analyze relatedness among data otherwise not compared directly.",

As discussed above, probability density distributions are at the basis of the P-profiles generated from the to-be-annotated data. While so far only symmetric distributions have been described and studied (Lesne and Benecke 2008a, b), the formalism does not exclude the use of skewed, nontrivial distributions (Fig. 5).

Again, a number of different ways to achieve such integration have been proposed (Selinger 2012). Indeed, in the example of the respiratory virus infection (Sect. 3), the proposed integration mechanism provides a means of discerning which one is the more likely of the two possible mechanisms, and thus prioritize the experimentally testable hypotheses.\n",
