As of March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected a total of 80,422 people in China, with a mortality rate of 3.71%. More than 12,000 people were diagnosed outside China, showing a global pandemic trend. At present, the treatment of COVID-19 has become a research hotspot. However, relevant information about clinical characteristics, treatment options, prognosis of chronic renal failure patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 has not been reported. Two COVID-19 patients with chronic renal failure in Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology were retrospectively analysed.",

In addition, comorbidities such as diabetes, heart failure and acute renal failure indicate poor prognosis6. According to the research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, human coronavirus can replicate to a high titer at early stage. This high replication may lead to enhanced cytopathic effects and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by infected epithelial cells. These cytokines, in turn, induce large numbers of inflammatory cells penetrating into the lung[7], [8], [9], [10]. Disrupting the antiviral response by antagonizing IFN can achieve innate immune delay or immune evasion[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Excessive release of inflammatory cytokines and the formation of a series of self-amplifying cytokines activate a cascade of reactions, causing damage to diffuse alveolar, transparent membranes formation and fibrotic protein exudation. In severe cases, cytokine storm can induce hemodynamic instability, DIC, and multiple organ dysfunction. Increased levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and other inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients are related to poor prognosis[15]. This is consistent with the phenomenon that two cases suffered from multiple organ dysfunction, with serum cytokines significantly increased.",

Although glucocorticoids can inhibit the excessive activation of inflammatory factors, large doses of glucocorticoids will delay the elimination of new coronavirus due to immunosuppressive effects[16]. Compared with other COVID-19 patients, these 2 cases receive continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, every other day for 4-6 hours due to chronic renal failure. CVVHDF is suitable for patients with acute and chronic renal failure, especially those with the following conditions: Routine dialysis is prone to hypotension, refractory hypertension, excessive body fluids and heart failure that conventional hemodialysis cannot control, severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, uremia neuropathy, unstable cardiovascular function, and multiple organ failure. Moreover, blood purification can be applied more widely, such as persistent inflammatory fever, acute respiratory distress syndrome, volume overload, combined with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, et al[17]. Both patients met the above indications. CVVHDF can remove small and medium molecules such as chemical toxins, endotoxins, bilirubin, urea nitrogen, creatinine, cytokines, inflammatory factors and water. Thus the reduction of excessive cytokine may relieve cytokine storm and multi-organ function failure for COVID-19 patient. So it is speculated that blood purification technology can protect COVID-19 patients from severe pneumonia via cytokine purification and organ function support. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with over-activated inflammatory reactions may benefit from blood purification, such as plasma exchange, adsorption, perfusion, and blood/plasma filtration if available, with or without renal failure. These speculations require more clinical trials to verify.",
