She was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) with normal spontaneous breathing, Spo 2 of 96%, and bilateral hemostatic nasal packing. About 30 minutes after arrival in the PACU, while the patient was awake and alert, she complained of trouble breathing. She was tachypneic, with Spo 2 of 84. The auscultation of lung was unremarkable. There was no evidence of upper respiratory obstruction or pulmonary edema. She promptly received oxygen with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and dexamethasone 8 mg. Due to the recent surgery, however, the mask was placed only over her mouth. The Spo 2 increased, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit while she was still on BiPAP. As the cause of her hypoxemic event was still unclear, a chest computed tomography (CT) was ordered. Surprisingly, imaging revealed bilateral multilobar cases-anesthesia-analgesia.org a & a pRaCtICe patchy opacities predominantly in the posterior and peripheral regions, consistent with previously described radiologic features of COVID-19 (Figure) . A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of a pharyngeal specimen confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.

She was isolated at home and daily monitored for 2 weeks after discharge, and the follow-up was unremarkable.",
