            "text": "Depending on the strain used, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes a variety of diseases, such as enteritis, hepatitis and demyelinating encephalomyelitis, in susceptible rodents [1]. Infection of susceptible strains of mice with strain MHV-3 results in severe hepatitis caused, in part, by overexpression of prothrombinase [2]. This infection may serve as a useful model for acute, fulminant hepatitis in humans [3]. Infection of immunocompetent mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of MHV results in acute encephalitis, followed, variably, by the development of chronic demyelination in survivors. Virus is not cleared from the central nervous system (CNS), effectively resulting in a persistent infection, although infectious virus is only recovered from chronically infected mice in some models. Viral RNA is readily detected in the CNSs of these mice [4] and, more recently, virus-specific CD8+ T cells were also recovered from the CNSs of chronically infected mice at more than 60 days post infection (pi) [5]. Several characteristics of the CNS foster its predisposition to persistent viral infection, such as low-to-undetectable expression of MHC classes I and II molecules on oligodendrocytes, neurons and astrocytes, limited immune surveillance, and low apoptotic rate of CNS cells [6].",

CD8+ T cells are critical for virus clearance and, as described below, are able to induce demyelination. During persistence, CD8+ T cells lose cytolytic activity [14\u2022\u2022]. CD8+ T cells that remain in the CNS at 35\u201345 days p.i. are still able to secrete interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) when specifically stimulated, showing that they have not completely lost effector function [14\u2022\u2022], as has been described in mice persistently infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [17]. IFN-\u03b3 appears to be critical for controlling viral replication, particularly in oligodendrocytes [18].

In this model system, activated CD8+ T cells are maintained in the CNS in the absence of influenza virus or viral antigens [20].

However, a significant fraction of these mice later develops demyelinating encephalomyelitis.

This effect is probably mediated by RANTES, as CD4+ T cells are an important source of this chemokine [23]. Furthermore, fewer MHV-specific CD4+ T cells are present in the CNSs of chronically infected mice when assayed by IFN-\u03b3 secretion [16\u2022].

Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from syngeneic (genetically identical) immunocompetent mice into infected SCID or RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in rapid development of demyelination within seven to nine days post transfer (p.t.). Demyelination occurs with transfer of splenocytes that have been depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, but not of both cell types, demonstrating that T cells are necessary for demyelination to develop. Additional experiments indicated that either T cell subset (CD4+ or CD8+) is capable of initiating this process. Mice that receive splenocytes depleted of CD4+ T cells survive longer and develop more demyelination than do mice that receive splenocytes depleted of CD8+ T cells, indicating that the roles of each T cell subset in this disease process are not identical [25\u2022\u2022].",

Indeed, this is evident even among strain variants derived from strain JHM, some of which display pathogenic profiles distinct from those described in the previous section. It is therefore clear that the study of pathogenic mechanisms of MHV infection can be furthered through creation of defined strain chimeras and site-directed mutants. Recent developments in the manipulation of large coronavirus RNA genomes have now allowed for creation of these defined mutants. These viruses are being used in rodent infection models to understand the viral genetic basis of pathogenicity. The sheer size of the MHV genome (32 kb) has hindered the development of an infectious cDNA clone. A recently developed technique uses the high level of RNA recombination observed in MHV-infected cells to introduce mutations or new genetic sequences into MHV [34\u2022] (Fig. 1\n). A modified synthetic transcript encoding sequences from the 3\u2032 end of the MHV genome is introduced via electroporation into cells already infected with a parent virus. These transcripts contain desired mutations as well as selectable \u2018marker\u2019 mutations that, when fixed into recombinant MHV genomes, will confer growth advantages under certain experimental conditions. Recombinant viruses containing desired mutations are therefore selected by virtue of heat resistance or altered cell tropism 34\u2022., 35\u2022\u2022..",

The cellular receptor for MHV is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family of cell adhesion molecules (murine CEACAM1a). Controversy remains as to whether this is the primary receptor in the CNS 36., 37.. Viral attachment is mediated by the surface (S) glycoprotein, which is cleaved into two fragments in many strains of MHV. S1 mediates binding to infected cells and S2 is critical for virus\u2013cell fusion. Previous results, using natural and antibody-selected variants of MHV, showed that variations in the S protein had a dramatic effect on pathogenesis. It has recently been suggested that some of the differences in pathogenesis reflect instability of S1\u2013S2 complexes. Increased stability of the complex correlates with increased growth in tissue culture cells [38]. Viruses with increased stability of the S1\u2013S2 complex are less neurovirulent than the parental strain, suggesting that a more labile interaction may enhance viral entry in the infected murine host.",

Introduction of the S gene of the highly neurovirulent strain JHM into the mildly neurovirulent strain MHV A59 resulted in a substantial increase in neurovirulence, paralleling that of the JHM parental strain [39]. In another study, the S gene of strain A59 was replaced with the S gene from MHV-2, a nondemyelinating virus that causes hepatitis. The resulting virus caused severe hepatitis, but not demyelination, although, unlike the strain MHV-2 parental strain, it was able to persist in the spinal cord [40]. Targeted recombination was also used to illustrate a critical role for the S protein of another coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), in cellular tropism and pathogenesis [41]. These studies together confirm that the S protein has a critical role in coronavirus pathogenesis. More recently, infectious cDNA clones have been developed for several coronaviruses 42\u2022., 43\u2022.. The development of full-length infectious clones provides obvious advantages, including the ability to introduce mutations into genes at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, elimination of the necessary selection process and increased ability to identify lethal mutations [34\u2022]. However, given the size of the genome, targeted recombination may remain the method of choice for manipulation of the 3\u2032 end of the genome.",

In the example shown in this figure, a recombinant virus is produced whose gene 3 (S gene) differs from that of the parental virus. Exchange of the S gene permits tissue culture selection of recombinant viruses by altering host-cell specificity. Recombinant viruses may also have unique pathogenic profiles, as described in the text. (a) Initially, a plasmid was constructed that contains the murine Sgene (shaded gene3). The plasmid could contain either a mutation in any of the MHV genes present in the plasmid or a new sequence to be introduced into the MHV genome, and flanking sequences from MHV. (b) An RNA copy of the MHV sequence within the plasmid was generated in vitro. (c)The in vitro-generated transcript containing the murine S gene was electroporated into feline cells. These cells were previously infected with a chimeric MHV that expressed the S protein from feline infectious peritonitis virus (unshaded gene 3, termed fMHV for feline MHV). This virus has the ability to infect feline cells and not murine cells. Recombination takes place (as indicated by the right to left arrow) between the fMHV RNA genome and the generated transcript containing the murine S gene. As a result, replication-competent viruses will be produced that have exchanged the fMHV S gene for the murine S gene (indicated by the downward arrow).
