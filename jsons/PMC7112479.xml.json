The past decade has witnessed a great deal of\neffort in understanding the dynamical process of epidemic spreading on complex\nnetworks.1\u201310\nIn most early theoretical models, the propagation of virus from one node to another is\ntacitly assumed to be a reaction process, that is, an infected node can affect any of the\nnodes in its neighborhood with a fixed probability at each time step. This picture, however,\nmay be idealized. In many real-world situations, even when there is a link connecting two\nneighboring nodes, propagation of infection will not occur unless there is a kind of traffic\ndynamics on the network that can physically transport the virus from one node to another.\nFor example, a computer virus can spread over the Internet but only through some\ntransportation process such as email exchanges. Without such a physical process of data\ntransmission, even if there is a path linking two computers, the virus will not propagate\nfrom one computer to another. Potentially fast spreading of infectious diseases among\ndifferent regions is another example, which can be accelerated tremendously by air travel.\nTo gain a more complete and physical understanding of the dynamical process of epidemic\nspreading on complex networks, some sort of underlying traffic dynamics must be taken into\naccount.",

The probability that the epidemic\nspreads from infected to susceptible nodes depends on the traffic flow. A susceptible node\nis more likely to be infected if it receives more packets from infected neighbors. Their\nmain result was that the epidemic threshold tends to decrease as the traffic flow is\nintensified. Subsequently, the issue was investigated of how local-routing-based traffic\ndynamics affects epidemic spreading,13\nwith the finding that the spreading dynamics can be suppressed by routing control in the\nsense that the epidemic threshold can be maximized by optimizing some key parameter\ncharacterizing the routing process. In these works, the quantity of interest was the final\nscope of the epidemics in terms of, for instance, the asymptotic fraction of the infected\nnodes in the equilibrium state. To our knowledge, the important issue of how long it takes\nfor epidemic outbreak to occur in traffic-driven spreading dynamics has not been\nconsidered.",

We define the density of infected nodes of\ndegree k as ik(t)=Ik(t)/Nk,\nwhere Nk\nand Ik(t) are the numbers of nodes and of\ninfected nodes within each degree class k, respectively. According to the\nheterogeneous mean-field theory,2,11,22 we can write the reaction-rate equation for the epidemic\ndynamics as dik(t)dt=\u03b2\u03bbNbalgk[1\u2212ik(t)]\u0398(t),(1)where\nthe right-hand side takes into account the probability that a node with k\nlinks belongs to the susceptible class represented by [1-ik(t)] and can become infected via\npackets traveling from the infected nodes. The latter process is determined by the spreading\nprobability \u03b2, the number of packets\n\u03bbNbalgk\nthat a node of degree k receives at each time step, and the probability\n\u0398(t) that a packet travels through a link\npointing to an infected node. In the case of uncorrelated networks,\n\u0398(t) is independent of the degree and is\ngiven by11\n\u0398(t)=\u2211kbalgkP(k)ik(t)\u2211kbalgkP(k),(2)where\nbalgk\nis the algorithmic betweenness,23 which\ndenotes the number of packets passing through a node for a given routing protocol and\npacket-generation rate \u03bb=1/N.\nIn the case of shortest-path routing, the algorithmic betweenness is equal to the\ntopological betweenness. In the initial spreading stage, terms of order\nO(i2) can be ignored so\nthat Eq. (1) can be simplified as\ndik(t)dt=\u03b2\u03bbNbalgk\u0398(t).(3)Substituting\nEq. (2) into Eq. (3), we obtain d\u0398(t)dt=\u03b2\u03bbN\u3008balg2\u3009\u0398(t)\u3008balg\u3009,(4)where\n\u3008balg\u3009=\u2211kbalgkP(k) and \u3008balg2\u3009=\u2211k(balgk)2P(k). From Eq.

(7) as ik(t)=i(0)[balgk\u3008balg\u3009\u3008balg2\u3009(et/\u03c4\u22121)+1].(8)Substituting\nEq. (8) into i(t)=\u03a3kP(k)ik(t), we obtain i(t)=i(0)[\u3008balg\u30092\u3008balg2\u3009(et/\u03c4\u22121)+1],(9)which\nindicates that initially, the density of infected nodes increases exponentially over time.\nBecause of the exponentially growing behavior, a time characterizing the epidemic break can\nbe properly defined, which is \u03c4, where a larger value of\n\u03c4 signifies slower growth. From Eq. (6), one can see that \u03c4 is\ndirectly proportional to the ratio of the first to the second moment of the algorithmic\nbetweenness distribution and is inversely proportional to the spreading probability and the\npacket-generation rate. The exponentially growing behavior is true for the small values of\n\u03b2\u03bbN\u3008balg\u3009,\ni.e., \u03b2\u03bbN\u3008balg\u3009\u226a1.",

The\nmain difference from the infinite-capacity case lies in the likelihood of the emergence of\ntraffic congestion in the network, which occurs when the packet-generating rate exceeds a\ncritical value \u03bbc.24 Due to the complication associated with\ntraffic congestion, our analysis for the infinite-capacity (or congestion-free) case cannot\nbe applied, and we thus rely on numerical computation to explore the behavior of the\ncharacteristic time \u03c4. Figure 4 shows the density of the infected nodes i(t)\nas a function of time t for C = 10. For comparison, we\nalso include the case of C\u2192\u221e.\nThe critical value of \u03bbc\nis determined to be about 0.05, and we set \u03bb=1>\u03bbc\nso that traffic congestion can occur. Figure 4\ndemonstrates that i(t) increases more slowly in the case\nof finite C than that of infinite C, indicating that\ntraffic congestion can suppress the speed of epidemic spreading. The inset of Fig. 4 shows that, initially, the density of the infected nodes\nalso increases exponentially with time for the finite-capacity case so that a characteristic\noutbreak time \u03c4 can still be defined. Figure 5 shows \u03c4 as a function of the\npacket-generation rate \u03bb for both cases. We observe that\n\u03c4 scales inversely with\n\u03bb for infinite C, as\npredicted by Eq. (6). For finite values of\nC, when free traffic flow is guaranteed (\u03bb<\u03bbc), \u03c4\nessentially exhibits the same behavior. However, for \u03bb>\u03bbc\nso that congestion can occur, the value of \u03c4 becomes larger,\nsignifying a slowdown in the epidemic outbreak.",

Using physical reasoning, we have\narrived at a formula relating the characteristic time to parameters underlying both the\ntraffic and spreading dynamics, and also the ratio of the first to the second moment of the\nnetwork betweenness distribution. It is found that traffic-flow condition plays an important\nrole in the outbreak of epidemic spreading. Large-scale outbreak occurs more quickly as the\npacket-generation rate associated with the traffic dynamics is increased. However, an\nincrease in the average network connectivity and the emergence of traffic congestion can\nslow down the epidemic outbreak, where the former shortens the average traveling time of a\npacket and decreases the number of packages passing through each node, resulting in a\ndecrease in the infection probability of each node. In the presence of traffic jam, due to\nthe fact that the number of packets in the queue of a jammed node exceeds its delivery\ncapacity, the number of packets that can be forwarded is reduced compared to the case of\nabsence of congestion. In this perspective, the emergence of congestion can effectively slow\ndown the process of epidemic spreading.",
