These requirements cannot be well addressed by classical culture-based approaches. Therefore, a wide range of molecular approaches has been suggested. Microarrays are molecular tools that can be used for simultaneous identification of microorganisms in clinical and environmental samples. Main advantages of microarrays are high throughput, parallelism and miniaturization of the detection system. Furthermore, they allow for both high specificity and high sensitivity of the detection.",

However, due to limited multiplexing capabilities, qPCR will likely not be the appropriate molecular method to replace cultures. Miniaturization of conventional assays is a general trend in diagnostics as well as in biomedical research. Working with smaller volumes leads to reduced reagent consumption and faster reaction kinetics due to increased sample concentration. Parallel determination of numerous reactions is also highly desirable to save time and reduce costs, not to mention the possibility of large-scale comparison and intra-experimental quality control. Probes bound to a solid surface were therefore developed to allow spatial discrimination of numerous reactions performed in parallel, and culminated in the recent development of microarrays (Schena et al. 1995; Fodor et al. 1991 Fodor et al. , 1993 .",

They put into practice the fundamentals of complementary base-pairing (hybridization) that were first described by Ed Southern (Southern 1975) . In general, the strategy of microarray hybridization is reversed to that of a standard dot-blot, leading to recurring confusion in the nomenclature.

High-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarrays, have significant potential for identifying organisms in many areas of biomedical science, including health care, biological defense, and environmental monitoring. Using data from increasing numbers of whole microbial genomes, thousands of sequences can be selected to probe numerous genes of interest in cultures, clinical specimens, environmental samples, or host tissues. Reports have already shown that oligoarray hybridization can provide bacterial detection of a conserved bacterial gene (Small et al. 2001) , species identification (Wilson et al. 2002) , and genotyping of bacterial pathogens, by using large sets of discriminative epidemiological markers (Gingeras et al. 1998; Yue et al. 2001; Call, Borucki and Loge 2003; Volokhov et al. 2002; Chizhikov et al. 2001) . Detection of genetically-encoded virulence or antimicrobial resistance determinants (Lucchini, Thompson and Hinton 2001; Troesch et al. 1999; Chizhikov et al. 2001; Bekal et al. 2003 ) may also afford a major benefit for the selection of an adequate chemotherapy.",

In silico approaches allow for partial prediction of the hybridization behavior of the designed probes. However, it has become clear that the simple notion that short oligonucleotides with a mismatch (MM) should hybridize less efficiently than perfect match (PM) probes is not always applicable (Pozhitkov et al. 2006) . It has been demonstrated that the hybridization intensity of MM probes can depend on the nucleotide type (i.e., A, C, G, or T) and the position of the MM relative to the termini (Urakawa et al. 2002) ; and that some MM probes yield even higher signal intensities with the target than those of corresponding PM probes (Naef and Magnasco 2003) . Even well-designed probes can display differences in maximal hybridization capacity of 2 orders of magnitude under different hybridization conditions (Bodrossy and Sessitsch 2004) ; and thus, it is difficult to find one set of conditions that is optimal for all probes on an array (Kajiyama et al. 2003; Urakawa et al. 2003) . Factors affecting duplex formation on DNA microarrays include: probe density, microarray surface composition, spacer length, and the stabilities of the oligonucleotide-target duplexes, intra-and intermolecular self-structures, and RNA secondary structures (Matveeva et al. 2003; Peterson, Heaton and Georgiadis 2001; Halperin, Buhot and Zhulina 2005) .",

Prokaryotic RNAs are not poly-adenylated and thus are more challenging to work with when starting material is scarce. In such cases, the use of generic primers able to amplify parts of the 16s rRNA gene is often required (Anthony, Brown and French 2000; Rudi et al. 2002) , but the universality of such primers is questionable: false negative signals are not rare (Anthony, Brown and French 2000) .

Their results underscore the feasibility of using random amplification approaches and begin to systematically address the versatility of these approaches for unbiased pathogen detection from environmental sources (Stenger et al. 2002) . compared commercially available amplification methods, such as MessageAmp and GenomiPhi. They showed that this type of enzyme represents an interesting alternative of moderate cost for transcriptomic studies. Such amplifications permitted them to obtain significant amounts of nucleic acids, sufficient to perform microarray studies even when starting with a few tens of ng of material. Importantly, these methods showed exquisite reproducibility, even considering the data before normalization, which is the major requirement for their utilization in transcriptomic studies (Wilson et al. 2004 ). Finally, these nucleic amplification methods can be coupled to signal amplification; see for example Borucki et al.

Several methods have been suggested to alleviate this problem, such as the use of helper oligonucleotides (Peplies, Glockner and Amann 2003) , a two-probe proximal chaperon detection system (Small et al. 2001) , an appropriate labeling method (Franke-Whittle et al. 2006) , and a protocol to achieve optimized target lengths (Nguyen and Southern 2000; Southern, Mir and Shchepinov 1999; Yershov et al. 1996) . Since long targets can form secondary and tertiary structures that hinder efficient probe-target duplex formation, the sizes of the target molecule and its amplicon are often reduced via chemical, enzymatic, or thermal fragmentation methods Liu, Mirzabekov and Stahl 2001; Nguyen and Southern 2000; Proudnikov and Mirzabekov 1996; Small et al. 2001; Bodrossy et al. 2003 ).

            "text": "A more versatile, but still essentially mechanical, method for producing DNA arrays is to use the print heads out of commercial piezoelectric ink jet printers to deliver reagents to individual spots on the array (Southern 1989; Brennan and Heinecker 1995; Baldeschwieler, Gamble and Thierault 1995; Blanchard, Kaiser and Hood 1996) . A piezoelectric ink jet head consists of a small reservoir with an inlet port and a nozzle at the other end. When a voltage is applied to the crystal, it contracts laterally, thus deflecting the diaphragm and ejecting a small drop of fluid from the nozzle. Such devices are inexpensive and can deliver drops with volumes of tens of picoliters at rates of thousands of drops per second. In conjunction with a computer-controlled XY stepping stage to position the array with respect to the ink jet nozzles, it is possible to deliver different reagents to different spots on the array. Arrays of approx 250,000 spots can be addressed in a few minutes, with each spot receiving one drop of reagent. Agilent (www.agilent.com) has developed a flexible method for microarray production, centered around an in situ oligonucleotide synthesis method in which the ink jet printing process is modified to accommodate the delivery of phosphoramidites to directed locations on a glass surface (Blanchard, Kaiser and Hood 1996) . Achieving high density with the ink jet approach requires one more trick. Two drops of liquid applied too closely together on a surface will tend to spread into each other and mix. For 40 picoliter drops the minimal center-to-center spacing is about 600 microns. This limits the array density achievable with the ink jet method. One way around this is to engineer patterns in the surface chemistry of the array to produce spots of a relatively hydrophilic character surrounded by hydrophobic barriers [Southern (1989) PCT WO 89/10977] [Brennan (1995) US Patent 5,474,796] (Blanchard, Kaiser and Hood 1996) . Design flexibility and high densities constitute the two major advantages of this technique that can generate arrays at moderate costs.",

            "text": "New optical techniques are now available for microarray detection (Ferguson, Steemers and Walt 2000; Pawlak et al. 2002) which provide sensitivities high enough to detect femtomolar amounts of targets. Francois et al. (2003) nicely illustrated the improvements in detection sensitivity that can be achieved with different optical detection methods when using direct nonenzymatic labeling of bacterial nucleic acids. Microarrays detected by resonance light scattering (www.genicon.com) offer short turn-around times and exquisite sensitivity. Interestingly, the labeling and detection schemes offer an alternative at a reasonable cost to the expensive fluorescence-based methods. The principle of RLS is the following: when a suspension of nano-sized gold or silver particles is illuminated with a fine beam of white light, the scattered light has a clear (not cloudy) color that depends on its composition and particle size. This scattered light can be used as the signal for ultrasensitive analyte detection (Pasternack and Collings 1995) . Fig. 23 .5 depicts PWT-based microarrays. A 150 to 300 nm thin metallic oxide film (green) with high refractive index (e.g., Ta 2 O 5 or TiO 2 ) is deposited on a transparent support (grey) with a lower refractive index (e.g., glass or polymer). A parallel laser light beam (red) is coupled into the wave-guiding film by a diffractive grating that is etched into the substrate. The light propagates within this film and creates a strong evanescent field perpendicular to the direction of laser propagation into the adjacent medium (Duveneck et al. 2003) . The field strength decays exponentially with the distance from the waveguide surface, and its penetration depth is limited to about 400 nm (large orange arrow). This effect results in the selective excitation of fluorophore molecules located at or near the surface of the waveguide (red circles). For microarray applications, specific capture probes or recognition elements are immobilized on the waveguide surface. Upon fluorescence excitation by the evanescent field, the excitation and detection of fluorophores by a CCD camera is restricted to the sensing surface, whilst signals from unbound molecules in the bulk solution (blue) are not detected. This yields a significant increase in the signal/noise ratio compared to conventional optical detection methods .",

With this type of assay, the DNA probes (e.g., oligonucleotides) are attached to 5.6-nm polystyrene microspheres (\"beads\") containing an internal fluorescent dye. Each probe is assigned to a particular bead set containing a unique mixture of fluorescent dyes, or \"spectral address.\" Bead sets coupled to the probes of interest are then mixed together in the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate, allowing many different probes to be analyzed simultaneously. Target DNA molecules are labeled with a different and spectrally distinct fluorescent dye and hybridized to the probes on the beads. Beads with the hybridized targets are then separated and quantified using a two-laser flow cytometer. The unique internal color of the bead is read by one laser and serves to identify which probe is present on the bead. The second laser measures the fluorescent signal of the reporter dye present on the labeled target DNA and allows one to assess the strength of the hybridization between the target DNA and the probe. Because this technology allows up to 100 different probes to be analyzed in a single well of a 96-well plate, it promises to make microarray subtyping faster and less expensive. The established suspension array protocol requires that relatively short PCR products be used as targets (Dunbar et al. 2003) .",

Short oligoarrays, on the other hand, depend on PCR amplification to reduce the target complexity to a level compatible with the sensitivity of the probes (see Section 23.3.1.3.2). They are thus usually limited to a small number of marker genes (typically between one and ten). Marker genes used for phylogenetic analysis and the development of short oligo-MDMs need to fulfill several criteria: (1) widespread distribution throughout the targeted organism group, (2) a high degree of conservation allowing for universal PCR amplification, (3) the existence of variable regions allowing for the design of discriminating probes, and (4) no (or low rate of) horizontal gene transfer.",

Ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) are particularly suitable for species identification procedures because they occur universally, contain conserved as well as divergent regions, and are highly abundant in cells. A further advantage of the 16S rRNA gene consists in the availability of large sequence and probe databases (http://www.arb-home.de, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu, http://greengenes.lbl.gov, http://www.microbial-ecology.net/probebase). Technical challenges faced by short oligo-MDMs are related to detection sensitivity and hybridization specificity. The former usually refers to the minimum amount of target that can be reproducibly detected by individual probes in a given complex sample (see also Section 23.3.3.1); and the latter refers to the ability of the DNA microarray technique to differentiate targets from nontargets or to discriminate closely related DNA or RNA sequences that may possibly differ by only one base pair (Liu, Mirzabekov and Stahl 2001; Urakawa et al. 2002; Liu, Guo and Wu 2007) . See Section 23.3.3.3 for further details. The main limitation of the 16S rRNA gene lies in its extremely high degree of conservation. In many cases (a notable example being various genera of Enterobacteriaceae) it is not possible to design even species-specific probes based on it.",

The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) Consortium, an unprecedented, community-wide effort, spearheaded by FDA scientists, recently addressed experimentally the key issues surrounding the reliability of DNA microarray data. They assessed the performance of seven microarray platforms in profiling the expression of two commercially available RNA sample types. The results were compared not only at different locations and between different microarray formats, but also in relation to three more traditional quantitative gene expression assays. MAQC's main conclusions confirm that, with careful experimental design and appropriate data transformation and analysis, microarray data can indeed be reproducible and comparable among different formats and laboratories, irrespective of sample labeling format. The data also demonstrate that fold change results from microarray experiments correlate closely with results from assays like quantitative reverse transcription PCR (Shi et al. 2006) .",

One approach is to determine a set of invariant genes for normalization (Schadt et al. 2001; Tseng et al. 2001 ). Another approach recommends replicating genes on the array and using this within-array replication for normalization (Fan et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2004) . Standard normalization protocols rely on the assumption that the majority of genes on the microarray are not differentially expressed between samples . Jaeger et al. suggest including additional normalization genes on the small diagnostic microarrays, and they propose two strategies for selecting them from genome-wide microarray studies. The first is a data driven univariate selection of normalization genes. The second is multivariate and based on finding a balanced diagnostic signature (Jaeger and Spang 2006) .",

            "text": "Traditional phylogenetic classification of bacteria to study evolutionary relatedness is based on the characterization of a limited number of genes, rRNA, or signature sequences. However, owing to the acquisition of DNA through lateral gene transfer, the differences between closely related bacterial strains can be vast (Dorrell, Hinchliffe and Wren 2005) . By contrast, whole-genome sequencing comparisons allow a multitude of genes to be compared. Unfortunately, whole-genome sequencing is currently too expensive to allow the comparison of a large number of isolates of a species in a high-throughput scenario, as the global surveillance of infectious diseases requires. Therefore, since microbial genotyping is increasingly being used to track infectious diseases as they spread in human populations, another usage of microarrays has emerged. Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) permits assessing the genetic similarities and differences between closely related organisms. This approach is an adaptation of array methods used in gene expression studies, but applied to total genomic DNA (Murray et al. 2001; Lindroos et al. 2005) . CGH enables a \"bird's-eye view\" of all the genes absent or present in a given genome compared to the reference genome on the microarray. Whole-genome comparisons typically identify sets of \"core genes,\" which are shared by all strains in a species; and \"accessory genes,\" which are present in one or more strains in a species, and often result from gene acquisition. It is these differences that can often be used to identify genes and/or genetic islands related to \"gain-of-function traits\" in pathogenic strains (Dorrell, Hinchliffe and Wren 2005) .",

However, ambiguities in the interpretation of the ratios of hybridization and cross-hybridization to paralogous genes remain important limitations of the technique (van Bakel and Holstege 2004) . Solid statistical criteria for the absence or presence of ORFs are still lacking as a result of the diversity of the microarray design approaches, affecting the meta-analysis of the data obtained by different investigators (Joyce et al. 2002) . Garaizar et al. (2006) concluded that the construction or purchase of DNA microarrays and the performance of strain-to-strain hybridization experiments are still prohibitively expensive for routine application. The future use of arrays in epidemiology is likely to depend on the development of more cost-effective protocols, more robust and simplified formats, and the adequate evaluation of their performance (efficacy) and convenience (efficiency), compared with other genotyping methods. Indeed, more focused assays are finding broad application in routine bacterial epidemiology. Using commercially-available low-density microarrays fitted within microtubes (www.clondiag.com), papers have reported the development and validation of assays for bacterial genotyping and virulence gene detection (Korczak 2005 ) as well as for extensive detection of antimicrobial resistance determinants in Gram-positive bacteria (Perreten et al. 2005) . Different low-density array formats permitted the recent release of the first commercially available microarray-based assay for the genotyping of human papilloma viruses, HPV (www.genomica.es) (www.greinerbioone.com).",

Using all possible combinations of an n-mer allows \"walking\" at every position along a nucleotide sequence. This approach is currently limited by the complexity of the algorithm required to generate contigs (conversion of a listing of hybridized n-mers into a meaningful sequence). Also, if the sequence undergoing analysis contains a repeat region (the same sequence appearing more than once within the target molecule), the reconstruction diagram will have to display a corresponding number of branching points, leading to an ambiguous sequence. This type of array is the only one capable of detecting sequences that are lacking in large electronic libraries. In contrast, dedicated arrays are used for repetitive sequencing (resequencing) of the same target for detection of nucleotide polymorphisms or functional mutations (see Section 23.5.4).",

This approach has been named the Non-Cognate Hybridization System (NCHS) (Schrenzel and Hibbs 2003) . By synthesizing all probes of a given length that can be generated by a combination of four nucleotides, microarrays could detect any single organism. Unfortunately, for generating realistic probe lengths (i.e., permitting unique sequence identification as well as adequate hybridization behavior), the total number of permutations of the four nucleotides would yield very large numbers of possible probes (i.e., 4 13 =67,108,864 probes for 13-mers nucleotides). The synthesis of such large microarrays is currently technically impossible. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools that would be necessary for the microarray analysis of billons of probes are not yet available. Thus, reducing the probe set and the complexity of the analytical approach is warranted. Random reduction of the probe set to a smaller number of probes might result in potentially missing sequences characteristic for given pathogens. An alternative would be the pruning of low informative probes, i.e., probes that have no targets in a collection of selected micro-organisms. However, this approach yields ultimately to another cognate design, with the inherent limitations described above. Another way to reduce the probe set is to consider permutations of only two nucleotides. This divides the probe set by 2 n\u22122 where n is the length of the probes. This microarray design is truly noncognate and guarantees that no organism is a priori favored or missed. By analogy, Roth et al. have designed a universal microarray system combined with an enzymatic manipulation step that is capable of generating expression profiles from any organism without requiring a priori sequence-specific knowledge of transcript sequences (Roth et al. 1998 ).",

These molecular barcodes can be used as tags in various experimental conditions, for probing different targets under various experimental formats. These multipurpose arrays serve only to quantitatively detect the presence of barcoded probes, whose specificity is determined by the user. Molecular inversion probe (MIP) technology was initially developed for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human genes (Hardenbol et al. 2003) . MIP technology has been shown to work well for multiplexing, i.e., massive parallel processing (12,000 MIPs in the same reaction tube) (Hardenbol et al. 2005) . The power and versatility of MIP technology makes it perfectly suited for the identification and quantification of microbes. MIP's high sensitivity and specificity in detecting large numbers of SNPs (Hardenbol et al. 2003; Hardenbol et al. 2005) should allow one to harness this technology to detect a large number of pathogens and to identify multiple infections in an individual sample. A molecular inversion probe is comprised of genomic recognition sequences, common amplification sequences, and a molecular barcode for each genotype assigned to a specific gene. This probe is a linear oligonucleotide with target-complementary sequences at the ends and a noncomplementary linking segment in between (Thiyagarajan et al. 2006) .",

We are shifting away from Koch's postulates that required evidence of bacterial growth to the routine use of advanced molecular biology tools. Revolutions bring important changes in the way we think. The extended use of molecular biology will help discover new species that could not be cultivated. Quantitative aspects of bacterial loads, easily addressed on petri dishes, will need to be transposed and validated using molecular biology tools. This revolution should now be supported also by a better appreciation of the remarkable diversity of the bacterial world; the understanding that adequate taxonomy is needed; and the knowledge that host-pathogen interactions will have to be addressed perhaps more straightforward without last part.",
