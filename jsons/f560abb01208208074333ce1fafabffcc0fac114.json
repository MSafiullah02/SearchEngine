Il est vrai que certains des plus grands bio\u00e9thiciens jouissent d'une grande influence nationale et internationale, mais les interactions lors de nouvelles conf\u00e9rences internationales ou la consultation de publications apportent souvent des nouvelles r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices -et potentiellement humiliantes -sur le peu d'effet que notre recherche a tendance \u00e0 avoir sur ce qui se passe ailleurs. En mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 nos sentiments de blessure professionnelle, nous devrions nous inqui\u00e9ter bien davantage d'un \u00e9ventuel effort inutile et d'une entrave aux progr\u00e8s dans le domaine, fond\u00e9e sur une ignorance involontaire de la fa\u00e7on dont d'autres r\u00e9gions g\u00e9ographiques font leur bio\u00e9thique. Il n'est pas logique, d'un point de vue pratique, que les efforts soient dupliqu\u00e9s, surtout si quelqu'un d'autre l'a fait mieux, ou du moins plus t\u00f4t. Le gaspillage est encore plus grand lorsque l'on explore un terrain d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien \u00e9tudi\u00e9, puis que l'on constate que les ressources suppl\u00e9mentaires ne valent pas la peine d'\u00eatre utilis\u00e9es. \u00c0 tout le moins, les recherches inutiles sont une occasion perdue d'am\u00e9liorer la bio\u00e9thique. Humans and other sentient animals have a tendency to interpret the world using only the framework of their normality. The result is that we make the universe revolve around us by most things being given the meaning assigned to them by the genetic and learned lenses we use to perceive our reality. This is not to say that we are doing something intentionally illicit by making partially subjective and artificial what was wholly objective and real. Far from it. What is happening is that our thinking about the world takes an incredibly complex entity comprised of innumerable, interdependent relationships between an immeasurable number of objects, and then makes it understandable to us so that we may meaningfully interact with it. The incomprehensibly complex is trimmed down to the manageable by focusing our attention on what is relevant for us in those particular circumstances. What is relevant for us, in the vast majority of cases, is decided by how the data from external sources is processed by our subconscious and conscious mind, as well as by the decisions being made without us being aware of them.",

We do this so that we may make our scholarship more useful in achieving the intended outcomes we desire, and especially if that research is to be used in life and death matters.

The principles, instead, are more like guidelines that each person can use in identifying when a moral dilemma or issue arises and then in her decision making. For an ethical dilemma or problem, the individual will weigh and balance the conflicting values, guidelines and norms to find a solution that one or more reasonable people can agree is reasonable and morally appropriate. Moreover, Childress and Beauchamp [1] also claim that these principles have general or universal application because they form a common moral framework that all moral agents in the world use as part of their moral psychology. If used correctly, then Principlism can provide an answer to a moral dilemma or problem that is rational and justified for those particular circumstances. The principles' apparent simplicity, commonality, and usefulness explain a great deal of Principlism's appeal and widespread adoption. 7 ",

R.E. Florida [11] , for instance, argues that Buddhism lacks a principle to respect for autonomy. If correct, then not only is there an issue about how common the four principles are in common morality, but adherents of Buddhism trying to employ Principlism in their decision making will lead to significantly different results from individuals from European cultures.",

Taylor The Global Code of Conduct of Research in Resource-Poor Settings states that its four values of fairness, respect, care, and honesty has more global applicability, even with significant variations in cultural norms and practices [16] . In other words, and among other alleged failures, Principlism is incomplete, which can make it a dangerously inadequate tool, especially if the principles are primarily \"chapter headings for a discussion of some concepts which are often only superficially related to each other\" [17, p.221] 3 .

In fact, it is possible that people do not base their decisions on abstract ethical principles, but instead respond intuitively or to each situation's unique characteristics and how they perceive them [20] .

That process means that only those who fall within the study's definition of common morality will be surveyed, thereby guaranteeing that they think the way the authors' do [5] .

The question asked by several critics is whether it actually prevents people from performing the ethical reasoning they need to do in their lives. Clouser and Gert, for example, state that the principles, at best, act as mere checklists [17] . Not only does that approach make ethical reasoning something that a computer can be successfully programmed to do, it misses what morality is and how it works. If morality is more of a computer program, then there might be a tendency for individuals to follow the checklist, and come to a justified conclusion based upon it, but totally miss finding and acting on what they should do and who they should be whilst doing it. In fact, Principlism might be a form of reductionism that omits the real world's richness with its actual complexities, ambiguities, and uncertainties [7, p.289] , as well as why we care about such things when we act and decide who we should be. Given that these are medical decisions that have enormous impact on vulnerable people's flourishing, as well as those with whom they have caring relationships and other stakeholders, as well as society itself, then we require a framework that better captures morality's reality.",

Even more, it demonstrates a required humility to take those problematic areasprovided that they are proven with adequate justification to have that statusand then revise the scholarship to eliminate the problem, or to abandon the work as unsalvageable. It might even inspire Principlists and others J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 to explore other potential tensions to see if they are actual problems or mere mirages. At the very least, those who would use Principlism should be sensitive to its possible failings when doing their work, and allow others equal leeway to employ their own moral reasoning frameworks. And that is the benefit of a dynamic, critical marketplace of ideas. It helps everyone draw closer to the truth by the constant evaluation of the status quo and its justification, and the incentive to make changes to make one's research and scholarship more accurate.",
