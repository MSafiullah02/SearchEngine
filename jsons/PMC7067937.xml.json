Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a series of adverse effects (e.g., tracheal lesions, ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury, and ventilator-induced diaphragm injury) [6, 7], whereas premature extubation exposes the patient to cardiovascular stress due to spontaneous breathing, often requiring the reinstitution of ventilatory support [8]. Although international guidelines recommend the implementation of spontaneous breathing trials [9], used alone this practice is ineffective in predicting weaning failure and reintubation [10\u201313]. A number of studies have investigated and proposed different parameters as outcome predictors of weaning from mechanical ventilation; however, a clear understanding of the ideal time to proceed with extubation for a successful outcome continues to elude us [14, 15]. Cardiac failure, diaphragmatic dysfunction and acute respiratory illness (lung parenchyma disease, or upper or lower airway obstructions), neurological status, and intra-abdominal issues are among the known leading causes of failed weaning [3, 16].",

In fact, our capacity to study the individual organs ultrasonographically has become so finely tuned and specialized that physicians risk overlooking a more integrated examination of the patient. A comprehensive approach to invasive mechanical ventilation should include an extensive ultrasonographic assessment of cardiac function, diaphragmatic activity, and lung parenchyma. In particular, much light has been shone on the use of ultrasonographic assessment of diaphragmatic dysfunction as a predictor of weaning failure. That said, it is fundamental that the diaphragm does not receive excessive attention at the expense of other predictive factors. A simultaneous and comprehensive ultrasound examination of the cardio-pulmonary-diaphragmatic district may confer valuable predictive information regarding successful weaning from mechanical ventilation, although literature in this regard is still limited [17]. It is also important to bear in mind that other factors able to negatively influence the weaning outcome exist outside the cardio-pulmonary-diaphragmatic area (i.e., the neurological status and intra-abdominal hypertension) that cannot be evaluated with ultrasound [18, 19].",

Invasive mechanical ventilation is a risky journey for a critically ill patient admitted to the intensive care unit because of acute illness, IMV itself, or a failed weaning attempt. Weaning is the process in which the breathing effort is progressively returned from the machine to the patient. This process consists of 3 key steps, Fig. 1: first, when the patient\u2019s clinical conditions permit it, ventilation supports are progressively decreased (Ready, weaning!); second, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) assesses the patient\u2019s capability to breathe autonomously (Ready, breathing!); and third, the patient is liberated from mechanical ventilation (Ready, extubation!) [20, 21]. Three main SBT strategies are described in the literature: the T-piece trial; the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) trial\u2014in which the CPAP applied is equal to the previously applied positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); and positive support ventilation, which uses a low level of pressure support (5\u20138 cmH2O).",

However, strong evidence does exist supporting the employment of a short-term (30 min) breathing trail and low-level pressure support (8 cmH2O) [22]. If the SBT is accompanied by patient discomfort (i.e., anxiety or fatigue) and/or cardio-respiratory distress (i.e., RR \u2265 35 bpm, SpO2 < 90%, HR variability > 20%, hemodynamic instability) [23], then it is considered to have failed. In the absence of such responses, the SBT is deemed successful and the patient can be considered for airway removal (Ready, extubing!). Although heterogeneity exists in the definition of successful weaning, it is generally taken as the patient\u2019s capacity to maintain spontaneous breathing for at least 48 h following extubation [3]. As mentioned above, despite international guidelines recommending the implementation of spontaneous breathing trials [3, 9], used alone SBTs are ineffective in predicting weaning failure and reintubation [10\u201313]. One possible solution to this may be the implementation of integrated cardio-pulmonary-diaphragmatic assessments for the detection of predictive indicators of weaning failure.",

            "text": "In the case of shock patients admitted to intensive care, most are resuscitated with the use of mechanical ventilation and intravenous fluid for respiratory and circulatory support. Regarding fluid management procedures in shock patients, recent literature has schematized its practice into four different phases, adopting the acronym ROSE: resuscitation (R), optimization (O), stabilization (S), and evacuation (E) [24]. Resuscitation, in some cases, could be too aggressive with the risk of fluid-overload, whereas evacuation could be too fast with the risk of hypovolemia and low cardiac output state (see below). In the first case, previous over-hydration with a positive fluid balance has been associated with death and an increased risk of failed weaning from mechanical ventilation in surviving patients [25, 26]. This could be explained by the fact that shifting the patient from mechanical ventilation (positive airway pressure) to a T-piece trial (negative airway pressure) can increase cardiac preload and unmask an underlying cardiac problem. Lemaire and colleagues were the first to demonstrate this vicious circle [8]. Potential cardiac complications can be monitored in 3 main ways: one is direct but invasive\u2014measurement of the cardiac filing pressure by pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC); the remaining two are indirect and un-invasive\u2014one entails the use of heart or lung ultrasound, and the other the rapid measurement of natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of acute heart failure [27, 28].",

            "text": "Monitoring for cardiac complications is necessary because the sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs of acute heart failure in intensive care patients are poor [29]. PAC is reserved for specific severe cases. It is used for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and to guide fluid and catecholamine management; however, its routine use has been abandoned globally due to the lack of any outcome benefits [30, 31]. Ultrasound, on the other hand, has become an invaluable tool in the ICU thanks to its widespread availability at the patient\u2019s bedside and the absence of any known side effects [28]. Moreover, the role of echocardiography in the detection of cardiac origins of weaning failure has grown significantly over the last 15 years. In particular, we now know that impaired systolic function (i.e., a small left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) is less frequently associated with weaning failure in patients who failed the SBT (33% of cases) than left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (67% of cases) [28, 32, 33]. To investigate this latter condition, trans-mitral flow is interrogated using a pulse wave Doppler placed over the mitral valve in an apical four-chamber view. An early wave (E wave) is displayed on the monitor, Fig. 2a, that represents the first phase of the diastole as a passive phenomenon, limited only by the stiffness of the left ventricle or by interventricular interdependence\u2014right ventricular push over the left ventricle via the septum. A stiff ventricle generates an elevated filling pressure, leading to pulmonary edema. In addition to trans-mitral Doppler, an E wave inpatient with sinus rhythm is followed by atrial contraction (A wave, Fig. 2a). The left ventricular preload is the sum of the E and A waves at a price of low or average left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) less than 12\u201314 mmHg. However, to estimate the LVEDP non-invasively, the E/A ratio has shown to be preload dependent and insufficient [34]. On the other hand, tissue Doppler directly measures myocardial velocities by means of the E\u02b9 wave in a load-independent way, Fig. 2b. The combination of the trans-mitral Doppler E wave, the tissue Doppler E\u02b9 wave, and the E/E\u02b9 ratio at the end of an SBT also seems to be capable of predicting weaning failure from diastolic dysfunction in patients with arrhythmia, immediately after and 10 min after extubation, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75 and 0.86, respectively [33]. However, two main limitations of these methods need to be recognized. First, although an E/E\u02b9 value < 8 can accurately identify patients with a normal LVEDP, and an E/E\u02b9 value > 15 can identify those with an elevated LVEDP, a gray zone exists between the values of 8 and 15 [33\u201335]; second, not all intensive care clinicians possess advanced echocardiography skills; and third, LVEDP may also be elevated in cases of increased intra-abdominal pressure (see below).",

They found that the BNP-guided fluid strategy was associated with increased use of diuretics, more negative fluid balance leading to a shorter mechanical ventilation time, and more ventilator-free days, but no change in ICU length-of-stay, morbidity, or mortality.

As a consequence, skeletal muscles and vital organs receive less blood flow, contributing to an increased production and impaired removal of lactate [41]. The onset of acidemia and hypoxemia then leads to an increase in the work of breathing due to induced compensatory hyperventilation. Of note, whenever the muscle oxygen and nutrient demands exceed the supply, the diaphragm\u2019s ability to generate and sustain force decreases and muscle failure ensues [42].

Furthermore, the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in mechanically ventilated dogs may have reduced lactate production due to the absence of diaphragmatic activity [41]. Impairment of the diaphragmatic contraction process during cardiogenic shock may be the underlying mechanism responsible for ventilatory failure (see below) [43].

Diaphragm displacement is associated with lung volume during the inspiratory phase [57], but it does not correlate with and does not quantify the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort [58]; furthermore, its assessment is influenced by numerous factors (see Table 1) [45]. It should also be noted that diaphragmatic excursion can be influenced by PEEP and levels of ventilator support during mechanical ventilation [55]: by increasing lung expiratory volumes, higher levels of PEEP lower the diaphragmatic domes, resulting in a decreased diaphragmatic excursion; during assisted ventilation, diaphragmatic excursion results from ventilator support plus the patient\u2019s inspiratory efforts [56]. Therefore, only diaphragm thickening can provide a reliable indicator of diaphragm function during assisted mechanical ventilation [57].",
