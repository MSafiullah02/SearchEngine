            "text": "Most of the mechanisms of innate defense described in detail in Chapter 3 can help the host combat any type of pathogen. The first obstacles encountered by an invader are the intact skin and mucosae. Pathogens are prevented from gaining a firm foothold on the skin by the toughness and routine shedding of the keratin layers protecting the epidermis, and also by having to compete with commensal microorganisms. Pathogens ingested into the gut or inhaled into the respiratory tract are trapped by mucus or succumb to microbicidal molecules in the body secretions or to the low pH and hydrolases of the gut. However, a breach of the skin or mucosae may allow a pathogen access to subepithelial tissues. Barrier penetration may also occur in individuals whose immune systems have been compromised by either disease or therapeutic immunosuppression. These lapses in immune defense may allow opportunistic pathogens, which are normally harmless to a healthy individual, to cause disease. In contrast, invasive pathogens can enter the body even when surface defenses are intact. Invasive organisms assaulting the mucosae frequently gain access via the M cells of the FAE or by binding to host cell surface molecules that initiate receptor-mediated internalization.Recall that FAE is a region of follicle-associated epithelium in a body tract mucosa as described in Chapter 12 and illustrated in Figure 12-2.\n",

Coating of the pathogen by C3b or MBL facilitates its elimination by the alternative or lectin complement cascades, respectively. At a cellular level, general innate defense is mediated by the PRRs of resident DCs, neutrophils and other granulocytes, macrophages, NK cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and NKT cells. These PRRs include TLRs, NLRs, RLRs, CLRs, scavenger receptors, and cell-bound collectins, as well as the antigen recognition receptors of NK, NKT and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. In addition, soluble collectins in the extracellular matrix that have bound to pathogens or their products may activate complement or stimulate phagocytosis.Recall that several classes of PRRs expressed by innate leukocytes were illustrated in Figure 3-4 and their features summarized in Table 3-2.\nNOTE: Recent research has revealed a prominent antipathogen role for the inflammasomes generated following NLR engagement. As described in Chapter 3 and illustrated in Figure 3-5, the engagement of the NLRs NLRP1, NLRP3 or NLRC4 triggers the formation of the NLRP1, NLRP3 or NLRC4 inflammasome, respectively. For example, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to DAMPs such as host-derived uric acid or cholesterol crystals, or PAMPs derived from extracellular bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Yersinia enterocolitica, or from intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Bordatella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila. Viral PAMPs (such as those derived from influenza virus), parasite PAMPs (such as those derived from Schistosoma mansoni or Plasmodia falciparum), or fungal PAMPs (such as those derived from Candida albicans) may also induce NLRP3 formation. The PAMPs in these cases include bacterial toxins, viral ssRNA or dsRNA, fungal cell wall components, or parasite egg antigens. NLRC4 inflammasomes also respond to PAMPs from Salmonella, Legionella or Pseudomonas species. NLRP1 inflammasomes are activated by a toxin of Bacillus anthracis and have been implicated in combatting some herpesvirus infections.\nRecall that inflammasome assembly results in the processing and activation of the key pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 (see Ch. 3).\n",

            "text": "Different exotoxins and endotoxins cause disease by different means and in different locations. For example, infection with Vibrio cholerae results in the local release of an exotoxin that binds to gut epithelial cells and induces the severe diarrhea that characterizes cholera. Clostridium botulinum produces a neuro-exotoxin that blocks the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, resulting in the paralysis characteristic of botulism. In contrast, damage to a host caused by an endotoxin is always immunopathic. The LPS of Gram-negative bacteria activates macrophages and induces them to release pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF and IL-1. As described in Box 3-2 in Chapter 3, although a little TNF and IL-1 is a good thing, the very high concentrations of these cytokines that are secreted in response to a significant Gram-negative bacterial infection can induce high fever and endotoxic (septic) shock.NOTE: The ability of an individual to fight off infection can be influenced by the particular allele of a given PRR gene he/she expresses. As defined in Chapter 6, the varying nucleotide sequences of alleles of the same gene are known as polymorphisms. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are alleles that differ from the cognate gene by one nucleotide. It is estimated that there are \u223c10 million SNPs in the human genome. An SNP may affect the rate of transcription or translation of the resulting protein product, its amino acid sequence, its stability and half-life, its interaction with receptors, and/or its function. For example, a particular TLR4 SNP is associated with an increased risk of endotoxic shock following infection by Gram-negative bacteria, while a certain TLR2 SNP renders individuals highly susceptible to endotoxic shock following infection by Gram-positive bacteria. A database of defined human SNPs is maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP so that medical scientists can easily access this growing resource.\n",

            "text": "Because extracellular bacteria cannot routinely \u201chide\u201d within host cells, antibodies are generally highly effective against these species. Polysaccharides present in bacterial cell walls make perfect Ti antigens for B cell activation (Fig. 13-1, #1\n), while other bacterial components supplying Td antigens induce primarily a Th2 response that provides T help for antibacterial B cells (#2). Neutralizing IgM antibodies dominate in the vascular system, while smaller IgG antibodies protect the tissues. These antibodies neutralize bacteria by physically preventing them from attaching to host cell surfaces (#3). Even though they do not need to enter host cells for replication, most extracellular bacteria try to adhere to host cells to avoid being swept off or out of the host by skin sloughing or movement of the intestinal contents. Antibodies can also serve as opsonins, coating the bacterium such that it is engulfed by phagocytic leukocytes expressing FcRs (#4). Once captured inside the phagocyte, extracellular bacteria are usually very vulnerable to killing via pH changes, defensins, and the ROIs and RNIs associated with the phagosomal respiratory burst. Antibodies made against bacterial exotoxins are called antitoxins. Antitoxins neutralize a toxin by preventing it from binding to the cells it would otherwise damage (#5). If the toxin is the sole element causing disease in the host, the production of the antitoxin alone will be enough to restore health. For example, human resistance to tetanus or diphtheria relies solely on antitoxins directed against the Clostridium tetani exotoxin or Corynebacterium diphtheriae exotoxin, respectively.",

            "text": "All three pathways of complement activation can be brought to bear on extracellular bacteria (Fig. 13-1, #6). Antibacterial antibodies of the appropriate isotype (particularly IgM) will bind to complement component C1q to trigger the classical cascade. The alternative pathway can be activated by the binding of C3b to peptidoglycan in Gram-positive bacterial cell walls or LPS in Gram-negative bacterial cell walls. The lectin pathway is activated by the binding of MBL to distinctive sugars arrayed on bacterial cell surfaces. Almost all types of extracellular bacteria can be eliminated by phagocytosis facilitated by the binding of opsonins such as C3b that are produced during complement activation. In addition, bacteria possessing a membrane can be dispatched by MAC-mediated lysis. Complement is particularly crucial for defense against the Neisseria group of Gram-negative bacteria.Mechanisms of complement activation were illustrated in detail in Figure 3-7.\nNOTE: There is growing evidence that Th17 responses linked to the apoptosis of infected host cells are important for defense against extracellular bacteria. Infection of a host with a pathogen that preferentially colonizes the mucosae, such as S. pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori, often results in the generation of Th17 effector cells that play a key role in bacterial clearance. Some immunologists believe that an infected mucosal cell which undergoes apoptosis in an inflammatory environment furnishes a combination of PAMPs and DAMPs that induce DCs to produce TGF\u03b2 and IL-6. Any Th0 cell interacting with such a DC is then directed to undergo Th17 cell differentiation. In contrast, a host cell that undergoes routine apoptosis in the absence of infection produces only DAMPs that induce the DC to secrete TGF\u03b2 alone, a situation that favors iTreg cell generation (refer to Ch. 10).\n",

For example, H. pylori contains modified forms of LPS and flagellin that bind abnormally to TLR4 or TLR5, respectively, and fail to induce proper TLR signaling. Y. enterocolitica produces a protein called the V antigen that binds to TLR2 and stimulates production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. This IL-10 then inhibits host cell secretion of IFN\u03b3 and TNF. Mice lacking TLR2 are thus actually less susceptible than wild type animals to Y. enterocolitica infection because their immune systems cannot be co-opted in this way and continue to produce IFN\u03b3 and TNF.",

While S. pyogenes infection of the topmost layer of a tissue causes relatively mild disease (like strep throat), deeper infections can cause necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease), which can be lethal.

Some non-encapsulated extracellular bacteria avoid capture by phagocytes by temporarily entering non-phagocytes such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts. To gain access to these cells, the pathogens may inject bacterial proteins into the host cell that promote either macropinocytosis or cytoskeletal rearrangements facilitating bacterial uptake. Extracellular bacteria may also inject bacterial proteins that have direct antiphagocyte activity. For example, Y. enterocolitica injects into macrophages a bacterial phosphatase that binds to certain tyrosine-phosphorylated host proteins required for intracellular signaling and actin reorganization. When the bacterial phosphatase dephosphorylates these host proteins, phagocytosis of the bacterium is blocked.",

Many extracellular bacteria synthesize substances that inactivate various steps of the complement cascade. For example, group B Streptococci contain sialic acid in their cell walls that degrades C3b and blocks alternative complement activation. Other Streptococci produce proteins that bind to the normally fluid phase RCA protein Factor H and fix it onto the bacterial surface. In its hijacked site, the recruited Factor H makes any C3b that has attached susceptible to degradation.

Those bacteria that escape the defensins and are taken up by neutrophil phagocytosis find themselves, not in a haven for replication, but rather within a phagosome that can kill them via the powerful respiratory burst. Memory Th17 cells have an important role to play here, as the IL-17 they secrete recruits neutrophils to the site of invasion and promotes phagocytosis. Memory Th17 cells also recruit activated macrophages and stimulate both their phagocytic activity and production of the IL-12 needed for Th1 cell differentiation (#2). For both neutrophils and macrophages, the killing of phagocytosed bacteria is frequently enhanced by certain host proteins present within the phagolysosomal membrane, and also by host enzymes in the ER or Golgi that regulate the maturation of pathogen-containing phagosomes. These enzymes are greatly upregulated in response to IFNs or LPS. In addition to phagocytosis, macrophages activated by TLR engagement produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote NK cell activation and Th1 differentiation (see following sections).NOTE: The role of TLRs in defense against intracellular bacteria has been highlighted by the fact that lipoprotein and lipoglycan components of Mycobacteria are readily recognized by TLR2 and TLR4.

It is not unusual for intracellular bacteria phagocytosed by macrophages to be resistant to routine phagosomal killing, and the IFN\u03b3 produced by activated Th1 effectors hyperactivates the macrophages such that they gain enhanced microbicidal powers. The sequence of events starts when bacterial antigens either secreted by the bacteria themselves or released by necrotic infected cells are taken up by DCs. In the local lymph node, peptides from these antigens are bound to MHC class II and presented to CD4+ T cells (Fig. 13-2, #6). IL-12 produced by macrophages favors the differentiation of Th1 effectors, which supply the intercellular contacts (particularly CD40L) and IFN\u03b3 that drive macrophage hyperactivation. A hyperactivated macrophage produces large quantities of ROIs and RNIs that efficiently kill almost all intracellular pathogens. If the bacterium is still resistant, however, a hyperactivated macrophage may go on to participate in formation of a granuloma (see later) in order to contain the threat.\nBox 13-1Lessons from LeprosyThe importance of the Th1 response to defense against intracellular pathogens is clearly illustrated in human immunity to Mycobacterium leprae infection. Individuals who are predisposed to mounting Th2 responses (i.e., their Th cells preferentially secrete IL-4 and IL-10) and are infected with M. leprae suffer from a devastating form of leprosy known as lepromatous leprosy. The DCs in the epidermis and dermis of these patients exhibit reduced expression of the costimulatory molecule B7, which further compromises the effectiveness of the T cell response. In contrast, individuals who usually mount Th1 responses (i.e., their Th cells preferentially secrete IFN\u03b3) and are infected with M. leprae present with tuberculoid leprosy, which is generally a less severe form of the disease. The cell-mediated immunity favored by a Th1 response is clearly more effective against this intracellular pathogen than the Th2 response that promotes humoral immunity.Recent studies have shown that TLRs are intimately involved in the balance between lepromatous and tuberculoid leprosy. DCs and monocytes in lesions of patients with tuberculoid leprosy show strong TLR2 and TLR1 expression, but DCs and monocytes in lesions of patients with lepromatous leprosy do not. A heterodimer of TLR1/TLR2 forms a PRR that recognizes a lipoprotein of M. leprae. Engagement of this TLR1/TLR2 complex normally results in leukocyte production of IL-2, IL-12, TNF and IFN\u03b3, which influence nearby DCs to induce Th1 differentiation. In the absence of normal TLR1/TLR2 signaling, however, the leukocytes tend to produce IL-10, which induces DCs to promote Th2 differentiation. Thus, a lower level of the TLR1/TLR2 complex, or a failure in the TLR1/TLR2 signaling pathway, most often favors the development of the more severe form of leprosy.",

Eventually, the granuloma exterior becomes calcified and fibrotic, and cells in the center undergo necrosis.

For example, M. leprae infects the Schwann cells of the human peripheral nervous system. Other intracellular bacteria deliberately enter phagocytes but then inactivate them or take steps to escape phagosomal killing. For example, L. monocytogenes accesses mouse phagocytes via host FcRs and CRs but then synthesizes a protein called listeriolysin O (LLO) that induces pore formation in the phagolysosomal membrane. The bacterium escapes through the pore into the relative safety of the cytoplasm. B. pertussis expresses a surface receptor that binds to a glycoprotein found primarily on phagocytes, promoting deliberate engulfment of the bacterium. Once inside the phagocyte, B. pertussis neutralizes the respiratory burst and inhibits other bactericidal activities, allowing the pathogen to persist within the host cell. When M. tuberculosis finds itself being engulfed in a macrophage phagosome, it recruits to the phagosome a host protein called TACO that inhibits the fusion of the phagosome to lysosomes. M. tuberculosis also produces NH4\n+, which reverses the acidification of phagolysosomes and promotes fusion with harmless endosomes. In addition, M. tuberculosis infection interferes with the expression of host genes needed for microbicidal action and macrophage hyperactivation. As a result of all these measures, Mycobacteria can survive within host phagosomes for long periods. Certain Salmonella species produce molecules that decrease the recruitment of NADPH oxidase to the phagolysosome, inhibiting ROI and RNI generation. Other intracellular bacteria block phagosomal ROIs and RNIs either by chemically neutralizing them or by synthesizing the enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase that break down ROIs, RNIs and hydrogen peroxide.",

Viruses frequently kill or at least inactivate host cells, depriving the host of these cells\u2019 normal functions such that clinical symptoms appear. As well, the immune response to the viral infection frequently damages host tissues and induces inflammation, causing immunopathic disease. Clinicians classify diseases caused by viruses as either acute or chronic. When a host is initially infected with a virus, the host experiences acute disease in that the illness may be mild or severe (depending on the degree of pathogenicity or virulence of the virus) but is only short term in duration. An effective immune response removes the virus completely from the body. However, sometimes viruses are not completely eliminated during the acute infection and remain in the body to establish persistent infections. The ongoing low levels of viral replication associated with these persistent infections cause long-term or recurrent illnesses that are considered chronic diseases. In some cases, a host will experience no chronic disease symptoms at all if his/her cell-mediated immune response is effective enough to block the assembly of new virus particles. The spread of the virus to fresh host cells is halted, and the virus then persists in the body in an inactive state and does not replicate. However, if the host\u2019s cell-mediated response weakens due to aging or immunosuppression, the latent virus reactivates, replicates and again causes acute disease.

This mechanism is most effective in long-lived hosts (like humans) that can sustain multiple re-infections, and is particularly important if the virus lacks the ability to become latent. The rapid modification of viral antigens through random mutations is known as antigenic drift. For example, like all RNA viruses, influenza virus cannot proofread its RNA genome during replication and thus sustains a high rate of mutation. The hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins, which are the only two viral proteins present on the surface of the influenza virion, are thus subtly different from viral generation to generation. These minor virus variants often replicate preferentially in the host, because they are not neutralized by antibodies raised against earlier strains. New influenza strains created by antigenic drift are responsible for localized influenza outbreaks. HIV is another virus that undergoes very rapid antigenic drift, even within a single infected individual.

The influenza virus genome exists as eight separate single-stranded RNA segments, each of which encodes a single viral protein. With such a genetic structure, two different influenza strains that simultaneously infect a single host cell can undergo a re-assortment (sometimes inaccurately called \u201crecombination\u201d) of their genomic segments (Fig. 13-4\n). Virus particles containing new combinations of parental RNA suddenly arise, dramatically changing the spectrum of protein epitopes presented to the immune system. This antigenically novel flu virus is safe from antibodies and CTLs raised during previous exposure or vaccination, and so rapidly becomes entrenched in vulnerable hosts constituting a pandemic (see Box 13-2).NOTE: Clinical immunologists define a particular antigenic shift of an influenza virus by the identity of its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) molecules, since it is the presence or absence of B cell memory to these surface glycoproteins that influences the production of neutralizing antibodies. The new strains that result from antigenic shift are often referred to as \u201cinfluenza virus subtypes.\u201d\nAn epidemic involves an increased frequency of disease in one location. A pandemic is unrestricted geographically and leads to a global epidemic of disease.\nBox 13-2The H1N1 Pandemic of 2009The antigenic drift that routinely generates a new influenza virus every year is usually responsible for 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness worldwide and 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths. In contrast, antigenic shifts are responsible for much more serious pandemics, as exemplified by three widespread influenza outbreaks in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2) that caused tens of millions of deaths around the globe. In this century, a global pandemic of H1N1 influenza began in April 2009. Although the exact series of genetic re-assortment events that led to the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 subtype remains undefined, it is clear that a progeny virus emerged with a hemagglutinin protein to which much of the human population was immunologically na\u00efve. This antigenic shift combined with modern air travel allowed the novel influenza virus subtype to spread very rapidly and efficiently around the world. The potential severity of the situation caused the World Health Organization to issue a global alert, stating that the event was a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.\u201d Fortunately, the mortality associated with this outbreak was far less than in previous pandemics, with global fatalities estimated in the tens of thousands rather than millions. Significantly, older individuals who had survived one or more of the 20th century pandemics appeared to be immune or at least somewhat resistant to the 2009 H1N1 virus. The mechanism mediating this type of cross-subtype protection after an antigenic shift is not well understood. Some immunologists believe that previous infection with the 1918 virus (for example) may have invoked some degree of long-lived protection based on immune responses to more highly conserved proteins in the virus core, such as the viral nucleoprotein or matrix protein. This hypothesis remains under investigation.",

For example, humans naturally resistant to S. mansonii express high levels of Th2 cytokines, whereas individuals susceptible to this worm exhibit increased concentrations of Th1 cytokines. The antihelminth Th2 response involves IgE, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils, a combination that does not contribute significantly to defense against any other type of pathogen. Activated CD4+ T cells are also critical for antihelminth defense because these cells differentiate into effectors supplying the Th2 cytokines and CD40L contacts required for isotype switching to IgE by B cells (Fig. 13-5, #1\n). The antiparasite IgE antibodies synthesized by the B cells enter the circulation and \u201carm\u201d mast cells and basophils by binding to cell surface Fc\u03b5RI. When a worm antigen engages the cell-bound IgE, the degranulation of the mast cells and basophils is triggered in close proximity to the parasite (#2). Histamine released by the mast cells and basophils causes the contraction of host intestinal and bronchial smooth muscles such that the parasite is shaken loose from its grip on the mucosal surface and expelled from the body. Histamine and other proteins synthesized by mast cells and basophils are also directly toxic to some helminth parasites. In addition, the vasodilation and increased vascular permeability induced by histamine allow an influx of leukocytes and circulating antibodies into the area. Circulating IgE directed against worm surface molecules may bind directly to the pathogen, attracting the attention of eosinophils expressing Fc\u03b5RI molecules. The binding of the worm-bound IgE to eosinophil Fc\u03b5Rs triggers eosinophil degranulation and the release of substances that work directly and indirectly to kill the worm (#3). Some molecules degrade the skin of the worm, allowing neutrophils and other leukocytes to penetrate into its underlying tissues. These cells may also degranulate and release additional toxic proteins and peptides that kill the worm. Other molecules contained in eosinophil granules stimulate mast cells to degranulate.",

Large numbers of basophils, eosinophils and mast cells accumulate at the bite site to repel both the attacking bacteria and the tick.

(2010) Trends in Parasitology 26, 137\u2013144.Although unpleasant to deal with for both patient and physician alike, infection by the pork cestode intestinal tapeworm Taenia solium is relatively easy to diagnose, and adult worms that have evaded immune destruction are usually eliminated with antihelminthic medications. A much more serious condition arises when tapeworm cysts lodge in non-intestinal tissues such as the muscle, eye or brain. This condition, known as cysticercosis, can be extremely difficult to diagnose and may cause significant tissue damage. Arguably the most severe form of cysticercosis is neurocysticercosis (cysts in the brain), which can result in convulsions, permanent brain damage, or death. Neurocysticercosis caused by T. solium is the most common parasitic disease of the CNS worldwide, and early and accurate diagnosis of this infection could significantly reduce its global morbidity and mortality. This article by Deckers and Dorny reviews the numerous laboratory tests currently available and under development for the diagnosis of various forms of cysticercosis. The authors also describe several candidate T. solium molecules that may prove useful for the development of future diagnostic tools. Most of these tests are immunologically based and include techniques such as radioimmunoassay, hemagglutination, complement fixation, and ELISA.

These PAMPs include fungal \u03b2-glucans, chitins, mannans and oligomannosides. In particular, Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 are CLRs specialized for the recognition of fungal PAMPs. Dectin-1 binds to cell wall \u03b2-glucans, whereas Dectin-2 recognizes mannose structures common to the hyphal forms (only) of many fungi.

This signaling results in host cell production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leukotrienes instrumental in removing the invader. Dectin-1 is widely expressed on DCs, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and some T cells. Dectin-2 expression is more restricted, being limited to monocytes and macrophages. The importance of Dectin-1 has been highlighted by recent studies of a family in Holland, some members of which lack Dectin-1 expression and suffer from recurrent fungal infections.

Host cell-derived DAMPs associated with fungal infections include the S100 proteins that bind to RAGE, a PRR introduced in Chapter 3. As was true for protozoan parasites, animals lacking expression of the TLR signaling adaptor protein MyD88 are very vulnerable to fungal infections. Neutrophils and macrophages activated by PRR engagement carry out vigorous phagocytosis and produce powerful antifungal defensins that induce osmotic imbalance in the fungal cells (Fig. 13-6, #1\n). Fungal cells may also trigger their own engulfment by some cell types that are not normally phagocytic, including epithelial and endothelial cells. As well as defensins, activated neutrophils and macrophages secrete copious quantities of chemokines along with IL-1, IL-12 and TNF, which are directly toxic to fungal cells. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells appear to play a significant role in antifungal defense at the mucosae (#2), a hypothesis based on the fact that mice engineered to lack \u03b3\u03b4 T cells show increased susceptibility to yeast infections. Activated NK cells stimulated by the presence of IL-12 contribute to fungal cell killing via TNF secretion (rather than by natural cytotoxicity) (#3). IFN\u03b3 produced by NK cells contributes to macrophage hyperactivation that can eventually lead to granuloma formation.NOTE: Expression of SNPs of many of the molecules associated with antifungal responses, including TLRs, CLRs, cytokines and chemokines, leads to increased susceptibility to fungal infections. For example, a TLR2 SNP that results in increased TNF production but decreased IL-18 and IFN\u03b3 secretion by leukocytes is associated with more severe C. albicans infections. Similarly, TLR4 and TLR9 SNPs have been linked to Aspergillus infections of the lungs. SNPs in Dectin-1 and NLRP3 that impair cytokine production leave the host vulnerable to fungal infections of the mucosae and/or skin. Likewise, SNPs in MBL or MASP that alter the lectin-mediated complement activation pathway allow Aspergillus to set up shop, as do SNPs in TNF or TNFR1/2 that decrease their expression. Interestingly, SNPs in IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 that increase production of these cytokines can dysregulate the adaptive response so much that fungal invasion succeeds. Clinicians may soon be able to use all these SNPs as genetic markers to identify patients who are at high risk for developing fungal diseases if their immune systems are deliberately suppressed. Preventive treatment can then be offered to these individuals.\n",

These T cells secrete the copious quantities of IFN\u03b3 needed to complete macrophage hyperactivation (Fig. 13-6, #4). DCs whose MRs and Dectin-1 molecules are engaged by fungal PAMPs are stimulated to produce IL-23 and IL-10, which initiate the generation of Th17 effectors. These cells contribute mainly to protection against fungi attempting to colonize the mucosae, including C. albicans and some Aspergillus species. Antifungal Th17 cells secrete IL-17 and IL-22 that contribute to the neutrophil recruitment and proliferation crucial for fungal clearance, and support Th1 responses.

Antibody-mediated opsonization may promote phagocytosis (Fig. 13-6, #5) and thus contribute to the clearance and presentation of fungal antigens. However, antibodies produced by a unique B cell subset called B-1 cells are critical for antifungal defense. In Chapters 4 and 5Chapter 4Chapter 5, we described conventional B cell production of antibodies of the IgM, IgG, IgA and IgE isotypes in response to antigen. However, the serum of normal healthy individuals contains IgM antibodies that are pre-existing and generated without the apparent need for exogenous antigen. These proteins, which are called natural antibodies, are produced by B-1 cells scattered in the body\u2019s periphery rather than concentrated in the bone marrow or secondary lymphoid tissues. Many natural antibodies are specific for the \u03b2-glucans and chitins in fungal cell walls.\nNOTE: There is a fine balance that must be maintained during inflammatory responses to fungi to ensure host health. Acute inflammation is helpful in getting rid of the invader, but chronic inflammation that fails to clear the pathogen appears to encourage fungal persistence. Severe fungal infections can occur in patients who have started to recover function of their immune systems after immunosuppression has been used to allow transplantation, or after AIDS has been brought under control by anti-HIV drug therapy. These individuals sometimes show clinical signs of a disease labeled immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). As the immune system starts to reconstitute itself, it mounts an excessive inflammatory response to an opportunistic pathogen such as a fungus that has taken hold during the immunosuppression. Rather than resolving the infection, this inflammation disrupts immune system regulation and compromises fungal clearance, paradoxically making the condition worse.\n",

In the next chapter of this book, we discuss the \u201cmanufactured\u201d immunity to pathogens created by vaccination.Chapter 13 Take-Home Message\n\u2022There are six major types of pathogens: extracellular bacteria, intracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi and prions.\u2022Innate immunity mediated by neutrophils, NK cells, NKT cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, complement and microbicidal molecules either foils the establishment of infection or slows it down until adaptive immune mechanisms can target the pathogen more effectively.\u2022The adaptive elements that will be most effective depend on the nature of the pathogen: extracellular versus intracellular, small versus large, fast- versus slow-replicating.\u2022Most extracellular entities can be coated in antibody and cleared by antibody- and complement-mediated mechanisms. Parasitic worms are targeted by IgA and IgE antibodies that prevent the worm from anchoring in the host. IgE can trigger the degranulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils and the release of mediators that work to expel the worm and degrade its tissues.\u2022Intracellular bacteria and parasites and replicating viruses must be eliminated by cell-mediated immunity. CTLs, NK cells, NKT cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells secrete cytotoxic cytokines and/or carry out target cell cytolysis. Macrophage hyperactivation and granuloma formation may be needed to confine persistent invaders.\u2022In general, Th1 and Th17 responses support cell-mediated immunity against internal threats, whereas Th2 responses are needed for humoral responses against external threats.\u2022Many pathogens have evolved complex strategies to evade the immune response: avoiding recognition; antigenic variation; avoiding or inactivating phagocytosis; shedding or inactivating complement components; acquiring host RCA proteins; cleaving host FcRs; inducing host cell apoptosis; and manipulating the host\u2019s immune response or cell cycle.\n\nDid You Get It?

Some Conceptual Questions\n1)We noted in this chapter that a subset of B lymphocytes known as B-1 cells produces \u201cnatural antibodies\u201d that are of the IgM isotype only and circulate in the periphery prior to antigen exposure. Keeping the idea of pattern recognition in mind, how might you argue that, despite being produced by B lymphocytes, these antibodies are actually part of the innate immune response to pathogens?2)In many influenza epidemics and pandemics throughout history, those people who became most seriously ill or died were either the very young, the very old, or those who were immunocompromised in some way. In contrast, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization noted the following:a)Those who became seriously ill were often young adults in otherwise good health.b)Respiratory failure and shock were common causes of death.\nHow might differences in immune responses to different influenza strains explain these observations?3)If you were a nefarious individual attempting to create an intracellular pathogen that could prevent the most effective immune responses directed at it by the host, what mature cell type would you design the pathogen to infect and disable?\n\n",

These cells initiate phagosomal killing and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. (3) NK cells activated by IL-12 kill infected host cells by natural cytotoxicity and secrete IFN\u03b3. (4) Bacterial phosphorylated metabolites activate \u03b3\u03b4T cells. (5) CTLs recognizing bacterial peptides presented by an infected host cell kill it by releasing toxic granule contents and/or cytokines. (6) Infected DCs present bacterial peptides on MHC class II to CD4+ T cells, which generate Th1 effectors in the presence of IL-12. These Th1 cells supply cytokines for the CTL response and macrophage hyperactivation.

(2) Activated NK cells secrete cytokines and kill infected host cells that fail to express sufficient peptide-MHC class I. (3) Activated macrophages efficiently capture and kill viruses, and produce NO and cytotoxic cytokines. (4) Infected DCs, or those that have captured virions or viral products, activate CD4+ T cells, which reciprocally license DCs for Tc cell activation. (5) Antiviral CTLs kill virus-infected host cells by Fas killing, cytotoxic cytokines, or perforin/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity. (6) Antibodies bound to a viral antigen on the surface of an infected host cell may engage FcRs on an NK cell, macrophage, or neutrophil and trigger ADCC or opsonized phagocytosis. If the bound antibody binds to C1, classical complement activation can lead to MAC-mediated destruction of the infected cell.
