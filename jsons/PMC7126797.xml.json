Until recently, available information on childhood morbidity was derived from clinics and hospital records. However, information obtained from hospitals represents only a small proportion of all cases, since many other cases do not seek medical attention (Black, 1984). Thus, the hospital records may not be appropriate for estimating the prevalence of diarrhoea for program developments (Woldermicael, 2001).",

            "text": "Policy-makers and researchers often want to know the distribution of a disease prevalence by geographical region, or association with environmental factors (Diggle, Moyeed, & Thomson, 2002; Thomson, Connor, Milligan, & Flasse, 1996). In this regard, mapping risk variations in child morbidity is an invaluable tool. Further, the mapping of variation in risk of childhood morbidity can help improve the targeting of scarce resources for public health interventions. Therefore, Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful tool for public health practitioners that can easily allow them to assess patterns, trends and relationships between health events and environmental, socio-economic and other geographic factors (see for instance the case of disease surveillance, preparedness and response coordination to combat health threats such as West Nile virus, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bioterrorism (Gardner & Harrington, 2003)). GIS further helps us to understand childhood disease prevalence at the community level (see for instance Garg, Omwomo, Witte, Lee, & Deming, 2001; Mbonye (2003), Mbonye (2004)) and helps to identify underserved populations, and can help public health agencies to efficiently allocate scarce program resources to appropriate locations. For example, the Communicable Disease Control Division of the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) uses GIS to help identify at-risk populations and determine where to focus efforts to vaccinate residents against influenza. This paper is based on a study of the spatial distribution of childhood diarrhoea and fever in Malawi. The study applied Bayesian statistical and geo-statistical techniques to the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data of Malawi with location (district) attributes and other information to answer specific questions about geographic inequalities in childhood disease prevalence. The DHS in Malawi conducted in 2000 is a valuable resource for population-based morbidity data, although we recognize its limitation, like other DHSs elsewhere, in that it relates only to reported child morbidity during the last 2 weeks before the survey. Thus, our results might be influenced by the effects of seasonality in diseases prevalence.",

With a gross national product (GNP) of US$ 170/person/year, Malawi is among the 20 least economically developed countries in the world (National Statistical Office [Malawi] and ORC Macro, 2001; WHO, 1998). Agriculture accounts for over a third of the GNP, about 90 percent of export earnings and approximately three-quarters of total employment (UNICEF and Government of Malawi, 1993). Despite economic difficulties Malawi has invested a lot in health. According to UNICEF statistics there is a reasonably good network of health facilities in Malawi (the median distance from home to the nearest facility is 5 km). For 90 percent of births, mothers have received at least one antenatal care from a trained health worker, and 86 percent of children aged 12\u201323 months possess a health card indicating a high under-five clinic attendance and about 90 percent of children are reported to have been vaccinated against the most common illnesses. However, improvements in health indicators have been smaller than expected. Currently, the maternal mortality rate is estimated at 1120\u20131180/100,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth is only 44 years, largely because of high mortality amongst the children. For every 1000 live births, about 135 die before the age of 1 year and 200 before the age of 5 years (National Statistical Office [Malawi] and ORC Macro (2001). Findings of the 2000 MDHS point to important changes in Malawi's health and demographic profile. Mortality of children under age 5 has declined since the early 1990s. During the period 1988\u20131992, the under-five mortality rate was 234 deaths/1000 live births, compared with 189/1000 between 1996\u20132000 (National Statistical Office [Malawi] and ORC Macro (2001). Although this represents important progress, the rate of the downward trend is modest and childhood mortality remains at a very high level. A comparison of the 1992 and 2000 Malawi DHS shows that the prevalence of diarrhea decreased slightly from 20% to 17% between the two periods. However, the percentage of ill children who received treatment reduced. All these point to the fact that Malawian children are growing up in an environment of high morbidity, low utilization of health care, and consequently high mortality risks.",

Household socio-economic status is associated with child survival because it determines the amount of resources (such as food, good sanitation and health care) that are available to infants (Millard, 1994). Measures of socio-economic status that are thought to be associated with infant heath include: maternal and paternal education; household wealth; household size; parental occupation; and rural or urban residence. Kandala and Madise (2004), who used the 1992 DHS data from Malawi and Zambia, in their study of childhood morbidity, found that the level of maternal education was highly significant in the two countries. They also found that childhood morbidity was lower among educated women, and that although this effect attenuated with the inclusion of other socio-economic factors in the models, maternal education remained significant.",

The impact of the household's size should, however, not be over-interpreted, since to some extent it directly mirrors infant mortality. For instance, a household with high mortality risk will remain small. In contrast, a household's size might also reflect its wealth, as a rich household will attract occupants. Again, in a large household, a child might benefit from the help of several adults. Large households may benefit from scale economies in time for childcare as well as in expenditures. Alternatively, they may have become better at raising children through accumulated experience (Christianensen & Alderman, 2001).",

Exceptions have been noted in some Asian countries. In India, girls are more than 30 percent likely to die before their fifth birthday than boys and this is thought to be the result of son preference, which is manifest in lower spending on health for girls and higher prevalence of immunization among boys (Claeson, Bos, Mawji, & Pathmanthan, 2000; Timaeus, Harris, & Fairbarn, 1998).",

In this paper, we take advantage of advances in GISs and how the technology provides opportunities to study associations between environmental exposure and the spatial distribution of diseases. Jacquez (2000) discusses how GIS can be used to monitor disease outcomes, identify health risks, and design and implement intervention plans. The epidemiological approach has not yielded all the answers, but it holds great merit and much potential to further contribute to the knowledge of disease etiology. This study enhances our understanding of diarrhoea and fever prevalence in a dimension that could not have been possible prior to the availability of GIS. The results will help us making further decisions in planning for diarrhoea and fever research.",

Geo-additive logistic models were used (on the probability of a child having diarrhoea and fever during the reference period) to determine the socio-economic and demographic variables that are associated with the ailments while simultaneously controlling for spatial dependence in the data and possible nonlinear effects of covariates. The DHS data have been collected hierarchically at the family and community levels which are inter-related. Standard analysis of the fixed effects covariates for child morbidity neglects this correlation structure and dependence in the data. This neglect leads to underestimation of standard errors of the fixed effects that inflates the apparent significance of the estimates (Bolstad & Manda, 2001). Our analysis includes this correlation structure and account for the dependence of community in the model. The model also permitted borrowing strength from neighbouring areas to obtain estimates for areas that may, on their own, have inadequate sample sizes. This gives more reliable estimates of the fixed effect standard error.",

This is done jointly in one estimation procedure that simultaneously identifies socio-economic determinants, and the spatial effects that are not explained by these socio-economic determinants. In this way, we are able to identify district patterns of prevalence of diarrhoea and fever that are either related to socio-economic variables that are not in the model and that have a clear spatial pattern, or point to spatial (possibly epidemiological or environmental) processes that account for these spatial patterns. Identifying spatial patterns of disease prevalence beyond the known family socio-economic determinants should also assist in poverty mapping and associated district targeting of resources (Elbers et al., 2001).",

The geographical information given in Table 1 (or right panel of Fig. 1) is highly aggregated and conceals local and district specific effects. On the other hand, diarrhoea prevalence by districts in Table 1 (or Fig. 2) strongly depended on the sample size and may be rather unstable. Smoothing techniques were used to stabilize the observed prevalence in the sample as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2.",

Fig. 4, Fig. 7 show the effect of child's age on diarrhoea and fever in Malawi and Fig. 5, Fig. 8 show the effect of mother's age on the two ailments. Shown are the posterior means together with 95% CIs. For comparison a regression line obtained by a linear fit is added to the plot. While the effect of the variable \u201cmother's age\u201d is almost linear for both ailments, its effects on the variable \u201cchild's age\u201d are clearly nonlinear. The linear model assumes a negative relationship between mother's age at child's birth and risk of diarrhoea or fever, and between child's age and risk of diarrhoea and fever. As we show in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, this glosses over important nonlinearity in the effects. The data suggest deterioration in child diarrhoea that sets in right after birth and continues, more or less linearly, until 12 months of age. This immediate deterioration in child morbidity was not expected, as the literature commonly associates such deterioration with weaning at around 4\u20136 months. In a Kenyan study, children aged 1\u20132 years were the most vulnerable (Magadi, 1997). One reason for this unexpected finding could be that, according to the DHS surveys, most parents gave their children liquids other than breast milk shortly after birth, a factor which might contribute to infections. This is due to the influence of poor-quality nutrition that is replacing breast milk as well as the onset of infectious diseases. These diseases are often related to unclean water and food which is replacing the breast milk, and the child no longer benefits from the mother's antibodies that are transmitted through the breast milk (Stephenson, 1999). Initially, the worsening health status shows up as acute under-nutrition. But then childhood morbidity develops and worsens until about age 1. At that time, the body has developed its immune system to fight the impact of infectious diseases more effectively (Moradi & Klasen, 2000; WHO, 1995).",

The findings are generally as expected and consistent with the literature. Children of highly educated mothers or living in urban areas are at lower risk of fever than other children (Cleland & Sathar, 1984; Curtis & Steele, 1996; Hobcraft, McDonald, & Rutsein, 1985; Kandala, 2002; Madise, Banda, & Benaya, 2003). The higher rural fever risk is possibly due to the fact that rural areas in Sub-Saharan African are under-developed and have less public service per capita compared with urban areas (Brockerhoff, 1993; Kuate Defo, 1996). As a result, living in rural areas provides no access to beds with mosquito nets or better health care and increases the risk of malaria and fever. After we controlled for child, household, and districts characteristics the residential location (rural versus urban) does not affect child diarrhoea. The urban\u2013rural effect may be captured by the district effects. Furthermore, the lack of corresponding urban advantage with respect to diarrhoea may be partly attributed to growing urban poverty in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, which has been associated with poor sanitation in the densely populated slum settlements leading to increased incidence of diarrhoea among children of the urban poor (Magadi, 2003).",

The interpretation of fever in this report should take into account the fact that the DHS surveys are (for logistical reasons) mostly conducted in the dry, least malarious season (Africa Malaria Report, WHO, 2003). In addition, the observed prevalence of diarrhoea can be considered as incidence rate of diarrhea. Because of the short follow-up period of 2 weeks before the interview, we have ignored the role of competing risk, although diarrhoea may be present in different forms: persistent diarrhoea (more than 14 days), acute watery diarrhoea, or dysentery (blood in stool). Other diseases that can occur concurrently with diarrhoea include measles and malaria. Malnutrition also often accompanies diarrhoea.",

It is possible that health care utilization is a reflection of accessibility of health care services and has been captured by the spatial effects in the multivariate analysis. Also vaccination status turns out to be statistically insignificant, although other studies in rural sub-Saharan Africa have reported immunization status of a child as an important factor associated with diarrhoea (see for instance Mbonye (2003), Mbonye (2004)). It should be noted that in the DHS, the reliability of parental recall of vaccination status for vaccines given to infants has not been studied and it is therefore unknown and may affect these results.",

Thus, most of the rural households will be in the lowest wealth category even if they have other indicators of wealth (e.g. livestock or farm machinery). The consequence of this misclassification would be to lower the risk of childhood diseases of rural households. Another limitation with household wealth indices derived from DHS is that they are based on current status data so that they might not capture the true level of household wealth during the infancy of children born several years before the survey. However, since these analyses are restricted to births within 5 years of the survey, this bias will not be substantial.",

Moreover, the measure of disease prevalence used here, recall of whether a child had been ill with diarrhoea or fever in the past 2 weeks is less perfect as it is quite subjective, based on a short-term recall.

For instance, the age effect suggests the need to pay attention to child feeding practices, particularly during the first 6 months after birth. Second, the nonlinear influence of mother's age indicates that childcare promotion messages should be targeted particularly to younger parents. Of high significance are the district influences on child morbidity. In particular, they suggest that in Malawi, some urban agglomerations are associated with higher risk of diarrhoea. Also, more emphasis must be placed upon the role of remoteness as well as climatic and geographic factors on childhood morbidity. It would be of value to investigate district-level factors not included in our models, such as environmental, socio-economic, cultural and human behavioural factors involved in the etiology of the disease. The North-Central divide in Malawi highlights the importance of such considerations.",
