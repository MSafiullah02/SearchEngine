We used a recently described PCR-based 27 assay that targets 3 conserved CFPHV genes, to survey 208 green turtles 28 green turtles yielded CFPHV sequences, surprisingly, so did 15% of the 46 clinically healthy turtles.

This domain was modelled without the use of a template from PDB 161 due to lack of them. The solvent accessibility for the reference amino acid was 162 labelled as buried (53.6%), medium (36.6%), and exposed (10.1%). The 163 alternative amino acid also was placed in a beta structure with 81.3% (4.3% 164 as helix and 14.2% loop) according to the labelling of the whole sequence 165 almost entirely modelled using a template from PDB (93% of the residues 166 were modelled using a template, the alternative Y amino acid included). In the 167 3D domain predicted from PDB templates with a p value of 1.31 e-02 100Y fell 168 at the end of a loop, right before the beginning of a beta. The solvent 169 accessibility for Y was labelled as buried (48%), medium (38.2%), and 170 exposed (13.9%). The predicted structures of the reference and the sequence 171 associated with the radical amino acidic substitution were different, with the 172 first predicting two domains and the later predicting three domains (See Fig.  173   1D) .

Detailed list of haplotype sequence SNPs per marker can be found 135 in Additional file S3. The final 98 nucleotide alignment of the 58 sequences for 136 UL18 locus exhibited five different variable sites (position 6 R, position 12 Y, 137 position 40 Y, position 69 R and position 78 R). The 132 nucleotide alignment 138 of the 95 sequences for UL22 locus contained two variables sites (position 42 139 R and position 90 W).

Moreover, some oncogenic herpesviruses induce tumour 196 formation in specific tissues [13], while being absent in other tissues of the 197 same individual. Thus, CFPHV DNA may be very unequally distributed within 198 same animal with large concentrations of viral DNA in the affected tissue only. 199 Given this, it is not surprising that CFPHV viral DNA sequences were detected 200 in 100% of FP tumours. Although only 88% of the samples derived from non-201 tumour areas of FP exhibiting turtles were CFPHV positive, this is also 202 unsurprising -while in the active viraemic phase, herpesvirus DNA is prone to 203 be detected throughout the body, it is likely that in chronic infections viral 204 activity may be confined to nervous tissue [27, 28] and tumour sites. 205 Lastly, in the globally distributed samples of clinically healthy individuals 206 belonging to 5 species of sea turtles, the average detection rate was 207 substantially lower; 15%. While we observed a great variation in the ratio of 208 infected individuals in the populations investigated, nearly all sea turtle 209 populations analysed counted some individuals carrying CFPHV (see Fig. 210 1A), which seems to support the panzootic status of FP [5, 29]. Excluding 211 location samples from which only a single individual was analysed (e.g. 212 loggerhead sample from Northern California or green turtle from Danish 213 aquarium); unique exceptions seem to be grouped in samples originated from 214 Kuwait, Dubai and Oman in the Arabian Gulf and Northern Indian Ocean, as 215 well as hawksbill turtles from Puerto Rico which remained CFPHV free in our 216 global PCR analysis (see Fig. 1A). This could indicate that the specific turtle 217 populations in these areas could be resistant to CFPHV and/or suggest that 218 certain environmental conditions possibly in combination with immune system 219 modulators may influence the persistence and severity of the disease [5, 30-220 33]. There are no historic records for turtles exhibiting FB tumours for the 221 entire Arabian Gulf region, nor for the hawksbill population in Puerto Rico. 222 However, CFPHV presence was detected in three-hawksbill turtles from 223 Kuwait. Thus, apparently CFPHV-free turtle populations should be observed 224 individually and not as a regional phenomenon. There is no genetic data 225 available for green turtles nesting at Qaru Island in Kuwait, however, satellite 226 telemetry data suggests this population derive from a larger stock nesting in 227 Saudi Arabia [34]. In order to analyse the large geographical distribution of 228 Masirah Island's loggerhead population, a total of 34 turtle individuals were 229 collected over 80 kilometres coastline from the Omani population. This 230 population stock in combination with the rest of the Indian Ocean has been 231 estimated to be second largest loggerhead population in the world [35, 36], as 232 well as possessing one of the unique haplotypes in their clade, which diverges 233 from the remaining Atlantic and Indian Ocean haplogroup IB lineages [37]. 234 Furthermore, it could also be that the sample size analysed did not fully 235 represent the actual CFPHV-turtle interaction structure. 236 Herpesviruses are frequently detected in tortoises and terrapins of zoological 237 collections mainly because of the advances in diagnostic methods, and 238 several species, mainly tortoise herpesvirus 1 to 4 (THV1-4), have been 239 reported and characterized [30, 38-40]. As our PCR primers used were all 240 based on published sequences of conserved genes [2, 41] in the CFPHV 241 genome, we speculated they may potentially anneal successfully to related 242 herpesviruses. However, a preliminary result from a small data set of 11 DNA 243 extracts derived from 9 different species of tortoises and terrapins (Additional 244 files S3 and S5) yielded no positive results. Whether this indicates that 245 CFPHV is unique to sea turtles, or that tortoise and terrapin herpesvirus is too 246 divergent for the primers to bind to remains uncertain, and warrants future 247 investigation. 248 Herpesviruses are well known to be transmitted horizontally from one infected 249 organism to the other by direct physical contact via saliva, mucus, blood or 250 semen [2]. Viral particles can also be transported and survive in salt water for 251 relatively short periods of time before the proteins in the virus capsid degrade. 252 This has been reported for the herpesvirus associated with lung-eye-trachea 253 disease (LETD) in sea turtles, which has been shown to survive in seawater 254 for about 2 weeks [42]. Sea turtles have been observed to develop FP 255 tumours as juveniles and it has been suggested that infection occurs in 256 feeding grounds where animals conglomerate in large numbers [7, 43]. It is 257 possible to hypothesize, therefore, that the transmission of the virus occurs 258 mainly during this period in the life cycle of sea turtles. Thus, animals may 259 either develop infection or simply remain passively infected in latency while 260 viral DNA establishes into the animal tissue for the rest of their life. Moreover, 261 we speculate that severity of infection may depend on co-infections and the 262 immunological status of the individual animal, which also may explain why not 263 all animals in a population develop FP [29]. 264",

CFPHV sequences were detected only from six 274 females in this population; all offspring neonates resulted in zero prevalence. 275 While our data is not conclusive, future studies should examine the genetic 276 signature mother-offspring in viral disease transmission and tumour 277 development. 278 Amino acid variation in the Turks and Caicos population 279 From the different amino acid substitutions found in the haplotypes, only the 280 C>Y radical substitution at position 100 in the UL18 marker gene is of 281 potential functional importance. All other substitutions observed were either 282 conservative, or part of a loop. Although no high-resolution crystallographic 283 structure exists for the protein encoded by this gene, thus limiting the potential 284 for functional prediction, it was possible to use RAPTORX to predict structural 285 changes with other suitable templates.

            "text": "many proteins. On the other hand, the tyrosine has a phenol side chain group, 297 which allows it to receive a phosphate from kinases in signal transduction 298 cascades, changing the activity of the protein. Given that the function of the 299 major capsid protein is to protect the viral genome from damaging agents 300 such as proteolytic and nucleolytic enzymes, such an amino acidic change 301 could have functional as well as structural implications. 302 FP tumours have previously been reported for green turtles in Turks and 303 Caicos Islands (TCI's) [25], but no genetic characterization has been done of 304 the infected animals at this location. Mixed-stock analysis of conglomerating 305 green turtles from TCI's, have shown the mitochondrial haplotype CM-A3 as 306 the most common, a widespread haplotype in Caribbean rookeries, including 307Costa Rica (Tortuguero), Florida and Mexico [25]. Thus indicating that TCI's 308 green turtle aggregations receive important contributions from all over the 309 Caribbean. However, there is no evidence suggesting a genetic flow between 310 these and populations from far Northeast or from the other side of the Atlantic 311 e.g. in Portuguese waters. Both haplotype and amino acids characterization 312 performed in this study indicate a unique genetic signature for the CFPHV in 313 TCI's, shared only by one sample originated in Portugal, which may suggest 314 this virus strain has spread across the Atlantic. It is important to notice that all 315 turtles from TCI's containing this virus strain were FP exhibiting, while the 316 unique turtle from Portugal was a clinically healthy animal with no signs of 317 disease. Furthermore, the amino acid substitution described for UL18 gene 318 may as well suggest an important protein structure modification that could 319 potentially result in the viral capsid being more resistant to the host immune 320 system. As has been shown before, even a single amino acid substitution can 321 be the cause of viral drug resistance and enhanced virulence [44-46]. Even322 though its positioning in the protein structure is based only on computational 323 modelling and the validity of its importance is subject to different conditions, 324 such as the amino acid being at least moderately exposed instead of buried, it 325 is worth noting it as a target for future deeper analysis with laboratory 326 experimental techniques. 327 Conclusions 328 Our data reveals the presence of CFPHV DNA within globally distributed 329 samples for all five species of sea turtle (See Fig. 1A-B). While the 100% 330 incidence of CFPHV in samples taken from tumour exhibiting green turtles is 331 in concordance with the findings of previous studies [21, 22, 42, 47], the key 332 new observation is a non-negligible prevalence among clinically healthy 333 animals of all 5 species. Surprisingly this yielded an average of 15% of 334 CFPHV infected individuals, and evidences the latent infectivity co-335 evolutionary process across virus and host. 336 While the frequency of infected individuals per turtle population varied 337 considerably, as well as the sample sizes studied, most global populations 338 contained at least one CFPHV positive individual. One notable exception is 339 that of the various turtle species populations from the Arabian Gulf and 340 Northern Indian Ocean, as well as hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) 341 from Puerto Rico, which were CFPHV free. We hypothesize that this may 342 suggest a possible environmental difference and/or genetic resistance in 343 these individuals. 344 Neighbour-joining trees and haplotype analysis were in agreement for 345 markers UL18, UL22 (See Fig. 1C); clustering CFPHV DNA sequences in 346 turtles from Turks and Caicos separate to all others, regardless of host 347 species or geographic origin. 348 Finally, computational analysis of amino acid radical substitution variants 349 within the Turks and Caicos samples suggest potential functional importance 350 in a substitution for marker UL18 (See Fig. 1D) that encodes the major capsid 351 protein gene. This could explain differences in pathogenicity as well as the 352 presence of different CFPHV genotypes present at different locations. Further 353 research is however advised in order to validate our suggested theory. 354 Methods 355 Samples 356 Tissue sampling design and protocols varied among the different 357 collaborators who provided samples from across the world. Overall, 398 358 tissue samples from 337 individual turtles of five species of sea turtles were 359 obtained, taken from skin, FP tumours or blood. Sample material obtained 360 were categorized into three different groups for analysis; 1) tumours from 361 turtles exhibiting FP, 2) any other type of tissue with macroscopic absence of 362 tumour (non-tumour) taken from FP exhibiting turtles; and 3) any type of 363 tissue or blood from clinically healthy (not FP exhibiting) turtles. FP tumour 364 samples derived from three populations of green turtles: Hawaii in the Pacific, 365 Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean, and Principe Island off the Atlantic coast 366 of Africa. For other tissue samples from clinically healthy turtles (thus not FP 367 exhibiting) see details in Additional file S5. All samples were collected and 368 exported under CITES permits (host institute permit DK03). 369 Skin samples were preserved in either RNA later (Qiagen), DMSO 20% 370 saturated with NaCl or in 70-96-100% ethanol at -20 \u00b0C; blood samples were 371 preserved in PAXgene TM (Qiagen). 372 DNA extraction of skin and tumour samples 373 DNA was extracted from approximately 25 mg tissue using the DNeasy 374 Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the instructions of the manufacturer. 375 Samples were incubated with agitation for 24 h at 56\u00b0C. The samples were 376 then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 g to pellet any remaining cellular material 377 and the supernatant was transferred into a 2 ml DNeasy Mini spin column 378 placed in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 8,000 g. Finally 379 purified genomic DNA was eluted in 100 \u00b5l of Qiagen EB buffer. Extraction 380 blanks were included to monitor for contamination. 381 DNA extraction from blood samples 382 DNA was extracted from approximately 10-20 \u00b5l anticoagulated blood by 383 proteinase K digestion using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 384 Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. 385 Samples were incubated with agitation for 10 min at 56 \u00b0C. The samples were 386 then centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 g, ethanol 96% was added to each 387 sample and the supernatant was transferred into a 2 ml the DNeasy Mini spin 388 column placed in a 2 ml collection tube, and then centrifuged for 1 min at 389 8,000 g and washed two times with Qiagen AW1 and AW2 buffers and finally 390 purified genomic DNA was eluted in 200 \u00b5l of Qiagen AE buffer. Extraction 391 blanks were included to monitor for contamination. 392 PCR Assay 393 PCR protocol specifications from a recently developed PCR-assay (Alfaro-394 N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. submitted, Additional file S6) were followed. The assay uses 395 singleplex primers designed to target highly conserved regions for three 396 different genes [2, 41] in the herpesvirus genome (Glycoprotein B gene UL27, 397 Glycoprotein H gene UL22 and Mayor capsid protein gene UL18-UL19) 398 (primer sequences are listed in Additional file S7). To minimise the risk of over 399 estimating the prevalence, a conservative approach was taken with regards to 400 positive result acceptance. Firstly, all PCR results were confirmed through 401 repeating the PCR at least twice. Secondly, every positive viral amplicon 402 identified was confirmed by Sanger sequencing; any amplification that lacked 403 sequence verification was considered a false positive and excluded from the 404 analysis. 405 PCR amplicons of the expected size were purified using QIAquick columns 406 (Qiagen) following the manufacture's protocol, then sequenced in both 407 directions by the commercial service at Macrogen Inc., Europe. Negative 408 controls were included in each batch of PCR amplifications and next 409 sequencing reactions to detect contamination. 410 Data analysis 411 A total of 287 purified PCR amplicons were sequenced using BigDye v3.1 412 (Applied Biosystems, USA) and 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, 413 USA) at Macrogen Inc., Europe. 414 DNA sequences were edited and aligned using GENEIOUS PRO 6.1.7 415 (Biomatters Ltd.) to give a consensus sequence for each amplicon. 416 Thereafter, sequences were blasted against NCBI GenBank and assigned to 417 herpesvirus based on minimum 95% pairwise identity. For any BLAST result 418 yielding a lower identity, the sequence was manually re-checked, and 419 considered false positive if the sequence was not obviously derived from the 420 herpesvirus target and thus excluded from further analysis. Sequences were 421 truncated to alignments for each gene marker. MAFFT v6.814b as implemented 422 within GENEIOUS was used to align the sequences for each amplicon marker, 423 using a scoring matrix of 200PAM/k2, gap open penalty: 1.53 and offset 424 value: 0.123). 425 Haplotype analysis 426 Number of variable sites was determined and analysed for each alignment for 427 each gene short-fragment marker (UL18, UL22 and UL27). A neighbour-428 joining tree was generated for each target region using the Tamura-Nei model 429 to illustrate the genetic relationship between the different sequence samples. 430 Spatial distribution of virus strains was visualized by creating haplotype 431 networks using TEMPNET [48], an R-script for summarizing heterochronous 432 genetic data implemented in R version 3.0.2 [49] with RSTUDIO version 433 0.98.490. 434 Amino acid analysis 435 In order to identify any amino acid substitution that may have functional 436 implications between different virus haplotypes, the sequences from each 437 marker were aligned to the corresponding gene sequence downloaded from 438 NCBI GenBank, then translated in the corresponding frame using the 439 standard genetic code. Subsequently, the sequence structures of the marker 440 proteins with and without the amino acidic substitution were predicted with 441 RAPTORX [50] and the protein secondary structure in which the changed 442 amino acid fell was identified from the reported structure labelling for the 443 whole sequence as well as from the 3D model for the corresponding domain 444 when possible. RAPTORX refers to a domain in the sense of a model unit. 445",

Originally described in green 69 either from known FP infected animals, or from localized populations known to 95 be infected by the virus. Thus, the global viral prevalence in turtles that do not 96 exhibit tumours remains unknown. Furthermore, to date only a limited number 97 of studies have attempted to investigate amino acid substitutions within 98 CFPHV sequences, whether for determining phylogenetic relationships of 99 different CFPHV strains, or other use [23, 24]. 100 In this study, we used a recently validated PCR assay that targets three short 101 regions of conserved genes (Alfaro-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. submitted) within the 102 herpesvirus to provide insights into the prevalence and genetic variation of 103 CFPHV in tumour and non-tumour containing samples of sea turtles.
