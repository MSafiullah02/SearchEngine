            "text": "In 1990 Eisenberg and colleagues 4 identified that the survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest could vary widely between locations, simply due to inconsistent case definitions impacting on the numerator and denominator used in the calculations. The authors concluded that \"The absence of uniform definitions prevents meaningful intersystem comparisons, prohibits explorations of hypotheses about effective interventions, and interferes with the efforts of quality assurance.\" 4,p1249 It was in recognition of this problem that an international task force, with representation from major resuscitation bodies from around the world, developed guidelines for the uniform reporting of outcome data on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 5 The guidelines are referred to as the 'Utstein Guidelines' in recognition of the name of an ancient abbey in Stavangar, Norway -the Utstein Abbey -where the first meeting of the group was held in 1990. 5 These were followed by further 'Utstein' type guidelines, including: guidelines for reporting paediatric advanced life support in 1995 6 ; guidelines for in-hospital resuscitation in 1997\" 7 ; guidelines for uniform reporting of data from drowning in 2003 8 and more recently guidelines for reporting post-resuscitation care. 9 In April 2002 a task force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) met in Australia, to review the worldwide experience with the Utstein definitions and templates, and led to the revision of the core reporting template -which could be used for in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest reporting and for both adults and paediatric arrests. 10 More recently, with the growing recognition of the importance of the quality (depth and rate) of CPR performed on survival 11 , there have been calls for data on CPR quality to be included as a matter of standard practice on with all studies of cardiac arrest, in addition to being useful within quality improvement processes both inhospital and out-of-hospital. 12 Since 13 In an earlier paper, Cone et al had similarly expressed concern about the underuse of the Utstein template, thus: \"Six years after the release of the Utstein style for OOHCA research, fewer than 60% of OOHCA research articles actually use the style.\" 14 Similarly, Nurmi et al found that data collection of resuscitation attempts using definitions provided in the Utstein guidelines was performed only in 22% of Finnish hospitals. 15 Nonetheless, the development of standardised definitions and recommendations for data items to be reported gave hope for comparison of results between different emergency medical systems 16 17 as well as monitoring trends in performance within a single organisation. 18 The concept of the utility of outcome data for quality improvement and resource justification was recognised and led to the establishment of large regional / state-wide cardiac arrest registries in many locations around the world, including (but not limited to) Amsterdam 19 Despite these developments, there is still much to be understood as to why there is such 'tremendous variability in outcome' 13 between different EMS, to identify the impact of regional differences in patient and system characteristics 32 and identify (and test) strategies to maximise survival outcomes.",

However, there were only two papers found that directly investigated the effect of EMS system performance evaluation as an intervention, namely: The Olasveengen, 2007, 427 (LOE 3, quality fair) before-and-after intervention study sought to test the hypothesis that providing information about CPR performance to the training teams of three different ambulance services would facilitate local education and improve CPR quality. Overall, there was no statistically significant differences between the periods before and after the CPR performance based evaluation (CPR_PE) intervention in any of the CPR quality components analysed. However, whilst not reaching statistical significance there was potentially clinically important improvement in the % correct depth of compression (35% versus 51%, p=0.12) and a reduction in the percentage of compressions that were too shallow (51% versus 40%). The authors concluded that the \"quality of CPR was not improved probably because of an inadequate implementation strategy\" and advise that \"bringing about changes in established practice likely requires a well thought-through implementation plan, addressing current barriers and giving sufficient time for repeated performance evaluations documenting progress.\" Moreoever, they call for more research into evidence based implementation strategies. 1 The Weydahl,1999,103 (LOE 4, Poor) paper is a case series study reporting (n=163) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes (arrests of presumed cardiac origin where resuscitation was attempted) in Ostfold county in Norway following the reorganisation of the EMS services. All out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Ostfold county in which the EMS system responded in 1997 were registered according to the Utstein template. The results were reported back to the EMS personnel and presented to the media. The authors reported a positive psychological effect on the ambulance staff thus: \"The Utstein registration also appears to have produced a feeling of unity among the personnel from the seven former EMS providers, and has played an important role in integrating the ambulance service into the emergency departments of the hospitals.\" Similarly, they report positive effects from the media presentation -which \"profiled the ambulance service in Ostfold as being of a good standard, and have helped to create popular confidence in a period with centralisation of emergency hospital functions.\" There was no examination of the effect of the feedback to the EMS personnel on resuscitation performance (eg CPR quality) or patient outcomes (ie survival).",

Results: Overall, there was no statistically significant differences between the periods before and after CPR_PE in any of the CPR quality components analysed. However, whilst not reaching statistical significance there was a potnetially clinically important improvement in the % correct depth of compression (35% versus 51%, p=0.12) and reduction in the percentage of compressions that were too shallow (51% versus 40%). No stat sig differences in survival (5% versus 2% -but only 2 cases in each). Conclusion: (from paper) Simply presenting the performance evaluation to CPR-instructors with emphasis on areas in need of improvement at the respective sites was clearly insufficient to improve their CPR quality. Leaving the sole responsibility of developing an implementation strategy to the respective CPR instructors gave little control over how the information was used. Limitations: (from paper) Quality of CPR was not improved probably because of an inadequate implementation strategy. Bringing about changes in established practice likely requires a well thought-through implementation plan, addressing current barriers and giving sufficient time for repeated performance evaluations documenting progress. The presence of committed and respected leaders focusing on areas in need of improvement is also believed to be important. As evidencebased medicine is increasingly demanded, more research is needed to give evidence based implementation strategies.Weydahl, PG, Stoen, AM, Jorgensen, B, et al.

The results were reported back to the EMS personnel and presented to the media.",
