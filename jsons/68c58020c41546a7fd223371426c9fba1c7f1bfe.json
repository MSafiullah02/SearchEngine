Nevertheless, for patients undergoing the most serious course and/or hospitalized, etiological investigation is important. When facing the possibility of a viral etiology, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) or ELISA tests are useful, although it must be considered that for adenovirus the sensitivity is not greater than 50% in most cases. DIF on incubated cells (shell-vial technique) yields better results. It is advisable to request this technique in cases having negative results with a high clinical suspicion. Currently, the amplification of specific viral genome fragments has a high sensitivity and specificity. It uses minimum quantities of DNA, with the simultaneous detection of multiple virus; it is easy to standardize, with quick results (8 h), and therefore it is very useful in hospitalized patients. When facing the possibility of a bacterial infection, hematic cultures have a low positive rate, so they are considered only for patients who show poor clinical response. In infants, hematic culture yields poorly (around 2%) but it is similar in older children (about 10%). In patients with pleural effusion, direct pleural space, Gram stain, and culture are less than 30% positive. Nevertheless, cytochemical analysis can help to precisely locate an empyema. In older children, Gram stain and expectoration culture may be useful when there are agents that differ from those that usually colonize the upper airway, particularly when its intracellular location corresponds to macrophages or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. To validate the sample, it is necessary to have at least 25 white blood cells and fewer than 25 epithelial cells per field. Serum antigen detection for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in blood, urine, or pleural effusion liquid has a low specificity and sensitivity, yielding false-positives in nasopharyngeal colonization or in patients who have recently received immunization, and therefore they are not recommended. The combination of urine antigen with acute-phase reactants may be a good predictor for bacterial pneumonia. The effectiveness of the immune complex for Streptococcus pneumoniae has shown better specificity and sensitivity to diagnose Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and for Chlamydia pneumoniae serum tests such as IgM are used. They have the limitation of allowing the diagnosis only after the first week, and therefore they are not useful for early diagnosis.",

Resistance is caused by mutations of penicillin protein-binding (PPB) sites, with a reduction in the protein affinity that binds to the antibiotic.

Important effects have been registered in relation to its prevention and suppurative complications after the incorporation of vaccines for type B Haemophilus influenzae. The national rate of invasive disease reported for 2003 was of 2.5/100,000 inhabitants, and the effectivity prevention for the bacterial community-acquired pneumonia and empyema was 80%. It must be considered that 6% to 16% of infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae are caused by noncapsulated agents against which the vaccine offers no protection. Influenza vaccine has a double effect: it reduces virus infection rate in high-risk populations, and, as a parallel effect, it decreases bacterial communityacquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, related to post-influenza virus infection. In Chile, when mandatory vaccination was introduced in 2000 for risk groups, pneumonia incidence was clearly reduced. For those children under 2 years old, 10-and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are less effective for preventing pneumonia (30%) than other invasive diseases such as sepsis and meningitis (97%). Both vaccines have a good immunogenicity and herd immunity. The 13-valent vaccine includes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9 V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F serotypes. Premature newborns, with chronic lung damage and other risk factors, must receive monoclonal antibody prophylaxis for syncytial respiratory virus.",

The etiological diagnosis cannot be done by X-ray studies, hemograms, or acute-phase reactants, so the development of materials for rapid diagnosis is an unmet need required to avoid the indiscriminant use of antibiotics, which is an important factor in the appearance of bacterial resistance. Penicillin derivatives, especially oral amoxicillin, continue to be the treatment of choice when Streptococcus pneumoniae is suspected; macrolides are used when a pneumonia caused by atypical agents is suspected, especially in schoolchildren more than 5 years old. Coverage with effective vaccines is important, according to the regional needs, which may contribute to the prevention of the disease. National programs, when systematically applied to have primary care coverage, have contributed to the significant decrease of morbidity and mortality.",
