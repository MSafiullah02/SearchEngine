Cultures were inoculated with either the postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)-associated strain Stoon-1010 or the abortion-associated strain 1121. Viral proteins were visualized and virus production was determined. In PK-15 cells, the capsid protein was expressed between 6 and 12 hours post inoculation (hpi), it relocated to the nucleus between 12 and 24 hpi. At that time, Rep protein was also detected in the nucleus. This sequence of events also occurred in FCM and PAM but nuclear localized antigens appeared later (48 hpi) and in a lower percentage of cells. In PAM, clear differences in susceptibility were seen between pigs. In PAM from two out of five tested pigs, nuclear localized antigens were not detected, whereas in PAM from three other pigs they were seen in up to 20% of the antigen-positive cells. Virus production was observed in PK-15 but not in PAM or FCM cultures. In a second study, the replication kinetics of seven different PCV2 strains were compared in PK-15 cells. It was shown that the two abortion-associated strains had a different replication kinetics in comparison with PMWS or porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome associated strains. With the abortion-associated strains, a higher number of infected cells was observed at 24 hpi and the percentage of infected cells with nuclear localised antigens was lower compared to that of other strains. 428 P.

PCV1 was first described by Tischer et al. [25] as a contaminant in the porcine kidney cell line PK-15. Experimental inoculations with this virus in susceptible pigs did not result in clinical signs or pathological lesions [2, 26] and as a result, PCV1 is generally recognised to be non-pathogenic. PCV2 was first isolated in 1997 from a piglet affected by the postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) [7] . More recently, this virus was also detected in aborted and stillborn foetuses [12, 31] . Experimental inoculations with PCV2 strain Stoon-1010 which was isolated from a case of PMWS [7] and with PCV2 strain 1121, isolated from aborted fetuses [17] have confirmed the crucial role of PCV2 in the reproduction of both syndromes [3, 21] .",

            "text": "The circovirus structure is characterised by its relative simplicity. The 1.8 kb single-stranded genome consists of a single circular ambisense DNA molecule [25] . Transcripts of 2 open reading frames have been characterized from PCV1infected cells. Open reading frame 1 (ORF1), situated on the viral DNA strand, is transcribed into two collinear transcripts: Rep and Rep' [14, 24] . Both proteins form a complex that is involved in the replication of the virion ssDNA replication [15] . Open reading frame 2 (ORF2), situated on the complementary DNA strand, codes for the capsid protein [19] which has a molecular weight of 30-35 kDa [5, 19] . In order to express the capsid protein, it is believed that the complementary strand has to be synthesized through the intermediate double-stranded replication form (RF) as described for geminiviruses [9, 28] . Since circoviruses do not code for their own DNA-polymerase for the production of the double-stranded RF, they depend on a host DNA-polymerase to complete replication of their genome. The requirement for host DNA-polymerases accounts for the observation that PCV1 requires PK-15 cells in the S-phase of the mitosis cycle to complete its infectious cycle [27] .",

Furthermore, indications for biological differences between PCV2 strains were found in the replication kinetics of the strains in PK-15 cells. PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells was studied as a reference and positive control for the full replication cycle of the virus. The earliest detectable viral protein in infected PK-15 cells was the capsid protein, which was mainly found in the perinuclear region of infected cells during the earliest stages of infection. Absence of immunofluorescence signal after inoculation with UV-inactivated PCV2 demonstrated that the early detected capsid protein was newly produced in the infected cell, rather than derived from captation of viral antigens from the inoculum. ORF2, which codes for the capsid protein, is located on the complementary strand of the virus' genome [19] and can thus only be transcribed from the double stranded replication form. The early expression of capsid protein in PK-15 cells suggests that the complementary strand was formed very shortly after infection of the cell, as has been described for monopartite geminiviruses [6] .",

Although Rep protein, like any other protein, has to be produced in the cytoplasm, it was immediately observed in the nucleus of the infected cell, indicative for a strong affinity for the nucleus. At present however, no nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been described for this protein. Double immunofluorescence stainings for both PCV2 capsid and Rep protein showed that most of the cells with nuclear localized PCV2 antigens contained both capsid and Rep. A low percentage of cells contained only Rep protein without expression of capsid (nuclear or cytoplasmic). This indicates that, although the capsid protein is the first viral protein detected in most of the infected cells, Rep protein can occasionally be the first expressed viral protein. The cellular or viral mechanisms that form the basis for this event remain to be elucidated. The fact that capsid protein was never found in the nucleus of an infected cell in the absence of Rep protein, although it can be abundantly present in the cytoplasm of that cell, suggests that the capsid interacts in some way with the Rep protein to cross the nuclear membrane. The inability of the capsid protein to reach the nucleus on itself in our study is surprising since Liu et al. [13] identified a nuclear localisation signal and detected the capsid protein in the nucleus upon transfection.",

In the present study, capsid protein was detected in the cytoplasm of a low percentage of macrophages (<1%). The number of positive cells increased in a time dependent manner. UV-inactivation of the inoculum resulted in absence of the immunofluorescence signal at any time after inoculation, indicating that the observed signal was due to expression of newly formed viral antigens. Limited numbers of infected macrophages (SWC3 + /41D3 + ) contained PCV2 antigens in their nucleus. The low number of macrophages showing this nuclear staining is comparable with the in vivo situation, where antigens are mainly found in the cytoplasm of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in PCV2 inoculated-piglets [23] . Macrophages with nuclear expression of PCV2 antigens were not described in previous studies [1, 8] , which can be explained by the differences in origin of the cells or in the inoculation dose or duration. In the present study, nuclear expression of viral proteins was observed in PAM originating from some specific piglets only.

The cell cycle dependency of PCV2 to complete its replication cycle is credited to the expression of DNA-polymerase expressed during the S-phase of the cell cycle [27] . Although macrophages do not divide, it has been shown that they can express high DNA polymerase activity in response to damage to their DNA [30] , an event which might be misused by PCV2 to complete its replication in these cells.",

At 24 hpi, 0.3% of the cells expressed viral antigens, a maximum of 1.8% viral antigen positive cells was reached at 48 hpi. Starting from 24 hpi, nuclear localized viral antigens were seen in up to 25% of the positive cells. Inoculation with strain 1121 resulted in viral antigen-positive cells detectable from 6 hpi and rapidly increasing in time to 1.8% at 24 hpi and a maximum of 3.0% at 48 hpi. Starting from 12 hpi, nuclear localised viral antigens were seen in 1-5% of the positive cells. Foci of infected neighbouring cells were seen starting from 36 hpi with both strains. Inoculation with UV-inactivated PCV2 resulted in the absence of a signal after staining with the polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies.

In FCM, a similar pattern was seen as in PK-15 cells although the percentage of viral antigen positive cells was approximately 10 times lower. In Stoon-1010 inoculated cell cultures, positive cells were detected from 24 hpi resulting in a limited number of cells expressing viral antigens in the nucleus at 48 hpi. Cell cultures inoculated with strain 1121 showed cytoplasmic positive cells starting from 6 hpi and nuclear positive cells starting from 36 hpi. For both strains, the number of positive cells was still increasing with both strains at 72 hpi. In PAM of one piglet, the number of viral antigen-positive cells increased in a time-dependent way from 0.03% at 12 hpi to 0.25% at 72 hpi with strain Stoon-1010 and from 0.22% at 6 hpi to 1.1% at 72 hpi with strain 1121. Up to 48 hpi, antigens were exclusively localized in the cytoplasm and the signal increased in intensity with time. The first nuclear localisation of viral antigens in PAM of this piglet was observed at 48 hpi (Stoon-1010) or at 72 hpi (1121). At 72 hpi, in Stoon-1010 inoculated cultures, 0.05% of the cells showed nuclear localized antigens (20% of the total number of positive cells) and in 1121 inoculated cultures, 0.03% of the cells showed nuclear localized antigens (3% of the total number of positive cells).

Some variation in the absolute numbers of infected cells was observed. Strain 1103, which is an abortion-strain from Canada, similar to strain 1121, showed similar replication kinetics as strain 1121. A rapid increase of cytoplasmic positive cells was observed during the first 24 hours of the experiment. The percentage of infected cells showing nuclear localization of viral antigens in 1103 infected cell cultures was comparable with 1121 (1% at 24 hpi) infected cell cultures and lower compared to cell cultures inoculated with PMWS or PDNS-associated PCV2 strains (\u226510% at 24 hpi).",
