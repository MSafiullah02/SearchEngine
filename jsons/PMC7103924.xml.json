Until June 2015, most of the cases of MERS-CoV infectors occurred in the Middle East, and recently, it is reported that South Korea has been sufferring from MERS. Symptoms may range from mild to severe, including fever, cough, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. Although the exact route of transmission is still unclear, the respiratory droplet route is currently most likely [6]. Although a few cases were reported in other countries, one was found in China in May 2015. A clinical research in combination with radiological findings was studied.",

Clinically, acute respiratory infection is the primary performance of MERS, accompanying with high fever (even reach to 39\u201340 \u00b0C), and sometimes with chills, shiver, cough, chest pain, headache, muscle and joint aches, fatigue, loss of appetite and so on. On the basis of pneumonia, the MERS rapidly developed into respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute renal failure. Diarrhea and other atypical clinical manifestations might occur to individual cases (such as immunodeficiency cases). In this study, the patient suffered from fever (up to 39.5 \u00b0C) and back pain firstly. After hospitalization for one week, his body temperature returned to normal (Fig. 2), but still being in cough with a small amount of yellow phlegm and a little bloodshot; and there is no shortness of breath at rest and oxygen therapy. On the sixth day after his hospitalization, MERS-COV was negative via the virological detection of sputum, and his body temperature had decreased to be normal, which indicated that the virus has a direct relationship with the fever. Laboratory tests found that the leukocytes count in the peripheral blood had decreased obviously since his hospitalization, and the count was about 3.00 \u00d7 109/L lasting for nine days, followed by increasing and till the 27th days it recovered to the normal level. This indicated that MERS-CoV mainly attacked human immune system, resulting in a significant reduce of leukocytes count; after the virus was cleared, the recovery may be a relatively slow process due to the leukocytes count recovered to the normal range for about two weeks after the virus return to be negative.",

Further chest X-ray examination showed large pieces of high density shadows in the middle right lower lung, oval pieces of high density shadows in the left lower lung field, and clear boundaries of the two upper lungs. 3) After the active antiretroviral therapy, the virus turned to be negative, the body temperature decreased to normal level (Fig. 2), and leukocyte count also began to rise (Fig. 3).
