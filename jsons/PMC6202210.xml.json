            "text": "Viruses in the Flavivirus genus cause substantial human disease. Innate immune control of these viruses is mediated by interferons (IFNs)3, which induce the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which encode antiviral effector proteins4. To identify genes that regulate the IFN response to a flavivirus, we used a genome-scale clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) approach to screen for single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that rendered cells permissive to infection with yellow fever virus expressing Venus (YFV-Venus) despite treatment with a highly suppressive dose of IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 1a). Multiple hits from the screen reconstituted the IFN signalling pathway, as expected, or were factors involved in mRNA processing (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Table 1). Comparing hits to our annotated list of 448 human ISGs revealed only three overlapping genes: IFI6 (encoding IFN-\u03b1-inducible protein 6) and two IFN signalling ISGs (STAT2, encoding signal transducer and activator of transcription 2, and IRF9, encoding IFN regulatory factor 9)4 (Fig. 1d). Aside from IFI6, which was among the most significant hits (P = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221213), no other classical ISGs were found with this analysis (Fig. 1d).",

            "text": "To confirm this result, we used two strategies to deplete IFI6 via CRISPR. In the first strategy, we used a puromycin-selectable lentiCRISPRv2 vector to deliver one sgRNA targeting IFI6 (IFI6-KO1). In the second strategy, we used both puromycin-selectable and blasticidin-selectable lentiCRISPRv2 vectors to co-deliver two distinct IFI6-targeted sgRNAs (IFI6-KO2) that were also different from the sgRNA in the IFI6-KO1 strategy. We generated an IFI6-knockout line, Huh7.5-IFI6-KO1, and showed loss of IFN-induced IFI6 expression by western blot (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1a). In infection studies, compared to control Huh7.5 cells, Huh7.5-IFI6-KO1 cells were markedly refractory to an otherwise robust IFN-mediated inhibition of West Nile virus expressing green fluorescent protein (WNV-GFP) (Fig. 1f) and YFV-Venus (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Similar results with YFV-Venus were obtained in two other cell backgrounds, A549-IFI6-KO1 and U-2 OS IFI6-KO1, and in Huh7.5-IFI6-KO2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1c\u2013e). To determine the effects of IFN-inducible IFI6 on a non-attenuated, non-reporter flavivirus, we assessed WNV titres in Huh7.5-NT (control cells expressing a non-targeting sgRNA) or in Huh7.5-IFI6-KO2 cells with or without IFN pre-treatment (Fig. 1g). In the absence of IFN, WNV replicated to similar titres in Huh7.5-NT and Huh7.5-IFI6-KO2 cells. IFN suppressed WNV replication by approximately 3 logs in Huh7.5-NT cells at 24 h and 48 h. At 72 h, the inhibitory effect was diminished and this correlated with decreased IFI6 expression by western blot. Notably, WNV titres were nearly completely restored at all time points in IFN-treated Huh7.5-IFI6-KO2 cells. To complement these IFI6 depletion studies, we also demonstrated that ectopically expressed IFI6 potently suppressed YFV-Venus in multiple cells types (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Time courses revealed potent and sustained IFI6-mediated inhibition of YFV-Venus and dengue virus expressing GFP (DENV-GFP) (Fig. 1h,i), as well as 2\u20133 log10 suppression of non-reporter YFV titres (Fig. 1j). Contemporary and prototype strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) were also inhibited by IFI6 (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Fig. 1g), although to a lesser extent than the other flaviviruses that we tested. These data establish a robust inhibitory phenotype for IFI6 against flaviviruses. In previous ectopic expression or short hairpin RNA knockdown screens, we and others also found IFI6 as inhibitory towards flaviviruses, further strengthening the reproducibility of the phenotype through multiple screening approaches4\u20137.",

            "text": "We next assessed the antiviral potential of IFI6 in more biologically relevant primary human cells. Ectopic expression of IFI6 suppressed ZIKV production in human fetal neural progenitors (Fig. 1l). IFI6 was robustly induced in both IFN-treated (Fig. 1m,n) and DENV-infected (Fig. 1o) primary normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). Despite poor replication of DENV in NHDFs, we observed enhanced DENV titres in CRIPSR-targeted NHDF-IFI6-KO1 cells relative to control cells (Fig. 1p). Similarly, when comparing WNV replication in NHDF-IFI6-KO2 cells relative to control NHDF-NT cells, we found that titres were 11-fold or 18-fold higher at 48 h or 72 h post-infection, respectively (Fig. 1q). Together, these data indicate that IFI6 is necessary for a robust anti-flavivirus IFN response, is sufficient to prophylactically suppress infection and can inhibit flavivirus replication in primary human cells.",

            "text": "Another screening hit, HSPA5, encodes BiP (also known as GRP78), a heat shock protein 70 chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that assists in protein folding and the surveillance of misfolded proteins10. We hypothesized that BiP may modulate the antiviral effects of IFI6. We first assessed IFI6 and BiP mRNA and protein levels in IFN-treated cells (Fig. 2a). As expected, IFI6 mRNA and protein were highly induced over a time course of IFN treatment. HSPA5 mRNA levels were largely unaffected by IFN, whereas BiP protein levels increased slightly at each time point after IFN treatment. To validate the CRISPR screen, we depleted BiP via CRISPR and found that YFV infection was de-repressed by more than fivefold in the presence of IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 2b). In the absence of IFN-\u03b1, we detected a modest 1.5-fold loss of infection in BiP-depleted cells, suggesting a minor role for this chaperone during YFV infection. We then knocked out BiP in cells ectopically expressing IFI6 and observed a similar (approximately fourfold) de-repression of YFV infection as with IFN-\u03b1 treatment (Fig. 2c). The antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 could be restored in BiP-depleted cells by complementing cells with sgRNA-resistant BiP (Fig. 2d). Notably, the depletion of BiP resulted in near-complete loss of ectopic IFI6 expression (Fig. 2e). These data indicate that, in the absence of BiP, IFI6 is targeted for degradation. This was confirmed by restoring IFI6 expression in BiP-depleted cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2f). To test whether BiP chaperone activity was required for its regulation of IFI6, we reconstituted BiP-depleted cells with CRISPR-resistant wild-type BiP or three ATPase-defective mutants11. The mutants could not rescue IFI6 levels (Fig. 2g), suggesting that BiP chaperone activity is required for IFI6 protein expression. To assess potential interactions between BiP and IFI6, we immunoprecipitated ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged IFI6 and found that BiP was indeed pulled down (Fig. 2h). The interaction was abrogated by ATP, which binds to the chaperone and induces a conformational change that releases substrates12. We next tested whether endogenous, IFN-induced IFI6 interacts with BiP. As our IFI6 antibody has a high background (Supplementary Fig. 1a), we used CRISPR-mediated \u2018gene tagging\u2019 to introduce a 3\u00d7FLAG epitope at the carboxy terminus of endogenous IFI6 in U-2 OS cells13. PCR with reverse transcription (RT\u2013PCR) and western blotting confirmed IFN-\u03b1-mediated induction of endogenous FLAG-tagged IFI6 (Fig. 2i). In a proximity ligation assay, we detected a robust interaction signal for BiP and IFI6 in IFN-treated gene-tagged cells (Fig. 2j and Supplementary Fig. 4a). Thus, BiP probably functions as a regulator of the IFN response to flaviviruses by facilitating proper folding and/or localization of IFI6 at the ER membrane.",

            "text": "The functional link between IFI6 and BiP, a lumenal ER chaperone, was unexpected as several reports indicate that IFI6 is a mitochondrial protein14\u201316. Thus, we sought to resolve IFI6 subcellular localization. The amino terminus of IFI6 has a predicted signal peptide (Supplementary Fig. 4b), suggesting targeting to the secretory pathway (ER, Golgi, vesicles, and so on). Indeed, the expression of IFI6 bearing a C-terminal 3\u00d7 FLAG epitope (IFI6-3\u00d7F) revealed a reticular staining pattern that overlapped with the ER translocon member Sec61\u03b2-GFP, but was distinct from mitochondria-localized GFP (Fig. 3a). As overexpression can mislocalize proteins, we assessed the localization of endogenous IFI6 in our gene-tagged cells (Fig. 2i). Immunofluorescence of IFN-treated, gene-tagged cells demonstrated a reticular pattern for endogenous IFI6 that overlapped with Sec61\u03b2-GFP (Fig. 3b) and was similar to ectopically expressed IFI6-3\u00d7F (Fig. 3a). Immunogold electron microscopy in COS-7 cells revealed that ectopically expressed IFI6 bearing a C-terminal haemagglutinin (HA) tag (IFI6-HA) localized extensively to cytosolic membranes that resembled ER structures, but not within nuclei or mitochondria (Fig. 3c). We confirmed by immunofluorescence that IFI6-HA staining in COS-7 cells was reticular and distinct from a mitochondrial GFP signal (Fig. 3d). Finally, we fused the putative N-terminal signal peptide of IFI6 to GFP and found that the signal from this fusion protein, (N32)IFI6-GFP, overlapped with the common ER epitope KDEL (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these results suggest that, contrary to previous reports, IFI6 is localized to the ER, the site of flavivirus replication.",

To test this, we monitored IFI6-3\u00d7F migration in a membrane flotation assay17,18. IFI6-3\u00d7F migrated to similar fractions as the ER integral membrane protein calnexin (Fig. 3f). Solubilization of membranes with Triton X-100 shifted the entire pool of IFI6 and calnexin to higher densities. By contrast, disrupting electrostatic interactions with a high salt concentration did not affect the migration pattern. Treatment with sodium carbonate (pH 11.5), which disrupts peripheral membrane protein association19, caused a small proportion of IFI6 to shift to higher densities, although most of the signal was retained at a lower density. Similar results were obtained with a different gradient composition (Supplementary Fig. 4e). These data indicate that IFI6 is primarily an integral membrane protein, although we cannot rule out that some of the protein may associate to membranes through peripheral interactions. Supporting this conclusion, we did not detect secretion of IFI6 from cells, whereas the secretion of CC-motif ligand 2 (CCL2), a control, was robust and readily blocked by Brefeldin A treatment (Fig. 3g).",

This correlated with near-complete suppression of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication intermediates (Fig. 4c). We attempted to overcome IFI6-mediated inhibition by rescuing a serially passaged YFV mutant. However, after passaging YFV 20 times in IFI6-expressing cells, we were unable to rescue an escape variant (Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that the IFI6-mediated replication block is not easily overcome by mutation.

            "text": "Two models may explain how IFI6 inhibits flavivirus replication: in model 1, IFI6 inhibits the viral polymerase or viral RNA amplification, thereby preventing the production of viral proteins that induce replication organelle formation; in model 2, IFI6 has no effect on replication per se, but rather interferes with the ability of the viral proteins to invaginate the ER membrane, which is required for robust replication. To distinguish these two possibilities, we performed a time-of-addition experiment in which IFI6 was expressed either before or after infection. We found that expressing IFI6 at the same time as or after viral infection rendered IFI6 incapable of inhibiting replication, as shown by infectivity assays and viral NS1 protein expression (Fig. 4d,e). Thus, despite being expressed in virally infected cells, IFI6 cannot inhibit viral replication once it is already established. This \u2018point-of-no-return\u2019 phenotype indicates that IFI6 is primarily a prophylactic antiviral effector and suggests that it may target virus-induced membrane alterations at the ER (model 2) rather than viral genome amplification (model 1). In support of this conclusion, when we infected IFI6-expressing cells at a high enough multiplicity of infection (MOI) of DENV to partially overcome the antiviral effect, we observed that IFI6 colocalized with ER-resident DENV NS4B (Fig. 4f,g, and Supplementary Fig. 8). We also found that, in some cells, IFI6 relocalized to NS4B-rich large cytoplasmic punctae, which are characteristic of DENV infection17 (Fig. 4f). As NS4B helps to form the membrane scaffold that is required for replication organelle biogenesis23\u201325, we propose that IFI6, if expressed before infection, suppresses flavivirus replication by thwarting virus-induced ER perturbations.",

            "text": "Our model also predicts that IFI6 would not target RNA viruses that do not replicate on ER membranes. Indeed, ectopic expression of IFI6 did not inhibit other diverse RNA viruses, including Sindbis virus (SINV; Togaviridae family), coxsackie B virus (CVB; Picornaviridae family) or measles virus (Paramyxoviridae family) (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The loss of IFI6 did not affect IFN-mediated inhibition of SINV or CVB infection (Supplementary Fig. 5c). We next tested the inhibitory potential of IFI6 against hepatitis C virus (HCV), which, like DENV or YFV, is a Flaviviridae family member (genus Hepacivirus). Using multiple HCV constructs in both gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays, we found that IFI6 lacked inhibitory activity against HCV (Fig. 4h\u2013j and Supplementary Fig. 5d). This was unexpected as HCV also replicates at the ER. However, rather than induce single-membrane invaginations like the flaviviruses, HCV infection results in the formation of double-membrane vesicles that protrude out from the ER1. To determine whether HCV subverts the antiviral effects of IFI6, which was proposed recently26, we co-infected cells with both YFV and HCV reporter viruses, predicting that IFI6 may have reduced activity against YFV if HCV counteracts its function. However, IFI6 still inhibited YFV, but not HCV (Fig. 4k), suggesting that HCV does not antagonize IFI6 in a manner that interferes with its anti-flavivirus activity (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Other groups have reported that ectopically expressed IFI6 inhibits HCV27,28, but the magnitude of inhibition in those studies was typically on the order of twofold, rather than the multiple log-fold inhibition that we observed with flaviviruses. Moreover, supporting our data, three independent loss-of-function screens to identify genes that mediate the IFN response to HCV failed to identify IFI6 as a hit29\u201331. Beyond HCV, we also found that IFI6 does not inhibit a coronavirus (Fig. 4l), which, like HCV, forms double-membrane vesicles at the ER32. Together, these data support a model in which IFI6 inhibits ER membrane perturbations specific to flaviviruses, but not to other viruses that generate different ER structures (Fig. 4m).",

The unique viral specificity of IFI6 suggests a mechanism that may be tailored for flavivirus-induced single-membrane invaginations at the ER, but not the ER-derived double-membrane vesicles formed during the replication of HCV and coronavirus. If the host has evolved multiple mechanisms to inhibit membrane-derived viral replication compartments, then future studies may reveal IFI6-like molecules that target other viruses replicating at the ER or distinct membranous organelles. Our findings further raise the intriguing possibility that this antiviral strategy may be leveraged for therapeutic intervention of flavivirus infection.",

The protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by Bradford Assay (Pierce). Alternatively, cell pellets were directly boiled in 2\u00d7 SDS\u2013PAGE sample buffer (100 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 2% BME and 0.1% Bromophenol blue) or 2\u00d7 Tricine sample buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 2% SDS and 0.04% Coomassie blue). Lysates were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli method. For endogenous IFI6 detection, 10% Tris-Tricine gels were used. Proteins were blotted to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes (Bio-Rad) and processed for western blotting. Blots were blocked overnight in 3% or 5% milk in 1\u2013 TBST (50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20), followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Proteins were visualized by incubating blots with enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Pierce) and exposing blots to autoradiography film (Denville Scientific). The antibodies used in the study include: anti-FLAG M2 (F3165, Sigma), anti-FLAG polyclonal (F7425, Sigma), anti-\u03b2-actin (ab6276, Abcam), anti-BiP (PA5-34941, Thermo Fisher), anti-calnexin (ADI-SPA-860-D, Enzo Life Sciences), anti-KDEL (ADI-SPA-827D, Enzo Life Science), anti-RFP (AB233, Evrogen), anti-DENV NS4A (GTX132069, GeneTex), anti-NS1 (gift from M. Diamond), rabbit IgG control (ab27478, Abcam), mouse IgG control (ab81032, Abcam), goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). For the detection of endogenous IFI6, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was custom generated by ProSci, Inc. The antigen consisted of a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of IFI6 (LMGYATHKYLDSEED) and containing an N-terminal cysteine to assist in conjugation to the carrier protein. Antibody was further isolated by immunoaffinity purification of the serum.",
