Examples of such companies include 50 myHealthTrack (http://myhealthtrack.com; San Diego, California, USA) and PostopQRS 51 (https://www.postopqrs.com; London, UK). 52 D) Innovations in education: virtual and augmented reality training, digitalization 53 of meetings and lectures. Given the cost of travel and the pressure to catch-up with all the 54 elective care that has been unmet after the pandemic, virtual educational alternatives will become 55 more widespread. Remote conferencing services companies such as Zoom (www.zoom.us; San 56 Jose, California, USA) have seen a sharp increase in their utilization and stock price during the 57 first few months of 2020. Many organizations such as the American Academy of Orthopaedic 58 Surgeons and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons may start offering more Continuing 59 Medical Education (CME) online virtual alternatives to meetings and travel. And educational 60 organizations such as Vumedi (www.vumedi.com; Oakland, California, USA) will also step up 61 by offering more educational opportunities with strategic collaborations with industry and 62 healthcare organizations. What is perhaps more exciting is the growing role that virtual and 63 augmented reality training will have on resident and fellow education. 6 These technologies may 64 not only reduce the cost of education for the salesforce of device companies, but also improve 65 surgeon engagement and customer acquisition. Examples include virtual surgical planning 66 offered by many companies (e.g. Blueprint TM , Wright Medical, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; 67 VIP TM , Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA) and virtual reality training programs (e.g. Precision OS, California, USA). 70 E) Simplification and enhanced access to appointments. Patients may not want to wait 71 for several weeks or months to see their provider after the outbreak. Services such as UberDoc 72 (https://uber-docs.com; Boston, Massachusetts, USA) and Zocdoc (https://www.zocdoc.com; 73 New York City, New York, USA) that facilitate direct access to available providers at 74 transparent prices may gain momentum.
