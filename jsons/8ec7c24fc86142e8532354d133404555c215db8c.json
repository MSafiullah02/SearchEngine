Herein, data pertaining to factors that influence the environmental mediation of influenza transmission are critically reviewed, including: frequency, magnitude and size distribution and virus expiration, inactivation rates, environmental and self-contact rates, and viral transfer efficiencies during contacts. Where appropriate, two-stage Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is used to characterize variability and uncertainty in the reported data. Significant uncertainties are present in most factors, due to: limitations in instrumentation or study realism; lack of documentation of data variability; or lack of study. These analyses, and future experimental work, will improve parameterization of influenza transmission and risk models, facilitating more robust characterization of the magnitude and uncertainty in infection risk.",

(1\u22123) Though vaccines offer the surest protection against influenza infection, it is expected, and has been the experience with 2009 H1N1, that the development and distribution of vaccines against novel strains may be delayed. (4\u22126) Additionally, the stock of antiviral medications may be inadequate or ineffective. (7, 8) As a result, nonpharmaceutical interventions-for example, frequent hand washing, surface disinfection, the use of respiratory protection, and increased social distancing-are important tools for influenza mitigation. (1, 2) The selection of effective nonpharmaceutical interventions, however, requires understanding the routes by which influenza is transmitted, and the relative risk from each route. Hand washing, for example, will only interrupt transmission mediated by hand contact and only be an effective intervention if hand contact poses a high infection risk, relative to the other routes.",

The contact route involves the deposition of virus on the eyes, nostrils, and/or lips by touching virus-contaminated objects, that is, the fingertip, to those tissues, followed by transport of virus to the appropriate receptors. (11, 12) The inhalation route involves the inhalation of virus-containing respirable particles (aerodynamic diameters, d a \u2264 10 \u03bcm), which deposit throughout the respiratory tract, including the lung. The inspiration route involves the inhalation of inspirable particles (10 < d a \u2264 100 \u03bcm), which deposit in the mouth and naso-pharynx region. The inhalation and inspiration routes are distinguished because respirable and inspirable particles deposit in different regions of the respiratory tract; (13) and influenza receptor localization and temperature gradients in respiratory tract differentially influence the likelihood of infection in each region. (14\u221217) In vivo studies demonstrate that the location of virus deposition differentially impacts infection risk. (18\u221221) The direct spray route involves the direct projection of virus carried in cough and sneeze particles (generally d a > 100 \u03bcm) onto the eyes, nostrils, and lips.",

While Nicas and Jones, (20) using point estimates for all model parameters, found that all four routes may contribute significantly to influenza infection risk, Atkinson and Wein (22) concluded that inhalation was the predominate route of transmission. One reason for the different results is the parameterization of the contact route. Atkinson and Wein (22) used a composite parameter to represent the transfer of virus from the surface to the facial membranes via hand contact (5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m 2 /h in the infectors bedroom), that is, two orders of magnitude lower than the equivalent rate estimated by Nicas and Jones (20) (8.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 m 2 /h).

The simplest assumption is that the virus concentration is uniform throughout the particle size distribution, such that larger particles contain more virus. While Gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli have been found most frequently in cough particles with d a < 3.3 \u03bcm, (48, 49) confidence in these findings is limited due to the high possibility of particle impaction and deposition in the 47.8 cm tube between the coughing participant and the sampling chamber. Morawska (47) provides a more compelling reasons for nonuniform concentrations in the context of cough and sneeze particles: for wind shear particle formation, the magnitude and location of high air speeds that generate the particle size distribution vary with expiratory activity, and may or may not correspond to the location of peak pathogen concentrations in the respiratory tract. Thus, the number of pathogens in the particle will depend upon where the particle was formed and the site of infection.",

In Empirical distributions equilibrium particle size (\u03bcm) emitted during talking (counting 1-100) and coughing measured from diameter of particle residues by Xie et al. (42) and a light-scattering system by Chao et al. (56) compared to that measured by Loudon and Roberts (51) and Duguid (53) using particle residues. studies of talking, Chao et al. (56) measured particles with diameters <50 \u03bcm more frequently than other investigators ( Fig. 2a ): the distributions measured by Xie et al. (42) and Loudon and Roberts (51) are similar to each other, and shifted toward larger particles diameters relative to Duguid. (53) In studies of coughing, again the distribution measured by Chao et al. (56) has more particles with diameters <50 \u03bcm than the other investigators ( Fig. 2b ), but the frequency of particles with diameters <5 \u03bcm is similar to that measured by Loudon and Roberts.

Due to the 20-minute delay between inoculation and contact, the observation of 0.71% (s = 0.02%) efficiency of rhinovirus 14 transfered between fingerpads is less useful. (70) Very high transfer efficiency-mean 33.9%-has been observed for bacteriophage PRD-1 from an inoculated fingertip to the lip during a 10-second contact. (75) The efficiency is much greater than the 0.02% observed between fingertips immediately after inoculation with bacteriophage X174, (76) and is more similar to efficiencies observed for hepatitis A.

Observing 10 adults working alone in an office for 3 hours, Nicas and Best (78) found the mean handto-face contact rate to be 15.7 (s = 11.7) touches per hour: the lip was the most frequently touched location on the face, with mean rate 8 (s = 8) touches per hour, followed by the nostril and eye with 5.3 (s = 3.7) touches per hour and 2.5 (s = 1.9) touches per hour, respectively. I fit Weibull distributions to the contact rate per hour by maximum likelihood estimation, due to successful representation of contact rates in similar contexts by this distribution. (80, 81) With parameter standard errors, the fitted distributions are: Weibull (1.28 \u00b1 0.343, 16.8 \u00b1 4.33) for all contacts, Weibull (0.760 \u00b1 0.206, 7.07 \u00b1 3.07) for lip contacts, Weibull (1.08 \u00b1 0.295, 2.46 \u00b1 0.780) for eye contacts, and Weibull (1.31 \u00b1 0.357, 5.59 \u00b1 1.41) for nose contacts. In contrast, the combined rate of nose-picking and eye-rubbing was observed to be only 0.70 touches per hour in a public auditorium. (79) More frequently, self-contact rates have been investigated among children. (73, 80, 81) Meta-analysis of hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth activity studies found the frequency of contacts to decrease with age. (80, 81) Among the oldest age group studied, children 6 to <11 years, hand-to-mouth and object-tomouth contact rates were observed to have mean 6.7 (s = 5.5) contacts per hour and 1.12 (s = 1.05) contacts per hour, respectively, in indoor environments. The mean rate of hand-to-mouth contacts is quite similar to the mean rate of hand-to-lip contact observed by Nicas and Best (78) (6.7 per hout vs. 8 per hour). Probability distributions fit to these data were Weibull (1.36, 7.34) for hand-to-mouth contacts, and Weibull (0.85, 1.04) for object-to-mouth contacts.",

Mathematical modeling, however, can begin to explore these questions by quantitatively describing the mechanisms by which influenza virus moves from an infectious source through the environment to a susceptible person. Modeling of influenza transmission mechanisms and infection risk has been undertaken by several investigators, (20, 22, 86, 87) but the representativeness of results is limited by the quality and quantity of data for parameterization of influenza transmission models.",

(59, 60) However, the complete size distribution of particles emitted by persons infected with influenza, and the concentration of virus in those particles, has not been determined experimentally. The respirable portion of the distribution has been characterized during breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing using optical particle counting, (41, 43, 52, 57) while the distribution of inspirable and larger particles has been characterized during talking, coughing, and sneezing by measuring the diameter of deposited droplet residues. (42, 51, 53) The light scattering technique used by Chao et al. (56) may characterize a wide range of sizes, but the vast majority of particles measured had diameters <50 \u03bcm, though photographic evidence and our personal experiences assure us larger particles are present.

Previous work has assumed that virus is uniformly distributed by volume, with the volumetric concentration defined by the concentration in nasal wash specimens, such that the number of virus per particle is a function of particle volume. (20) Morawska, (47) however, has suggested that the distribution of virus in particles may depend more upon the location of particle formation (type of expiratory event), and the site of viral shedding. The concentration of influenza virus in the respiratory tract during natural infections has been reasonably well characterized, (59, 60) though the relationship between the viral concentration in swab specimens and respiratory secretions is uncertain.",

Variation in experimental designs has led to inactivation rates that vary by an order of magnitude, such as influenza A PR 8 inactivation in air as studied by Hemmes et al. (62) and Harper (61) (k = 5.5 per hour vs.k = 0.621 per hour at 15-40% RH and room temperature) and influenza A on glass versus steel and formica as studied by Buckland and Tyrell (68) and Bean et al. (63) (k = 2.62 per hour vs.k = 0.178 per hour at room temperature). Even for less striking differences, absent variability data, it is difficult to assess if inactivation rates truly vary by virus type (A or B) or substrate. In uncertainty analyses presented here, variability in influenza virus inactivation on substrates has been based on the CV observed for related viruses. Due to uncertainty in variability, the viruses have been grouped for analysis: in air at room temperature, on porous substrates, on steel and formica, and on glass.",

In studies at room temperature, the inactivation rate of influenza A and B in air ranged 0.06-5.5 per hour, compared to 0.1-3.2 per hour on porous and nonporous substrates. The inactivation rate measured on skin is an order of magnitude larger,k = 71.9 per hour. (63) A significant uncertainty, which limits confidence in both the absolute and relative magnitudes of these inactivation rates, is the suspension of virus in laboratory media, rather than biological matrices such as human mucus or saliva. Thomas et al. (64) measured the presence or absence of influenza A and B over time on bank notes when suspended in laboratory media and human mucus: the presence of mucus increased persistence from a few hours to 1-17 days. Research into the influence of biological matrices on influenza inactivation, as has been conducted with enteric viruses in dilute feces suspensions, (71, 72) would be an important contribution to understanding transmission of influenza. Based on the results of Thomas et al., (64) use of inactivation rates for influenza virus in laboratory media will underestimate persistence, and therefore underestimate exposure and infection risk.",

Issues relating to instrumentation have largely impacted our understanding of the size and count distribution of emitted influenzaladen particles. Understanding of influenza inactivation and transfer has been limited by a lack of realism and documentation of variability: increasing the realism in contact scenarios and virus matrix, and documenting study replicate results would contribute significantly to the knowledge about how the environment, virus strain, and human activity affects the transport of virus through the environment. Factors that have been rarely or never studied include: the transfer of influenza A between skin, including during self-contact, environmental contact rates, and frequency of direct spray events. All of these factors directly affect the likelihood of exposure through contact, inspiration, and direct spray. None of the limitations are insurmountable.",

This analysis will facilitate the selection of model parameter values in quantitative studies of influenza transmission mechanisms and infection risk, and stimulate targeted experimental research to inform our understanding of influenza transmission mechanisms and infection risk. Future work will integrate these results with an influenza transmission model to determine how the magnitude and uncertainty in the factors identified herein influence the magnitude of infection risk and the contributions from each of the four transmission routes.",
