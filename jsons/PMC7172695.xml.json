PRRS manifests itself clinically with severe reproductive failures in sows and respiratory distress in piglets (Chand et al., 2012; Albina, 1997). Specifically, the emergences of highly pathogenic PRRSV strains in China have posed a new threat to the swine industry (Tian et al., 2007a).",

The two polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into mature nonstructural proteins (nsps) by ORF1a-encoded proteases including nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, and nsp4 (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder et al., 1995, 1996). Nsp1 and nsp2 are involved in the cleavage at nsp1/2 and nsp2/3 sites, respectively, while nsp4 is responsible for the cleavage of the remaining nsps (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Snijder et al., 1992). Nsp4, a 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP), plays a significant role in the processing of pp1a and pp1ab to release nsp3 to nsp12 from pp1a/ab (van Aken et al., 2006a; Li et al., 2015).",

In these signaling pathways, NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) and virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA, also called MAVS or IPS-1) play essential roles in regulating the expression of IFN-I and inflammatory cytokines (Kawai et al., 2005; Satoshi and Shizuo, 2006; Akira et al., 2006).",

Previous reports have demonstrated that PRRSV expresses some IFN-I antagonists such as the nsp1, nsp4, and nsp11 to suppress IFN-I production (Luo et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2014, 2016; Shi et al., 2010, 2011; Music and Gagnon, 2010). We have previously shown that HP-PRRSV-nsp4 inhibits IFN-I production induced by poly(I:C) dependent on the 3CLSP activity of nsp4 (Huang et al., 2014). Previous studies have mainly focused on the nsp4 catalytic triad and there are rare studies about the functions of other amino acids in nsp4 (Huang et al., 2014, 2016; Chen et al., 2019). However, when there is a deletion mutation instead of the catalytic triad, nsp4 also loses its ability to inhibit IFN-I production induced by poly(I:C) (Huang et al., 2014). Given the pivotal role of nsp4 in regulating IFN-I and the fact that there are still unknown functions of nsp4, it is necessary for us to study this 3CLSP at the amino acid level.",

As a 3C-like serine protease, nsp4 has three domains (called domain I, II, and III, respectively) and the catalytic triad is located in domain I and domain II (Tian et al., 2009). To investigate if there is any other amino acids in nsp4 in addition to His39-Asp64-Ser118 that are important for nsp4 to inhibit IFN-I production, we generated several nsp4 mutants with point amino acid substitution by Alanine (Ala). Alignments for most of the highly pathogenic PRRSV strains showed that the mutated amino acids were relatively conserved in domain I to III (data not shown). CRL-2843 cells were co-transfected with each of the plasmids encoding these mutants and an IFN-\u03b2-luciferase reporter plasmid. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with poly(I:C) for 8 h and luciferase activities were examined. As shown in Fig. 1\nA, wild-type (wt) nsp4 strongly inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation, while Alanine185 (Ala185) mutation in nsp4 disrupted its ability to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation. To see if the mutations had effects on nsp4 expression, we did Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1A, the nsp4 mutants expressed the same as wt-nsp4. The Isoleucine178 (Ile178) and Aspartic acid185 (Asp185) are located in domain III in nsp4, while the other mutants are located in domain I and domain II, respectively. Interestingly, multiple sequence alignments of the 3CLSPs of the viruses in the family Arteriviridae, including both highly pathogenic PRRSV and classical PRRSV strains and EAV, showed that Asp185 was highly conserved (Fig. 1B). To exclude the possibility that the amount of nsp4-D185A might play a role, we did a dose-dependent experiment. Our results indicated that nsp4-D185A did not inhibit the poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity even at higher doses (Fig. 1C). Then, we confirmed this result by analyzing IFN-\u03b2 expression. As shown in Fig. 1D, wt nsp4 significantly suppressed IFN-\u03b2 expression to 54%, while nsp4 with Ala185 mutation did not inhibit IFN-\u03b2 expression induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data show that Asp185 plays a role in modulating the capacity of HP-PRRSV-nsp4 to antagonize IFN-I expression.",

We then investigated whether the protease activity alteration in nsp4 was associated with Asp185 mutation. To verify the 3CLSP activity of nsp4, we first generated fusion proteins nsp3\u20324(S118Y) and nsp11\u203212, which were used as substrates (Huang et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2010). The nsp3\u20324(S118Y) substrate contains the last 8 amino acids of nsp3 and the whole amino acids of nsp4, which has a mutated Ser118 to disrupt its 3CLSP activity to avoid self-cleaving. The nsp11\u203212 substrate contains the whole amino acids of both nsp11 and nsp12. As expected, nsp4 with Ala185 mutation did not cleave the substrates, implying that replacing Asp185 with Ala impaired its protease activities (Fig. 3\nA and B). To further clarify how residue Asp185 regulates the 3CLSP activity, we first generated a nsp4 mutant (nsp4-D185E) by replacing Asp185 with a negatively charged amino acid Glutamate185 (Glu, E) or a mutant (nsp4-D185K) by replacing Asp185 with a positively charged amino acid Lysine185 (Lys, K). We then transfected each of the vectors into HeLa cells along with nsp11\u203212 expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 3C, both nsp4-D185E and nsp4-D185K did not cleave nsp11\u203212, suggesting that the charge of the residue 185 is not a key factor in affecting the protease activity of nsp4. Next, to explore if the size of residue 185 in nsp4 plays a role in regulating its 3CLSP activity, we made nsp4 mutants with Serine185 (Ser, S) and Cysteine185 (Cys, C), which have similar sizes with aspartic acid. Similarly, nsp4-D185C and nsp4-D185S did not cleave nsp11\u203212 (Fig. 3D), implying that the amino acid size of residue 185 in nsp4 is also not a key factor in keeping its protease activity. Then, to investigate whether the residue structure at position 185 in nsp4 plays a role in keeping its protease activity, we replaced nsp4 Asp185 with Asparagine (Asn, N), which has the most similar structure to aspartic acid among the other 19 amino acids. Surprisingly, nsp4-D185N cleaved nsp11\u203212 (Fig. 3E), even though the cleaving was in a less effective way, suggesting that the residue structure of Asp185 in nsp4 might play an important role in keeping its protease activity.",

Previous study shows that pET32a-nsp3'4(S118Y) is used as one of the most optimal substrates (Xu et al., 2010). Once the substrate is cleaved at the nsp3 and nsp4(S118Y) junction (E/G) by the active 3CLSP, pET32a-Nsp3 moiety of 18 kDa will be expected. To investigate the nsp4 proteolytic activity, purified wt nsp4 and nsp4-D185N with substrates were incubated in Tris-HCl buffer for 12 h. SDS-PAGE results showed that there were more cleaved products by wt nsp4 than nsp4-D185N (Fig. 4\nA). To further confirm this result, a fluorogenic peptide substrate containing the cleavage sites (E/G) derived from nsp11\u203212 was synthesized, and then fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay was performed to explore whether wt nsp4 and nsp4-D185N cleave the peptide substrates with different proteolytic activity. As shown in Fig. 4B, the fluorescence value with wt nsp4 had a sharping increase along with time. However, the fluorescence value with nsp4-D185N increased slowly and lightly. In addition, when a small amount of purified proteins were incubated with sufficient fluorogenic peptide substrates in vitro, the fluorescence value with wt nsp4 was significantly higher than that with nsp4-D185N after 10 min reaction (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that replacing aspartic acid with asparagine at position 185 reduces the proteolytic activity of nsp4.",

We then infected PAMs with wt HP-PRRSV strain HV and the recombinant virus PRRSV-D185N at an MOI of 0.01. As shown in Fig. 5B, there were hardly any living PAMs existed at 48 h post-infection (hpi) with wt HV, while there were no obvious cytopathic effects observed in PAMs infected with PRRSV-D185N. In addition, PRRSV-D185N grew much slower than wt HV, with a titer about 100 times lower than that of wt HV at 48 hpi (Fig. 5C). Next, we investigated whether wt HV and PRRSV-D185N had different abilities to induce IFN-I expression. PAMs were infected with either wt HV or PRRSV-D185N, and then harvested for IFN-I expression analysis. At 8 hpi, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 expression induced by PRRSV-D185N increased about 4 folds and 3 folds higher than that induced by wt HV, respectively (Fig. 5D). To study whether PRRSV-D185N has less ability to inhibit poly(I:C)-induced type I IFNs, we infected PAMs at an MOI of 0.01 and then stimulated the cells with poly(I:C) at 24 hpi. At 6 h post-stimulation, the mRNA levels of type I IFNs were analyzed using qPCR. As shown in Fig. 5E, wt HV down-regulated IFN-\u03b1 expression to 10%, while PRRSV-D185N reduced IFN-\u03b1 expression to 33%. Wt HV down-regulated IFN-\u03b2 expression to 31% and PRRSV-D185N reduced IFN-\u03b2 expression to 76%. Similar results were obtained with the analysis of ISGs (Fig. 5F). Taken together, these data indicate that the recombinant virus PRRSV-D185N has a less effective replication rate and much more potential to induce type I IFNs expression in vitro.",

Tao et al. has found that PRRSV nsp4 can cleave pDCP1a to down-regulate pDCP1a expression, which is an ISG and inhibits PRRSV replication (Tao et al., 2018). Chen et al. has determined that the amino acid at residue 155 in PRRSV nsp4 contributes to its inhibitory effect on IFN-\u03b2 transcription in vitro by altering its subcellular distribution (Chen et al., 2014). In our study, we characterized 6 nsp4 mutants with amino acid point mutations conserved in the domain I to III in most of the highly pathogenic PRRSV strains. We found that Asp185 mutation in nsp4 disrupted its ability to suppress IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 1A and C). Considering that Asp185 in nsp4 is strongly conserved not only in HP-PRRSV strains but also in other viruses of the family Arteriviridae, we speculate that Asp185 in nsp4 might contribute to its 3CLSP activity (Fig. 1B).",

            "text": "Like other RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales, such as EAV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), PRRSV-encoded proteases play a prominent role in virus replication. PRRSV nsp4 is responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing to join into the virus replication (Aeksiri and Jantafong, 2017). PRRSV nsp4 has three domains, including two antiparallel \u03b2-barrels (called domain I and domain II, respectively) and an extra C-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2 domain (domain III) (Tian et al., 2009). A canonical catalytic triad composed of Ser118, His39, and Asp64 has been documented in the open cleft between domain I and domain II. However, our previous study shows that nsp4 without domain III has an impaired ability to inhibit IFN-\u03b2, suggesting that domain III is also important in keeping nsp4 activity (Huang et al., 2014). Even though limited studies suggest that domain III plays a role in nsp4 protease processing (van Aken et al., 2006b), there are still a lot of mysteries about it. Here, we demonstrated that Asp185 mutation in nsp4 impaired its ability to cleave nsp3\u20324(S118Y) and nsp11\u203212 (Fig. 3A and B). Interestingly, we observed that both of HV nsp4-D185A and VR2332 nsp4-D185A still cleaved some nsp3\u20324, but not nsp11\u203212. We speculate that it might be due to the specific structure of this nsp3\u20324(S118Y) substrate. Although both nsp3\u20324(S118Y) and nsp11\u203212 are substrates for nsp4, the amino acids in nsp3\u20324(S118Y) are totally different from nsp11\u203212. Nsp4-D185A might have some protease activity for nsp3\u20324 but not for nsp11\u203212. However, the underlying rationale needs to be investigated in the future.",

            "text": "Previous studies have found that several residue mutations in 3C-like protease can change its enzymatic activity to influence the protease function. As for SARS-CoV 3C-like protease, mutating residues Ser284, Thr285 and Ile286 located in domain III of the 3C-like protease to Ala causes a super-active triple-mutant STI/A with activity enhancement (Shi and Song, 2006; Yang et al., 2003). In our study, Asp185 also locates in the domain III of nsp4, which is spatially far from the catalytic triad. After a series of attempts to illustrate the impact of Asp185 on nsp4, we found that only the Asn185 mutation still kept the proteolytic activity of nsp4. Although Asp has negatively charged side chains while Asn does not, both of them are hydrophilic. Structure of Asn is the most similar one to that of Asp, because the structure of amide group (-CONH2) is similar to carboxyl group (-COOH) and both of them have carbon chains with the same length. These suggest that it is the residue structure itself but not the charge and residue size at position 185 that might regulate its proteolytic activity (Fig. 3C\u2013E). To investigate how the residue structure plays the role, we compared the side chain structures of the residues (Fig. 6\nA). Analysis showed that there were hydrogen bonds between Asp185 and Leucine159 (Leu159) and between Asp185 and Ser160 (Fig. 6B). However, when Asp185 was replaced by Ala, there were no hydrogen bonds formed between Ala185 and Leu159 or Ser160 (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, when Asp185 was replaced with Asn, similar hydrogen bonds were formed between Asn185 and Leu159 and between Asn185 and Ser160 (Fig. 6D). Energy analysis showed that nsp4 with Ala185 mutation had higher energy value than nsp4 with Asp185 or Asn185 mutation, indicating that both Asp185 and Asn185 can keep nsp4 at a stable condition (data not show). These findings suggest that the hydrogen bonds between these residues might be an important factor in keeping nsp4 structure stable and its proteolytic activity. However, we are not sure if there are any changes caused by the mutation of Asp185 in nsp4 when it is combined with the substrates, since there is no published structure of arterivirus nsp4 in complex with its substrates.",

A previous report shows that the compounds targeting 3CLSP are used to identify inhibitors that suppress PRRSV replication (Chen et al., 2010). Danny van Aken et al. replace Ala155 and Asp156 in EAV nsp4 with Glycine (Gly) individually or both and get two impaired but not dead virus phenotypes (van Aken et al., 2006b). Since nsp4-D185N has impotent but not null proteolytic activities, it gives us a reason to construct the recombinant virus PRRSV-D185N. The recombinant PRRSV-D185N replicated significantly slower than wt HP-PRRSV HV in PAMs with a much lower titer in vitro (Fig. 5B and C). This is in consistent with the proteolytic activity study, which shows that the proteolytic activity of nsp4 with Asn185 mutation is decreased (Fig. 4A\u2013C). Undoubtedly, PRRSV-D185N has a stronger ability to induce IFN-I, but relatively poor capacity to inhibit IFN-I production induced by poly(I:C) when compared with wt HP-PRRSV (Fig. 5D\u2013F). The decreased replication rate and increased expression of IFN-I during PRRSV-D185N infection might contribute to the fact that the recombinant virus causes fewer obvious cytopathic effects in vitro. However, further studies need to be done to assess whether PRRSV-D185N is attenuated in vivo.",
