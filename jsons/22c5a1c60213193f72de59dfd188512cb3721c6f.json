However, the determinants of susceptibility to acute respiratory tract infections still need to be defined. Objective: We investigated whether the individual variation in antiviral response at birth determines the risk for acute respiratory tract illness in the first year of life. Methods: We studied 82 children who were enrolled in a birth cohort study of inner-city children with at least 1 parent with allergy or asthma. We cultured cord blood monocytes and assessed IFNG and CCL5 mRNA production at 24 hours after inoculation with respiratory syncytial virus. We also monitored the frequency of acute respiratory tract illness at 3-month intervals and analyzed nasal lavage samples for respiratory tract viruses at the time of illness during the first year. Results: Respiratory tract infection was reported for 88% of subjects, and respiratory tract viruses were recovered in 74% of symptomatic children. We observed a wide range of antiviral responses in cord blood monocytes across the population. Furthermore, a decrease in production of IFNG (but not CCL5) mRNA in response to respiratory syncytial virus infection of monocytes was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (r 5 20.42, P < .001) and the prevalence of ear and sinus infections, pneumonias, and respiratory-related hospitalizations. Conclusion: Individual variations in the innate immune response to respiratory tract viruses are detectable even at birth, and these differences predict the susceptibility to acute respiratory tract illness during the first year of life.

Most of these infections are short-lived and selflimited, but some can be severe enough to require hospitalization. Indeed, viral respiratory tract infections are associated with 20% of all mortality in children less than 5 years of age. 1 In addition to the morbidity of the acute infection, viral respiratory tract infections with wheezing are strong indicators of subsequent asthma. 2, 3 Therefore predicting those infants at risk for respiratory tract infections is an important first step in preventing acute and chronic respiratory disease. Previous studies have identified a variety of potential risk factors for viral lower respiratory tract infections during the first year of life. These factors include day care attendance, number of siblings, small lung size, exposure to tobacco smoke, low birth weight, and premature birth. [3] [4] [5] [6] Infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are particularly implicated in acute illness and chronic lung disease in the first 2 years of life. 7 However, the majority of RSV infections in infants occur without any known risk factors. 8 Thus we still do not understand the precise mechanism for the wide variation in susceptibility to severe respiratory tract infections among children in these settings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 321, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 468, "end": 470, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 471, "end": 472, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 920, "end": 923, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 924, "end": 927, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 928, "end": 931, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 932, "end": 935, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1092, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1182, "end": 1183, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "One possible explanation for the range of susceptibility to viral respiratory tract infection in early childhood is that there are definable variations in the antiviral response, such as a congenital deficiency in the innate immune response that can be detected even at the time of birth. A central ingredient of the innate immune response to respiratory viruses is the system for interferon production and signaling. 9 In that regard a decrease in IFN-g production from cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) stimulated by PHA or allergens has been associated with increased risk for acute respiratory tract illness during infancy. 10, 11 Perhaps more relevant to viral infection, the lack of a detectable IFN-g response to RSV in CBMCs was associated with decreased wheezing in the first year of life, but a detectable response was only found in a third of subjects, and therefore predictive power was limited. 12 Therefore in the present study we developed alternative methods to determine whether the innate immune response of virus-infected CBMCs could predict the later development of respiratory tract illness. We used RSV to activate CBMCs based on the well-established association of RSV infection with subsequent childhood asthma. 2, 13, 14 However, to monitor the innate immune response to RSV, we determined the induction of the genes encoding IFN-g and the remarkably virus-responsive chemokine CCL5 based on sensitive and quantitative methods for mRNA From 15 We also monitored interferon signal transduction by tracking the level of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 activation in response to IFN-b stimulation. In both cases we used cultured/adherent CBMCs to select for monocytes versus the mixed cell population that included T cells in previous studies. We assessed whether each of these immune end points could predict the development of respiratory tract illness during the first year of life in a prospective birth cohort of children at high risk for asthma and allergic disease.

Moreover, the effect of viral infection itself was not assessed in these studies. Other studies examined the capacity of PBMCs to produce IFN-g during RSV-induced illness in children, but in this case cells were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-ionomycin and cross-linking antibodies to T-cell costimulatory receptors, and the response was localized to CD3 1 T cells. 20 Similarly, others again made no attempt to purify cells and then stimulated cells with T-cell mitogen and did not separately quantify IFNG mRNA levels. 21 The same approach was taken in previous reports of an association between decreased IFN-g production from CBMCs and an increased risk of allergic sensitization and recurrent wheezing. 12, 22, 23 Here again, this might reflect the focus on T-cell production of IFN-g and the proposed role of T H 1 versus T H 2 cytokines in the development of atopy and asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 269, "end": 272, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 273, "end": 275, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 831, "end": 833, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 986, "end": 988, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1176, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1180, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1183, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "After these studies, we have come to better recognize the critical role of the innate immune system in controlling viral infection and postviral asthma. 9 In particular, the interferon and monocyte-macrophage systems are required for protective immunity against respiratory tract viruses, such as RSV, [24] [25] [26] and these same systems are capable of driving postviral asthma independent of the adaptive immune system, at least in experimental models. [27] [28] [29] Therefore the present approach was designed to directly assess the innate immune response to viral infection and was done so by using the relevant cell type (purified monocytes) and stimulus (RSV infection), as well as more specific and sensitive methods (real-time quantitative PCR) than applied previously. The upshot is the first evidence that the monocyte IFNG gene also serves as a marker and might even participate in the susceptibility to infection during infancy. This unexpected finding provides a new lead for control of the antiviral response because the previous view was that IFNG gene expression was silenced in the monocyte lineage and was only active in lymphoid cells. 30 In that regard we note that IFN-g production is generally attributed to natural killer (NK) cells, NKT cells, and T cells, whereas monocytes and macrophages are solely a target of IFN-g action. Indeed, studies of atopic disease in infancy often focus exclusively on T-cell production of IFN-g. 31 This circumstance is also likely due to the lower levels of IFN-g produced by monocytes and macrophages under conditions used in previous studies. Here we are able to measure IFN-g production by using a sensitive assay for the corresponding mRNA. Whether this level of interferon production has functional consequences is uncertain, but its utility as a biomarker for susceptibility to viral infection proved quite useful. In contrast, it appears that the monocytemacrophage lineage is critical for host defense against respiratory tract viruses (including RSV). In particular, lung macrophages are charged with clearance of infected cells without dying themselves, and this protection derives from an antiapoptotic survival function of the chemokine CCL5. 25 If this function is lost (eg, in mice that are CCL5 deficient), the host is more susceptible to viral respiratory tract infection. Other work suggests that CCL5 is also needed to direct dendritic cell traffic in the face of viral infection. 32 Each of these observations are consistent with those linking CCL5 promoter gene polymorphisms to susceptibility to severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis. 33 Nonetheless, we did not find that RSV induction of CCL5 gene expression was significantly associated with viral respiratory tract infection rates in the first year of life.

Instead, IFNG gene expression is subject to a distinct type of positive and negative regulation at pretranscriptional, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional levels, at least in the case of lymphoid (NK, NKT, and T) cells. 30 However, these regulatory mechanisms have not been studied in monocytes or in response to RSV in any cell type. We could not define this regulatory mechanism with such limited human samples, but our work should open this new field of research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 339, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 340, "end": 342, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 773, "end": 775, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "RSV is the most common cause of serious respiratory tract illness during infancy, and severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis is linked to subsequent wheezing illness/asthma. Furthermore, paramyxoviral infection is established as a high-fidelity experimental model of asthma. Moreover, RSV and related paramyxoviruses are easily detected in monocytes and macrophages in the lung. Hence we chose RSV for our study of newborns and their monocytes, unaware of course that the subsequent results would predict respiratory tract illness associated with rhinovirus. With such a severe limitation in cell sample size, we were unable to test multiple viruses, but an analysis of the response to other types of viruses (including rhinovirus) and viral strains (including other RSV types) would be a valuable goal in the future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, we report that congenital variations in the innate immune response might predict the susceptibility to acute respiratory tract illness during the first year of life. Our effort uncovered evidence that the IFNG mRNA monocyte response to virus rather than T-cell response to mitogen/allergen might be linked to the development of viral infections and eventually postviral asthma. We were able to define this relationship despite a relatively small sample size. Sample availability for complex immunologic analysis served to limit the number of URECA participants that could be studied. However, the demographic characteristics of our cohort were no different from those of the overall group, suggesting that we studied a representative sample of subjects. In addition, our study included mostly African American children, and therefore the result might not be generalized to children with other racial backgrounds. Interestingly, others have recently found that interferon-stimulated genes (eg, PYHIN1) are also linked to the development of asthma, particularly in subjects of African descent. 36 Our findings are also consistent with observations of decreased IFN-g production in response to RSV in PBMCs from older children and adults with allergic asthma. 37, 38 Thus these early events in infancy might carry over to a similar deficit in antiviral defense in later life. Together, the findings suggest that a full analysis of interferon production pathways might provide key insights into the susceptibility to viral respiratory tract infection and subsequent chronic obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma.
