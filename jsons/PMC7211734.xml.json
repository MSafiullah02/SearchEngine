Off-service rotations in medicine and general surgery, while minimally disrupted in volume, have largely shifted their attention to patients with acute medical or surgical needs. All OMS didactics and conferences are being held virtually via teleconference. For residents in medical training, all clinic activities during clerkships and electives have been suspended with emphasis on didactics via teleconference and distance learning. The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step exams have been canceled through May 31, 2020. Likewise, the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery In-service Training Examination (OMSITE), which is typically offered in spring annually, has also been postponed. Dental licensing, initial Basic Life Support (BLS) certification, and Advance Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certification are also all delayed, affecting the ability for incoming residents, who start at the end of June 2020, to provide patient care.",

Special focused site visits have been postponed until the earliest opportunity to conduct the visit. According to the CODA Commissioner, all currently accredited programs will retain their accreditation. The commission is focused on residents and fellows finishing this academic year (2020). Currently, CODA requires 175 major OMS procedures and a cumulative anesthetic experience of 300 general anesthesia/deep sedation cases from each graduating resident. A minimum of 150 of the 300 cases must be ambulatory anesthetics for OMS and must involve care for 50 patients younger than age 13. Due to both surgical and anesthetic volumes being affected by the pandemic, CODA will allow temporary flexibility by evaluating each program\u2019s situation and response. The competency of each graduating resident will be determined by its own program.",

The AAOMS leadership has reached out to the White House and Congress in Washington D.C. to advocate the role of OMSs as essential personnel and first responders in healthcare during the pandemic. In turn, it is crucial for public institutions, as well as state and local governments to support OMSs with allocation of resources, such as PPE, rapid COVID-19 tests, and telehealth. With these vital resources, hospital-based OMSs are able to provide service in a safer environment and community-based OMSs can continue to treat emergent patients while minimizing viral spread and keeping patients out of emergency rooms. In addition, AAOMS is constantly working to provide additional resources, ranging from information on small business loans to complimentary continuing education courses, to help OMSs get through the pandemic and facilitate re-opening of practices for OMSs following the pandemic.",

We must pay attention to the numbers and evaluate the appropriate projection to prepare the health system for upcoming challenges. One of the most valuable roles of OMSs during this pandemic is to manage patients in an outpatient setting or via telemedicine. This keeps many patients out of the hospital emergency departments, which can lighten the load on already strained medical resources. It is important to note, however, that the deferral of many dental treatments (i.e. using prescriptions to manage dental abscesses) is not sustainable in the long term. Many of these patients will eventually need emergency surgical care, such as dental extractions. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause lingering disruptions for many health systems. It could be difficult to immediately ramp up operations post-COVID-19 because the workforce will likely be exhausted and burnt out. This can further increase unmet needs in the health system.",
