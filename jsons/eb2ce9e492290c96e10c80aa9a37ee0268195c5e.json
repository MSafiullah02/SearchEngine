            "text": "Background: West Nile virus (WNV) molecular detection is being conducted by a growing number of laboratories, but the degree of proficiency may vary between them. External quality control is needed. Methods: We have conducted an international quality assurance study on WNV molecular detection. Participating laboratories tested noninfectious samples inactivated by heat and gamma irradiation. Participants received 7 coded lyophilized samples containing WNV of genetic lineages 1a, 1b, and 2 at 2600 to 18 000 000 RNA copies/mL, 3 samples containing heterologous flaviviruses, and 2 negative samples. Results: Thirty laboratories participated. The average laboratory achieved 50% detection probability from 7762 copies/mL onward (probit analysis; 95% CI \u202b\u060d\u202c 1174 -24547 copies/mL). Lineages 1a and 1b were detected with equal efficiencies, but the lineage 2 strain (Ug37) was detected at significantly lower rates. Only 27% of participants were able to detect the 6 samples containing >1.8 \u060b 10 4 copies/mL. Three laboratories generated false-positive results in negative samples. Six of 30 laboratories reported correct strain identification in 3 samples containing non-WNV flaviviruses. We observed a significant positive correlation between the capability of detecting non-WNV flaviviruses and detecting WNV lineage 2. Conclusions: Most participants showed good performance in detecting lineage 1 WNV, the predominant virus in the Northern Hemisphere. The inability of some laboratories to detect even highly concentrated lineage 2 WNV downgraded the overall outcome. The lineage 2 material received through this study will provide laboratories with the necessary template for improving their assays. Such material is otherwise hard to obtain.",

These fractions were plotted against the respective virus concentrations in each sample and analyzed by probit analysis (n \u03ed 30 replicate datum points per concentration). With the exception of 1 outlier sample, the positivity rate of each sample corresponded exactly with the concentration-dependent response rates calculated by a dose-response model (probit analysis, P \u0545 0.0001). When the outlier was eliminated, the hypothetical average laboratory achieved 50% detection probability from 7762 copies of RNA/mL of sample onward (95% CI, 1174 -24547 copies/mL). The outlier sample was the only member of the panel belonging to WNV genetic lineage 2 (strain WNV-Ug37). For this sample, the hit rate was 43.3%, less than half the rate predicted by the regression model. In 10 laboratories, the lineage 2 sample could not be detected, although a lineage 1 sample of 10 times less virus (1.8 \u03eb 10 5 copies/mL) tested positive. For WNV-Kunjin, which is an outlier within lineage 1 (designated lineage 1b), a genotype bias was not observed. The WNV-Kunjin detection rate of 36.7% corresponded well with the dose-response model, because it had a low virus concentration of 2600 copies/mL (Fig. 1 ).

This concentration was chosen because it was well within the detection interval of published and commercial RT-PCR assays for WNV (e.g., (4, 14, 15 ) . Second, no false-positive results were allowed for the 2 negative samples. When we applied these criteria, only 8 of 30 laboratories (27%) passed the minimum requirements for successful participation. All other laboratories failed because of lack of sensitivity, not because of false-positive results ( Table 1) . Six of the 8 successful laboratories also detected the low copy number sample, containing WNV-Kunjin at 2600 copies/mL. Two laboratories missed the proficiency criteria only because the 1.8 \u03eb 10 4 copies/mL lineage 1 sample was not detected. Nine laboratories failed to detect the lineage 2 sample but detected all other samples correctly.

One laboratory provided no correct result at all.",

From a technical point of view, much lower detection limits, in the range of 100-1000 copies/mL, can be achieved in RT-PCR, and some of our participants will indeed reach this concentration. The average laboratory, however, was not as efficient, and only a small number of participants passed a rather easy set of proficiency criteria, a critical problem because maximum sensitivity is required in clinical cases of encephalitis, in blood screening, and in testing reservoir components such as mosquitoes.",

Without the lineage 2 sample, 60% of participants would have passed the proficiency criteria. Because lineage 1 is far more prevalent in general and in the Northern Hemisphere in particular, it is conceivable that many participants may have designed their assays according to their own geographic location, a situation that would be acceptable in most settings. Several other laboratories may have detected lineage 2 only by broad-range flavivirus assays, as suggested by the observed correlation between non-WNV flavivirus detection and lineage 2 results. In view of recent findings on the presence of lineage 2 WNV and potentially new lineages 3 and 4 in Europe (1, 18, 19 ) , the importance of using broad-range assays is obvious. At least on the reference laboratory level, broad-range flavivirus assays should routinely be applied in parallel with specific WNV detection. The present study shows that EQA is adequate and necessary for identifying shortcomings in diagnostic proficiency. For rare pathogens such as WNV, EQA furthermore provides critical virus material that is required to improve and adjust diagnostic assays. The samples used in this study are available from the European Network for Diagnostics of \"Imported\" Viral Diseases for future reference.",
