Unlike its expectations, the latter did not see the arrival of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus responsible for the 2009 Mexican pandemic, where the responsible virus was emerging following the triple reassortment of three influenza A viruses from three different lineages (human, swine, and avian). This highlights the fact that the forecasting progress made to date remains insufficient and that humanity would have a long way to unveil the mechanisms of emergence of new highly pathogenic viral agents. The determinism of emergence and reemergence is an evolutionary process, the success of emergence and reemergence is acquired only after having exceeded the threshold of fitness compensation. Only a holistic and concerted approach will make it possible to better understand these mechanisms by establishing monitoring of specific parameters of emergence factors. It is noteworthy to point out the divergence between policies with economic aims and the need to preserve environmental capital imposes a burden and additional overload hindering development. The dichotomous zone between economic growth strategies and the protection of the environment is currently the basis of all sustainable development. The development of scientific and technical capacities for problems related to the modernization and efficient integration of environmental education into the academia can sustain the balance of global health.\n",
