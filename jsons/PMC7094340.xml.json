The relationship of any airway inflammatory changes to symptoms and physiologic changes during exacerbations of COPD is also an important factor to consider.",

With exacerbations, there were more modest increases observed in neutrophils, T lymphocytes (CD3+), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-positive cells, while there were no changes in the numbers of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, macrophages, or mast cells. However, the technique of sputum induction allows the study of these patients during exacerbations, and it has been shown that it is safe and well-tolerated in COPD patients.13 The levels of inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be elevated in induced sputum from COPD patients when their condition is stable, although changes during exacerbations had not been studied previously.14\n",

There was a relationship between exacerbation frequency and the level of sputum cytokines, in that there were increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 found in the sputum of patients who had been stable at baseline who experienced frequent exacerbations compared to those who experienced infrequent exacerbations (Fig 1), although there was no relationship between the level of cytokines and baseline lung function. Sputum cell counts were not higher at baseline in patients with more frequent exacerbations, suggesting that the increased cytokine production came from the bronchial epithelium in patients with COPD. As discussed below, exacerbations are triggered by viral infections, especially by rhinovirus, which is the cause of the common cold. Rhinovirus has been shown to increase cytokine production in an epithelial cell line,15 and thus, repeated viral infection may lead to the up-regulation of cytokine airway expression.",

Experimental rhinovirus infection has been shown to increase sputum IL-6 levels in healthy subjects and asthmatic patients.16,\n17,\n18 Rising cell counts and increasing levels of IL-8, however, were more variable with exacerbation and did not reach statistical significance, suggesting marked heterogeneity in the degree of the inflammatory response during an exacerbation. IL-8 levels during an exacerbation were related to sputum neutrophil and total cell counts, indicating that neutrophil recruitment is the major source of airway IL-8 during an exacerbation. Airway IL-8 level has been shown to increase with the presence of experimental rhinovirus infection in healthy and asthmatic patients in some studies,17 but not in others.18 However, COPD patients already have up-regulated airway IL-8 expression when they are stable due to their high sputum neutrophil load,14 and further increases in IL-8 levels would be unlikely. COPD exacerbations are associated with less pronounced airway inflammatory responses than are asthmatic exacerbations,19 and this may explain the relatively reduced response to corticosteroid therapy seen during exacerbations in COPD patients, compared to responses during exacerbations in asthma patients.20,\n21,\n22,\n23,\n24,\n25,\n26\n",

They also found that patients with exacerbations that were associated with the presence of rhinovirus in induced sputum had larger increases in airway IL-6 levels,32 suggesting that viruses increase the severity of airway inflammation during the exacerbation. This finding is in agreement with the data that respiratory viruses produce longer and more severe exacerbations and have a major impact on health-care utilization.9,\n32 Other viruses may trigger COPD exacerbations, although coronavirus was associated with only a small proportion of asthmatic exacerbations and is unlikely to play a major role in COPD.29,\n33\n",

During the December 1991 pollution episode in the United Kingdom, the COPD mortality rate increased together with an increase in hospital admissions among elderly COPD patients.53 Data from a study of air pollution in six European cities (Air Pollution and Health, a European Approach project) showed that the relative risks for COPD hospital admissions due to increases of 50 \u03bcg/m3 in the daily mean level of pollutants (with lags from 1 to 3 days) were 1.02 for SO2, NO2, and total suspendable particles, and 1.04 for ozone.54 An analysis of data from Birmingham, AL,55 also showed that the inhalation of particles carried a relative risk of 1.27 for hospital admissions for COPD. Generally, the most convincing relationship for hospital admission due to COPD has been with the level of particulate pollution. Studies also have shown relationships with NO2 exposure, and a study from Australia has suggested an increase of 4.6% in COPD hospital admissions with NO2 exposure.56\n",

One study57 investigated the effect of NO2 exposure in a controlled chamber on the susceptibility to infection with influenza and found some small increases in effect with the combination of virus and pollutant. Another study58 investigated the effects of personal exposure to NO2 on the risk of airflow obstruction in asthmatic children with respiratory infections. This study suggested that with higher personal pollutant exposure, there was a greater risk of an asthmatic exacerbation following a respiratory infection.
