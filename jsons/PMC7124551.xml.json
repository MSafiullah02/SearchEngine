A suggestion is that service providers install safety devices and take other safety and security measures (Palmer, 1989). Experts advise travel agents to avoid booking a hotel or sending their clients to a potentially unsafe destination without having proof of issuing a warning (Cavlek, 2002, Wilks & Page, 2003). As a result of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, airport personnel issued face masks and had tourists go through thermal detectors (McKercher & Chon, 2004). Following the 2006 tsunami, officials are implementing safety measures such as tsunami warning systems (Rittichainuwat, 2006, Rittichainuwat, 2008, Rittichainuwat, 2011).",

Research shows that leisure tourists pay attention to security when traveling and choose travel destinations not only on the basis of price but also based on personal safety (Ananth et al., 1992, McCleary et al., 1993, Prideaux, 1996). Nevertheless, mention of safety measures can frighten tourists (Feickert et al., 2006, Groeneboom and Jones, 2003), so service providers need to frame warnings carefully. Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty (2009) find that only 13% of leisure tourists traveling abroad considered price as the most important destination selection criteria, whereas 63% of their respondents specify personal safety as a high priority in considering low travel costs. Feickert et al. (2006) provide evidence that leisure tourists are becoming tolerant to some inconvenience in exchange for a feeling of safety and security while traveling.",

Because of previous travel experience, frequent business tourists are less risk averse than first time leisure tourists (Sirakaya & Woodside, 2005). Compared to business tourists, leisure tourists are more likely to accept obtrusive safety measures such as metal detectors, background checks and armed guards (Feickert et al., 2006). Although business tourists are less seasonal and less sensitive to price and negative publicity than leisure tourists, business tourists do not overlook safety and security (Withiam, 1998). Frequent-travel business tourists consider safety and security in hotel selection (Knutson, 1988). Female business tourists are more concerned about security than their male counterparts (McCleary, Weaver, & Zhao, 1993), especially regarding physical devices such as a spy hole in a door and a deadlock on the entry door (Sammons, Moreo, Benson, & DeMicco, 1999). Luxury and upscale hotels acknowledge what business tourists want and tend to invest in what these tourists want (Taylor & Enz, 2002). Business tourists tend to expect fewer safety features at relaxing beach resorts than they do at airports and urban hotels (Enz & Taylor, 2002).",

Such surveys may not capture unconscious thoughts (Woodside, 2004), and 95% of thought is sub-conscious (Woodside & Wilson, 2003). However, using long interviews to collect data involves high consumption of time and thus usually of research dollars. Also, a drawback of long interviews is drawing inferences such as proportions of a population being in a certain category (Wilson and Woodside, 1999, Woodside et al., 2004). A combination of data collection methods provides a way to gain in depth insights and adequately reliable statistics. Schatz (2009) highlights the benefit of nesting semi-structured interviews in surveys in solving the quantitative concerns on generalization of the finding to population.",

The program forces the 18 safety measures contributing to the six factor solution (Table 3) to load on only one of the six factors, as identified in Table 3. All cross-loadings are constrained to zero. The Chi-square test for the model is significant (\u03c7\n2\n = 199.4 with 120 df, p-value < 0.0001). Being significant is not surprising given the sample size close to 300 (N = 297). However, the fit indices are also good (NFI = 0.90, TLI = 0.95, CFI = 0.96) and the RMSEA is excellent (0.047).

For example, long interview data show hoteliers have invested significantly in the installation of closed circuit TV and that many locations require guests to present their passport upon check-in. However, inbound tourists do not perceive such measures as very important (more than 65% of respondents consider these as neutral or unimportant). Other studies have similar findings (Palmer, 1989, Saied, 1990). However, inbound survey results differ from those of some other research. Feickert et al. (2006) found positive attitudes of USA tourists toward video surveillance, photo identification, and first aid kits in the hotel room. The inbound data show that less than 17% of respondents from the USA consider these important. Studies show that tourists perceive physical devices, such as emergency power sources and photo ID checks as important in the hotels regardless of size (Bach and Pizam, 1996, Kwortnik, 2005, Milman et al., 1999). However, findings of others differ (Donoho, 1993, Kohr, 1994, National Crime Prevention Institute, 1986). They find importance of some of these only at brand hotels. Recognizing a difference exists is raising a research question. Maybe, examination of why the difference occurs would lead to some important insight. Interviewees in 2011 allowed examination of matters that were problematic. Collecting more data using the structured questionnaire would not have clarified matters. Long interviews can be valuable in formulating structured data collection and vice versa.

If structured data collection had allowed for some unstructured or semi-structured questioning of respondents, the researchers could have obtained better insights into motivation and behavior. Of course with paper questionnaires, reacting by asking general questions based on particular responses or response patterns is not easy (e.g., because a respondent's time to answer expires). However, with surveys on computers, nesting qualitative interviews in questionnaire design is a real possibility. The same device used for structured answers can store verbal responses for later processing. Schatz (2009) suggests that when quantitative findings differ from expectations, a follow-up interview can provide an explanation. With embedding, follow up can be part of data collection. Data collection automation offers advantages including dealing with if-then conditions more effectively than can occur with paper (e.g., see Liu et al., 2011-this issue).",

Government programs may be justified based on net returns to a country.

Although crisis management plans in local brand mid-priced hotels and a newly opened, upscale hotel are less intensive, these hotels are now concerned about the potential threats of disease, terrorism and natural disaster. Supply side interviews make clear the need for hotel associations and government providing encouragement to management of budget and mid-priced hotels. Sending staff to complimentary crisis management training organized by hotel associations and local authorities need not be costly if training does not conflict with times of heavy work load.",

The literature was also the source of the hypothesis that importance responses on safety and security measures of business tourists would differ from those of leisure tourists. Only as analysis progressed did insights into limits of the value of the information collected and analysis approaches being pursued become clear. A main value of this research is insights developed while research progressed.
