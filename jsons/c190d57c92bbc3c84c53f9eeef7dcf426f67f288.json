Airborne precautions including an N95, FFP2, or equivalent respirator; eye protection; gown; and gloves should be used during any aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs). 3, 4 Our air medical teams operate in challenging, space-restricted environments in both fixed and rotary wing aircraft. The confined space, limited airflow, and inability to stop and exit the aircraft mean that our crews use PPE differently than our ground-based colleagues. The BCEHS CCT program quickly identified challenges associated with the WHO's recommended PPE use including the changing of soiled N95 masks in close proximity to patients and the snag risks associated to gowns and aprons. As a result, we opted to adapt our PPE to include hospital scrubs, 1-piece Tyvek suits with hoods, and half facepiece reusable silicone respirators with extended life particulate filters for enhanced durability and increased comfort. The use of powered air-purifying respirators and patient isolation pods continue to be investigated.",

Careful escalation of oxygen therapy and a lower threshold to intubate these patients were thought to mitigate the risks associated with managing a deteriorating patient in an uncontrolled scenario. 6 The use of continuous positive airway pressure was limited, and the use of bag valve mask ventilation was adapted to include a filter and a 2-person technique. Additionally, the regular use of COVID-19-specific rapid sequence induction 7 (Appendix 1) and influenzalike illness (ILI) patient transfer checklists is also recommended and was implemented by the BCEHS CCT program on March 12, 2020.",

Having broad international consensus on best practice has helped ease anxiety among the flight paramedic staff because they know that they were practicing in the same manner as other providers in this setting.
