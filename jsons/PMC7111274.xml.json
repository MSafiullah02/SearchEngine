PED was first observed in Europe in 1971 (Oldham, 1972). PEDV was isolated in Belgium in 1976 (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). Since PEDV was first identified, outbreaks have been reported in many swine-producing countries, notably in Europe and Asia. PEDV has recently re-emerged, with outbreaks in Asia and North America resulting in enormous economic losses (Pasick et al., 2014, Vlasova et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014b). Continuous vaccine efforts have been made and some advances have been achieved since the outbreak (Collin et al., 2015, Song et al., 2015).",

ORF1a encodes the polyprotein pp1a, whereas ORF1a and ORF1b together encode pp1ab (Hegyi et al., 2002, Ziebuhr et al., 2000, Ziebuhr, 2005). The coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro; non-structural protein 5, Nsp5) is part of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, and this enzyme is encoded by ORF1a. With few exceptions, coronaviruses encode two papain-like proteases (called PL1pro and PL2pro, respectively), which are responsible for the cleavage of the N-proximal regions of the polyprotein. The central and C-proximal regions of the polyprotein are cleaved by 3CLpro at 11 conserved sites, and the products are essential for viral replication (Thiel et al., 2001, Thiel et al., 2003, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). Thus, 3CLpro is an appealing target for the design of anti-coronavirus therapies.",

An asparagine is the third member of the catalytic triad in proteases of the papain family. Chymotrypsin and other members of this serine protease family possess a catalytic triad (Anand et al., 2002). However, in coronavirus 3CLpro, there is no third residue involved in catalysis (Hegyi et al., 2002, Liu and Brown, 1995, Lu and Denison, 1997). Notably, a buried water molecular hydrogen-bonded to three surrounding residues takes the place that is normally occupied by the side chain of the third member of the catalytic triad (Anand et al., 2002, Anand et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2003). Coronavirus 3CLpro recognizes a conserved site containing a hydrophobic residue (preferably L) at the P2 position, a Q at the P1 position, and a small aliphatic amino acid residue (S, G, A) at the P1\u2032 position (Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002, Hsu et al., 2005, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The previously reported nomenclature system was used to describe the residue sites of the peptide substrates and the substrate binding sites of the protease (Schechter and Berger, 1967).",

In terms of coronavirus 3CLpros, only the dimeric form is functional (Chen et al., 2008, Li et al., 2010, Shi et al., 2008). In the structure of TGEV 3CLpro, the N-terminus of one monomer helps shape the S1 pocket and the oxyanion hole of the opposite monomer; thus, dimerization is essential for its catalytic activity (Anand et al., 2002). The dimerization and trans-cleavage activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro are completely inhibited by the E290R and R298E (located at the C-terminal helix) variants and partly inhibited by the R4E (located at the N-terminal loop) variant (Hilgenfeld, 2014).",

The four variants still primarily exist as dimers, however the relative populations of the variants monomers, except S138A, increased slightly.

Two 3CLpro molecules are observed in the asymmetric unit, and the two monomers have the similar overall structures (RMSD of 0.25 \u00c5 for 186 superimposed C\u03b1 atoms of domain I and domain II, 0.92 \u00c5 for 99 superimposed C\u03b1 atoms of domain III). However, the first two domains show low RMSD values, it seems that they are more stable than the C-terminal helix domain. An eight amino acid peptide (SAVLQ\u2193SGF) is observed in only one monomer according to the density map (\nFig. 5), but the substrate-binding sites of the two monomers are almost identical. The first two domains show almost no differences and domain III shows slight structure deviation. However, the substrate lies in the cleft between the first two domains. Thus, the absence of the peptide in another monomer may be caused by the poor density map or the crystal package. The four residues P4\u2013P1 form an antiparallel \u03b2 sheet with residues 162\u2013166, and residues P5\u2013P4 form an antiparallel \u03b2 sheet on the other side with residues 188\u2013190 of the long loop A, that links domain II and III (Fig. 5(A)). The P1\u2032 to P3\u2032 strand extends into the solvent, and P2\u2032\u2013G forms a short antiparallel strand interaction with A26.",

The side chain of the conserved P1-Q fits comfortably in the pocket (Fig. 5(A)), stabilized by two hydrogen bonds: one between the N\u03b52 atom of H162 and the O\u03b51 atom of P1-Q and another between the side chain oxygen of E165 and the N\u03b52 atom of P1-Q (Fig. 5(B)). The main chain amides of G142 and A144 form an oxyanion hole that stabilizes the carbonyl oxygen of P1-Q. The main chain nitrogen atom of P1-Q forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of Q163. The S2 sub-site of PEDV 3CLpro consists of P188, L164, I51, S46 and H41, similar to that of TGEV 3CLpro, which is lined with the side chains of P188, L164, I51, T47 and H41 (Anand et al., 2002). The side chains of these residues form a hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate a P2 residue with a large side chain, such as leucine or methionine (Fig. 5(A)). The main chain of P3-V forms two hydrogen bonds with the main chain of E165, and the side chain of P3-V is exposed to the solvent (Fig. 5(A)). Since the side chain of P3 Val is pointing to the surface and therefore to the solvent, the charged character of the P3 residue has no difference or preference. The P4 pocket consists of a series of hydrophobic amino acids and may prefer residues with high hydrophobicity. A hydrogen bond is found between the main chain NH of P4-A and the carbonyl oxygen of T189. The PEDV 3CLpro S1\u2032 sub-site is composed of M25, A26, L27, C38, P39, H41 and V42. Small residues such as serine, glycine and alanine are preferred in the small S1\u2032 pocket. The main chain of P2\u2032-G forms two hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms of A26 (Fig. 5(B)). Due to the poor density of P3\u2032-F, its carbonyl group and the side chain phenyl group could easily be interchanged during structure refinement. The conservation in the substrate binding pockets provides a basic model for the design of potential antiviral agents (Yang et al., 2005). In the PEDV 3CLpro structure, the imidazole ring of H41 forms an abnormal conformation due to the low crystallization pH. However, in the complex structure of the active-site variant (C144A), the H41 imidazole ring is recovered (Fig. S1). The entire imidazole ring lies parallel with the side chain of P2-L and interacts through hydrophobic effects, and the N\u03b52 of 41 h becomes closer (3.3 \u00c5) to the peptide bond between P1-Gln and P1\u2032-Ser.",

Notably, the buried water molecule takes the place that is normally occupied by the side chain of D102 in the catalytic triad of the chymotrypsin and other members of this serine protease family. The oxyanion hole that stabilizes the main chain oxygen of P1-Q is made up of the main chain amides of G142 and A144. To determine whether the residues around the catalytic dyad are essential for hydrolytic activity, we performed proteolytic activity analyses of the variants (H41A, C144A, C144S, H162A and D186A). The results demonstrate that the fluorescence values of WT PEDV 3CLpro increase in a time-dependent manner, whereas none of the variants exhibit enzymatic activity (Fig. 6(B)). This finding indicates that the catalytic dyad of PEDV 3CLpro is essential for its proteolytic activity. Additionally, H162 and D186 in the substrate binding site are both essential, which are conserved among coronavirus 3CLpros (Fig. 1(B)).",

In addition to processing viral polyproteins, coronavirus 3CLpro has the potential to cleave host proteins during virus-host interactions. PEDV 3CLpro regulates its interferon antagonism by cleaving nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) essential modulator (NEMO) (Wang et al., 2016). The third fluorogenic peptide substrate (Dabcyl-KLAQLQ\u2193VAYHQE-Edans), which contains the cleavage site derived from NEMO was also applied in the cleavage assays. Both the proteases are able to cleave the two 3CLpro substrates and prefer the SARS-CoV 3CLpro-derived substrate; however PEDV 3CLpro demonstrates better hydrolysis efficiency than SARS-CoV 3CLpro (\nFig. 7(A)). Surprisingly, SARS-CoV 3CLpro is unable to cleave the NEMO-derived substrate, whereas PEDV 3CLpro shows efficient hydrolysis (Fig. 7(B)).

Each residue of \u201cKLAQLQ\u2193VAYHQE\u201d is preferred at the corresponding sub-sites of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, with the exception of the P1\u2032-V, which prefers small residues with side chain volumes of less than 50 \u00c53 (Ser; Ala; Cys) at the S1\u2032 sub-site (Chuck et al., 2010, Chuck et al., 2011). The PEDV 3CLpro S1\u2032 sub-site is composed of M25, A26, L27, C38, P39, H41 and V42, and those of SARS-CoV 3CLpro are T25, T26, L27, C38, P39, H41 and V42. The hydrophobic side chain of M25 may form hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of P1\u2032-V, which may lead to the tolerance of P1\u2032-V of PEDV 3CLpro. To verify the hypothesis, we replaced the whole motif with that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (\u201cRVCYGNMA\u201d19\u201326\u201cQVTCGTTT\u201d ) and also performed the point mutation M25T. It was confirmed that both the variants performed obvious cleavage of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro-derived substrate (data not shown); however, they failed to cleave the NEMO-derived substrate (Fig. 7(B)). It indicates that the motif (19\u201326), especially the M25 residue, is important for the cleavage of the NEMO-derived substrate by PEDV 3CLpro.

            "text": "In summary, we have determined the crystal structure of PEDV 3CLpro alone and in complex with a peptide substrate that contains the N-terminal cleavage site. The strategy for mimicking the peptide substrate side chains to accommodate the corresponding sub-sites can be utilized to design inhibitors (Yang et al., 2005). Thus, our structures may provide the basis for the design of inhibitors against PEDV 3CLpro. The biochemical and structural analyses revealed that PEDV 3CLpro forms a tight dimer, and no variants caused a dimer-to-monomer switch except the N-finger deletion variant. The interaction networks involved in dimer formation of 3CLpro are relatively well conserved among Alphacoronavirus but somewhat different from those of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in Betacoronavirus. Finally, we find that non-conserved motifs in the pockets cause different cleavage of substrate between the PEDV and SARS-CoV 3CLpros; we further analyzed the differences of the motifs between 3CLpros from Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus.\n",
