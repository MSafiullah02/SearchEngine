            "text": "Alpha interferons (IFN-\u03b1) are the first cytokines discovered. They are produced as a first line of defense against viral infection by inducing genes, including 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5-OAS), RNase L, guanylate binding protein, MxA protein and the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (Samuel, 2001), which interfere with viral replication and activate natural killer cells. IFNs play an important role in the host antiviral response but are also recognized for their antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities (Issacs and Lindenman, 1957, Fleischmann et al., 1998, Biron, 1998, Biron, 2001). They are encoded by an intronless multigene family, and widely distributed among the vertebrates, and share a same receptor. Multiple genes encoding IFN-\u03b1 subtypes have been identified in several mammalian species, including human, equine, bovine, canine and murine species (Roberts et al., 1998). More than 10 different subtypes of IFN-\u03b1 have been reported in mice and 15 or more subtypes in humans (Roberts et al., 1997, Roberts et al., 1998, Diaz et al., 1994).",

Except for man's encroachment on the territories of giant panda, diseases are probably the greatest threats. Although effective measures have been carried out to protect giant panda in breeding and reproduction, prevention and control of infectious diseases, especially virus diseases, it is still an arduous and pressing task. Recently, canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine adenovirus, minute virus, parainfluenza virus have been detected in giant panda (Tennant et al., 1993, He et al., 2000, Gao et al., 2003, Qiao et al., 2004). In China, Xia and He had separated canine distemper virus and coronavirus from liver of giant panda, respectively. Therefore, it is very important to study the immune system of giant panda, especially immune function genes. So we have cloned the genes coding for the IFN-\u03b1 and expressed them in eukaryotic cells and tested their biological activities which could be attributable to enhance the survival ability of giant panda.",

It was found that giant panda IFN-\u03b1 has 12 subtypes. The woodchuck IFN-\u03b1 proteins are encoded by a multigenic family composed of at least 10 subtypes (Berraondo et al., 2002). The reason for this redundancy remains unknown. Type I IFNs compete for common binding sites on human cells (Meager, 1998) and are believed to share a common receptor (Kunzi and Rowe, 2001). However, it seems that the different IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, although sharing some activities, have different functional profiles. Within the IFN-\u03b1 subfamily, genes are clustered by species, suggesting the possibility that IFN-\u03b1 genes have been duplicated independently. In the case of IFN-\u03b1, there is evidence that the IFN subfamily may have diversified adaptively in mammals. Existence of so many IFN-\u03b1 subtypes raises the question regarding whether there are biological differences among these proteins. Although IFN-\u03b1 subtype proteins from the same species are extremely homologous, differences in biological potency are often observed (Ortaldo et al., 1984, Mouchel-Vielh et al., 1992, Foster et al., 1996, Yeow et al., 1998, Baldwin et al., 2004). Different subtypes of huIFN-\u03b1 reveal various antiviral activities. HuIFN-\u03b18 was reportedly the most potent while huIFN-\u03b11 provided the least amount of antiviral activity (Foster et al., 1996). Several authors have reported that muIFN-\u03b14 was 5\u201310 times more active than muIFN-\u03b11 (Van Heuvel et al., 1986, Van Heuvel et al., 1988).",

Supernatants from transfected 293 cells were collected and analyzed. We demonstrated antiviral and antiproliferative activities of all AmIFN-\u03b1 subtypes, and observed that different subtypes had different activities. As reported for human IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, the differences in activities might be concerned with differences in receptor binding affinities (Aguet et al., 1984, Meister et al., 1986, Piehler and Schreiber, 1999, Yamaoka et al., 1999). Maybe subtle modification in the protein structure accounts for the variation in biological activities. As the activity of mouse IFN-\u03b1 (Van Pesch et al., 2004), our results showed a good correlation between the antiviral and antiproliferative potencies of the IFN subtypes.",
