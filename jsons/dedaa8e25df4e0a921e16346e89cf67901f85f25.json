It is to be found in the two pillars of modernity which arguably emerged with the articulation of dual allegiance expressed in Christianity. While not arguing for an exclusive Christian viewpoint of human security, taking the particular contributions of the influence of Christian ideas about God and the State into account does shed light on the secular constellation of Statehood which continues to be the building block of the international, State-based world order. Thus these dual allegiances refer not to those separate allegiances owed God and Caesar, but instead to the dual pillars of human and especially universal human rights. Here the first pillar refers to the conception of a deity in the arcane world, conveying a human right on the human creatures of the earth created in that image.",

At the same time, this belief afforded a strong upswing, even an infinite emotion, to universal ideals, according to which all human beings should be regarded as equal. For if there is only one god, then he can hardly be the god of one's own people alone. (H\u00f6sle 2003, 23) Pillars one and two together lead one step further even from the separation, referred to above, between the spheres of Caesar and of God. They coalesce into a demand upon the governing State, the secular Caesarian State, to uphold the universalistic morality demanded by Christianity. \"[Christianity] made possible a politics that was finally free of all religious and especially ritual considerations. \u2026Through an extremely intensive moralization of the religious, it demanded an influence on politics that went far beyond what was conceivable for the ancients\" (H\u00f6sle 2003, 24) .

This is not to argue that either universal human rights or a State guarantee of security is accepted or implemented. It is to assert that the originating impulses exist and permeate if not penetrate the status quo, which is arguably the ideal of the universality of human security.",

It was first explicitly named in the 1994 United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) report, New Dimensions of Human Security, yet built on a long tradition of sovereignty theory. The human security scaffold is predicated on the national responsibility to accept, promote, and protect the-ever-expanding-pantheon of those human rights. Nef (1999) and others count between five and seven dimensions of human security, each of them with echoes in the UN definitions of human, as well as political and social, cultural and economic rights. They are generally accepted as including: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security. Given both the vagary of their definitions and the vastness of their possible scope, with the sole exception of provisions of asylum tied to political (in)security, none of these human security elements are protected by legal provisions nationally, let alone internationally. Consequently, while these elements of human security 'rights' have benefited from a boundless imagination, the same cannot be said for the creativity applied to their realization, which remains the responsibility of the citizen-State.",

At the same time, the very legitimacy of the world order-State and NSAs all-is undergoing a shift: an uncoordinated stress test whose outcome is uncertain. Indeed, the State has also undergone a transformation. While the scope of human rights has expanded, that of States' rights has both expanded and contracted, at times retracting and contracting and at others effectually expanding (again): constrained first by the Cold War logic of mutually assured destruction (MAD); opened to new forms of government by the ideas of Foucault's 'governmentality' (Faubion and Rabinow 1994) and the 1990s' promulgation of issue-specific governance regimes that included NSAs (Rosenau 1992) ; seemingly eroded by the 'diffusion' of power (Guzzini and Neumann 2012) ; only to be recaptured in the emergence of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) of 2001 (ICISS 2001). On the one hand, myriad regulations and treaties curtail State maneuvering with regard to, among many others, the realm of international health crises through the International Health Regulations (IHR, updated 2005, brought into effect 2007). On the other, adaptations to States' continued (full) responsibility for the realization of human rights of their citizens continue to put the onus for an ultimate guarantee of human security (\u0160ehovic\u0301 2014) at their doorsteps. This is one side of the emergent challenge. The other is the void of imaginative beyond-State responses to the acceptance, promotion, and protection of the human rights' realization of non-citizens beyond borders.",

            "text": "Like the concept of human security itself, this book has the potential to become an unwieldy tome. In order to limit its remit, it will focus on delineating the definitions of human security juxtaposed against State security (defense) and in relation to health security and citizenship. In addition to the 1994 UNDP report, the argument builds on that of the Commission on Human Security, Human Security Now, (2003) , and the literature on the social determinants of health (Benatar 2011; Gill and Benatar 2016) . This in turn builds upon centuries of development of the argument that State has the responsibility to promote and protect the rights of its citizens, not only in terms of territorial integrity but also in terms of welfareincluding health (Gill and Benatar 2016) . Together, these link national and international human security, and are applicable to reimagining, for example, citizenship rights to health security beyond borders (Table 1.1 ). This illustrative nexus shows that just as global and international health diplomacy are differentiable, so, too, is international health security from global health security. Whereas the former emphasizes the security, primarily in the form of the protection of territory, of States, the latter prioritizes the health of people (in or between) any State. Yet regardless of whether State or human security is the ultimate goal, it is States which Health security-human security retain the status of the final arbiter of (any) security. This is because only States possess the necessary legal, procedural, and generally material capabilities of providing for and enforcing (human) security (\u0160ehovic\u0301 2014; \u0160ehovic\u0301 2017 forthcoming). Despite inputs and supplements and assumption of an increasingly diverse portfolio of roles and responsibilities both internationally and globally on the part of NSAs, whose numbers have exploded since the mid-to late 1990s, the centrality of States to the world order prevails. Indeed, internationally recognized Statehood continues to be a prerequisite for a seat at the rule-making table. Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot, quoted in her provocative interview entitled \"Europe needs to transcend the nation state\" (2016), goes so far as to ask: \"Why do we have a system in which we ask all the communities to become nation states first before joining a supranational entity?\" Though this is not the question to be answered in this book, it nonetheless represents a lens to the frame explored here. By holding the implicit presumption of a State-based international order up to the light, Gu\u00e9rot sets the stage for the question this book asks: In a world of imperfect State security, of porous borders, how might it be possible to reimagine establishing and protecting human security beyond borders?",

It is indisputable that the number and role of NSAs have increased exponentially since especially the end of the Cold War. A mountain of literature has contributed to the understanding of their assumption of responsibilities and potential and modes of accountability. Yet as the case studies, focused on human security vis-\u00e0-vis health and migration, show, the scope and depth of NSA involvement in, for example, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS response and governance wax and wane. Whether a trend, or a recurring cycle, can be identified remains to be seen. As such, it remains an open question whether the ultimate guarantee of responsibility for human security will rest with States, with NSAs, or with another form of governance.",

As such, health is a unique, local commodity, inextricably tied to communities and States. It is international insofar as its protection depends upon more than one State's actions. It is also increasingly being framed as global in practice: from the WHO through to the current focus on universal health coverage (UHC) and the Framework Convention for Global Health (FCGH). Health critically depends upon the implementation of systems based in and on State capabilities, notably with regard to services such as maternity care, as well as on surveillance at and across borders, as is the case with transnational threats such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H5N1 (avian influenza).",
