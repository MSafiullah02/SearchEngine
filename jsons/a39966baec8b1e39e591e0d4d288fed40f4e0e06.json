Eggimann et al. examined several ways to report healthcare-associated infection rates and suggested some caveats for benchmarking rates of VAP. In a prospective cohort of 1,068 medical ICU patients, 127 episodes of VAP developed in 106 (23.5%) of 451 mechanically ventilated patients. 10 The incidence of first episode of VAP was 22.8/1,000 patient-days; 29.6/1,000 patient days at risk, 35.7/1,000 ventilator days, and 44.0/1,000 ventilator days at risk. When considering all 127 episodes of VAP, infection rates increased from 22.8 to 27.3 episodes/1,000 ICU days and from 35.7 to 42.8 episodes/1,000 ventilator days. These data demonstrate the importance of the denominator chosen and may differ by as much as 40-60%. These rates have decreased in the past 3 years due to better prevention measures.",

            "text": "Crude mortality rates for VAP pneumonia range from 20 to 60%, reflecting, in large part, the severity of underlying disease, organ failure, and specific pathogen(s) and study populations. 1, 2, 6, 11, 12 In two major studies of VAP, the mortality rate varied between 4% in patients without prior antibiotic exposure to 73% in those with VAP due to MDR pathogens (e.g., P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii), and attributable mortality ranged from 6 to 14%. 13 Prevention programs for VAP are critically important for patient safety. Preventing VAP not only improves clinical outcomes, but also significantly reduces healthcare costs and liability. Rello et al. demonstrated that an average episode of VAP increased hospitalization by 12 days, mechanical ventilation by 10 days, ventilator days by 6 days, and ICU stay by 6 days at a hospital cost of $40,000; similar results have been reported from a suburban hospital by Warren et al. 12, 14 Pathogenesis Pathogenesis of HAP involves the direct interaction between the pathogen(s) with the host and epidemiologic variables that facilitate this dynamic. There are several mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of HAP, and the relative contribution of each pathway remains controversial and varies by population at risk and the infecting pathogen(s) (Fig. 29.1 ). 1, 2 Microaspiration in nonventilated patients is the primary route of bacterial entry into the lower respiratory tract. 1, 2 In addition, patients who are sedated, postoperative, or have abnormal swallowing are at higher risk for aspiration. 1, 2 Direct inoculation, bacteremic spread, or translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract are less common modes of acquisition. High concentrations of bacteria refluxed from the gastric reservoir or infected sinuses may be aspirated and increase levels of bacteria colonizing the oropharynx, but the relative contribution of these sites remains controversial. The current practice of maintaining patients in the semi-upright position, especially while providing enteral feeding, probably reduces the contribution of gastric colonization to VAP. Bacterial adherence and colonization of the oropharynx clearly are important for bacterial entry into the lower respiratory tract. 1, 15, 16 Colonization with gram-negative bacilli was present in 16% of moderately ill patients versus 57% of critically ill patients, and rates of pneumonia increased sixfold in ICU patients with bacterial colonization. Host factors, types of bacteria colonizing the pharynx, and the use of antibiotics may alter colonization and adherence of gram-negative bacilli. Oral epithelial cells rich in fibronectin bind gram-positive organisms, such as streptococci and S. aureus; conversely, those poor in fibronectin preferentially bind gram-negative bacilli such as P. aeruginosa. 16 In the mechanically ventilated patient, inhalation of aerosols, contaminated tubing condensate, leakage of bacteria, and oral secretions around the endotracheal cuff are routes of bacterial entry into the lower respiratory tract (Fig. 29.2) . 18, 19 In addition, local trauma and inflammation from the endotracheal tube increase tracheal colonization and reduce clearance of organisms and secretions from the lower respiratory tract. The development of biofilm-encased bacteria over time on the endotracheal tube lumen may increase the risk of bacterial embolization into the alveoli following suctioning or bronchoscopy 20 (Fig. 29. 3).",

            "text": "In mechanically ventilated patients, the stomach and gastrointestinal tract may contribute to oropharyngeal and tracheal colonization with gram-negative bacilli, although some investigators question their importance. 1, 15, [21] [22] [23] The stomach often is sterile when the pH is <2 because of the potent bactericidal activity of hydrochloric acid. An increase in gastric colonization occurs with achlorhydria, and various gastrointestinal diseases, malnutrition, or use of antacids or histamine-2 (H2) blockers. In mechanically ventilated patients, colonization may reach 1-100 million gram-negative bacilli/ml of gastric juice when the pH is >4. 23 2. An intubated patient with oropharyngeal colonization. Subglottic secretions pooled above the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff may leak around the cuff or be introduced directly into the trachea, resulting in either colonization. Depending on level of bacterial colonization, using semiquantitative samples of endotracheal aspirates (SQ-ETA) or quantitative-ETA, a diagnosis of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can be made. Quantitative diagnostic sampling of the alveolar space by bronchoscopic of non-bronchoscopic, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), or protected specimen brush (PSB) may also be used to diagnose VAP. NG: nasogastric tube. The pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infections often begins with tracheal colonization, which may progress to ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT), and, in selected patients, to VAP. 24, 25 In addition, discrimination between VAT and VAP may be difficult due to poor and overlapping definitions. VAT is defined as the presence of clinical signs of lower respiratory tract infection (fever, leukocytosis, and purulent sputum) with a quantitative endotracheal sputum sample with more than 106 organisms/ml of a respiratory pathogen, in the absence of a new or progressive infiltrate on chest X-ray ( Fig. 29.2 ). Monitoring endotracheal aspirates used to identify pathogens colonizing the lower airway is needed to diagnose and initiate early, appropriate antibiotic therapy. Recent data suggest that VAT appears to be an important risk factor for VAP and that targeted antibiotic therapy for VAT may be a new paradigm for VAP prevention and better patient outcomes. 24, 25 Immune Defenses in the Lung The response of pulmonary host defenses to invading microorganisms plays an integral part in the pathogenesis and outcome of infection ( Fig. 29.1 ). 2, 6, 26, 27 Mucociliary and mechanical clearances in the upper airway are important factors in the defense against infection. Bacterial antigens and cytokines that alter the activity and efficacy of ciliary cells in clearing bacteria from the lower airway need further study. The ability of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes to eliminate bacterial pathogens, and the interaction of these cells with inflammatory cytokines, probably play important roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Cell-mediated immune response is controlled by a complex array of lipids, peptides, and cytokines, including interleukin-1 and -2 interferons, growth factors, and chemotactic factors. Leukotrienes complement components, and platelet-activating factor also assist in the inflammatory response and contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumonia.",

            "text": "The wide spectrum of etiologic agents causing HAP/VAP varies by hospital, type of ICU, and patient population studied, emphasizing the importance of current local surveillance data 1, 2, 6, 9, 12, 28, 29 (Table 29 .1). Bacteria causing HAP/VAP may originate from various sources, including the patient's endogenous flora, other patients, staff, contaminated devices, or the environment. 7, 30, 31 Prior hospitalization, exposure to chronic care facilities, and antibiotic therapy also are important predisposing factors for MDR pathogens. [32] [33] [34] [35] In the absence of these factors, early onset HAP, occurring during the first 5 days of the hospital stay, is usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, or anaerobic bacteria ( Gram-negative bacilli have been implicated in more than 60% of reported episodes of HAP, and S. aureus (often MRSA) accounts for 20-40% of episodes but is increasing rapidly in the United States. 1, 5, 9 Isolation rates of these bacteria vary considerably depending on the population at risk, location, hospital size, ICU type, and method of diagnosis. However, overall rates of MDR pathogen infections are increasing rapidly in the United States and many other countries. 5, 37, 38 Most episodes of bacterial nosocomial pneumonia are caused by more than one species of bacteria because of aspiration or leakage of mixed bacterial flora from the oropharynx. 1, 2, 6, 12 More recently, pneumonia due to community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has emerged in children and adults. [39] [40] [41] [42] In contrast to healthcare-associated (HA)-MRSA, CA-MRSA isolates are genetically distinct and almost uniformly carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which may be associated with greater virulence. These strains also have been identified as an emerging source of infection spreading within hospitals. There is also concern over the evolution of vancomycin or glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (VISA/GISA) isolates of S. aureus that have been increasing. 39, 43 Diagnosis Accurate data regarding etiologic agents, epidemiology, and treatment of HAP/VAP are limited by the lack of a diagnostic gold standard. Although clinical criteria and semiquantitative sputum culture criteria for the diagnosis of VAP are the current standard for diagnosis in most hospitals, there are concerns about lack of diagnostic specificity. 2, 6, 44 Atelectasis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary emboli, neoplastic processes, and some autoimmune diseases can mimic HAP and VAP and, therefore, microbiologic diagnosis is critical. In addition, chest radiographic changes may be difficult to evaluate due to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or congestive heart failure, making the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia more difficult ( Fig. 29.4a, b) . The use of a computerized tomographic (CT) scan improves imaging but quality sputum samples for Gram stain and culture are also of paramount importance for providing clues to possible pathogens. Sputum may be produced spontaneously, induced by nebulized saline, or obtained by bronchoscopy in the non-intubated patient. For patients in mechanically ventilated ICUs, there has been considerable controversy regarding the benefits and risks of clinical diagnosis using semiquantitative evaluation of endotracheal aspirates versus quantitative cultures obtained from either bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (B-BAL) or protective specimen brush (B-PSB) or non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB (NB-BAL or NB-PSB). 2 These diagnostic approaches are discussed below.",

Moderate to heavy growth is most consistent with a diagnosis of VAT or VAP, especially if the Gram stain has many polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. The presence of bacteria on Gram stain (smear) correlates with 10 5 bacteria/ml by bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (BAL). Also, the morphology of the bacteria is a clue to the offending bacteria (i.e., gram-positive cocci in clusters suggest S. aureus and gram-negative bacilli may suggest Klebsiella spp, E. coli, or P. aeruginosa). It is also important to correlate these findings with aerobic culture results, because anaerobic cultures are not routinely performed. A Gram stain of sputum or tracheal aspirate without bacteria or inflammatory cells has a strong negative predictive value for VAP and may suggest another cause for the patient's fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrate on chest X-ray. Use of the endotracheal aspirates for the diagnosis of VAP allows prompt, empiric therapy, and may reduce mortality. However, it may not effectively separate lower airway colonization (purulent tracheobronchitis) from VAP (Table 29. 2). Semiquantitative criteria suggesting VAP are moderate to heavy growth.",

Growth below the threshold suggests colonization or contamination with some exceptions. For example, patients who have had a recent change in antibiotics may have a false-negative BAL/PSB, perhaps early VAP, inadequate BAL technique, or other causes, such as Legionella pneumophila, viruses, or anaerobic bacteria. However, the quantitative approach may improve de-escalation of antibiotics by targeting the specific pathogens that are causing VAP. In one large, prospective, randomized trial of 413 patients with suspected VAP, patients receiving invasive management compared to those managed clinically had a lower mortality rate at day 14 (16 and 25%; p = 0.02, but not at day 28), lower mean sepsis-related organ failure assessment scores (p = 0.04), and significantly more antibiotic-free days (11 \u00b1 9 vs. 7 \u00b1 7; p < 0.001). 47 Multivariate analysis demonstrated significantly reduced mortality (hazards ratio, 1.54 [CI, 1.10-2.16]; p = 0.01).

It has been shown that the shorter the time between diagnosis and initiation of treatment the better the impact on prognosis, length of hospital stay, and cost.

            "text": "Although vancomycin is considered the standard therapy for MRSA pneumonia, clinical trials and studies from different centers have reported clinical failure rates of greater than 40% with a standard dose of 1 g every 12 h. [64] [65] [66] This treatment failure may be related to inadequate dosing. 64 Many physicians have therefore tried to achieve a trough concentration of 15 mg/l or more, but without prospective clinical data supporting this practice. Combination therapy with rifampin, aminoglycosides, and other agents has been tried, but without well-documented value. 67 The use of continuous vancomycin infusions has not been proved to be advantageous compared with twice-daily dosing in severe MRSA infections. 68 Linezolid is another agent that has been used in the treatment of patients with MRSA VAP. Two large multicenter trials demonstrated equivalence to vancomycin in the treatment of these patients. 69, 70 When these studies were combined and analyzed by multivariate techniques, linezolid was associated with a better clinical cure and lower mortality. Although the superiority of linezolid over vancomycin needs further validation in randomized trials, it has higher lung penetration, as measured by epithelial lining fluid analysis when compared with vancomycin. 58, 71 Linezolid should be considered in patients with renal failure or a documented lack of response to vancomycin. Dosing vancomycin in patients with fluctuating renal function is difficult, and requires frequent monitoring of drug levels. Notably, the presence of renal insufficiency was a significant predictor of vancomycin failure in a multivariate analysis of patients with VAP, 69 and there is also concern about increased nephrotoxicity in patients receiving vancomycin and other nephrotoxic medications, such as aminoglycosides. 68, 72, 73 Other approved new agents for nosocomial MRSA infections are quinupristin/dalfopristin. Daptomycin should not be used in the treatment of MRSA pneumonia, as it was found inferior in clinical trials. Tigecycline has excellent activity against MRSA in vitro, and clinical studies of VAP are in progress. Ceftobiprole and dalbavancin also have in vitro activity against MRSA, but are not currently approved for use in the United States. [74] [75] [76] There are also new concerns over the emergence and rapid spread of a new strain of community-acquired MRSA that can cause serious pneumonia in healthy children and adults, and superinfection in individuals with influenza A virus infection. [77] [78] [79] Community-acquired MRSA has caused outbreaks in nursing homes, hospitals, schools, prisons, athletic teams, and the military. This strain may continue to spread in the community and is likely to become a major healthcare-associated pathogen. 39, 79, 80 Community-acquired MRSA isolates have increased virulence that may be related, in part, to the presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Furthermore, the combination of increasing hospital-acquired MRSA in healthcare settings and the rapid spread of community-acquired MRSA in selected high-risk populations and in acute and chronic healthcare settings requires close attention. Finally, the encapsulated pathogens S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, which may cause HAP, are common causes of bacterial superinfection following the yearly influenza outbreaks, and there is even greater concern over both hospital-acquired and community-acquired MRSA in the setting of a future bird flu pandemic. 81 Lack of Response to Initial Therapy In most patients, clinical improvement takes 24-48 h. Therefore, the selected antimicrobial regimen should not be changed during this time unless there is evidence of progressive deterioration. 84 used successfully a self-study module, in-service teaching programs that were coordinated with ICU staff meetings, along with fact sheets and posters, which were placed in the ICU and respiratory care departments. Rates of VAP dropped nearly 58%, and the cost savings were estimated to be between $425,606 and >$4,000,000. Babcock et al., using an extension of this program in an Integrated Health Care System, reported a 46% reduction in VAP over an 18-month period. 85 Staffing in the ICU is important, which is under-appreciated 1,4 , and must be sufficient for patient care and compliance with infection control practices. [85] [86] [87] Use of proper isolation techniques and effective infection control practices are cornerstones for prevention of HAP. 1, 7, 86 Infection control programs have repeatedly demonstrated efficacy in reducing infection and colonization due to MDR organisms. 1, 4, 30, [88] [89] [90] Unfortunately, staff compliance with proven infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, remains inconsistent in many hospitals. Also, surveillance of ICU infections to identify and quantify endemic and new MDR organisms with timely feedback of data is critical. 10, 88, [91] [92] [93] Timely communication of current data among clinicial, laboratory, pharmacy, and infection control staff is essential. Organism-specific strategies may need to be complemented by more aggressive eradication methods. 41, 43, 94 Studies are beginning to implicate the inanimate environment as an indirect contributor to pathogen acquisition. 86 Special interventions, including targeted environmental sampling and more aggressive environmental disinfection, may be indicated during outbreaks, particularly those involving MDR organisms or organisms that are more resistant to routine cleaning. 95 Antibiotic stewardship programs play an extremely important role in the overall effort to control healthcare-associated infections, reduce emergence of MDR organisms, and control spiraling healthcare costs. 96 Antibiotic stewardship should be focused, dynamic, and carefully monitored in order to adjust for specific MDR pathogens. 23, 97 An infectious disease pharmacist in the ICU, or a computerized decision support program to optimize drug regimens, has reduced inappropriate antibiotic use. 1, 2 By comparison, antibiotic cycling or rotation programs are more difficult to evaluate because of study design issues. 2,97-100",

In a randomized trial, DeRiso et al. demonstrated that the use of the oral antiseptic chlorhexidine (CHX) significantly reduced rates of hospital-acquired infections in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 113 Although topical antiseptics, such as chlorhexidine (CHX), provide an attractive alternative to antibiotics, the initial reported success in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery could not be confirmed by other studies. A recent study by Koeman et al. provides important data from a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of VAP outcomes for subjects treated with 2% CHX paste versus patients randomized to 2% CHX + 2% colistin (COL) paste to provide greater activity against gram-negative bacilli compared to placebo. 114 Compared to the placebo group, the daily risk of VAP was reduced by 65% in the CHX group (p = 0.01) and 55% in the CHX-COL group (p < 0.03). This impressive result for an inexpensive, nontoxic, topically applied modality warrants further attention, but is difficult to reconcile with the absence of effect on ventilator days, length of stay, or mortality. It is important to measure how prophylactic use of CHX and CHX-COL complement other effective prevention strategies, and resistance could become an important issue over time.",

No recommendation was made for topical prophylaxis. In a large study of SDD by de Jonge et al. in 2003, SDD was highly effective in preventing pneumonia without an increase in antibiotic resistance. 119 However, citing concerns over rapid increases in antimicrobial resistance in the hospital setting, coupled with the association between MDR pathogens and poorer patient outcomes, recent guidelines have suggested that SDD should be considered for selected ICU populations and in targeted clinical scenarios, but not be employed \"routinely\" for VAP prevention. 1, 2, 124 Since VAT appears to be a precursor to VAP, recently there has been greater interest in collecting serial endotracheal aspirates and using targeted antibiotic therapy to treat VAT as a method of preventing VAP and not delaying therapy in patients with chest X-rays that are difficult to interpret. 24, 25 Although these approaches need further investigation, they could be a new paradigm for early treatment, VAP prevention, and better patient outcomes.",

A large, randomized study of 1,509 patients intubated for more that 24 h compared the use of colloidal silver-coated ETT (Bard Pharmaceuticals) -designed to prevent endotracheal tube colonization and biofilm formation -to a conventional ETT. 127 Diagnosis of VAP required confirmation of VAP by a BAL \u00b3 10 4 organisms/ml.

Sucralfate has been used for stress bleeding prophylaxis, as it does not increase intragastric acidity or gastric volume, but is less effective in preventing gastrointestinal bleeding. 1, 2 Numerous randomized trials, using different doses and various study populations, have provided controversial results on the benefits of specific stress bleeding prophylaxis agents in relation to the increased risk of VAP and bleeding. 25, 145 One large randomized trial comparing antacids, H 2 blockers, and sucralfate reported no differences in rates of early onset VAP, but rates of late-onset VAP were lower in patients treated with sucralfate. 25 More recently, Bornstain et al. examined risk factors for early onset VAP (from 3 to 7 days) in 747 patients. 146 Several different variables were identified in the univariate analysis, but only sucralfate used in the first 48 h of ICU stay and unplanned extubation were predictors of VAP in the multivariate analysis, and antibiotics were protective. In an earlier multicenter study of VAP in patients with ARDS, sucralfate and duration of exposure to sucralfate were associated with an increased risk of VAP. 147 A recent, large, double-blind, randomized trial comparing ranitidine to sucralfate demonstrated a trend toward lower rates of VAP with sucralfate, but clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding was 4% higher in the sucralfate group. 145 Data indicate that H 2 blockers and protein pump inhibitors are associated with lower rates of gastrointestinal bleeding when compared to sucralfate, which may be doubly important, as transfusion also is a possible risk factor for VAP.",

Immediate administration of adequate antimicrobials is now considered a critical element in the effort to improve survival in HAP/VAP. The choice of the initial antibiotic regimen should be patient-oriented and guided by directed staining of respiratory samples. Prior hospitalization, presence of comorbidities, and the pressure of index cases are helpful indicators in order to anticipate the presence of MRSA, A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa. Local surveillance data and prior exposure to specific antibiotics (which should be avoided in the initial regimen) help in the choice of the initial antibiotic treatment. Antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted 48-72 h after the onset of pneumonia, based on a combination of quantitative respiratory cultures and resolution assessment. The duration of treatment should also be individualized; however, courses longer than 1 week are rarely justified.",
