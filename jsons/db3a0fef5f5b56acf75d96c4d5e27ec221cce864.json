The cultural differences are a risk factor to worsen the mental health of this already vulnerable population. The new coronavirus pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), which started in December 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China (Yang-Ron, 2020), has spread to other countries, damaging the routine and the mental health of the general population. However, this impact is being much more aggressive on the mental health of minority groups, especially on the indigenous population (PI). In this context, racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use have increasingly captured international attention (Moon et al., 2018) . Thus, the aim was to describe the mental health situation of the indigenous population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Furthermore, with the status of a COVID-19 pandemic, the contingent of health professionals is reduced both by the absence of workers because they are reduced, and by the resizing to meet the demands of the already overburdened health systems in the world.",

Moreover, to a concrete fear of death, the COVID-19 pandemic has implications for other spheres: family organization, companies and public places, changes in routines, isolation, leading to feelings of helplessness and abandonment (Ornell et al., 2020) . These negative feelings can exacerbate pre-existing mental problems. Compared with the general population in Canada, e.g., Aboriginal youth start smoking earlier, have a higher prevalence of smoking, have high rates of binge drinking and are more likely than non-Aboriginal youth to use marijuana (Elton-Marshall, Leatherdale and Burkhalter, 2011).",

This is an increase of 49.3% in relation to 2010. Of this amount, 17 million live in Mexico and 7 million in Peru (WHO, 2020). An estimated 798,365 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were in Australia, representing 3.3% of the total Australian population (Australian government, 2019), in America there are 5,2 million and Canada 2,13 million of indigenous. However, the countries with the highest proportion of indigenous population are Bolivia (62.2%), Guatemala (41%), Peru (24.0%) and Mexico (15.1%). Brazil, with 900,000 indigenous people, has the largest number of communities (305), followed by Colombia (102), Peru (85), Mexico (78) and Bolivia (39) (WHO, 2020).",
