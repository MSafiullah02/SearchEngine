N-Acetyl groups are present on various microbial surface glycans including peptidoglycan (van Heijenoort, 2001), chitin (Munro and Gow, 2001), lipopolysaccharide core regions (Rietschel et al., 1994), and some bacterial capsules (Altman et al., 1992). The classification of ficolins as lectins is controversial because ficolins can also bind to N-acetyl groups on various non-carbohydrate compounds (Frederiksen et al., 2005, Krarup et al., 2004, Brooks et al., 2003b) so some ficolin interactions with pathogens might be glycan independent.",

In humans, three ficolin proteins, H-ficolin, L-ficolin and M-ficolin, have been described (Teh et al., 2000, Le et al., 1998, Matsushita et al., 1996). Human plasma H-ficolin and L-ficolin bind and opsonize apoptotic cells (Honore et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2007, Kuraya et al., 2005) and necrotic cells (Honore et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2007) and can interact with DNA (Palaniyar et al., 2004, Jensen et al., 2007). Serum ficolin is reduced, while L- and H-ficolins are increased, in the placentas of women with preeclampsia, suggesting that ficolin might mediate a pro-inflammatory cascade (Wang et al., 2007). Ficolin-\u03b1 and ficolin-\u03b2, which were the first ficolins characterized, were cloned from a porcine uterus cDNA library (Ichijo et al., 1993). Ficolin \u03b1 is mainly a plasma protein produced in substantial amounts by the porcine liver (Ohashi and Erickson, 1998) but few microbial binding targets have been identified (Brooks et al., 2003b). Porcine ficolin \u03b2 is expressed in neutrophils and secreted when neutrophils are activated, but the binding functions of ficolin \u03b2 are unknown (Brooks et al., 2003c).",

Viral glycoproteins are often decorated with complex-type oligosaccharides, which are capped by two terminal GlcNAc residues (Ansari et al., 2006, Balzarini, 2007). Other related collagenous lectins bind surface glycoproteins on influenza A virus and human immunodeficiency virus (Ezekowitz et al., 1989), herpes simplex virus (Gadjeva et al., 2004) and non-enveloped rotavirus (Reading et al., 1998). MBL (Hartshorn et al., 1994, Kawai et al., 2007), SP-D (Hartshorn et al., 1997, Hawgood et al., 2004), SP-A (Hawgood et al., 2004, Benne et al., 1995) and bovine conglutinin (Kawai et al., 2007) inhibit influenza virus hemagglutination and infectivity, and MBL also promotes complement-mediated lysis of infected cells (Reading et al., 1995). In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that strains of influenza A virus vary with respect to their susceptibility to collectin-mediated neutralization and/or destruction; this variation relates to the level of glycosylation of the hemagglutinin molecule (Hartley et al., 1997).",

PRRSV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of 40\u201370 nm diameter, and undergoes a high rate of mutation underlying variations in antigen expression, plaque size, pathogenicity, and production of neutralizing antibodies (Rossow, 1998).

Marc-145 cells (Kim et al., 1993) were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Sigma, Oakville, Ont.).

Stocks of PRRSV (North American genotype strain PA8) (Wootton et al., 2000) were prepared in Marc-145 cells, and purified on sucrose cushion gradients. Specifically, Marc-145 cells were infected with PA8 stock at 200 TCID50 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The infected cell monolayers were then stored at \u221270 \u00b0C, and released from the cells by three freeze\u2013thaw cycles.

Centrifugation was performed at 90,000 \u00d7 \ng for 1 h to pellet the purified virus, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS. Neutralization of CPE was assayed in Marc-145 cells in 96-well plates infected with wild-type PRRSV (PA8) stock diluted in D-MEM to make 200 plaque-forming units (PFU) in a 50 \u03bcl volume. The diluted virus was pre-mixed with 0\u2013100 \u03bcg/ml of purified plasma ficolin in 50 \u03bcl volumes. Mixtures were then incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, and approximately 2 \u00d7 105 Marc-145 cells in 100 \u03bcl were added to each well.

Pig plasma (500 \u03bcl) or 100 \u03bcg of either affinity-purified pFCN or rFCN were incubated with 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria in 1.5 ml overnight at 4 \u00b0C.

All eluants were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE, and were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot, BioRad, Mississauga, Ont.) in a 25 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer, containing 100 mM glycine and 20% methanol, at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h at 100 V, and incubated overnight in PBS containing 5% BSA, to block non-specific binding. Bound ficolin was detected by immunoblots with polyclonal anti-ficolin antibody (pFCN and rFCN) or anti-V5 antibody (rFCN only). After incubation with primary antiserum for 1 h, immunoblots were washed twice for 15 min in PBS containing 0.01% Tween-20 (PBS/Tween) and incubated for 45 min in a 1:5000 diluted secondary antibody, peroxidase-labelled goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG, H + L (Biomeda Corp, Foster City, CA).

Similarly, pFCN (0.001\u201310 \u03bcg/ml) had a significant (p\n < 0.0001) dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the numbers of PRRSV lytic plaques induced in Marc-145 cells (Fig. 2\n). The mean viral titer of 10.4 \u00d7 105/ml, as assayed by plaque counts in the presence of 0 \u03bcg/ml pFCN, was reduced to 8.25 \u00d7 105/ml in the presence of only 0.001 \u03bcg/ml of pFCN (p\n < 0.01). The greatest reduction in the formation of infectious viral particles detected in the plaque assay was observed in the presence of 10 \u03bcg/ml of pFCN, where the infectious mean viral titer was reduced to 1.45 \u00d7 105/ml (p\n < 0.0001).

Immunoreactive pFCN bound PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner (p\n < 0.0001), but binding above background levels was only obtained at higher concentrations (10 and 100 \u03bcg/ml of pFCN). When pFCN was pre-incubated with either 100 mM GlcNAc or 10\u22124 anti-ficolin antibody, the amounts of immunoreactive ficolin bound to PRRSV-coated wells was reduced at ficolin concentrations of 10 \u03bcg/ml (p\n < 0.001) and 100 \u03bcg/ml (p\n < 0.0001) (Fig. 3).",

These do not react in Western blots with anti-ficolin antibodies that were raised against the major ficolin subunit extracted from PAGE lanes (DeLay, 1999). However, we were concerned that some of the PRRSV neutralizing effects of purified pFCN might result from contaminants that co-purified from plasma (e.g. ficolin \u03b2, IgM, mannan-binding lectins, etc.), so we prepared recombinant porcine ficolin \u03b1 (rFCN) and purified it by nickel- and GlcNAc-affinity chromatography. The recombinant porcine ficolin \u03b1 was cloned into a mammalian expression vector and produced in CHO K1 cells in order to enhance protein glycosylation and folding, similar to that of the native protein. Recombinant ficolin \u03b1 (rFCN) purified by affinity chromatography from culture supernatants of transfected CHO K1 cells contained an approximately 44 kDa reduced band (Fig. 4A, lane 2) that was consistent with porcine ficolin \u03b1 by MALDI-TOF trypsin fragment mass fingerprint (5 peptides at 894.3856, 1045.474, 1123.5258, 1618.7651, 3069.4492) with over 95% confidence. The \u223c44 kDa immunoreactive band that migrated just above pFCN was detected on immunoblot with anti-ficolin antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 2). As expected, only rFCN was detected by anti-V5 antibody that recognized the C-terminal tag of the recombinant protein (Fig. 4B, lane 4). The addition of the TEV protease recognition site (ENLYFQG), V5 epitope (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) and 6 histidine residues on the recombinant protein likely accounts for the apparent molecular weight difference between pFCN and rFCN. Affinity-purified preparations of porcine plasma ficolins contain additional bands at 29 and 81 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 1) consistent with heavy and light chains of IgM, as described previously (Brooks et al., 2003b). An additional band of \u223c65 kDa is noted in the rFCN preparations and cross-reacts with both anti-ficolin and anti-V5 antibodies (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4). When separated by non-denaturing (native) PAGE, both pFCN and rFCN preparations contained high molecular weight bands consistent with formation of higher-order oligomers (Fig. 5\n) (Brooks et al., 2003b). pFCN preparations (lane 3) contain a band at approximately 800 kDa as well as an additional band at approximately 1000 kDa, while rFCN preparations (lane 5) reveal multiple bands from approximately 750\u2013850 kDa (Fig. 5). Lanes 1 and 2 are molecular weight markers specifically for non-denaturing gels (Amersham Biosciences), while lane 4 contains GlcNAc-affinity-purified recombinant Lac Z CHO K1 supernatant, which was loaded as a negative control, as it was not expected to bind GlcNAc.",

This suggests that ficolin may have the ability to neutralize PRRSV and reduce its replication but the biological significance of such ficolin binding is still unknown. Ficolin binding and neutralization of PRRSV in these in vitro studies occurred in concentration ranges (1\u2013100 \u03bcg/ml) that correspond to concentrations of 10\u201380 \u03bcg/ml that have been reported for plasma ficolins in pigs (Ohashi and Erickson, 1998, Seebaransingh, 1999). The cytopathic effect, lytic plaque effect and direct binding to PRRSV were all reduced substantially in the presence of purified plasma ficolin and recombinant ficolin \u03b1, and these effects were counteracted by GlcNAc. This indicates that the inhibitory activity of ficolin is dependent on its N-acetyl-binding functions (Krarup et al., 2004, Brooks et al., 2003a).",

However, we produced recombinant porcine ficolin \u03b1, and showed that it had similar inhibitory and binding effects as we observed with pig plasma ficolins, and these were similarly inhibited by GlcNAc and ficolin-specific antiserum. The preparation of recombinant ficolin \u03b1 (rFCN) was functionally similar to plasma-purified ficolin \u03b1 (pFCN) because it was purified from culture supernatants by GlcNAc affinity chromatography, and it was similarly eluted with GlcNAc from A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5b (APP 5b) and S. enteritidis.",

However, electrophoretic mobility under reducing conditions differed between pFCN and rFCN, likely due to the C-terminal tag on rFCN that was designed for additional antibody detection, specific for the recombinant form. On 2D-PAGE, rFCN was observed as \u223c44 kDa (3 spots in pI 5.5\u20135.7) compared with \u223c40 kDa for pFCN (5 spots in pI 5.2\u20136.0) (Brooks et al., 2003a, Brooks et al., 2003b). The narrower apparent migration of rFCN on the second dimension is suggestive of a difference in the glycosylation, since treatment of pFCN with N-glycosidase reduces the number and shape of ficolin spots on 2D gels but does not interfere with its GlcNAc-dependent binding (Brooks et al., 2003b). Inadequate glycosylation of recombinant proteins can impair protein folding and function (Bhatia and Mukhopadhyay, 1999), therefore an additional comparison between pFCN and rFCN was conducted to determine if the recombinant form had similar functions to native plasma-purified ficolin. pFCN selectively binds Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5b (APP 5b) and Salmonella enteriditis (S. enteriditis) (Brooks et al., 2003a, Nahid and Sugii, 2006), and is elutable with GlcNAc; rFCN could also bind these bacterial species in a GlcNAc-dependent manner.",

            "text": "The PRRSV genome encodes six structural proteins which include membrane glycoproteins GP2, GP3, GP4, and GP5. The functions of GP 2 through 5 are still largely unresolved, although GP5 has been shown to be necessary for proper viral assembly (Wissink et al., 2004). Both GP2 and 5 contain two predicted N-glycosylation sites that are highly conserved between North American and European strains of PRRSV. GP5 contains high-mannose type sugars and complex-type sugars with terminal GlcNAc residues while the remaining envelope glycoproteins contain complex N-glycans at various asparagine residues (Ansari et al., 2006). GP3 is the most glycosylated protein with seven N-linked glycosylation sites that are highly conserved (Wissink et al., 2004). Ficolin \u03b1 may bind one or more of the terminal GlcNAc residues that decorate the PRRSV envelope glycoproteins, inhibiting viral entry into alveolar macrophages and thereby reducing infection. Other collagenous lectins have been reported to have antiviral effects related to direct binding and virus neutralization (Hartshorn et al., 1997, Reading et al., 1997, Ezekowitz et al., 1989, Reading et al., 1998, Kawai et al., 2007, Haurum et al., 1993b, Haurum et al., 1993a), including SP-A and SP-D, which can bind to the G-protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in a carbohydrate-dependent manner (Ghildyal et al., 1999, Hickling et al., 2000, Hickling et al., 1999). In vivo relevance is suggested as SP-A-deficient mice suffered more severe RSV infections with severe pneumonia and impaired superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by alveolar macrophages (LeVine et al., 1999). If these mice were supplemented with exogenous SP-A together with RSV inoculation, the infection was less severe, comparable to that seen in controls (LeVine et al., 1999). Alternatively, ficolins could bind PRRSV and enhance presentation of the virus to macrophages, thereby enhancing viral infection, and likely exacerbating the disease pathogenesis. MBL binding to HIV was shown to enhance inflammation and HIV replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Heggelund et al., 2005, Ji et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Some lectins derived from various species are currently being considered as anti-viral drugs. Lectins with anti-HIV activity have been of particular interest, and have been isolated from cyanobacteria (Bokesch et al., 2003, Lagenaur and Berger, 2005), sea coral (Kljajic et al., 1987), algae (Mori et al., 2005), and a number of plants (Balzarini et al., 2004, Balzarini et al., 2005). The carbohydrate specificity is predominantly to high-mannose and GlcNAc residues (Keyaerts et al., 2007, Balzarini, 2006). Plant lectins that recognize mannan or GlcNAc terminal residues have been reported to have antiviral effects against coronaviruses such as SARScoV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Keyaerts et al., 2007). The antiviral effects appeared to target either initial viral attachment to host cells, or viral release following a replicative phase (Keyaerts et al., 2007). Recently, the commensal Lactobacillus jensenii was engineered to express an HIV-binding cyanobacterial lectin (cyanovirin) at high levels, in order to deliver and maintain an active antiviral protein in the vaginal mucosa, preventing HIV transmission (Liu et al., 2006, Lagenaur and Berger, 2005).",

While the mechanism is still unknown, the results in this study suggest that ficolin can bind to N-acetylated glycans on the viral surface and inhibit infection.

A better understanding of the mechanisms by which ficolins influence viral infection and disease might lead to new antiviral interventions.",
