Although physician burnout 39 and increased cynicism in medicine have made it difficult at times for some to clearly envision 40 this purpose, humanitarian medical work offers benefit both to the practitioner and the patient in 41 many ways [1] .

            "text": "Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons Membership Humanitarian Efforts 74 75 While training in hip and knee arthroplasty did not prepare our community to care directly for 76 patients affected with COVID-19, many American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons 77 (AAHKS) members and their partners have found ways to contribute. Orthopaedic surgeons and 78 practices have been offloading local emergency rooms (ERs) with non-urgent orthopedic 79 problems to decompress the acute care setting. Others have been partnering with local, national, 80 and global organizations or volunteering their services on the front lines. Individuals are making 81 and donating personal protective equipment (PPE) and helping protect those on the front lines. 82 Operation Walk chapters across the country have donated more than 13,000 masks, 15,000 pairs 83 of gloves, hundreds of gowns, disinfectant wipes, and head and shoe covers to hospitals here and 84 abroad fighting COVID-19. Many of these donations come directly from supplies that had been 85 donated or bought for future trips. More than one chapter had already shipped their equipment in 86 preparation from an upcoming trip. These chapters have informed their partner countries that 87 they can use the supplies for their own battle with COVID-19. 88 89 Denver's Operation Walk chapter has also found other ways to contribute to their local 90 community and beyond. Team members have formed a community outreach for answering non-91 urgent phone calls about COVID-19 and other health concerns. Like many groups they are 92 helping off load the local ERs by offering telehealth visits and even a drive up orthopaedic 93 \"check\" for non-emergent problems. Several of their nurse team members have deployed to work 94 in the intensive care units in New York City. These team members as well as all nurses at their 95 local hospital have been outfitted with Operation Walk Denver backpacks filled with hand 96 sanitizer, lotion, nutrition bars, and bottled water. \"The entire team has learned to adapt and 97 improvise during op walk trips and this enable us to all proceed with confidence and find ways to 98 provide excellent care under strained circumstances,\" noted Peggy Kettler, Logistics Coordinator 99 for Operation Walk Denver. Dr. Victoria Brander, medical director of Operation Walk Chicago, 100 was recruited to help coordinate the COVID-19 testing in an underserved area of Chicago given 101 her experience with international humanitarian care. 102 103 Women Orthopaedist Global Outreach had to cancel their April Operation Walk trip to Guyana 104 but donated their supplies to several hospitals across the country. They have partnered with 105 Souls4Soles to assist in organizing locations to ship comfortable medical shoes to front line 106 health care workers. In Nashville, Walk Strong Foundation, in partnership with Project Cure, 107 donated more than 30,000 gloves, 17,000 masks including 500 N95 masks, and other PPE 108 equipment. Project Cure is one of many partnerships forged by our members to assist in their 109 humanitarian endeavors. They are the largest distributor of donated medical equipment globally. 110 For the last four weeks they have redirected all their PPE to hospitals around the country, with 111 over 110 donations to date including 15 ventilators. 112 113 More than 10 partner countries have been affected by the cancelling or postponement of 114 orthopaedic mission trips. These include Nicaragua, India, Guyana, Panama, Honduras, Cuba, 115 Guatemala, Ghana, Bolivia, Mexico, and Jamaica. These countries have had to suspend non-116 urgent orthopaedic cases, affecting their patients and their resident education. Although poorly 117 equipped with the necessary PPE, Dr. David Samaroo, the head of orthopaedic surgery at 118 Georgetown Hospital in Guyana, believes his experience with Op Walk missions will help his 119 team. \"We are learning and doing new things. Our previous experiences dealing with numbers, 120 large volumes, like we did in the past two Operation Walk missions has really helped.\" In Vera 121 Cruz Mexico, Dr. Octavio Amador says his team's experience working for years with Walk 122 Strong Foundation has given them a \"can do\" mentality in any situation. His nurses have been 123 confident creating their own PPE (Figure 1). 124 125 The Role of the Hip and Knee Surgeon in COVID-19 126 127 Although we may not be in the front lines of this battle, as orthopaedic surgeons we still can fill a 128 need in midst of this pandemic and resource shortage. As hip and knee surgeons we have 129 experienced massive practice disruptions including cancellations of all elective procedures, 130 almost non-existent in-person office visits, and sparing use of ER services. Several health 131 system-wide changes have been implemented across the United States, with a few themes having 132 emerged as essential for orthopaedics to manage the current situation. 133 134 Throughout this pandemic, we must focus on protecting patients and staff. For patients that still 135 need to be evaluated in clinic, staggered visit times and staggered X-ray schedules assisted with 136 the mandate of social distancing. A detailed protocol including temperature and risk screening 137 for all patients and staff was necessary to decrease the spread. Patients that screened-in for 138 COVID-19 were given a surgical mask and placed in a separate part of the clinic. Staff that were 139 symptomatic remained at home; if they presented for work and screened-out for COVID-19, they 140 wore a surgical mask and practiced standard hand hygiene at all times. 141 142 In addition to the precautions mentioned above, the widespread use of telehealth services has 143 been facilitated by the passing of the CARES act from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 144 Services [4]. Most older patients have opted for connecting via telephone, while others were 145 enthusiastic to download an application and video conference with their surgeon. Although a 146 physical exam cannot be performed, patients have appreciated connecting with their surgeon 147 during this time of uncertainty. As important as it has been to protect the health of our patients 148 and keep them away from the hospital unless absolutely necessary, addressing the mental well-149 being of our patients has been just as important, as we are all enduring this together. 150 151",

At this point 178 the societal and financial impact are incalculable. While we can learn from past experience and 179 make projections when the disease will peak, this is a different virus and the world is a much 180 different place than in past pandemics.
