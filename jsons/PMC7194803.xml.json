Our results showed that ribavirin at high concentrations may induce a significant increase of IL-2 production. It should be noted that a unique feature of lymphocytes is that their activation itself triggers feedback mechanisms that limit their proliferation and differentiation. One of this mechanisms is IL-2-mediated feedback regulation. IL-2 is the prototypical T cell growth factor and functions in a paracrine manner to stimulate clonal expansion of antigen-stimulated lymphocytes and \u201cbystander\u201d cells. Early in a T cell response, when IL-2 concentrations are low, the proliferative effect may be dominant, but when the cytokine accumulates, it may function to terminate the response.14 Therefore, high IL-2 levels enhance FAS-mediated apoptosis of T-cells and other activation feed-back control mechanism that activate termination of T-cell immune response.12 In agreement with our observations, Martin et al. reported that high concentrations of ribavirin markedly increase secretion of IL-2 and suppressed IFN-\u03b3 production in cultured PBMC from chronic hepatitis C patients.15\n",
