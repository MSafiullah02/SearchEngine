            "text": "Recently, considerable attention has been focused on thymus-derived CD4 \u0609 regulatory T cells that constitutively express CD25 and have a contact-dependent, cytokine-independent mechanism in vitro. However, peripheral CD4 \u0609 and CD8 \u0609 T cells can also be induced to become regulatory T cells. Here we review our studies using the combination of IL-2 and transforming growth factor \u2424 (TGF-\u2424) to generate regulatory T cell subsets ex vivo, and the work of others using IL-10 to induce suppressive activity. Under certain conditions, the autocrine effects of TGF-\u2424 and IL-10 induce peripheral T cells to produce immunosuppressive levels of each of these cytokines. This effect of TGF-\u2424 is IL-2 dependent. Under other conditions IL-2 and TGF-\u2424 can induce CD4 \u0609 cells to develop potent contact-dependent, cytokine-independent regulatory activity. At present, there is considerable confusion concerning the mechanism of action of CD4 \u0609 CD25 \u0609 cells because cytokineproducing regulatory T cells generated in the periphery can express CD25 and other markers displayed by naturally occurring, thymus-derived regulatory T cells. We, therefore, propose a nomenclature that identifies thymus-derived and peripheral regulatory cells, and that also differentiates T regulatory cells from T helper cells. Because T regulatory cells broadly control T helper cell reactivity, the mechanisms that control regulatory cell function are also reviewed. Finally, the potential use of regulatory T cells generated ex vivo as an adoptive immunotherapy for certain autoimmune diseases, to prevent organ graft rejection, or to prevent pathologic host responses to infectious agents is discussed.",

Recently, however, the importance of these cells in autoimmunity and transplantation tolerance has been rediscovered and has led to a renaissance in their investigation [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .

A lack of appreciation of the heterogeneity of CD25 \u03e9 cells has led to a controversy concerning the role of TGF-\u2424 in the mechanism of action of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 Tr cells. Some groups have described latent TGF-\u2424 bound to the cell surface of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells and consider this cytokine important in the mechanism of action [20, 21] . Others, however, deny a role for TGF-\u2424 in the mechanism of action since the suppressive activity of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells is intact in mice that are genetically unable to produce or respond to TGF-\u2424 [22] . Unfortunately, there are no markers that distinguish the naturally occurring, thymus-derived CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 subset (Trn) from activated, TGF-\u2424-producing Tr cells generated in the periphery. Because the relative percentages of Trn cells and Tr2 cells may vary in different lymphoid organs, we suspect that the present controversy regarding the role of TGF-\u2424 in the mechanism of action of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells is attributable to a heterogeneity of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells studied, as well as differences in the experimental methods used.

The T cells selected include low-affinity TCR self-reactive T cells and highaffinity TCR self-reactive natural CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 T regulatory cells (Trn). Both conventional and Trn are exported to the periphery where they respond to specific antigens. Conventional CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 cells become either specific T helper or T regulatory cell subsets depending upon the affinity of their TCR to antigen, the strength of the costimulatory signals provided by antigen-presenting cells, and the cytokine milieu. Specific subsets of T helper cells and T regulatory cells each produce a characteristic profile of cytokines. Th1 cells and Th2 cells produce predominantly IFN-\u2425 or IL-4 while Tr1 and Tr2 cells produce predominantly IL-10 or TGF-\u2424. Trn have a cytokine-independent, contact-dependent mechanism of action in vitro.

We consider that the various populations of Tr cells constitute an interacting network for the following reasons. First, CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 Trn cells facilitate the generation of Tr1 cells and Tr2 cells by a phenomenon known as \"infectious tolerance\" [25] [26] [27] . Second, while Trn cells primarily target CD8 \u03e9 cells and prevent them from becoming activated and developing cytotoxic activity [28, 29] , our laboratory has found that CD8 \u03e9 Tr cells primarily target CD4 \u03e9 cells and prevent their expansion following antigenic stimulation [30] . The converse was also true; CD8 \u03e9 Tr cells were not as potent as CD4 \u03e9 Tr cells in suppressing CD8 \u03e9 cells. Therefore, although the functional activities of all Tr subsets overlap, we suggest that each probably targets certain cell populations. Finally, our view that Tr subsets can be grouped into specific subsets must be viewed with some caution. The properties of the various Tr subsets described to date have been elucidated from in vitro studies. One cannot exclude the possibility that Trn cells or the Trnlike cells described herein, which have cytokine-independent mechanism of action, become cytokine-producing cells following adoptive transfer in vivo.",

Antigen-presenting cells (APC), dendritic cells (DC) in particular, have a major role in T cell differentiation. DC1 and DC2 subsets control the generation of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively [36] . Some workers have proposed that another dendritic cell subset (DC r ) that secretes IL-10 rather than IL-12 directs na\u00efve T cells to a Tr1 subtype [36, 37] .

These cytokines that decrease expression of costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (Fig. 1 ). CD4 \u03e9 cells become Tr1 cells when repeatedly stimulated with IL-10 or with immature dendritic cells. These IL-10-producing Tr1 cells have strong suppressive effects, both in vitro and in vivo [14, 15, 39] . CD8 \u03e9 cells activated by immature dendritic cells also become Tr1 cells [24, 40] . The role of IL-10 in their mechanism of action appears pivotal because neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibodies completely block the generation of Tr1 cells [24] . In all examples, the IL-10-conditioned CD4 \u03e9 T cells became unresponsive to antigen and lost the capacity to produce IL-2. In addition to producing high levels of IL-10, they also produced moderate amounts of TGF-\u2424 and low levels of Th1 or Th2 cytokines [14] . Tr1 cells suppressed the activation of cocultured T cells in an antigen nonspecific fashion.

While TGF-\u2424 inhibits the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells [46, 47] , this cytokine induces at least 3 Tr subsets through positive effects on cell growth and differentiation. Our laboratory has reported that with a sufficient amount of IL-2 to counteract its suppressive effects, TGF-\u2424 has costimulatory effects on CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 cells. These effects enhance the proliferation and survival of human T cells that develop potent suppressive activities [23, 29] . TGF-\u2424 has been reported to considerably enhance the proliferation of mouse CD8 \u03e9 cells [48] . This cytokine enhances human CD4 \u03e9 cell expression of CD25, CTLA-4, CD40L, and TNFRII [29, 49] . TGF-\u2424 increases TNF-\u2423 production by both CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 cells [49] . TGF-\u2424 accelerates activationinduced cell death of some T cells [50, 51] but protects others from apoptosis [52, 53] . Thus, TGF-\u2424 not only has inhibitory effects on T cell and B cell function but can induce several Tr subsets with the potential to suppress immune-induced inflammation [54] .",

Mouse CD8 \u03e9 cells stimulated with staphylococcal enterotoxin B and TGF-\u24241 secreted increased levels of TGF-\u2424 and IL-10 and inhibited the proliferation of other T cells [55] . Independently, we learned that TGF-\u2424 had an important role in the generation of human CD8 \u03e9 suppressor cells. Using a model in which we could induce T cell-dependent antibody production without accessory cells, we found that CD4 \u03e9 cells, by themselves, could not induce CD8 \u03e9 cells to suppress antibody production. The addition of NK cells to the cultures, however, led to potent suppressor activity. Subsequent studies revealed that NK cells produced active TGF-\u2424 when they interact with CD8 \u03e9 cells, and this cytokine was needed for CD8 \u03e9 cells to become suppressors of antibody production [56, 57] . In other studies, a brief exposure of CD8 \u03e9 cells to IL-2 and TGF-\u2424 led to potent suppressive activity. In unpublished studies, we have found that the suppressive activity is of CD8 \u03e9 cells is cytokine dependent and that neutralizing anti-TGF-\u2424 monoclonal antibodies sometimes, but not always, abolishes suppressive activity. Because others have shown that CD8 \u03e9 suppressor cells can produce IL-10 and TGF-\u2424 [24, 55] , it is likely that both cytokines have an important role in the suppressive effects of these cells.",

Recent studies from our laboratory have revealed that stimulation of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03ea cells with low-dose staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and TGF-\u2424 induces a CD25 \u03e9 Tr subset that produces TGF-\u2424, but not IL-2, IFN-\u2425, or IL-10 [23] . The addition of 5% of these CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells markedly suppressed T cell-dependent antibody production by a mechanism that was TGF-\u2424 dependent. Anti-TGF-\u2424 completely blocked the suppressive activity of these cells. The cytokine profile and mechanism of action of this subset, therefore, was clearly distinguishable from other Tr subsets. Moreover, TGF-\u2424 not only was responsible for the generation of this Tr subset, but it protected them from apoptosis upon further stimulation. Interestingly, the low dose of SEB used to induce T cell activation stimulated CD4 \u03e9 CD45RO \u03e9 cells, but not the CD45RA \u03e9 na\u00efve subset. This result suggests that we had induced CD4 \u03e9 previously activated effector or memory cells to develop regulatory activity. Further studies will be performed to learn whether T cells previously polarized to become Th1 or Th2 cells can become Tr2 cells. Others have described a small subset of mouse CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03ea cells that express the latent form of TGF-\u2424 on their cell surface, and these cells have suppressive activity mediated by this cytokine [62] . It is likely that the autocrine effects of TGF-\u2424 have induced these lymphocytes to become Tr2 cells.",

We agree with Papiernik and co-workers who have suggested that IL-2 has an essential role in the generation of suppressor T cells [63] . Although IL-2 was originally described as a T cell growth factor, mice with a deficiency of this cytokine or a functional IL-2 receptor develop a lethal lymphoproliferative and autoimmune syndrome [64 -67] . This syndrome can be corrected directly by the adoptive transfer of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells, or indirectly by the transfer of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03ea cells. Presumably, the latter provide the IL-2 that is needed for the generation of the suppressor cells. An aggressive lethal lymphoproliferative and autoimmune syndrome also occurs in TGF-\u24241 knockout mice [68] . Nonetheless, CD4 \u03e9 suppressor cell precursors apparently develop in both IL-2 and TGF-\u24241deficient mice. IL-2 signaling enables CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 from IL-2-deficient mice to develop suppressive activity [69] . Similarly, CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells from TGF-\u24241-deficient mice can suppress wild-type T cells [22] . In this case the wild-type antigen-presenting cells could serve as a source of TGF-\u2424. Thus, both IL-2 and TGF-\u24241 could be maturation factors for suppressor cell precursors. While IL-2 would promote the growth of these cells, TGF-\u2424 would protect them from activation-induced apoptosis.",

Blazar and co-workers have shown that the suppressive effects of TGF-\u2424 and IL-10 added together is greater than each acting alone [71, 72] . We have confirmed these observations in unpublished studies. Groux and co-workers have reported one mechanism that involves this synergy. They found that newly activated T cells avoid the inhibitory effects of TGF-\u2424 by down-regulating the signal transducing TGF-\u2424 receptor (TGF-\u2424RII) [73] ; this would enable T cells to respond optimally to microbial antigens. This finding is consistent with our observation that the addition of TGF-\u2424 to T cells more than 24 h after they are activated markedly diminishes their ability to become suppressor cells [56, 57] . Remarkably, Groux et al. reported that IL-10 is responsible for the re-appearance of TGF-\u2424RII [73] . Thus, the late appearance of IL-10 after the peak of T cell activation restores the sensitivity of these cells to TGF-\u2424. In this manner, the combined inhibitory effects of IL-10 and TGF-\u2424 act together to terminate T cell activation.",

Thus, a defect in the production of IL-10 or TGF-\u2424 can have deleterious consequences. For example, there is a marked imbalance of IL-10 and TGF-\u2424 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Levels of IL-10 are high, while lymphocyte production of TGF-\u2424 is decreased [79, 80] . This imbalance may strongly contribute to dysregulated polyclonal B cell activation characteristic of SLE. In autoimmune pancreatitis, a loss of TGF-\u2424 signaling accelerates the progression of this disease [81] .

Two such regulatory mechanisms have been described. The first concerns the strength of the activating signal. Baecher-Allan and co-workers have shown that strongly activated T cells are refractory to the inhibitory effects of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 Tr cells [83] . Thus, Tr cells could not block T cells from responding to potent microbial antigens but could inhibit a weaker response to self-antigens. The second mechanism involves the innate immune system. Both antigen-presenting cells and CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells express Toll-like receptors (TLR-4). These pattern receptors are triggered by microbial products. The resulting signals induce antigen-presenting cells to produce IL-6 and other cytokines, which block the suppressive effects of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 Tr cells, thereby, allowing T cells to respond maximally to the infectious agent [84] . Triggering TLR-4 expressed by CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 cells markedly enhances the proliferation and suppressive activity of these regulatory T cells [85] . Thus, when levels of IL-6 fall, an expanded population of Tr cells are ready to terminate the response.",

The prime candidates are diseases characterized by spontaneous exacerbations and remissions such as systemic lupus and inflammatory bowel disease. Here, Tr cells induced with polyclonal T cell activators can be tested. For diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, antigen-specific Tr would have a much better chance of success. Previously, collagen-specific Tr cells were induced by oral tolerance in anticipation that they would migrate to the rheumatoid joint, where they would be activated by endogenous type II collagen and inhibit joint inflammation via bystander suppression. Oral tolerance, however, had only modest beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis [87] , presumably because of an inadequate number of Tr cells generated. It is possible that collagen-specific Tr cells induced ex-vivo may have greater clinical effects than those induced by oral tolerance. In addition to autoimmune diseases, Tr cells generated ex vivo to block IL-4 production deserve consideration in the treatment of patients with severe steroid-dependent allergic asthma. Another possible use deserves comment. The host immune response against viral infections can result in severe tissue injury, as recently revealed by the SARS virus. Because adoptively transferred Tr cells traffic through the lungs, it is perhaps possible that Tr cells induced ex vivo can blunt the pathologic host response to the SARS virus by blocking T cell activation at that site.",
