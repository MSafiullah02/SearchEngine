The TCR of a CD8+ T cell discriminates peptides of usually eight to 10 amino acids that are embedded in major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC\u2010I) molecules (6). Crystal structural studies revealed that only a few TCR contact residues on the peptide presented by MHC molecules are required for activation 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, although a TCR can tolerate certain amino acid substitutions in the peptide sequence and still become activated. For example, amino acid substitutions for a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B8\u2010restricted Epstein \u2013 Barr virus (EBV) peptide at positions 1, 2, and 8 were tolerated, while substitutions at positions 4, 6, and 7 were crucial for cytotoxic T\u2010lymphocyte recognition (12). Thus, \u2018molecular mimicry\u2019, whereby a peptide ligand differing from the original ligand retains sites that are necessary for interaction with the TCR (13), is one of several paths to cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell responses. However, an alternative explanation for this flexibility in TCR binding may be explained by thermodynamic studies of TCR \u2013 peptide \u2013 MHC interactions 14, 15, 16, 17. The TCR undergoes conformational changes of the TCR complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for proper accommodation to cognate antigen, as seen with human T cells binding flu\u2010M158\u201066/HLA\u2010A2.1 and EBV\u2010EBNA3339\u2010347/HLA\u2010B8 epitopes (15, 16) and mouse T cells binding a cytochrome C epitope MCC88\u2010103/H2\u2010Ek (14). Wu et al. (17) have suggested an \u2018induced fit\u2019 model, where an \u03b1\u03b2\u2010TCR with low conformational complementarity to a peptide\u2010MHC first contacts the MHC molecule via the CDR1 and CDR2 loops, followed by readjustment of the flexible CDR3 loops to the peptide \u2013 MHC complex. This flexibility in the CDR3 molecule leads to an enhanced ability of a single TCR to accommodate structurally diverse peptides. It is possible that this kinetic flexibility in the TCR may also lead to different regions of the same TCR interacting with different sites on two separate ligands, termed as alternative recognition (18, 19). Another mechanism for T\u2010cell cross\u2010reactivity is the ability of T cells to express two different TCRs, due to incomplete allelic exclusion of the TCR\u03b1 chain (20). Mathematical calculations suggest that a single TCR should be able to react against 106 different nonamer peptides (21). Taken together, these mechanisms make cross\u2010reactivity very difficult to predict and a fairly common event.",

Cross\u2010reactivity could compensate for a situation with a limited TCR repertoire and still allow a normal immune response. For instance, mice deficient for the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) have impaired CDR3 diversification with a TCR repertoire which is only 5\u201310% of that calculated for wildtype mice (22), but upon lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or Sendai virus infection, these mice have a relatively normal immune response and recover from infection (23). These TdT\u2010deficient mice are reported to have T cells with a highly cross\u2010reactive profile when compared to wildtype mice (24), and thus, they may compensate for the less diverse TCR repertoire. Additionally, many TCR transgenic mice, which have limited TCR diversity, are capable of responding to many antigens and resisting viral infections (25, 26).",

Perhaps it is not surprising that cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell responses can be seen directed at evolutionarily conserved sites within virus groups, such as different strains of influenza virus 28, 29, 30 or dengue virus (31, 32), or conserved sites between different members of the same virus group, such as hantaviruses (33), arenaviruses (34), and flaviviruses (35). However, examples of cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell responses involving completely unrelated viruses such as LCMV and vaccinia virus (VV) (36), influenza virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (37), influenza virus and EBV (38), influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (39), and human papillomavirus and coronavirus (40), have now been shown. These cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell responses are more frequently observed once memory T\u2010cell populations have been generated, due the increased frequency and higher activation state of memory T cells 41, 42, 43. When cross\u2010reactive immune responses are present, they can alter T\u2010cell dynamics and have considerable consequences on the pathogenesis of infection and either inhibit or enhance the replication of a newly encountered heterologous virus 44, 45, 46, 47. They can also have a significant impact on allospecific T\u2010cell activity prior to and following transplantation (48, 49). In addition, autoimmunity has been associated with viral infections (50), and it is likely that an individual's history of virus infections and the unique composition of the cross\u2010reactive memory T\u2010cell pool may either initiate or reactivate T cells with auto\u2010immune potential.",

The CD8+ T\u2010cell memory pool created after a virus infection has a distinct hierarchy of epitope\u2010specific responses in a na\u00efve host. Some viral epitopes are dominant, stimulating high frequency T\u2010cell responses, while others are subdominant, stimulating weaker or barely detectable T\u2010cell responses (51). This immunodominance hierarchy is regulated by various parameters, including the efficiency of processing and presentation of the peptide, the affinity between peptide and the MHC\u2010I, the availability of T cells with TCRs that recognize the peptide\u2010MHC complex, and the competition between T cells for domains on the antigen\u2010presenting cell (APC) (52).",

Conservation of CDR3 amino acid motifs suggests that these sites are required for the TCR to bind to the MHC \u2013 ligand structure. These similarities in V\u03b2 usage and amino acid motifs, as well as conservation of immunodominance hierarchies, can be thought of as the \u2018public specificities\u2019 of epitope\u2010specific T\u2010cell responses that are similar between individuals.",

The TCR usage per epitope differs between individual hosts, even though there might be general similarities in preferred TCR V\u03b2 usage or specific CDR3 amino acid motifs (53, 56, 57, 58). Thus, the TCRs on the antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cell clones are unique to the individual, and these unique regions have been referred to as the \u2018private specificity\u2019 for that epitope\u2010specific response. This variation is probably a consequence of the random stochastic process of TCR rearrangement in the thymus, which results in variations in the na\u00efve peripheral TCR repertoire, and of the random stochastic process whereby a T\u2010cell encounters an APC presenting its cognate ligand (59). T\u2010cell clones that are stimulated early may dominate the response by interfering with the stimulation of other T cells (52).",

            "text": "When a memory CD8+ T\u2010cell has specificity for an epitope of an unrelated pathogen, the high frequency and activation state of memory cells gives it an advantage over na\u00efve T cells, which can lead to preferential expansion of the cross\u2010reactive CD8+ T\u2010cell population. This cross\u2010reactive expansion can alter the hierarchy of T\u2010cell responses; we saw this in sequential heterologous virus infections in mice with two distantly related arenaviruses, LCMV and Pichinde virus (PV) (34). These viruses encode epitopes in NP205 with six of eight amino acids in common. This epitope is normally subdominant for either virus in a na\u00efve host. However, due to a selective expansion of NP205\u2010specific cross\u2010reactive memory CD8+ T cells, this NP205\u2010specific T\u2010cell response became dominant when LCMV\u2010immune mice were infected with PV or when PV\u2010immune mice were infected with LCMV (34). These data support the concept that expansions of cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell populations substantially contribute to the immune hierarchies of T\u2010cell responses. This study may explain some of the variability in immunodominant hierarchies observed in human viral infections, where the host has been exposed to numerous infections throughout life. For instance, patients with identical haplotypes infected with HIV or HCV show high variability in their T\u2010cell immune hierarchies (60, 61). Interestingly, cross\u2010reactive CD8+ T\u2010cell responses to other pathogens have been documented for both of these viruses (37, 62).",

            "text": "Our studies with VV infection of LCMV\u2010immune mice showed that VV sometimes elicited the expansion of T cells with one LCMV epitope specificity but other times elicited the expansion of T cells with a different specificity. This outcome could be explained by the stochastic nature of clonal dominance and by the private specificities in antigen\u2010specific TCR repertoires in each immune host. Thus, the proportion of epitope\u2010specific memory T cells cross\u2010reactive with another antigen would differ from host to host. This variation is indeed what we have observed in LCMV\u2010immune hosts challenged with VV (36, 63). In our study to predict which LCMV\u2010encoded epitopes might be driving cross\u2010reactive responses to VV, substantial variability was noted when individual mice were tested. In 50% of mice, the VV infection stimulated strong expansion of T cells specific to the LCMV NP205\u2010212 epitope, in 23% of mice they were specific to either the glycoprotein (GP)33 or GP34 overlapping epitopes, and in 15% of mice specific to the GP118\u2010125 epitope (\nFig. 1A\n). Often there was expansion of T cells specific to only one LCMV epitope, but sometimes T cells specific to more than one epitope were expanded. The question was whether these variations in expansion represent random stochastic events in an LCMV\u2010immune mouse challenged with VV, where only a limited number of the cross\u2010reactive T cells actually engage antigen, or whether each mouse had a unique T\u2010cell repertoire in regards to its potential cross\u2010reactivity with VV. To address this point, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE)\u2010labeled splenocytes from different donor LCMV\u2010immune mice were adoptively transferred into three recipients, which were each then challenged with VV. The pattern of epitope\u2010specific T\u2010cell expansion was virtually identical among the recipients of a single donor but differed in recipients from different donors. This result showed that these variations in T\u2010cell responses were reflections of the private specificities of the individual immune host.",

This narrowing of the repertoire had different patterns between individuals, and adoptive transfer studies indicated that this variation was a reflection of the private specificities of the immune system that developed after the primary infection. Most studies, with few exceptions (65), have linked narrow TCR repertoires to poor viral clearance and an enhanced probability of selecting for epitope escape variants 66, 67, 68, 69. Thus, private specificities of memory TCR repertoires adds another level of complexity in understanding cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell responses and further explain the variability in disease outcome upon infection with the same pathogen (70).",

For example, LCMV\u2010immune mice control PV infection, presumably due to the cross\u2010reactivity of T cells specific for the subdominant NP205 epitope (34, 63). LCMV\u2010immune mice also manifest strong protective immunity against infections with the large DNA poxvirus VV compared to na\u00efve mice (44). In a respiratory model of infection, this heterologous immunity prevented mortality to an otherwise lethal dose of VV (45). Adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from LCMV\u2010immune mice were required to transfer protective immunity to na\u00efve mice challenged with PV or VV (44). Because of the tenuous balance between T\u2010cell immunodominance, protective immunity, and immunopathology, heterologous immunity is not always beneficial. Although immunity to LCMV protected against respiratory VV infection, it inhibited the clearance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (45, 47). Similarly, our work demonstrated that a history of influenza A infection protected against VV but inhibited clearance of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and LCMV (46) (\nTable 1\n).",

Since VV encodes over 200 proteins and perhaps thousands of potential epitopes, it is probably much more likely to encode an epitope that would activate some cells from an LCMV\u2010immune T\u2010cell population, whereas LCMV, which encodes only four proteins and a far more limited number of epitopes, may be less likely to encounter a VV\u2010immune T\u2010cell to stimulate. This finding could explain why so many large DNA viruses have evolved to encode gene products that interfere with MHC\u2010I antigen presentation (72). Other factors may also be involved. For instance, VV might be a better inducer of interleukin\u201012 (IL\u201012) than LCMV and could lead to enhanced IFN\u03b3 production by cross\u2010reactive T cells (45).",

In LCMV infection, T cells clear the virus but can also mediate a severe leptomeningitis (73, 74). The T\u2010cell\u2010mediated pathology during acute infection likely results from the inflammatory conditions induced by the presence of high numbers of T cells lysing infected tissues, producing pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which recruit other cells. Disease outcome is ultimately based on a fine balance between the number of memory T cells recruited to sites of viral replication, the efficiency and length of time these T cells are present, and amplifying pro\u2010inflammatory responses, before virus is cleared. The efficiency of the activated T cells in viral clearance is at least partially dependent on the avidity of the TCR interaction with its ligand. Studies with altered peptide ligands (APLs), which represent an in vitro model for cross\u2010reactive responses, show that high\u2010 and low\u2010potency ligands differ in the length of time the TCR interacts with MHC/ligand, i.e. TCR \u2018avidity\u2019, and modify the functional potential of individual clones (7, 79). These studies help explain why a lower avidity cross\u2010reactive response may not protect as well against a heterologous virus or why heterologous immunity may not be as effective at mediating protective immunity as homologous immunity. It is easy to imagine how an enhanced early activation of a lower avidity cross\u2010reactive clone might be inefficient at protection but could lead to different types of immunopathology.",

In a respiratory infection model, reduced mortality of LCMV\u2010immune mice infected with VV was accompanied by altered lung pathology (45). The lungs were infiltrated by LCMV\u2010specific T cells, which contributed to obstruction of bronchioles by fibrin and inflammatory cells (bronchiolitis obliterans). In humans, erythema nodosum and bronchiolitis obliterans are of unknown etiology but can be seen in some viral and bacterial infections and are also associated with autoimmune diseases 80, 81, 82. Erythema nodosum has been observed after vaccination for smallpox or hepatitis B. The development of bronchiolitis obliterans in lung allografts is associated with transplant rejection (82). Altered pathology also occurred in the influenza\u2010immune mice with augmented viral replication upon LCMV or MCMV infection. Instead of the usual mild mononuclear infiltrate observed in acute MCMV infection of na\u00efve mice, influenza\u2010immune mice infected with MCMV developed a severe consolidating mononuclear pneumonia with evidence of bronchiolization. During bronchiolization, alveolar epithelium is replaced by bronchiolar\u2010like cells, which is an indicator of lung repair (83).",

Perhaps the most recognized human examples of heterologous immunity come from dengue virus infections. Infection with a dengue virus serotype generated CD8+ T cells with a higher avidity to a second and presumably previously encountered dengue virus serotype, suggesting that cross\u2010reactive memory CD8+ T cells had preferentially expanded over T cells with greater avidity to the serotype causing infection (31, 85).

Other infections follow a similar pattern including mumps, chicken pox, polio, and measles. A subset of T cells directed against a major HLA\u2010A2.1\u2010restricted immunodominant EBV epitope, BMLF\u20101280, can cross\u2010react with the invariant HLA\u2010A2.1\u2010restricted influenza A virus epitope M158, even though they share only three of nine amino acids (38). Our recent studies have shown activation of these cross\u2010reactive T cells in some but not all acute mononucleosis patients, perhaps again reflecting private specificities in the host response (38). Due to the large size of its genome, EBV likely presents an extensive pool of potential CD8+ T\u2010cell epitopes that could activate other cross\u2010reactive memory CD8+ T cells of different specificities. In fact, we have been able to define a matrix of cross\u2010reactive EBV and influenza virus epitopes, analogous to the VV/LCMV a11r130 matrix, which centers on the EBV BMLF1280 epitope (unpublished data) (\nFig. 2\n).",

Interestingly, these cross\u2010reactive T cells, as in APL studies, behaved differently in their functional responses to each ligand. Some cross\u2010reactive cells bound both tetramers and produced tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), IFN\u03b3, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2 (MIP1\u03b2) to both ligands, some bound only one tetramer but produced TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, and MIP1\u03b2 to the alternate ligand, while some bound only one tetramer but were able to produce only MIP1\u03b2 to the alternate ligand. It would appear that how a cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell interacts with its alternative ligand is highly variable and that functional patterns of T\u2010cell cross\u2010reactivity are indeed heterogeneous. Hence, multiple techniques are required to detect T\u2010cell cross\u2010reactivity, including tetramer staining and different functional assays. A potentially important factor in TCR interaction with its ligand is TCR avidity. The interaction between a cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell and its alternative ligand could be too weak to stably bind tetramer but could be sufficient to induce a distinct hierarchy of cytokine production. This is analogous to the observation that influenza M1\u2010specific clones were unable to bind M1\u2010specific tetramers but produced IFN\u03b3 following M1 peptide stimulation (88).",

Studies examining cross\u2010reactivity between LCMV\u2010specific CD8+ T cells and alloantigens showed that this cross\u2010reactivity was broad\u2010based, as a portion of T cells specific for each of the four LCMV epitopes examined (GP33, NP205, GP276, and NP396) cross\u2010reacted with H2d antigens, as determined by the production of IFN\u03b3 (48).

This distinctive nature of cross\u2010reactivity was clearly evident between LCMV\u2010specific T cells and H2k antigens, which was still broad\u2010based but was also more selective, as two of the four LCMV\u2010epitopes examined (GP33 and NP205) were cross\u2010reactive.

This assay allows T\u2010cell\u2010mediated rejection of CFSE\u2010labeled allogeneic splenocytes to be examined in vivo within 20 h after transfer. The in vivo cytotoxicity assay will also detect natural killer (NK) cell\u2010mediated rejection of allogeneic splenocytes, and to specifically examine T\u2010cell\u2010dependent mechanisms, NK cells need to be depleted before transfer of the target splenocytes (117). Infection of B6 mice with either LCMV or PV induced a CD8+ T\u2010cell\u2010dependent mechanism for the rejection of implanted allogeneic splenocytes that was first detectable one day after infection and reached peak levels by day three postinfection (116). This virus\u2010induced CD8+ T\u2010cell\u2010dependent rejection was surprising, in that it occurred at an early time point after infection, when NK cell functions are peaking.

Undoubtedly, there may be many mechanisms for this loss in cell number, but a common mediator may be type 1 IFN, which is induced at high levels in the early stages of infections in direct response to viral replication. A substantial loss in CD8+ and CD4+ T\u2010cell number during the first five days of LCMV infection parallels the levels of type 1 IFN production, does not occur in type 1 IFN receptor knockout mice (159), is blocked by antibody to type 1 IFN (167), and is mimicked by IFN\u2010inducing TLR agonists, such as poly(I:C) (159). The cells suffering the highest levels of apoptosis are CD44hi CD8+ T cells. These cells activate caspases and express phosphatidyl serine on their membranes, which interacts with annexin V (158, 159). The apoptotic loss of either memory or, to a lesser extent, na\u00efve CD8+ T cells occurs prior to cell division, as shown by bromodeoxyuridine uptake studies in vivo (159) or by implanting CSFE\u2010labeled T cells into mice and looking for loss of CSFE staining as an indicator of cell division versus apoptosis (168). This early apoptosis of T cells is not inhibited by stimulation of the T cells with their ligand. Injection of mice with enough LCMV epitope GP33\u201043 to cause activation of GP33\u2010specific transgenic or memory CD8+ T cells in vivo in regards to up\u2010regulation of CD69 did not inhibit LCMV\u2010 or poly(I:C)\u2010induced apoptosis of the cells. This finding is of interest, because some models of T\u2010cell activation have indicated that exposure of T cells to ligand, especially in the context of proper costimulation, causes an upregulation of antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl\u2010XL to protect the dividing T cells from apoptosis (169). Our computer modeling, however, indicates that without the apoptosis of memory T cells at the early stages of infection, cross\u2010reactive T cells might dominate the response to any infection (168, 170). By selectively reducing the frequency of memory cells at the beginning of an immune response, there may be a more highly diverse T\u2010cell response to a new pathogen, and this high diversity may be beneficial for pathogen control.",

It has a major effect on the differentiation of antigen\u2010presenting dendritic cells, acting, somewhat surprisingly, through a signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2)\u2010dependent pathway (171). Recent work on the \u2018growth inhibitory\u2019 function of type 1 IFN, which might be linked to its pro\u2010apoptotic properties, has implicated the importance of the STAT1 signaling pathway (172). Of interest is that CD8+ T cells downregulate STAT1 after activation and then become resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of IFN. Type 1 IFN can also induce the division of memory T cells through its ability to induce IL\u201015 (173). Most memory T cells express receptors for IL\u201015, which is also a mediator of homeostatic division (139, 140). Together, it seems that type 1 IFN first causes apoptosis of memory T cells and a generalized lymphopenic state. Then IL\u201015 stimulates them to divide until the lymphopenic state is corrected. They do not \u2018overshoot\u2019 in number, unless antigen is there to drive a new immune response.",

There has been controversy concerning whether staining with annexin V really means impending apoptosis or whether it might just be a marker for T\u2010cell activation. Our studies showed that the fate of LCMV\u2010specific annexin V+ CD8+ T cells, when introduced into culture in vitro, was to fragment their DNA and complete the apoptotic processes. When transferred into mice in vivo, the annexin V+ cell populations gradually decreased in number and failed to mediate a recall response, whereas similarly transferred annexin V\u2013 cells could mediate a recall response (175). Some correlations were made between cells that were annexin V\u2013 and expression of receptors for IL\u20107 (175). IL\u20107R is expressed on cells bearing high concentrations of antiapoptotic markers such as Bcl\u20102, and these are precursors for fully functional memory cells (176). We thus feel that annexin V is indeed a harbinger of apoptosis, though the apoptosis does not necessarily happen immediately.",

It is commonly stated that 95% of the activated T cells die by apoptosis, but that number is based on examining T\u2010cell frequencies in lymphoid tissue. One study in the influenza system indicated that there was a much smaller reduction when all the cells in the body were added up (165). A feature of LCMV\u2010specific CD8+ cells in the periphery, meaning lung, visceral fat, or peritoneal cavity, is that they have a different apoptotic phenotype than those present in the spleen and lymph nodes at the same time. These peripheral T cells react less with annexin V, express more IL\u20107R, stain less with antibodies to Fas or FasL, and are relatively resistant to ligand\u2010triggered AICD (54, 175). In the LCMV system, part of the resistance of peritoneal cells to AICD was linked to the presence of transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (54). In the lung of influenza\u2010infected mice, the resistance to apoptosis was linked to collagen in the lung signaling through \u03b11\u03b21 integrin expressed on the T cells (177). Signaling through certain integrins and adhesion molecules has long been known to render T cells resistant to apoptosis (178), and changes in the tissue environment of T cells may well alter their apoptotic properties. The significance of this finding may relate to the fact that effector memory T cells may linger in peripheral tissue long after clearance of a virus, providing a potential fast acting line of defense to pathogens.",

            "text": "An intriguing aspect about the apoptosis of T cells is that there are epitope\u2010specific preferences regarding the degree of apoptosis (175). This can easily be seen in the LCMV infection of C57BL/6 mice, where T cells specific for the Db\u2010restricted NP396\u2010404 epitope express higher annexin V reactivity, higher Fas, lower IL\u20107R (175), and higher mitochondrial membrane potential (179) than do T cells specific for the Db\u2010restricted GP33\u201041 epitope. This finding might be explained by the fact that the T cells specific to this epitope may be triggered more often than by the GP33 epitope, as the LCMV NP is expressed at much higher levels than the GP during the LCMV infection of cells. However, VV recombinants expressing NP versus G\u2010proteins under similar promoters stimulate T cells with the same apoptotic properties (175). Nevertheless, the NP396 epitope is a very high affinity binder to H2Db and may still be expressed better than GP33. What is most intriguing, however, is that this differential in apoptosis between NP396 and GP33 is also seen on secondary immunizations, where there would be less antigen presented, and in the resting immune state, where there is no antigen at all. The apoptotic levels are lower in the resting immune state, but the apoptotic differential between NP396\u2010specific versus GP33\u2010specific T cells remains. It seems that the apoptotic properties of epitope\u2010specific T cells are an intrinsic property of the epitope, presumably learned during the early phases of infection and imprinted permanently in those T cells. One might expect that the ratio of NP396\u2010 to GP33\u2010specific T cells should change in the resting memory state, and indeed there is a moderate shift to GP33 dominance over time within this otherwise moderately stable memory population (175).",

Very little information is available concerning the stability of CD8+ T\u2010cell memory in humans, because most studies are done with persistent virus infections, such as HIV, EBV, CMV, and HCV, or with repeatedly encountered pathogens like influenza virus. Recent studies of individuals immunized with VV, the small pox vaccine, have indicated relatively stable memory populations over several decades, though the memory frequencies did decline over 10\u2010fold (155). It will be necessary to determine whether the VV\u2010specific T\u2010cell repertoires remain stable over time to assess how stable this memory is. That is because our studies in the mouse have suggested that VV may be highly cross\u2010reactive with other viruses, inviting the possibility that some of the VV\u2010specific T cells may be maintained through cross\u2010reactivity (36, 71)(\nFig. 3\n).",

            "text": "We have proposed two models to explain the loss of pre\u2010existing memory occurring as a consequence of a heterologous viral infection: the Active Attrition Model, whereby something directly kills off the memory cells, and the Passive Attrition Model, where the newly formed memory cells compete with the previously formed memory cells for protective niches in the spleen and lymph nodes as the immune response contracts (27, 71, 170). Although both these mechanisms might influence the survival of memory, our data support the active model, occurring during the early cytokine\u2010induced lymphopenia phase of infection (156). By quantifying pre\u2010existing antigen\u2010specific CD8+ memory cells and following their frequencies through the course of infection, it is clear that their numbers go down very early during the virus\u2010induced lymphopenia and that their recovery is rather modest. There may still be some accommodation issues in competing for protective niches later in infection, but its relative importance seems less than the active attrition in these models of infection. Because virus\u2010induced lymphopenia is a commonly described event occurring during many human infections, including influenza, West Nile, Ebola, HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona, and even human LCMV (166, 168), we suspect that this will be a factor driving attrition in memory in humans. There has been little analysis of the effects of human virus\u2010induced lymphopenia on CD8+ memory to other antigens, though it is known that patients receiving IFN therapy at least initially have a loss in memory phenotype CD8+ T cells (180). These types of issues are now being examined in controlled vaccination studies, but the vaccines may not drive the level of lymphopenia necessary to cause a loss in memory. Otherwise, the vaccinees would get sick. This issue may be best addressed in those many volunteers who get bad reactions to the small pox vaccine!",

Our studies have shown that memory T cells specific to heterologous viruses are greatly deleted after the initiation of infection with a high dose of LCMV clone 13, which will cause a persistent infection, and those T cells do not rebound in frequency (156). In addition, when CSFE\u2010labeled memory T cells are transferred into mice persistently infected with the LCMV clone 13, a few attempt modest levels of homeostatic division, but most are rapidly eliminated. If similar mechanisms occur in humans, it would suggest that persistent infections such as HIV or HCV should vigorously delete memory to everything else that does not receive re\u2010stimulation by its own antigen or by cross\u2010reactive antigen. During persistent human infections, could residual memory T cells specific to nonpersistent antigens be cross\u2010reactive with the pathogen driving the infection?",

This ineffectiveness is for two reasons, the first being that they have to compete with antigen\u2010specific T cells responding to the ongoing infection. Antigen\u2010driven proliferation at three to four divisions per day occurs at a much higher rate than homeostatic division (43, 182), and the pre\u2010existing memory cells cannot compete. The second factor is that bona fide memory cells are not very effective at homeostatic proliferation in the first place, even in the absence of an infection (183). When CSFE\u2010labeled LCMV\u2010immune splenocytes were transferred into T\u2010cell\u2010deficient mice or mice rendered lymphopenic by irradiation or poly(I:C) inoculation, the proportion of LCMV\u2010specific T cells in the reconstituting population of cells became, in comparison with its starting frequency, substantially reduced as the cells proliferated to fill up the lymphopenic environment. Thus, the memory cells compete poorly with the HP cells that respond to self\u2010antigens or microbial flora (131, 183, 184). We predict that conditions in humans that cause lymphopenia other than infections, such as irradiation or immunosuppressive drug treatment, should induce a memory cell loss, which needs to be tested.",

With each new infection, memory T cells must compete for limited space. This competition is at least partially accomplished by the preferential loss of prior memory populations by active cytokine\u2010dependent mechanisms. Also, memory T cells specific to previously encountered pathogens but also cross\u2010reactive with the newly encountered pathogen are preferentially maintained or expanded, such that the T\u2010cell repertoire specific to the previous pathogen becomes permanently altered (\nFig. 3\n). These activated cross\u2010reactive memory T cells play a role in heterologous immunity by modulating the T\u2010cell immune hierarchy and the private specificity of individual antigen\u2010specific TCR repertoires, leading to an alteration in the balance between protective immunity and immunopathology. Virus\u2010specific T\u2010cell responses cross\u2010reactive with allo\u2010antigens can also alter the memory allospecific T\u2010cell pool and influence graft rejection and tolerance induction. Thus, getting the wrong infection in a host with a particular MHC and at the wrong time in a sequence of other infections might have significant consequences for the host. To understand the fine balance memory T cells can play in the induction of protective immunity versus pathology, we need to learn more about the consequences of heterologous immunity and cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell responses.",
