In this context, the common ancestor of a set of sequences is so remote in time that the difference in sampling times provides little or no additional statistical information. The recent advent of inexpensive and rapid genome sequencing now makes it possible to monitor evolution on a time scale concomitant with the rate of such change (Drummond et al., 2003). In the important case of RNA virus evolution, samples made days or weeks apart may well have evolved substantial genomic differences. In this situation, sampling time provides information on the rate of the nucleotide substitution and, consequently, the phylogenetic relationships among taxa.",

Generally, the MCA provides an explicit functional or statistical relationship between time and the frequency of nucleotide alterations (Felsenstein, 2004). Most commonly the association is assumed to be constant, as it is in Tree and Rate Estimation By Local Evalutation (TREBLE). Recently several programs including BEAST [V1.3, (Drummond et al., 2002) and r8s (Sanderson, 2003)] have implemented capacities to estimate the rate of nucleotide substitution under a relaxed molecular clock model via the assumption of a prior distribution of rates along branches. In either its relaxed or strict formulation, the MCA induces a zero-th order approximation of the dynamic evolutionary process, taking the rate or rate process to be constant over the tree.",

Using triplets of sequences, TREBLE calculates the appropriate topology for the set. As the sampling times are known, the topology enforces specific ratios between the pairwise distances among the sequences that are then used to calculate the rate of nucleotide substitution for that set. Using this solution, the probability of a misspecified topology is calculated and only those triplets above a given threshold are included for further calculation. A variance weighting is then used to integrate these local calculations into a global estimate of the rate of substitution. Finally, a bootstrap is applied to produce confidence intervals on the estimate. The computational efficiency of the algorithm results from the use of rate estimates derived from heterochronous triplets of sequences and the corresponding absence of other costly parameter estimations.",

The phylogenetic trees produced are significantly improved over the other distance matrix method (PEBBLE) but still substantially less accurate than the Bayesian algorithm (BEAST). In terms of computational time, TREBLE represents a substantial improvement of at least three orders of magnitude over the next fastest method. Applied to real data sets of dated Dengue, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza A gene sequences, TREBLE provides estimates for the rate of nucleotide substitution nearly identical with those provided by other methods and estimates of the time of most recent common ancestors consistent with observation.",

This matrix together with any pair of sequences (si, sj) allows an estimate of the number of substitutions between them, K^ij, via the equations developed by Li and Gu (1995).

For an evolutionary situation modeled by a Markov process of nucleotide substitution, necessarily p \u2265 0. Further, every pair of sequences, si and sj, is assumed to have a most recent common ancestor (MRCA). The MRCA for a set of sequences is also referred to as the root. The time when the sequences si and sj diverged from their MRCA is labeled \u03c4ij. If the sequences are sampled at ti and tj, respectively, then necessarily \u03c4ij \u2264 ti and \u03c4ij \u2264 tj. These relationships are diagrammed in Figure 1a. Here the MCA is taken to mean that p is constant over a given set of sequences. This statement of the MCA is common, although it is more restrictive than some recent work (Sanderson, 2003; Drummond et al., 2003, 2006). Applied to a pair of sequences, this formulation enforces a geometric relationship between the number of base pair substitutions per site between two sequences and the total amount of time of their independent evolution. This is neatly summarized in the equation:\n(1)K^ij=pij(ti+tj\u22122\u03c4ij)+\u03b5ij,\nwhere \u03b5ij is the error associated with the estimate K^ij. For most of the equations below this value is treated as negligible. pij is subscripted by the sequence numbers to indicate that the MCA only applies to the pair (si, sj).",

The first sort of error is inherent to the process under observation. Alignment uncertainty is left untreated for the purposes of this paper. TREBLE attempts to increase the accuracy of the estimates by limiting the remaining forms of error. Variance in the estimates is minimized by a weighting scheme similar to iterative reweighted least squares (Fox, 1997).

BEAST gave the estimated rate as 8.14 \u00d7 10\u22126 s/s/year with a 95% credible interval from 1.34 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.54 \u00d7 10\u22125 s/s/year. This implies divergence from the MRCA on about October 8, 2002 with a 95% CI from April 28, 2002 to January 21, 2003. Although the calculations of the Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium provided the rate of synonymous s/s/year and hence are not commensurate with the results from TREBLE or BEAST, the inferred MRCA is similar at mid-November 2002 with a 95% CI from early June, 2002, to late December, 2002. The phylogenetic tree constructed by the Consortium agrees nearly identically with that of TREBLE (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemology Consortium, 2004).",
