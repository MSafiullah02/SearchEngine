Although the pandemic has been contained, concerns over its recurrence remain. It is essential to identify specific diagnostic agents and antiviral vaccine candidates to fight this highly contagious disease. Methods: We generated 14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein and used these to thoroughly map the N protein antigenic determinants. We identified the immunodominant antigenic sites responsible for the antibodies in sera from SARS patients and antisera from small animals and differentiated the linear from the conformational antibody-combining sites comprising the natural epitopes by use of yeast surface display. Results: We identified 5 conformational and 3 linear epitopes within the entire N protein; 3 conformational and 3 linear epitopes were immunodominant. The antibody responses to the N protein fragments in mammalian sera revealed that 3 regions of the N protein are strong antigenic domains. We expanded the specificity of the N protein epitope and identified 4 novel confor-mational epitopes (amino acids 1-69, 68 -213, 212-341, and 337-422).

Primary genomic structural analysis has revealed that the SARS-CoV N protein contains a highly conserved motif located in the region of amino acids 111-118 (FYYLGTGP) (50 ) and a unique lysine-rich region around amino acids 362-381 (KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ) (51 ) , findings suggesting that the protein acts as a nuclear localization signal (Fig.  1D ). The mAb-specific epitopes located in the regions covering amino acids 68 -213 and 337-422 on the N protein suggest that mAbs M1, M4, M5, M6, M7, M10, and M11 could serve as biochemical markers to analyze the functional roles of these regions in SARS-CoV pathogenesis in other experimental systems. Although the Nterminal (amino acids 45-181) structure of the SARS-CoV N protein has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (52 ) and this region has been promoted as the putative RNA-binding domain (53 ) , the structure of the full-length N protein has not yet been determined. We found that 7 of 14 mAbs (M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, and M9) reacted only with the yeastdisplayed full-length N protein (amino acids 1-422) and the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1-213), but not with the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 214 -422), which specifically reacted with the other mAbs (M2, M8, M10, M11, M12, M13, and M14). This unexpected finding led us to speculate that the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 214 -422) is buried within the entire N protein and provides a clue to further explore the native structure of the N protein.

All 14 mAbs showed a positive signal to Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV but no reactivity with MRC-5 cells infected with CoV 229E or BS-C-1 cells infected with CoV OC43.The IFA results indicate that the SARS-CoV N-proteinspecific mAbs generated in this study did not cross-react with other human coronavirus strains.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "c The purified recombinant N proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, blotted with purified mAbs, and visualized with aminoethyl carbazole chromogen: \u03ea, no reactivity; \u03e9W, weak positive signal; \u03e9M, medium positive signal; \u03e9S, strong positive signal. d The indirect immunofluorescence staining was assessed in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV, MRC-5 cells infected with human CoV 229E, and BS-C-1 cells infected with human CoV OC43: \u03ea, negative result; \u03e9, positive signal; /, not tested. amino acids 1-213), NND13 (amino acids 1-120), and NT1 (amino acids 1-69), but not with NT2 (amino acids 68 -120) or NT3 (amino acids 119 -213).
