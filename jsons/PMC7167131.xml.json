            "text": "One of the greatest successes of modern veterinary science has been the control of infectious disease through the development and implementation of vaccination programmes. This success is typified by the rapid decline in the prevalence of key canine infectious diseases (caused by canine distemper virus [CDV], canine adenovirus [CAV] and canine parvovirus [CPV]) following the introduction of efficacious modified live virus vaccines. Similar effects relate to the introduction of feline vaccines, with clear reduction in mortality caused by feline parvovirus (FPV; feline panleukopenia) and morbidity caused by feline calicivirus (FCV) and herpesvirus (FHV) infections. However, the success of these vaccines cannot be a cause for complacency, and indeed vaccine\u2010related issues have featured high on the agenda of the veterinary profession over the past decade. There are many challenges remaining in small animal vaccinology, and in 2006 the WSAVA Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) was convened with the specific remit of taking a global perspective on issues surrounding the practice of vaccination of dogs and cats. The VGG has met formally on three occasions and corresponded electronically between these meetings, and this document is the result of these deliberations. The VGG guidelines are built on those developed by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccine Task Force and the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) Feline Vaccine Advisory Panel. Based upon a consensus among experts, these recommendations reflect a combination of opinion, experience, and scientific data, published and unpublished. The present vaccination guidelines are intended for the general veterinary practice and the shelter environment; they do not represent a standard of care or set of legal parameters. They have been drafted with the objective of educating and informing the profession and to recommend rational vaccine use for individual pets and dog/cat populations.",

The VGG considers that a core vaccine is one that all puppies throughout the world must receive in order to provide protection against infectious diseases of global significance. The VGG recognises that particular countries will identify additional vaccines that they consider core. A particular example of a vaccine that may be considered core in only some countries is that against rabies virus. In a geographical area in which this infection is endemic all dogs should be routinely vaccinated for the protection of both the pet and human populations. In some countries, mandatory rabies vaccination is a legal requirement, and is generally also required for international pet travel. Non\u2010core vaccines are those that are licensed for the dog and whose use is determined on the basis of the animal\u2019s geographical and lifestyle exposure and an assessment of risk\u2010benefit ratios. Not recommended vaccines are those for which there is little scientific justification for their use.",

In general, passive immunity will have waned by 8 to 12 weeks of age to a level that allows active immunisation. Pups with poor MDA may be vulnerable (and capable of responding to vaccination) at an earlier age, while others may possess MDA at such high titres that they are incapable of responding to vaccination until \u226512 weeks of age. No single primary vaccination policy will therefore cover all possible situations. The recommendation of the VGG is for initial vaccination at 8 to 9 weeks of age followed by a second vaccination 3 to 4 weeks later, and a third vaccination given between 14 to 16 weeks of age. By contrast, at present many vaccine data sheets recommend an initial course of two injections. Some products are also licensed with a \u201810 week finish\u2019 designed such that the second of two vaccinations is given at 10 weeks of age. The rationale behind this protocol is to permit \u2018early socialisation\u2019 of pups. The VGG recognises that this is of great benefit to the behavioural development of dogs. Where such protocols are adopted, great caution should still be maintained by the owner \u2013 allowing restricted exposure of the pup to controlled areas and only to other pups that are healthy and fully vaccinated.",

Therefore, when antibody is absent (irrespective of the serological test used) the dog should be revaccinated unless there is a medical basis for not so doing. Antibody determinations to other vaccine components are of limited value because of the short time period these antibodies persist (e.g., Leptospira products) or the lack of correlation between serum antibody and protection (e.g. canine parainfluenza).

Emphasis should be placed on a detailed vaccination interview, a comprehensive physical examination by the veterinarian, and individualised patient care. The importance of dental care, proper nutrition, appropriate diagnostic testing and the control of parasites and of zoonotic diseases should also be addressed during evaluation of each pet.
