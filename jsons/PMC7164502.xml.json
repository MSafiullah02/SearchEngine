At the\nheart of the muscle \u201cengine\u201d are the myosin motors or crossbridges\nwhich are able to harness energy derived from adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis to\ndrive their cyclic interactions with actin filaments leading to muscle contraction.\nMorphologically, the myosin molecules of striated and smooth muscle are\nindistinguishable. After they are activated, myosin crossbridges of smooth muscle\ninteract with actin filaments in a qualitatively similar manner as their\ncounterparts do in striated muscle [1,2]. The hyperbolic function which\ncharacterizes the force\u2013velocity relationship in striated muscle [3] also describes the same relationship very\nwell in smooth muscle [4\u20136]. This is taken as evidence suggesting that\nthe molecular mechanism of the actomyosin interaction seen in striated muscle is\nalso operative in smooth muscle.",

Unlike the bipolar filaments found in striated muscle [7], myosin filaments in smooth muscle are\nlikely side-polar [8\u201310]. This difference in the filament\nstructure means that the contractile-unit structure in smooth muscle should be\ndifferent from that of a striated muscle sarcomere, as envisioned by Craig and\nMegerman [8] and Hodgkinson et al. [11]; that is, a side-polar filament with\ncrossbridges having the same polarity along the entire length of one side of the\nfilament and opposite polarity on the other side and when interacting with actin\nfilaments of matching polarities, pulling the actin filaments to slide in opposite\ndirections (Fig. 1). The actin filaments (with\na myosin filament sandwiched in between) are assumed to attach to dense bodies\n(equivalent to the Z-disks in striated muscle), thus forming a functional\ncontractile unit, at least in theory. In this review, functional and structural data\nfrom airway smooth muscle are analyzed with the help of mathematical models to test\nthe validity of the side-polar contractile unit model. Mathematical models are also\nused to relate changes in force\u2013velocity properties to changes in the\nkinetics of actomyosin crossbridge cycle and to explain why myosin filaments in\nsmooth muscle, unlike those in striated muscle, do not have the same length.",

At intermediate range of loads where a muscle is operating at or near\nits maximal power and perhaps where the loads are most physiologically relevant, the\nHill equation and the Huxley model are the same in terms of their mathematical\nexpression and the associated insights into the molecular mechanisms. The Hill\nequation is therefore no longer just an empirical tool but contains mechanistic\ninformation of the crossbridge cycle. For example, because K is\nrelated to the curvature of a force\u2013velocity curve [14], an increase in K will decrease the\ncurvature and thus increase the relative power output of the muscle. Because\nK = fAPP/k\n(Eq. (12)), we now know that an\nincrease in muscle power can result from an increase in the apparent attachment rate\n(fAPP) and/or a decrease in k, or\nin other words, a decrease in the dependence of the apparent detachment rate\n(gAPP) on shortening velocity.",

Although there is\nanecdotal evidence supporting such a model [21,22], structural and\nfunctional details of the model have yet to be substantiated. The distinct features\nin the length\u2013force relationship of striated muscle (shown in gray in Fig.\n4) stem directly from physical limitations\nassociated with the unique sarcomeric structure of the muscle [23]; in other words, the sarcomeric structure determines the\nlength\u2013force relationship. The contractile-unit model for smooth muscle (Fig.\n3(a)) predicts that the\nascending limb of the length\u2013force curve should be a straight line without a\nkink (Fig. 3b), unlike that of striated muscle\n(Fig. 4, gray lines) where a kink in the\nascending portion of the curve is evident due to the encounter of the myosin\nfilament with the Z-disk of the sarcomere during excessive shortening. Without a\nZ-disk in the smooth muscle contractile unit which contains dense bodies instead,\nsuch a kink is not expected in the length\u2013force relationship of smooth\nmuscle. Herrera et al. [22] tested the\nmodel (Fig. 3(a)) by measuring\nthe lengths of airway smooth muscle at different isotonic loads while minimizing\nlength adaptation during the measurement and confirmed that indeed, the ascending\nlimb of the length\u2013force curve in the muscle was a straight line (solid line\nand open circles, Fig. 4). The obvious lack of\na kink in the ascending limb of the length\u2013force curve indicates that the\nsarcomeric structure seen in striated muscle is unlikely to be present in smooth\nmuscle; and furthermore, the data (Fig. 4) are\nconsistent with the model shown in Fig. 3(a).",

This means that\nthe load shared by each crossbridge will increase as contraction proceeds even if\nthe muscle is shortening against a constant load.

At the relatively high\nphysiological ionic strength of 200 mM, there is virtually no filament\nformation of smooth muscle myosin in vitro [28]. An intriguing question is why myosin filaments exist in smooth\nmuscle cells. The answer could lie in the fact that myosin filament formation in\nsmooth muscle occurs within the actin filament lattices, which are known to\nfacilitate assembly of myosin filaments [29,30]. Many of the\nactin-filament-associated proteins such as caldesmon are also known to facilitate\nmyosin filament assembly [31] perhaps due\nto their affinity to myosin molecules (see a review by Seow [32]). Recruitment of myosin molecules into the relatively\nrestricted space of an actin filament lattice could be the catalytic step leading to\nmyosin filament formation at physiological ionic strength. Within the lattice myosin\nmolecules are not likely to form a long and unbroken filament as that shown in Fig.\n3(a) but likely are in the\nform of filament segments lined up end-to-end as that shown in Fig. 6(b), with a length distribution\ngoverned by an exponential decay function (Fig. 6(a)). Interestingly, if we only allow myosin\npolymerization and depolymerization to occur at the ends of a filament in the\nmodeling, then a Gaussian distribution of the filament lengths appears [26]. The fact that exponential distribution\nis observed indicates that spontaneous fragmentation of a filament is not restricted\nto the two ends of the filament.",
