The patient was an alcoholic with a past medical history of chronic bronchitis and coronary heart disease. The illness began with flu-like symptoms, including a high fever (38.3 \u00b0C), cough with yellow-white phlegm and feeling fatigued on 30 January 2014. Because the detection of the influenza A virus universal antigen was negative on the throat-swab by means of the immune colloidal gold technique and the radiologic findings revealed bronchitis, the patient was treated with anti-infective therapy by an intravenous injection of moxifloxacin. However, that treatment did not take effect, and the symptoms gradually worsened.",

The H7N9 viral RNA was positive in the oropharynx swab confirmed by the real-time RT-PCR method according to the protocol of the Chinese CDC10. The patient was transferred into the intensive care unit (ICU) of Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University. The case was diagnosed as a laboratory-confirmed case of influenza A (H7N9) infection with severe pneumonia combined with the complications of acute respiratory failure, septic shock, stress ulcer and acute renal failure. Antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) with combination of antibiotics (Sulperazon), a gastric acid secretion inhibitor (omeprazole), mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement, supportive nutrition therapy and symptomatic treatment were given. On 12 February 2014, the H7N9 viral nucleic acid was negative when detecting the tracheal aspirate specimens by real-time RT-PCR. On 12 March 2014, the infection symptoms and the respiratory function improved, and the circulation situation tended to be stable. After approximately four months of treatment, the patient recovered and was discharged from hospital on 6 June 2014 (Table 1).",

Genetic alignments showed that the HA, NA, PB1, PA, NP and NS genes possessed the highest genetic similarities (99.33\u201399.74%) with other H7N9 virus genes. However, the PB2 and M genes possessed the highest nucleotide similarities (99.39% and 98.73%, respectively) with H9N2 isolates (Table 2).

The phylogenies of the PB2 and M genes documented that BJ02 and BJ01 fell into different clades, and this finding implied that different evolutionary pathways might behind these two viruses (Fig. 1C,D). According to the genotypic assignment in the previous study3, the PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS genes of BJ02 were assigned to clades 2, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 2 and 1, respectively, in the phylogenetic trees, and these results suggest that BJ02 should be designated as Genotype 2.9 (G2.9). BJ01 was designated as Genotype 1.5 (G1.5) because its internal genes grouped into clades 1.4, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1 and 1 (Figs 1C,D and 2). This case was the first human infection caused by the G2.9 virus. Notably, the G2.9 virus was previously isolated from poultry in the Jiangsu province in 2013 (A/chicken/Jiangsu/SC537/2013(H7N9), SC537). BJ02 and SC537 shared high genetic similarities (Table 2). However, the PB2 and M genes of BJ02 clustered together with other avian-source H9N2 viruses (Fig. 1C,D). All of these findings suggested that this novel genotype virus should emerge and evolve in poultry prior to transmission to humans.",

To date, only one G1.5 and one G2.9 virus from humans have been isolated; and the other G2.9 strain (SC537) was first isolated from chickens. Although high homology is shared between BJ02 and SC537 (Table 2), the PB2 and M genes of the BJ02 virus clustered with other avian-source H9N2 or H7N9 viruses (Fig. 1C,D). These data indicate that BJ02 likely evolved from a novel genotype found in chickens (SC537) that then reassorted with other H9 or H7 virus in birds before being transmitted to humans. This finding suggested that the reassortment with other subtype viruses in avians is still the major evolutionary path of the H7N9 virus; then, sensitive people would be infected after exposure to the mutated viruses. Hence, diverse H7N9 genotypes or reassortants were consecutively isolated in humans. To standardize or close the live poultry trade would be the most efficient way to prevent and control the human-avian influenza virus infection disease.",

This finding suggested that diverse genotype viruses should possess heterogenic host-specific preference and pathogenicity for humans.

The underlying mechanisms need to be further clarified.",

            "text": "In general, viral and host factors contribute to disease severity and outcomes. A previous multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of coexisting medical conditions (such as chronic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were the only independent risk factors for severe illness with H7N9 infection1. Recent studies found that the presence of host genetic factors might be closely related to H7N9 influenza disease susceptibility and/or severity2122. The IFN-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) C/C genotype was reported to be associated with severe clinical outcomes, as reflected by a higher viral load, more rapid progression to ARDS, higher cytokine/chemokine levels, and an increased mortality rate after H7N9 infection22. Recently, increasing data showed that elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (especially IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b2, IP-10, MIF, SCF, MCP-1, and HGF) in the infected lung and plasma (hypercytokinaemia) are highly positively linked to disease severity in H7N9 infected patients23242526. Cytokine production is closely related to the severity of host lesions due to influenza virus infection272829. Proper cytokine expression is necessary for disease recovery, defending against virus infection, and recruiting inflammatory cells to the sites of infection through a delicate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators30. However, cytokine over-expression breaks the immunologic balance, which causes systemic inflammation, acute organ dysfunction and even death113132. H7N9-infected patients present the manifestations of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and hypercytokinaemia1012, which also were observed in the present case. In the present study, the H7N9 patient displayed the highest levels of IP-10, IL-6, IL-12p40 and MCP-1 secretion in the serum obtained during the acute phase of the disease (7 d.a.o.). Notably, the elevation of the chemokine IP-10 was the most robust among all of the detected cytokines and chemokines. Because IP-10 is a critical player in the induction of lung injury, its upregulation in H7N9 infection might be positively linked to disease severity, and this molecule could be a sensitive outcome predictor24. Although the case number was limited in our study to compare the serum cytokine levels between H7N9 and H1N1 infected patients, a similar profile of mediator secretion patterns in H7N9 and H1N1 infected patients has been seen by other groups with more influenza A patients124. Hence, the higher level of cytokine secretion might explain the more severe syndromes caused by H7N9 virus infection than by the contemporaneous H1N1 virus. It should be mentioned that there are also some different changes between our study and other studies in the cytokines for the H7N9 infections1233343536. This finding might be related to the individual differences of host immune responses and the virus pathogenic characteristics, which should be further determined with more sample cases in the future.",
