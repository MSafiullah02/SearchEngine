            "text": "Exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP) is a rare condition resulting from aspiration or inhalation of oil-based substances, with both acute and chronic forms. Chronic ELP results from long-term, recurrent inhalation exposure to oil, while acute ELP is secondary to accidental aspiration of a large quantity of lipid material over a short period of time [1, 2]. The majority of patients with acute ELP recover without long-term morbidity. However, in a few instances, it may result in severe inflammatory response, acute respiratory failure, chronic alveolar and interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis, causing residual damage to the lungs [3\u20135]. The authors retrospectively identified 33 pediatric cases of acute ELP resulting from the accidental inhalation of oily material. The main purpose of this survey was to present clinical and imagenological characteristics of acute ELP, explore its risk factors, and assess the potential role of multiple bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) and steroid therapy in the treatment of children with acute ELP.",

Oxygen saturation was measured with digital oximetry. Chest radiography and/or high-resolution computer tomography (CT) were performed in all patients. Diagnostic bronchoscopy was performed immediately after admission. Diagnostic bronchoscopy with BAL was performed once or more in all patients; 24 cases received BAL in combination with regional steroid (regional steroid means that inhaled corticosteroid such as budesonide was injected only into the affected segments or lobes through bronchoscopy in order to alleviate immunologic injury of lungs) therapy. It is instilled by using a syringe attached to the flexible pediatric bronchoscope. Fourteen persistent and severe cases received an empirical course of low-dose systemic steroids, and 11 were given pulmonary function tests. The patients were followed up periodically in the outpatient department. Twelve patients underwent follow-up chest radiographs at a mean interval of 1 mo (range: 5 d \u2013 3 mo). Twenty-one received follow-up CT scans at a mean interval of 3 mo (range: 2 wk \u2013 6 mo).",

Most of the pediatric patients [25 (75.8 %) of 33] came from rural areas, but no seasonal or yearly variation in the frequency of acute ELP was detected. By the time of the admission, most of the patients presented with respiratory distress and other symptoms, including tachypnea (n = 21), cough (n = 25), mild fever (n = 18), progressive dyspnea (n = 12), gasping (n = 8), and pneumorrhagia (n = 5). Two patients were asymptomatic. Fifteen cases received oxygen by nasal catheter or face mask, because their oxygen saturation levels were under 90 %. Twenty-three cases received antibiotics, and six received mechanical ventilation because of complicated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mean time between the onset of symptoms and the diagnostic bronchoscopy was 4.5 d.\n\n",

Exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP) is often overlooked as a cause of lung disease because of its nonspecific symptoms and radiographic appearance. Because the lesions manifest variable patterns and distribution in radiographic findings, the abnormalities may be misinterpreted as bacterial pneumonia or interstitial lung disease [5\u20137]. The diagnosis is suggested by the detailed clinical history and is confirmed by the finding of free lipids or lipids in the alveolar cell vacuoles in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The diagnosis of ELP is usually easy when a history of ingestion or inhalation of oily material is available, as in the present cases. Based on the presence of lipid-laden BAL fluid, and the fact that 2 h to 13 d had elapsed since the intake of oil-based substances by the time the patients were admitted, these cases were confirmed as those of acute ELP. Bronchoscopy with BAL is an effective method for establishing the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia in the absence of any information on ingestion of oily material.",

Sometimes, aspiration of oily material remains unnoticed because it does not induce a normal protective cough reflex; this can lead to severe, even fatal cases. Possible complications include bacterial infection, progressive fibrosis, bronchiectasis, hemoptysis, and in severe cases, respiratory failure or death [2, 4, 8]. In the index study, the majority of patients with acute ELP showed symptoms and forewarning signs similar to the findings of other reports [1, 8\u201310]. Secondary bacterial infection is common in acute ELP, but infection was detected in only four patients in the BAL culture, even though most patients presented with fever, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and elevation of C-reactive protein levels in the serum. Further researches are necessary to explore the reason why detection rate of BAL culture is so low. It is worth mentioning that ARDS was serious and very high-frequency complications of acute ELP in the index group compared to other reports [1, 7]. Pneumorrhagia, which was present in five of the present patients, is not a common phenomenon among adult patients. It can be explained by the fact that oil-based substances erode and injure the tender and soft mucosal lining of bronchi of infants more easily than that of adults and exacerbated by induced inflammatory cytokine storm; consequently, infants comprise the majority of the patient population. Two of the pneumorrhagia cases had inhaled fish-liver oil. Fish-liver oil is sold without a prescription, and no information is provided to the consumers or clinicians on the possible negative effects or hazards of using such products.",

However, none of the index patients had any of these physiological predisposing factors. It is critical to prevent accidental ingestion of oils because most of the patients were infants whose swallowing function was not fully developed. Their parents had put oil-based substances within their reach, leading to accidental aspiration. There are many oil-based substances that cause acute ELP, such as vegetable oil (olive), animal oil (milk and cod-liver oil), and mineral oil. Host tissue reactions to the inhaled substances differ according to the chemical characteristics of the substance. In the present group, aspiration of balsam and white oil were the most common causes of ELP. In authors\u2019 region, balsam (vegetable oil) is burnt as an incense in religious ceremonies. Balsam oil may impair mucociliary transport. Following balsam ingestion, the initial response in the alveoli is the phagocytosis of emulsified oil by alveolar macrophages. These lipid-laden macrophages are activated to release pro-inflammatory cytokines to elicit foreign body reactions associated with the infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells into the alveolar septum. Parents thus need to be aware of the risks, and discourage the uncontrolled use of balsam, especially in places where they can be accessed by the very young and the elderly. Preventive measures to avoid accidental inhalation of oils by children, and parental education about indiscriminate use of oily materials are necessary.",

All of the index patients showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and high-resolution CT revealed bilateral and extensive alveolar consolidations in most of the cases. Only two of the patients\u2019 CT scans revealed areas of ground-glass attenuation, and none revealed the paving pattern. These findings are consistent with those reported previously.",

Steroid therapy is one modality that has been used by several clinicians; some authors also suggest that removal of intrapulmonary fat using BAL may alleviate symptoms related to severe lipoid pneumonia [16\u201320]. In the present cases, authors used systemic steroid therapy as one of the treatment modalities for persistent and severe acute ELP, as it may prevent damage of alveolar and capillary endothelium, decrease the inflammatory response and ongoing fibrosis. Bronchoscopy with BAL is a successful strategy recommended for the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia because of the presence of floating lipid-laden macrophages in the BAL. Besides their diagnostic value, multiple BALs have therapeutic implications for children with ELP. The index cases showed clinical improvement after 1 to 5 wk of therapy, and showed almost complete radiological clearance within 3 mo. It suggests that multiple BALs are an efficient method for removing intra-alveolar mineral oil and offer considerable improvement in clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters. Pulmonary function tests showed obstructive ventilatory defect in nine cases; due to the young age of most of the index patients, this test could not be performed in most cases, as abnormal lung function tests may require several months of recovery [12]. Further, the follow-up investigation ignored post-treatment lung function, and thus no conclusions can be drawn regarding that aspect of recovery. Further studies are required to confirm the duration of abnormal lung function in children treated for acute ELP. Limitation of this report is that authors did not carry out a comparison of clinical, radiological data and follow-up data between the patients in whom lavage and steroids were used and those in whom they were not used. This is because authors used systemic steroid therapy as one of the treatment modalities just for persistent and severe acute ELP.",

            "text": "The natural history and outcome of ELP are variable, and depend on the type, volume, distribution, duration of the oil aspirated and a delay in BAL procedure. Mortality has been reported to be as high as 13\u201350 % by other researchers [2, 14], but in the index series, none of the patients died and had chronic respiratory problems. With treatment, majority of the patients with acute ELP showed clinical and radiographic improvement, similar to the usual course of pneumonia. The explanation possible could be young age of the cases and that they received timely diagnosis and appropriate administration. In conclusion, acute ELP as a result of aspiration of oily material still occurs in pediatric population. It can mimic other diffuse lung diseases because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and radiographic signs. The index study demonstrates that multiple BALs combined with steroid therapy result in significant improvement of clinical, radiologic and laboratory parameters in children with acute ELP. Systemic steroid therapy can be tried as one of the modalities, and is useful as a treatment for persistent and severe acute ELP. In addition, traditional habits (such as the use of oil for folk remedies or religious ceremonies) may predispose children to ELP, even in the absence of other risk factors. Pneumorrhagia and ARDS may represent the main complications of acute ELP in children.",
