Laboratory testing revealed a slight elevation of the white blood cell count (10.7 G/L) and a significant elevation of the C-reactive protein (235 mg/L). Hemocultures turned positive for multi-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. A left foot CT showed MTP I osteoarthritis without collection. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) showed no evidence of endocarditis. A double antibiotic regimen was started, but the patient developed persistent fever. Repeated TOE raised endocarditis suspicion. Because of a newly developed cough, a search for respiratory pathogens was performed and turned positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. An 18F-FDG PET/CT was requested for investigating the suspicion of PV infection with a 72-h low-carbohydrate diet preparation.",

In accordance with previous retrospective observations [3, 4], we confirmed the characteristic pattern of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection on 18F-FDG PET/CT with intense 18F-FDG uptake of pulmonary lesions, nodal involvement, and absence of other hypermetabolic lesions [3]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective case showing the feasibility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection when taking adequate protective measures [5].",
