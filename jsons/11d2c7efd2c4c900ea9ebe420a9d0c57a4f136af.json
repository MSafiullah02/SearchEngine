Serologic and antigen tests require that a patient with influenza-like-illness (ILI) be examined by a physician who can either conduct a rapid diagnosis test or take blood samples for laboratory testing. This suggests that many cases of influenza remain undiagnosed. While the presence of influenza in an individual can be confirmed through specific diagnostic tests, the influenza prevalence in the population at any given time is unknown and can only be estimated. In the past, such estimates have relied solely on the extrapolation of diagnosed cases, making it difficult to identify the various phases of seasonal influenza, or the identification of a more serious manifestation of a flu epidemic.",

There are accounts of epidemics dating back to the times of Hippocrates (459-377 BC) and the ancient Greeks [1] . Fourteenth century Europe lost a quarter of its 100 million people to Black Death. The fall of the Aztec empire in 1521 was due to smallpox that eradicated half of its 3.5 million population. The pandemic influenza of 1918 caused over 20 million excess deaths in 12 months. More recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 highlighted the rapid spread of an epidemic at the global level. The outbreak, emanating from a small Guangzhou province in China, spread around the world requiring a concerted response from public health administrations around the world and the World Health Organization (WHO) to curtail the epidemic [5] . The WHO and CDC [2] actively engage in worldwide surveillance of infectious diseases, and prioritize prevention and control measures at the root cause of epidemics.",

The results of such search queries often lead to sites that may help diagnose the illness and offer medical advice. Recently, Google has addressed this issue by capturing the keywords of queries and identifying specific searches that involve search terms that indicate influenza-like-illness (ILI) [4] . Published research on influenza Internet surveillance also includes search \"advertisement click-through\" [3] using a set of Yahoo search queries containing the words flu or influenza [9] and health website access logs [6, 7] . Other information sources, such as telephone triage services, can be useful to ILI detection. The findings in Yih et al. [11] show that telephone triage service is not a reliable measure for influenza surveillance due to service coverage; however, it may be beneficial in certain situations where other surveillance measures are inadequate.",

Bloggers who persistently author FC posts are less likely to be infected with influenza and more likely to be writing about avian influenza (bird flu). The following post excerpts demonstrate influenza-content author perspective. Identifying the perspective of influenza keyword posts facilitates determining its contribution to disease surveillance; three author perspectives have been identified. A FC post is either a self-identification of having ILI symptoms, secondhand (or by proxy) of another individual having ILI or the post is an opinion or objective article containing ILI keywords. Secondhand knowledge can be writing about a friend, schoolmate, family member or co-worker, but a blogger could also post details on a famous individual such as a sports player. The season opening of American football coincides with the data and many FC posts identify athletes who are unable to play because of an ILI.
