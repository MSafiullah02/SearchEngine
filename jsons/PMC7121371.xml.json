Without this microscopic support, our anatomical constituents and our diet would have been completely different. The diets of carnivores and herbivores are also dependent on the microbial helpers these animals possess. The cows we see grazing would not be engaging in such an activity if it was not for the microbe-laden stomach they have. Indeed, humans also have evolved to be reliant on microbes to carry numerous functions they are not able to execute without the assistance of their traditional organs. Without the presence of these microbes, human anatomy and physiology would have been entirely different; we would not have been biologically the way we are. Thus, it is not surprising that if this harmonious relationship is perturbed, major complications may arise with disastrous consequences to the bodily operation. In fact, the delicate balance among the microbial ecosystems needs to be preserved if the body is to function normally. The metabolically compatible members of this community work in harmony and as they are assigned a specific job that enables the community to function properly. This synergy breeds inter-dependence and a specialization of functions. The community forges a collective work ethic amongst all the stake-holders. Constant interspecies communication ensures that their activity is controlled and excessive growth is under check. However, perturbation of this fine microbial-balancing act can result in debilitating impact on the host.",

This situation is similar to the operation of our social communities. For instance, if there is an excessive amount of doctors and limited number of nurses and other health professionals, the medical delivery system becomes sick. The disruption in the microbial community is bound to create a shift in the families, genera or species of the resident microbes. This can be fatal or make the business of living unpleasant. Numerous diseases are known to be triggered by the disturbance of microbial population within the body. The imbalance of the microbiome is referred to as dysbiosis (Fig. 3.1). Diet, physical stress, exercise, psychological distress, radiation, flying, humidity, geographical location, age and medications including antibiotics have been shown to exert demonstrable change in the microbial landscape in the body. For instance, ampicillin utilization leads to a sharp decrease in the gut microbiome, while the antibiotic, cefoxilin perturbs the fine balance by promoting the proliferation of Clostridium difficile at the expense of other microbes. The amount of some Lactobacillus species is sharply diminished during flight and may lead to anxiety associated with air travel. The increased levels of catecholamine produced during stress trigger the growth of pathogenic microbes like E.coli and impede the proliferation of good microbes like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. Farm workers who are exposed to pesticides suffer a similar diminution in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. Exposure to metal pollution like cadmium limits the amount of micro-organisms belonging to the family of Bacteriodes that in turn is reflected in reduction of metabolites like SCFA (short-chain fatty acids), contributors to numerous pivotal functions in the body as we have seen before. These changes lead to various abnormalities (Fig. 3.2).",

Geography, pollution, ultraviolet radiation (UV-R), occupation and the host biology are major contributors to the skin microbiome. Injury, chronic conditions, infection, cosmetics and the use of hygiene products may result in a shift in the bacterial communities. UV-R promotes the release of anti-microbial peptides that may block the body\u2019s immune system and creates an environment for the cancer-causing viruses to flourish. Chemicals like triclosan, a common ingredient in household products like soap and toothpaste can perturb the fine microbial balance. This is further compounded by the inherent diverse landscape that the skin offers; the face is oily, hairy and exposed to environment while the axilla is occluded, moist and laden with microbial nutrients. The dysbiosis triggered by the host of environmental and microbial-driven features are at the origin of numerous skin diseases. For instance, the atopic dermatitis that is a chronic pruritic inflammatory disorder is characterized by an overwhelming increase in Staphylococcus aureus. A decrease in filaggrin, a microbial sensing protein coupled with a decrease in dermicidin, a peptide defending bacterial invasion results in this lack of microbial diversity and the proliferation of a select few microbes. Prebiotics like fucosylated oligosaccharides derived from chicory roots and probiotics like Staphylococcus epidermis are being introduced in cream to fight dermal dysbiosis.",

Increased colonization by this organism provides a fertile landscape for the nasty Streptococcus to proliferate. The tight-knit functional community is unraveled.

The ensuing diminished biodiversity propelled by the over-representation of the genera Staphylococcus belonging to the Firmicutes family automatically leads to a reduction in other family members that had bonded into this dermal community and learnt to live in harmony. In this instance, the territorial presence of members belonging to the Acetinobacteria family is restrained. Thus, begins the initiation of psoriasis. Environmental factors like temperature, humidity or presence of cosmetics on our skin may hasten the onset and the severity of this malady. The establishment of the unbalanced microbial community residing in the psoriatic lesions generate antimicrobial peptides and other modulators that hyper-activate the body\u2019s immune system. This reaction modifies the life-cycle of the skin cells that respond by growing rapidly, a situation culminating in itchy, dry, red plaques. These become the hub of other uncontrolled microbial activity and can aggravate into psoriatic arthritis. Wound healing in diabetic patients is a problem as cuts on the skin of these individuals take unusually longer time to repair. Here again the inability to effectively recover from wounds is again due to the uncontrolled proliferation of certain microbes at the expense of others. The sugary environment provided by the diabetic blood and the presence of other nutrients create an ideal ecosystem for the multiplication of Staphylococcus. This nutrient-rich landscape on the skin-cut acts as a magnet for some bacteria and disrupts the harmony among the otherwise orderly community members. This microbial imbalance is a recipe for disaster and opens the body for invasion as some of our trusted partners are either too small in numbers to make any difference or are completely wipe-out of our intimate landscape by the opportunistic intruders. And wound healing becomes a very abnormal exercise for the body to partake in the absence of some of the invisible allies.",

The chemical landscape of the saliva plays an important role in the establishment of the microbial communities that reside in the buccal cavity. Nearly 108 microorganisms are found in one milliliter of saliva, a fluid rich in proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and enzymes. The presence of lactoferrin, lysozyme and lactoperoxidase act in concert to dissuade the colonization by fortuitous bacteria. Hydrogen peroxide, hypothiocyanite and nitric oxide derived from nitrate in foods are potent antimicrobial and are part of the defense armoury deployed to fend against cariogenic intruders. However, poor hygiene, nutritional habits, smoking and diseases like diabetes tend to weaken this defense. The presence of increased glucose level generates acidic metabolites that drop the pH of the mouth from 7.0 to 4.0. This promotes the acid tolerant microbe like Staphylococcus mutans and results in an increase in the Firmicutes family coupled with a decrease in the Bacteriodetes family. The solubilization of calcium and phosphate is preceded by a variety of dental diseases. Furthermore, the dysbiosis created by this situation leads to reduction of nitrate reducing bacteria, a situation restricting the output of nitric oxide, NO. This has major health impact including cardiovascular complications. The use of chlorhexidine containing mouthwash also has a negative influence on NO-producing bacteria. Hence, the saliva and its microbial residents are an important contributor to a healthy outcome.",

The hyperactive immune response can also damage other parts of the body like the eyes, lungs and skin. This dysregulation of the immune system triggers pro-inflammatory tendencies with an increase in T-lymphocytes and self-reactive antibodies. Although genetic factors may contribute to this disorder, a major shift in the constituents of the microbiome is observed in RA patients. There is an overrepresentation in the Provetella species including Provetella copri, an increase in Clostridium spp and a reduction in Bacteriodes spp. This dysbiosis evokes the elevated production of homocysteine, hydrogen sulphide and lipopolyssacharide (LPS) that all known to promote inflammation, a feature culminating in the attack of one\u2019s own body part. Probiotics like Lactobacillus casei has been shown to mitigate symptoms associated with RA. Asthma is another inflammatory disease where the respiratory airways are challenged by the aggressive action of the immune system. There is an overproduction of mucus and an intense remodeling of the airway wall ensues. The presence of dust, pollen and spores tend to aggravate this situation. However, this disease is characterized by a marked change in the lung microbiota. In children there is reduction in such microbes as the Faecalcibacteria, Veillonella and Rothia while in adults an increase in Proteobacteria and a decrease in Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes are common.

Despite the inhospitable environment presented by this acidic organ, the microbes belonging to the Helicobacter spp have set-up their home here. They have done so by learning how to tame the low pH these environs are immersed in. They cling to the mucus of the cell-wall where the acidity tends to a bit more manageable. By neutralising this unfriendly territory, these microbes are able to develop a friendly habitat where they can reside. Even with these territorial adjustments, the stomach is the organ that harbours the least amounts of bacteria. However, the perturbation of this microclimate can quickly change this microbial landscape. The intake of medications like the proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics tend to promote a shift in this microbial population to the upper confines of the gastrointestinal tract. Once, this uncontrolled colony is established, it produces ammonia that compels an empty stomach to generate acid. It is critical that this digestive compartment is acidic only when it has food in its midst. Any change in the acidity in the absence of food distresses this organ. It is more or less like the stomach is chewing itself. This becomes the genesis of aches and heartburns that result into peptic ulcers. There is a rise in this microbially-induced disease around the world and the disruption of the fine working arrangement struck among the invisible residents may be at play. It is not surprising that the majority of ulcers can be cured by antibiotics and not by drugs aimed at diminishing the acidity of stomach, a finding that has dismayed many pharmaceutical companies as they have invested heavily on the incorrect cause of the disease.

Ice-cream, cookies, toothpaste and laxatives are some of the products where this polysaccharide provides texture, viscosity and structural integrity. Despite being mostly composed of glucose, CMC cannot be digested either by the visible or the invisible organs. However, it creates a major ecological change in the gut by interfering with mucin, a natural barrier lining the gut. Mucin is heavily glycosylated and act as a potent fence against any opportunistic pathogens to access the inner walls of the intestine. It inhibits the absorption of dietary flavonoids and also promotes the proliferation of microbial flora desired by the body. These functions are perturbed by CMC as it shares some chemical and physical features with mucin.

This flux in the gut ecosystem creates conditions for the abnormal proliferation of some members at the expense of others. The subsequent activation of enzymes and production of disease-causing factors can contribute to such maladies as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colorectal cancer, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular complications and neurological disorders. Some of the metabolic diseases like diabetes, obesity and heart ailments have reached an epidemic proportion globally. A recent report revealed there are more obese people than underweight individuals, a phenomenon that is a first for human history. An average person has become 1.5 kg heavier over each decade. Thus, if your grand-father was say 50 kg, your dad is 65 kg and you will be 80 kg at the same age of course. This scenario will be true if nothing else changes. The study on body mass index that was done over 40 years in 186 countries is alarming indeed. Policies on food and the quality of food we have access to will help to some extent.

The gut microbiome is an important participant in the manner we digest food, extract the maximal energy and nourish the rest of the organs. A disruption in the microbial landscape can trigger metabolic diseases. For instance, during irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) microbes belonging to the Firmicutes family decrease while an increase in members of the Bacteroidetes family is observed. This disorder in the intricate microbial balance propels a concomitant rise in facultative bacteria like the Enterobacteriae spp. The unregulated establishment of the microbial community tends to impair the integrity of the mucus lining of the intestine. This shift perturbs the ability of the resident intestinal microbes to properly communicate with the mucosal barrier; such a situation results in the inability of the body to tolerate the harmless bacteria and neutralize the invading squatters. Following this distress imposed on this natural fence, conditions are perfect for the release of signals and chemical shuttles by the microbes to enable their migration across the intestinal defensive wall. This sequence of events forces the host to activate its guards with no clear mandate on the proper target and the result is an unintended inflammation giving rise to Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. These are the two most prevalent forms of IBS that can be traced to the perturbation of microbes residing in the gut. In fact, these diseases can be mitigated by increasing the presence of Firmicutes in the gastro-intestinal tract. It is clear that the conditions promoting the opportunistic microbes and the colonizing factors they produce are at the root cause of these disorders and re-establishing the original microbial communities goes a long in alleviating the pain of individuals suffering from these complications.",

Lean individuals tend to have higher amounts of microbes belonging to the Bacteriodetes family while obese subjects and those suffering from metabolic syndrome are home to more members from the Firmicutes family. Although the specific species of these two microbial families responsible for the lean and obese traits have yet be catalogued, it is clear that obesity is characterized with increased levels of toxins like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the blood. Symptoms associated with weight gain and decreased sensitivity to insulin have been attributed to the presence of microbial toxins.

Dopamine production is impeded and there is an increased formation of aggregated neurotoxic protein known as \u03b1-synuclein. These two biochemical manifestations may be shaped by the nature of the microbial residents by limiting precursors of dopamine and activating the immune system with the release of pro-inflammatory chemicals like LPS. The gut microbiome in Parkinson\u2019s patients is usually characterized by a decrease in Prevotella spp and an increase in Enterobacteria spp. A diminution of mucin synthesis increases intestinal permeability and leads to an acute dysbiosis that contributes to the abdominal discomfort, bloating and premature satiety reported in these patients. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are another set of neurological perturbations leading to social and behavioural impairments including repetitive behaviours and non-standard communications.

Indeed it has been shown that Africans from rural areas exhibit lower risk of colon and rectal cancers due to the increased abundance of the microbes known as Bacteroides spp. These are avid producers of short-chain fatty acid like butyrate, an important energy-producer and a promoter of cellular growth. This is a critical signaling molecule that can goad the body to synthesize sentinels that stop cancer cells on their tract.",

This phenomenon is the leading cause of the decrease of metabolic activities and in some cases of physiological abnormalities observed in seniors. The lower abundance of Bifidobacteria coupled with the increased presence of Enterobacteriaceae is a common predictor of the ageing process and such a shift in microbial population is responsible for the diminished production of enzymes and essential vitamins like vitamin B that are critical in maintaining a constant supply of energy in the body. There is also a build-up of toxic products as the proper microbial communities involved in their decomposition are severely hampered. This situation is analogous to someone not going to the toilet on regular basis.

The mission of these microbes may be compared to the role stem cells play in rejuvenating the organs and extending their functional life span (Fig 3.19). In this instance the diversity of the microbes observed in centenarians may be allowing these microbiota to supplement some of the functions their visible organs cannot perform or to generate chemical ingredients triggering the proper physiological responses from these ageing organs.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one such disease where a perturbation in microbial population is the main cause of the disease. This shift in the ecosystem of the microbiota is punctuated by a loss in immune tolerance and a rise in inflammatory response. To mitigate this situation and to remedy this ailment, the administration of probiotics like E.coli Nissle has been relatively more effective than the use of antibiotics. In this instance, the probiotics appear to deliver a three-pronged attack on the invasive and crafty microbes. They improve the fence lining the intestine, they out-compete the bad bacteria and they secrete molecular soldiers like hydrogen peroxide and lactate that stop invaders right on their tract. The significance of probiotics as therapeutic agents is only now beginning to be appreciated and is slowly challenging the aggressive use of antibiotics in treating these conditions. Unfortunately, antibiotic-based remedies tend to seriously interfere with the workings of our microbiome as their action against toxic microbes also eliminates some of our trusted invisible partners. The uncontrolled proliferation of the stomach residing Helicobacter pylori is a cause of concern as it is a risk factor for gastroduodenal ulcers and lymphomas. The intake of probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus has been demonstrated to correct this imbalance. The ability of these probiotics to secrete SCFA like acetate and butyrate is known to be a key factor in impeding the march of the over-reactive H. pylori. Wound healing and cancer prevention are other two activities that probiotics are also involved in. Lactobacillus acidophilus that is an excellent candidate with the power to heal injuries is known to arrest the colonization driven by the scheming Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The acidic environment nurtured by the Lactobacillus renders the ability to conquer the tear on the skin almost impossible. The propensity of probiotics to bind to mutagenic compounds and inhibit the production of carcinogens by opportunistic pathogens is central for their anti-tumour activity. The lactic acid producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus lactis are routinely being recommended for the prevention of cancers. Some select tumours like in colorectal cancers are being treated with the aid of these life-microbial concoctions. Hence it comes as no surprise that the use of probiotics as a prevention of diseases and a therapy against some specific disorders is on the rise. The commercial value of this industry is into hundreds of billions of dollars, a figure that is further expected to increase as probiotics are safe and well-tolerated in children, premature infants and in the general population as a whole. Furthermore, unlike pharmaceutical products, probiotics are very easily administered mostly as components of foods and the lingering effects of these chemicals are quickly becoming a relic of the past.",

In 450 BC Hippocrates had noted the laxative attribute of coarse wheat compared to the refined variety. In the 1920s Kellogg sang the praise of bran as a nutrient that increased stool weight, prevented diseases and acted as a laxative. All health gurus extoll the praise of the nutritional quality of fiber-rich foods. After a relative quiet epoch in the health benefits of the dietary fibers, their involvement in mitigating ailments like obesity, cardiovascular disorders and diabetes were widely revived in the 1970s and has now become a staple of balanced nutrition. The main prebiotics are the galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) obtained from milk, inulin associated-fructo-sugar (FOS) found in chicory roots and xylooligosaccharides (XOS) present in plant products like palm oil and corn plants. They also occur naturally in milk, asparagus, garlic, onion, leeks, wheat, oats and soya beans. They are soluble, resistant to the acidic environment in the stomach, fermentable and stimulate growth or the activity of intestinal microbes responsible for the well-being of the host. Prebiotics tend to be relatively selective to microorganisms like Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides. They are converted into simpler derivatives before they reach the colon. Here they act as an anchor for the establishment of a unique ecosystem that is aimed at aiding the host in accomplishing a variety of tasks. They generate energy that fuels the muscles and the colon. They are also involved in repressing allergic symptoms. The reduction of infection and promoting the proliferation of good microbes like Akkermansia are some other positive features prebiotics contribute to.

The utilization of FOS prebiotics like inulin-laced pasta decreases the bacterial LPS, suppresses the hunger signal, promotes satiety and increases microbial diversity events aimed at countering obesity. A prebiotics is an effective means in controlling weight gain. Cardiovascular diseases do also respond well to prebiotics therapy. Water soluble fibers such as pectin found in fruits and guar gum from guar beans are known to decrease the bad cholesterol (LDL low density lipoprotein) without affecting the good cholesterol (HDL high density lipoprotein). They also help lower the blood pressure. The positive influence of these prebiotics on the functioning of the heart has been widely documented and accepted as a means of averting cardiovascular diseases.

In the case of keratoconus, an eye condition where the cornea loses its focusing power, the surgical administration of vitamin B2 allows the eye to function normally. In this instance, the infusion of vitamin B2 promotes the cross-linking of collagen, a biological event that fortifies the cornea and enables it to contribute to visual sensation. The same can be said of lipoic acid and calcium supplements. The former helps fortify the workings of the brain while the latter enable the proper functioning of the skeletal system.

The blending of live microbes and the microbial fertilizers that enable them to thrive is a very powerful tool to goad the constituents of the invisible organ in executing a dedicated task. For instance, muscle wasting and inflammation that characterize cancer cachexia has been shown to be mitigated with a concoction of a synbiotic consisting of Lactobacillus reuteri and inulin-based fructans (FOS). The intake of this synbiotic reduces the population of Enterobacteriacae, replenishes the Lactobacillus colonies and prolongs the life of the patients. The therapeutic value of the FOS and lactobacilli taken together in combatting hemorrhage triggered by bacterial infection has also been recognized. In this instance, a sharp decrease in E.coli counts coupled with an increase in the population of Lactobacillus spp contribute to bringing relief to these patients. Quite often a cocktail of drugs is prescribed to combat a viral infection; this can be equated to synbiotic therapy. The AIDS virus, can only be eliminated from the blood system of infected individuals by the use of anti-proteases and medications inhibiting the replication of the viral genetic code.
