            "text": "Identification of potential SARS-CoV antiviral compounds has progressed swiftly, thanks in part to the availability of bioinformatic and virus structural data. Antivirals that target the SARS-CoV superfamily 1 helicase and the 3C-related serine proteinase with low micromolar EC 50 values have been reported. [1] [2] [3] The papain-related cysteine proteinase may prove to be an unsuitable target, as a coronavirus molecular clone lacking one of the two known cleavage sites for this enzyme displayed only minor growth defects in cell culture. 4 Other confirmed and putative viral enzymes including the polymerase, poly(U)specific endo-ribonuclease homolog, S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent ribose 2'-Omethyltransferase, and cyclic phosphodiesterase represent plausible anti-SARS targets. 5 Antivirals targeting the interaction of the viral spike protein with the ACE-2 receptor, 2, 3, 6 or with the spike-mediated fusion event, [7] [8] [9] [10] and showing micromolar-scale efficiency in cell culture, have been reported. Several groups have also reported antiviral in vitro efficacy with siRNAs. 11 The antisense agents directed against single-stranded RNA are known to act by two general mechanisms: by causing damage to an RNA strand containing the complementary \"target\" sequence through priming of endogenous RNase H activity, or by stably binding to and steric interference with targeted RNA function. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) act by the latter mechanism, duplexing to specific RNA sequence by Watson-Crick base pairing and forming a steric block. 12 The most frequently successful targeting strategies for PMO-based gene knockdown involve interfering with translation initiation 13 or masking splice sites. 14 We recently demonstrated antiviral effects in vitro for one peptide-conjugated PMO (P-PMO) complementary to the AUG translation start site region of a murine coronavirus replicase polyprotein. 15 We reasoned that antiviral effects of P-PMO might be improved by choosing conserved RNA sequence elements and secondary structures critical for replication, transcription, and host factor interaction as targets. In this report, we demonstrate that antisense-mediated suppression of viral replication can be achieved by targeting conserved RNA elements required for viral RNA synthesis and translation.",

In this assay, cells were treated with P-PMO 1 h after inoculation with a standardized amount of SARS-CoV. Plaque diameter was measured 72 h after inoculation. The TRS2 P-PMO was most effective at reducing SARS-CoV spread in cell culture (Fig. 1C) . We reasoned that inhibition of viral growth should correspond with a decrease in the viral RNA level, whether through inhibition of replicase expression, interference with discontinuous RNA synthesis at the leader TRS, or an alternate mechanism. Coronaviruses produce a nested set of sub-genome-length RNA species in infected cells. We investigated genomic and subgenomic RNA production 24 h after low-multiplicity inoculation. RT-PCR products specific to each of eight subgenomic RNA species were strongly amplified from untreated cells and cells treated with less effective P-PMO ( Fig. 1D and data not shown) . Equal volumes of RT-PCR products from an equivalent number of infected cells pretreated with 20 \u00b5M TRS2 P-PMO were faint (i.e., sgRNA 8 and possibly 9) or undetectable (sgRNA 2-7; Fig. 1D ). Genomic RNA synthesis was likewise qualitatively reduced by 20 \u00b5M TRS2 P-PMO (data not shown).",

In order to assess the propensity for SARS-CoV to develop resistance to antisense P-PMO, a stock cultured from a plaque-purified biological clone of SARS-CoV was serially passaged on cells pretreated with P-PMO. Viral growth was assessed, after each passage ( Fig. 2A) . Treatment with 10 \u00b5M TRS2 P-PMO strongly inhibited SARS-CoV growth for several passages. However, an increase in titer indicative of partial resistance was observed after seven passages. SARS-CoV plaque purified after 11 rounds of TRS2 P-PMO selection formed small plaques on Vero-E6 cells in the absence of P-PMO (Fig. 2B) . TRS2 P-PMO-selected SARS-CoV displayed delayed growth kinetics compared with untreated SARS-CoV and other P-PMO-selected SARS-CoV (data not shown). RNA was isolated from plaque purified SARS-CoV selected after 11 rounds of serial P-PMO treatment. RT-PCR amplicons from 14 serially P-PMO-treated SARS-CoV were sequenced to determine whether the virus had undergone mutation during P-PMO selection. Three contiguous base changes of CTC to AAA at position 61-63, proximal to the leader TRS and within the target region of TRS2-P-PMO, appeared in only the 14 amplicons from TRS2-resistant SARS-CoV (Fig.  2C ).",

Moulton et al., construct in which the luciferase reporter gene was placed immediately downstream of either the wild-type SARS-CoV TRS region or the same region with the CTC AAA mutations observed in TRS2 P-PMO-selected SARS-CoV clones (Fig. 3A) . TRS2 P-PMO was approximately ten-fold less active against the 3-mismatch TRS target compared with the wild-type target (EC 50 of 500nM and 50 nM, respectively). The decreased sensitivity to TRS2 P-PMO was consistent with reduced P-PMO/target RNA duplex stability in partially-TRS2-resistant SARS-CoV. A similar observation was recently reported for HIV-1 escape variants resistant to siRNAs. 17 569 manuscript in preparation and ). P-PMO binding affinity was compared using a reporter 16 Figure 2 . Escape of SARS-CoV after serial P-PMO passage. The titer of infectious SARS-CoV grown over nine rounds of treatment with selected P-PMOs was measured by TCID 50 titration (A). Error bars indicate standard error throughout. Plaque morphology of P-PMO-resistant SARS-CoV strains was assessed in the absence of P-PMO. Mean plaque diameter is shown (B). SARS-CoV strains selected after serial P-PMO treatment were sequenced. The region comprising the TRS2 P-PMO binding site is shown (C). Sequences from untreated and DSCR-treated SARS-CoV represent wild-type sequence, and mutations found in all TRS2selected strains are underlined. Sequence is from the complementary (minus-sense) strand. The antiviral effects of TRS2 P-PMO were consistent with multiple mechanisms of action. In order to determine whether the high efficacy of TRS2 could be attributed to steric blockade of translation, a reporter construct was designed in which luciferase expression was initiated at the AUG codon of the authentic SARS-CoV replicase open reading frame 1a AUG, downstream of the SARS-CoV 5'-untranslated region. TRS2 P-PMO was much more effective than AUG1 P-PMO in inhibiting reporter translation (EC 50 of 35 nM vs. 185 nM ; Fig, 3B ). The TRS2 target site (bases 55-75) is sufficiently distal from both the 5'-terminus and the site of translation initiation to make it unlikely that interference with events of pre-initiation at the terminus (e.g., the 43S complex loading onto mRNA) or initiation at the initiator AUG (e.g., 48S-complex formation and/or joining of 48S and 60S ribosomal subunits) forms the basis for the observed effect. We therefore concluded that TRS2 P-PMO primarily inhibits SARS-CoV growth by interference with translation, perhaps at the 43S-preinitiation complex scanning. ",
