Less than 25 years ago Bishop and Lansing (1982) started an overview of normal and pathological anatomy of the human spleen stating that the spleen is \u201can organ of unique anatomic and functional importance, and yet the morphologic correlates of its various functions remain somewhat mysterious.\u201d Our own review, which appeared a decade later (Kraal, 1992), was probably the first that focused on the marginal zone only and described the constituents and function of this area as they were known at that time. It is striking how much data and new insights have been generated since then, and from how many different angles of interest the spleen and the marginal zone have been studied. Especially from the field of developmental immunology, but also from that of studies on pattern recognition receptors and B cell immunology, many exciting new data on the function of the spleen and the interactions between the various cells and molecules have been generated and have helped to solve at least some of the mysteries. Here we will describe these findings correlated with the function of the spleen, and the intriguing marginal zone in particular.",

            "text": "The spleen is composed of a branching splenic artery that eventually ends in venous sinuses. The arterial branches, called central arterioles, are surrounded by a layer of lymphoid tissue as a continuous sheath, the white pulp. It consists of T cell areas and B cell follicles, more or less resembling the organization found in lymph nodes, except for the apparent absence of high endothelial venules. Although smaller branches of the central arteriole run through the white pulp, most of the arterial blood (Schmidt et al., 1993) ends in a sinusoid system in the area surrounding the T and B cell zones, thereby forming an anatomical border between the white and red pulp, the marginal zone (Kraal, 1992). It is here that the blood opens up in sinusoid spaces formed by lining cells continuous with the endothelium of the arterioles. Especially in rodents, in which the spleen has been investigated most thoroughly, the marginal zone is a conspicuous area consisting of a network of sinus lining cells and reticular fibroblasts through which the blood freely percolates on its way to the red pulp. Macrophage populations and marginal zone B cells are firmly attached to this network, thus allowing a continuous scan of the blood for pathogens and debris. In humans the marginal zone can be divided into an inner and outer area with a small rim of T cell zone in between and surrounded by a more diffuse perifollicular zone where macrophages can be found that surround endings of blood vessels (Mebius 2005, Steiniger 2001). The blood runs from the marginal zone through the red pulp cords into the venous sinuses, whereby the structure of the venous cords and sinuses, forming the spleen's red pulp, leads to a functional slow bloodstream, enabling the spleen to exert its function as a filter of the blood. The passage from the cords into the sinuses is an important step for the selection of effete red blood cells and their removal by the macrophages of the red pulp. Interestingly, the splenic vein is connected to the hepatic portal vein, so that all the blood leaving the spleen is then filtered by the portal system of the liver.",

            "text": "That marginal zone macrophages are capable of recognizing polysaccharide antigens and play a role in T cell\u2010independent antibody responses has been well established in earlier studies (Amlot 1985, Amlot 1985, Humphrey 1981, Kraal 1989b). With the discovery of DC\u2010SIGN as a human dendritic cell\u2010specific C\u2010type lectin (van Kooyk and Geijtenbeek, 2003) and subsequent isolation of murine homologues, the SIGNR1 molecule was identified as an important C\u2010type lectin present on marginal zone macrophages and responsible for recognition of carbohydrate antigens (Geijtenbeek 2002a, Park 2001). The C\u2010type lectin domain of mouse SIGNR1 has 74% similarity with that of human DC\u2010SIGN, and the amino acid residues important for both Ca2+ and ligand binding are conserved in the murine homologue (Geijtenbeek et al., 2002b). The ligand\u2010binding specificities of SIGNR1 are therefore quite similar to the ones described for DC\u2010SIGN, based on the presence of the EPN sequence motif in the carbohydrate recognizing domain (CRD). The EPN motif determines their affinity, in particular to mannose\u2010containing carbohydrates, but additional amino acids in the CRD will determine the specific structures that are recognized (Appelmelk 2003, Feinberg 2001, Galustian 2004), and many of the pathogens that are recognized by DC\u2010SIGN can also interact with SIGNR1 (see Table I\n). Detailed analysis of the carbohydrate specificity of SIGNR1 showed interaction with mannose\u2010, fucose\u2010, and N\u2010acetylglucosamine\u2010terminating oligosaccharides, as demonstrated by their ability to react with high mannose N\u2010glycans and proteins containing N\u2010linked glycans such as invertase and soybean agglutinin. That SIGNR1 also reacts with fucose was inferred from binding studies with Lewis antigens (Galustian et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The SIGNR1 molecule is sufficient for both binding and internalization of ligands, after which the complex is localized in lysosomes, as shown by transfected cells (Geijtenbeek et al., 2002a). The cytoplasmic region of the murine SIGNR1 lacks a dileucine motif that is responsible for the internalization of human DC\u2010SIGN, but it contains a triacid cluster (DDD) in its cytoplasmic region (Koppel 2004, Park 2001). This motif functions as an internalization motif in DEC\u2010205, an endocytic receptor on dendritic cells, where it is responsible for targeting to lysosomes for antigen processing (Mahnke et al., 2000). It is therefore assumed that the lysosomal targeting of internalized ligand\u2013SIGNR1 complexes is due to this triacidic cluster. Indications that the SIGNR1 receptor can also interact with other receptors begin to emerge. Cooperation with Dectin\u20101, the \u03b2\u2010glucan receptor, leads to efficient uptake of zymosan and production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03b1 (Taylor et al., 2004), although this is probably not as relevant for the situation in the marginal zone where dectin\u20101 is hardly expressed (Reid et al., 2004). For marginal zone macrophages the observed interaction of SIGNR1 with the Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) 4 seems to be more important (Nagaoka et al., 2005). In studies on the ligand specificity of SIGNR1 it was observed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli bound to SIGNR1 via oligosaccharides in the nonreductive end of the LPS core region. In transfectant cells with both SIGNR1 and TLR4, LPS binding to SIGNR1 led to oligomerization of TLR4 and degradation of I\u03baB\u2010\u03b1 and it was found that SIGNR1 associated with the TLR4\u2212MD2 complex leading to cytokine production (Nagaoka et al., 2005). It is obvious that this type of interaction greatly enhances the efficiency by which the marginal zone macrophages can eliminate pathogens.",

            "text": "As for SIGNR1, the expression of the Macrophage Associated Receptor with COllagenous structure (MARCO) is not restricted to marginal zone macrophages, but it is the combination of these receptors that makes these cells special. Furthermore, the expression of MARCO seems to be constitutive on marginal zone macrophages, whereas it can be rapidly induced on many other macrophage populations, such as alveolar macrohages and macrophages in the liver (Arredouani 2004, Elomaa 1995, van der Laan 1999). This enables the body to initiate a swift and functional upregulation of pattern recognition receptors under conditions of heavy pathogen load. For MARCO a broad range of pathogenic ligands has been described, whereby MARCO and SIGNR1 are often complementary in their specificity. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus readily bind to MARCO, whereas yeast cells (zymosan) do not (Elomaa et al., 1995). Ficoll, which is avidly captured by the marginal zone macrophages, does not bind to MARCO, whereas acetylated low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) does (Kraal et al., 2000). When MARCO is expressed in other cell types in vitro it induces changes in cell shape, and profound changes in cytoskeleton rearrangements, which may be related to the function of the molecule in the cellular changes needed to accommodate phagocytosis and engulfment of larger particles (Granucci 2003, Pikkarainen 1999).",

Group B members are composed of tandem repeats of SRCR domains, thought to be involved in oligomerization but never associated with protease domains. Representatives of either group are found in different animal species, from low invertebrates (sponges) to high vertebrates (mammals), and it is thought that based on the high degree of structural and phylogenetic conservation of SRCR domains, they have basic functions in innate immune defense (Lehrer 2004, Sarrias 2004).",

A role for this enzyme in cleaving fatty acids as well as for the detoxification of LPS has been described, as well as a direct association of NSE and removal of apoptotic T cells by macrophages in the thymus (Feng et al., 2002). This suggests that the marginal metallophilic macrophages are involved in scavenging pathogens and apoptotic cells based on the function of NSE in membrane destabilization. In line with this is the abundant expression of Siglec\u20101 (sialoadhesin) on these cells (Fig. 1C), a receptor associated with binding to oligosaccharide self ligands on many cells and extracellular matrix components (Crocker 1995, Crocker 1997). The family of siglecs (sialic acid\u2010binding Ig\u2010like lectins) can be divided into two subsets, the highly related and large group of CD33\u2010related siglecs, and a second group composed of sialoadhesin, CD22, and myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein (MAG). Although the latter group is more distantly related, it is represented by well\u2010conserved orthologues in all mammalian species examined so far (Crocker, 2005). Except for MAG, all siglecs are expressed on cells of the immune system and consist of an N\u2010terminal V\u2010set Ig domain that mediates sialic acid binding, and a number of C2\u2010set Ig\u2010like domains. Furthermore, several of them contain immunoreceptor tyrosine\u2010based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in their cytoplasmic tails, suggestive of a role in immune regulation, but the precise role of the various siglecs, with the exception of CD22, is still not clear. Sialoadhesin, which in addition to its expression on marginal metallophilic macrophages is also found on macrophage subsets at inflammatory sites and in tumors, differs from other siglecs by the fact that it is constitutively active. Most others siglecs are thought to be masked through cis interactions with sialylated ligands on the same plasma membrane and have to be activated, e.g., by sialidases to become functional. That this is not the case for sialoadhesin could be due to the fact that with its 17 domains it stands out from the crowd of other molecules in the plasma membrane and is therefore less likely to interact in cis (Crocker 1994, Munday 1999).",

Based on the position of marginal metallophilic macrophages at the entrance site of the marginal zone and white pulp, a role for sialoadhesin in lymphocyte migration has been suggested. Activation of lymphocytes leads to changes in the glycosylation patterns of molecules such as CD43, CD45, and PSGL\u20101, all of which are ligands for sialoadhesin based on expression of clustered sialic acids. Their interaction may facilitate the retention of lymphocytes in the transit zone and subsequent entrance into the white pulp (Crocker et al., 1997). In fact, elimination of macrophages from the marginal zone with the use of toxic liposomes led to reduced entrance of lymphocytes into the white pulp, although it cannot be completely ruled out that this was related to general changes in the hemodynamics in the marginal zone (Kraal et al., 1989a). Also for blood\u2010borne tumor cells with altered glycosylation, binding and removal through sialoadhesin have been suggested (Nath et al., 1999).",

In a study on the migration of dermal macrophages into lymph nodes it was found that these cells interacted with the sialoadhesin expressed on the subcapsular macrophages in the node through M galactose C\u2010type lectins (MGL1). This interaction was independent of sialic acid but involved N\u2010glycans on the stalk of the sialoadhesin molecule (Kumamoto et al., 2004). In light of the aforementioned similarities between these subcapsular and the marginal metallophilic macrophages, similar interactions can be expected to occur in the marginal zone and it will be very interesting to see what cell types are involved.",

            "text": "To what extent are MZ B cells different from follicular B cells and how is this determined? Together with the B\u20101 B cells, MZ B cells are encompassed in the group of innate lymphocytes, of which the antigen receptor repertoire is germ\u2010line encoded with limited diversity (Bendelac et al., 2001), and they are not part of a constantly migrating lymphocyte pool, but instead reside at certain anatomical sites. The B\u20101 B cells form an early lineage that already develops in neonatal life and shows a restricted repertoire of its V genes biased to recognize T\u2010independent antigens. B\u20101 B cells are mainly found in the peritoneal cavity and along mucosal surfaces (Bendelac et al., 2001). MZ B cells develop later in life and are also characterized by a restricted repertoire and a fixed position. It is now well established that in addition to negative selection of B cells with the B cell receptor (BCR) reacting strongly with self (Rolink and Melchers, 1996), B cells are also subjected to positive selection during their development based on interactions of their BCR, whereby the affinity of the receptor, accessory signaling molecules, and the nature of the antigen itself play a role (Lopes\u2010Carvalho and Kearney, 2004). It is becoming clear that the signaling through the BCR is an important cell\u2010fate decision step in the differentiation of MZ B cells (Pillai et al., 2005), whereby interaction with self\u2010ligands plays an important role in their recruitment and selection (Dammers 2005, Wen 2005). Positive selection, based on the very nature of the antigen, was very nicely demonstrated by Martin and Kearney, using mice transgenic for different Ig heavy chains. They showed clearly that the ability to become an MZ B cell, based on both phenotypic characteristics and localization, was dependent on the composition of the Ig molecule (Martin and Kearney, 2000). This means that the distinct subsets of B cells, B\u20101 cells, MZ B cells, and follicular B cells, not only occupy different domains of the immune system, but do so with different specificities, evolved to deal with antigens that are most likely encountered at their sites.",

These cells develop into T2 cells, which need additional survival signals such as BAFF (B cell\u2010activating factor of the TNF family). These T2 cells will give rise to both follicular and marginal zone B cells, whereby intermediate precursor stages are discerned based on expression of various markers (Fig. 2\n). The existence of a separate CD23+ CD21/35high precursor cell for MZ B cells was suggested (Loder et al., 1999). Cells with this phenotype are found only in spleen and not in bone marrow, blood, or lymph nodes, and are absent in mice that lack MZ B cells such as Aiolos null mice and Notch2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Because of their absence in Aiolos null mice, they are thought to be different from precursors for follicular B cells, since the development of the latter is normal in these mice (Cariappa 2001, Saito 2003, Loder 1999). Other investigators support the idea that these CD23+ CD21/35high cells are transitional cells that develop from mature follicular B cells (Allman 2004, Srivastava 2005) (Fig. 2). This is based on observations using lymphopenic mice in which follicular B cells were transferred and gave rise to marginal zone B cells.",

In models proposed to explain the two pathways, a major difference emerges: the difference in signaling strength of the BCR needed to develop the two cell types. MZ B cell development requires weak BCR signaling, whereas intermediate signaling is required for follicular B cells. Important data to support this came from studies in Aiolos null mice. As a zinc\u2010finger protein of the Ikaros family, Aiolos is mainly expressed in B cells, and functions to repress target genes. When Aiolos is absent, the strength of BCR signaling increases as seen by enhanced B cell proliferation upon BCR crosslinking, leading to expanded numbers of follicular B cells, but MZ B cells do not develop (Wang et al., 1998). This was related to the fact that Aiolos negatively influences Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) activity (Cariappa et al., 2001). Btk is a member of the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and plays a vital role in many cellular processes. Mutations in the Btk gene cause the primary immunodeficiency disease X\u2010linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans and X\u2010linked immunodeficiency (Xid) in mice (Lindvall et al., 2005). In Xid mice and Btk null mice, follicular B cells are strongly reduced in numbers, but MZ B cells are generated, although in smaller numbers (Kraal 1988a, Loder 1999). In the absence of both Aiolos and Btk, Cariappa et al. (2001) showed that MZ B cells do develop, indicating that Btk is a negative regulator of MZ B cell development, supportive of the idea that MZ B cells require low signal strength through their BCR to differentiate. In contrast, indications that strong BCR signaling, especially from low\u2010dose self\u2010antigens, is essential for MZ B cell maturation have recently been given using a monoclonal BCR mouse (Wen et al., 2005). It is becoming clear that the decision steps for lineage commitment depend on many factors, partly BCR related, and are strongly influenced by environmental factors. Also signaling in B cells via the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, and in p50 component in particular, is required for the proper development of MZ B cells (Cariappa et al., 2000), but this pathway does not seem to interact directly with Btk activation or to influence the signaling strength of the BCR.",

Notch signaling is important for many cell\u2010fate decision steps during ontogenetic development, but also during adult life. Furthermore, it has been suggested that there is an inverse relationship of BCR and Notch signaling, whereby strong BCR signals could downregulate the Notch pathway by induction of inhibitors or downregulation of activating factors (Pillai et al., 2004). Notch2 belongs to the group of four notch receptors described in mammals, which are composed of two noncovalently linked fragments in the cell membrane. Ligation induces the release and translocation into the nucleus of the intracellular domain of Notch (Notch IC), where it interacts with transcriptional repressors such as RBP\u2010J (repressor recombination binding protein\u2010J) to convert it into a transcriptional activator. Recent studies with mice targeted in several genes of the Notch pathways have revealed the role of this signaling route in MZ B cell development. It was first demonstrated that RBP\u2010J was crucial for the proper development of MZ B cells (Tanigaki et al., 2002), followed by the observations that Notch2 was specifically expressed in MZ B cells, and not in follicular B cells, coinciding with an absence of MZ B cells in Notch2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Saito et al., 2003). In addition, transfer of fetal liver cells from MINT\u2212/\u2212 mice into RAG\u2212/\u2212 mice led to the preferential development of MZ B cells (Kuroda et al., 2003). MINT (Msx2\u2010interacting nuclear target protein) negatively regulates activation through Notch by interfering with the interaction of Notch IC and RBP\u2010J. MINT is highly expressed in follicular B cells, consistent with suppression of Notch\u2010regulated genes (Kuroda et al., 2003).",

The E2A gene encodes for two proteins, E12 and E47, which are formed by alternative splicing, and these E proteins are involved in the early commitment and survival of lymphoid precursors into the B cell lineage (Lazorchak et al., 2005). E2A+/\u2212 mice show an increase in levels of MZ B cells, whereas follicular B cell numbers decrease. In Id3 null mice more follicular B cells are generated (Quong et al., 2004). A relationship with Notch signaling was proposed by the authors as it has been demonstrated that the Notch pathway negatively regulates E47 activity (Nie et al., 2003). By controlling the levels of E47, Notch may regulate the cell\u2010fate decision that leads to MZ B cells. Id3 levels, on the other hand, are controlled by Pyk\u20102 kinase activity, corresponding to the fact that in the absence of this kinase no MZ B cells can be formed (Guinamard et al., 2000). A complex picture of signaling pathways that are necessary for the development of MZ B cells versus follicular B cells slowly starts to emerge, but the unraveling of the precise interactions of these routes awaits further studies (Fig. 3\n).",

Delta\u2010like\u20101 (Dl\u20101) is involved as a molecular ligand, since genetic ablation of Dl\u20101 also leads to significant loss of MZ B cells.

By in vivo infusion of an antibody against the MARCO scavenger receptor on marginal zone macrophages it was found that MZ B cells started to migrate out of the MZ and into the follicles (Karlsson et al., 2003). Recently we analyzed MARCO null mice and mice mutated in both MARCO and SR\u2010A\u2010I and found an impairment of the T\u2010independent type 2 (TI\u20102) response in these mice, although no apparent differences in the presence of MZ B cells were found (Chen et al., 2005). The dependence of MZ B cell formation on NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010p50 could point to interactions with microbial antigens encountered in the marginal zone and their signaling through TLR via the NF\u2010\u03baB route. Together it is clear that the formation of MZ B cells is a complex process involving delicate balances in signaling pathways of both BCR and accessory molecules, through interactions with antigen, but also ligands produced by local cells in the marginal zone.",

            "text": "One of the most obvious outcomes of the complex differentiation schemes that lead to marginal zone B cells is the fact that they occupy a different niche and do not recirculate, as compared to follicular B cells. It is not clear whether the development of marginal zone B cells initially starts in the marginal zone or whether their retention is a result of this differentiation. At any rate, some of the molecular bases of why they remain localized are becoming more clear. An important breakthrough was derived from studies using the drug FTY720, which was found to have a major impact on lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs (Cyster, 2005). Upon injection the drug becomes readily phosphorylated, thereby mimicking sphingosine\u20101\u2010phosphate (S1P), and can engage four of the five known S1P receptors. S1P is a lysophospholipid, produced by many cells, including macrophages, and is found in high concentrations in blood compared to lymph. This concentration gradient from lymph to blood may be a driving force for lymphocytes to exit from lymph node upon expression of S1P receptors. Being G\u2010protein coupled receptors they transduce signals upon binding to the lysophospholipids by association with G proteins, leading to a variety of downstream events, including survival signals as well as cell motility. The receptor S1P1 is the most important S1P receptor associated with lymphocyte egress, as inferred from transfer studies with cells from S1P1\u2010deficient mice. S1P1 on lymphocytes is downregulated and inactivated by the FTY720 drug, leading to the inability of cells to exit lymphoid organs (Matloubian et al., 2004). Marginal zone B cells express high levels of S1P1, which turned out to be important for the retention of the cells. Not only did treatment of mice with FTY720 lead to a rapid displacement of MZ B cells from marginal zones into the white pulp follicles, but in S1P1\u2010deficient mice marginal zones were absent (Cinamon et al., 2004). Interestingly, normal numbers of B cells with the MZ B phenotype were found in their spleen, although the mice lacked a clearly localized population of MZ B cells, suggesting that the development of these cells may precede the lodging into their anatomical localization (Cinamon et al., 2004).",

This apparent discrepancy may be explained by higher concentrations of S1P in the blood, to which the cells in the marginal zone are continuously exposed, leading to signaling cascades that favor retention over migration. Effects of S1P on cytoskeleton rearrangements and adhesion have been described in other systems (Rosen and Goetzl, 2005), and a role for integrins and additional chemokines in MZ B cell retention has been given (Lu and Cyster, 2002). In this respect the selective expression of CD9 on MZ B cells deserves attention. CD9 belongs to the family of tetraspanin molecules that associates with signaling receptors on the plasma membrane of leukocytes, thereby forming so\u2010called microdomains, which are thought to facilitate the signaling processes on leukocyte membranes (Wright et al., 2004). CD9, in particular, is associated with integrin molecules (Shaw et al., 1995), and its more or less restricted expression on marginal zone B cells, as well as on B\u20101 B cells and plasma cells, both of which are nonrecirculating cells, may imply a role in the adhesion and sessile nature of these cell types (Fig. 4\n).",

            "text": "In addition, S1P1 may be involved in survival of the marginal zone B cells, because it is well established that the intracellular signaling cascades initiated by S1P can result in antiapoptotic survival signals (Rosen and Goetzl, 2005), and MZ B cells as a population are long\u2013living cells (Hao 2001, Pillai 2004). This involvement of S1P1 is not absolute, and other signaling pathways will also account for their survival, because MZ B cells are still present in S1P1\u2010deficient mice (Cinamon et al., 2004). Activation with LPS or with cognate interaction overrides S1P\u2010mediated retention and leads to immigration of the MZ B cells into the follicles of the spleen (Groeneveld et al., 1985). This immigration is dependent on the chemokine CXCL13. However, when this chemokine is absent, S1P1 is no longer required to keep the B cells in the marginal zone, showing a hierarchy of responsiveness (Cinamon et al., 2004). Expression of S1P1 on MZB cells was shown to be required to overcome the chemotactic response toward CXCL13, which is expressed in the B cell follicles. By triggering of S1P1, B cells either fail to respond to CXCL13, or are induced to express adhesion molecules or other receptors required for retention in the marginal zone (Fig. 4). As such, expression of the integrins LFA\u20101 (\u03b1L\u03b22) and \u03b14\u03b21 has been implicated as adhesion molecules required for retention of MZB cells in this compartment (Lu and Cyster, 2002). Data from gene\u2010targeted mice displaying defects in integrin and chemokine signaling support these findings. DOCK2\u2212/\u2212 mice, which were shown to have a selective defect in chemokine\u2010induced integrin activation (Nombela\u2010Arrieta et al., 2004), have no MZ B cells. This could be attributed to the inability of lymphocytes to activate Rac, required for actin polymerization, which is in turn necessary for migration (Fukui et al., 2001). A strong reduction of MZ B cells was found in the absence of Lsc, which acts downstream of the chemokine receptors in polymerization of actin (Girkontaite et al., 2001). In all these mice, the inability to correctly signal through chemokine or lipid receptors can explain the defect in MZB cell localization.",

Treatment with pertussis toxin leads to the disappearance of the B cells from the marginal zone. Since this toxin acts on G\u03b1 protein signaling, additional chemokines could be involved to retain MZ B cells (Guinamard et al., 2000). However, pertussis toxin treatment will also lead to the disappearance of macrophages from the marginal zone, since marginal zone macrophages require the chemokines CCL21 and, to a lesser extent, CCL19 to localize to the marginal zone (Ato et al., 2004). Expression of the scavenger receptor MARCO by marginal zone macrophages was recently described as essential for localization of B cells to the marginal zone, because infusion of antibodies against MARCO led to migration of the B cells into the follicles, suggesting a disruption in the interaction of MZ B cells and macrophages (Karlsson et al., 2003) (Fig. 5\n).",

This means that most, if not all, of the lymphoid and myeloid cells found in the white pulp enter and leave this region through the marginal zone. The fact that no red blood cells and almost no granulocytes can be found in the white pulp points to an active selection process, and suggests a role for chemokines (Fig. 1D). This was indeed demonstrated using pertussis toxin, which blocks chemokine receptor\u2010associated G\u03b11 protein signaling and led to a blockade of the entry of lymphocytes into the white pulp (Cyster and Goodnow, 1995). The chemokines involved in the localization of the T\u2010 and B\u2010lymphocytes into their respective white pulp compartments were similar to those in lymph node homing: CCR7\u2013CCL19/CCL21 interactions are necessary for the localization of T cells in the white pulp T cell zone, and cooperation between CCR7 and CXCR5 and their ligands is required for B cell entry into the follicles (Muller et al., 2003). Whether chemokine receptor triggering is also essential for the initial activation of lymphocytes in the marginal zone is not formally proven.",

Initial rolling to ligands for L\u2010selectin or integrins on high endothelial venules is followed by chemokine\u2010triggered activation and firm adhesion of the cell onto the endothelial wall by interactions of integrins and integrin receptors. Important integrins that play a role in the adhesion and diapedesis are LFA\u20101(CD11a/CD18), \u03b14\u03b21, and \u03b14\u03b27. In the spleen, however, L\u2010selectin was not found to be important, as inferred from experiments in which trypsin was used to remove this important rolling ligand from lymphocytes, nor did LFA\u20101 seem to play a major role based on studies with LFA\u20101\u2212/\u2212 mice (Nolte et al., 2002). In later studies, using blocking antibodies in transfer experiments, LFA\u20101 interaction did seem to be important, especially in combination with \u03b14\u03b21 (Lo et al., 2003). As counterreceptors, both ICAM\u20101 and VCAM\u20101 were required, but, because a complete blockade of the immigration could never be found using mixtures of antibodies against LFA\u20101 and \u03b14\u03b21 and their counterreceptors, other ligands, such as fibronectin, may be involved (Lo et al., 2003).",

            "text": "An obvious molecular candidate that is supposed to play an important role in the immigration process of cells from marginal zone into white pulp is MAdCAM\u20101 (see Fig. 1). Originally described as an integrin ligand on high endothelial venules in lymphoid organs at mucosal sites, such as mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, it is expressed on sinus\u2010lining cells of the marginal zone, right at the border of the white pulp (Kraal et al., 1995). Several attempts to link this suggestive expression at such a strategic position to a functional role in cell migration using classic antibody interference approaches have so far not led to any results (Kraal et al., 1995; Lo et al., 2003; Nolte et al., 2002). Nevertheless, indirect evidence for a role of MAdCAM\u20101 comes from two sources (Girkontaite 2004, Pabst 2000). First, targeted disruption of NKX2.3, a transcription factor important for tissue differentiation, led to the finding that this factor was essential for the expression of MAdCAM\u20101 in the spleen, and that this expression was not only necessary for the proper structure of the splenic marginal zone, but was also required for cell migration based on the diminished size of the spleen (Pabst et al., 2000). However, the NKX gene also affected the position of marginal metallophilic macrophages, and may therefore have more profound effects than can be ascribed to the lack of MAdCAM\u20101 only. The second indication for a role of MAdCAM\u20101 comes from a study on the S1P3 receptor (Girkontaite et al., 2004). We previously showed that S1P is an important ligand in the retention of MZ B cells by interactions with its receptors S1P1 and S1P3 (Cinamon et al., 2004).",

Again, it cannot be ruled out that additional effects on the overall structure of the spleen are more important, and that the effects on MAdCAM\u20101 are secondary and not indicative of its precise function in the spleen.",

This is related to the efficient capturing of these antigens, many of them bacterial capsular polysaccharides, by the macrophages in the marginal zone and the role of MZ B cells in producing antibodies against them. Splenectomy results in increased susceptibility against encapsulated bacteria, and vaccination against these pathogens before the age of two is difficult, probably because the marginal zone is not yet well developed (Cowan 1978, Likhite 1976). The important role of marginal zone B cells became clear from experiments in various mice with gene deficiencies correlating a defect in MZ B cell development with a concomitant inability to handle gram\u2010negative bacteria or their TI\u20102 antigens (Cariappa 2000, Guinamard 2000, Tanigaki 2002). Their rapid maturation into plasmablasts upon antigen encounter is partly due to their BCR, which can respond more strongly, and probably also to the presence of TLRs on their surface that will help in the recognition of the bacterial antigens, leading to additional intracellular signaling and maturation of the cell. Also CD21, the complement receptor, which is highly expressed on MZ B cells, may aid in concentrating complement\u2010coated polysaccharides (Guinamard 2000, Martin 2001). Although the MZ B cells are independent of T help for the production of IgM antibodies in the initial responses, they do interact and need dendritic cells for their stimulation. Dendritic cells in the marginal zone provide factors such as BAFF and APRIL that will sustain the MZ B cell population and are involved in the generation of T\u2010independent responses. This interaction is thought to replace the CD40 ligand\u2212CD40 interaction between Th and B cells during B cell activation (Balazs 2002, Litinskiy 2002).",

The majority of these tolerogenic responses do not lead to any involvement of the spleen (Samsom 2005, Unger 2003), with the exception of immune responses that are generated in the eye (Camelo 2005, Stein\u2010Streilein 2002). Antigen introduced into the anterior chamber of the eye is carried to the marginal zone by a subset of macrophages, expressing the F4/80 antigen, and leads to the induction of CD8 T cells that can suppress the immune response against the antigen. This anterior chamber\u2010associated immune deviation (ACAID) model is clearly dependent on the marginal zone of the spleen, whereby the F4/80 molecule plays a crucial role (Lin et al., 2005). Whether this involvement of the marginal zone is typical for eye\u2010associated tolerance or whether the induction of CD8 suppressor cells is a general function of the marginal zone is an interesting question that needs further investigation.",

In the following days the spleen increases in size because of expanding centers of myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis (Metcalf 1971, Sasaki 1988). The first macrophages that carry the F4/80 antigen, characteristic of the macrophages in the red pulp, can be detected from dE15, while a subset of Siglec\u20101 (sialoadhesin)\u2010positive macrophages appears between dE18 and birth (Morris 1991, Morris 1992). At this time there is no apparent organization of the macrophage populations. Only in the late phase of splenic development can lymphocytes be found, and the first mature IgM+ B cells are present at dE17, although their precursors can be isolated from the spleen as early as dE13.5 (Godin 1999, Velardi 1984). In rodents the first mature T cells leave the thymus in large numbers only after birth, leading to the subsequent development of separate splenic compartments from that time on (Friedberg 1974, Metcalf 1971, Rugh 1968).",

These lineage\u2010restricted progenitors have been well characterized in early lymph nodes and have the potential to differentiate to antigen\u2010presenting cells, NK cells, and follicular cells, but not to T or B cells (Mebius 1996, Mebius 1997). Importantly, they are crucial for the development of several lymphoid organs such as nasal\u2010associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), Peyer's patches (PP), and lymph nodes (Eberl 2004, Finke 2002, Fukuyama 2002) by giving instructive signals to stromal cells in the organ anlagen that lead to further differentiation (Mebius et al., 1997). This has been well documented using mice deficient in genes of the TNF or NF\u2010\u03baB superfamilies. Interestingly, so far none of these defects, which in some cases can lead to complete absence of any lymph node, affects the initial formation of the spleen, although developmental aberrations are found (see below). This means that the formation of the spleen is regulated by early developmental genes and differs from the development of other secondary lymphoid organs.",

            "text": "Again, with the help of genetically altered mice some of the molecular interactions that are intrinsic to the formation of the spleen have been identified. A mesodermal\u2010derived cell layer, the splanchnic mesodermal plate (SMP), which is part of asymmetric left\u2013right morphogenic development, can be viewed as an organizing center for the development of the spleen. When the SMP is not formed, as in mice lacking the dominant hemimelia (Dh) gene or the homeobox transcription factor Bapx1, no spleen is formed (Green 1967, Hecksher\u2010Sorensen 2004, Lettice 1999, Tribioli 1999). In mice that are deficient in the homeobox gene Hox11 the anlage of the spleen begins normally at dE11.5, but is rapidly followed by resorption due to apoptosis (Dear et al., 1995) or persists as an unorganized rudiment (Kanzler and Dear, 2001). In aggregation chimeras generated between Hox11\u2212/\u2212 and normal mice the defect could not be rescued, which indicates that this defect is intrinsic to this cell population and is not due to the inability of the splenic anlage to attract and retain lymphocyte precursors (Kanzler and Dear, 2001). Also, deficiency in the basic helix\u2010loop\u2010helix transcription factor Capsulin (Lu et al., 2000), and the Wilm's tumor gene product Wt1 (Herzer et al., 1999), results in the complete absence of the spleen. Some of these genes may act in concert, whereby Bapx1 and Dh control the development of the SMP. Wt1 and Hox11 are probably regulated independently of each other (Herzer et al., 1999). Future studies will be necessary to uncover the precise molecular interactions that are essential for the development of the spleen.",

From this day on these macrophages start to localize at the interface of the red and white pulp and establish a marginal zone, which is then also populated by marginal zone B cells (Kraal 1988b, Morris 1992, Takeya 1992). Around day 10 the marginal zone attains its full mature appearance, and at this stage marginal zone bridging channels can also be recognized, which represent protrusions of the white pulp area across the marginal zone into the red pulp (Mitchell 1973, Takeya 1992).",

With its close homology to TNF, it is encompassed in the TNF superfamily, and although TNF and LT often work together in signaling networks, sharing receptors, it has become clear that LT has quite a distinct role, especially in the development of the immune system. Two distinct structural forms of LT can be discerned, LT\u03b1 and LT\u03b2, which form trimeric molecules. As a membrane\u2010bound form it can be found as a heterotrimer, either LT\u03b11\u03b22 or LT\u03b12\u03b21, and in in secreted form as a homotrimer, LT\u03b13 (Ruddle 1992, Ware 2005). Homotrimeric forms of both TNF\u2010\u03b1 and LT\u03b1 can bind and activate each of the two defined TNF receptors, TNF\u2010RI (p55) and TNF\u2010RII (p75), while the LT heterotrimers, but not LT\u03b13, interact through the LT\u03b2\u2010R (Fu 1999, Ware 1995).",

In LT\u03b1\u2010deficient mice, T and B cells have no separate areas and are completely intermingled, while LT\u03b2\u2010deficient mice show B cells localized in a ring around a central T cell area (Koni et al., 1997). Compared to LT\u03b2\u2010deficient mice, LT\u03b2\u2010receptor\u2010deficient mice showed an even more severe phenotype, suggesting the involvement of additional ligands. It was found that LIGHT, a closely related trimeric ligand, was responsible (Wang et al., 2002). The introduction of LIGHT as a transgene in LT\u03b1\u2010deficient mice did lead to restoration of most of the defects in the spleen, except for the organization of the marginal zone, emphasizing the importance of LT\u03b1 in the development of this region. The importance of LT for the architecture of the spleen was also evident from studies that used a soluble LT\u03b2\u2010R\u2010Ig fusion protein to block normal LT\u03b1\u03b2/LT\u03b2\u2010R interactions. Injection of this fusion protein as a decoy receptor during embryonic life severely interferes with the formation of the marginal zone and the T and B cell compartments of the white pulp, comparable to the phenotype of LT\u03b2\u2010deficient mice (Ettinger 1996, Rennert 1996). Interestingly, experiments in which adult animals with a functional marginal zone were treated with the LT\u03b2\u2010R\u2010Ig fusion protein showed a disturbed marginal zone and loss of B cell follicles. This clearly indicates that signaling through LT\u03b2\u2010R is not only important for adequate development of normal splenic organization, but also for its maintenance in adult life (Mackay et al., 1997).",

Reduced numbers of marginal zone and metallophilic macrophages are found, while MAdCAM\u20101 expression is completely absent (Matsumoto 1996, Neumann 1996b, Pasparakis 2000). In addition these mice lack splenic follicles and FDCs, although T and B cells are segregated as seen in LT\u03b2\u2010deficient mice (K\u00f6rner 1997, Le Hir 1996, Pasparakis 1996). In contrast, spleens of TNF\u2010RII\u2010deficient mice appear normal, indicating that this receptor is either not important in splenic formation or that its function can be taken over by TNF\u2010RI (Matsumoto 1996, Neumann 1996a, Pasparakis 2000).",

In contrast to the findings with LT\u03b2\u2010R, injections of soluble TNF\u2010RI\u2010Ig in adult mice did not lead to any effects, thus indicating that signaling through this receptor is important only for splenic development, but not for its maintenance (Mackay et al., 1997). Importantly, bone marrow transplantation experiments have revealed that expression of TNF\u2010RI and LT\u03b2\u2010R, required for proper development of the splenic microarchitecture, is necessary on radioresistant stromal cells, while LT\u03b1, LT\u03b2, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 are derived from cells of hematopoietic origin, which are most likely B cells (Endres 1999, Matsumoto 1996, Matsumoto 1997, Mebius 1998, Tkachuk 1998). This could explain why the marginal zone in B cell\u2010deficient mice is not developed, and when B cells are experimentally depleted in adult life, this leads to a disappearance of marginal zone macrophages and the expression of MAdCAM\u20101 (Nolte et al., 2004). LT\u03b2\u2010R or TNF\u2010R triggering leads downstream to the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB. This ubiquitously expressed transcription factor family is involved in numerous cellular responses and serves as a critical regulator of the inducible expression of many genes (de Winther et al., 2005). In mammalian systems, this family is composed of subunits p50, p52, RelA (p65), c\u2010Rel, and RelB, which can all form dimeric complexes, depending on the cell type and activation state (Baeuerle 1994, Ghosh 1998, Mercurio 1999). These dimers exist in the cytoplasm in an inactive form, due to interaction with inhibitory proteins termed I\u03baBs. Upon activating signals, these I\u03baBs are phosphorylated and consequently degraded, which results in nuclear translocation of the NF\u2010\u03baB dimeric complex and transcription of its target genes (de Winther 2005, Hayden 2004).",

This is the case for mice deficient in NIK, the natural mutant aly/aly mice (Shinkura et al., 1999), which in addition to lacking lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, have no marginal zone (Karrer 1997, Koike 1996, Miyawaki 1994, Yamada 2000). Also, relB expression is absolutely required for the development of the splenic marginal zone (Weih et al., 2001). RelB acts downstream of LT\u03b2\u2010R, and perhaps TNF\u2010R, and is most likely expressed by endothelial and/or stromal cells present in the marginal zone (Weih and Caamano, 2003).",

Compared to our knowledge a decade ago, it is clear that a general picture of what the marginal zone was and how it functioned existed, but little was known about these intricate cellular interactions. It is clear that the marginal zone is a highly dynamic region in which the continuous interaction of the various resident and transmigrating cells is necessary to maintain its active state. In particular, the interaction between macrophages, MZ B cells, and dendritic cells is crucial for the integrity of this region. Through growth factors and hormones and cell\u2013cell contacts, a picture of delicately balanced interactions is emerging, and any perturbance of this balance can have direct consequences for the function of the marginal zone.",

Serial sections of a mouse spleen have been stained with various monoclonal antibodies to reveal the position of the different cell populations in the marginal zone. In all sections the expression of MAdCAM\u20101 (red) on the cells of the marginal sinus is used to clearly indicate the demarcation between white pulp and marginal zone. In addition, MAdCAM\u20101 stains cells, probably follicular dendritic cells in the B cell follicles. In (A) and (B) the marginal zone macrophage population is clearly visible based on its expression of MARCO [(A) green] and SIGNR1 [(B) green]. In (C) the compact ring of sialoadhesin\u2010positive marginal metallophilic macrophages can be seen. In (D) the staining for Ter119 (green) on erythrocyte membranes demonstrates the strict separation of freely passing blood in the marginal zone and the red pulp and the absence of erythrocytes in the white pulp, clearly illustrating the selective barrier that exists for leukocytes to enter the white pulp from the marginal zone. In (E) the localization of dendritic cells, based on the expression of CD11c, in the T cell zone of the white pulp, in a bridging channel [visible in the top of (E)], and in the marginal zone is seen. Finally, in (F) the presence of B cells, most of them belonging to the distinct population of marginal zone B cells, can be seen outside the MAdCAM\u20101\u2010positive sinus. In addition, within the white pulp two B cell follicles (green), separated by the T cell zone, can be seen. Magnification: \u00d710.",

Lymphotoxin\u2013lymphotoxin receptor interaction (LT\u2010LTR) is thought to be necessary for the survival of MZM, possibly through positive effects on integrin\u2010mediated retention.
