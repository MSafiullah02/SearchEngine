Therefore, early detection of infection is the key to early isolation and treatment. Direct detection of the virus itself has advantages over indirect detection. Currently, the most sensitive and commercially validated method for COVID-19 testing is RT-qPCR, designed to detect amplified virus-specific RNA. Reliable testing has proven to be a bottleneck in early diagnosis of virus infection in all countries dealing with the pandemic. Significant performance and quality issues with available testing kits have caused confusion and serious health risks. In order to provide better understanding of the Quality and performance of COVID-19 RNA detection kits on the market, we designed a system to evaluate the specificity (quantitation), sensitivity (LOD) and robustness of the kits using positive RNA and pseudovirus controls based on COVID-19 genomic sequence 3,4 . We evaluated 8 Nucleic Acid qPCR Kits approved in China, some of which are also approved in the US and EU. Our study showed that half of these 8 kits lack 1:1 linear relationship for virus RNA copy: qPCR signal. Of the 4 with linear response, 2 demonstrated sensitivity at 1 Copy viral RNA/Reaction, suitable for early detection of virus infection. Furthermore, we established the best RNA extraction, handling and qPCR procedures allowing highly sensitive and consistent performance using BGI qPCR kits. Our study provides an effective method to assess and compare performance quality of all COVID-19 nucleic acid testing kits, globally.",

Despite of focused efforts from global biomedical industries and regulatory authorities, testing tools currently available on the market are not satisfying the huge and most important needs for virus control, which is specific, sensitive, affordable, and commercially viable early diagnosis of infected populations. We have designed an experimental system to assess and compare all nucleic acid-based COVID-19 testing kits from quality control perspectives. The results reported here demonstrate the suitability of using our system as an objective QC system for all commercial kits, including any future kits.

Recognizing the criticality and need early, the China Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) announced a \"Green Channel\" for reviewing and approving COVID-19 testing kits and other bio-medical interventions such as clinical trial drugs in January 2020. At the time of submission, 23 diagnostic kits have been approved in China, of which 8 are based on quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) using COVID-19 viral RNA sequence as templates and fluorescence detection.

However, significant technical and performance quality issues with these testing kits have become evident. In China, the reliability of detecting COVID-19 using approved qPCR methods have been reported by first line healthcare professionals to range from 35-50% 8 . This situation resulted in the initial under-reporting of COVID-19 infected cases in China, which in turn triggered the change of diagnostic criteria by China CDC on Feb 11 from solely the RNA test result to relying on a combination of clinical symptoms including lung CT scan and RNA test 9 . These issues are now becoming evident in the pandemic management in the world. Continued global spread of the epidemic highlights the continual and present demand for sensitive and reliable virus detection without exception, including countries considered as leading bio-medical countries (i.e. EU nations and the US). Notably, the initial failure in quality virus testing kits distributed by US CDC is viewed as a critical mistake in the management of the crises by the US government resulting in compromised ability to test and trace the earlier infected population clusters before they spread to wider populations through community contacts. The failure in providing a sufficient amount of reliable quality testing tools has since been identified as a critical factor in the rapid spread of the virus in many parts of the world which is paralyzing healthcare systems and claiming hundreds of thousands of lives so far.",

            "text": "In Vitro Diagnostic kits (IVD) are usually approved by regulatory authorities around the world under the category of medical devices. Commercialization of IVDs typically requires 3-5 years of product development, followed by a 1 to 2-year regulatory review period. Evaluation criteria include scientific rationale, technical considerations, product quality and safety, and consistency of performance for the intended purpose and markets including manufacturing capability (supply). The COVID-19 RNA kits approved under EUA had much shorter time for development and regulatory review, in some cases resulting in higher variability and quality issues. These issues often resulted in delays in diagnosis requiring repetitive testing using different testing kits and methods in order to confirm a positive infection as a result of the high rate of \"False Negatives\" observed in many of the approved testing kits. IVD industry leaders (i.e. Roche Diagnostics) are equally affected, although having one of the first COVID-19 IVD approved by the US FDA under EUA, the determined sensitivity, when compared head-to-head with other kits in our study, did not achieve single copy/reaction detectability. ROCHE reagents used in Cobas-SARS-CoV-2 10 achieved quantitative detection of the viral RNA, consistent with product claim (LOD of 10 copies/reaction) and confirmed in our study (data not shown), while both BGI and Sansure kits demonstrated LODs at 1 copy/reaction. Therefore, the existing RNA testing tools world-wide are at best insufficient in providing consistent performance suitable for reliable early detection and proper isolation, a key-criteria central to the control of the pandemic before an effective vaccine or treatment is available. In addition, lack of reliable correlation of clinical treatment with viral load could also affect decisions on treatment and post-recovery patient management.",

Using this approach, all COVID-19 RNA detection kits can be compared with the currently approved kits to aid the decision in regulatory approval as well as clinical applications. Use of the E, N genes and ORF1a/b region of the virus genome as RNA based assay and internal controls in our study takes into consideration that these represent the most likely regions (coding for structural and nonstructural proteins, including those essential to virus functions) for Primer and Probe design 11 . This study design is viable for comparing and screening all new COVID-19 virus detecting reagents in the world to provide objective evaluation of the performance and quality of the new IVD tools.",

Coincidentally, BGI Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR kit from China is the only one of its kind to have obtained US FDA and EMA emergency approval so far 12, 13 . The Quality Control strategy and reliable performance by Jade Biomedical Laboratories demonstrated in this study will continue to allow contribution to the global need for more reliable and easily accessible COVID-19 testing. Direct clinical validation of our BTS is currently being planned in order to help with the on-going global clinical treatment strategy and intervention development by providing such specific, sensitive, and reliable viral load testing.",
