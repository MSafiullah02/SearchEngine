            "text": "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive peripheral T-lymphocytic malignancy mediated by the Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) [1], [2]. The disease occurs almost exclusively in areas where the virus is endemic where approximately 6\u201337% of the population is infected [3]. Evidence from clinical studies suggests that fewer than 5% of infected individuals develop ATLL, usually after decades of relatively symptom-free infection. The clinical and prognostic diversity of patients has led to its subclassification such as acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. Over two-thirds of patients present with leukemia (leukemia form), while approximately 25% have no blood involvement (lymphoma form). Noteworthy, unlike most leukemias, bone marrow infiltration is not always present in ATLL. The usefulness of clinical subclassification may be limited due to the heterogeneity of genomic abnormalities within the host genome, which may account for further diversities within clinical subgroups [4], [5], [6], [7]. We present here detailed cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) findings in an ATLL patient, the first reported case from Kuwait. Our case may be of interest due to: (1) rare occurrence of ATLL in this region, (2) detailed genomic findings in a patient and (3) correlation of genomic findings with clinical course, the first described from this region.",

At presentation, physical examination was normal and abdominal ultrasound showed no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Chest X-ray and computerized tomography showed bilaterally ill defined opacities with fibrosis and bilateral bronchiectatic changes. Serum chemistry profile was normal, except raised lactate dehydrogenase, which was more than twice (399 U/L) the upper limit of the normal range (190). Serum calcium level was normal on repeated occasions. Collagen work up, thyroid function and tuberculosis tests were negative.

The peripheral blood smear showed a polymorphous population of atypical lymphocytes with high N/C ratio of polylobulated and irregular nuclear borders described as clover leaf cells (ATLL cells). The cytoplasm was deeply basophilic with occasional vacuoles. Bone marrow aspirate was moderately hypercellular with diffuse infiltration of lymphoid elements (23%) and similar morphology as in the peripheral blood (Fig. 1\n). Flow cytometry of the bone marrow biopsy was tested positive for CD2 (83%), CD3 (78%), CD4 (79%), CD38 (89%), CD45 (96%), CD25 (45%) and CD38 (89%), whereas immunophenotype results from the blood were: CD2 (80%), CD3 (81%), CD4 (78%), CD38 (81%), CD45 (99%), CD25 (85%) and CD38 (81%). The expression of CD5 was reduced (29% in bone marrow and 41% in blood sample). CD7 and CD8 were negative both in bone marrow and blood samples. Based on clinical and laboratory findings the co-existence of Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type-1 serology was sought, and was positive, giving a diagnosis of HTLV-1-induced adult T-cell leukemia/lyphoma (ATLL).",

Once hospitalized, the course of her disease was very acute and severe, as is seen in acute disease. She was started on interferon alpha, broad spectrum antibiotics and anti-retroviral therapy with Tazocin, Erythromycin and Septrin and as well as with Diflucan and Claxene. The patient developed rapidly progressive dyspnea with respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, for what she was kept on mechanical ventilation. While on ventilation, bilateral surgical emphesema were noticed and chest X-ray showed bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. The patient developed fever and persistant tachycardia, out of proportion to fever. The patient continued on sensitive antibiotics; however cultures and sensitivity tests revealed gram-negative and gram-positive bacteraemia (coagulase-negative staphylococci, pseudomonas and klebsilla pneumoniae) and Candida Dubleninesis. Her general condition did not improve and hemoglobin dropped despite being a febrile with no evidence of blood loss. The patient developed hypotension and progressed to slow bradycardia. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she died shortly afterwards due to cardiac arrest.",

In the sideline karyotypes further anomalies such as abnormalities of 3q, 7p, 12p, 14q, 17q, abnormality of chromosome 19 were observed indicating these anomalies may be additional changes reflecting disease evolution. In the peripheral blood cultures only 3 normal metaphases were detected and the remaining metaphases displayed multiple numerical anomalies such as monosomy 13 and additional 18, hypotetraploidy as well as multiple structural anomalies. Among them, chromosome 3, 7q and 11q abnormalities, del(14)(q11q13), an additional isochromosome 18 and monosomy 13 were observed in the majority of examined metaphases.

            "text": "Adult T-cell leukemia is one of the most aggressive human neoplasias and one of the few examples in which the primary etiologic agent, the human retrovirus HTLV-1 has been established [9], [10]. HTLV-1 integrates into random sites in host chromosomal DNA, inducing genomic instability by interfering with mitotic checkpoints and reduced DNA repair [11], [12]. The transformation is initiated by Tax, a regulatory protein encoded by the HTLV-I pX region [13]. This viral oncoprotein interacts with numerous cellular processes including transcription, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis resulting in a state of genomic instability, which is thought to be a major contributor to the development of ATLL [14], [15], [16]. The presence of a variety and extensive forms of genomic aberrations observed in leukemic cells of our patient is compatible with this concept. A number of breaks and multiple numerical rearrangements were observed including aneuploidy, hypotetraploidy, derivative chromosomes, balanced and unbalanced translocations, deletions, complicated by a plethora of additional abnormalities.",

The TCRA/D gene is located at 14q11; however its involvement has not been confirmed in ATLL [21]. Moreover, the deletion of chromosomal 14q11-13 region observed in our patient is a known karyotypic anomaly in ATLL, suggesting location of tumor suppressor gene(s) in this region. Several deletion abnormalities and alterations of several known tumor suppressor genes have been found in ATLL [22], [23]. Chromosome 13 abnormalities involving the retinoblastoma gene and their association with structural abnormalities of 7q chromosomes as it was found in our patient have been reported to occur in ATLL. Chromosome 3 anomalies and isochromosome of 18q found in the majority of clones in our patient are known anomalies in T-cell malignancy including ATLL.

            "text": "Another important characteristic of HTLV-I is its restricted geographic prevalence. Until the beginning of the 1990s, the Middle East has been considered as a region virtually free from HTLV-I infection. Later it has been shown; that a relatively high prevalence of HTLV-1 infection can be found in Iran and the region of Mashhad has been recognized as an endemic area of the virus. Subsequent studies confirmed, that a relatively high prevalence of HTLV-I infection can be detected in Israel, confined almost exclusively to the immigrants from Mashhad, in so-called Mashhadi Jews. Then it has been shown that the high prevalence of HTLV-I infection is also characteristic for the Muslim population of Mashhad and for additional regions in Iran [25], [26]. A low prevalence and sporadic cases of HTLV-I has been described in Iraq and, more recently, in Kuwait [26], [27], [28]. The family roots in three described Kuwaiti patients were located to Iraq in Najaf, which population had historically strong ties with the Mashdad region of Iran. Molecular characterization of HTLV-1 found revealed close similarity with HTLV-1 isolates originating from Mashhad in these Kuwaiti patients, suggesting the common origin of Kuwaiti (Najafi) and Mashhadi HTLV-1 infection [26], [27]. In addition, a relatively high prevalence of HTLV-1 infection (1:4648) was found among volunteer blood donors in Kuwait [28]. The infection was more prevalent among non-Kuwaiti Arab donors (Indians and Iranians) than among Kuwaiti nationals (1:3782 vs. 1:6379). These findings indicate that HTLV-I infection is quite prevalent among blood donors in Kuwait, raising the possibility of another pocket of HTLV-1 infection in the Middle East.",

The occurrence of chromosomally unstable clones or single cell abnormalities in our patient may constitute steps in the genesis and progression of the disease. To characterize these breakpoints may be helpful in identifying the responsible genes in the stepwise process of ATLL carcinogenesis. Our findings confirmed that genomic instability, which is thought to be a major contributor to the HTLV-1 associated ATLL, clearly correlated with karyotypic complexity and poor prognosis [29]. To our knowledge the present case is the first reported of ATLL from Kuwait in which these features are associated with HTLV-1 infection.",
