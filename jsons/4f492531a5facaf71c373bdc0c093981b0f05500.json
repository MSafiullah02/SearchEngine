Besides TPC2, Nar is also an inhibitor of TPC1 activity with an IC50 of about 500 \u00b5M therefore larger than for TPC2 (about 200 \u00b5M) (Pafumi et al., 2017) .",

As a matter of fact, chloroquine acts as a weak base and accumulates in the lysosomes quenching their acidic pH, thereby halting autophagic degradative flux (Homewood et al., 1972) . In line with this evidence, interestingly, it has been found that loss of TPC2 leads to an increase in melanosome/lysosome pH (Cang et al., 2013; Ambrosio et al., 2016; Bellono et al., 2016) . In fact, TPC2 was shown to be involved in the control of human melanosome luminal pH: actually in TPC2-KO human melanotic MNT-1 cells, and in primary melanocytes subjected to TPC2 knockout by the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, the lumen of melanosomes is more alkaline than in control cells (Ambrosio et al., 2016) . Bellono et al. (2016) also hypothesized that TPC2 can regulate melanosome pH producing a cation counterflux to enhance V-ATPase H + transport into the melanosome lumen, consistent with the requirement for an inward cation current in lysosomal acidification (Steinberg et al., 2010) . In addition, Cang et al. (2013) demonstrated a shift toward alkalinization in TPC2 \u2212/\u2212 macrophage lysosomes after starvation.",

            "text": "Since viral replication takes place in specific cellular compartments induced by viral proteins which modify cell organelles to create sites for replication, hidden from innate immunity, membrane fusion mechanisms are crucial events in the infection process. To this purpose, the virus S protein consists of two subunits, S1 and S2, with S1 providing the receptor binding function through the entry receptor ACE2 and S2 providing fusion activity. Interestingly, the subunits are cleaved from the complete S by host cell proteases (cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L, furin proteases and cellular serine protease TMPRSS2) and, following receptor binding by S1, the fusion mechanism of S2 acts to bring the viral and cellular vesicles membranes into such close proximity that fusion occurs (reviewed in Alsaadi and Jones, 2019) . In this context, it should be noted that the opening of TPCs induces a strong sodiumdriven depolarization in the endo-lysosomal membrane (Wang et al., 2012; Boccaccio et al., 2014; Cang et al., 2014; Lagostena et al., 2017) , which is supposed to enhance membrane fusion mechanisms (Wang et al., 2012) . In line with this hypothesis, COS-1 cells transfected with human TPC2 have larger lysosomes than cells transfected with a non-functional form of the channel. Moreover, it was recently shown (Freeman et al., 2020) that TPCs are directly involved in sodium efflux, which, in parallel with chloride movement, regulates osmolyte release in endocytic vacuoles, with significant modification of vacuolar surface-tovolume ratio. Therefore, inhibition of TPCs should both impair the fusogenic potential of the endo-lysosomal system and alter the normal trafficking, which, in turn, could be a limit for viral replication (Alsaadi and Jones, 2019) . Very recently, unique features of TPC2 in the response to different agonists have been published (Gerndt et al., 2020) expanding the characterization of this channel, hence the range of potential approaches to pharmacologically control the intracellular pathway of the virus.",

            "text": "The use of Nar, one of the main flavonoids present in the human diet, as a specific inhibitor of TPCs (Benkerrou et al., 2019) has several advantages. Nar is a hydrophobic molecule able to cross biological membranes and to reach the intracellular compartments (endosomes and lysosomes) where TPCs are localized. The toxicity of Nar is low: concentrations greater than 1 mM do not affect human hepatocytes viability (Nahmias et al., 2008) and, in mice, doses up to 1,500 mg/kg given by intraperitoneal injection did not induce marked elevation of liver enzymes or cause animal death (Nahmias et al., 2008) . Interestingly, in the same study (Nahmias et al., 2008) , Nar was shown to be effective to reduce Hepatitis C virus secretion by 80% when added at 200 \u00b5M in infected Huh7.5.1 human hepatoma cell line. Moreover, that Nar treatment could be a promising strategy to inhibit virus replication and infection is further confirmed by interesting studies on the influenza A virus, dengue virus and Zika virus (Dong et al., 2015; Frabasile et al., 2017; Cataneo et al., 2019) . Antiviral effect of some flavonoids and Nar through blocking viral proteases activity in different experimental models has been also reported (de Sousa et al., 2015; Lulu et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2017; Jo et al., 2020) . Of note, Nar has been shown to ameliorate acute inflammation (Jin et al., 2017) as well as lung fibrosis , which could represent a therapeutic advantage. In particular, Zeng et al. demonstrated that Nar suppresses inflammatory cytokine production through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (by regulating lysosome function) resulting in the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion by macrophages and T cells (Jin et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2018) . Clinical trials analyzing the therapeutic potential of Nar have been recently reviewed (Salehi et al., 2019) and an important clinical trial on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Nar has just been reported, indicating the strong interest around this compound (Bai et al., 2020) . While this manuscript was under review, an article by Ou et al. (2020) demonstrated that TPC2 is a key player for SARS-CoV-2 entry in 293/hACE2 cells, consistent with our findings and further supporting our hypothesis.",
