Every few years, viral pathogens, including various influenza strains, SARS and MERS coronaviruses, Ebola, and most recently Zika virus, have caused considerable personal and economic loss (see \u201cRelevant Websites section\u201d). Identification of causative agents, clinical reporting of infections, and epidemiological surveillance are all critical during these outbreaks. Such efforts to identify the causes of these infectious outbreaks lead to a wealth of information about the viruses and their host. Databases allow storage and analysis of this information to fuel further wet-lab experimentation on the causative agents and comparative analyses of their genomes. Such research efforts are important for predicting, preventing and limiting future outbreaks.",

The significance of such databases is evident in multiple use cases that demonstrate the utility of the resources. For example, data and bioinformatics tools from ViPR and IRD have facilitated research into detection and diagnostics of viral pathogens, prediction of viral hosts and environmental reservoirs, viral evolution, development of vaccines, discovery of genomic determinants of virulence, and anti-viral drug development.

HBVDb allows the analysis of annotated sequences for genotyping and drug resistance profiling. Similarly, a collection of databases for research on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are available (see \u201cRelevant Websites section\u201d) that contain comprehensive data on genome and protein sequences and immunological epitopes. Because influenza virus poses perhaps the most persistent major global public health threat, several databases are dedicated to research on influenza. For instance, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; see \u201cRelevant Websites section\u201d) is an access-controlled resource of influenza sequence information and related epidemiological data. FluNet (See Relevant Websites Section) is a global web-based influenza surveillance data collection, maintained at the World Health Organization (WHO) and available for tracking the movement of flu viruses globally.

With the foresight into the importance of such capabilities, several dedicated webtools are available for the users to conduct various types of analyses on viral genomes. For instance, tools such as IDSeq (see \u201cRelevant Websites section\u201d), Virome (see \u201cRelevant Websites section\u201d) and VirusDetect (see \u201cRelevant Websites section\u201d) allow detection of viruses from deep-sequencing of metagenomics samples. IDSeq is designed with the aim of real-time pathogen detection from metagenomes. Virome focuses on environmental metagenomes, whereas VirusDetect specifically uses small RNA datasets to detect viruses using both de novo and reference-based assemblies. Once a novel virus isolate or variant is detected, tools such as the Viral Genome ORF Reader (VIGOR; see \u201cRelevant Websites section\u201d) enable genome annotation. VIGOR is a homology-driven viral gene prediction program that yields predicted proteins and mature peptides for newly sequenced isolates and variants of human virus. The software uses a set of highly curated databases enabling VIGOR to annotate a given viral genome. Currently VIGOR supports gene prediction and annotation of about 25 different virus taxonomic groups.",

Derived data include improved and consistent metadata annotations including strain name, clade and genotype information, virus taxonomy, host and country of isolation, and collection date. For instance, the ViPR annotation process extends information available in the representative RefSeq strain for each species. The process uses multiple sequence alignment to map homologous regions across related viral genomes to map mature peptide cleavage sites on polyproteins. Likewise, a custom annotation pipeline is used in IRD to predict open reading frames and sequences for variants of influenza proteins including PA-X, PA-N155, PA-N182, M42, NS3 and PB1-40. The predicted variant proteins can be retrieved from the Nucleotide and Protein Sequence Search pages. Various tree-based clade classification tools are also available and have been used to predict clades and genotypes of pathogenic strains of several viruses including Zika, rotaA, and Hepatitis C virus in ViPR and H1N1, H5N1 and swine H1 strains in IRD. Furthermore, Sequence Features (SFs) are derived using information integrated from UniProt, GenBank, IEDB and the scientific literature followed by inspection and validation by domain experts. SFs are protein regions with important structural, functional, immune epitopes, or sequence alteration characteristics. Once the SF protein regions are defined, the extent of sequence variation observed in each region is determined as a series of Variant Types (VTs). Lastly, the Host factor component of IRD/ViPR contains a variety of derived data that gives insights about the systems-level infection dynamics. For instance, host factor biosets are group of genes/proteins/metabolites that are significantly differentially expressed/abundant at different times post infection. Data models derived using Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) are available to aid identification of co-expressed genes that may be functionally related, tightly co-regulated or members of similar pathway. The set of co-expressed genes can also be visualized as Cytoscape networks where nodes represent genes and edges represents the strength of co-expression.",

The highly curated strain level data are displayed with a Genome Map image and a Protein Information table from which detailed structural and functional information for a given gene/protein can be obtained.

Additionally, users can use advanced options to query the database using theoretical structures. Once a particular structure from the search results is selected, users can customize the general appearance of protein structures. For example, users can highlight ligands, active sites, epitopes and sequence features on the 3D structures. Individual residues within the protein structures are mapped to homologous positions from UniProt records, which allows comparison between protein structures. Annotating a 3D structure with important residues and regions of interest can yield testable hypotheses about the functional relevance of the protein. Lastly, users can download the highlighted protein structure as a publication quality image file or a structure movie.",

The H5N1 classification tool uses phylogenetic analysis to classify HA sequences according to the WHO H5 classification scheme. The H5N1 classifier has been verified to have >98% accuracy for sequences of at least 300 nucleotides of HA1. On the other hand, the H1N1 classification tool in IRD is a robust application of BLAST to recognize sequences closely related to pandemic sequences.

The subtypes are represented in the parentheses following the names of the sequences. While the subtypes D8 and B3 are more globally circulating, causing infections across different countries, the subtype H1 is predominantly found in China. Moreover, in a given country, strains belonging to the same subtype have repeatedly caused measles infections over several years indicating pathogen persistence in the population, likely due to imperfect and inadequate vaccination practices.",
