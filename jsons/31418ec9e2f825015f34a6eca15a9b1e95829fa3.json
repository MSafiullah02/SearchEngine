            "text": "Background: Encephalitis is associated with significant neurological disability and mortality. Many guidelines are published for encephalitis management but compliance with them is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the appropriate management and compliance to the current guidelines in adults with encephalitis. Study design: A retrospective multicenter study at 17 hospitals in the Greater Houston area from August 1, 2008 through September 30, 2017. All cases met the definition for possible or probable encephalitis as per the international encephalitis consortium guidelines. Results: A total of 241 adults (age > 17 years) with encephalitis were enrolled. The most common etiologies were unknown (41.9 %), viral (27.8 %) and autoimmune (21.2 %). An adverse clinical outcome was seen in 49 % with 12.4 % in hospital mortality. A high compliance with guidelines (> 90 %) was only seen in obtaining a brain computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) gram stain and culture. A CSF herpes virus simplex (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done in 84 % and only repeated in 14.2 % of patients with an initial negative result. Furthermore, only two-thirds of patients were started empirically on intravenous acyclovir and antibiotics. Evaluation for other etiologies were not uniformly performed: arboviral serologies (57.3 %), CSF anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDA) receptor antibody (35.7 %), and CSF varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR (32 %). The highest yield for the tests were arboviral serologies (42 %), anti-NMDA antibodies (41.2 %) and VZV PCR (16.4 %). Conclusion: The management of encephalitis as per current guidelines is suboptimal leading to underutilization of currently available diagnostic tests and empirical therapy.",

Furthermore, up to two-thirds of survivors from viral encephalitis (Herpes simplex virus, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus) have neurological and/or neurocognitive sequelae [3] [4] [5] . The incidence of encephalitis varies by country between 0.4-16 cases per 100,000 persons [2] . Infections and autoimmune etiologies are considered to be the most important causes of encephalitis representing approximately 40 % and 20 %, respectively when systematically evaluated [1] . However, between 37-80 % of encephalitis cases remain with unknown etiologies [2, [6] [7] [8] . In the past, brain biopsy was the gold standard for diagnostic method for encephalitis but currently it is infrequently done as less invasive and highly sensitive diagnostic tools such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viruses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was introduced [9] . The variability in the proportion of unknown etiologies between studies is most likely driven by the availability and use of molecular diagnostic techniques, and testing for arboviral serologies and autoimmune etiologies [10] .",

As summarized in (Supplemental Digital Content - Table 1 ), all guidelines of encephalitis management have major parts in evaluating and managing patients with encephalitis; exposure evaluation, appropriate utilization of diagnostic and neurodiagnostic studies, and proportion and timing of empirical antibiotic and antiviral therapy [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

As shown in (Table 4) , the compliance to exposure evaluation was the lowest. However, most of exposures and risk factors yielded important information in a substantial proportion of patients highlighting the importance in documenting them. The most common cause of encephalitis was idiopathic which is consistent with most studies [1, 2, 7, 8] . The most common infectious cause of encephalitis in our study was WNV. In the encephalitis study done in England, HSV was the most common cause of infectious encephalitis with no cases of WNV reported [7] . In contrast, WNV is endemic in the US. Furthermore, 27 patients (96.4 %) with WNV encephalitis were diagnosed during the endemic season (between June and October) [10] . Regarding diagnostic tests, most guidelines recommend obtaining HIV test and blood culture in all patients with encephalitis and other diagnostic tests can be done based on clinical clues and epidemiological risk factors [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The compliance rate was favorable in ordering blood culture (92.9 %) but suboptimal in HIV (77.2 %). In terms of neurodiagnostic evaluations, it is recommended by all guidelines to obtain CSF analysis, CSF gram stain and culture, CSF HSV PCR, CSF VZV PCR, CSF Enterovirus PCR, brain imaging which MRI is preferable, and Electroencephalography (EEG). Further neurodiagnostic testing will be based on clinical necessity [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Most of our patients had CSF analysis, CSF gram stain and culture, and brain imaging. EEG was underutilized in our study and was only performed in two third of patients. HSV is the most common treatable cause of encephalitis and the guidelines recommend that all patients should be tested. In our study, a CSF HSV PCR was done in 84.2 %. Additionally, the guidelines advocate to repeat a CSF HSV PCR in undiagnosed cases of encephalitis in which patients have clinical features or radiological findings of HSV encephalitis [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In our study, a repeat CSF HSV PCR was only done in 14.2 % of 148 undiagnosed patients with suspected features of HSV encephalitis. This raises the concern of underdiagnosing the most common treatable etiology. A CSF VZV PCR were not uniformly done but had the highest yield in our study. Additionally, [18] . Although anti-NMDA antibodies were checked only in about 35 % of our population, anti-NMDA antibodies was the most common cause of autoimmune encephalitis in our study. All guidelines in agreement that empiric antibiotics and acyclovir should be started as soon as possible in patients with suspected encephalitis. In our study, empiric intravenous antibiotics and acyclovir were not started in about one third of the patients; this is worrisome as delays in therapy are associated with an increase adverse outcomes in both bacterial meningitis and herpetic encephalitis [4, 13, [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, the median time to initiate intravenous acyclovir was 12 h from arriving to the emergency room. A recent study of 438 patients with herpetic encephalitis documented unfavorable outcomes in 52.9 % of patients with age and Glasgow coma scales as independent prognostic factors [4] . The authors were also able to correlate a delay in the initiation of acyclovir with a linear increase in adverse clinical outcomes and recommended to start antiviral therapy urgently in all patient with suspected encephalitis. The mortality rate in our study was 12.6 %; similar to the 5-15 % rates reported in the literature [1, 14, 22] .",

VZV encephalitis can possibly occur in absence of the typical rash as reported by Halling G. et al. in 2014 and all guidelines recommended to check CSF VZV in all patients with encephalitis regardless of the presence or absence of a rash [17]. In 2009, Gable M.S. et al., recommended to consider autoimmune etiologies including anti-NMDA antibodies in all patient with suspected encephalitis especially if the diagnosis remains unclear",
