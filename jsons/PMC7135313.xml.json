Pathogen testing previously was performed by traditional laboratory methods such as bacterial, fungal, and viral culture or ova and parasite (O&P) examination. Testing could have a slow time to results; some testing lacked sensitivity, and most testing was centralized in the laboratory. Newer advances in pathogen detection assays are now providing rapid results and have greater sensitivity and specificity, and many assays are moving out of the centralized laboratory and to the patient as point-of-care tests. In this review, the authors chose to highlight the currently available US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013cleared molecular assays for various infectious syndromes relevant to the pediatric population. Although outcome studies in this area are sparse, rapid results may result in decreased time to optimal antimicrobial treatment and improved patient outcomes.",

Strep throat is most common in children 5 to 15 years of age, which is complicated by the fact that approximately 15% of children in this group are asymptomatic carriers of GAS.1 Throat culture is the gold standard for diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, but due to the 24- to 48-hour turnaround time, rapid antigen testing has been the standard of practice in emergency departments (EDs) and outpatient clinics for many years. Because rapid antigen assays have low sensitivity compared with culture, throat swabs that test negative by the GAS rapid antigen assay must be cultured when collected from children less than 18 years of age. Rapid antigen testing when combined with reflex throat culture brings the sensitivity of GAS detection to an acceptable level of greater than 95%.",

These new assays are rapid, have increased sensitivity over traditional rapid antigen tests, and in many cases, can be performed at point of care. Because molecular testing is more sensitive than culture, clinicians must be cognizant to only test patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis to prevent detecting GAS colonization. Molecular testing does not distinguish between live or dead organisms, so molecular tests cannot be used to determine clearance of GAS following treatment. Testing for GAS by molecular methods can result in the missed opportunity to detect less common causes of bacterial pharyngitis such as Lancefield groups C and G \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, which are identified by throat culture. In an effort to identify additional bacterial causes of pharyngitis, some assays such as the Simplexa Group A Strep Assay detect Lancefield groups C and G \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci in addition to GAS.

Just like rapid antigen testing for GAS, testing for influenza and RSV is rapid and inexpensive, but lacks sensitivity at 50% to 70%. For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has discouraged the use of rapid antigen testing for influenza and RSV and promoted the use of molecular detection of these viruses. If rapid antigen testing must be used, the CDC recommends using these assays only when the prevalence of influenza or RSV in the community is greater than 10%, which raises the positive predictive value of the assay. Even when the prevalence is high, clinicians must interpret rapid antigen test results with caution, because a negative result does not exclude infection in a symptomatic patient.10\n",

In an effort to increase the sensitivity of Campylobacter detection in stool specimens, antigen tests are available for rapid Campylobacter spp testing. Unfortunately, a large multicenter study evaluated 4 Campylobacter antigen assays and found that despite relatively high specificity (>95%), the positive predictive value was only 36% to 51%.21 Based on these results, the use of Campylobacter antigen assays as stand-alone tests is not recommended.",

Finally, limited information is available on repeat multiplex testing.

Conversely, of patients with initially positive results, 53.8% remained positive for the same target within 4 weeks.36 Continued asymptomatic shedding has been observed for gastrointestinal pathogens.37, 38 Taken together, these results show that molecular testing is not appropriate as a test of cure and that continued detection of targets can occur for an indeterminate amount of time regardless of patient symptoms.

It detects bacterial (n = 6), viral (n = 7), and fungal pathogens (n = 1) from CSF specimens. One large prospective study examined 1560 CSF specimens from adults and children using the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel and found an 84.4% positive and greater than 99.9% negative agreement with the comparator methods.46 Although it was noted that an additional 21 pathogens were detected using the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel, there was also 22 unconfirmed/false positive detections. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) was the most frequent unconfirmed/false positive target, which the investigators proposed could be oral flora contamination during testing, necessitating the need for adherence to strict molecular testing procedures. In 2 pediatric specific studies examining the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel, strong agreement was seen with conventional methods.47, 48 Although in 1 study, 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 detections were missed by the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel that were likely near the LOD of the assay, HSV-1 was detected in both specimens by the standard-of-care LDT.48 It should be noted that 2 studies found that this panel demonstrated reduced sensitivity for Cryptococcus detection relative to antigen testing.49, 50 Finally, to date, there is no clinical report of the performance of this assay for detecting relatively low incident pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and only 1 report for Neisseria meningitidis,49 which was detected by the panel.",

K kingae is a fastidious bacterium that rarely grows in culture from septic joints. To improve sensitivity of pathogen detection, excess joint fluid can be inoculated into blood culture bottles and incubated for increased recovery of K kingae.52 Although there are no FDA-cleared molecular assays for detection of K kingae, testing is offered at reference laboratories and some hospitals have LDT PCR assays that are used clinically. Some pediatric orthopedic practices routinely test for K kingae in patients \u22644 years of age using either a K kingae\u2013specific PCR assays or 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing directly from joint specimens.53, 54 Both inoculation of joint fluid into blood culture bottles and molecular detection assays have markedly improved the rate of K kingae detection from joint specimens compared with bacterial culture alone.",

In addition, multiplex syndromic panels are allowing broad testing of pathogens associated with a single clinical presentation in a single assay.
