When accumulated changes disrupt its regulation of cell growth and death, the resulting uncharted growth leads to cancer. Carcinogenesis is a multi-step process: initiation, promotion, progression and metastasis. The \u201challmarks of cancer\u201d denote alterations in cancer cell physiology [2]. Indeed, only a very limited number of genes (140 or so), covering a dozen signaling pathways on the processes of cell fate, cell survival and genome maintenance, are relevant and designated as \u201cdriver\u201d mutations [3]. Histologically, a tumor is heterogeneous, consisting of cancer cells at various stages of differentiation, as well as other cell types (fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells). These cells behave as members of a community; the tumor microenvironment (niche) is a complex interactive network [4].",

In this case, \u201cpromiscuous drugs\u201d is a virtue; \u201cdirty\u201d might be better [11,12]. A phytochemical-drug combination is advantageous for synergistic effects. Such pairing allows lower effective doses than using a single compound for activity. Lower doses mean less potential toxicity and fewer side effects. For a particular cancer, various combinations can be explored to look for the ideal pair at optimal doses. For clinical use, the combination can be used alone (if both CSCs and bulk cancer cells are eliminated), or as adjuvant to conventional cancer therapy (the combination targets CSCs and conventional therapy eliminates the bulk cancer cells).",

Utilizing an array of mechanisms, CSCs are insensitive to conventional cancer treatments, but these mechanisms can be targets of phytochemicals and drugs (as described later) [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. (See Fig. 2\nfor key mechanisms of CSC resistance to therapy.) CSCs may be quiescent and exhibit a slow proliferating nature. They may possess an efficient DNA repair system, activated by genomic instability and regulated by epigenetic modifications via histone deacetylases. Pro-survival signaling pathways may be activated (Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch, PI3K, NF\u03baB). CSCs may have high levels of anti-apoptotic molecules. For drug resistance, both the activation of drug transporters, with high level expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporters for drug efflux, and the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), for drug metabolic activities, have been detected. In addition, their niche has less reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus less susceptible to radiation therapy.",

A cancer cell (transformed due to mutations) exhibits anchorage independence, a characteristic allowing it to form a cell colony in the absence of substratum, as shown by soft agar colony formation assay (normal cells die in the absence of attachment via the process of anoikis). For serum-free spheroid cultures (spheres), cancer cells grow as spheroids in suspension (in untreated plastic ware) when provided with specific growth factors (insulin, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor), unlike ordinary tissue culture where cells usually grow as a monolayer (with fetal bovine serum for growth factors and other components). Spheroids mimic the three-dimensional nature of tumors with limited oxygen available to the internal cells. This hypoxic condition favors expression of pluripotency maintaining transcription factors, thus promoting the differentiation to CSCs and facilitating the state of \u201cstemness\u201d [6]. Spheroids can form secondary and tertiary spheres in subsequent cultures. CSCs known as \u201cneoplastic sphere-forming cells\u201d are measured by enumerating secondary spheres generated when re-plating the spheres, based on the assumption that the secondary spheres are clones [23].

The second yielded salinomycin from the bacterium Streptomyces albus; it is toxic to humans so its use is confined to the poultry industry, as a coccidiostat for treating a parasitic protozoan disease [6]. For clinical uses, medicinal chemists must modify to remove teratogenicity or toxicity. Identified compounds must target only CSCs and not normal stem cells.

Turmeric is produced from rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa; it has multiple utilities and health benefits in traditional Indian medicine (from insect bites to wound healing). A widely studied property of curcumin is anti-inflammation. Curcumin inhibits many pro-inflammatory gene products, including enzymes (inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNOS), transcription factors (nuclear factor kappa B, NF\u03baB), cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, TNF\u03b1) and chemokines (interleukin-8, IL-8) [6]. Using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine sepsis model, we reported curcumin ingestion by gavage down-regulated iNOS gene expression in the murine liver [37]. Curcumin may suppresses carcinogenesis by down-regulating inflammation, which supports cancer cell survival, proliferation and invasion [2].",

            "text": "Another widely studied anti-cancer property of curcumin is CSC-targeting [[38], [39], [40], [41], [42]]. (See Table 2\nfor select cellular targets of phytochemicals and drugs in CSCs.) CSCs that resist conventional anti-cancer drugs are susceptible to curcumin. Curcumin acts on stem cell signaling pathways implicated in the process of carcinogenesis, including Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, and signal transduction and activator (STAT). For example, in hepatocellular carcinoma CSCs, Tsai et al. (2015) reported that curcumin inhibited SP, invasion, EMT and reduced tumor size and lung metastasis in a nude mice xenograft model. Immunoblots revealed that the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (SIPR3) signaling pathway was inhibited [43]. In cell culture, Subramaniam et al. (2012) reported that curcumin-induced apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells and decreased esophageal CSC spheroid size and number. The molecular mechanism was inhibition of the Notch pathway, seen as a decrease in RNA and protein expression of \u03b3 secretase, Notch-1 protein and its ligand Jaggard-1 [44]. The investigators also found down-regulated oncomir miRNA (miR-21, miR-34a) and up-regulated tumor suppressor miRNA (let-7a miRNA) in the curcumin-treated esophageal CSC spheroids. Similar to the esophageal example, for colorectal CSCs, Ramasamy et al. (2015) reported curcumin-induced epigenetic modifications, including the methylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promoter, expression of microRNA oncomirs relevant to metastasis (for EMT), as well as suppression of CSC markers (CD133, ALDH+) [42]. Thus, curcumin modifies epigenetically by inducing specific methylation changes and regulating microRNA expression. Huminiecki et al. (2017) have reviewed the functional genomic studies of curcumin from microarray, methylation array, microRNA array to RNA-seq and concluded that curcumin has \u201cpowerful effects\u201d on gene expression, including \u201cgenes involved in cell signaling, apoptosis, and the control of cell cycle\u201d [45].",

Mechanistically, immunofluorescence and immunoblot of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and \u03b2 catenin proteins showed that it induced autophagy and suppressed the Wnt pathway.

(2011) reported resveratrol inhibited pancreatic CSC spheroid formation via the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of mRNA expression of the pluripotency maintenance transcription factors (Oct 4, Nanog), as well as interference with EMT [57]. Similar inhibition was also observed in a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. With glioblastoma multiforme, Yang et al. (2012) found that CSCs pre-treated with resveratrol in vitro were less tumorigenic, as the xenografted SCID mice survive better than the untreated counterpart [58]. The investigators also performed microarray analyses and shRNA confirmation to compare the effects of resveratrol on CSCs (CD133+) and non-CSCs (CD133-). Resveratrol inhibited \u201cstemness\u201d gene expression and induced CSC differentiation via suppression of the STAT3 pathway.",

It overcame docetaxel resistance, and decreased the tumor size of docetaxel-resistant prostate CSCs (than either compound administered separately) [82]. Breast adipose tissue contributes to breast cancer development. Montales et al. (2013) found that genistein acted on the CSC niche and inhibited the differentiation of mammary stromal fibroblast-like cells to adipocytes [84]. The mechanism was inhibition of PPAR\u03b3 and fatty acid synthase gene expression. Interestingly, the investigators discovered genistein's biphasic effect, only seen in low dose (40 nM) but not high dose (2 \u03bcM). Montales et al. (2012) also found the effect of genistein to be transferrable [85]. When fed to mice at concentrations present in soy protein isolate (250 mg/kg food), their sera could inhibit the spheroid formation of human breast CSCs when added at 1\u20135% in cell culture. This suggests the presence of \u201cCSC inhibiting factors\u201d in the circulation after genistein consumption. Furthermore, genistein has transgenerational effect. Maternal dietary supplementation with genistein leads to DNA hyper-methylation in the embryo, and this methylation state is maintained until adulthood. The color change in the fur of genistein-fed agouti mice indicates an epigenetic biosensor for nutritional and environmental alterations on the fetal genome. Phytochemicals such as genistein modify the epigenome and the effect starts early in embryogenesis [86].",

It modulates energy metabolism by targeting AMPK and other AMPK-independent effects. Besides diabetes, metformin has been shown to be applicable to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [[91], [92], [93], [94], [95]]. It is in a clinical trial for longevity and ageing [96].",

For example, it synergized with the conventional combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC chemotherapy) in inhibiting breast CSCs derived from spheroids [97]. It enhanced the effect of denosumab, an antibody against RANKL (receptor activator of NF\u03baB ligand, a cytokine), in inhibiting breast CSC spheroids [98]. It enhanced the sensitivity of pancreatic CSCs to gemcitabine in vivo, significantly reducing the tumor volume in murine xenografts [99]. When given in combination, metformin and doxorubicin showed the advantage of targeting both breast CSCs and non-stem cancer cells, by reducing the overall tumor growth and tumor remission in nude mice [100]. Synergy was found with paclitaxel and carboplatin in prostate and lung CSCs murine xenografts [101]. For phytochemicals, Montales et al. (2015) reported that metformin and genistein targeted colon CSC spheroid formation and proliferation, and the combination increased the effectiveness of 5-FU [102]. Ning et al. (2016) reported that both curcumin and metformin individually inhibited pancreatic CSC spheroids [103], the two compounds should be tested as a combination. These examples suggest a combinational strategy for metformin to target CSCs and cancers [104].",

Simultaneous inhibition of multiple pathways (Wnt, Notch, mTOR, NF\u03baB) was indicated when niclosamide pretreatment inhibited glioblastoma xenograft development in nude mice. From 1258 drugs in the LOPAC chemical library, Wang et al. (2013) [109] and Yo et al. (2012) [110] selected niclosamide for its inhibition of breast and ovarian CSCs, respectively. Niclosamide inhibited spheroid formation and reduced tumor volume of xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. It acted on cisplatin-resistant ovarian CSCs. Spheroids from patient-derived CD133+ and ALDH+ ovarian cancer were susceptible to niclosamide, with inhibition of the Wnt pathway (shown by \u03b2 catenin immunoblot) [111]. Furthermore, it complements platinum drugs. Niclosamide in combination with carboplatin inhibited primary ovarian CSCs [111] and in combination with cisplatin inhibited breast CSC spheroid formation and reduced tumor size of xenografts in nude mice [112].",

Thioridazine was found to induce AML differentiation; it also synergized with cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine, AraC) in AML CSC killing. In glioblastoma CSCs, it induced autophagy (seen as expression of biomarker LC3) [114]. In lung, hepatoma and breast CSCs, it induced apoptosis in association with activation of caspases, inhibition of \u201cstemness\u201d gene expression (Oct4, CD133), and inhibition of the mTOR pathway, respectively [[115], [116], [117]]. Synergy with conventional drug has been shown: thioridazine was co-delivered with doxorubicin in mixed polymeric micelles to target both breast CSCs and bulk cancer cells [118]. We found that thioridazine and curcumin may act synergistically in inhibiting spheroids from ovarian cancer cells, with the combination more effective than either compound alone.

A single oral dose of resveratrol at 5 g in 10 volunteers caused only minor adverse effects [6]. With prior FDA approval, repurposed drugs are also presumably safe. Although individual compounds are safe, for the selected synergistic CSC-targeting phytochemical-drug combination, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics features, toxicity profiles, are still needed because this information is lacking.

For some polyphenolic compounds, effects in vivo, although significant, are less prominent than ones observed in vitro [134]. The bioavailability issue has been addressed with enhancing compounds, such as piperine from the spice black pepper (Piper nigrum), which amplifies the effect of phytochemicals (including curcumin). Bioavailability can be aided by formulations and special delivery systems, such as nanoparticles for curcumin and micelles for niclosamide [38,[135], [136], [137]]. Curcumin is an example which we managed to devise a measure to enhance bioavailability. By oral gavage to mice on empty stomach, we demonstrated in vivo effect: curcumin inhibition of the inflammatory iNOS in murine liver (beneficial outcome) and exacerbation of murine visceral leishmaniasis, a protozoan parasitic disease (detrimental outcome) [37,138]. Another concern is reliability of the source of phytochemicals. Consistent and unadulterated phytochemicals are essential, for example, curcumin as Curcumin C3 Complex from Sabinsa and EGCG as Polyphenon E from Mitsui Norin (as used in some clinical trials, see Table 1) [6]. (Repurposed drugs, as synthetic compounds, do not have this problem.) Yet another approach is the synthesis of better analogs and derivatives (such as difluorinated-curcumin and various chloroquine analogs), but they are beyond the scope of this review [32,40,54,120].",

(2015) found curcumin induced human glioma CSCs [139]. Kakarala et al. (2010) reported curcumin inhibited both breast CSCs and normal human breast stem cells, thus affecting both CSCs and normal stem cells [140]. These differences can be attributed to variations in dosage, length of treatment periods, grade and stability of compounds used, or other experimental conditions [133]. Polyphenolic phytochemicals have antioxidant capacities against reactive oxygen species (ROS), but under special conditions they exhibit pro-oxidant capacity [141]. Whereas ROS are harmful in general, the removal of too much ROS interferes with bodily functions, as seen in the warning presented by scientists to the food industry [142].",

A low dose stimulatory response is the hormetic effect, representing overcompensation in response to disruptions in homeostasis. A biphasic dose response is observed. At high concentrations, phytochemicals can be toxic, whereas sub-toxic doses may induce adaptive stress responses. Hormetic mechanisms of action have been proposed to underlie many of the health benefits of phytochemicals [6]. Protective effect of resveratrol is only observed in low dose but not high dose in a mouse colon cancer model [144]. Similar dose effects are seen in genistein [84].",
