Subsequently, a continuous inflammatory cycle of pleural irritation, DNA damage, and repair leads to mutations in mesothelial cells leading to the onset of disease. Inflammatory cytokines, including transforming growth factor-\u03b2, (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote proliferation and angiogenesis. Phagocytosis of asbestos fibres leads to release of oxygen free radicals inducing DNA mutations, and fibre penetration of mesothelial cells interferes with mitosis. Not all individuals exposed to asbestos develop mesothelioma, suggesting host genetics may predispose some individuals to disease. Rodents, particularly mice, from different genetic backgrounds have been exposed to asbestos fibres and monitored for development of mesothelioma. Strikingly, asbestos-induced mesothelioma in mice recapitulates the human disease with regard to disease latency, growth of tumour on the mesothelium, histopathology, and chromosomal abnormalities (see Sect. 2.5 below). Many murine cell lines have since been developed from asbestos-exposed mice (Table 18.1) and have contributed significantly to our current understanding of mesothelioma biology.",

Firstly, it is often difficult to regulate the number of asbestos fibres inhaled. Additionally, there is a high asbestos exposure risk to research staff and the immediate study environment. As such, inhalation studies often require specialised equipment and facilities at a cost that is often prohibitive to many research labs. Conversely, instillation of asbestos fibres via intraperitoneal (i.p.), intrapleural (i.pl), or intratracheal (i.tr) injection is more common as it is cost-effective and easily performed with minimal training. Both models are equally important, and it is the hypothesis being tested that should dictate which type of model is ultimately used. When investigating the potential carcinogenicity of airborne particles on human health, an inhalation study is warranted. However, when investigating biological processes that occur once disease is induced, injection models are no less useful; how the disease is induced is not the primary concern, but what happens biologically afterwards is.",

These models closely resemble the onset of human disease in terms of disease incidence (20\u201330% of exposed mice) and histological and morphological features, with the notable exception that unlike human mesothelioma, most mouse-derived mesotheliomas are sarcomatoid, with very little epithelioid or biphasic subtypes observed (Robinson et al. 2006). Nonetheless, these models have significantly aided our understanding of the mechanisms leading to onset of mesothelioma. Although many mouse exposure models recapitulate human mesothelioma, the low disease incidence (20\u201330% of exposed mice), and long latency period lag time to disease onset, is prolonged (0.5\u20132 years); asbestos exposure models are therefore inappropriate for many investigations such as molecular tumourigenesis and drug testing.",

Accordingly, mouse models have been developed in which these genes, either individually or in combination, are no longer expressed, i.e. the genes have been \u2018knocked out\u2019 (KO models). Mice in which a single copy of NF2 or p53 have been deleted (heterozygous KO mice) display increased incidence of mesothelioma (up to 80% of mice) and a shorter disease latency following asbestos exposure. Importantly, both NF2 and p53 heterozygous mice develop other types of highly metastatic lesions (Cleo Robinson et al. 2014) and other spontaneous cancers, such as lymphomas, sarcomas, and adenocarcinomas. It is also notable that these mouse models don\u2019t require exposure to asbestos for disease development and become complicated by spontaneous occurrence of many non-mesothelioma tumours. Whilst a disadvantage of these models is the induction of mesothelioma in the absence of asbestos exposure, they have still been instrumental in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that lead to mesothelioma following asbestos exposure.",

Whilst SV40 does not play a causative role in human mesothelioma, we utilise the oncogenic potential of TAg as a disease accelerator, producing a mouse model in which mesothelioma development is predictable, uniform, and reproducible, but only after asbestos exposure. MexTAg mice have higher disease incidence (up to 100%), develop mesothelioma with similar pathology, and show comparable treatment responses to human mesothelioma (Robinson et al. 2006, 2011,). Importantly, MexTAg mice are less likely to develop unrelated tumours compared to wild-type mice or the heterozygous or conditional mesothelioma knockout mouse models mentioned above. Expression analysis comparing MexTAg and wild-type mesotheliomas with their counterpart normal mesothelial cells demonstrates highly homologous gene expression profiles that suggest the TAg transgene does not affect the overall mechanism of mesothelioma development, but rather it phenocopies p16 loss \u2013 leading to increased disease incidence in these mice after asbestos exposure (Robinson et al. 2015). Thus, the MexTAg model is a functional equivalent of the deletion of tumour suppressor genes such as CDKN2A (p16INK4a/p14Arf), NF2, BAP1, or p53 that characterise human mesothelioma.",

More recently the development of new radiation therapy techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which allows delivery of high-dose radiotherapy to the hemithorax, has shown efficacy. In clinical trials IMRT after EPP led to a patient survival of 23.9\u201339.4 months (Perrot et al. 2017). Accordingly, IMRT adjuvant therapy has been introduced after P/D and EPP. Further studies are indicating that IMRT is a feasible option prior to surgery and may increase survival before EPP, as in the SMART protocol (Cho et al. 2014). Radiotherapy is also prophylactically used for biopsy tract metastases, which occur in around 20% of patients, but this is controversial and studies to date have been largely negative. A large randomised trial designed to definitively answer whether this procedure is beneficial is currently in progress (Bayman et al. 2016).",

In combination the VEGF neutralising antibody, bevaciumab, with pemetrexed has shown efficacy in high-expression VEGF xenografts and is thought to control mesothelioma progression (Thellung et al. 2016).",
