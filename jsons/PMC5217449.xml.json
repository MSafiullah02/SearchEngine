Indeed, bats are increasingly recognized as reservoirs for a wide range of viruses, some of which carry a zoonotic potential, for example rabies and other viruses of the genus Lyssavirus, SARS-like, MERS-like and other coronaviruses [2\u20135]. Consequently, several studies have investigated the genetic co-variation between different bat species and their associated viruses [6, 7]. However, much less is known about genetic co-variation of viruses and different populations of the same bat species, although such information is required to gain a better understanding of the transmission dynamics within a given host species (e.g. [8, 9]).",

While this species uses underground sites for hibernation during the winter months, it mostly roosts in trees and buildings during summer forming maternity colonies that consist of female bats and their juveniles as well as occasionally some males [12, 13]. Males typically roost either individually or in small groups in the vicinity of the maternity colonies [14]. Male and female Natterer\u2019s bats have been found to exhibit philopatry even though males leave their natal colony but stay in its vicinity [13]. Mating takes place during autumn at swarming sites that are typically up to 50 km away from the summer colony [13].",

The Astroviridae form a large family of non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses [19]. Astroviruses are mostly transmitted via the fecal-oral route [20] and may cause diarrhea in many animal species, including humans [21]. However, the route of transmission in bats has not yet been elucidated. Even though astroviruses have been detected in a variety of species [22], bats have been hypothesized to be a potential reservoir host in Europe and Asia [7, 23]. The high prevalence and diversity of astroviruses harbored by bats is remarkable [18, 21, 23] and their capability to cross species barriers and become adapted to new hosts, including spill-over to other taxa, has been suggested [24]. Due to the occurrence of astroviruses in animals in close contact to humans, e.g. livestock and also bats using human habitation as roosting, it has been argued that astroviruses should be considered as potential candidates for zoonotic infections (e.g. [24]). However, almost nothing is known about the transmission of astrovirus among different populations of their bat hosts.",

The population genetic structure of M. nattereri has previously only been investigated in the United Kingdom (UK; [13]). However, the population genetic structure of bats occurring in the UK may be affected by their insular status, and some important differences between insular and continental populations have been described (e.g. [25]). Thus, our study adds new important insights into the dispersal behavior of M. nattereri in mainland Europe. Moreover, we investigated for the first time if genetic co-variation occurs between populations of a bat host and its harboured astroviruses. Fischer et al. [18] reported distinctly higher similarities in astrovirus sequences of samples collected from the same bat species in different geographic localities than between samples from different species sampled at the same locality, whereas different results were obtained in the Czech Republic for some other European bat species [26]. Because our analyses are based on the sequences found by Fischer et al. [18] in M. nattereri, we assume that, similarly to coronaviruses in Chinese bats [27], astroviruses are mostly transmitted within Natterer\u2019s bats rather than within the local bat community as a whole. We hypothesized that if virus transmission between host populations were associated with events linked to gene flow in the bats, e.g. mating [28], genetic co-variation should be detectable between host populations and astroviruses on a larger scale (e.g. between geographic regions), even though not necessarily within a certain region.",

            "text": "Many bat astroviruses form distinct phylogenetic clusters [21], but little is known whether astrovirus population structure matches that of their host species. As astroviruses are hypothesized to be transmitted via the fecal-oral route [20], both direct and indirect virus transmission within the breeding colonies of bats and at swarming sites during mating seem possible [8]. In comparison, for bat ectoparasites such as bat flies (Nycteribiidae) that are also transmitted both by direct body contact and indirectly through the bats\u2019 roosts, a more efficient transmission among different bat populations has been detected at swarming sites as compared to breeding colonies [29]. As swarming sites represent the main mating sites for M. nattereri, where gene flow occurs, it is expected that if viruses are also mainly transmitted between conspecifics during that period, the transmission route of the viruses should resemble the pattern of host gene flow. Since transmission of astroviruses at swarming sites would cause viruses to be transmitted between members of different colonies visiting a given swarming site, local differentiation should not occur at the colony level but rather on a larger scale. Viral genetic patterns should therefore follow an isolation-by-distance pattern using swarming sites as stepping-stones for gene flow, as suggested for the bat host [30].",

Relatedness densities were further plotted using R (R Core [46]) in order to determine the relatedness threshold for excluding individuals from the analyses. This threshold was selected manually by best separating the first peak of the plotted distribution (i.e. closely related individuals) from the rest (unrelated individuals). From every pair of individuals with a relatedness value exceeding the determined threshold (0.3), one individual was randomly removed, respectively. All other analyses, except for Structure, were performed on the whole data set. As uneven sampling can bias inferences on the number of clusters in the program Structure [47], efforts were made to have comparable number of individuals from the three regions investigated after the removal of closely related individuals (71 from BY, 73 from NRW and 104 from MV; cf.

This PCR assay enables the detection of a variety of bat-associated astroviruses by using degenerated primers. Further details of the virus-related sampling and laboratory are presented in Fischer et al. [18]. A total 57 sequences representing 19 different astrovirus haplotypes (=sequences having 100% identity) (N1-19, Fig. 4) were identified from the screening of 270 samples. Three haplotypes were excluded from the analyses (N17-19, Fig. 4) as they were phylogenetically too distant from the remaining 16 and too rarely encountered (only once per haplotype) to make biologically meaningful inferences about their correlation to the bat host\u2019s population genetic structure. Out of the 270 samples, Fischer et al. [18] were able to assign 73 individual sequences to a specific haplotype (N1-19, Fig. 4), whereas the remaining astrovirus positive samples were shorter than 279 nt and could therefore not be assigned to a haplotype. As in this study we only analyzed individually marked adult female bats that were clearly identifiable via their RFID-tag, in total 57 individual sequences, representing these 16 different haplotypes, were used (N1-16, Fig. 4).",

Significant genetic differentiation was further identified among colonies within regions (F\nST = 0.0194, P = 0.0001). When analyzing the data obtained by the mitochondrial DNA marker AT-2, pairwise genetic differentiation was found to be much higher at both geographic scales (among regions: F\nST = 0.4979, P = 0.0001; among colonies within regions: F\nST = 0.3657, P = 0.0001).\n",

This would result in gene flow following a stepping-stone model and would both lead to a significant isolation-by-distance over larger scales [71] and to the absence or a weak signal on a local scale [30, 33]. Within the UK, isolation-by-distance was not detected between summer colonies of M. nattereri unless distances exceeded 100 km [30]. Our results agree with those obtained by Rivers et al. [30] as we also did not detect significant genetic isolation-by-distance between summer colonies within a given region in Germany (even though there is a trend in MV), but over the study area as a whole. Therefore, we suggest that the isolation-by-distance pattern observed here is generated by swarming sites acting as stepping-stones for gene flow.",

Based on the partial sequence of the conserved RdRp gene analysed in this study [21], where the mean amino acid distances ranged from 0.022 to 0.059 within and 0.573\u20130.679 between clusters, the analyzed haplotypes form six different groups which might represent six different viral species [61] (C1-6, Fig. 4). The detection of the same putative viral species in the different regions combined with the estimated divergence times (<10 years for within species) suggests occasional transmission between host populations. Both the observed genetic population structure of M. nattereri and existing data from ringing studies in Germany [72] show that Natterer\u2019s bats rarely if ever move over long distances (more than 100 km). Thus, it is unlikely that individual bats directly transmit a certain virus haplotype between the three geographic regions analyzed (NRW, BY and MV). Since viruses have a considerably higher mutation rate [73] compared to the bat host, mutations in the virus sequences do occur within much shorter time scales than mutation in the bats\u2019 genome [74, 75]. As bats need to transmit the astroviruses directly, the movement of viruses across the landscape should mirror the movement of the bats and hence occur successively over large distances following the stepping stone model of the host. As a consequence, virus transmission over large distances is likely to take multiple years. In the course of these successive transmissions events, mutations will occur in the virus which will lead to viral population differentiation as we observe within the putative viral species.",

We had originally expected that if the transmission route of astrovirus sequences resembles the pattern of host gene flow, genetic co-variation between astroviruses and host populations should be detected, especially across regions. The reason why no such correlation was found for M. nattereri and its associated astroviruses could be due to strong differences in population size (hence genetic drift) and mutation rate between bats and viruses. In contrast to higher Eukaryotes such as the bat host, RNA viruses are subject to higher selective pressures and combined with a high mutation rate allow continuous and rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions [73, 76, 77]. Coupled with large population sizes, virus evolution can thus already be observed within very short time scales of weeks to months [74, 75]. The frequent fluctuations in the prevalence of viral populations (e.g. bottlenecks) and hence the higher genetic drift they face might prevent these populations from showing patterns of isolation-by-distance [78]. Moreover, our virus sampling could only be performed during the summer period since only some of the autumn swarming sites are known so far. Additionally, due to logistic reasons exact sampling dates differed between the sampling localities, which could blur the signal if some haplotypes or putative viral species are more abundant in different periods (see Additional file 1: Table S1). Finally, although large from a virology perspective, the number of samples with viral material was relatively limited to perform population genetics analyses. This combined with the variations in sampling times could confound our analysis if viruses show quick temporal variation in prevalence and/or turnover. A further possible explanation for the lack of a genetic correlation between hosts and viruses is that at swarming sites bats may not only interact in ways that lead to gene flow. Multiple mating and contact between individuals that does not result in successful mating might also represent transmission opportunities for viruses that are not reflected within the host genetic pattern.",

The observed population genetic structure indicates that no apparent strong barriers to gene flow exist within our study area for the bat host. While putative viral species were mostly shared between geographic regions, no haplotypes were shared for any putative viral species. Despite the observed genetic differentiation between the three geographic regions in the bat host and to a certain extent also in the harbored astroviruses, we did not detect a correlation between host and virus genetic distances. This could potentially be due to differences in genetic drift, selective pressure, population size and mutation rate between bats and viruses. Further studies with a higher astrovirus sample size and with specific simultaneous sampling during autumn mating at swarming sites are required to shed further light on the host-virus relationship between bats and their astroviruses.",
