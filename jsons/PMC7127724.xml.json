Because of the potentially devastating progression of NEC, precautions need to be taken. In this scenario, clinical judgment based on the patient's condition should guide whether and how long the patient should be taken off enteral feedings, whether and how long intravenous antibiotics should be used, and how aggressively the patient is monitored with radiographs and laboratory tests. Once a definitive diagnosis is made but the patient has not progressed to surgical NEC (usually stage 3), the bowel should be decompressed using a large-bore orogastric tube with low intermittent suction. Careful attention needs to be placed on managing fluids and electrolytes because considerable third spacing of fluids with losses of sodium and protein may occur. Potassium fluxes (high or low serum potassium) with acid-base imbalances are likely to occur. Renal failure is a frequent concomitant finding. Systemic antibiotic therapy, usually with ampicillin and gentamicin, are started after obtaining blood cultures. In cases in which resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis is suspected, vancomycin is used instead of ampicillin. When perforation is suspected, or has occurred, clindamycin or metronidazole is used to treat anaerobic infection. Intensive support of respiratory and circulatory status is provided, as are frequent monitoring of the abdominal status with left lateral decubitus radiographs and frequent monitoring of acid-base and hematologic status. A persistent acidosis with continued deterioration of platelet and white blood cell counts may be an indication for surgery even in the absence of overt perforation on radiography.",

Infants born at a gestational age of 26 to 29 weeks had a more mature period of permeability at birth, followed by a temporary period of enhanced permeability at 3 to 4 weeks of age. Overall, there seems to be a developmental pattern of decreased permeability with maturation.

In postnatal life, the previously sterile intestine becomes colonized with bacteria and is frequently stressed with relatively concentrated feedings. What accounts for the exclusive onset of NEC in the postnatal state? Perhaps, some of the components of amniotic fluid are highly protective to the fetal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The fact that the GI tract of the fetus is not colonized with bacteria or exposed to a high volume of lumenal nutrients also likely has a role.",

It is tenable that inflammatory mediators released after endotoxin or bacterial invasion across the mucosa may lead to vasoconstriction and hypoxic-ischemic insults. The vascular control systems are known to be quite immature in these infants and could make the premature intestine more susceptible to the development of local tissue hypoxia.86 Resting vascular resistance is known to be low in premature infants. The endothelium of the small intestine is responsible for the production of nitric oxide, a potent mediator known to maintain low resting vascular resistance. If endothelial injury occurs, subsequent damage to the nitric oxide system likely could have a detrimental effect on local vascular tone, which could, at least theoretically, result in some of the tissue injury seen in NEC that is compatible with an ischemic insult.78 Thus, other triggers, such as bacterial toxins or chemical irritation, could set off a cascade of events that could lead to endothelial disruption, altered nitric oxide production, and subsequently vascular compromise.86 The specific relationship of endotoxin, PAF, and nitric oxide together with other mediators remains to be elucidated. Whether elucidation of this pathway might result in a potential treatment or prevention for NEC is discussed later.",

This has, in many cases, caused neonatologists to institute an overly cautious approach to enteral feedings whereby the baby is placed NPO for several weeks after birth and nourished only by the parenteral route. This approach is known to cause atrophy of the intestinal mucosa and may be highly detrimental in that the onset of NEC may be delayed only after feedings are finally instituted. An alternative approach with several different names, including \"minimal enteral nutrition,\" \"intestinal priming,\" and \"hypocaloric feedings,\" has been studied in a controlled randomized manner38, 79 involving use of enteral nutrition to provide topical nutrition to the small intestine during the first week or two of life while providing most of the nutritional needs for the infant by the parenteral route. It is usually reserved for infants weighing less than 1500 grams. \"Priming\" is not contraindicated while the infant is on ventilatory support or using umbilical catheters. The enteral feedings are increased so that the infant is on full enteral intake in the third to fourth week of life. This approach has been found to improve tolerance to subsequent enteral intake, stimulate early secretion of several intestinal hormones that may be trophic in the intestinal mucosa, and improve motility.16 Despite demonstrating these advantages, the numbers from the individual studies were too small to determine whether this approach caused a significant decrease in the incidence of NEC.",

The carbohydrate found in human milk and most commercial infant formulas is lactose. There is some controversy as to whether the premature small intestine has the capability to hydrolyze lactose to the same degree as that of the term infant.83 Also, the lactose not hydrolyzed by the intestine may be hydrolyzed by bacteria, with the subsequent fermentative generation of hydrogen gas and short-chain fatty acids.61 The presence of certain bacteria that have an especially efficient capability to ferment lactose using beta-galactosidase could lead to a high concentration of lumenal short-chain fatty acids, which could alter the pH of the small bowel and cause mucosal breakdown, with the invasion of bacteria into the mucosa and production of pneumatosis intestinalis.26 In the upper GI tract, the situation is different than in the distal. Many premature infants are hypochlorhydric and do not respond as quickly as older children or adults to a meal with brisk production of gastric acid and peptic proteases.48, 83 This acid environment is an effective barrier to many potentially pathogenic microorganisms. A prospective doubleblind study that compared the incidence of NEC in a group of infants fed a regular formula to infants fed a formula supplemented with acid to achieve a pH between 3 and 4 showed a lower incidence of NEC in the acid-supplemented group.27 These studies should be confirmed before considering routine use of this method.",

Viruses such as coronavirus and rotavirus have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC but have not been consistently found. As previously discussed, it is highly likely that bacteria are involved, not necessarily as triggering agents, but as agents that enable the pathophysiologic cascade of NEC to proceed. The fact that so many premature neonates are placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics shortly after birth to rule out sepsis changes the gut flora toward resistant organisms that are likely to possess virulence factors very different than those in the normal flora. Perhaps strong consideration should not be given to pre-emptively treating all premature babies with antibiotics for 3 days pending culture results as is so commonly done. Obviously, the risk of sepsis needs to be carefully weighed against the likelihood of altering the bacterial microenvironment in each individual baby. Some bacteria cultured from babies with NEC have been found to have the capability to inhibit adherence of normal gut flora to CaCo-2 cells in culture.92 Other studies have shown that certain bacteria isolated from neonates with NEC have a highly efficient capability to ferment lactose in the presence of hydrolytic products of casein.26 These bacteria in turn were found to have the capability to produce severe intestinal damage in isolated rabbit intestinal loops. When isolated from the original bacterium and cloned into an otherwise nonpathogenic bacterium, the previously nonpathogenic bacterium becomes a rapid lactose fermenter and is able to cause disease in the isolated rabbit intestinal loops. There are likely to be numerous other virulence traits possessed by NEC-associated bacteria that have not yet been identified. Identification of these traits, proof of their pathogenicity, and subsequent production of neither active nor passive immunity against them offer the likelihood of specific prophylaxis against NEC.",

This amino acid has been found to attenuate various forms of enterocolitis in animal models and to decrease permeability to lactulose and mannitol in adults. It is thought to become an essential amino acid during times of stress. It is not normally supplied to these babies in appreciable quantities by either the enteral or parenteral route because most premature neonates are not provided with appreciable enteral nutrition, and neonatal TPN solutions do not contain glutamine.
