Because they usually exist under the form of unique enantiomer, we numbered the natural products by an arabical digit irrespective to their optical rotation sign, e.g., cephalotaxine (CET) (1), their antipode by ent-digit, e.g., ent-cephalotaxine ent-(1), and the corresponding racemic compound usually obtained by chemical synthesis rac-digit, e.g., rac-cephalotaxine rac-(1). In the asymmetric synthesis section, we have precised the sign of the optical rotation, e.g., CET (\u2212)-(1), ent-CET (+)-(1), and rac-CET (\u00b1)-(1).",

            "text": "For more than 50 years, chemists have studied the extraction, structure determination, biogenesis, and synthesis of CET (1) (Fig. 2), the major alkaloid of this series, and related alkaloids, because of the reported biological activity of its natural esters 2\u20135, in view of their therapeutical use in the treatment of leukemia. Homoharringtonine (HHT) (2) and harringtonine (HT) (3), or a mixture of both, have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) since the 1970s to treat a variety of malignancies. HHT (2) being the easiest to purify and the most abundant in the plant was selected by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for clinical development. HHT (2), also known as omacetaxine, a simple ester of CET (1), probably holds the record for the longest time to reach the market20 after having experienced increasing interest since its first use in TCM, and efforts by pharmaceutical companies for its development as an antileukemic agent. Despite its clinical efficacy, natural HHT (2) was not recorded until now, simply because normal extract formulations have raised several unresolved problems, such as the reproduction of a constant product from defined extraction procedure, the purity profile, the main source of the raw material in China, and biodiversity conservation issues. The Cephalotaxus shrubs with extremely slow growth are mostly protected and endangered species. Moreover, CET (1) and its active esters are present in small quantities in the plant (roots, bark, heartwood, and leaves), which hardly makes possible to exploit it to obtain HHT (2) or its related esters. Semisynthetic HHT (ssHHT) (2) (Myelostat, Ceflatonin, or Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OM)) is manufactured by a semisynthetic process developed by Robin from naturally occurring alkaloid CET (\u2212)-(1) extracted from the dry leaves of Cephalotaxus harringtonia, and a synthetic precursor side chain.21 Although HHT (2) was investigated for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the 1990s with good results, the advent of Imatinib (IM) mesylate, a breakpoint cluster region and Abelson (BCR-ABL)1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) at that time delayed the interest for HHT (2). However, de novo or acquired resistance to TKIs22 renewed the interest for this alternative first-in-class simple natural ester of CET (1). HHT (2) is currently approved in Europe and in the United States, due to its reported activity in patients with CML resistant to currently available TKIs. As a result, on September 2, 2004, orphan designation (EU/3/04/224) was granted by the European Union for OM (International nonproprietary name (INN), trade name Synribo)/HHT (2) for the treatment of CML to Stragen France SAS, France, for the treatment of CML. Exploitation rights were transferred to ChemGenex Europe SAS, France, in January 2009 and subsequently to Teva Pharma GmbH, Germany, in December 2012. Due to their different mechanisms of action, combinations with TKIs represent attractive treatment options. Recently, on October 26, 2012, HHT (2), Synribo (formerly Ceflatonin, Omapro), received an accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with chronic-phase (CP) or accelerated-phase (AP) CML with resistance or intolerance to two or more TKIs. The US FDA has granted full approval to HHT (2) (drug substance INN OM, Synribo) for injection, based on the final analysis of two phase II trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability data of omacetaxine in 2014. This renewed interest for isolation, characterization, biological evaluation, and total synthesis of cephalotaxus alkaloids and analogs to suppress the dependance on natural source supply.\n",

These alkaloids exhibited low cytotoxicity against nasopharynx KB cells with IC50 values of 30, 14, 31, and 15 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. ACs of cephalezomines G (42) and H (43) described by Kobayashi and Morita50 from the leaves of Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. harringtonia were determined by circular dichroism (CD) as 2S,3R for cephalezomine G (42) and 2R,3R for cephalezomine H (43). However, the structure of cephalezomine H (43), initially assigned as a trans diol was revised to a syn-\u03b2,\u03b2-diol after total synthesis (Fig. 7).51 Some uncertainty remained, however, due to the divergent optical rotations of the synthetic and the natural compounds.",

While this correlation seems doubtful, since only one stereogenic carbon center is present in structures 12 and 44, these findings imply that the second stereogenic center is the nitrogen atom that lost its fast inversion properties, as observed in the X-ray studies showing the rigid structure of CET (1).53 Compound 44 showed no cytotoxic activity against the Hep G2, MCF-7, Hep 3B, and HT-29 human cancer cell lines.",

For example, the use of modern methods of extraction provides up to 2 kg of pure CET (1) from a ton of dry leaves, that is 0.2% of dry matter. Robin et al. studied a method of preparation of HHT (2) by semisynthesis from natural CET (1) by attachment of the side chain (see Section 3). Purification provided a product, the purity of which was 99.8% against 98.5% for NCI products and 95%\u201397% for products of Chinese origin (Table 7).63 For example, 550 g of HHT (2) was injected into a preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (diameter 45 cm, height 1 m containing 48 kg of ODS stationary phase). The elution was performed using a gradient of buffered solution of pH 3 methanol-water as mobile phase (flow rate 540 L/h, 1200 psi). The collected fractions (20\u201350 L) were separated by UV detection and analyzed by HPLC. After eliminating fractions with about 0.5% of the total content of HHT (2), fractions suitable for drug specification (purity > 99.8%) were combined. HPLC analysis of the organic phase after HHT recovery (basified to pH 8.5 and extracted with dichloromethane) showed a level of impurities less than 0.5%. HHT (2) (210 g) was then recrystallized by dissolution in 240 mL of methanol at 30\u00b0C and filtered at 0.25 microns for sterilization, and then deionized water (2.4 L) was added and methanol was distilled off. The aqueous solution of HHT (2) DS (quality \u201cdrug substance\u201d) or \u201cdrug substance\u201d quality (DS) was held in a decontaminated rotary evaporator until the appearance of white crystals of pure HHT (2). After filtration and drying under vacuum at 60\u00b0C for 2 days, 88% overall yield (OY) of HHT (2) was obtained when compared to its potential content in the semisynthetic gross HHT (2). This corresponds to a clinical batch allowing for the preparation of 40,000 therapeutic dosage units containing 5 mg containing less than 0.03% of impurities.63\n",

The extraction step plays an important role in the overall purification process of HHT (2). Traditional methods of isolation and purification of the chemical constituents of plant tissues have some disadvantages. These approaches require very long extraction times and usually a large amount of solvent with sometimes low efficiency. Furthermore, many natural products are thermally unstable and may degrade during hot extraction. To overcome these drawbacks, a new method of extracting HHT (2) from Cephalotaxus koreana using microwave extraction (MWE) was developed by Kim et al.66 The MWE process of HHT (2) recovery (biomass/MeOH 1/6 m/v, 250 rpm) gave a performance of the first biomass extraction 25% higher than the conventional solvent extraction (CSE) method for which at least four extractions were required. It was possible to recover more than 99% of HHT (2) extracting once the biomass by MWE at 40\u00b0C for 15 min or 50\u00b0C for 5 min. Because the content of tars and waxy compounds were also increased, an adsorbent was added to the biomass (1/1.5 m/m) during the MWE extraction. The use of the MWE process for the extraction of HHT (2) when compared to a CSE one has many advantages such as shorter extraction time, reduced amount of solvent, and higher yield resulting in a less costly production system for a superior product. Ultrasonic-MWE of C. fortunei produced CET (1) in a simple, highly efficient, and low cost process, suitable for its industrial production in high purity after two recrystallizations from anhydrous ethanol.67\n",

The crude base (24.5 g) containing 71% of CET (1) was dissolved in a mobile phase consisting of ortho-phosphoric acid and deionized water containing 1.55% triethylamine (pH 3). The acid additive constrained the alkalization of the obtained aqueous phase and its extraction with dichloromethane. CET (1) (18 g) was fully recovered from the crude alkaloid extract as a white solid with an HPLC purity greater than 95%. The limited supply of promising secondary metabolites from their natural sources is a major hurdle to their pharmaceutical development; however, strategies to overcome this problem were developed. For instance, to increase the yield of natural anticancer drug alkaloids from natural sources, methods of extraction are developed. Recovering CET (1) from C. harringtonia, var. fastigiata with vegetable oil in the presence of an aqueous carbonate aqueous phase yielded 5% CET (1) with a purity of 26%.70 The extraction performed with a mixture of scCO2 (supercritical CO2) with MeOH-10% Et2NH yielded 0.0029% CET (1) of undescribed purity.71 HHT (2) was also obtained from C. koreana.72 He et al. have developed an HPLC analysis method for HHT (2) determination,73 allowing to reveal three congeners present as impurities in the HHT (2) samples. Two impurities are new: \u03b1-isoHHT (73) is an isomer of HHT (2) in which the hydroxyl group is alpha to the isopropyl group and ethyl-HHT (74), the ethyl ester of HHT (2), is an isolation artifact of HHT (2) with ethyl acetate, the third being HT (3) (Table 7\n). \u03b1-IsoHHT (73) was found concentrated in the crystallization mother liquors of HHT (2) (10.7% against 1%\u20133% in crude extracts). The HPLC analysis according to He's protocol therefore allows the determination of HHT (2) in crude samples with a linear response from 4 to 12 \u03bcg and a limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 27 \u03bcg. It was used to assess the purity of several HHT (2) commercial batches.63\n",

HT (3) represents the main alkaloid (72%\u201392% for SoC in 45 days, and 50%\u201367% for SuC for 30 days) while the HHT (2) content is only 4%\u201321% in SoC and 23%\u201340% in SuC, the remaining being isoHT (4).",

The number of asymmetric syntheses has grown considerably from only 3 before 1997 to 18 until 2015, inflecting the development of asymmetric synthesis, and the efforts to provide a fully synthetic access to the drug (Table 10\n). The present section describes the recent synthetic strategies organized according to the main carbon\u2013carbon bond disconnections of the central azepine ring B (Fig. 13\n). Asymmetric syntheses are also classified based on the type of asymmetric center control. The key steps are highlighted for each strategy. Most of these syntheses are formal; nevertheless, the OY of each synthesis up to CET (1) was evaluated. Eight racemic and five asymmetric syntheses of CET (1) are total syntheses, with only one racemic and three asymmetric routes described since mid-1997, with experimental OY and enantiomeric excess (ee). The OY and the number of steps (NS) are given from commercially available reagents for comparison purpose. In addition, for convergent syntheses, total number of steps (TNS), which represents the total efforts to be accomplished up to the target molecule, and the corresponding average yield (AY) are given. Synopses of the syntheses of CET (1) reported so far are presented in Table 9 (racemic) and Table 10 (asymmetric). Besides formal syntheses targeting Weinreb's enamine grouped together in Table 9, racemic syntheses are classified according to the type of disconnection of ring B (a\u2013e, Fig. 13), the type of intermediate in the formal syntheses and then in a chronological order. The asymmetric syntheses are presented in chronological order in Table 10.",

The selective formation of Mori's tetracyclic intermediate (\u00b1)-88 can be explained by an oxidative addition of the palladium complex to the double bond syn to the nitrogen atom followed by a syn elimination of PdH. Mori's procedure85 would allow to complete the synthesis of rac-CET (\u00b1)-(1) in 12 steps (longest linear sequence (LLS)) and 5.2% OY from 1,3-cyclopentanedione (77) (2.5% AY in 15 TNS). It should be mentioned that Mori's protocols differ for the synthesis of racemic or optically active CET (1). Indeed, the transformation of desmethyl CET (12) into cephalotaxinone (10) using 2,2-dimethoxypropane and p-TsOH led to racemization of the product (76% yield). On the contrary, when p-TsOH and methyl orthoformate were used for this transformation at room temperature (rt), limited racemization occurred (ee 88%), but the yield went down to 47%.",

Ring B was installed by ring expansion of pyrroloisoquinoline 132, which resulted from the cyclization of N-acyliminium ion intermediate 131. Alkyne 127 that contains C5, C6, C7, and C8 carbon atoms of ring C and C2, C3, and C4 carbon atoms of the CET skeleton was prepared in four steps (63% OY) from 4-pentyn-1-ol 125. Coupling of 127 with homopiperonylamine 83 (which could be obtained from piperonal 80 in two steps and 64% OY), gave amide 128 whose treatment with LiHMDS and catalytic amounts of silver triflate gave the AC enamide 129 by intramolecular N-heterocyclization. Oxidation of 129 with dimethyldioxirane delivered the unstable methoxylactam 130 immediately treated with BF3\u00b7OEt2 producing pyrroloisoquinoline 132 via the N-acyliminium ion 131. Ring-expansion reaction of the six-membered ring elaborated the seven-membered ring B (132 \u2192 133). Aldehyde 134 was isolated after debenzylation of 133 followed by Dess\u2013Martin oxidation. The missing C1 carbon atom in aldehyde 134 was introduced by aldol reaction with the lithium enolate of benzyl acetate. Subsequent oxidation of the resulting aldol gave \u03b2-keto-ester 135. Formation of ring D was accomplished via Mannich cyclization of N-acyliminium ion 136 and elimination of hydroiodic acid to produce the enone 138. The final compound of this formal synthesis, spiroketone (\u00b1)-139 reported by Hanaoka96 was isolated after decarbobenzyloxylation followed by catalytic reduction. Application of Hanaoka's procedure (3 steps, 34% OY) to complete the synthesis from compound (\u00b1)-139 would provide an access to rac-CET (\u00b1)-(1) in 20 steps and 3.1% OY from 4-pentyn-1-ol 125.",

The azido ester 289 was obtained in high diastereoselectivity (dr > 97:3) resulting from exo-selective azidation of the bicyclic intermediate radical 288. The spirolactam 290 was obtained by reduction of the azide. First, the stereogenic center at C5 (CET numbering) of (S)-cyclopentenol 284 was used to control the configuration of the newly formed diol at C1\u2013C2, and then it was destroyed on double bond formation in 287. This chiral center was eventually controlled during the carboazidation step leading to 289. This sequence corresponds to the concept of self-regeneration of stereogenic centers.126 Reduction of the lactam 290 gave an amine, which was N-alkylated with nosylate 91 (see Scheme 4), to afford the ACD aryl iodide 291. After hydrolysis of the acetonide, the diol was converted to thionocarbonate 292, which on treatment with Corey\u2013Hopkins\u2019 reagent afforded the desired alkene (R)-102.

After deprotection of the amine, amide formation with the carboxylic acid 89 and reduction of the resulting amide 337 led to the pivotal alkylidene carbene precursor 338.

Regioselective iodination of the aromatic ring system gave the Heck-cyclization precursor 340. Its X-ray crystal structure allowed the confirmation of its absolute stereochemistry, thus demonstrating that as expected the 1,5-CH insertion reaction had proceeded with retention of configuration. The Heck cyclization under modified Fu's conditions (Pd(OAc)2, HBF4\u00b7PtBu3, Cs2CO3) delivered the ABCD olefin 341 in 61% yield, together with enamine 342 (30%).

Radical desulfurization followed by hydrolysis of pivalate and reacylation with benzyl chloroformate led to 382. After diol deprotection, differentiation of the C1 and C2 oxygen substituents was achieved by using Boc2O and Yb(OTf)3 leading to a selective C1-O-carboxylation. The hydroxy group at C2 was oxidized to ketone using iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX). The enone 383 reacted with CrCl2, which induced reductive deoxygenation of the O-Boc group. Subsequent benzylcarbonate hydrogenolysis provided demethylcephalotaxinone (\u2212)-12 (Weinreb's intermediate83). Sequential methyl enol ether derivatization of the C2 ketone (55%) and stereoselective reduction at C3 with NaBH4 (95%) concluded the synthesis of (\u2212)-CET (1) in 25 steps from d-ribofuranose (365) and 1.0% OY (ee n.r.).",

This mixture reacted with spirocyclic amine (\u00b1)-110 (see Scheme 5) under reductive amination conditions to give diastereomers 415 and 416 in a 1:1 ratio, which were smoothly separated by chromatography. Both diastereomers were submitted separately to Heck reaction conditions to produce benzazepines (+)-417 and (\u2212)-418.

On the other hand, 462 gave homodeoxyHT (\u2212)-(22) in 69% yield when submitted to Pd/C catalyzed hydrogenation in glacial AcOH.",

The synthesis started with the preparation of the known chiral imine 465 (Scheme 50\n), which was subjected to a Michael reaction with acetoxyacrylonitrile (466), an equivalent of the acid side chain. The adduct 467 was proved to be stereochemically homogeneous and was hydrolyzed without purification to give the more stable ketone (R,R)-468. The keto group was protected as a dioxolane and the potential aldehyde function was directly transformed into the ester 469 on treatment with MnO2 in MeOH in the presence of NaCN. The ketal of ester 469 was cleaved using CeCl3\u00b77H2O and NaI, and the so-formed keto group was converted to the silylvinyl ether 470. Ozonolysis of 470 gave the sensitive aldehyde 471. Addition of MeMgBr to the crude aldehyde and esterification of the acid furnished alcohol 472. Oxidation of the alcohol 472 to a methylketone followed by new addition of MeMgBr gave the tertiary alcohol, which eventually on hydrogenolysis led to (R)-methyl 3,7-dihydroxy-3-methylcarbonyl-7-methoxyoctanoate (473), the methyl derivative of HHT side chain.",

The synthesis began with known N-Boc ester (S)-512 of l-aspartic acid obtained through a two-step process (94%). The gem-dimethyl group was first installed by a Grignard reaction to give 513, which was transformed into the lactol 514 by IBX oxidation and concomitant cyclization. The Wittig reaction with phosphorane 515 followed by deprotection and N-bisbenzylation of the amino group furnished key allylamine (S)-516. The Meisenheimer rearrangement occurred on treatment with mCPBA on the latter to give hydroxylamine 517. This compound led to 518 on treatment with H2 on catalytic Pd/C via double bond saturation and then N\u2013O bond cleavage. Eventually, on oxidation of 518 the HHT's side chain acid (R)-481 was obtained whose methylation yielded the corresponding dimethyl ester (R)-473. Its optical rotation indicated a perfect stereochemical outcome of the rearrangement. A similar process allowed synthesis of a cyclic form of the HT's side chain. Starting from l-threonine (519), amino alkene 520 was prepared in seven steps. The Meisenheimer rearrangement occurred on treating 520 with mCPBA to give the sensitive hydroxylamine 521.

            "text": "In conclusion, the study of many syntheses of CET (1) published to date can draw a number of conclusions about the key points of its structure and the way chemists have overcome the problems posed by its synthesis. The formation of the B ring often remains a crucial point in building the CET skeleton. The C4\u2013C13 disconnection remains by far the most studied (>30 syntheses of 50). The cyclization reactions used (electrophilic aromatic substitutions, organometallic coupling, etc.) perform generally with good yields but seem susceptible to cyclization intermediates and electronic richness of the aromatic ring. This disconnection is also extremely interesting from a stereochemical point of view providing the correct relative configuration at C4 and C5, avoiding difficult separations. Other disconnections do not always give such good results and are not completely diastereoselective. The formation of the spiro CD system is also a key point in these syntheses; in fact, the control of center C5 at the start of synthesis greatly simplified stereocontrolled strategies and enabled enantioselective approach to CET (1) by asymmetric synthesis of the CD system. Subsequent stereoinduction of the C5 center on C4 center and C4 center on the C3 center facilitate the production of optically active CET (1). However, the operating conditions used after the synthesis of the spiro system must be chosen carefully because of the risk of racemization of CET (1) and certain synthetic intermediates by breaking the N9\u2013C5 bond (See Figure 18, Figure 19, the conversion of Mori's intermediates (\u00b1)-88 and (\u2212)-88). Last but not least, from an industrial point of view, initially the Merck Group took over the Weinreb racemic synthesis improving performance (11.7% by eliminating some purification steps). The optically active CET (1) in its natural configuration may be obtained by resolution of racemic cephalotaxine rac-CET (\u00b1)-(1) with tartaric acid, by incorporation of chiral sources, or by enantioselective synthesis. The high-purity HHT (2) used for clinical trials was obtained by extraction (NCI batches) and by semisynthesis (ssHHT) from natural CET (1) then purified by HPLC to remove impurities and minor diastereoisomers first by the French company Oncopharm SA later based in Houston (USA). A number of HHT (2) analogs were prepared; however only the monoacylated analogs 585a, 585f, and 585g showed slight increase in activity agains both hematopoietic and solid caner cell lines. The main advantage was to prepare hydrosoluble stable forms.",

HHT (2) interaction with the ribosome is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 25\n). Its six-membered aromatic ring stacks on the base of Cytosine 2452 for Haloarcula marismortui (2487 for Escherichia coli), and it fills the A-site cleft completely, the five-membered dioxolane ring attached to it. When HHT (2) is bound to the ribosome, 73% of its surface area becomes water inaccessible. The tertiary amine of HHT (2), which is protonated at neutral pH, establishes hydrogen bond with the O2 of Cytosine 2452 H. marismortui (2487 for E.coli). The hydroxyl group at the side chain forms a hydrogen bonding to the O6 of Guanine 2058 H. marismortui (2099 for E. coli) via intermediate water molecule, and the carbonyl group at the other end of the side chain establishes hydrogen bond with the N2 of Guanine 2061 for H. marismortui (2102 for E. coli). The binding of HHT (2) to the large ribosomal subunit induces several conformational changes. The most powerful of them is roughly 50 degrees reorientation of the base of Uracil 2506 for H. marismortui (2541 for E. coli), which enables it to stack on top of the drug. In the drug complex, Uracil 2506 for H. marismortui (2541 for E. coli) forms a symmetric O4\u2013N3/N3\u2013O4 base pair with Uracil 2585 for H. marismortui (2620 for E. coli). In all other crystal structures of the large ribosomal subunit from H. marismortui, Uracil 2506 for H. marismortui (2541 for E. coli) forms a Guanine\u2013Uracil base pair with G2583(2618). A number of more subtle conformational changes are seen in the A-site cleft region; C2452 of H. marismortui (2487 for E. coli) undergoes a slight rotation away from A2451 for H. marismortui (2486 for E.coli), and the base of A2453 for H. marismortui (2488 for E. coli) rotates by approximately 40 degrees about its glycosidic bond. This rotation allows A2453 for H. marismortui (2488 for E. coli) to form a base pair with U2500 H. marismortui (2535 for E. coli) and improves its stacking on C2452 for H. marismortui (2487 for E. coli).176\n",

The intrinsic pathway is induced by cleaving the proactive forms into active ones. HHT (2) activates some apoptosis mediators; it inhibits the apoptotic inhibitors and upregulates the release of other mediators through the action on genetic level. For instance apoptosis was studied in QGY-7703 cell line and 78 individual mRNAs were identified as having their transcription levels significantly changed. Those genes were mostly oncogenes, tumor suppressors, enzymes, kinases, and partially related to apoptosis, 68% being upregulated and 32% were downregulated. The following signaling apoptosis pathways were activated: TGF-\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), FAS, p38MAPK, and p53.181 The head protein of intrinsic apoptosis cascade is p53. It was activated by HHT (2) in human hepatoma QGY-7703 cells181, but cell line with p53 mutation was more resistant to HHT (2).182 A study demonstrated rapid apoptosis of U937 and HL60 cell lines on treatment with HHT (2); this was measured by increased annexin V binding capacity, caspase-3 activation, and the cleavage of poly(adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Also, the expression of Bax was upregulated during cell death induced by HHT (2), while the expression of bcl-2 was only slightly decreased.183 On treatment of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) MUTZ-1 cell lines with HHT (2), Ca2+ translocated from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool to cytosol, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Dwm) decreased, and Bid protein translocated from ER to mitochondria. Ca2+ and Bid proteins were released from ER pool to cytosol. The activation of ER stress-associated proapoptotic factor, CHOP and ER chaperones BiP and XBP1 genes, was followed by cleavage of caspase-3 but not caspase-4.184, 185\n",

Most of them were found to be related to apoptosis, oncogenes, or tumor suppression. Several genes with altered gene expression were found, such as TIEG, vitamin D3 upregulated protein one gene (VDUP1), RNA binding motif protein 4 gene (RBM4), and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (C-MYC). The activated transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and TNF\u2013signaling pathways play an important role in apoptosis according to the dynamic gene expression pattern in these apoptotic cells.

This apoptotic process was associated with the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP.206 The effect of HHT (2) was demonstrated on MM, on the following cell lines AMO-1, IM9, RPMI8226, EJM, U266, and OPM-2; HHT (2) significantly reduced Mcl-1, a crucial protein involved in myeloma cell survival, in all the myeloma cell lines that were examined. Also, HHT (2) reduced the levels of c-FLIPL/S, activated caspase-8, and induced active reduction of Bid. It follows that HHT-induced apoptosis appears to be mediated via both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. The resultant imbalance between BH3-only proteins and Mcl-1 may be pivotal for apoptosis by HHT (2). Also, HHT (2) treatment resulted in reduced levels of b-catenin and XIAP proteins, which also contribute to disease progression and resistance to chemotherapy in MM. HHT (2) enhanced the effects of melphalan, bortezomib, and ABT-737 when given in combinations with these agents. These results suggest that HHT (2) could constitute an attractive option for MM treatment through its ability to simultaneously target multiple tumor-promoting molecules.207 HHT (2) and Bortezomib synergistically inhibit SKM-1 MDS cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro.208\n",

Some mutations in this receptor (V560G, D816V, or D814Y) give it the ability of auto-dimerization and auto-phosphorylation without activation by its ligand, which can eventually lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and a resistance to apoptosis. The gain of function associated with these mutations of the KIT receptor plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SM and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The hypothesis that HHT (2), as an inhibitor of protein synthesis, decreases the protein level of KIT thereby reduces the level of phospho-KIT and repeals its constitutive signaling downstream. HHT (2) is effective both in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that it effectively inhibits tumor growth in mice and induced apoptosis of tumor cells carrying the V560G (sensitive to IM) and D816V (insensitive to IM) mutations of KIT. In addition, HHT (2) significantly prolonged the mouse survival time with aggressive SM (35 days instead of 7) though a rapid resistance to HHT (2) was observed in this case.209\n",

Ca2+ flux assay and p-IP3R (channels that most often mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores) expression found that HHT (2) retained by the H1R/CMC model increased phosphorylation of IP3R and promoted cytosolic free Ca2+ elevation in a dose-dependent manner, which further verified the activity of HHT (2) in activating H1R.

HHT (2) at 1.25 mg/m2 SC was administered (twice daily) BID, days 1\u201314 every 28 days for two cycles. This mode of administration was developed because in early clinical studies short intravenous (IV) infusions (over 60\u201390 min) was used, but life-threatening hypotension and tachycardia were observed at dose levels above 3\u20134 mg/m2.255 A stable aqueous solution for injection of HHT (2) was prepared with tartaric acid at pH around 4.256 It is only recently however that the site of protonation, although obvious, was unambiguously seen at N9 of CET (1) or HT (3) as established through X-ray diffraction studies of various organic salts,76 an observation in concordance with Steitz176 (see Fig. 25) and Takano's60 results implying that N9 should be available for protonation to ensure its biological activity. Therefore, HTs seem to be active via their protonated form. The maximum tolerated dose was estimated to be 5 mg/m2.257 It is provided in vials that contain 3.5 mg HHT (2) as a sterile, preservative-free, and white to off-white lyophilized single-use solution for injection.241 In a recent patent HHT (2) was incorporated in phycobiliprotein nanoparticles.258 HHT (2) can be given as aqueous solution preferably at a pH of about 4. Also it can be provided orally.259, 260, 261, 262, 263 The protonated form of HHT (2) was patented for potential application in oral and IV dosage forms.264\n",
