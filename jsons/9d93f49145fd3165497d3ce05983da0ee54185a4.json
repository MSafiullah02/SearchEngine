Recently, it has been observed [13] that the presence of an additional layer of WS 2 between hBN and TBG stabilizes the SC phase in a range of angles wider than reported previously. The presence of hBN breaks the in-plane two-fold rotational symmetry (C 2 ), gapping out the Dirac crossing of monolayer graphene [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] [24] [25] [26] . Placing TBG on top of hBN accounts for two coexisting moir\u00e9 patterns: that induced by the mismatch between the lattice constants of hBN and graphene [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , and that induced by the relative orientation between the two graphene layers of the TBG. If the hBN is aligned with the adjacent graphene layer and the relative twist between the two layers of graphene is close to 1 \u2022 , then the two moires have very similar periods, \u223c 13nm, even if they are not commensurate. This sensitively affects the band structure of TBG close to charge neutrality (CN). To a first approximation, it is expected that the breaking of inversion symmetry induced by the hBN layer gives rise to a gap at the Dirac point of the TBG, separating two flat conduction and valence bands, carrying opposite Chern numbers, C = \u00b11 [32, 33] . This analysis may explain the observed anomalous Hall effect at the integer band filling, \u03bd = 3 [8, 34, 35] . The existence of flat bands can lead to Chern insulators, with features similar to those found in the Quantum Hall Effect [36, 37] .",

A c = \u221a 3L 2 T BG /2 is the area of the moir\u00e9 unit cell. The presence of the substrate strongly affects the spectrum of the TBG. The flat bands at CN of the TBG become dispersive in the hBN/TBG stack, acquiring a finite bandwidth of \u223c 6 \u2212 8 meV, which is almost twice that of the TBG. As a consequence, the peak in the DOS of the TBG at CN is strongly smoothed and also split in the hBN/TBG, giving rise to an insulating structure with a small band gap, which is due to the breaking of C 2 induced by the hBN layer. The effect of a self consistent Hartree potential away from CN is shown in Fig. [3] and [4] . The Chern numbers of these bands are shown in [49] . It is worth mentioning that Chern numbers of up to C = 3 are obtained. The effect of the exchange term at the neutrality point is analysed in [49] .

This is, for example, the case for perfect alignment: \u03b8 hBN = 0 \u2022 . Because of the lack of commensuration, we cannot define a crystal momentum. In order to study the energy spectrum, we project the perturbation induced by the hBN on the low energy states of the TBG and solve a dual lattice in the reciprocal space of the TBG, as detailed in [49] . The scheme follows closely continuum models for a graphene monolayer on hBN, where the perturbation due to the hBN layer is projected onto the graphene Dirac cone. An infinite number of minibands emerge, induced by the periodicity of the poten- tial due to the hBN layer. In a similar manner, the TBG bands are replicated and coupled in our calculation. A similar method has been recently used in the Ref. [52] for studying the quasi-crystalline electronic spectrum of the non-commensurate 30 \u2022 -TBG.",

The black and red hexagons show the two different BZs of the TBG and of the hBN/G, respectively. The red lines refer to the band structure and the DOS of the unperturbed TBG, that also includes the long-wavelength staggered potential induced by the hBN, weakly breaking the C 2 symmetry of graphene (see [49] ). As is evident, the hBN strongly affects the spectrum close to CN at small angles, \u03b8 hBN < 1 \u2022 , where the moir\u00e9 identified by the TBG and that identified by the substrate of hBN have similar periods. In contrast to the narrow bands of the TBG, the hBN/TBG exhibits a broad structure, with a bandwidth of approximatively 30meV, which can even overlap with the higher energy bands. This is for example the case of \u03b8 hBN = 0.52 \u2022 , Fig. [5](b), which is close to commensuration. In addition, the band broadening at CN lowers the DOS of the hBN/TBG as compared to the sharp van Hove singularity of the TBG, that has been cut out of the energy scale in the central panels of Fig. [5] . In general, the high energy spectrum is barely affected by the hBN. Upon increasing \u03b8 hBN , the bandwidth at CN gradually shrinks, while the DOS gains intensity and the central bands further separate from the rest of the spectrum. At \u03b8 hBN = 2 \u2022 the effect of the hBN is almost completely negligible and we recover the narrow band feature of the TBG, except for a constant gap. Even though we are using a small value of the staggered potential, \u2206 = 3.62meV, as given by the Ref. [48] , we checked that our results remain valid in a wide range of values of \u2206. The details are shown in [49] , where we report the case of \u2206 = 40meV.",

TheG j are reciprocal vectors of the moir\u00e9 superlattice identified by the hBN/G, as given by: that of the freely standing TBG.

The results are shown in the Fig. S8 , for the same values of \u03b8 hBN considered in the main text. The red lines refer to the unperturbed spectrum, which indeed displays a sizeable gap at CN. As is evident, for small angles the perturbed spectrum remains gapless, in very good agreement with the Figs. 5(a)-(b) of the main text. This means that the finite wavelengths term, \u03b4V SL (r), gives the leading contribution, rather than \u2206.

(S17) finally becomes:which defines a dual tight binding multi-orbital model in the reciprocal space, where the k points act as sites, E m (k) are the onsite energies and only the overlaps between nearest neighbor sites in the triangular lattice are allowed. The corresponding hopping integrals are:Because the two moires are not commensurate, the above overlaps span ergodically the BZ of the TBG. Note that this dual tight binding framework is similar to that considered in the Ref. [52] for studying the quasi-crystalline electronic structure of the 30 \u2022 -TBG. In our calculations, for each k we consider the reduced dual model obtained by including only the 19 sites lying in the first two stars ofG vectors surrounding k, accounting for 42 overlaps. This is schematically shown in the Fig.  S7(a) , where the blue points represent the sites, the blue lines the overlaps between them, the black hexagons are the equivalent BZs of the TBG and \u03b8 hBN = 0 \u2022 . The Fig. S7(b) shows the projection of the overlaps in the first BZ of the TBG. Note that, in the commensurate case, all the neighboring sites would collapse into the same point, k, upon projection. We checked that this approximation is sufficient to achieve the convergence of the DOS. Within this framework, the spectrum at the wave vector k is obtained by diagonalizing a matrix of size (19N b where N b is the number of bands of the TBG taken into account in the projected Hamiltonian of the Eq. (S20). We consider the N b = 14 bands closest to the CN point. The multiple sets of bands shown in the left panels of the Fig. 5 of the main text arise from the diagonalization of the dual tight binding model of the Eq. (S20). Including more dual sites, there would appear many additional bands which, however, would be just replicas of the ones already shown, but shifted by a different origin in the BZ. As a consequence, they would not change appreciably the DOS and the other physical quantities, as discussed in the Ref. [52] .The parametrization of the hBN induced potential given by the Ref. [48] , Eq. (S11), accounts for a small value of the staggered potential: \u2206 = 3.62meV. This is the reason why the unperturbed band structure, obtained by neglecting \u03b4V SL (r) and shown by the red lines in the Fig. 5 of the main text, is almost gapless at CN and strongly resembles",
