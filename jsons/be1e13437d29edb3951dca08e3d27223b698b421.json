We evaluated the use of apneic oxygenation in the pediatric ED and reported a quality improvement initiative to incorporate apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during rapid sequence intubations (RSIs). Methods: A baseline period from June 2016 to April 2017 highlighted the practice gaps. Quality improvement interventions were subsequently developed and implemented as a care bundle consisting of a pre-intubation checklist, placing reminders and additional oxygen source in resuscitation bays, incorporating into the responsibilities of the airway doctor and the airway nurse (copiloting), education during airway workshops and simulation training for doctors and nurses, as well as enhancing documentation of the intubation process. We monitored a post-intervention observation period from May 2017 to April 2018 for the effectiveness of the care bundle. Results: Apneic oxygenation was not performed in all 22 RSIs during the baseline period. Among 25 RSIs in the post-intervention observation period, providers performed apneic oxygenation in 17 (68%) cases. There was no significant difference in the utilization of apneic oxygenation among emergency physicians and pediatric anesthetists performing RSIs in the pediatric ED. Conclusions: We successfully implemented a care bundle targeted at incorporating apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during emergency intubations performed in ED. This method could be adopted by other pediatric EDs to improve airway management in critically ill children.",

            "text": "Emergency airway management of critically ill children in the Emergency Department (ED) may be associated with desaturation. Unstable airway, lung pathology, altered respiratory drive, risk of aspiration, anemia, and increased metabolic demand contribute to the risk of developing desaturation. 1, 2 The incidence of desaturation during intubation has been reported to be 15% but can go up to 48% in difficult airways. 3 Complications of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest may develop following desaturation. 4, 5 Therefore, it is important to prevent desaturation during emergency airway management. Apneic oxygenation has been shown to prevent and delay desaturation during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the pediatric population. [6] [7] [8] By providing continuous high-flow oxygen via a nasal cannula to the patient after the onset of neuromuscular blockade, apneic oxygenation extends the duration of safe apneic time, which is the time following cessation of breathing until arterial desaturation occurs. In healthy pediatric patients, the safe apneic time is about 4 minutes, but critically ill pediatric patients are likely to desaturate more quickly. 9,10 Therefore, with apneic oxygenation, an oxygenation diffusion gradient between the hypopharynx and the alveoli is generated, allowing the pulmonary capillaries to continue absorbing oxygen in the absence of ventilation, thus preventing desaturation. 1,2 Furthermore, apneic oxygenation, being a noninvasive procedure, is cost-effective with no reported complications. 1, 11 However, despite the evidence for the use of apneic oxygenation in RSIs, the utilization of apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care in pediatric EDs is Pediatric Quality and Safety unknown. To address this, we evaluated the use of apneic oxygenation in a pediatric ED of a tertiary hospital. We then implemented a quality improvement initiative to incorporate apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during RSIs.",

Therefore, a setting-specific needs assessment should be carried out before deciding on which interventions should be implemented for quality improvement. Education to create awareness and change beliefs, training to equip staff with skills and procedure know-how, as well as frequent reminders and readily available references, were key elements when introducing new practices. However, the turnover of medical staff in the ED was high due to training rotations of the junior doctors. Therefore, there was a requirement for more frequent teaching sessions so that all doctors could be cognizant of and competent in this practice. Another way used to circumvent this issue was to incorporate apneic oxygenation into the roles of both airway doctor and airway nurse. This \"copiloting\" gave airway nurses the autonomy to initiate and facilitate apneic oxygenation and would significantly reduce the cognitive load of the resuscitation team leader and airway doctor. 15 Furthermore, this would help reduce noncompliance when the airway doctor was either a rotating or new physician who may be unfamiliar with apneic oxygenation or a physician (eg, anesthetist) who was not intrinsic to the department and may thus not be aware of departmental initiatives and processes.",

It is a safe and noninvasive procedure that can be performed at a minimal cost. The provision of an additional oxygen source required only minor modification to the existing setup of the resuscitation bay. The additional equipment used was already available in the department. This intervention removed the barriers of cost and training associated with the purchase of new equipment.",

Simulation provided a safe environment that was both immersive and experiential. 16 Thus, it was ideal and appropriate for recreating pediatric resuscitation scenarios involving RSI, which were infrequent and challenging for the ED team. 17 The workgroup was able to examine the process of apneic oxygenation during RSI for the simulated cases. The initial simulation allowed the establishment of safer care as problems with the interventions could be identified and addressed before implementation. This approach kept the margin of error of our care bundle to a minimum, as pediatric intubation is a high-stakes event for critically ill children and their providers. *Two patients were excluded due to concern of basilar skull fracture as this would be a contra-indication for apneic oxygenation. Finally, with the introduction of a new practice, documentation of the intubation process would require enhancement. Other than for capturing medical information in procedure documentation, this was also necessary to facilitate monitoring and audit to track the outcome and sustainability of the care bundle.",

As the study aimed to evaluate the use of apneic oxygenation and proposed a quality improvement initiative that would help EDs to incorporate apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during RSIs, we did not report on clinical correlations but focused on the practical application instead. The significant body of evidence supporting the use of apneic oxygenation allowed our work to focus on investigating the translation of evidence to clinical practice. 18, 19 Lastly, the nature of each intervention was different and would affect a different amount of time to reach stability. For instance, putting up reminders and providing an additional oxygen source could be done much faster than educating and training of all medical and nursing staff. Also, we were unable to ascertain the compliance to and hence, the effectiveness of each intervention on the outcome of interest. Also, although we have grouped our interventions and implemented them under a care bundle. We should mention that not all the interventions were always required each time an RSI was performed. For instance, the pre-intubation checklist, \"copiloting\" of airway doctor and airway nurse, as well as enhanced documentation, were core components of the care bundle for performing apneic oxygenation during RSI. However, placing reminders and additional oxygen sources were one-time interventions, while education during airway workshop and simulation training were ongoing efforts made to help achieve our aim at quality improvement.",
