Despite this armory, mucosal epithelial cells are the primary entry point for many feline viral pathogens including feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), and feline coronavirus (FCoV) (Pesavento et al., 2008, Gaskell et al., 2007, Hueffer and Parrish, 2003, De Groot and Horzinek, 1995). Infection by these viruses can disrupt or destroy the cellular or junctional barrier resulting in lesions such as ulceration or vesiculation, sloughing of epithelium, or abnormal secretion and/or absorption.",

            "text": "Many viruses target specifically receptors found on the surface of epithelial cells. Recently, feline junctional adhesion molecule-A (fJAM-A) was identified as a functional receptor for FCV (Makino et al., 2006). JAM-A localizes to junctional complexes in endothelial and epithelial cells and is important for maintaining intact mucosal epithelial barriers; in JAM-A\u2212/\u2212 mice the colonic mucosal epithelium has increased permeability to small molecules and is infiltrated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Laukoetter et al., 2007). The JAM-A molecule is not readily accessible from the apical side of polarized epithelia (Excoffon et al., 2008), therefore, an important unanswered question is how FCV gains access to the receptor. In contrast, aminopeptidase N, the receptor for feline coronaviruses, is thought to be present on the apical surface of epithelial cells (Rossen et al., 2001). The receptor for feline panleukopenia virus is the feline transferrin receptor (Parker et al., 2001), which is located on the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells (Merle et al., 2007) and previous work in canine MDCK cells showed that FPV bound sixfold more efficiently to the basolateral than the apical surface of these cells (Basak and Compans, 1989). FPV is thought to access the basolateral surface of intestinal crypt epithelial cells following systemic spread. Epithelial cells are the first cell type that feline herpesviruses encounter during infection of a new host, and while it is not known if FHV infects preferentially via apical or basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells, human herpes simplex viruses preferentially infect via the apical surface of epithelial cells (Galen et al., 2006, Hayashi, 1995, Topp et al., 1997).",

The cells were rinsed with PBS before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Post-fixation, the slides were washed twice with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST (blocking buffer) for 1 h or overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human occludin and polyclonal rabbit anti human ZO-1 were purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc., (South San Francisco, CA). A rabbit antiserum against the purified fJAM-A ectodomain was described previously (Ossiboff et al., 2007). The primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer containing either 5% normal donkey or normal goat serum and incubated for 1 h at room temperature or 4 \u00b0C overnight in a humidified chamber. Following three washes in PBST, bound antibodies were detected with Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa568-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (IgG) (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Non-immune ascites fluid (in the case of the fJAM-A antibody) and/or secondary antibody alone were used as negative controls. After three additional washes in PBST, the cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (KPL Inc., Cat#71-03-01, Gaithersburg, MD). Cover slips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and images were acquired with an Olympus FV500 series confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with argon and krypton lasers and 405 diode. Image stacks were collected on the z-axis and steps were made at the optimal voxel distance for a plan achromatic 40\u00d7 objective. Stack depths were from 5 to 8 \u03bcm using a pixel resolution of 1024 \u00d7 1024. For enhanced clarity, DAPI was pseudocolored magenta using Olympus Fluoview software.

The formation of tight junctions is a characteristic of mucosal epithelial cells. The zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) protein is a cytosolic protein that localizes to tight junctions where it is thought to form a scaffold that links the tight junction-associated transmembrane proteins to the perijunctional actin cytoskeleton. ZO-1 may also be important in transducing signals that regulate the paracellular barrier (Anderson et al., 1988). Transmembrane proteins that are found within tight junctions include claudins, occludin and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily such as junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) (for review, Shin et al., 2006).",

Similar to the distribution of ZO-1 and occludin, it was found that fJAM-A also localized to cell\u2013cell contacts in FMEC monolayers (Fig. 1D). By comparison, fJAM-A is distributed diffusely on the surface of CRFK cells (Ossiboff et al., 2007 and data not shown).",

Small molecules can also cross the epithelium through tight junctions that seal the paracellular space between epithelial cells (Schneeberger and Lynch, 2004). Tight junctions allow the selective passage of some small molecules and ions\u2014normally cations; however, this movement of ions is physiologically restricted and consequently confluent monolayers of epithelial cells that form tight junctions normally have a high TEER. To investigate the junctional permeability of the FMECs, we determined the TEER of FMEC monolayers. TEER readings were also made on CRFK cells, a feline tissue culture cell line that does not form tight junctions. Resistance readings taken over the course of 13 days after the cells were seeded showed that TEER increased in FMECs whereas TEER remained relatively unchanged in CRFK monolayers (Fig. 3\n). By day 3 after seeding, the FMEC monolayers were confluent and TEER measurements were increasing. The FMEC monolayer demonstrated a peak TEER of \u223c2000 \u03a9 cm2 by day 5 that was maintained for at least 8 days thereafter. The CRFK monolayers did not exhibit a resistance greater than 10 \u03a9 cm2 for the duration of the experiment. It is concluded that FMEC monolayers developed functional tight junctions as evidenced by the increase in TEER.",

Disruption of respiratory (FHV and FCV), oral (FHV and FCV), or enteric (feline panleukopenia virus, FCoV) epithelial function as a consequence of viral infection of epithelial cells plays a major role in the pathogenesis of these viral diseases (De Groot and Horzinek, 1995, Gaskell et al., 2007, Hueffer and Parrish, 2003, Pesavento et al., 2008). All epithelia share common properties, including morphology, expression of the cytokeratin intermediate filaments (Moll et al., 1982), and specialized connections between the cells (Gumbiner, 1996). Our current understanding of the virus:host cell interactions for feline epitheliotropic viruses relies primarily on in vitro studies of immortalized mesenchymal and monocyte cell lines and to a lesser degree on short-term primary epithelial culture (Leeming et al., 2006, Sandmeyer et al., 2005). The susceptibility of FMECs to four different feline viruses, FCV, FHV, FPV, and FCoV, were examined. The susceptibility of these cells to infection with canine parvovirus, which has been shown previously to infect feline cells and to mammalian reoviruses, which infect a broad range of mammalian cells and can use human and murine JAM-A as functional receptors were examined. It was found that FMECs supported infection by all of these viruses (Fig. 4A\u2013D and data not shown), indicating that these cells are permissive to a broad range of different virus types.",
