Virus ion channels have a highly hydrophobic domain that forms at least one amphipathic \u03b1-helix that oligomerizes to form an ion-conductive pore in membranes. Virus ion channels function to modify the cells permeability to ions and have been shown to mediate viral entry/exit or virus assembly and budding. 3, 4 The first identified viral ion channel, hence the best characterized, is the M2 protein encoded by influenza A. M2 forms proton selective ion channels that mediates viral uncoating and protects acid-sensitive hemagglutinin glycoprotein during transport to the cell surface. 5 Although influenza B does not encode the M2 ion channel, it has been demonstrated to have two ion channel forming proteins, NB and BM2, 5,6 whose role in viral replication are currently being investigated. Since the identification of the M2 ion channel, several other viruses have been demonstrated to encode viral ion channels. The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu has also been shown to have ion channel activity, which mediates the release of viral particles from the plasma membrane. 6, 7 Most recently, the 6K proteins from the alphaviruses, Ross River Virus and Barmah Forest Virus, have been shown to form cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers. 6 Additionally, several authors have shown ion channel activity of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 protein. [8] [9] [10] The M2 channel is well established as a target for antiviral drug therapy, and blockers of other viral ion channels have been shown to inhibit replication of the parent virus. The M2 ion channel is inhibited by amantadine and some of its derivates, which are currently used as clinical treatment of influenza A infection. 11, 12 The Vpu ion channel activity in planar lipid bilayers is inhibited by the amiloride derivatives 5-(N,Nhexamethylene)amiloride (HMA) and 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride (DMA), but not by amiloride itself. Furthermore, HMA inhibits Vpu enhancement of Gag-driven virus-like particles (VLP) budding from HeLa cells co-expressing Vpu and Gag and also inhibits HIV-1 replication in cultured primary human macrophages. 6 In addition, the p7 ion channel has been shown to be inhibited by HMA, amantadine, and long-alkyl chain immunosugar derivatives.
