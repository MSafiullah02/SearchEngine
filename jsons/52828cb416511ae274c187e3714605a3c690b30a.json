[1] [2] [3] [4] Excessive deep anesthesia is known to increase risk of postoperative delirium and cognitive impairment in human. [5] [6] [7] Therefore, automatic detection of BS with high accuracy would be important for anesthesia management. However, it is still insufficient. [8] [9] [10] This is especially noticeable in beagle dogs, where the suppression waves at onset of BS are often short (less than 0.5 sec) and hard to detect. 9 BS is defined as electrical pause ('suppression') alternating with high amplitude electrical activity ('Burst') and is detected as suppression ratio of a time domain EEG parameter. 11- 13 The criteria for BS are specified so that the suppression ratio does not exceed zero at anesthesia concentrations below BS level diagnosed by visual inspection. Previously, we demonstrated that suppression ratio exceeded zero even at non-BS level if the criterion of its duration was shortened. 9 Indeed, looking at an enlarged view of EEG sampled at 256 Hz in dogs (figure 1E), it is confirmed that EEG contains a number of flattish periods where there is not much variance in voltage between successive peaks.",

This indicates that CDF of shows a transition from exponential behavior to power-law behavior with BS appearance.
