Epidemiology broadly covers the study of various facets of communicable diseases in a selected population, including: transmission characteristics of diseases, epidemic and endemic states, environmental factors impacting disease transmission, and impacts of containment and prophylactic interventions (Anderson and May 1992). Epidemiology is a multidisciplinary method involving biology, biostatistics, geographic information science, social science, and computer science (Anderson and May 1992; Daley and Gani 2001). It has steadily evolved from its inception in early nineteenth century and is now a mainstream methodology that forms the corner stone for public health measures and preventive medicine (Anderson and May 1992). Epidemiological analysis enables more accurate forecasting of epidemics and aids improving efficacy of geographically targeted antiviral prophylaxis (Epstein 2009; Ferguson et al. 2006; Halloran et al. 2008; Longini et al. 2005). Nevertheless, epidemiology is an active area of research as it continues to evolve in conjunction with breakthroughs in other disciples, such as: microbiology, genetics, proteomics, and meta-genomics (Rao et al. 2007a).",

In a compartmentalized model, the sub-population that are in the same epidemic state are partitioned into non-intersecting sets called compartments (Anderson and May 1992; Daley and Gani 2001). The temporal progress of an epidemic is modeled by transitioning a suitable fraction of the population from one compartment to another (Anderson and May 1992; Daley and Gani 2001). The transition functions are typically modeled as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with time as the independent variable. Constants in the ODEs are determined based on characteristics of the disease being analyzed. A more detailed description of the compartmentalized models is presented in Sect. 8.2.1.",

            "text": "Analysis of compartmentalized epidemiological models is performed by simultaneously solving the ODEs at different time steps to obtain characteristics of the epidemic being studied (Anderson and May 1992; Daley and Gani 2001). One of the most powerful and widely used approaches for such an analysis is computer-based simulation. Simulations have gained significant importance epidemiology because they are the only practical approach to analyze large and complex epidemiological models (Epstein 2009; Ferguson et al. 2006; Halloran et al. 2008; Longini et al. 2005; Rao and Chernyakhovsky 2008). Furthermore, the need to conduct a variety of multi-faceted analysis within short time frames necessitates the use of computer-based simulations. Moreover, simulation is a cost effective and non-destructive methodology from which results can be easily displayed in an intuitive form. More importantly, it enables effective explorations of policies and procedures associated with complicated control measures, such as: targeted layered containment [the main concept behind US government\u2019s containment strategies (Halloran et al. 2008)], quarantine, social distancing, school closing, and targeted antiviral prophylaxis (Epstein 2009; Ferguson et al. 2006; Longini et al. 2005; Rao et al. 2007a).",

One strategy is to seed the simulation, i.e., manually initialize the state to appropriately model the scenario being analyzed. However, such an approach is typically tedious, cumbersome, and error prone. Moreover, in stochastic models, accurately capturing temporal, causal relationships (Lamport 1978) between entities in the model can prove to be a greater challenge. These issues often lead to conspicuous inefficiencies when multiple scenarios have to be analyzed. An alternative approach is to commence simulations in a given, verified initial state and then steer the simulations to desired scenarios of interest. Strategies for steering simulations can be broadly classified into three main categories, namely: automatic, semi-automatic, and manual steering. Note that this taxonomy is based on the degree of human involvement in the steering process.",

Manual steering of a simulation requires a human-in-the-loop (HITL) to intermittently modify the state of the simulation; thereby altering its trajectory to the desired scenario. Such HITL epidemiological bio-simulations enable efficient generation of various scenarios to be analyzed. In addition, this approach preserves the causal inter-dependencies in a stochastic model. Moreover, simulating from a validated initial state minimizes modeling errors and reduces continued verification efforts. Last but not the least, HITL steering enables some degree of adaptation and modeling of unplanned or unanticipated scenarios that could occur in emergent epidemics. Consequently, HITL-simulations hold significant potential to play a vital role in epidemiology and in establishing pertinent public policies.",

This section also reviews some of the pertinent related research investigations. Section 8.3 discusses the software architecture and design principles underlying SEARUMS. The procedure used for modeling, incorporation of real-world statistical data, and analysis using SEARUMS is presented in Sect. 8.4.

Moreover, manufacturing and distribution of vaccinations is facing multi-faceted challenges (WHO 2007a).

A Markov process consists of a number of states (or values) through which the system may transition at any given time. Mathematically, a Markov process is defined as a sequence of time dependent random variables X\n0, X\n1, X\n2, ..., where X\nt is a random variable that describes the state of the process at discrete time t. The initial or starting state of the system is typically represented by X\n0. Transitions from one state to another are governed by the following three laws: (1) a Markov process may be in only one given state at any instant of time; (2) transition from one state to another occurs instantaneously in discrete time steps; and (3) the next state to which the process transitions is purely determined by the current state of the system and not its past. In other words, the past, present, and future states of a Markov process are independent of each other (Winston 1994).",

Today, simulations are widely used in fundamental sciences, applied sciences, engineering, medicine, economics, and in the military (Tobias and Hofmann 2004). During its inception, simulations were run purely as an offline or batch processing task without requiring any interaction with a human operator. However, the growing demand and diversification in needs in various disciplines have led to the development of simulations which involve interactions with a human operator (Rao et al. 2007b). Such simulations, which permit or require a human to interact, are classified as HITL-simulations. The process of impacting the state of the simulation to divert the simulation to another state is called simulation steering. Simulation steering is similar to program steering, which is a more generic concept (Gu et al. 1994).",

The graph in Fig. 8.7 presents the impact of avian influenza outbreaks on poultry population in the continental US. Decrease in poultry population corresponds to H5N1 induced death and culling of birds to control the disease. Increase in poultry population reflects regeneration of poultry flocks after an outbreak. As illustrated by the graph, infections in poultry also follow a cyclic pattern that correlate with annual migration of waterfowl. The mortality figures can be translated to corresponding dollar figures for financial analysis.
