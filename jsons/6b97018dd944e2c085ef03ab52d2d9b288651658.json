For example, morbidity and mortality could be mitigated by a proactive regional plan for the triage of mechanical ventilators. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a resource-intensive and potentially life-saving modality in severe respiratory failure, has generally not been included in proactive disaster preparedness until recently. This article explores underlying assumptions and triage principles that could guide the integration of ECMO resources into existing disaster planning. Drawing from a collaborative framework developed by one United States metropolitan area with multiple adult and pediatric extracorporeal life support centers, this article aims to inform decision-making around ECMO use during a pandemic such as COVID-19. It also addresses the ethical and practical aspects of not continuing to offer ECMO during a disaster.",

The timing of deployment of this ECMO allocation framework will need to be flexible, incident-specific, and synchronized with the larger regional healthcare response, and likely will coincide with the appointment of an ECMO triage officer or team to advise the regional incident command system. Table 1 groups the most common indications for ECMO into three tiers based on expected outcome, with cut points at 30% and 60% approximate survival. These tiers are further divided into short or long expected duration of ECMO support, using a consensus cut point of five days.",

For example, a patient with status asthmaticus and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure (a Tier I indication with short anticipated duration of ECMO support per Table 1 ) has a favorable prognosis with ECMO support, but their prognosis has historically been favorable with mechanical ventilation as well, so in certain cases the relative benefit of ECMO over conventional support may be small. Many ECMO indications listed in Table 1 lack robust comparative effectiveness data, therefore this prognostic framework should be viewed as a starting point for resource allocation. Especially during the healthcare resource constraints of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, thoughtful patient selection remains vital to maximizing the relative benefit of ECMO for individual patients. An objective prioritization scheme employed by an impartial ECMO triage officer should complement, rather than replace, nuanced clinical judgement by a group of experienced clinicians at the bedside.",
