On-site or mobile (trailer) generators and elevated water storage can extend water service during a power failure, even if only temporarily and at a reduced level, so water systems should develop or enhance that capacity. They should also establish protocols to quickly notify customers to shed nonessential water uses, like landscape irrigation, in order to extend the system's stored water supplies during a power outage.

COVID-19, with its unprecedented impacts across multiple service sectors, renews and elevates the importance of emergency preparedness for water and wastewater utilities. Fortunately, there is no need to start from scratch, as considerable policy guidance and resources already exist. If new, more comprehensive emergency preparedness policies or regulations are warranted, the policies reviewed here are a starting point. Water and wastewater utilities should build on these resources and apply the lessons learned and perspectives gained from their COVID-19 experience in order to strengthen their preparedness for the future.",
