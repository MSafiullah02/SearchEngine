The COVID-19 was still unknown at that time but, in the first months of 2020, its outbreak has infected millions of people, killing (directly or indirectly) hundreds of thousands of them (WHO 2020) . The panic related to the pandemic distribution of the virus shut down whole regions (in China, Iran, the United States, etc.) and even entire countries (Italy, Spain, Austria, etc.) . Although it is not the worst microscopic killer humanity has ever known (for instance, think about the casualties due to the Black Death and the HIV; Wainberg et al. 2008; Haensch et al. 2010) , this coronavirus is already changing our state of mind and impacting on our lifestyle, at a global scale.",

In the last months of the virus outbreak, China has reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 25%, which means more than 200 million tons of carbon dioxide compared with emissions levels in 2019 1 . Nitrogen dioxide and smallparticle air pollution, ubiquitous in big Chinese cities in which vehicular traffic and industry are heavy, decreased about 40% 2 . A similar situation is in Pianura Padana, Italy, where satellite images of the most air-polluted European region show a drastic decrease of atmospheric contaminants in the last days 3,4 . Many airlines recently announced plans to cut flights by more than 30% globally for the next months 5 . Airplane traffic has significantly dropped worldwide and, because it accounts for about 3-5% of total GHG emissions, this change could have a major impact on the atmosphere. Similarly, forecasts for oil demand in 2020 has been lowered by energy agencies 6 because coronavirus forces people to stay at home, leave cars in the garage, reduce the shopping, and save energy and resources.

T In this scenario of a broad global spread of the COVID-19, modelling says that economic growth will be halved in 2020 7 . Despite this being bad news for world affairs, it may actually be a panacea for Gaia. It might also be true, as analysts recently suggested, that decreased travelling, consumption, and energy demand will limit money and political will from climate efforts. Then, carbon emissions are likely to rise again as soon as the economy restarts its foolish growth. Projections, however, do not take into account a life lesson we are all learning these days: we cannot stop traveling, reproducing, consuming. But we have to do it sustainably and ethically. The economy, as well as our population, cannot continue growing indefinitely in a sustainable and ethical way. The myth of sustainable development, greenwashed by the green economy and certification labels, cannot persist in a planet threatened by only one species, which created the condition for its own extinction. We can only sustainably de-grow, creating an open space only for qualitative growth.",

The ability to predict the ecological consequences of the way we manage natural resources is now essential to address policies and decision-making. Although in the past, ecological models did not often contribute to such predictions (Schuwirth et al. 2019) , there is now urgency to use them for practical applications. The current Figure 1 .

Nowadays, humanity has available several modelling approaches (e.g. machine learning, mechanistic and statistical models, etc.) that can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic impacts (Getz et al., 2018) . Nonetheless, theoretical models unsupported by empirical data and field validation frequently led to either poor predictability or over parameterization, which resulted in catastrophic Nature degradation and misunderstanding about the actual utility of ecological models (Pilkey and Pilkey-Jarvis 2007) .",

They should, instead, improve model elaboration to align them with the management decision-making, quantifying uncertainty, in order to have enough predictive performance. Similarly, advanced computing resources should not be wasted in purposeless data exploration. They should, instead, increase the sensitivity and validity of our analyses, to better understand the adequacy and importance of models in improving forecasting, solving management problems, and advancing theories.",

Improved and reliable ecological models can, for instance, help our species to better protect biodiversity and halt its loss, plan habitat and endangered species conservation, assess and preserve ecosystem services, manage and contrast the spread of alien species, decrease deforestation and overfishing, reduce air, water, and soil pollution, adapt to and limit climate change, and -eventually -enhance our species' health, reducing the risk of pandemic diffusion of resistant viruses and bacteria caused by our mistreatment of wildlife and ecosystems. This can re-establish the importance of ecological modelling in fostering the transfer of theoretical scientific knowledge into practical everyday problems and in enabling environmental policymakers to adopt sustainable actions.",
