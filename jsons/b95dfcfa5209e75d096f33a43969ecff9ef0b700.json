Results of past investigations have suggested that age may be a factor in producing differences in sensitivity of the CF and HAl tests; CF was found to be most sensitive when the population studied was composed of adults [9] , and HAl was most sensitive when the population was made up exclusively of children [4] . The ages of individuals who exhibited the rises in titer were therefore examined, showed rises in antibody by CF and HAl were tested by neutralization. They were selected randomly from within individual respiratory years so that all periods would be represented; the respiratory year has been defined as extending from September to the following August and is identified by the date in which most of the year fell. Results are given in table 2. Period of collection was the most important predictor of presence or absence of rise in titer of neutralizing antibody. Since the 1966 and 1969 periods, on the one hand, and the 1967 and 1968 periods, on the other, resembled each other, they have been combined. In serum pairs in which the second specimen was collected in 1967 and 1968, and in which there was a rise in CF titer alone, no rises in titers of neutralizing antibody were found. In the pairs from this period with a rise in HAl antibody, there was an occasional rise in titer of neutralizing antibody, and among the few pairs showing an increase in titer by both CF and HAl, 28.6% had a rise in titer by neutralization. The situation with the 1966 and 1969 specimens was quite different. The specimens with rises in CF or HAl titer both showed 66.7% agreement with the neutralization test. All specimens with a combined CF and HAl increase also had a rise in titer by neutralization. Thus, the 1966 and 1969 period was distinct from the 1967 and 1968 period in having not only more frequent combined CF and HAl rises in antibody titer, but also because all rises in antibody titer were more likely associated with rises in neutralization titer.

To complete the study of these families the blood specimens collected on filter paper disks from the younger children were also tested by CF and HAl against OC43 antibody. Persons were identified as infected if they had a significant increase in antibody titer by CF or HAl test, since during the period both were equally likely to agree with the neutralization test. The results, shown in table 3, calculated on the basis of person-years of observation, indicate the great frequency of infection with the agent.
