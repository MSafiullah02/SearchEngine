The concept of transparency can be represented by the extent of civil liberties and the circulation of public information [16]. Civil liberties are the basic tenets of democracy that indicating the rights and freedoms which protect individuals from unfair infringement by the government of the nation where they reside [16]. Civil liberties further set limits on the government from abusing their power and interfering unduly with the affairs of private citizens. Countries with strong civil liberties typically also have well-developed mass media that is capable of reporting news regarding infectious disease control. With personal safety and security, there would be better space for public supervision for government movement [20]. Therefore, the countries\u2019 self-evaluation and external evaluation would be more accurate based on accountable information, and the gap between countries\u2019 self-evaluation and JEE would be smaller.",

The JEE is scored on a scale from 1 to 5 to represent the level of a countries\u2019 capacity to meet an indicator of health security, with 5 being the highest level of capacity. In order to make the IHR and JEE scores comparable, we re-scored the IHR results by dividing the scores by 20 to condense the scores into the scale of 5. We then calculated the difference of average score of each item between IHR self-evaluation and JEE to represent the gap between the different evaluation approaches. And the gap is further divided into 2 groups (less gap v.s. big gap) with average as cutting point. Similarly, the score gap between IHR 2016 and IHR 2017 is divided into 3 groups (negative gap, no gap, positive gap) for further analysis. The negative gap groups refers to countries with lower IHR 2017 scores than IHR 2016.",

There is also a possibility that countries downgraded their IHR scores due to the pressure of external evaluation. While the external experts will review their capacity on-site, countries might consider reducing the over-report of appropriate behaviors. The changing nature of financing health security, especially insufficient financing in preparedness, might also be the reason for the changes of the score.
