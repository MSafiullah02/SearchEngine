PCR technology could allow for non-invasive sampling methods. Objective: Evaluate the utility of non-invasive sample collection using anterior nare swabs and facial tissues for respiratory virus detection by multiplex PCR. Study design: Children aged 1 month-17 years evaluated in a pediatric emergency department for respiratory symptoms had a swab, facial tissue, and NPA sample collected. All samples were tested for respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR. Viral detection rates were calculated for each collection method. Sensitivity and specificity of swabs and facial tissues were calculated using NPA as the gold standard. Results: 285 samples from 95 children were evaluated (92 swab-NPA pairs, 91 facial tissue-NPA pairs). 91% of NPA, 82% of swab, and 77% of tissue samples were positive for \u2265 1 virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) were most common. Overall, swabs were positive for 74% of virus infections, and facial tissues were positive for 58%. Sensitivity ranged from 17 to 94% for swabs and 33 to 84% for tissues. Sensitivity was highest for RSV (94% swabs and 84% tissues). Specificity was \u226595% for all viruses except HRV for both collection methods.

Testing serves several functions, including facilitating patient cohorting, 4 initiation of antiviral therapy, 5 containment of nosocomial outbreaks, 6 and decreased use of ancillary testing 7, 8 and antibiotics. [8] [9] [10] In most cases, respiratory samples are collected by invasive methods such as nasopharyngeal swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and diagnostics are performed using immunofluorescence and/or culture-based methods. 11 Increased sensitivity has been demonstrated with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 12, 13 and the use of PCR diagnostics in hospitals has increased. 11 Diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses is also important for surveillance and epidemiologic studies performed in both hospital and community settings. Throughout the year, multiple respiratory viruses co-circulate and can cause similar clinical syndromes that cannot be distinguished without diagnostic testing. 14, 15 Recent studies of non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent the spread of influenza have highlighted the need for large-scale, community-based epidemiologic data, including specific laboratory-confirmed diagnosis. 16 PCR-based methods have enabled investigators to perform family-based studies of viral prevalence in the community. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Invasive respiratory sample collection methods for respiratory testing have significant limitations for community studies. 22 The performance of a nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab test is stressful, leading to reluctance among children and parents to participate in studies, particularly if repeated testing is required. Based on the higher sensitivity of PCR, we hypothesized that respiratory viruses could be detected from samples collected by non-invasive methods that might be more acceptable to children such as anterior nare swabs or facial tissues.

In studies where large groups or repeated sampling is involved, facial tissue might be a more practical and acceptable method for obtaining specimens.

The reasons for this are unclear, but could be due to virus or symptomrelated factors that would require further investigation. [32] [33] High specificity for detection of viruses is crucial for surveillance, as it provides confidence that a detected virus is circulating in a population. Some current methods for influenza surveillance are not virus-specific and are performed, for example, in schools through absenteeism data and through sentinel clinics by influenza-like illness (ILI) reporting. Absenteeism can be due to a number of factors unrelated to influenza, 34, 35 and the specificity of ILI for culture-proven influenza has been shown to range from 35 to 71%. 15, [36] [37] [38] Use of non-invasive sampling methods combined with molecular detection could offer the potential to broaden population-based testing with the possibility of a significant improvement in data. In other studies of infectious pathogens, non-invasive collection methods combined with molecular detection has improved epidemiologic understanding.
