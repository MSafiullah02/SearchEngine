Syndactyly results when the mesenchyme between radial swellings of the hand or footplate of the developing extremity fails to break down. As a result, there is incomplete separation of skin, fibrous tissue and/or bone in utero (Noden and de Lahunta 2003, 1985, 1987).",

In simple syndactyly, the abnormal interconnection between adjacent digits consists only of skin and fibrous tissue, whereas in complex syndactyly there is a lack of separation of adjacent bone(s), in addition to skin and fibrous tissue deformities. Syndactyly is called complete when adjacent digits (phalanges 1 to 3) are connected throughout their entire length with soft tissue and/or bone and incomplete when they are not connected throughout their entire length (Ger 2004, 1998, 2003). All cases in the veterinary literature with complex syndactyly have a complete simple syndactyly. Complex syndactyly is further classified as complicated or uncomplicated. Complicated complex syndactyly is associated with other anomalies whereas uncomplicated complex syndactyly is not associated with other anomalies (Kozin 2003). This classification has also been used for syndactyly feline and canine patients (1, 2) (Towle and Breur 2004).",

The mode of transmission of familial syndactyly is considered to be autosomal dominant with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. This means that syndactyly in human beings is propagated in family lines, may not be present in full form in each patient (phenotypic variation) and may skip a generation (Kozin 2003). It is also associated with defects of the second chromosome (Kozin 2003). Syndactyly in human beings has been associated with a mutation of the homeobox D cluster\u201013 (Hoxd\u201013) gene, fibroblast growth factor receptors, ligand Wnt\u20101 and transcription factor Msx\u20102 (Daluiski and others 2001, Arias and Stewart 2002, 2003). In human beings, complicated complex syndactyly is seen in association with symbrachydactyly (Poland syndrome), constriction bands and acrocephalosyndactyly (Apert syndrome) (Kozin 2003).",

Dissection of feline syndactyle legs demonstrated that deep digital flexor muscles to fused digits were often absent (Howe 1917, 1902). In general, the musculature corresponded to the skeletal anomalies, for example, fused digits corresponded to single\u2010muscle units and some muscles were lacking in entirety. Radiographic findings consisted of complete or incomplete joining of phalanges 1 to 3 and metacarpal or metatarsal bones (Howe 1975, 1917, 1902, 1953). Both the external and radiographic features of feline syndactyly are similar to those of canine complex syndactyly.

Both males and females were affected. It was concluded that ectrodactyly combined with syndactyly was due to the action of a heterozygous gene with a variable expression. In another report, syndactyly was reported in a colony of polydactyle cats (Howe 1902). Although the incidence of syndactyly in this colony was not reported, it may be that syndactyly was an inherited trait, just like polydactyly (Howe 1902). In the present report, environmental and family histories were not available. However, because four of the six kittens in the litter were affected, a genetic background for the syndactyly is not unlikely (Thrusfield 1988, Patterson and others 1989). Thus, it may be that almost all reported feline syndactyly cases have a genetic aetiology.",

Because syndactyly may be a hereditary trait, a detailed history with questions about syndactyly in littermates and previous litters (including male:female ratio) and other related cats should be obtained. Information on drug exposure, maternal disease or radiation exposure during the first and second trimester of gestation should be collected to determine possible causative environmental factors (Towle and Breur 2004). The clinician should perform a thorough general physical examination to detect other congenital anomalies. The paws should be carefully examined for abnormal or absent digits, abnormal shape, fusion or absence of digital pads and abnormal shape or fusion of nails. Radiographic changes may be dramatic and can include complete or incomplete fusion of phalanges and metatarsal or metacarpal bones. The diagnosis of complex syndactyly is based on clinical and radiographic findings. It appears that feline complex syndactyly causes minimal to no discomfort and reported patients affected with this condition have presented without lameness. Therefore medical or surgical treatment of this condition is not recommended. Because the condition may be hereditary, breeding of affected animals should be discouraged and it is recommend that affected animals be neutered or spayed.",
