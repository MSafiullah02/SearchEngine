However, TRAF6 was found to be suppressed by phosphorylation. Mechanistically, the mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 4 (MST4) catalyzes TRAF6 Thr463 and Thr486 phosphorylation in THP1 cells, leading to attenuated oligomerization and ubiquitination of TRAF6, as well as reduced production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [33] (Fig. 2) . TBK1 undergoes self-association and autophosphorylation at Ser172 after being recruited to the TRAF3 complex upon RNA virus infections, a process in which glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B) functions as an important physical partner [34, 35] . By contrast, the phosphatase PPM1B removes TBK1 autophosphorylation to eliminate downstream IRF3 activation and IFN-\u03b2 production in HEK293T cells [36] (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) negatively regulates antiviral responses by inducing TBK1 Ser527 phosphorylation and subsequent K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation in HEK293 cells [37] (Fig. 2) .

IRF3 is reported and TRIF are K48-linked ubiquitinated by Nrdp1 and WWP2 respectively, and then they are sequestered to proteolytic degradation. TRAF6 are inhibited by A20, CYLD and OTUB2 that specially remove TRAF6 K63-linked ubiquitination. TRAF3 are inhibited by DUBA, OTUB1 and UCHL1 that specilally remove TRAF3 K63-linked ubiquitination. TRAF3 are also targeted for proteolytic degradation by Triad3-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination. MAVS is activated by TRIM31-medited K63-linked ubiquitination. RNF5, MARCH5, ITCH and Smurf1/2 catalyze MAVS K48-linked ubiquitination and induce MAVS degradation by protease. TRIM44 removes ITCH-induced K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS and thus promotes RIG-I signaling. TRIM32 and TRIM56 promote cGAS signaling by catalyzing K63-linked ubiquitination of STING. RNF5 catalyzes STING K48-linked ubiquitination and promotes proteolytic degradation of STING. RNF26 catalyzes STING K11-linked ubiquitination and inhibit STING degradation. AMFR catalyzes STING K27-linked ubiquitination and promotes STING activation. TRIM23 promotes NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation by adding K27linked ubiquitinatin chain to NEMO. HOIL-1L/HOIP and TRAF7 promote NF-\u03baB signaling by catalyzing NEMO linear and K29-linked ubiquitination respectively. Nrdp1 and RNF128 catalyzing TBK1 K63-linked ubiquitination and thus promoting TBK1 activation. DTX4 induces TBK1 proteolytic degradation by adding K48-linked ubiquitin chain to it.

The NS1 encoded by human, avian, swine and mouse-adapted influenza viruses can bind with human TRIM25 and inhibit TRIM25-catalyzed RIG-I ubiquitination [132] . However, the NS1 from mouse-adapted influenza viruses targets RNF135, but not TRIM25, to inhibit RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitination, which indicates a species divergence between human and mice influenza infections and immune responses [132] . The papillomaviruses induce expression of the cellular protein ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) in keratinocytes, which inhibits TRAF3 K63-linked ubiquitination and subsequent IRF3 phosphorylation, as well as IFN-\u03b2 expression [67] . UCHL1 also promotes K48-linked ubiquitination of NEMO, leading to attenuated proinflammatory cytokines production [67] . In addition, a large number of viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, human coronavirus NL63, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), HBV, Epstein-Barr virus and some arteriviruses, have been shown to block IFN-\u03b2 production by encoding DUB motif-containing proteins [133, 134] . Given the distinct functions of ubiquitination in the same or different signaling proteins, further investigation is urgent to characterize how these virus DUB-containing proteins interact with target proteins and remove the \"bad\" type of ubiquitin chains on specific residues. Apart from ubiquitination, the Ebola Zaire virus dampens IRF7 activity and IFN-\u03b2 transcription via VP35, which increases PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation of IRF7 and thus impairs the recruitment of IRF7 to type I IFN gene promoters [135] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 557, "end": 562, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 797, "end": 802, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1172, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1551, "text": "[133,", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1556, "text": "134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2068, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PTMs in virus related immune disorders and therapy"}, {"text": "The idea of PAMPs and PRRs was started two decades ago [136] .

More detailed genetic and biochemical evidence is also needed for a full understanding of PTM role in antiviral responses. Moreover, while multiple kinases and E3 ligases contributing to IFN-\u03b2 production are identified, not much is known about the phosphatases and deubiquitinating enzymes which functions as IFN-\u03b2 production brake. Though insufficient interferon production may cause chronic infections, excessive interferon production often causes autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases such as Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, arthritis and influenza pneumonia.
