In allogeneic HSCT patients who develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality rates often exceed 80% and 85%, respectively [2\u20135]. The factors that contribute to the development of pulmonary complications in these patients include immunologic defects due to the underlying disease and its treatment, conditioning regimens, development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and the type of HSCT [2, 6, 7]. The spectrum of pulmonary complications in patients with hematological malignancy and HSCT recipients is changing because of recent advances in antineoplastic therapies, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies and other targeted agents, increased application of HSCT for older patients, widespread use of prophylactic antibiotics and novel antimicrobial agents, and advances in supportive care [8].",

Unfortunately, despite the technological advances in diagnostic testing and imaging modalities, obtaining an accurate clinical diagnosis in these patients remains difficult and at times is made only at the time of the postmortem autopsy examination. Autopsy rates in cancer patients are much lower (13\u201334%) as compared to general medical and surgical patients (53\u201364%) [7\u20139]. This probably reflects the unwillingness on the part of physicians and family members to subject the cancer patient to the same level of scrutiny applied to other major illnesses in determining the primary and contributory causes of death [9].

Patients with hematologic malignancies, especially in the neutropenic state after aggressive chemotherapy or HSCT and HSCT recipients with GVHD, are particularly susceptible to invasive fungal infections [13]. Approximately 20\u201350% of patients with hematological malignancies and HSCT recipients have evidence of invasive fungal infections at autopsy [8].

Several autopsy studies in HSCT recipients have shown that IPA is frequently not diagnosed antemortem or persistent despite diagnosis by sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures or by serum galactomannan assay and treatment with amphotericin B [8, 15\u201321].

However, its temporal relation with neutrophil recovery suggests that it may be caused by IRIS. The patients who died during the first month had no evidence of aspergillosis at autopsy.

HSCT recipients who received conditioning regimens with total body irradiation and patients treated with chemotherapy regimens containing high-dose cytarabine or an anthracycline have an increased risk of developing invasive disease. In recent years, there has been an increase in bloodstream infections caused by non-albicans Candida species such as Candida glabrata and C. krusei.

DAD has been reported at autopsy in 63.5% of patients with treated leukemia and lymphoma and close to 50% among HSCT patients [7, 8]. Infections as the cause of DAD are identified on autopsy in only a third of HSCT patients, while approximately 20% have DAH. In over 50% of patients with DAD, no etiology is determined, and these patients are considered as having idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). It is possible that empirically treated previous infections could have caused the histological changes noted in patients classified as having IPS.

            "text": "Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the acute onset of alveolar infiltrates, bloody bronchoalveolar lavage, and hypoxemia in the absence of infection [1, 40]. The incidence of DAH ranges from 1\u20135% to 3\u20137% in autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients, respectively [41\u201343]. A few case reports have been described in patients with acute leukemia more commonly in association with chemotherapy [44\u201346]. DAH has also been described in patients undergoing an umbilical cord HSCT [47, 48]. The majority of patients with DAH develop severe respiratory failure with high mortality rates. Vascular damage and inflammation from chemotherapy and radiation therapy used in the conditioning regimen and immune-mediated events including GVHD have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DAH [41, 43, 49]. Wojno et al. reported that 41% of 37 allogeneic HSCT patients who underwent autopsies had extensive pulmonary hemorrhage, which was thought to have led to severe respiratory failure and death [49]. These patients were subdivided into those with significant acute GVHD and those without. Of the patients with acute GVHD, 59% died of acute respiratory failure secondary to DAH compared with 25% of those without GVHD. Pulmonary hemorrhage was also independently found to be associated with pre-transplant total body irradiation. Although pulmonary and systemic infections cause alveolar damage through similar mechanisms [50]. infection-associated alveolar damage has traditionally been excluded from analyses of DAH. Autopsy studies have shown that pulmonary infections are frequently underdiagnosed in HSCT recipients; thus, patients with alveolar hemorrhage and underlying undetected infections can be misclassified as having DAH [7, 8, 51].",

            "text": "Autopsy studies show that pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) infrequently complicates the course of patients with acute leukemia and severe thrombocytopenia, and HSCT recipients with an incidence rate ranging from 1% to 6.3% [8]. [60] Patients with acute leukemias commonly have clinically silent haemostatic abnormalities, but some may show clinical manifestations, including venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and life-threatening thrombohemorrhagic syndrome. The pathogenesis of PTE is complex and multifactorial and may involve tumor cell-derived procoagulant, fibrinolytic or proteolytic factors, and inflammatory cytokines, which affect clotting activation. Chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs also increase the thrombotic risk in patients with lymphoma, acute leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Infectious complications are another important factor: endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria induce the release of tissue factor (TF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1 (IL-1), and gram-positive organisms can release bacterial mucopolysaccharides that directly activate factor XII. Needleman et al. reviewed 80 consecutive autopsies in leukemia patients and found three patients with previously undiagnosed PTE, all of whom had been severely thrombocytopenic. However, Candida forms were abundant in the thromboemboli in all three patients, with some containing septate hyphal forms consistent with Mucor or aspergillosis. No vessel wall invasion or necrosis was noted, and fungus was not shown to be present in pulmonary vessels in segments of the lung not involved with thromboembolism [60]. Leukemic patients may also be affected by other prothrombotic factors, including hyperleukocytosis, increased TF expression and activation, and the prothrombotic properties of therapeutic agents, such as all-trans retinoic acid and L-asparaginase, which can induce thrombosis involving multiple organs. A higher index of suspicion may lead to the diagnosis, but the signs and symptoms of PTE in patients with hematologic malignancy are variable and nonspecific as with PTE in other populations.",

[61, 62] In one autopsy series, Sharma et al. reported on 71 patients who had undergone HSCT, of whom 3% had BO and 1% had BOOP [8]. Unusual histological variants have also been described, including a case report of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia following HSCT in a patient with AML [63] characterized by prominent intraalveolar fibrin deposition and organizing pneumonia. The radiographic presentation revealed patchy consolidation in the lower lobes and a diffuse miliary pattern. Clinically, these cases can have subacute presentations similar to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or have more rapid progression with clinical features similar to ARDS. BOOP and BO are rare autopsy findings, which may be because infections are being treated aggressively, and often patients not responding to antibiotics and with no clinical evidence of infections are given a trial of corticosteroids.",

Secondary PAP is frequently noted among patients with hematologic malignancies who develop fungal infection, especially pulmonary aspergillosis. KL-6 protein is produced by type II alveolar pneumocytes and can be helpful in establishing an early diagnosis of PAP [74, 76]. The standard therapy for PAP with hematological malignancy has not yet been firmly established. The administration of GM-CSF has been suggested to activate the alveolar macrophages and increase the rate of surfactant clearance [73]. Case reports indicate that the prognosis of PAP with leukemia is very poor because of the high frequency of superinfections in the affected alveoli [73, 75].",

[77] The majority of major discrepancies were due to complications of the cancer itself or its treatment (such as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute hemorrhage, and pulmonary embolism) rather than infection. Pastores et al. reported a major missed diagnosis rate of 26% in 86 autopsies performed on cancer patients who died in a medical-surgical ICU [78]. Of the 86 patients, 25 (40%) had undergone HSCT, 18 (29%) had either leukemias or lymphomas, 19 (31%) had solid tumors, and 24 (28%) were surgical cancer patients. Among the patients with discrepancies 54% had class I discrepancies, 32% had class II discrepancies, and 14% had both class I and class II discrepancies. Of the 22 discordant cases, 6 had hematological malignancies and 4 underwent HSCT. Opportunistic infections due to viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasitic organisms and cardiac complications were the most common class I discrepancies. The majority of Class II discrepancies were accounted for by cardiopulmonary complications due to pulmonary embolism and thrombotic endocarditis. The study was limited by the retrospective study design and selection bias that may have occurred as physicians and family members of patients with premortem diagnostic uncertainty would have been more likely to pursue an autopsy. Xavier et al. reported a class I discrepancy rate of 31.3% in 118 autopsies of patients with hematological malignancies or severe aplastic anemia [79]. The most common diagnoses causing these discrepancies were hematological disease, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Class I discrepancies were more common in elderly patients (>64 years) and in patients who had not received previous specific treatment for the hematological malignancy, had not been treated with bone marrow or peripheral blood HSCT, or had not been treated in a specialized hematology unit. Seftel et al. reported a discrepancy rate of 64% (34% major, 30% minor) in 48 autopsies of patients who underwent HSCT (blood and bone marrow) [82]. Infectious complications, including pulmonary aspergillosis, candidiasis, and infective endocarditis, accounted for the majority of the major discrepancies. Hoffmeister et al. found a 26% discrepancy rate (4% major, 23% minor) in 111 autopsies of patients who had undergone HSCT [83]. In contrast, Al Saidi et al. found a significant concordance between the clinical and postmortem diagnoses in 28 critically ill HSCT patients [15]. Ten (36%) of the twenty eight patients had discrepancies uncovered on autopsy; only two discrepancies would have influenced patient management, and none would have altered patient outcome. Most of the unexpected diagnoses were infections, and the rest included non-infective endocarditis, GVHD, and gastrointestinal and neurologic diagnoses. The authors concluded that clinical diagnosis alone might be appropriate for withdrawal of care decision-making in these patients.",

Despite the technological advances in diagnostic testing and imaging modalities, obtaining an accurate clinical diagnosis remains difficult and is often not possible until autopsy. Major diagnostic discrepancies between clinical premortem diagnoses and postmortem autopsy findings have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancy. The most common missed diagnoses are due to opportunistic infections and cardiopulmonary complications. These findings underscore the importance of enhanced surveillance, monitoring, and treatment of infections and cardiopulmonary disorders in these patients. Autopsies remain important in determining an accurate cause of death and for improved understanding of diagnostic deficiencies, as well as for medical education and quality assurance.",

Minor discrepancies included two categories (class III referred to missed minor diagnoses related to the terminal disease process but not directly related to the cause of death, and class IV referred to missed minor diagnoses that did not contribute to the cause of death but ultimately may have been significant had the patient survived the major illness)",
