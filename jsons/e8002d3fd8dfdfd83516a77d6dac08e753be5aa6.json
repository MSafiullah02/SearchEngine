The structure of this genetic diversity, and whether it reveals epidemiological insights, are fundamental questions for understanding the evolutionary trajectory of this virus. Here we use a recently developed phylodynamic approach to uncover phylogenetic structures underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We find support for three SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating, each with significantly different demographic dynamics concordant with known epidemiological factors. For example, Lineage C emerged in Europe with a high growth rate in late February, just prior to the exponential increase in cases in several European countries. Mutations that characterize Lineage C in particular are non-synonymous and occur in functionally important gene regions responsible for viral replication and cell entry. Even though Lineages A and B had distinct demographic patterns, they were much more difficult to distinguish. Continuous application of phylogenetic approaches to track the evolutionary epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 lineages will be increasingly important to validate the efficacy of control efforts and monitor significant evolutionary events in the future.",

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified infecting humans. The closest relatives (RaTG13 and RmYN02, 96% and 93% nucleotide identity respectively) derive from the Intermediate Horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) and the Malayan Horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus malayanus) 2 , although the original host is yet to be conclusively identified 3 . Since spilling over to humans, the virus has diverged rapidly, but it is unclear whether these mutations have resulted in SARS-CoV-2 lineages with different epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Several lineages have been highlighted for potential significance [4] [5] [6] 9 . For consistency, we adopt the nomenclature outlined in 8 which classifies the initial lineages as A and B (previously labelled 'S' and 'L' 4 ). There is some evidence that Lineage A is ancestral to the more recent Lineages B 8 , even though the earliest assembled genomes from December 2019 belong to Lineage B 4, 8 . Sequences within Lineage A and the closest known bat virus share two nucleotides in ORF1ab and ORF8 genes that are not found in Lineage B 8 . More recently, a new lineage 'G' 6 has been documented originating Europe in February 6 . For consistency we call this Lineage C. It is currently unclear if these lineages differ phenotypically, or whether these lineages show distinctive demographic signatures (i.e., diversity increasing, plateauing or declining). Any further population sub-structure within these three lineages is also unknown at this point.",

Non-synonymous mutations in ORF14 (28881-3) also partially define these lineages. However, there is a high degree of phylogenetic uncertainty about the node representing their most recent common ancestor and this lineage may be polyphyletic (Fig. 1, Fig. S1 ). Soon after diverging from Lineage A, the growth rate of Lineage B was at its highest but then formed a pattern of peaks and troughs with the credible interval including zero (representing no growth) from January onwards (Fig.   2b ). The peak growth rate coincided with that of Lineage A (Fig. 2) indicating that this first wave of SARS-CoV-2 through China generated a relatively large amount of the genetic diversity. As many sequences classified in Lineage B originate from China ( Fig. 1 ) the subsequent decline of this lineage may also be linked to control of the virus. There is also evidence for a spike in growth rate of both Lineage A and Lineage B when spread increased outside of China and this coincides with the divergence date for Lineage C (Fig. 2 ).",

This lineage was well supported as monophyletic (node posterior support = 0.99, 91% bootstrap support, Fig. 1 ) and diverged from Lineage B in late January (95% HPD late Januaryearly February). Linked non-synonymous mutations differentiated this lineage in the S gene (sites 23402-04) and ORF1ab (14407-09) regions. The mutations in the ORF1ab gene alter the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) that are crucial for the replication of RNA from the RNA template. There is evidence that this RdRp mutation may increase the mutation rate of the virus overall by reducing copy fidelity 7 . The growth rate of Lineage C was initially high in late February, prior to the rapid increase of cases in Europe, but then declined, with one further peak around February 27, although the short duration suggests this may not be significant and could represent sampling noise. Accordingly, the effective population size of Lineage C increased rapidly during February -March, whereas there was only a small increase estimated for Lineage A and a decline in Lineage B (Fig. 2 ).",

Given the potential significance of the RdRp and spike gene mutation and subsequent rapid expansion across the globe, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mutations in Lineage C have increased transmissibility compared to the other lineages 6 . However, our results on their own can not rule out the possibility that the expansion of this lineage was the result of a founder effect 6 (i.e., the rapid expansion of Lineage C was because it was the first broadly transmitted in Europe). More analysis of these co-circulating lineages at a local level would be required to evaluate the relative fitness of the lineages.",

It appears that this increase is not distributed evenly across the phylogeny, with all lineages showing some evidence of decline at different times. However, there is bias in countries represented in the GISAID dataset we accessed, with, for example, no sequences in our dataset from the Middle East even though there was a significant (and ongoing) outbreak in this region. Even though the outbreak is only months old at the time of writing, there is already sufficient genetic diversity to track the demographic trajectories of each lineage. Approaches such as the one presented here, combined with workflows quantifying geographical lineage dispersal 17 , will be even more useful in the coming months to assess the longer-term impacts on SARS-CoV-2 control measures across the globe.

For the BEAST analysis, as there is strong evidence that the pandemic is growing, we assumed an exponential growth coalescent model. Preliminary analyses revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in evolutionary rate estimates using either a strict or relaxed molecular clock. Thus, we assumed a strict molecular clock and used uninformative continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) reference prior to estimate substitution rate across time.
