Modelling strategies circumvent some of the limitations of traditional populationbased surveillance studies because they do not rely on direct linkage of exposure and outcome data at an individual level, but indirectly assess the effect of pathogens on the rates of health outcomes of interest. \u25aa Using data from large, nationally representative databases over an extended period encompassing 14 seasons, our study provides recent estimates of the RSV-attributable burden of general practitioner episodes, hospitalisations and deaths due to respiratory disease, by age. \u25aa Other strengths include the use of individual patient data for defined outcomes, and a relatively broad definition of respiratory disease to increase sensitivity while maintaining specificity. Furthermore, we report novel data on antibiotic prescribing attributable to RSV. \u25aa The study may be limited by the assumption of a constant seasonal baseline and a sinusoidal pattern of seasonal outcomes. Patients who did not seek care and changes in coding practices or in the quality of diagnoses recorded in the databases over time could not be accounted for in our model. Age groups used for the analysis were not optimal for assessing RSV as they were originally defined for the purpose of assessing the influenza burden. RSV risk stratified by gestational age could not be assessed. \u25aa The inclusion of cyclic terms in the model to account for other winter seasonal pathogens for which weekly incidence data were not available reduced the possibility that the study overestimated the RSV burden.",

Assessing the total health burden of RSV is crucial to setting appropriate prevention and resource allocation strategies and to make the case for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.",

Multiple regression time-series modelling is one such method which has frequently been used for the assessment of an infectious disease burden. [6] [7] [8] We used time-series regression methods to analyse the available data and estimate the RSV-attributable medical burden among children in the UK in terms of GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths due to respiratory diseases and other outcomes, by age, for the period 1995-2009.

Patients included in the study were registered at \u223c500 distinct practices. All diagnoses and patient interventions are summarised and stored as READ codes. The READ system generally maps onto International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, with one or more READ codes per ICD code and additional non-ICD diagnostic codes for presenting symptoms which are widely used in primary care to describe minor illness. Under the guidance of two experts, we defined sets of READ codes corresponding to ICD codes of interest (ICD codes summarised in table 1; READ  equivalents available on request) . In addition, preliminary searches of the CPRD dictionary were made to assess the frequency of symptom and other diagnostic codes used during three influenza peak periods, and the frequency in periods in which influenza did not circulate. This procedure revealed codes used by GPs to code patients who present with symptoms of acute respiratory infection during periods of influenza (and by extension RSV) activity.",

While the highest incidences of RSV-attributable GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths were in infants <6 months of age, the burden of GP episodes remained high until 4 years of age. Indeed, around 36% of GP episodes for RSV-attributable respiratory disease occurred in children 2-4 years of age. As well as acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis, which are well-recognised clinical syndromes associated with RSV infection in children, between 6.3% (5-17 years old) and 13.0% (2-4 years old) of otitis media was also attributed to RSV in our study. This is consistent with studies that assessed viral pathogens in middle ear fluid, which have frequently identified RSV as the infectious agent in children with otitis media. [12] [13] [14] Our study points to a large burden in terms of GP episodes for RSV-associated otitis media in children of all ages, particularly in children aged <5 years. Moreover, RSV infection was associated with substantial antibiotic use in the community; there were an average 416 000 prescribed antibiotic courses per season. These results indicate that RSV infection in children constitutes a major health and economic burden, and thus provides a strong case for increasing efforts to prevent RSV in the age group up to 4 years. The strengths of our study include the extended study period (14 seasons) and the availability of individual patient data for defined outcomes recorded in large, nationally representative databases, which reduced the risk of sampling error. Additionally, we employed a broad definition of respiratory disease to improve the sensitivity in capturing the full RSV-attributable disease burden, while retaining specificity. Finally, we report novel data on antibiotic prescribing attributable to RSV. We adopted a conservative approach to reduce the possibility of overestimating the burden of RSV, using a seasonal (sine/cosine pair) adjustment in the model to control for a number of seasonal confounders for which data are not available, including other important winter seasonal pathogens such as human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, human bocovirus, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses. 15 The cyclic component of the model was highly collinear with RSV seasonality, and less so with influenza. The cyclic components therefore took a greater portion of the burden of RSV than they took from the burden of influenza. Thus, inclusion of the cyclic terms in the model may have caused the burden of RSV to be underestimated; in any event, their inclusion substantially reduced the risk that the study overestimates RSV burden. This is because RSV infections follow regular seasonal cycles in temperate climates, and the seasonal terms do not necessarily adjust for temporal autocorrelation in the time series. This is a limitation of most studies on disease burden that make use of epidemiological time series because there is not currently a technique that can satisfactorily ensure temporal and spatial independence in the structure of the time-series data, and simultaneously yield biologically meaningful estimates of disease burden. The best approach in such cases is to recognise the exploratory nature of this type of study and avoid an excessive reliance on p values and CIs (which are determined based on the assumption of independence). When developing the model, we ran variants with shorter period cyclical terms, and found that adding these terms did not explain any more of the variability.",

We showed that most RSV infections in children were captured by a diagnosis of bronchitis and bronchiolitis. While other groups have modelled even broader diagnostic ranges (cardiorespiratory, or allcause), 18 19 we found that using multiple cause diagnoses ('any mention' for HES and ONS data) and a broad respiratory definition (respiratory disease broadly defined, all databases), consistently captured the RSV burden in all settings.

Our estimate of a large RSV-attributable burden of hospitalisation among infants is in agreement with the only RSV surveillance study to date with laboratory confirmation of infection that has provided populationbased estimates of RSV-related hospitalisations among young infants in the UK. 5 In this study, 3.6% of all <6 months old in one UK county were hospitalised with RSV-related lower RTI ( primarily bronchiolitis) during 1996-1999, 5 compared with our roughly equivalent estimate of 3.8% for hospitalisation for RSV-related bronchitis/bronchiolitis between 1997 and 2009. Our finding that more deaths in young children were attributable to RSV than to influenza is in line with previous surveillance of childhood RSV and influenza deaths in the UK between 1989 and 2000, and in the USA between 1990 and 1999, in which RSV deaths predominated in children <1 year of age and were lower, or roughly equal, to that of influenza in 1-4 years old. 7 18 We estimated around 340 000 RSV-attributable GP episodes per average season in children <5 years of age.

A survey of hospitalisations coded as RSV under ICD-9 in the USA (1997-2006) estimated a RSV hospitalisation rate of 3860/100 000 among children <6 months of age and 80/100 000 in 2-4 years old, compared with a somewhat higher average seasonal burden of 4184/100 000 and 114/100 000, respectively, in our study. 22 A prospective study of laboratory-confirmed RSV acute RTI reported even lower annual rates of hospitalisation: 1240-2170/100 000 in <6 months old between 2000 and 2004 versus 3856-4714/100 000 for comparable seasons in our study, and 20-50/100 000 in 2-4 years old versus 91-136/100 000 in our study. 23 These estimates could reflect differences in admission practices between the two countries, or real differences in disease burden, but the greater specificity of the diagnostic criteria used in those studies compared with our broader definition of respiratory disease likely accounts for much of the observed variation.",

This decrease was also apparent in antibiotic attributions for RSV (data not shown) and was also evident for RSV-attributable respiratory disease in adults. 25 We have no way of knowing whether this decrease is within normal long-term RSV seasonal variability-although in the other seasons studied, the burden of RSV was remarkably consistent-or if other factors such as climatic conditions or other circulating viruses may have played a role.",
