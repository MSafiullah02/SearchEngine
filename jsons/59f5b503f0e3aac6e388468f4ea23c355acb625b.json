The history of the development and abandonment of all potential compounds so far teaches us some important lessons for the continuation of our fight against colds. First, the common cold is a benign self-limiting condition, making the consumption of 'harmless' antivirals a requisite of prime importance for regulators. Second, the common cold is a syndrome caused by a myriad of known and unknown agents, which reduces the effectiveness of compounds that interfere with single specific agents or types of agents. The multifactorial nature of the genesis of colds makes it difficult for compounds showing in vitro efficacy to 'make the jump' to field effectiveness. Last, despite the heavy burden that the cold imposes on society, the vagueness and shortness of symptoms make it difficult for sufferers to present in time for physicians to prescribe antivirals, which are only effective if taken within a short time frame. Attention should be paid to the development of compounds with a non-virus-specific action.",

Our original dataset included correspondence records about the trials between CCU staff and manufacturers and other researchers active in the field. The Cochrane review identified 129 trials of antivirals and 63 of interferons carried out in the CCU between 1949 and 1989, the year of its closure (Tab. 1). Because of the difficulty in reconciling the raw data of the trials carried out in the CCU with those published in international journals at the time, we privileged the raw records, referring to them by the prefix \"CCU\" followed by the original trial serial number (e.g. CCU 362). In most cases no leading investigator's name was recognisable from existing records. In addition, several trials were run in 1 year making the use of the year identifier impossible. The final number of trials from CCU and all other sources included in our Cochrane review was 89. The review has since been withdrawn because of lack of funds for its maintenance. I hope Vaccines 7",

I have done this with the help of my Trial Search Coordinator Alessandro Rivetti who conducted searches of six different databases. As of today there are no antivirals registered for the common cold anywhere in the world, so the evidence is grouped according to type of compound, rather than its commercial name. Each compound is presented firstly by its pharmaceutical manufacturer (if known) and then its route of administration but readers should be aware that some of the reports contained data from several sub-studies.

In addition, we included data on different commonly reported adverse events, ranging from nasal stuffiness to blood-tinged mucus. Data on adverse events (in all comparisons) must be read singly and not cumulatively as one participant could have reported more than one adverse event at a time. Results show that, overall, interferon is significantly more efficacious than placebo in preventing experimental colds (protective efficacy: mean 46%, range 37-54%). The effect is significant in larger trials and against RV and coronavirus. Interferon does not appear to prevent middle ear and Eustachian tube pressure dysfunction, although denominators are very small. Administration of intranasal interferon is significantly associated with nasal stuffiness [odds ratio (OR) 2.22, 1.33-3.70] and increased sneezing.

            "text": "Most of the published reports and surviving records from the CCU do not allow a systematic evaluation of the four key design aspects of antiviral testing in humans: randomisation schedule generation, allocation concealment, blinding and completeness of follow-up. However, it was possible to reconstruct some of the methodology by looking at existing documentation and interviewing scientists. Here is how one scientist described early CCU viral challenge studies (carried out in the 1940s and 1950s): \"volunteers' names were listed and also the number of experimental groups defined. Then they were allocated usually using a table of random numbers (Yates). The group, usually indicated as A, B, C, was written on the list and was also used for the server capped bottles in which the inoculum was carried round to the flats. The list and the bottles could not easily be seen by the volunteers and the clinician and the nurse made their rounds separately and so did not see them at all. The list was kept in a laboratory drawer and rarely visited by the clinical team members. The scientist who performed the inoculum and often administered it had little contact with the volunteers in the early trials. He/ she might collect nasal secretions if a cold developed. After 1960 there were influenza trials. Blood rhinovirus antibodies could be often measured, but we could not pre-screen our volunteers as they did in the USA. Antiviral treatments at this stage might have been 'wasted' on volunteers who could have been shown to be immune. Thus, two researchers would bleed volunteers on arrival, do a rapid antibody assay and arrange volunteers in groups with similar antibody titres, usually nil or low, and the high-titre individuals might be allocated to experiments with an alternative virus or placebo (we always included volunteers with dummy inocula to motivate clinicians and volunteers -they were firmly told that some of them would be given inert drops and dummy drops and so they would be, we believe, discouraged from reporting symptoms if they fell into these placebo groups). Ordinarily, the groups would be allocated to treatments by a random method. Things became more formalised in the last phase with trials of interferons and capsid-binding drugs. Many of these trials were set up by Dr. Peter Higgins. The blinding methods remained virtually the same, though they were enhanced during the 1980s by distributing the inoculum into trials with the volunteers' names on the labels, so that the allocation information never left the lab and there was an extra safeguard against the volunteer being given the wrong material by mistake in the volunteer accommodation. It is difficult to document all these points, or to be precise about the dates on which practices were changed, but it should be possible to work out to some extent by using the date and clues supplied by the descriptions in the reports and papers. It is a generalisation that we never did open trials. Even when we were testing the effect of hot humid air we used a comparison or \"control\" in which the machine was adapted to generate warm but not too hot (43\u00b0C) air. In the zinc lozenge experiment we used a very strong washing flavour, and in the lab we thought the active and placebo preparations tasted the same on a direct comparison and by volunteers reorganising the active preps. I would want to be able to go back and do more experiments to contest that challenge. We did have some evidence that in the vitamin C experiments there was a fault of this sort. We had the practice of telling the volunteers at the end of the trial that they had been given active or placebo material. It then appeared that vitamin C was reducing symptoms after the end of the trial -the system then included the volunteers sending back a postcard with a report of symptoms they had after they got home. But we wondered whether this was an error, and only told the volunteers their treatment after they had sent their postcard. There were reports of apparent 'late' cures of symptoms.\"",

In the early days they looked for an 'objective' means of detecting a response, and concluded that the best was the 'handkerchief' count -any record of an increase of five or more used per day signified a cold. Nevertheless, a number of symptoms could be used and indeed the opinion of the volunteer that they had a cold seemed very reliable and was supported by a direct comparison organised with the MRC Epidemiology unit in Glasgow. In order to document the time course and to measure the response quantitatively, we added the handkerchief weight and found that with non-parametric statistics we could analyse the results in more detail. However, from the very first years it was clear that the very mildest cold could occur in those given non-infectious material and, although they were summarised as for example an \"abortive cold\", they did not represent a significant response. When there was a recognisable excess of nasal secretions this was considered a mild cold, more severe symptoms signified a moderate cold and a systemic response meant a severe cold. When we started working with influenza viruses these criteria did not quite meet the case. It was possible to have a definite systemic response with very little in the way of respiratory symptoms, so for these trials we added a separate assessment of systemic reactions. In general I think our threshold for a significant cold is very similar to that of the Virginia group and the Australians\".",

            "text": "Because of small numbers, the problem of volunteer susceptibility was ever present and we have received criticism from fellow researchers. Here is how two surviving CCU staff remember how they dealt with the problem: \"Volunteers were divided into two groups, which were balanced for age and sex. Rapid antibody assays were done using serum collected when they arrived at the unit and the antibody assay results were available by the end of the quarantine period. So the groups were balanced for antibody levels also. On the day of the beginning of the experiment the excluded volunteers were notified, and the volunteers with highest antibody were usually allocated to receive saline placebo. The groups were then allocated to either drug or placebo as described above -there was no particular system or method in this, e.g. no particular flat was used for drug treatment and because of the construction of groups the flats were allocated differently in each trial. After the trial volunteer's questionnaires were also scored for psychological susceptibility and it usually turned out that these were allocated in a balanced way too. Drugs and virus were sent out labelled with the volunteer's name. For drug trials, volunteers were allocated to groups balanced by age, sex and antibody titre against the virus to be given. There were always a few given no virus. Volunteers were not divided by flats but by individual characteristics. No particular method was used to decide which group had which treatment. When trials against two different viruses were running, volunteers with high titres against one virus would be put into a group to be given the other one. They were very strict about ensuring that the volunteer allocation record was shut away in the laboratory and not seen by either clinical staff or volunteers (it would be passed to the clinician after the final schedule of the volunteer clinical records had been written)\".",

Throughout our review of CCU data we considered volunteers as presenting with a \"cold\" if they suffered from a \"mild\", \"moderate\" or \"severe\" cold as defined in CCU records. \"Very mild\" and \"doubtful\" colds were classified by us as \"no colds\". Other routinely assessed outcomes, such as a rise in antibody titres and nasal shedding of viruses, were not included in the review as their clinical significance is doubtful.",

Their ease of application is counterbalanced by their effects on the nasal mucosa. Adverse events due to the use of interferons became more evident as more potent and purer interferons became available in the 1970s and 1980s. The reversible infiltrate and inflammation caused by intranasal administration led to the symptoms and signs of the very syndrome interferon use was trying to prevent. This caused poor compliance and ultimately poor effectiveness. The effects were more marked after prolonged intranasal administration. Little can be said about interferon effectiveness in treating ongoing colds, given the small denominators of the relevant studies and the difficulty in distinguishing between prevention and early treatment. These observations confirm what is known on the effects of interferons and confirm the rationale for their failure to achieve further development and registration.",

In addition, the apparent effectiveness of non-specific interven-tions such as interferons and dypiridamole teaches us an important lesson. When you are dealing with what is to all effects and purposes a syndrome caused by scores of different known and unknown agents, your best bet of success lies in introducing interventions or administering compounds that have a non-specific action like erecting physical barriers (social distancing), removing agents by physical attrition (hand washing), or building up your immune defences (immunomodulators).
