Here, we show that intravenously injected carbon quantum dots, functionalized with multiple paired \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups that bind to the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (which is expressed in most tumours), selectively accumulate in human tumour xenografts in mice and in an orthotopic mouse model of human glioma. The functionalized quantum dots, which structurally mimic large amino acids and can be loaded with aromatic drugs through \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, enabled-in the absence of detectable toxicity-near-infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of the tumours and a reduction in tumour burden after the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumours. The versatility of functionalization and high tumour selectivity of the quantum dots make them broadly suitable for tumour-specific imaging and drug delivery.",

In the current clinic, patients with cancer typically receive a combination of treatments, including surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which have substantially increased the overall survival and quality of life of the patients. However, the therapeutic effects of these treatments have been greatly limited by their inability to selectively image and deliver therapeutics to tumours 2, 3 .

The ligand-receptor approach is particularly limited for the imaging of brain tumours and the delivery of drugs to them owing to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [8] [9] [10] .

In particular, LAT1-which mediates the transport of large neutral amino acids-is promising, as it has been shown to be highly expressed in a wide variety of tumours. In normal tissue, LAT1 is expressed in only a few organs, including the placenta, BBB, spleen, testis and colon 13 . LAT1 has previously been targeted for cancer chemotherapy using LAT1 inhibitors, such as 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) 15 . Unfortunately, BCH-mediated chemotherapy has largely failed owing to a lack of potency and specificity. BCH inhibits all four LATs, including LAT1, LAT2, LAT3 and LAT4, each of which has distinct physiological functions. Effective inhibition of LAT1 requires high doses of BCH, which often induces significant toxicity 15 . LAT1 has also been targeted to enhance the delivery of chemotherapy drugs to tumours. It was shown that conjugation of aspartate enabled LAT1-mediated delivery, improving the accumulation of doxorubicin (DOX) in tumours by threefold to sixfold (ref. 16 ).",

            "text": "We determined the molecular structure of LAAM TC-CQDs. First, we determined the amount of amino acid groups on the edge of each LAAM TC-CQD using the classical ninhydrin reaction 21 . After incubation at 60 \u00b0C for 10 min, amino acid groups react with ninhydrin, leading to the formation of the purple-coloured product diketohydrindylidene diketohydrindamine, also known as Ruhemann's purple (RP), which has a maximum absorption at 570 nm. By measuring the absorption of RP, one can therefore calculate the amount of amino acids. The ninhydrin reaction is unique in that the production of RP depends on the amount of primary amino acid groups on the edge but not the structure of backbone, which we confirmed by testing six different amino acids, including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and glycine ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). We found that the absorption of RP is linearly correlated with the amount of amino acids ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ). We analysed LAAM TC-CQDs using the ninhydrin reaction and found that treatment with ninhydrin generated a new adsorption peak at 570 nm ( Supplementary Fig. 7c) , suggesting the presence of \u03b1-amino acid groups on the edge. A calculation based on the correlation between amino acids and absorption revealed that there are about eight amino acid groups at the edge of each LAAM TC-CQD. We next determined the chemical Fig. 8 ). The deconvoluted C1s spectrum revealed that there are three different types of carbon atoms, including graphitic and aliphatic (C=C and C-C), oxygenated (C-O, C=O and O-C=O) and N-containing (C-N, C=N and N-C=O) ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). The deconvoluted N1s spectrum showed three peaks at 399.0, 399.9 and 400.8 eV ( Supplementary Fig. 10) , which correspond to C-N, N-H and C=N, respectively. FT-IR spectrum analysis identified stretching vibrations for N-H (3,298 cm \u22121 and 3,190 cm \u22121 ), C=O (1,720 cm \u22121 ), C=N (1,624 cm \u22121 ), C-N (1,387 cm \u22121 ) and C-O (1,158 cm \u22121 ) bonds ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ), suggesting the formation of polyaromatic structures and the presence of free carboxyl and amino groups at the edge of LAAM TC-CQDs. In the 13 C-NMR spectrum, peaks between 120.0 ppm and 140.0 ppm can be ascribed to aromatic functionalities and conjugated double bonds (C=C and C=N), and peaks at 173.6 ppm, 170.2 ppm and 53.3 ppm are associated with O-C=O, N-C=O and C-N, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). The obtained structural information suggests that LAAM TC-CQDs might be formed through two steps. In the first step, under the hydrothermal condition, one molecule of TAAQ reacts with two molecules of CA, resulting a rigid carbon skeleton that consists of three benzene rings fused to four pyridine rings. Subsequently, the skeletons act as building blocks and undergo dehydration and decarboxylation, leading to the formation of LAAM TC-CQDs with high N doping in the large rigid \u03c0-conjugated structure and free \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups at the edge (Fig. 1a) . Together with the physical properties of LAAM TC-CQDs, which we determined using TEM and HRTEM, we determined the molecular structure of the majority of LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 1a) , which is consistent with a theoretical calculation using density functional theory (DFT) simulation (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) ( Supplementary Fig. 13 , Supplementary Table 1 ). On the basis of the structural information and size distribution, we calculated that the number average molecular mass (Mn) of LAAM TC-CQDs is 6,102.4 g mol \u22121 , the weight average molecular mass (Mw) is 62,78.3 g mol \u22121 and the polydispersity index-which is calculated as Mw/Mn-is 1.03. The polydispersity index is close to 1 (monodisperse), suggesting that the LAAM TC-CQDs are highly uniform. The ultraviolet-visible (ultraviolet-vis) absorption spectrum of LAAM TC-CQDs exhibited a strong characteristic absorption band centred at about 650 nm (Fig. 1c) . Two typical absorption peaks of CQDs at 230 nm and 280 nm represent the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition of the aromatic C=C bond and n-\u03c0* transitions of the aromatic sp 2 system containing C=O and C=N bonds, respectively 17, [22] [23] [24] . Fluorescence characterization was performed using different excitation wavelengths. We found that LAAM TC-CQDs exhibited only one fluorescent emission centre, with a NIR fluorescence emission peak at 700 nm, and the fluorescence emission wavelength was nearly independent of excitation ( Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 14) . We determined that the absolute fluorescence quantum yield of LAAM TC-CQDs was in the range of 6.8% to 10.7% in various solvents using a spectrometer attached to an integrating sphere (Supplementary Table 2) .",

A detailed list of the cells used in this study is provided in Supplementary Table 4 . Using laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM), we found that LAAM TC-CQDs penetrated all of the tested cancer cells, including HeLa and A549 cells, regardless of their origin or stemness. By contrast, LAAM TC-CQDs have a limited ability to penetrate non-cancerous cells, such as CCC-ESF-1 cells. This finding was confirmed using flow-cytometry analysis (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Figs. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Quantification analysis showed that ~99% of cancer cells (all except one BCSC line, for which the rate was 95%) were positive for LAAM TC-CQDs, whereas the rate for non-cancerous cells was limited to <30% (average of 13%; Fig. 2b , Supplementary Table 4 ). LCSM analysis found that a significant fraction of LAAM TC-CQDs entered the nuclei, which was demonstrated by the overlap of LAAM TC-CQD fluorescence and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescence. We further monitored the intracellular location of LAAM TC-CQDs over time after incubation with HeLa cells. We found that the majority of LAAM TC-CQDs localized on the cell membrane after 1 h and then entered the cytoplasm. After 6 h, a significant portion of LAAM TC-CQDs had entered the nuclei. By 8 h, the concentration of LAAM TC-CQDs in the nuclei exceeded the concentration of LAAM TC-CQDs in the cytoplasm ( Supplementary Fig. 25 , Supplementary Video 1). We used the same procedures to monitor the interaction between LAAM TC-CQDs and non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 26 , Supplementary Video 2). Consistent with our observations using LCSM and flow cytometry, we did not detect interaction between LAAM TC-CQDs and representative non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1 cells throughout the entire time window of 48 h.",

            "text": "We assessed whether LAAM TC-CQDs maintain the observed high degree of tumour specificity in vivo. LAAM TC-CQDs were injected intravenously into mice bearing HeLa tumours at 5 mg kg \u22121 . At 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h and 10 h after injection, the mice were analysed using fluorescence-PA imaging. Figure 2c showed that fluorescence in the tumour region gradually increased over time and peaked at 8 h, whereas fluorescence in other regions was not observed. Threedimensional (3D) reconstruction of fluorescence images confirmed that LAAM TC-CQDs selectively imaged tumours but not normal tissues (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Video 3) . The high degree of selectivity was validated by ex vivo imaging of isolated organs and tumours, which showed that the fluorescence signal in tumours was substantially greater than that of normal organs (Fig. 2e , Supplementary  Fig. 27 ). Consistent with our finding using fluorescence imaging, the average PA intensity in tumours increased continuously over time until 8 h after injection, when the PA signal was predominantly concentrated in tumours (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 28 ). To exclude the possibility that the observed tumour specificity is unique to HeLa tumours, we evaluated LAAM TC-CQDs in four additional tumour xenografts derived from A549 cells, PANC-1 cells, MCF-7 cells and MD-MBA-231 cells, respectively. We found that LAAM TC-CQDs imaged tumours in all of the tested models, with a kinetics and specificity similar to those observed in the HeLa We studied whether the observed high degree of tumour specificity could be achieved using traditional CQDs. G-CQDs 22 , Y-CQDs 24 , B-CQDs 23 and B,S-CQDs 17 were synthesized as examples. We incubated these four previously reported CQDs with a panel of cancer and non-cancerous cells, and we assayed specificity using flow cytometry. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34, all of the tested CQDs penetrate both cancer and non-cancerous cells without selectivity. After cell penetration, most of the CQDs were localized in the cytoplasm. G-CQDs were selected and further evaluated in mice bearing HeLa tumours. The experiments were performed according to the same procedures that were used in the LAAM TC-CQDs study. A 3D reconstruction of fluorescence images suggested that, in addition to the tumours, there was fluorescence signal in the liver, lungs and kidneys ( Supplementary  Fig. 35, Supplementary Video 4) . Ex vivo imaging showed that the fluorescence intensities in the lungs and kidneys were substantially greater than those in the tumour ( Supplementary Fig. 36 ). We evaluated whether the traditional CQDs could be engineered to reach the degree of tumour specificity observed in LAAM TC-CQDs through conjugation of tumour-targeting ligands. We synthesized G-CQDs with surface conjugation of folic acid (FA) according to our previously published procedures 23 . The resulting CQDs, termed FA-G-CQDs, were evaluated in mice bearing both HeLa and A549 tumours. HeLa tumours, but not A549 tumours, are known to overexpress the FA receptor 26, 30 . As expected, we found that FA conjugation enhanced the accumulation of FA-G-CQDs in HeLa tumours, but not in A549 tumours ( Supplementary Fig. 37 ), suggesting that the ligand-conjugation approach primarily enhances the targeting efficiency of CQDs for receptor-expressing tumours. Although the fluorescence signal in HeLa tumours was greater than that of other organs, we observed significant levels of fluorescence signal in the liver, lungs and kidneys, which was confirmed by ex vivo imaging ( Supplementary Fig. 38 ).",

Finally, we assessed the impact of long-term incubation in blood serum on the size and fluorescence emission of LAAM TC-CQDs.

            "text": "To investigate the manner in which cells uptake LAAM TC-CQDs, we treated HeLa cells with an excess of Leu, Phe or Gly before adding LAAM TC-CQDs. In contrast to Gly, Leu and Phe are both high-affinity substrates of LAT1 (ref. 33 ). We found that the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs was substantially inhibited by Leu and Phe but not by Gly (Fig. 3a) . On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that LAAM TC-CQDs penetrate cancer cells through interaction with LAT1. This hypothetical mechanism is supported by six lines of evidence. First, pretreatment with the LAT1 inhibitor BCH considerably reduces the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs by HeLa cells (Fig. 3a) . Quantification using flow cytometry showed that pretreatment with BCH reduced the cellular uptake rates from ~99% to ~20% across all of the tested cell lines, including HeLa, A549, PANC-1, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231 SP cells ( Supplementary Fig. 43 ). Second, LAT1 knockout, which was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 and western blotting, markedly reduced the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs by HeLa cells by ~80% ( Fig. 3b -d, Supplementary Fig. 44 ). Third, overexpressing LAT1 in HeLa cells through lentiviral transduction enhanced the cellular uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs in vitro (Fig. 3e ). Fourth, the expression level of LAT1 correlated with the amount of LAAM TC-CQDs that penetrated cells in various cell lines (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 45 , Supplementary Table 5 ). Consistent with previous reports, the level of LAT1 expression in cancer cells was substantially greater than that in non-cancerous cells 11, 13, 14 . Fifth, the overexpression of LAT1 in HeLa tumours enhanced the uptake LAAM TC-CQDs by 4.9-fold in vivo (Fig. 3g) . Sixth, in an in vivo competition study, pretreatment with Leu reduced the accumulation of LAAM TC-CQDs in tumours by 42% (Fig. 3h) .",

To measure the total binding, cells were treated with various concentrations of LAAM TC-CQDs. After 60 min, the cells were washed, collected and analysed for uptake on the basis of fluorescence intensities using flow cytometry. To determine the non-specific binding, cells were pretreated with BCH at 5 mM followed by treatment with LAAM TC-CQD and then analysed using flow cytometry. LAT1-dependent uptake was obtained by subtracting the non-specific binding from the total binding. By fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data using weighted nonlinear least squares ( Supplementary Fig. 46b ), we determined that the binding affinity K m was 1.4 \u03bcM, which is comparable to the value determined by surface plasmon resonance.",

First, we performed docking analysis to identify the part of the LAT1 structure that LAAM CQDs bind to. Using the AutoDock Lamarckian Genetic algorithm, we simulated the interaction between LAAM TC-CQDs and the LAT1-4F2hc (CD98) heteromeric complex 34 . We found that LAAM TC-CQDs bind to LAT1 on the edge through hydrogen bonds formed between the amino acid groups in LAAM TC-CQDs and the Lys 77, Asn 242, Leu 238, Trp 452 and Lys 77 residues in LAT1 ( Supplementary Fig. 47a ). The rigid sp 2 -conjugate hydrophobic plane is also involved the binding ( Supplementary Fig. 47b ). We calculated that the docking energy is E = \u22122.07 kcal mol \u22121 . No specific interaction between LAAM TC-CQDs and 4F2hc was found, suggesting that 4F2hc might not be essential for the LAT1-mediated internalization of CQDs. Furthermore, simulation using AutoDock did not find direct interactions between LAAM TC-CQDs and the internal LAT1 binding pocket. Collectively, these findings suggest that uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs probably does not occur through LAT1-mediated transport. Second, we evaluated the internalization of LAAM TC-CQDs in the presence of endocytic-trafficking inhibitors, including chlorpromazine and genistein, which inhibit clathrin-and caveolin-dependent endocytosis, respectively 35 . BCH was included as a control. We found that both chlorpromazine and BCH inhibited LAAM TC-CQD internalization by around 80%. By contrast, genistein did not notably inhibit the uptake of LAAM TC-CQDs ( Supplementary Fig. 48 ). These results suggest that the internalization of LAAM TC-CQDs is mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Third, we measured the transport of LAAM TC-CQDs in cells by continuous fluorescence monitoring in the presence or absence of BCH. We found that, in the absence of BCH, intracellular fluorescence increased over time for the first 6 h, after which no further significant increase was observed. In the presence of BCH, there was little intracellular fluorescence throughout the entire time course (Supplementary Fig. 49 ). The kinetics of CQD internalization is consistent with the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis 36, 37 . Fourth, we measured the change in the intracellular concentration of LAAM TC-CQDs after incubation using LCSM.",

Major limitations associated with traditional chemotherapy include significant adverse toxicity to normal tissues and intrinsic or acquired drug resistance owing to overexpression of multidrug resistance ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The efficacy of DNAdamaging chemotherapy drugs, which function through interactions with DNA within the nuclei, are often further reduced by their limited ability to penetrate the nucleus 38 . Those limitations can potentially be overcome by using LAAM TC-CQDs as a drug carrier. First, LAAM TC-CQDs have considerable tumour-specific targeting, making it possible to avoid systemic toxicity. Second, owing to their nanoscopic size, LAAM TC-CQDs may not be removed by ABC transporters 39, 40 . Third, LAAM TC-CQDs efficiently penetrate the nucleus, making it possible to maximize the efficacy of DNAdamaging chemotherapy.",

            "text": "We evaluated LAAM TC-CQDs as a drug carrier for the delivery of DNA-damaging chemotherapy drugs. LAAM TC-CQDs have large \u03c0-conjugated structures that enable the loading of aromatic chemotherapy drugs-such as topotecan hydrochloride (TPTC), DOX and hydroxycamptothecin-through a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction ( Supplementary Fig. 52 ). We further evaluated TPTC-loaded LAAM TC-CQDs (TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs), which were synthesized by mixing LAAM TC-CQDs with TPTC overnight followed with extensive dialysis. Successful loading of TPTC was evidenced by the characteristic ultraviolet-vis absorbance peak at 390 nm that is superimposed on the absorption spectrum of LAAM TC-CQDs ( Supplementary Fig. 52a ). The slight redshift of the absorption peak of TPTC after loading could be attributed to the \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interaction between TPTC and LAAM TC-CQDs. TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs have dual fluorescence emissions that correspond to TPTC (Supplementary Fig. 53 , yellow channel) and LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 1d, red channel) . We characterized the interaction between TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs and a panel of cancer cells and non-cancerous cells. The TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs retained the selective penetrability to tested HeLa and A549 cancer cells, and delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs eliminates the penetration of TPTC to non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1cells (Fig. 4a) . On the basis of fluorescence intensity, delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs enhanced the accumulation of TPTC in the nuclei by 4.5-fold and 5.2-fold for HeLa and A549 cells, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 54 ). Next, we characterized TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs for the treatment of HeLa tumours. Delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs markedly enhanced the toxicity of TPTC to HeLa cells but reduced its toxicity to non-cancerous cells (Fig. 4b) . At a concentration equivalent to 5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 TPTC, TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs killed all HeLa cells but did not exhibit toxicity to non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1 cells. By contrast, free TPTC at the same concentration inhibited both cells at a comparable efficiency. The reduced toxicity to normal cells is probably because LAAM TC-CQDs, along with the cargo TPTC, cannot penetrate normal cells (Fig. 4a) . Without the ability to penetrate cells, TPTC cannot exert its toxicity, as it functions in the nuclei. We determined the pharmacokinetics of TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs in mice bearing HeLa tumours. For comparison, TPTC-loaded liposomes-designated as TPTC-liposomes-were synthesized using a molar ratio of 56:39:5 HSPC:cholesterol:PEG 2000-DSPE ( Supplementary Fig. 55 ). The same lipid composition was used in several FDA-approved liposomal formulations, including Doxil 41 . TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs and control free TPTC or TPTC-liposomes were administered intravenously at a dose equivalent to 2 mg kg \u22121 TPTC. The blood was collected at various time points. TPTC in the plasma was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. As shown in Fig. 4c , delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs substantially enhanced the blood circulation and bioavailability of TPTC; the half-life of TPTC increased from 5.4 min to 40.1 min and the area under the curve (AUC) increased from 13.4 to 138.1. By contrast, the half-life and AUC of TPTCliposomes were 11.8 min and 55.1, respectively (Fig. 4c) . We next examined the biodistribution of TPTC in a second cohort of mice that received the same treatment. As expected, free TPTC was widely distributed over the body without specificity. By contrast, TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs exhibited kinetics similar to the kinetics of LAAM TC-CQDs ( Supplementary Fig. 56 ). By 8 h, TPTC could be detected only in tumours. Ex vivo imaging of isolated organs confirmed that LAAM TC-CQDs enabled highly specific delivery of TPTC to tumours (Supplementary Fig. 57 ). Quantification on the basis of TPTC fluorescence intensity showed that delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs increased the concentration of TPTC in tumours by 16.7-fold while substantially reducing the accumulation of TPTC in other organs. The amount of LAAM TC-CQDs accumulated in the tumours accounted for 15.3% of the total injection dose. By contrast, a significant amount of TPTC-liposomes were found in the liver. Delivery through the liposomes increased the concentration of TPTC in tumours by 6.7-fold (Fig. 4d) . We assessed TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs for treatment of HeLa tumours. When tumour volumes reached around 100 mm 3 , the mice were randomly grouped and received intravenous administration of saline, TPTC (2 mg kg \u22121 ), TPTC-liposomes or TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs (TPTC-liposomes and TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs at a dose equivalent to 2 mg kg \u22121 TPTC) at days 1, 4, 8 and 12. At day 27, tumours in the mice receiving TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs treatment shrank to an undetectable level (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 58 ). By contrast, tumours in the mice receiving free TPTC or TPTC-liposomes continuously grew, although at rates that were slower than that of the control mice (Fig. 4e) . Tumour growth curves for individual tumour-bearing mice are provided in Supplementary Fig. 59 Fig. 59 ).",

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 60 , treatment with TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs did not induce apparent weight loss throughout the study. By contrast, weight loss was observed in the groups receiving free TPTC or TPTC-liposomes. Consistent with this finding, haematoxylin and eosin analysis of major organs isolated from normal mice receiving TPTC-LAAM TC-CQD treatment did not detect inflammatory infiltration or pathological damage. However, apparent myocardial fibre rupture, diffuse ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, pulmonary hyperaemia and focal tubular necrosis were found in mice that were treated with free TPTC ( Supplementary  Fig. 61) . We next performed a complete blood count analysis to measure various parameters, including white blood cells, red blood cells, haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, platelets, red cell distribution width, platelet distribution width, platelet volume and thrombocytocrit. We found that, comparable to mice that received saline as a control, mice that received TPTC-LAAM TC-CQD treatment had parameters within the normal ranges ( Supplementary Fig. 62) , suggesting that TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs are haemocompatible. Serum biochemistry analyses, including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase tests for hepatic function, and urea nitrogen and creatinine for renal function, did not detect abnormality in TPTC-LAAM TC-CQD-treated mice ( Supplementary  Fig. 63 ). We found that-although LAAM TC-CQDs are nonbiodegradable, demonstrated by the unchanged size and fluorescence emission after incubation for 30 d in serum-containing PBS ( Supplementary Fig. 42 )-LAAM TC-CQDs can be rapidly metabolized through renal clearance. Seventy-two hours after intravenous administration, 81.6% of LAAM TC-CQDs were detected in urine and 8.4% were detected in faeces (Supplementary Fig. 64) .",

We propose that LAAM TC-CQDs are capable of penetrating the BBB and interacting with brain tumours with high specificity. To test this hypothesis, we intravenously injected LAAM TC-CQDs into mice bearing U87 gliomas, which were analysed using NIR fluorescence imaging at various time points. We found that the accumulation of LAAM TC-CQDs in the brain increased over time and peaked at 8-12 h after injection, when the fluorescence signals were predominately identified in the brain (Fig. 5a) . Ex vivo imaging of organs and tumours isolated from mice that were euthanized at the 12 h time point showed that LAAM TC-CQDs efficiently accumulated in brain tumours (Fig. 5b) . 3D reconstruction of fluorescence images confirmed that LAAM TC-CQDs preferentially accumulated in tumours, with substantially lower signal in other tissues (Fig. 5c) .",

The in vitro BBB model was established by culturing human brain microvascular endothelial hCMEC/D3 cells on the top insert membrane and human astrocyte NHA cells on the bottom membrane of a Transwell culture plate 43 (Supplementary Fig. 65a ). LAAM TC-CQDs were added to the top chamber. Penetrability was determined by quantifying the proportion of LAAM TC-CQDs that penetrated to the bottom chamber. We found that pretreatment with the LAT1 substrate Leu inhibited the penetrability by 36% (Fig. 5d) . Consistent with this, an in vivo competition study showed that pretreatment with Leu reduced the accumulation of LAAM TC-CQDs in brain tumours by 80% (Fig. 5e) . Taken together, these results suggest that LAT1 plays a critical role in mediating the brain penetration of LAAM TC-CQDs.",

Consistent with our findings in HeLa and A549 cells, TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs demonstrated a substantially greater cytotoxicity to U87 cells compared with the free TPTC (Fig. 5f) . Delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs enhanced the delivery of TPTC to tumours by 16.7-fold (Fig. 5g) and increased the half-life and AUC of TPTC in the blood by 10.1-fold (from 4.8 min to 48.6 min) and 12.2-fold (from 23.9 to 290.9; Supplementary Fig. 65b) , respectively. By contrast, TPTC-liposomes failed to demonstrate comparable enhancement effects (Fig. 5f,g, Supplementary Fig. 65b) . We further analysed the therapeutic benefits of TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs for treating U87 brain tumours. Two weeks after tumour inoculation, mice were randomly grouped and treated with TPTC (2 mg kg \u22121 ) or TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs or TPTC-liposomes (both at a dose equivalent to 2 mg kg \u22121 TPTC), administered three times a week for two weeks. Treatment with TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs effectively enhanced the survival of tumour-bearing mice to 16 d, which was substantially greater than the survival of the mice that were treated with free TPTC (3 d) and TPTC-liposomes (4 d; P < 0.001; Fig. 5h ). Furthermore, TPTC-LAAM TC-CQD-treated mice did not decrease in weight over the course of treatment, whereas both free-TPTC-treated and TPTC-liposome-treated mice did ( Supplementary Fig. 65c ).",

            "text": "To determine the molecular structure that accounts for the tumour specificity observed in LAAM TC-CQDs, we systematically analysed an array of LAAM TC-CQD analogues. First, we determined whether the carboxyl groups or the amino groups or both are essential. We removed the carboxyl and amino groups on the edge of LAAM TC-CQDs through hydrazine hydrate (NH 2 -NH 2 ) reduction 24 and a carbodiimide (EDC)-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) coupling reaction with acetic acid 23 , respectively ( Supplementary  Figs. 66-68) . The resulting NH 2 -and COOH-null LAAM TC-CQDs were evaluated in HeLa and CCC-ESF-1 cells. The removal of either carboxyl or amino groups abolished the tumour-specific penetrability of LAAM TC-CQDs, and the resulting CQDs penetrated both cancer and non-cancerous cells without selectivity (Fig. 6a,b) . Flowcytometry analysis (Supplementary Fig. 69 ) revealed that, in contrast to unmodified LAAM TC-CQDs, LAAM TC-CQDs without NH 2 groups and COOH groups had 46% and 48% reduced uptake in HeLa cells, respectively, and 414% and 613% increased uptake non-cancerous CCC-ESF-1 cells (Fig. 6c) . Furthermore, we found that, consistent with previous reports [44] [45] [46] , ultraviolet irradiation at 365 nm for 5 h deoxidized the surface of CQDs, leading to a significant reduction in the amount of amino acid groups ( Supplementary  Fig. 41b ) and, as a consequence, the remaining LAAM TC-CQDs lost most of their cancer-targeting specificity ( Supplementary Fig. 41c ). We next tested whether the presence of a carboxyl group and an amino group on the same \u03b1 position is essential. 2,6-CQDs, which bear the same number of carboxyl and amino groups, were synthesized using 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (2,6-DAAQ) and CA and were analysed for their structure and optical properties ( Supplementary Figs. 70-75, Supplementary Table 6 ). All of the carboxyl and amino groups of 2,6-CQDs are located in different positions relative to LAAM TC-CQDs. LCSM and flow-cytometry analysis showed that the altered carboxyl and amino positions results in a complete loss of tumour-specific penetrability; 2,6-CQDs penetrate both HeLa and CCC-ESF-1 cells with comparable efficiency (Fig. 6a-c, Supplementary Fig. 76) . We assessed whether the number of paired \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups is associated with tumour-specific penetrability. Table 6 ). 1,4-CQDs, which are structurally similar to LAAM TC-CQDs but bear half as many paired groups, maintained tumour-specific penetrability (Fig. 6a) . However, the penetration efficiency of 1,4-CQDs was substantially reduced to 61% of the penetration efficiency of LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 6b,c) . 1,5-CQDs, which are also structurally similar to LAAM TC-CQDs and bear the same number of paired groups, penetrated HeLa cells with efficiency that was comparable to LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 6a-c) . Finally, we determined whether the backbone structure of LAAM TC-CQDs is important for its function. We synthesized Phe-CQDs, which bear paired \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups but have a substantially different backbone from LAAM TC-CQDs, using Phe and analysed their structure and optical properties (Supplementary Figs. 77-80). We found that Phe-CQDs maintained the tumour-specific penetrability in HeLa and CCC-ESF-1 cells, although the uptake of Phe-CQDs in HeLa cells was 36% of that of LAAM TC-CQDs (Fig. 6a-c, Supplementary Fig. 81) . The low penetrability of Phe-CQDs might be attributed to the poor water solubility of Phe-CQDs, which resulted in low dispersion in solution.",

We characterized LAAM TC-CQDs, LAAM CQDs, and found that they enable NIR fluorescence-PA dual-mode imaging, which is optimal for deep-tissue imaging. We demonstrated that LAAM TC-CQDs are capable of imaging tumours with high selectivity (Fig. 2) . The high degree of selectivity is probably because LAAM TC-CQDs efficiently penetrate cancer cells but not most normal cells (Figs. 2 and 4) administration, LAAM TC-CQDs are expected to accumulate in tumours and penetrate into tumour cells through interactions with LAT1. By contrast, the CQDs cannot penetrate normal cells and, as a consequence, are eliminated from normal tissues through rapid kidney excretion (Supplementary Fig. 64 ). Owing to its high specificity to tumours and intrinsic optical properties, LAAM TC-CQDs have great potential to be used for tumour imaging as well as for image-guided surgery. Second, LAAM TC-CQDs are capable of targeted drug delivery to tumours with a high degree of specificity and efficiency. This cannot be achieved through the conjugation of traditional tumour-targeting ligands, which has also been shown to fail to considerably improve tumour-targeting efficiency 4 . Consistent with these findings, we found that conjugation of ligands enhanced the delivery of CQDs to some tumours, but not others, and did not substantially reduce their non-specific accumulation in normal tissues (Supplementary Fig. 38 ). Tumour-targeting ligands have previously been tested for LAT1-mediated drug delivery to tumours through conjugation of aspartate 16 . It was found that LAT1 targeting improved the accumulation of DOX in tumours by threefold to sixfold. However, a comparable amount of DOX was also found in the liver. By contrast, we found that delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs enhanced the accumulation of TPTC in tumours by 16.7-fold, while the accumulation of TPTC in the liver was reduced to a barely detectable level (1.8% of that in the tumours; Fig. 4d ). The observed difference between these two studies may be because LAAM TC-CQDs and aspartate have different affinities with LAT1. We found that the specificity of LAAM CQDs is correlated with the number of paired \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups on the edge (Fig. 6 ). It seems that the local high density of \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups triggers a multivalent, strong interaction with LAT1. As a result, delivery by LAAM TC-CQDs, which bear lots of \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups, markedly enhances the penetration of TPTC into tumour cells. As most normal tissues do not express LAT1, LAAM TC-CQDs cannot penetrate normal cells and are quickly eliminated from the circulatory system (Fig. 2b) . In contrast to LAAM CQDs, aspartate has only one pair of \u03b1-carboxyl and amino groups and, as a result, the interaction between aspartate-conjugated DOX and LAT1 could be weak owing to a lack of multivalency. As a consequence, aspartate-conjugated DOX has a low affinity for tumour cells and can non-specifically penetrate normal cells, leading to high accumulation in normal organs 16 .",

Over the past few decades, we have witnessed significant improvements in the treatments for many types of cancers; however, for solid tumours of the brain, the prognosis remains dismal. The limited progress in the treatment of brain cancer can be largely attributed to the BBB. Although the vasculature of the tumour core tends to be leaky, the BBB is nearly intact in the capillaries that feed the proliferating tumour edge and the surrounding brain tissue and, unfortunately, enhancing drug delivery to brain tumours through traditional ligand-mediated delivery has not been successful 8, 9 . The existence of the BBB has also limited the ability to image tumours in the brain, particularly those infiltrating tumour cells located in the region where the BBB is largely intact and where imaging contrast agents cannot be delivered in sufficient quantities 48 . Here we have shown that LAAM CQDsthrough their interaction with LAT1, which is a target expressed in both the BBB and in tumour cells-are capable of imaging and delivering therapeutic agents to tumours in the brain with high specificity and efficiency.",

To establish mouse xenografts, tumour cells were subcutaneously inoculated into female BALB/c mice. When the tumour volumes reached ~100 mm 3 , the mice were intravenously administered with saline, TPTC or TPTC-LAAM TC-CQDs (n = 5). Changes in tumour volume and body weight were monitored daily. The volume of the tumour was calculated according to the following formula: V = D \u00d7 d 2 /2 where D and d are the longest and shortest diameters of tumour, respectively, measured using a Vernier calliper. Relative tumour volumes were calculated as V/V 0 where V 0 is the initial tumour volume when the treatment was started.",
