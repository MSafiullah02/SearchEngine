It has been reported that the most common symptoms include fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgia, and dyspnea. Meanwhile, less common symptoms are nasal congestion, headache, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea (Wang et al. 2020). Although the number of clinical cases with olfactory dysfunction is gradually increasing abroad (Lechien et al. 2020), it has not been reported so far in China. We report 3 cases of new coronavirus pneumonia with olfactory dysfunction, two of which were accompanied by taste disorders. These cases will improve awareness of the symptoms and the treatment of the disease.",

However, the median recovery time of olfactory dysfunction was 20 days reflecting the slow recovery of neurological function.

Moreover, coronavirus has neuropathic effects. There have been reports of human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with concomitant peripheral neuropathy in all four limbs or acute olfactory neuropath (Tsai et al. 2005; Hwang 2006). Cases 2 and 3 were accompanied by nasal obstruction and recovered rapidly. Inflammatory edema of the mucous membrane may be the main mechanism. However, the slow relief on olfactory dysfunction may be related to damage to the olfactory central nervous system.",

The expression pattern of ACE2 in different organs indicates the potential high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be closely related to clinical manifestations (Zou et al. 2020). In particular, a high level of ACE2 expression was identified in numerous cell types, including esophageal upper and stratified epithelial cells, type II alveolar cells of lung, myocardial cells, absorptive enterocytes of the ileum and colon, cholangiocytes, kidney proximal tubule cells, and bladder urothelial cells (Zou et al. 2020). For example, high expression of ACE2 in the genitourinary system in patients with COVID-19 causes rare symptoms of orchitis. Thus, the accompanying taste disorders in these two cases may be also related to the expression level of ACE2 in the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa (Xu et al. 2020). The aforementioned examples provided a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and olfactory disorders. However, the underlying mechanism requires further study. In addition, all three patients in this report were young people, and whether the expression level of ACE2 is related to age is currently unknown.",

Additionally, intensive consultation and further detection are required in these cases according to the ignorance of uncommon symptoms, such as symptoms of neurological injury. Furthermore, there is no strong clinical evidence to show an effective clinical intervention, despite the use of corticosteroids or neurotrophic drugs (Harless and Liang 2016). Restricted by drug kinds, we chose methylcobalamin, which has the function of nerve nutrition, and methylprednisolone, which is thought to have a significant effect in treatments of olfactory dysfunction (Schriever et al. 2012). However, the number of cases is limited. The therapeutic efficacy needs to be confirmed in a larger cohort. Based on these three cases, early diagnosis and intervention would be the key to the recovery of olfactory dysfunction, particularly for young people.",
