This virus, known as pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), shared molecular features with North American and European swine, avian and human influenza viruses. Pandemic H1N1 virus is extremely contagious with person-to-person transmission [2, 3]. In June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic level to 6 lasting until August 2010 [4]. As of 1 August 2010, more than 214 countries have reported to the WHO laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 with over 18,449 deaths [4].",

Afebrile and atypical clinical presentations have been described in some risk groups such as pregnant women and immunosuppressed patients [5]. Most patients have a relatively mild and self-limited disease. However, pH1N1 infection may cause severe disease requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission because of severe hypoxemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and shock [1, 5]. In contrast to seasonal influenza, children and young adults, frequently with no predisposing chronic illnesses, are more affected and prone to complications [1, 5\u20137]. It has been reported that between 9% and 31% of hospitalized patients required admission to the ICU, where 4\u201346% died [5\u20138]. Among the sickest patients, children seem to be more often complicated by secondary bacterial infections, whereas severe disease in adults is usually caused by primary viral pneumonia and ARDS [6].",

Images were also assessed for the presence of other abnormalities such as pleural effusion and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.

In both cases, patchy areas of parenchymal consolidation and GGO as well as small pleural effusions were found (Fig. 3). No nodules, reticular pattern, or lymphadenopathies were found. In five out of eight patients, a rapid progression of the initial radiological abnormalities in less than 48 h was observed. Eventually, four patients developed fibrosis on follow-up thoracic imaging. In the multivariant analysis, a higher number of lung zones were involved, and the patchy consolidation pattern on the initial chest radiograph as well as a rapid progression of the radiological abnormalities within the first 48 h were identified in patients requiring ICU admission and development of ARDS.\n\n\n",

One difference is, however, the lower prevalence of GGO in our series compared with other reports in which there were a higher number of patients studied with CT. In addition, the fact that a substantial proportion of bedside anteroposterior radiographs (instead of the two projections) were obtained in the group of patients with eventual admission to ICU may have decreased the detection of subtle areas of GGO and underestimated the presence of small consolidations in the retrocardiac area.",
