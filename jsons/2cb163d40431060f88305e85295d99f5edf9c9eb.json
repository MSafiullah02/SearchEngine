A further person of influence in the US was Roy Bergengren (1879 Bergengren ( -1955 who along with Filene formed the Credit Union National Extension Bureau which was tasked with lobbying for credit union legislation at both State and Federal level. In 1934, the Federal Credit Union Act was passed. This Act encapsulated much of Bergengren\"s interpretation of what credit unions are, how they should be structured and how they operate in law. (Moody and Fite, 1984; Kaushik and Lopez, 1994) . During the remainder of the 20th Century, the model continued its spread and now extends to most of the Anglo-Saxon world and beyond (Fonteyne and Hardy, 2011) . Table 1 details a selection of size and market share metrics for cooperative banks. This information is for end year 2018 and concentrates upon European countries where cooperative banks originate and currently have significant market share. 5 There are 2,816 4 The Rochdale principles include open, voluntary membership to all; democratic control of the society; a governance structure where each member is entitled to one vote regardless of the number of shares owned; a limited return (if any) on equity capital; and the return to members of the cooperative\"s surplus in proportion to their patronage. 5 Cooperative banks also established in a number of countries outside Europe. Japan\"s banking system comprises a large group of member-based banks consisting of credit associations (Shinkin banks), credit unions (Shinkumi banks), as well as various other mutual banks such as agricultural, fishery cooperatives and labour banks, (Glass et al., 2014a; Udell, 2015, 2019) . In 2019, there were 256 Shinkin banks, which conduct their business through a network of 7,003 branches serviced by 107,412 employees (of whom 2,118 are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f independent cooperative banks operating through 51,588 branches, with 712,700 employees and aggregate assets of \u20ac712.7 billion. Customer reach extends significantly beyond core membership (members to customers across countries averages 40%). Cooperative banks in Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have a sizeable share of the domestic banking market while in Finland, France, Germany and the Netherlands they are also an important source of funding for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). countries across six continents. These credit unions had total assets of $2,191 billion and a membership of 274.2 million (population penetration of 9.38%). Africa dominates in terms of credit unions numbers (39,447; 46.2%) but they have only 13.0% of worldwide members, 0.5% of worldwide assets and a population penetration rate within Africa of 13.8%. In contrast, North America has 7% of credit union numbers, but 46.7% of worldwide members and 81.5% of total assets and a population penetration in North America of 48.88%. The credit union movement in Europe has a penetration rate of 9.16%. In Western European countries (with the exception of Ireland and Great Britain), credit unions have not emerged as a distinct group as their activities are captured by cooperative banks. While in Eastern Europe (with the exception of Lithuania, Moldova and Poland), credit unions are in a formative stage of development.",

The authors conclude that integrated systems are more efficient and economise on bounded rationality. 6 Network arrangements in credit unions are most commonly characterised by the so-called atomised model. This involves relatively loose integration of member credit unions, which is generally limited to representation, lobbying and public relations . A notable exception is the credit union movement in Canada where Desjardins caisses populaire operate along the lines of a complex federated model. The individual caisse are independent and autonomously incorporated entities, but operate in a structured, standardised and closely inter-connected environment (McMurtry and Brouard, 2015) . The Desjardins federated structure provides significant economies of scale and both industry presence and profile in the marketplace (Levasseur and Rousseau, 2002) . In other jurisdictions such as the US, credit unions form Credit Union Services Organisations (CUSOs) which are limited liability companies to facilitate shared services. Some CUSOs involve cooperation among a small number of credit unions, while others involve large numbers of credit unions that enter and exit the CUSO as circumstances change. CUSOs allow credit unions to achieve economies of scale and engage in activities that individual institutions may regard as too costly or risky, or that are prohibited by regulations (Wilcox, 2005) . describe CUSOs as the best example of \"structural ambidexterity\" in the credit union system. 7",

At a structural level, this reduces the need for extensive bricks and mortar branch networks commonly found in the traditional banking 6 Rationality is bounded because there are limits to our thinking capacity, available information, and time (Simon, 1982) . 7 Structural ambidexterity refers to setting up formally separate units (divisions, departments, or teams) within the organization, with some units focusing on \"exploit\" tasks and others on \"explore\" tasks. Each unit has separate employees, processes, and cultures. An integrated corporate leadership strategy adjusts the allocation of financial, physical, and labour resources across units over time (Campbell and Dopico (2016, p 11) .",

These relationships facilitate the gathering of \"soft information\" that can be used to mitigate screening and monitoring costs and more readily provide credit to informationally opaque borrowers. 8 Large complex banks are not considered to engage in relationship lending 8 Soft information can be defined as information that is difficult to interpret, verify, and transfer. For instance, appraisals of certain forms of collateral, such as real estate, may require expertise of individuals with specialized knowledge of local markets. Soft information can also be embedded in existing relationships, including social ones. For instance, a borrower\"s stature in the community and relationship with neighbours may inform the character, or social capital, of the borrower that in turn informs credit worthiness . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f because they are at a competitive disadvantage when information about individual investment projects is innately soft Stein, 2002) . Transactional banking, commonly associated with large complex banks, places weight on \"hard information\", and is consequently more conducive to borrowers with lower informational opacity. Hard information is defined as information that can be readily quantified, objectively collected, and easily communicated. 9 Neuberger et al. (2008) find localism and cooperative ownership are positively associated with the relational orientation of financial institutions (see also Uzzi, 1999) . find that lending rates in Italy tend to increase with the duration of a relationship for banks other than cooperative banks. Cooperative bank members are also found to enjoy easier access to credit relative to non-member counterparts. Holmes et al. (2007) find that lowincome households with strong ties to a credit union are more likely to receive loans, despite poor credit histories compared to those at a community bank. Uchida et al. (2012) note that in Japan more soft information is produced by loan officers at smaller (Shinkin banks and credit cooperatives) banks. However, in contrast to conventional wisdom, they do not find clear evidence that loan officers at large banks are incapable of producing soft information and potentially underwriting relationship loans. Presbitero and Zazzaro (2011) find that where relationship lending techniques are already widely used by a large number of small mutual banks (credit cooperatives and savings banks) an increase in out-of-market competition drives the mutual banks to further cultivate their relationship ties with customers.",

Taylor (op. cit.) demonstrates that in a \"neutral credit union\" (where neither the interest of savers nor borrowers dominate) total benefits to members are maximised.

This is particularly so for credit unions which in most countries do not have the option to raise new capital in the form of equity and so are more likely to manage their capital cautiously over the course of the business cycle. Smith and Woodbury (2010) find that US credit unions are less sensitive to the business cycle than banks and should therefore be subject to lower capital requirements. Pana and Mukherjee (2010) find that higher levels of capital in US credit unions reduce their ability to create liquidity. Goddard et al. (2016) find that capital buffers for US credit unions vary pro-cyclically and until the financial crisis, credit unions classified as adequately capitalized or below followed a faster adjustment path than well-capitalized credit unions. This pattern reversed in the aftermath of the crisis. Hillier (2008) find that capital adequacy regulations on Australian credit unions resulted in the use of accounting window dressing techniques to increase capital adequacy. Brown and Davis (2009) find that Australian credit unions manage their capital positions by setting a target profit rate, positively related to asset growth. Lai (2017, 2018) find that Canadian credit union capital buffers behave counter cyclically and that they hold a capital buffer bigger than the maximum buffer advocated under Basel III. They also note that both the risk-based capital buffer and the leverage buffer are positively related to changes in loans and loan growth which underscores the importance of the Basel III conservation and the countercyclical buffer requirements in fostering credit.",

Using a large sample of commercial, savings and cooperative banks from 29 OECD countries, Hesse and \u010cihak (2007) find that while cooperative banks are less profitable and capitalized than commercial banks, they enjoy more stable returns. find that European cooperative banks are more stable than commercial banks during stressed periods. The opposite appears to be true under normal economic conditions.

Ely (2014) finds that credit unions with broader field-of-membership are less well capitalised and exhibit greater earnings volatility. For Australia, Esho et al.

Wilcox (2005) suggests that younger, smaller, and less well-capitalized credit unions are more likely to fail. Negative macroeconomic conditions are a likely contributory factor to failure. Smith and Woodbury (2010) find that credit unions are less exposed than banks to fluctuations in the business cycle. Goddard et al.

This latest phase is about the use of technology by new entrants to provide non-intermediated financial services directly to customers, (Consumers International, 2017) . The largest number of these new FinTech providers are in the payments, clearing and settlement sectors (mobile wallets, peer to peer transfers and digital currencies) followed by credit, deposit and capital-raising services (crowding funding, lending marketplaces, credit scoring, mobile banks) ( There are a number of implications of FinTech for cooperative financial institutions.

Following a monetary policy contraction, stakeholder banks decrease loan supply to a lesser extent than shareholder banks. A detailed analysis of the effect among stakeholder banks reveals that cooperative banks continued to smooth the impact of tighter monetary policy on their lending during the crisis period (2008-2011) whereas savings banks did not. 19 Meril\u00e4inen (2016) finds that both the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis caused a negative shock in Western European lending growth. The shock was weakened by stakeholder banks whose lending growth either did not decrease during the two crises or decreased substantially less than that of commercial banks. Migliorelli (2018) notes that cooperative banks lent proportionately more than other banks in Germany and other 16 Institutions sell white label products with their own branding, but a third party manufactures the products. 17 Since 2012, large banks have invested at least $4.1 billion in FinTech firms. 18 Kalmi (2009), Ostergaard et al.

Less positively, Maskara and Neymotin (2019) find that during the financial crisis, credit unions were no more likely than other depositary institutions to extend a home equity line of credit either in areas experiencing housing price declines or to lower income households. They suggest that these findings provide an empirical counterpoint to those who have lauded credit unions for providing liquidity during times of crisis or for serving consumers who would otherwise be challenged to obtain funds.",

Financial cooperatives play an important role in the financial systems of many countries around the world.

A not-for-profit orientation (in many cases) and a focus on maximising benefits to members has ensured the enduring popularity and sustainability of financial cooperatives. This is particularly evident since the global financial crisis when in many cases, financial cooperatives continued to extend credit to members as many profit-orientated commercial banks restricted credit to households and firms.",

It has highlighted the importance of relationship lending as a feature of business model development although questions whether this comparative advantage can maintain in the face of disruption from FinTech companies. The review has confirmed the complexities involved in balancing competing stakeholder interests but confirms that financial cooperatives achieve this balance better than most other organisational forms. Whether mergers generate scale and scope economies and whether members / customers benefit post-merger have been the subject of many papers. Consensus opinion is that scale economies do accrue however, member / customer benefits are transitory. 21 There are 195 countries in the world.",

Self-help: Cooperatives are member-owned and member-governed financial organisations that aim to achieve pre-determined economic and social objectives. Identity: A majority of cooperatives have a membership that is concentrated at a local or regional level and cater to the financial needs of individual members, community groups and small firms. Democracy: Each member has only one vote, irrespective of how many shares held. This reduces the ability of any one member or group of members to impose a controlling influence on the direction of the institution. Cooperation among cooperatives: Considered individually, financial cooperatives are often small. However, as they do not typically compete with each other (due to self-or regulatory-imposed limits on geographic spread), they have formed cooperative arrangements that have enabled them avail of scale and scope economies. In Europe, cooperative banks have developed prominent central institutions and formed network alliances. These networks range from loose associations to cohesive groups, and can be simple or complex multi-levelled structures Fonteyne, 2007) .",

First, transfers to reserves from profits is the main, if not only, source of capital accumulation for many cooperative financial institutions. 23 Second, as there is no externally held capital and no tradable ownership rights, cooperative institutions face no (or weak) discipline from the market in corporate ownership and control. Third, the one member one vote system arguably means that members have insufficient incentive to engage in monitoring as their ability to exercise control is weak and potential rewards are low. 24 In such circumstances, agency costs may be high and adversely affect efficiency and performance. In particular, management may have greater opportunity to indulge in discretionary expenditures and the pursuit of managerial emoluments (expense preference behaviour).",

Each unit has separate employees, processes, and cultures.

Cooperative bank members are also found to enjoy easier access to credit relative to non-member counterparts. Holmes et al. (2007) find that lowincome households with strong ties to a credit union are more likely to receive loans, despite poor credit histories compared to those at a community bank. Uchida et al. (2012) note that in Japan more soft information is produced by loan officers at smaller (Shinkin banks and credit cooperatives) banks. However, in contrast to conventional wisdom, they do not find clear evidence that loan officers at large banks are incapable of producing soft information and potentially underwriting relationship loans. Presbitero and Zazzaro (2011) find that where relationship lending techniques are already widely used by a large number of small mutual banks (credit cooperatives and savings banks) an increase in out-of-market competition drives the mutual banks to further cultivate their relationship ties with customers.",

This is particularly so for credit unions which in most countries do not have the option to raise new capital in the form of equity and so are more likely to manage their capital cautiously over the course of the business cycle. Smith and Woodbury (2010) find that US credit unions are less sensitive to the business cycle than banks and should therefore be subject to lower capital requirements. Pana and Mukherjee (2010) find that higher levels of capital in US credit unions reduce their ability to create liquidity. Goddard et al. (2016) find that capital buffers for US credit unions vary pro-cyclically and until the financial crisis, credit unions classified as adequately capitalized or below followed a faster adjustment path than well-capitalized credit unions. This pattern reversed in the aftermath of the crisis. Hillier (2008) find that capital adequacy regulations on Australian credit unions resulted in the use of accounting window dressing techniques to increase capital adequacy. Brown and Davis (2009) find that Australian credit unions manage their capital positions by setting a target profit rate, positively related to asset growth. Lai (2017, 2018) find that Canadian credit union capital buffers behave counter cyclically and that they hold a capital buffer bigger than the maximum buffer advocated under Basel III. They also note that both the risk-based capital buffer and the leverage buffer are positively related to changes in loans and loan growth which underscores the importance of the Basel III conservation and the countercyclical buffer requirements in fostering credit.",

(2014) find that local cooperative banks in Poland lend more to small businesses than large domestic and foreignowned banks. Ferri et al. (2014 Ferri et al. ( , 2015 analyse differences in lending policies across stakeholder and shareholder EU banks to detect possible variations in bank lending supply responses to changes in monetary policy. Following a monetary policy contraction, stakeholder banks decrease loan supply to a lesser extent than shareholder banks. A detailed analysis of the effect among stakeholder banks reveals that cooperative banks continued to smooth the impact of tighter monetary policy on their lending during the crisis period (2008-2011) whereas savings banks did not. 41 Meril\u00e4inen (2016) finds that both the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis caused a negative shock in Western European lending growth. The shock was weakened by stakeholder banks whose lending growth either did not decrease during the two crises or decreased substantially less than that of commercial banks. Migliorelli (2018) notes that cooperative banks lent proportionately more than other banks in Germany and other 38 Institutions sell white label products with their own branding, but a third party manufactures the products. 39 Since 2012, large banks have invested at least $4.1 billion in FinTech firms. 40 Jones and Kalmi (2009), Ostergaard et al.

Financial cooperatives play an important role in the financial systems of many countries around the world. They act as a safe haven for deposits and are major sources of credit for households and small-and medium-sized firms. A not-for-profit orientation (in many cases) and a focus on maximising benefits to members has ensured the enduring popularity and sustainability of financial cooperatives. This is particularly evident since the global financial crisis when in many cases, financial cooperatives continued to extend credit to members as many profit-orientated commercial banks restricted credit to households and firms.",

It has highlighted the importance of relationship lending as a feature of business model development although questions whether this comparative advantage can maintain in the face of disruption from FinTech companies. The review has confirmed the complexities involved in balancing competing stakeholder interests but confirms that financial cooperatives achieve this balance better than most other organisational forms. Whether mergers generate scale and scope economies and whether members / customers benefit post-merger have been the subject of many papers. Consensus opinion is that scale economies do accrue however, member / customer benefits are transitory. 43 There are 195 countries in the world.",

Second, as membership is structured around a common identity usually based on geographic location, information asymmetry (adverse selection) is reduced leading to better loan decisions, as borrowers are less able to under-represent risk. Furthermore, as borrowers have social and business connections through the common identity to other members there may be large informal costs of reneging on loan repayments thus enabling social capital to be used as \"collateral\" in lending and in so doing reduce moral hazard(Guinnaine, 2001;Fonteyne and Hardy, 2011).Third, depositors (as owners) are likely to maintain savings in periods of economic uncertainty thus ensuring retail funding stability. Fourth, given that employee remuneration is not linked directly to profits or share option arrangements, this may encourage management to be more circumspect in their behaviours relative to management in shareholder-owned banks(van Rijn et al., 2019).",

Alphonse Desjardins (1854-1921), first a journalist and then a parliamentary reporter, moved by the victimization of the poor by loan sharks established the first caisse populaire (people\"s bank) in 1900 in his home town of L\u00e9vis in Quebec. He proceeded to set up a further 150 over the next fifteen years (MacPherson, 1979, Mook et al., 2015). Desjardins helped establish the first US credit cooperative in Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1908. This was based around a Franco-American parish administered by Monsignor Pierre Hevey and it initially served French-speaking immigrants to Manchester from the Maritime Provinces of Canada. (Moody and Fite, 1984; Walter, 2006). The mantle for credit cooperatives in the US was then taken up by Pierre Jay (1870-1949), the commissioner of Banks in Massachusetts, and Edward Filene (1860-1937), a Boston businessman and philanthropist. These individuals promoted and were instrumental in the passing of the Massachusetts Credit Union Enabling Act in 1909, the first credit union legislation in the US. A further person of influence in the US was Roy Bergengren (1879-1955) who along with Filene formed the Credit Union National Extension Bureau which was tasked with lobbying for credit union legislation at both State and Federal level. In 1934, the Federal Credit Union Act was passed. This Act encapsulated much of Bergengren\"s interpretation of what credit unions are, how they should be structured and how they operate in law.",

The number of Shinkumi banks have fallen steadily over recent years and at the end of 2019, there were 145 such institutions. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Fischer (2005) provides cross-country evidence which suggests that integrated cooperative banking systems reduces both performance volatility and expense preference behaviour at financial cooperatives. The authors conclude that integrated systems are more efficient and economise on bounded rationality. 28 Network arrangements in credit unions are most commonly characterised by the so-called atomised model. This involves relatively loose integration of member credit unions, which is generally limited to representation, lobbying and public relations (Ayadi, 2019). A notable exception is the credit union movement in Canada where Desjardins caisses populaire operate along the lines of a complex federated model. The individual caisse are independent and autonomously incorporated entities, but operate in a structured, standardised and closely inter-connected environment (McMurtry and Brouard, 2015). The Desjardins federated structure provides significant economies of scale and both industry presence and profile in the marketplace (Levasseur and Rousseau, 2002). In other jurisdictions such as the US, credit unions form Credit Union Services Organisations (CUSOs) which are limited liability companies to facilitate shared services. Some CUSOs involve cooperation among a small number of credit unions, while others involve large numbers of credit unions that enter and exit the CUSO as circumstances change. CUSOs allow credit unions to achieve economies of scale and engage in activities that individual institutions may regard as too costly or risky, or that are prohibited by regulations",
