To accelerate this process, we present a deep learning based generative modeling framework, CogMol, to design drug candidates specific to a given target protein sequence with high off-target selectivity. We augment this generative framework with an in silico screening process that accounts for toxicity, to lower the failure rate of the generated drug candidates in later stages of the drug development pipeline. We apply this framework to three relevant proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, namely nonstructural protein 9 (NSP9) replicase, main protease, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Docking to the target proteins demonstrate the potential of these generated molecules as ligands. Structural similarity analyses further imply novelty of the generated molecules with respect to the training dataset as well as possible biological association of a number of generated molecules that might be of relevance to COVID-19 therapeutic design. While the validation of these molecules is underway, we release \u223c 3000 novel COVID-19 drug candidates generated using our framework.",

The task aims at creating new molecules (or, optimize known molecules) with multiple desirable properties, that are often competing and tightly interacting with each other. For example, optimal drug molecules should be easy to synthesize, have binding affinity to a specific target protein of interest, low binding affinity to other targets, while also exhibiting high drug likeliness (QED). This makes drug discovery a costly (2-3 billion USD) and a time-consuming process (more than a decade) with a low success rate (less than 10%).",

A particular challenge of SMILES-based generative approaches is to ensure that the generated strings are syntactically valid under SMILES grammar. [Kusner et al., 2017] and [Dai et al., 2018] added grammar constraints to SMILES strings to improve the chemical validity of the generated molecules. Unfortunately, this approach also suffers from several shortcomings. For example, the models are not permutation-invariant of their node labels, the training has a quadratic complexity concerning the number of nodes, and generating semantically valid graphs is challenging. [Jin et al., 2018] is considered as a state-of-the-art architecture in this context, which represents a molecular graph as fragments (such as rings and atom branches) connected in a tree structure. Among GAN-based approaches, [De Cao and Kipf, 2018] introduced MolGAN, a GAN trained with reinforcement learning (RL) for generating molecular graphs.",

Although the AUC values are slightly worse than the existing work of [Liu et al., 2019 , see Table  S14 ], the precision (and thus true positive rate) achieved by the MT-DNN is much higher. 2 For comparison, we also report the results from a random forest (RF) model in Table 6 , showing that the MT-DNN significantly outperforms the RF model in terms of true positive rate, recall, and F1 score.

(Figure 7) . For each of these binding pockets in a target, we calculated the binding free energies for all of the molecules specific to that target: average (\u00b1 standard deviation) over all generated molecules, minimum binding free energy in kcal/mol over all generated molecules, the fraction of generated molecules with binding free energy \u2264 \u22126 kcal/mol. 88%, 94%, and 96% of generated molecules showed a binding free energy of \u2264 \u22126 kcal/mol for at least one of the binding pockets in the specific target. To investigate the possible binding mode of the generated molecules with the target protein, we performed docking of the generated molecules against the potential binding sites (Figure 7 ) as predicted using PrankWeb [Kriv\u00e1k and Hoksza, 2018, Jendele et al., 2019] within the target structure using Autodock Vina [Trott and Olson, 2010] . Table 3 summarizes preliminary results from these docking runs. In the lowest energy docking mode, 88%, 94%, and 96% of generated molecules showed a binding free energy of \u2264 \u22126 kcal/mol for at least one of the binding pockets in NSP9 dimer, Main Protease, and RBD, respectively. We also report the average and minimum binding free energy, as well as the fraction of generated molecules with a binding free energy of \u2264 -6 kcal/mol for each pocket (Table 3 ). Figure 8 shows the best generated molecule (with lowest binding free energy) docked to a binding pocket in the target structure.

For example, the molecule with Pubchem Compound ID (CID) 76332092 (labeled GEN _CRBD_146 in the data download) is a known Plasmepsin-2 and Plasmepsin-4 inhibitor. Plasmepsin family of proteins is a potential target for antimalarial drugs due to their haemoglobin-degrading activity. CID 76332092 has also shown antimalarial activity against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 infected in RBV after 72 hrs. Given that RBD from S protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor is needed for viral entry to host cells [Hoffmann et al., 2020] , both RBD and ACE-2 receptor are being actively investigated as COVID-19 targets. Chloroquine (and its hydroxy derivative) that is a known ACE-2 inhibitor has been already considered as a promising COVID-19 drug [Liu et al., 2020] . Given that chloroquine is also an anti-malaria drug, and that CID 76332092 shows a predicted pIC50 of 7.82 and lowest docking binding free energy of -6.80 kcal/mol (Figure 9 ) to the ACE-2 binding pocket of RBD (Table 4) , this molecule deserves further investigation in the context of SARS-CoV-2. It is also noteworthy that the generated molecule with highest predicted pIC50 for RBD (and with docking binding free energy of -6.9 kcal/mol in the top binding mode with pocket 1) shares a strong maximum common subgraph similarity [Cao et al., 2008] with Telavancin, an approved Pneumonia drug, as shown in Figure 6 . These results indicate that CogMol can generate promising and biologically relevant drug candidates beyond the training dataset.
