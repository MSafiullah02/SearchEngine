            "text": "In the study of epidemiology, finding ways to prevent the outbreak of an epidemic disease\nis always an important issue. In the past few decades, several effective immunization\nstrategies have been proposed to minimize the risk of the outbreak of epidemic diseases on\ncomplex networks.2,5,8\u201316 Recently, the study of aspects of human responses towards\nthe spread of epidemic diseases has drawn much attention4,7,17\u201328\ndue to the fact that the change of individual behaviors has an effect on the epidemic\ndynamics. In the literature,4,18,29,30 according to the source of information, awareness is\nclassified into three types, which are termed contact awareness, local awareness, and global\nawareness. For the first type, it is assumed4,29 that individuals with larger contact number in a network are\nmore willing to change their behavior in order to reduce the risk of being infected. The\nsecond one is based on personal local information or local infection density.4,18 The third one is based on the global\ninfection density in a whole community.4,31 The information relating to that may come from national media,\ne.g., public health authorities. In this work, we shall further differentiate each of the\nthree types of awareness into two cases: infection awareness and immunization awareness.\nPeople with infection awareness are more likely to take extra steps to avoid infection,\nwhile people with immunization awareness increase likelihood for getting vaccinated. It\nshould also be noted that in heterogeneous networks such as scale-free (SF) ones, the effect\nof these three types of awareness cannot be separated completely. Such combined effect is\nalso addressed in Ref. 4.",

Our main results contain the\nfollowing. First, the epidemic threshold is explicitly obtained. In particular, if\nimmunization awareness is considered and vaccination has a perfect success, then the\nepidemic dies out eventually regardless of what other factors are or what initial conditions\nare. Furthermore, such threshold depends on the contact type of awareness and local\ninfection awareness, and is independent of all the other types of awareness. Such result\nindeed suggests that the effect of these three types of awareness against the outbreak of an\nepidemic disease in decreasing order in terms of their importance is contact awareness,\nlocal awareness, and global awareness. Second, we compare the epidemic threshold for the\nhomogeneous network, where individuals have roughly the same degree (contact number), and\nthe heterogeneous network, where individuals' degree distribution has a heavy tail. We show\nthat the epidemic threshold for the homogeneous network can be lower than that of the\nheterogeneous network in an interval J of intensity of contact infection\nawareness, while it is higher otherwise. In certain extreme cases, the interval\nJ is empty or infinite.",

            "text": "In this section, we shall depict the epidemic spreading model under consideration. We begin\nwith the formulation based on probabilistic discrete-time Markov chains. It is assumed that\neach individual, at each time t, is in one of the following three discrete\nstates: infectious (I), vaccinated (V), and susceptible\n(S), and each could transfer its state at time t to a\nnew one at time t + 1 through one of the following four different ways: (i) S\u2192I, (ii) S\u2192V, (iii) V\u2192S, and (iv) I\u2192S. Letting pi(t)\n(respectively, qi(t)), i=1,\u2026,N, be the probability that a\nnode i is infectious (respectively, vaccinated) at time t,\nour model under consideration reads as follows: (1)pi(t+1)=(1\u2212\u03b3)pi(t)+[1\u2212pi(t)\u2212qi(t)]Probi(S\u2192I),qi(t+1)=(1\u2212\u03b4)qi(t)+[1\u2212pi(t)\u2212qi(t)]Probi(S\u2192V),(1a)where Probi(S\u2192I)=1\u2212[1\u2212\u03bb\u03c8(ki)(1\u2212\u03b2p(t))(1\u2212\u03b1siki)]si,(1b)\nProbi(S\u2192V)=1\u2212\u03c8~(ki)(1\u2212\u03b2~p(t))(1\u2212\u03b1~siki).(1c)Here ki denotes the degree\nof a node i (i.e., the number of neighbors of a node i);\nsi, ranging from 0 to ki,\ndenotes the number of infectious neighbors of a node i; and\np(t) denotes the fraction of infectious nodes in the\nnetwork. For other parameters and terms in (1a)\u2013(1c), their epidemic meanings\nare explained in the following list. (I)The parameter \u03b3\u2208[0,1] in\n(1a) denotes the recovering\nprobability for infectious individuals for the whole time\nperiod.(II)The parameter \u03b4\u2208[0,1] in\n(1a) denotes the probability of\nvaccine failure for vaccinated individuals.(III)The term Probi(S\u2192I),\ndefined in (1b), gives the probability\nthat a node i changes its state from S to\nI. The quantity \u03bb\u2208[0,1]\ndenotes the spreading rate for which an infectious node would\nactually transmit a disease through an edge connecting to a susceptible node.32,33\n(i)The term \u03c8(ki)\nin (1b) describes the contact\nawareness to avoid infection for a node i,4,29 which is to be termed as the\ncontact infection awareness in short. Similar usage of the\nterm is to be followed. We assume that a node with a higher degree is aware of\nthe higher risk to be infected and, consequently, it increases its protection\nand hence reduces the probability of getting infected. Thus, it is assumed that\nfunction \u03c8(k)\nis decreasing in the degree k. In Ref. 4, \u03c8(k)\nis chosen to be k\u2212b\nfor some nonnegative constant b. The larger the quantity\nb is, the smaller the \u03c8(k)\nand the term defined in (1b) is,\nand hence the less likely a susceptible individual would get infected. The\nconstant b is to be termed as the intensity of contact\ninfection awareness. Note that, if \u03c8(k)\nis independent of k (i.e., b = 0), then there\nis no contact infection awareness in the epidemic spreading.(ii)The term (1\u2212\u03b2p(t)) in (1b) is a decreasing function of\np(t) and \u03b2. Thus, this term\nindicates that, as the infectious density p(t)\nin the population increases, one increases its protection and hence reduces the\nprobability of getting infected. And so, this term represents the global\ninfection awareness.30,34 Clearly, such setup indicates that people are made\naware of the epidemic disease through national media. Moreover, \u03b2\u2208[0,1]\ndescribes the strength of the average risk assessment from global awareness and\nhence \u03b2 is to be termed as the intensity of global\ninfection awareness. For \u03b2 = 0, this means that\nglobal infection awareness is not considered in the epidemic\nspreading.(iii)The term (1\u2212\u03b1(si/ki))\nin (1b) is a decreasing function\nof (si/ki)\nand \u03b1. Thus, this term indicates that as the local infectious\ndensity (si/ki)\nof a node i increases, one increases its protection and hence\nreduces the probability of getting infected. And so, this term represents the\nlocal infection awareness.5,30,34 The parameter \u03b1\u2208[0,1]\nindicates the strength of the average risk assessment from local awareness, and\nhence \u03b1 is to be termed as the intensity of local\ninfection awareness. Note that \u03b1 = 0 means that\nthere is no local infection awareness in the epidemic spreading.(iv)The term [1\u2212\u03bb\u03c8(ki)(1\u2212\u03b2p(t))(1\u2212\u03b1siki)],represents the probability that a susceptible node i will not\nget infected when it makes a contact with exactly one\ninfectious individual. Thus [1\u2212\u03bb\u03c8(ki)(1\u2212\u03b2p(t))(1\u2212\u03b1siki)]si,is the probability that a node i will not change its state\nfrom susceptible to infectious when it makes contacts with\nsi infectious individuals. Thus, Probi(S\u2192I), defined in (1b), gives the probability that a\nnode i changes its state from susceptible to\ninfectious.(IV)The term Probi(S\u2192V),\ndefined in (1c), gives the probability\nthat a node i changes its state from S to\nV when the epidemic disease is spreading.5\n(i)Similarly, the term \u03c8~(ki)\nin (1c) describes the contact\nawareness to get immunized, which is to be termed as the contact\nimmunization awareness in short. Similar usage of the term is to be\nfollowed. We assume that a node with a higher degree is aware of the higher risk\nto be infected, and it is more likely to get vaccinated to reduce the\nprobability of getting infected. Thus, it is assumed that function \u03c8~(k)\nis decreasing in k. We also set \u03c8~(k)=k\u2212b~\nfor some nonnegative constant b~,\nwhere the parameter b~ is\nto be termed as the intensity of contact immunization\nawareness. That is, for higher b~, a\nsusceptible individual tends to have a higher probability of getting\nvaccinated.(ii)The terms (1\u2212\u03b2~p(t)) and \u03b2~\u2208[0,1]\nin (1c) describe the\nglobal immunization awareness and the intensity of\nglobal immunization awareness, respectively. Note that Probi(S\u2192V)\nis increasing in \u03b2~.\nConsequently, for higher \u03b2~, a\nsusceptible individual is more likely to get vaccinated.(iii)The term (1\u2212\u03b1~(si/ki))\nin (1c) represents the\nprobability that a node i changes its state from susceptible to\nvaccinated due to its local awareness. Note that Probi(S\u2192V)\nis increasing in \u03b1~.\nLikewise, (1\u2212\u03b1~(si/ki))\nand the constant \u03b1~\u2208[0,1]\nare called local immunization awareness and the\nintensity of local immunization awareness,\nrespectively.",

We also point out that,\nif the vaccine success is perfect and immunization awareness is introduced, then the\nepidemic would eventually die out (see No. 10 in Table II). The time series simulation for the cases in Table II are given in Fig. 1.",
