They vary in size from 76 to 109 amino acids. The protein is associated with the ER and Golgi complex, and can be translocated to the surface of the infected cells [4], [16], [23], [26], [27]. Functionally, coronavirus E protein plays a pivotal role in viral morphogenesis, assembly and budding. Co-expression of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) E and M was shown to result in the production of virus-like particles, roughly the same size and shape as virions [18], [31]. The same phenomena were also observed in other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [5], [9]. When the E protein was expressed in mammalian cells on its own, the E-containing vesicles can be produced and released to the culture medium [5], [19]. Furthermore, MHV and SARS-CoV E proteins were shown to induce apoptosis [1], [32]. More recently, the SARS-CoV E protein was found to permeabilize bacterial cells as well as to form pores in artificial membranes [14], [15], [31]. It was also reported that MHV E protein could modify the membrane permeability in both Escherchia coli and mammalian cells [18].",

            "text": "Despite the similarities in biochemical properties and biological functions, the E protein from different coronaviruses shares very low homology in the primary amino acid sequence [18]. Another striking feature is that different coronavirus E proteins assume distinct membrane topologies. Based on cell surface staining with a C-terminus-specific antibody, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) E protein was demonstrated to have a CexoNcyto membrane topology [8]. The IBV E protein is accessible to a C-terminus-specific antibody in the presence of either digitonin or Triton X-100 but is accessible to an N-terminus-specific antibody only in the presence of Triton X-100, suggesting that IBV E protein may possess an NexoCcyto topology [4]. Immunofluorescence analysis of cells expressing MHV E protein demonstrated that its transmembrane domain spans the lipid bilayer twice, indicating that both the N- and C-terminal regions are exposed to the cytoplasm (NcytoCcyto) [20], [26]. The putative transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV E protein has been reported to adopt a highly unusual topology, consisting of a very short transmembrane helical hairpin [2], with Phe23 as the center of inversion of the hairpin. This residue was suggested to be located at the center of the bilayer [2], although a more recent report places this residue adjacent to the polar head groups of the lipids [11]. However, in silico [28] and in vitro NMR and infrared dichroic data (unpublished results) are in contrast with this model and are consistent with a normal transmembrane helix. In addition, the membrane orientation of the protein is yet to be determined.",

However, a minor proportion of the protein is found to be posttranslationally modified by N-linked glycosylation on the asparagine 66 residue.

Digestion with the non-specific proteinase K would degrade proteins (or a portion of the protein) protruding from the exterior face of the microsomal membranes, while proteins (or a portion of the protein) orientated towards the lumen are protected. For this purpose, HeLa cells expressing the Flag-tagged SARS-CoV E protein at either N- or C-terminus were broken by homogenization, and the membrane fraction was collected. The membrane fraction was then divided into three aliquots: one was treated with both 1% Triton X-100 and 20 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K, one treated with 20 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K only, and one without any treatment. The total proteins were then separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-Flag antibody. As shown in Fig. 3\n, efficient detection of both N- and C-terminally tagged SARS-CoV E protein was obtained from the untreated membrane fraction (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4). Upon treatment of the membrane fraction with 20 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, no detection of the SARS-CoV E protein was observed from cells expressing either the N- or C-terminally tagged E protein (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 6), demonstrating that treatment with proteinase K led to the removal of the Flag tag from either terminus of the SARS-CoV E protein. Similar results were observed after treatment of the membrane fraction with 20 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K in the absence of 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 5). However, prolonged exposure of the same gel showed detection of minor amounts of the E protein in the same fractions (data not shown).",

In the presence of 1% Triton X-100, treatment of the membrane fraction with proteinase K showed that no full-length PDI was detected (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 6, 9 and 12). However, the shorter form of PDI was still detected (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 6, 9 and 12), suggesting that it may represent a proteinase K-resistant fragment of PDI. The fact that the shorter form of PDI was detected in the membrane fraction after treatment with 20 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K in the absence of 1% Triton X-100 suggests that the procedure used to prepare the membrane fraction may result in partial disruption of the microsomes. In the same experiment, \u03b2-tubulin was also included as an internal control for the degradation of cytosolic proteins. The protein was degraded by the treatment with 20 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 3). Together with the immunofluorescence studies, these results confirm that both the N-terminus and C-terminus of SARS-CoV E are cytosolic with an orientation of NcytoCcyto.",

If the protein adopted a sole NcytoCcyto topology, glycosylation at the two positions would not occur. However, multiple bands were usually detected when the protein was expressed in different systems, suggesting that it may undergo posttranslational modifications. To address the possibility that the protein may be modified by N-linked glycosylation, mutations were introduced into the E protein to change the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites from asparagine to aspartic acid. Two mutants, N48-D and N66-D, were generated and expressed (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of cells expressing wild type and the N48-D mutant showed the detection of three bands on an SDS\u201317.5% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4\nA, lanes 1 and 2). These may represent three isoforms of the E protein. In cells expressing the N66-D mutant, only two bands were detected; the most slowly migrating species of the three isoforms was not observed (Fig. 4A, lane 3).",

The total cell lysates were first treated with the N-linked glycosidase PNGaseF, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-E polyclonal antibodies. In cells expressing wild type and the N48-D mutant E protein, the protein was separated into two major bands in the gel system used (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3). Treatment of the same total cell lysates led to the removal of the upper band (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4), confirming that it represents the glycosylated form of the protein. In this gel system, the two unglycosylated isoforms of wild type SARS-CoV E protein were not well separated, so three major bands were detected with Flag-SARS E but only two major bands detected with wild type SARS-CoV E. In addition, a minor species of approximately 20 kDa, representing the dimeric form of the protein, was observed in cells expressing the two constructs (Fig. 4B, lanes 1\u20134). In cells expressing the N66-D mutant, the glycosylated form was not detected either before or after treatment with PNGaseF (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, in cells expressing this mutant E protein, more dimeric form and a species representing trimers of the E protein were detected (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). It suggests that this mutant E protein tends to form multimers or aggregates. As a control, cells expressing IBV E protein were treated with the same glycosidase. The protein was detected as a single band in total cell lysates with or without PNGaseF treatment (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). In cells expressing the Flag-tagged E protein, this treatment resulted in the disappearance of the most slowly migrating species of the three isoforms (Fig. 4B, lanes 9 and 10), further confirming that it is the glycosylated form of the E protein. It was noted that the pattern of the Flag-tagged E protein present in this figure was different from that in Fig. 3. This is because that much more materials were loaded and prolonged electrophoresis of the gel was applied in order to separate well and to detect clearly the minor glycosylated form of the protein. These results demonstrate that a minor proportion of the SARS-CoV E protein is modified by N-linked glycosylation and the N66 residue is the site for this modification. More importantly, it suggests that this portion of the SARS-CoV E protein would assume a different membrane topology from the majority of the E protein, i.e., the C-terminal region of the protein would be located in the lumen of the ER and the Golgi apparatus.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses encode a small integral membrane protein that is associated with the viral envelope and plays important functions in virion assembly and morphogenesis [19], [30]. Recently, the E protein from SARS-CoV and MHV was shown to enhance the membrane permeability of bacterial and mammalian cells to small molecules [14], [15], [18]. SARS-CoV E protein contains a putative long transmembrane domain of 29 amino acid residues. Based on the distribution of the charged amino acids flanking the transmembrane domain and the recent observation that the E protein is palmitoylated on all three cysteine residues [15], the protein may insert into the ER and Golgi membranes with an Nexo(lum)Ccyto orientation. In vitro results reported by Arbely et al. suggest that the transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV may adopt a highly unusual topology, consisting of a short transmembrane helical hairpin that forms an inversion about a previously unidentified pseudo-centre of symmetry [2], although this is in contrast with simulation results based on phylogenetic data [28]. In the present study, the membrane topology of the SARS-CoV E protein is systematically studied with N- and C-terminally Flag-tagged SARS-CoV E protein. As the Flag tag does not affect the release of E-containing vesicles and virus-like particles (data not shown), and the permeabilizing activity of the protein, it is assumed that the Flag-tagged E protein is functionally active. Immunofluorescent staining of cells differentially permeabilized with detergents and proteinase K protection assay revealed that both the N- and C-termini of the SARS-CoV E protein are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membranes (NcytoCcyto) (see Fig. 6\nA). Two potential forms are proposed (Fig. 6A, forms (1) and (2)). Based on Arbely et al. [2], the SARS-CoV E protein may assume the form (1) topology. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the protein may cross the membrane twice and assume the form (2) topology, based on our biophysical and molecular simulation data [28]. Consistent with previous studies, parallel experimental data presented in this study demonstrated that the IBV E protein spans the membranes once with the N-terminus exposed luminally and the C-terminus exposed cytoplasmically (Nexo(lum)Ccyto) (see Fig. 6A).",

Glycosylation of the C-terminal region of the E protein was an unexpected finding, since no proteinase K-protected fragment was detected in the limited proteinase K assay. Nevertheless, the detection of the N-linked glycosylation at the C-terminal region and the inefficient synthesis of the glycosylated form suggest that the SARS-CoV E protein may have an alternative membrane topology. Two possible models for this alternative membrane topology of the SARS-CoV E protein were proposed (Fig. 6B). In the first case, the protein may span the membranes once with an NcytoCexo(lum) orientation (Fig. 6B). Alternatively, both N- and C-termini may be exposed to the luminal side of the membranes (Nexo(lum)Cexo(lum)) (Fig. 6B). Once again, two potential forms are proposed (Fig. 6B, form (1) and (2)). At present, we cannot sort out which form is more likely the membrane topology for this portion of the E protein, as neither the full-length nor a shorter form of the protein was detected in the limited proteinase K assay probably due to the reason that only a very small proportion of protein assumes this topology.",

There are a few examples of viral proteins that adopt more than one membrane topology. These include the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus membrane protein [6], the fusion protein F from the Newcastle disease virus [21] and the adenovirus E3, a 6.7K protein [22]. As coronavirus E protein including SARS-CoV E protein is a multi-functional protein, it would be important to establish whether different topological forms are responsible for a distinct function. The SARS-CoV E protein was found to interact with Bcl-xL [32]. As this interaction was mediated by the C-terminal BH3-like region of the E protein, it would require that the C-terminal part of the protein is exposed to the cytoplasm [32]. The C-terminal tail of the IBV E protein is important for its interaction with the M protein during virus budding [5]. It is therefore likely that the NcytoCcyto form of the E protein may be the form that accomplishes these functions.",

In this study, however, we were unable to detect efficiently cell surface expression of the SARS-CoV E protein in cells expressing the protein under non-permeabilizing conditions. This would be an additional line of evidence that indirectly supports the conclusion that the majority of the SARS-CoV E protein adopts an NcytoCcyto topology in cells.

The fourth membrane-associated structural protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), in some coronaviruses is also a glycoprotein [23]. So far, the E protein is an apparent exception. In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV E protein is also modified by N-linked glycosylation. In N-linked glycosylation, the oligosaccharides are added to specific asparagine residues in the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr. The minimum distance between a functional C-terminal glycosylation acceptor site and the luminal end of the transmembrane domain is 12\u201313 residues [24], suggesting that only the most C-proximal asparagine residue out of the two potential sites in the SARS-CoV E protein can be glycosylated. Consistent with this observation, mutagenesis studies present in this paper confirmed that only N66 is modified. Furthermore, we also show that a potential N-linked glycosylation site in the N-terminal region of the IBV E protein (N6), which is 6 amino acids upstream of the transmembrane domain, was not modified, although the N-terminal region of this protein is exposed to the luminal side of the membranes.",

In the early secretory pathway, the glycans also play a role in protein folding, quality control and certain sorting events. However, N-linked glycosylation seems not to affect the membrane-association and membrane-permeabilizing activity of the SARS-CoV E protein. To further characterize the functional significance of this modification, it would be interesting to test if N-linked glycosylation of SARS-CoV E protein can also be detected in virus-infected cells and in purified virions. As the N66 residue is not conserved in the E protein of other coronaviruses, it is likely that this modification may render unique features to the SARS-CoV E protein. Further exploration of the functions and effects of this modification on SARS-CoV E protein using an infectious cloning system may shed new light on the molecular biology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.",
