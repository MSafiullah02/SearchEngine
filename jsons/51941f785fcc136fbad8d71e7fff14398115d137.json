New types are acquired generally by an oral route. Some E coli are pathogenic and some may have a far more enhanced ability to colonise the human intestine than most others. Recently enterohaemorrhagic E coli have emerged. They can cause a number of intestinal illnesses in humans including bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. These organisms produce a number of virulence factors particularly the Shiga-like toxins (verotoxins). The intestines of animals may be the reservoir of these organisms for human infection, and cattle particularly have been shown to harbour them. Food, especially undercooked meat products, have been associated with a number of outbreaks throughout the world. While a certain serotype 0157.H7 has been associated with many outbreaks throughout the world, other serotypes, particularly 011l.H-, have also been reported. This latter serotype appears to be more common in Australia. A U S~ Vet J 73: 20 -26",

            "text": "Over a century ago Escherich described the bacteria that he isolated from the faeces of human neonates as Bacterium coli commune Escherich 1988) . He demonstrated that the organisms now known as Escherichia cofi were present in the faeces and intestinal contents of humans and were considered as commensal organisms. The biochemical tests that are the substance of modem bacterial taxonomy were developed over the ensuing decades and became the basis of the taxonomy of the enterobacteriaceae in general and E coli in particular. Kauffmann (1947) established the serotyping of E coli, which permitted the far greater understanding of the ecology of these bacteria. Besides being subdivided into serotypes, E coli can also be subdivided into biotypes by their antibiotic resistance patterns (Crichton and Old 1992) and isoenzyme patterns (Goullet and Picard 1986) . The clonal nature of E coli has been specifically addressed (Achtman 1985; Whittam 1989) . Although E coli are the most extensively studied organisms from the faeces of humans and animals, they comprise only a very small percentage of the total faecal flora. Mitsuoka and Hayakawa (1972) estimated the enterobacterial flora of human faeces to range from values of lo8 to 1O'/g whereas the total bacterial flora was around lO'O/g. Over the last 15 years a number of pathogenic groups of E coli that affect both humans and animals has been described, especially the enterohaemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) . They have been associated with many cases and outbreaks of severe diarrhoea often including haemolytic uraemic syndrome and sometimes causing death. These EHEC occur normally in the gut of domestic animals and food may be the main vehicle of transmission to humans. This review examines the emergence of EHEC as pathogens to humans.",

Isolates from most mothers and their babies were of the same 0 group. Where E cofi was cultured from the mucus, the isolates tended to comprise an intermediate distribution of 0 groups between the faecal cultures from the mother and her baby. The variety of 0 serogroups isolated from some but not all motherhaby pairs was greatest in maternal faeces, least in the baby's faeces and intermediate in the baby's mucus. By increasing the number of phenotypic characters of E coli examined (Bettelheim et af 1974b) . the transmission of E coli during birth was further demonstrated. Some of the characteristics of the E cofi were either lost or gained during such transmission, suggesting that there must be some environmental pressure on these organisms (O'Farrell and Bettelheim 1976; Shinebaum et a1 1977) .",

            "text": "Direct ingestion of E coli in food is most likely the source of human colonisation. Animal carcases are generally contaminated with their intestinal E coli, even under very good conditions in the slaughterhouse (Shooter et a1 1970) . There is extensive interchange of E coli between carcases as well. In another study (Bettelheim 1981 ) on a sheep slaughtering line in an abattoir in New Zealand, the animal's own rectal E coli tended to be washed away during the very heavy hosing down, after the removal of the intestines. However, the carcases were recontaminated by other E coli from the environment, which presumably were derived from the intestines of animals slaughtered previously. The spread of both E coli and antibiotic resistance markers was quite extensive despite the high hygienic standard of this abattoir. A poultry packing station was also investigated as part of the studies of Shooter et a1 (1970, 1974) . E coli could be isolated from the chickens and their giblets throughout the processing stages. They were also isolated from the various waters used in the feather softening processes and cooling tanks. An extensive study of the contamination of pig carcases in two abattoirs (Linton et a1 1976) found some E coli 0 serogroups throughout the stages of the slaughtering process, while others were isolated only intermittently. A generally high level of antibiotic resistance was found among the isolates. It was suggested that this reflected the state of pig rearing at that time because the pigs came from a variety of sources. The isolates did survive the chilling process and thus could be considered as potential sources of human colonisation. Although most of these studies were carried out around 20 years ago, and there have been no studies in modem abattoirs, the continuing high infection rate with Gram-negative enteric pathogens, including now E coli 0157 and other EHEC, suggests that this contamination is still continuing. E coli in Food Cooke eta1 (1970) examined the contamination of hospital food by E coli and demonstrated a strong correlation between the faecal serotypes and those contaminating the food ingested by the patients. There appeared to be a continuous flux of E coli between the patients' food entering the ward environment and their faeces. In a survey of over 4000 samples of retail processed foods in the UK, Pinegar and Cooke (1985) noted an overall carriage rate of 12% of E coli. More than 25% of the cakes and confectionery and only 9% of meat and meat-based products were contaminated. These isolates from meat products were more likely to be antibiotic resistant. Over lo3 E colilg food were isolated from 27% of foods. (1977) demonstrated that some isolates of E coli were able to produce a cytotoxin, which was active on Vero cells, which are derived from the kidney of a normal adult African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops). These verotoxins (VT) are distinct from both the heat labile (LT) and heat stable (ST) enterotoxins, produced by enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC). They had originally been found to be produced by a number of EPEC serogroups, particularly 0 2 6 and 0 1 1 1, but not by all EPEC serogroups. Verotoxigenic E coli are known as VTEC. Since then it has been established that most EPEC do not produce VT. EPEC are characterised by the production of attachment-effacement lesions on the intestinal mucosa of susceptible animals (Moon et a1 1983) and the EPEC attachment factor (EAF) (Knutton et a1 1989) . These characteristics are quite distinct and having been shown to be present even in archetypal strains (Robins-Browne et a1 1993) absolutely differentiate the EPEC from the VT-producing E coli, although some may belong to the same 0-groups. The enterohaemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) are those types that produce specific adherence factors in addition to the VT.",

Many studies including those of Carter et a1 (1987) and Scotland et a1 (1988) have linked this condition with VT-producing E coli. Prodromal bloody diarrhoea, which occurs mainly in children, has been reported both as outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis (Riley et a1 1983) and as sporadic cases (Pai et a1 1984) .

In the original study it was described as a \"rare\" serotype. As a result of this and other studies 0rskov et a1 (1987) re-examined isolates of E coli belonging to the 0157 group that had been submitted to the International Escherichia and Klebsiella Centre since the establishment of this 0-group. Only three isolates were found that also had the H antigen H7. They had been part of a batch of 39 isolates from calves with colibacillosis in Argentina. These three isolates were from the faeces of one of three animals from one farm and were the only verotoxigenic isolates among the 39. They were also biochemically similar to the 0157.H7 strains, which had been isolated from a number of the outbreaks. The authors suggest that cattle may be the reservoir of these organisms. In a study on the development of diarrhoea among special-fed calves' in USA, VTEC played only a small role as causes of diarrhoea, although they were isolated from a few cases (McDonough et a1 1994) . Cryptosporidia, coronavirus and rotavirus were much more important.",

            "text": "Infection with Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can also lead to HUS. Neutralisation studies have shown that one of the serological types of VT is antigenically related to Shiga toxin (O'Brien et a1 1982; Scotland et a1 1985) . For this reason some authors call this group Shiga-like toxins (SLT). The VT, which is neutralised by antibody to Shiga toxin, has been termed SLT I (or VTl) and the antigenically distinct cytotoxin, which has the same biological effect on Vero cells, was called SLT I1 (VT2). Both terms have equal validity. Some isolates produce only one cytotoxin, while others produce both (Scotland et a1 1985) . It has been demonstrated further that the production of these SLTs is mediated by phage. Specific DNA probes have been used in DNA hybridisation studies to identify the toxin-specific DNA sequences. Under stringent conditions (Willshaw et a1 1985) , no cross-hybridisation could be detected between SLT I and SLT 11. The early studies on these toxins have been reviewed (O'Brien and Holmes 1987) . March and Ratnam (1986) demonstrated that strains of EHEC belonging to serotype 0 157.H7 generally did not ferment sorbitol. They developed a MacConkey medium, in which sorbitol replaces lactose. Use of the sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) agar has led to a great advance in the ability of laboratories to culture for these organisms and easily identify EHEC of serogroup 0157. It has unfortunately led to the misconception that only non-sorbitol fermenting E coli 0157 are EHEC and many other EHEC Strains have been ignored. Many had forgotten that some other E coli also do not ferment sorbitol. As long ago as 1952 a SMAC agar was described for the isolation of EPEC of 0 groups 01 11 and 0 2 6 (Rappaport and Henig 1952). which were rare in not fermenting sorbitol. The EHEC belonging to these 0 groups now being isolated do ferment sorbitol and the SMAC agar will not identify them. In addition not all sorbitol non-fermenting strains of E coli 0157 are EHEC (Pearce et a1 1994) .",

Thirty-two children (86%) had E coli 0157.H7 confirmed by faecal cuture and 33 (89%) had eaten at one of the restaurants of the implicated hamburger chain. Of the remaining four children, who had no contact with the chain, two had known contact with an infected patient. The age range of the patients was 1 to 15 years with a median age of 5 years. Gastrointestinal involvement, especially haemorrhagic colitis, was the main primary symptom. Both renal and haematological symptoms were evident on first presentation. Over half the children showed extrarenal abnormalities. Five patients required partial or complete colectomy and two of these subsequently died. A third child died on the way to the hospital after a seizure and cardiorespiratory arrest. Pancreatitis developed in eight patients with glucose intolerance developing in three of them. Twenty-six patients had oliguriafanuria and 21 of them required dialysis. A significant number of children developed cardiovascular complications (1 3), pulmonary complications (9) and/or neurological complications (6). Red blood cell transfusion was required by 28 and platelet transfusion by 20 children. The authors concluded their study by emphasising the effects that contaminated food can have on society and the need for appropriate public health measures.",

Also examined were isolates from sporadic cases throughout USA before the outbreak, hamburger meat both related to the outbreak as well as unrelated to it and from cattle not associated with the outbreak (Barrett et a1 1994) . All these 233 isolates were examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (BBhm and Karch 1992) and phage typed by the extended scheme of Khakhria et a1 (1992) . All the 26 isolates from patients associated with the multistate outbreak and all 27 isolates from incriminated lots of hamburger meat had the same electrophoretic pattern and belonged to the same phage type 14. Of the sporadic isolates obtained during the outbreak, a variety of phage and electrophoretic types were found. The only isolate in this group of phage type 14 differed in its electrophoretic pattern from the outbreak isolates. After the outbreak, however, two of nine patients yielded isolates of the same electrophoretic pattern as those incriminated in the outbreak strains and of phage type 14. From the other groups of isolates there were 35 with phage type 14, which represented the most common phage type found. Only one isolate also had the same electrophoretic pattern as those incriminated in the outbreak, but this was of a different phage type. This study demonstrates that even among isolates of E coli 0157.H7 there is a great diversity. While this permits epidemiological tracing of outbreaks, the question of possible differences in pathogenicity between differing types arises.",

A study of 11 3 1 dairy cows and 659 calves in Ontario, Canada (Wilson et a1 1992) specifically looked for SLT-producing E coli. The infection rate in cows was as high as 60% and in calves as high as 100% in some farms. The total prevalence for cows and calves was 9.5% and 24.7%, respectively. None of the 206 VTEC belonged to serotype 0157.H7. In the State of Washington, USA, an extensive survey of faecal carriage of E coli 0157.H7 in 3570 dairy cattle from 60 herds found that ten cows carried these organisms. These cows came from five of the herds representing a herd carriage rate of around 8% (Hancock etal 1994) . Similarly ten of 1412 pastured beef cattle were found to carry these strains. This represented four of 25 herds (16%). A study by Dorn et a1 (1993) on isolates of VTEC isolated cattle including cases of diarrhoea in calves between 1983 and 1989 in USA, failed to find any isolates of serogroup 0157. Most of the VTEC isolated belonged to serogroup 01 1 1. Others found included representatives of serogroups 05,026,045,069 and 0103. Of the 36 calves that yielded these VTEC, 12 had bloody diarrhoea and seven of them carried 0 1 11 .H-. All the isolates readily fermented sorbitol and most produced only SLT I. A number of the serotypes found in this study have been reported in earlier studies associated with human disease including 05.H-, 026.H11, 045.H2 and 01 1 1 .H-. The role of these VTEC as well as their relation with strains of 0157 within the bovine intestinal tract of cattle still has to resolved. Frank et a1 (1994) report the consistant colonisation of tonsils of healthy cattle by E coli. The only two SLT-producing strains, which were among the 124 isolates from 87 calves, produced SLT I and did not belong to serogroup 0157. They were not further characterised. It is suggested that the tonsils may be an important source of VTEC for human infection.",

A recent development of a sandwich ELISA, based on the use of monoclonal antibodies (Ball etal 1994) , may provide the means of directly testing for the presence of VTEC in cattle and other animal faeces. This study, which was performed in Northern Ireland, revealed that of the 304 samples from enteritis cases, 74 (24%) were positive and of the 113 samples from healthy animals, 35 (31%) were positive for VTEC. This again emphasises the widespread nature of these E coli in the domestic animal population. It also confirms the lack of correlation of VTEC carriage with enteritis in cattle. A number of similar studies have raised the question about the characteristics that cause some E coli to be human pathogens. It appears that toxigenic strains of E coli 0157 as well as many other serotypes occur in domestic animals, particularly cattle, but only a very limited number of serotypes is associated with human infection. A recent outbreak of diarrhoea due to strains of 01 57.H7 among Inuit people in the Northwest Territories of Canada (Orr et a1 1994) might have been associated with eating caribou meat, suggesting the possibility that these animals are also carriers of these E coli.",
