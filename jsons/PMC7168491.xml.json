Both kits detected approximately 10\u22123 fold diluted CVS\u201011 (4.0 \u00d7 103 FFU = 101.28 TCID50/50\u03bcl). For practical use, brain homogenate material will be used for test samples. Therefore, the utility of ICT was determined using rabid\u2010brain samples. Ten percent brain homogenate obtained from suckling mouse brain infected with strain 1088 was used and the infectious titer of this material was 1.0 \u00d7 107 FFU/ml (= 104.23 TCID50/50 \u03bcl). Type 1 and type 2 could detect up to maximal 3000 times dilution of the original material (approximately 3.3 \u00d7 102 FFU = 100.75 TCID50/50 \u03bcl). Therefore, ICT showed a higher ability to detect RABV in brain homogenate than in culture supernatant. The detection limit of RT\u2010PCR was 10\u22120.77 TCID50/50 \u03bcl which is approximately 30\u2010fold more sensitive than the ICT kit.",

FAT is approved by both WHO and OIE as the \u201cgold standard\u201d and available in several developing countries. FAT is a simple and reliable technique. Nevertheless, it requires expensive infrastructure and well\u2010trained technicians, especially for postmortem diagnosis of rabid animals in endemic countries. More advanced techniques such as RT\u2010PCR and NASBA have been successfully developed to detect RABV and approved for higher sensitivity. These are an alternative rapid way to confirm the diagnosis of rabies; however both methods need further skills and incur additional costs. More recently, a latex agglutination test (24) and direct rapid immunohistochemical test (25) have also been developed and evaluated using rabid samples. However these techniques are not yet widely accepted as an on\u2010site diagnostic method in the areas of Asia and Africa where the virus is endemic. Since alternative detection systems for RABV such as RT\u2010PCR and NASBA are based on the principal of gene amplification, they require several hours to obtain final results. Moreover, specific reagents and instruments are needed. PCR techniques are globally available for the diagnosis of various diseases; however socio\u2010economical reasons limit the availability of these laboratory diagnostic methods in most rabies\u2010endemic countries.",

The cost and need for well trained personnel are obstacles to the availability of FAT laboratories in such areas. Therefore a rapid, accurate and low\u2010cost means of laboratory diagnosis is both necessary and desirable in order to make an on\u2010site diagnosis of suspected cases, especially for intra vitam diagnosis of rabid animals. The rabies infection status of suspected animals is crucial for a rapid decision on PET, which should be started as soon as possible in any rabies exposed cases, but preferably only on the basis of a definite diagnosis, as the supply of rabies tissue culture vaccine is limited.",

Interestingly, the test was capable of detecting N protein without any treatments, although N protein is an internal protein of the virion. Why is the internally located N protein detected by the test? One possibility is that the MAb used in the ICT might recognize N protein which has leaked from the destroyed virion or infected tissue. Electron microscopic observation revealed that RABV particles contain several damaged virions and/or virions with protruding N protein (data not shown). Leakage of N protein from damaged RABV\u2010infected brain tissue might be detected by the ICT. Therefore, detergent in B buffer possibly exposes N protein in the infected tissue in addition to reducing the incidence of non\u2010specific reactions.",

False negative results could occur due to the sequence of viral infection and distribution in the early stages of infection. For detection of rabies, selection of the brain region from which to obtain samples is important. The brain stem and hippocampus provide best results. Similar to FAT, any doubtful or negative results need to be confirmed by animal history or other laboratory techniques, such as RT\u2010PCR, NASBA, cell culture or mouse inoculation tests depending on the facilities available in the local laboratory.",
