However, there remains a strong tendency for public health practitioners and traditional epidemiologists to continue to concentrate on the influence of \u201crisk factors\u201d related to living and working conditions of individuals, rather than to more systematically address the social dynamics that affect population health. This persistence has triggered critical reaction from voices not only in the Global North (e.g. [2-4]) but especially in the Global South [5-7] where there has been a long history of examining the social processes impeding healthy living (buen vivir) [8-12]. In this article, we discuss how adopting a language that focuses more directly on the social processes underlying health inequities can prompt a different approach to research and related policy and praxis. We see this discursive change in line with Bourdieu\u2019s recognition of the \u201csymbolic power\u201d associated with how science is invoked at any given time as an expression of social and political relations [13]. By focusing on how a language that has been developed more extensively in the Global South can inform empirical research in global health, we seek to extend the \u201creverse innovation\u201d debate that has been raised in the Globalization and Health journal.",

In this regard, Solar and Irwin [15], clearly distinguish between what are termed \"structural determinants\u201d and \u201cintermediary determinants\u201d in their conceptual framework for action on the social determinants of health, published as a World Health Organization (WHO) discussion paper:The central role of power in the understanding of social pathways and mechanisms means that tackling the social determinants of health inequities is a political process that engages both the agency of disadvantaged communities and the responsibility of the state. Second, it is important to clarify the conceptual and practical distinction between the social causes of health and the social factors determining the distribution of these causes between more and less advantaged groups. The CSDH [Commission on Social Determinants of Health] framework makes a point of making clear this distinction. On this second point of clarification, conflating the social determinants of health and the social processes that shape these determinants\u2019 unequal distribution can seriously mislead policy. \u2026.. The vocabulary of \u201cstructural determinants\u201d and \u201cintermediary determinants\u201d underscores the causal priority of the structural factors (pp.5-6).",

Joining colleagues from the Global North who also call for more comprehensively concentrating on systemic power relations (e.g. [2-4]), researchers from the Global South have been arguing for shifting our attention to social processes (e.g. [16]), and indeed shifting our language from \u201csocial determinants\u201d to the processes of the \u201csocial determination\u201d of health [SDnH] ([17-20]).",

The emergence in Latin America of a different conceptualization of \u201chealth equity\u201d has scarcely taken place in a vacuum. After all, in an increasingly globalized world marked by growing power asymmetries, the tendency in mainstream thinking to uncritically apply conceptual and epistemological framings dominant in \u201cNorthern\u201d settings has undervalued understandings that have emerged in the Global South [21,25]. This has been well recognized by the editors of Globalization and Health in their explicit call for learning from the South [26]. Crisp [27], noting that \u201cthere is still relatively little reverse flow of ideas and approaches from lower to higher income institutions\u201d (p.2), echoes the arguments of Barrios Suarez et al. [28] lamenting the typical North to South direction of global health knowledge rather than a truly reciprocal bi-directional flow. This Debate article similarly argues that \u201ctalking from the South\u201d not only implies focus on problems experienced in this locale, but also calls for building on the strengths of the theoretical-methodological reasoning that has emerged in the South.",

This is accompanied by a brief discussion of the nature of the \u201chealth equity/social determinants of health\u201d dominant framing and the parallel work that has been taking place on the \u201csocial determination\u201d of health conceptualization, briefly comparing and contrasting the two. Here we point to why language that re-focuses on the social processes (or SDnH) is more likely to lead to insights and actions that contribute to sustainable health equity. Such critical social theory considerations are especially pertinent in South-north global health research collaborations where teams are working together in participatory action research and other participatory empirical studies. As such, our Ecuadorian-Canadian partnership [29] provides an excellent opportunity to contribute to this analysis. In this context we introduce our long-standing (now decade long) international collaborative research program that currently addresses five quite distinct population health problems and settings, (health of healthcare workers; food systems; antibiotic resistance; vector borne disease [dengue]; and social circus with street youth), illustrating our attempts to apply the rich social theory from Latin America into the empirically rich participatory research we are conducting in diverse contexts. We conclude by reflecting on the broad epistemological and empirical challenges as well as opportunities that are presented in pursuing North-south collaborations.",

Despite the origins of public health being thoroughly rooted in profound appreciations of social and political contexts (Virchow, Engels) as described by Birn for example [4], the insights provided by breakthroughs in biological and medical sciences led by the emergence of germ theory in the late 19th century set the stage for new approaches. Importantly, while the evolution of epidemiological study prompted the development of increasingly sophisticated and powerful statistical and design techniques for measuring associations of exposure and disease, such \u201csuccess\u201d served to marginalize more theoretically-rich interdisciplinary - let alone transdisciplinary and intercultural - approaches to understanding the determination of disease in populations. Recognizing the challenges that tended to have been relatively ignored by mainstream \u201crisk factor\u201d epidemiology, new orientations and scientific paradigms related to social epidemiology and population health began to emerge in the Global North in the latter half of the twentieth century, cognizant of the intensifications of complexity-rooted effects and disparities that were being generated by ever intensified social changes (e.g. see the work of Krieger [31,32]).",

            "text": "Meanwhile alternative framings for more explicitly putting social justice and associated action at the core of the scientific endeavour were emerging in precisely the settings where marginalization and disparity were more intense. Specifically, in Latin America over the course of the Twentieth Century, the visible signs of extreme social and political authoritarianism and inequity, as well as the growing unfairness of the world economy, inspired a culture of social critique - and a corresponding academic reform movement related to health research began to be entrenched in major public universities in Latin America. It was no coincidence that this tendency paralleled the innovative orientation to learning prompted by Paolo Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed in response to formalistic approaches to learning and in search of social justice [33]. Such circumstances nurtured a profound social awareness among health scientists whose academic or public health roles placed them in direct contact with the devastating effects of poverty. This is the controversial trajectory under which epidemiology developed in Latin America since the late 1970s, transforming from a basic knowledge formation built around certain processes to a discipline constructed around partially defined objects, to finally becoming a science structured around clearly defined objects of study [34]. As various North American scholars noted, however, \u201ctwo of the most significant developments in health scholarship and practice of our era - the social medicine and critical epidemiology movements in Latin America\u201d [35], were remaining largely unknown in the North. In fact, there has been limited direct interchange between the scholarship in the South and the more counter-hegemonic expressions of epidemiology in the Global North [22]. As such, the timing remains overripe for pursuing active collaborations, such as the partnership in which we are engaged, as discussed below.",

In this way, attention is directly drawn not only to systematically consider the health effects associated with \u201cdeterminants\u201d, but also to consider the processes whereby those who are affected also respond to these circumstances, within and across scales. In this sense, those affected are considered as subjects whose agency is directly part of the theoretical conceptualization. In contrast, using the language of SDH and conventional epidemiology, interventions can focus on identified risk factors. The agency of those affected by these determinants tends to be relatively secondary in such analyses, and added as a caveat to consider, as per Solar and Irwin\u2019s cautions [15], rather than as central to the conceptual design of the relationships under consideration.",

In common with the many other critics mentioned above, our conceptualization of the social determination approach sees these considerations as necessary but not sufficient to dynamically consider driving influences as well as how affected social actors can engage with the normative position of pursuing social justice and health equity. In other words, as illustrated by Figure 1, our SDnH approach more directly promotes consideration of iii) processes that may be supportive of \u201cemancipation\u201d and health equity (potentially challenging hegemonic status quo social relations); and iv) the forces that drive and influence relationships and determinants themselves, over and above a role in \u201cdetermining the distribution of these causes between more and less advantaged groups\u201d as per the SDH conceptual framing [15].",

We must not allow the concept of social determinants of health to become banal, co-opted or reduced merely to smoking, sedentary behavior and poor nutrition, when what we need is to recognize that behind those symptoms and effects lies a social construction based on the logic of a globalized hegemonic culture whose ultimate goal is the commercialization of life itself [37].",

The specific lenses applied to ascertain how a policy or intervention in response to underlying conditions is likely to promote health (Modos de vivir saludables) are expressed as \u201c4 S\u2019s\u201d: Sustainability, Sovereignty and Solidarity and bio-Security [39], providing in and of itself a more nuanced focus on what is needed to achieve what many in the Global North refer to as \u201chealth equity\u201d as an outcome. Assessment of whether mezzo-level modes of living are healthy or unhealthy can accordingly be considered not only by deciphering positive and negative associations linking \u201chealth outcome\u201d and determinant indicators \u2013 but to directly consider interactions with the 4 S process-related dimensions, again keeping in mind that the relationships are dynamic and not static. This includes consideration of how social actors retain their capacities to resist hegemonic systemic forces (Sovereignty) that may undermine the integrity of their health as well as the capacity to effectively orchestrate a collaborative organic (Solidarity) response in line with their social character. It also recognizes that certain systemic forces that deviate from more organic self-regulating processes can imperil life-supporting systems (Sustainability) \u2013 to negatively affect health security (Bio-Security) through resulting imbalances as well as the introduction of threats associated with newly introduced technologies.",

Less attention has been devoted by social theorists - critical epidemiologists in the South to empirical studies addressing health challenges in specific populations or settings than has been the case in the emerging research in health disparities now developing in North American and European settings [41]. There is thus a challenge to clearly articulate where the alternative orientations lead, in both their processes and outcomes. It is from this perspective that we wish to explore how a SDnH approach can be applied, and to consider the challenges as well as the insights that this can generate. As such, we reflect on our collaborative research program being conducted with the objective of merging the theoretical richness of social determination scholarship with practical empirical approaches acquired through empirical health science scholarship developed more strongly in the Global North.",

Associated with this was deterioration in the conditions of human health resources, a neglected health system component that received growing attention with its selection as the theme of the 2006 World Health Report [44]. In Canada, co-author AY had championed a research program focusing on the health of health workers [45-47], so was well positioned to engage in this issue. Following the outbreak of SARS in 2002, this research focused more intensively on bringing together infection control with occupational health [48]. This joint occupational health-infection control team worked together not only in Canada but also in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) [49-51]; and in 2007 worked with colleagues in Ecuador to develop guidance documents and launch capacity building workplace initiatives [52]. A specific area of health concern for health workers globally, and especially in LMICs with a relatively high prevalence and incidence rate of tuberculosis (TB) in the general population, particularly given the increased risk of multiple and extremely drug resistant TB (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) in such settings [53] was indeed the control of infectious disease transmission to healthcare workers. Co-author AY had led the development of new international guidelines for health workers that have been adopted by the WHO, International Labour Organization and UNAIDS [54], and headed a research program in this area (Promoting Health Equity by Addressing the Needs of Health Workers: A Collaborative, International Research Program) [49,50,55]. However, while the team recognized the negative impact of global economic forces on health of health workers and public health sector infrastructure [56-58] and built this into their research grant application, until the concerted effort was guided by an understanding of social determination of health, inadequate attention was paid in the operationalizing of these various North-south collaborative action research projects to the social processes driving inadequacies in these areas. As the Ecuadorian government sought to strengthen the public health system in response to years of neglect, the opportunity for improving working conditions emerged as an area to be addressed by the Canadian-Ecuadorian collaboration, and a decision was made to explicitly attempt to put the theoretical richness of an SDnH approach of health into practice.",

In the context of this background, our research program is focusing on strengthening occupational health and infection control while building capacity to address the problematic nature of work organization and work relations in this setting. Focusing not merely on identifying risks in the work environment, developing policies and procedures to address these, and training health workers to properly implement these measures, the SDnH approach adopted focuses more directly on contextualizing the work setting and hospital management dynamics within an understanding of global and national economic and political forces. Moreover, the research activity reflects the principles of participatory action research [59,60]. Thus the project revolved around working with health workers to develop their own abilities to identify unhealthy working conditions. The SDnH approach examines individual circumstances (micro domain) but framed within an understanding of the conditions associated with the group to which the participants belong (mezzo domain), and projects these understandings towards promoting changes within institutions and social organizations influencing these domains (macro level). The resulting integrated framework has been guiding us in devising policies and procedures that take into consideration work organization and social hierarchies, directly considering preventive approaches that could be taken up in advocacy for promoting greater health equity. We are currently in the process of implementing research in Ecuador that embraces this latter approach, incorporating the technical expertise acquired by our team in Canada [61,62], South Africa [50,55] and beyond [51], with the extensive existing expertise in Ecuador in occupational health and infection control. Building \u201cagency\u201d through facilitating the creating and strengthening of grassroots networks is a key aspect of the strategy being adopted. Importantly, attention to the 4 S\u2019s has been guiding the conceptualization and research process, as shown in Table 1.",

As a result, this area was identified as a priority domain for our team\u2019s attention, especially in light of the prominent attention to food sovereignty in the 2007\u201308 process of adopting a new constitution in Ecuador. We therefore linked this focus with food system and health concerns being experienced in Canada to provide an opportunity to explore interconnections in a global food system. To better understand ways to promote health equity and healthy living in response to dominant processes associated with producing, distributing and consuming food globally, we assembled Canadian and Ecuadorian teams of researchers and knowledge users to stimulate thinking about strategies for advancing research on global, national and local scales when faced with complexity, through a five-year research program co-led by co-authors JS and JB (Food systems and health equity in an era of globalization: Think, Eat and Grow Green Globally [TEG3]) [63].",

The different epistemological traditions in fact led to different conceptual frameworks for initiating this exercise in each setting, prompting us to critically reflect on the significance of the conceptual framings we were applying. The English-language review [64] was initiated with reference to identifying distinct pathways (or constellations of determinants) that influence health equity and suggest areas for intervention, while the Spanish language review was organized with reference to relationships to the 4 S\u2019s with more direct focus on processes that affect healthy living. In both orientations, social class influences on nutritious food access were observed to be of particular importance. Sustainability concerns related to climate change and multiple food contaminants (framed as \u201cbio-security\u201d in Spanish) such as agro-toxins (commonly referred to as pesticides in English), animal antibiotic use or genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) were also flagged by knowledge users in both settings as requiring more attention.

This entails systematic identification of pathways, estimation of effect and evaluation of impact prompted by consideration of 4 S concerns.

A risk-factor-oriented SDH approach typically restricts its focus more narrowly. In contrast, in pursuing an SDnH approach, as shown in Table 2, we are linking access to food to meet the nutritional requirements of marginalized populations with concerns about agrochemical contamination in a direct attempt to build solidarity for actions to achieve sustainable and bio-secure food sovereignty. For example, while pesticide use in the Global South may help reduce the cost of buying bananas by residents of inner city communities in the Global North, this would not be in keeping with the 4S\u2019s in that such achievements would be realized by exposing workers and communities to increased toxic exposures. The SDnH approach thus calls for the building of solidarity between North and South to recognize the lack of sustainability of this approach, questioning implications of capital accumulation by large multinational food corporations.",

From this traditional epidemiological perspective, we tend to believe that the \u201cgold standard\u201d for measuring success in the area of antibiotic resistance is either reduced morbidity/mortality related to drug-resistant bacterial infections, or detection of less resistance and fewer resistant strains in routine microbiological testing, or reduced use of 2nd and 3rd line antibiotics. What we found was that not only were the surveillance systems not in place to collect the needed data to evaluate the effectiveness of our interventions, but that these measures fail to capture concepts such as good living or Sumak Kawsay (in Kichwa), that come from the wisdom of an Indigenous worldview. Within the latter epistemology, success is defined by perceived healthy and sustainable relationships between living organisms, with a focus on process, mutual respect, and reverence for the autonomy of others \u2013 processes that address the root of the structural problem, locally, nationally and internationally.",

We collected data on antibiotic use from 2008\u20132011, and worked with communities to develop some possible interventions at the level of the pharmacy dispensary, physician practices, families, community health promoters, and government programs; we strengthened relationship with experts on antibiotic use in animals; and we collaborated with another organization in Ecuador, ReAct, promoting their arts-based methods to improving antibiotic stewardship [74].

In contrast, the SDnH approach we decided to adopt in our Ecuador work, while providing the necessary information found in the \u201cDo bugs need drugs?\u201d Canadian manual, also explicitly focuses on raising awareness of the reasons for the emergence (or social production) of antimicrobial resistance, and embraces an intercultural approach to health \u2013 promoting living in harmony with nature and all the organisms of the ecosystem, as well as encouraging community mobilization to demand that basic needs are met. As such, the intercultural booklet embracing an ecosystem approach to antimicrobial resistance that we produced working collaboratively with indigenous communities, government departments, the Pan American Health Organization, and university partners in Ecuador, while providing practical advice, does not shirk from identifying the social processes that perpetuate the transmission of infectious diseases and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Although we had intended to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the use of the booklet by Community Health Promoters within a cluster-randomized trial in communities across Ecuador, the contextual reality precluded proper implementation. Some of the challenges related to changes in personnel within the Ministry of Health, as well as the realization that the surveillance systems did not exist for capturing data on antimicrobial use, let alone on trends in resistance, leaving us with only process measures (as well as knowledge, attitudes and self-reported practice) to serve as outcome to measure quantitatively. We therefore set out to build the infrastructural capacity, while promoting the use of the material, leaving rigorous evaluation to a future date. Traditional epidemiology would consider this study a failure; however, the research process itself brought together communities, non-governmental organizations, national government and international agencies, serving to raise the level of awareness and conferring some empowerment to serve as a basis for future challenges to detrimental social processes.

Analysis comparing the application of these indices with observations using the impressionistic social class designations of other studies revealed a significantly greater validity of INSOC in providing an evidence-based means for examining the social ecology (stratified as \u201chigh\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201clow\u201d [77]). For example, distinct social gradient relationships by INSOC social class designations (in contrast to impressionistic categorization) were observed with regard to housing quality and the type of water containers at greatest risk for dengue infestation. We are now proceeding to extend this analysis more broadly to 2011 Ecuador census data which provides sufficient data to construct INSOC variables. Using this, we will then delineate the kinds of interventions that can benefit from this more sensitive approach to social characterization, noting the limits that behaviour adaptation interventions can offer in comparison to the pursuit of broader structural and infrastructural transformations.",

Building on the earlier work of performance studies theorist Jennifer Spiegel [79,80], a 3-year grant from CIHR was obtained to apply mixed research methods to improve understanding of the micro (individual), mezzo (community) and macro (social system) impacts of the extensive social circus programs now underway in marginalized communities in Ecuador.",

Social circus can be seen as part of the increasing interest in art-for-social-change, wherein arts-based practices have indeed been transformative, as noted by artists and educators like Brecht [85], Freire [86] and Boal [87]. Canada has cutting-edge practitioners in the use of performing arts, such as theatre and dance to address social determinants [88] and promoting community health [88]. As Fraser and al Sayah concluded, however, rarely do studies identify theoretical underpinnings of the research [89] and even more rarely do studies take a critical perspective to confront issues of power.",

This question began to be posed by our team when Cirque du Soleil began in 2011 to implement a government-sponsored social circus program to promote healthy social policy. Ecuador\u2019s Vice President, with a particular interest in humour and the arts, made this one of his flagship initiatives in a national public program, reaching many thousands of participants. The program focuses on street youth, but also includes programs for children from marginalized populations. We therefore decided to explore how social circus can influence the social determination of health. In addition to participant observer methods, focus groups, interviews and questionnaire surveys, we are incorporating participatory arts-based methods (such as photovoice [91]) to engage the participants themselves in the research process not as subjects of the research but as active members of the research team. We are considering if roles are stereotyped and participation mitigated by sex and gender, for example; we will be considering the power differentials in social circus programs; and we will be developing a much-needed theoretical approach to understanding how the use of circus arts by marginalized populations can challenge the social processes perpetuating their marginalization [79], to the extent they chose to do so [92].",

Some programs in Latin America do have social transformation as an explicit goal [93,94]. While this goal is more muted in this government-funded program, the aim of the research is to improve understanding of how impacts at the micro, mezzo and macro levels interact and how social circus can contribute to transformative change.

            "text": "There are three common themes that characterize the seemingly diverse research initiatives that are presented above. First is the persistence of hegemonic neoliberal socio-political pressures that have driven disparity in Ecuador by promoting patterns of accumulation that disadvantage marginalized populations and undermine their resilience. Secondly, these same forces have stimulated the development of counter-hegemonic responses in all cases, and this is explicitly recognized and incorporated in the research. Thirdly, the focus of each of these research initiatives is not merely on addressing the proximal processes threatening health - i.e. the specific SDH in question (e.g. poor infection control in hospitals, lack of nutrition, misuse of antibiotics, vector-borne diseases, or alienation of marginalized youth), but rather the social processes that could be challenged in a manner that would empower communities (including workforces) to address underlying power relations. In this way, the SDnH approach we are endeavouring to apply in our work aims at the processes that drive social inequities, not merely the effects of these inequities, while at the same time directly considering the resistant (liberatory) forces capable of countering negative health impacts. Specifically:i)facilitating the empowerment of health workers to respond to deteriorating working conditions and to address the power differentials and work organization within healthcare as well as the detrimental state decision-making processes;ii)working with NGOs and producer groups to improve food equity, biosecurity in agro-ecological production, to mobilize in response to commodification trends and narrowing options driven by a neo-liberal food system;iii)strengthening the knowledge and skills within indigenous communities and NGOs to counter the development of anti-microbial resistance in response to inappropriate use of antibiotics driven by short-term profit-seeking behaviours, and to demand that basic needs are met;iv)working with a variety of partners in marginalized urban and peri-urban community settings to more effective and sustainable responses to threat of vector-borne disease amid conditions of socio environmental deterioration, entomological disruption and expansion of unhealthy health living patterns and exposure; andv)working with street youth and other marginalized groups who participate in social circus in order to facilitate building self-esteem, skills and social networks to strengthen their ability to strive for transformative change.",

            "text": "As explained by Breilh [78] \u201ccriteria for truth\u201d in the social determination model is the extent to which the research process can effect real social change. Indeed in many Northern schools of population health (including the home base of authors AY and JS), advanced skills in statistical techniques are required for a doctoral degree by all students regardless of their topic or preferred methods of research, while no such emphasis is placed on critical theory. Certainly medical students in the faculty in which AY and JS work are often completely unfamiliar with the social processes underlying poverty [56], while they learn that randomized controlled trials with sophisticated statistical techniques are the required standard of evidence for interventions to be deemed effective. Emphasis on such relatively narrow standards of proof has prompted Schrecker [97] to provocatively query \u201cCan health equity survive epidemiology?\u201d \u2013 and conclude that it is essential to consider and pursue broader approaches (methodological pluralism). In contrast, at the home base of Southern author JB, familiarity with emancipatory theory is a core requirement for doctoral studies in the collective health program, while statistical skills are only required of those who intend to use such techniques in their theses. Our collaborative research is attempting to apply both advanced epidemiological techniques as well as social theory. Our point, however, is that the language of social determinants (especially in its simplistic form, with limited differentiation made between immediate and structural determinants) lends itself to research that is more reductionist and hence beckons the development of different skills than would be applied by those who adopt the language of social determination.",

Embrett and Randall [98] suggest that a reason for this can be found in the failure to adequately integrate and apply a thorough understanding of policy analysis theory. While we strongly agree that attention to policy theory can contribute to more effective interventions, we argue that there is a more fundamental need to strengthen our grasp of the processes that drive health inequities and capacities for addressing them. Our experience illustrates that we do indeed need a sharper theoretical focus in guiding empirically-rich intervention research, but this theory must look not at discrete social determinants of health, but rather to comprehend and then address the critical processes of social determination that systemically drive disparities. This sharper focus is needed in order to promote the conceptualization and operationalizing of intervention research in a manner that could be more transformative.",

The failure to have adequately embraced insights emerging from all corners of the globe undermines the benefits that this can bring to world knowledge - and risks contributing to \u201cepistemicides\u201d that marginalize alternative forms of knowledge [101]. Prominent Brazilian epidemiologist Cesar Victora even conjectured that strategies to break the under-representation of such contributions from the \u201cSouth\u201d are themselves needed [102], in line with Raewyn Connell\u2019s observation that with few exceptions, \u201cmainstream social theory sees and speaks from the global North\u201d [103]. Notwithstanding the difficulties we encountered in operationalizing research in line with our social theory, we argue that there is much to gain from pursuing collaborations that concurrently promote the strengths of design and methodology that have been spawned by conventional epidemiology from the North with the epistemological and theoretical insights developed particularly from the Latin American collective health theorists.",
