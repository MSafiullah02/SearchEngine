As at the date of writing this article, the disease has been globally reported in 100 countries, infected over 100,000 people and caused over 3,000 deaths. Avoiding person-to-person transmission is an effective approach to control and prevent the epidemic. However, many daily activities, such as logistics transporting goods in our daily life, inevitably involve person-to-person contact. To achieve contact-less goods transportation, using an autonomous logistic vehicle has become the preferred choice. This article presents Hercules, an autonomous logistic vehicle used for contact-less goods transportation during the outbreak of COVID-19. The vehicle is designed with autonomous navigation capability. We provide details on the hardware and software, as well as the algorithms to achieve autonomous navigation including perception, planning and control. This paper is accompanied by a demonstration video and a dataset, which are available here 1 .",

Fig. 2(a) shows the * Equal Contribution 1 https://sites.google.com/view/contact-less-transportation sensors on the 3-D model of our vehicle. Fig. 2 (b) shows the top view of the modules in the chassis. The main modules of the chassis are those related to motion control: Motor Control Unit (MCU), Electric Power Steering (EPS), Electro-Hydraulic Brake (EHB) and Electronic Parking Brake (EPB). MCU supports both the speed-control and torque-control, with the input commands from the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU). EPS controls the vehicle steering. The combination of MCU and EPS controls the vehicle longitudinal and lateral motions. EHB controls the brake, and EPB controls the parking brake. The Body Control Module (BCM) controls various electronic accessories in the vehicle body, such as light and horn. VCU is the core of the DBW chassis, which is responsible for coordinating each module. It keeps communicating with the IPC, performing parameter checking and sending commands to other modules. In addition, VCU responds to critical safety signals, such as the stopping signal from the emergency button. There are some sensors in the chassis, such as a bumper, encoder and Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). The bumper and TPMS are both safety-critical sensors. Specifically, the bumper is used to avoid collisions. The encoder is a low-cost and effective sensor for odometry which measures the rotation of wheel precisely.",

We use multiple Lidars for object detection. To exploit the information from multiple Lidars, it is important to calibrate them. To this end, we propose a marker-based approach [1] for automatic calibration without any additional sensors and human intervention. We assume that three linearly independent planar surfaces forming a wall corner shape are provided as the calibration targets, ensuring that the geometric constraints are sufficient to calibrate each pair of Lidars. After matching the corresponding planar surfaces, our method can successfully recover the unknown extrinsic parameters with two steps: a closed-form solution for initialization based on the Kabsch algorithm [2] and a plane-to-plane iterative closest point (ICP) [3] for refinement.",

With the assumption that the Lidars are synchronized, we transform the raw point clouds captured by all the Lidars into the base frame, and then feed the fused point clouds into the 3-D object detector. The final output is a series of 3-D bounding boxes. Each bounding box b \u2208 B is parameterized as [c, x, y, z, w, l, h, \u03b3], where c is the class of a bounding box, and [x, y, z] denotes the bottom center of a box. We employ VoxelNet [4] as the 3D object detector, which consists of three main components: a Feature Learning Network (FLN) for feature extraction; Middle Layers (ML) for feature embedding with sparse convolution; and a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for box prediction and regression.

The moving objects are detected by subtracting the corresponding bounding boxes from the warped and current point-cloud frames. Specifically, we set a threshold for the distance between the bounding boxes. Moving objects are detected with distances above the threshold.

Fig. 7 shows the online local path planning for driving on standard roads. Here we plan the path in the Frenet coordinate system. With the global path as the reference path, it defines the lateral shift to the path and the distance travelled along the path from the start position. We drew multiple samples with different speeds and lateral offsets. Then a graph search method is adopted to search the path with the minimum cost.

Besides this, the local planning process is time-consuming and has a low update rate, which is inadequate to handle dynamic obstacles and emergency cases. The motion planner optimizes the trajectory given the information of obstacles, the constraints from the vehicle, and the path from the local path planner. It outputs the final trajectories for the controller to follow at a much higher updating rate to ensure safety. Fig. 8(b) shows the planned trajectory as yellow curves.

Sometimes, sensor feedback from the chassis cannot be directly sent to the controller, or more feedback quantities are required by the controller, which is difficult to obtain from sensors. In such cases, a state feedback estimator is required but is not a must. In Fig. 9 , the output of the trajectory tracking controller u(t) is sent to the chassis after being processed by a lower controller. The lower controller can work for many purposes. For example, our autonomous vehicle can work in both the autonomous-driving mode and the parallel-driving model (i.e., the remote control mode).

The goal of rolling optimization is to determine the final control quantities through the optimization of an objective function. Rolling optimization must be repeatedly carried out in real-time. Feedback information is used to correct the predictive results based on the car feedback information so as to process rolling optimization in the next period. The major difference between the kinematics-based MPC and dynamicsbased MPC is the simplified vehicle model. The vehicle kinematics model is totally geometry-based, which takes the vehicle as a two-wheeled bicycle model, namely the Ackerman model. It applies while the vehicle is operated at low speed. The dynamic-based MPC is much more accurate than the kinematic-based MPC, and is derived from force analysis.

When the vehicle operates at low speed, the kinematic constraints restrain the vehicle motion planning and control. But with the increment of speed, dynamic characteristics become more influential. As aforementioned, the dynamic-based MPC is much more accurate than the kinematic-based MPC since the predictive model is more accurate. However, we found that the complexmodel prediction is not the best option. With regards to low-and middle-speed operation environments, a simplified predictive model with multiple constraints would be sufficient. As is known, the introduction of multiple constraints in the optimization may narrow down the range of solutions and even lead to no solution, which may corrupt the program. In such a case, it would be wise to bring in the relaxing factor when designing the objective function that could avoid the nosolution situation. Another factor that needs to be considered carefully when applying the MPC is the determination of the prediction horizon. A long prediction horizon can improve the control accuracy to a certain degree, but would consume more computation power and reduce the real-time performance. Different controlled plants in different operation environments may have different requirements on the control frequency. With the guarantee of the control frequency, our strategy is to select a prediction horizon that is as long as possible.",
