There was an exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the current pandemic with ~ 15% of infected patients requiring intensive care 2 . As many hospitals would be dealing with patients that are either SARS-CoV-2 positive, suspected or under surveillance, a comprehensive protocol is imperative if they require surgical intervention.",

We appreciate that the authors have dealt with several patients requiring tracheostomy and reported one case as an example. However, we believe the report lacks some important information that will surely strengthen and improve processes and effective management of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy.",

            "text": "It would be interesting to know if the decision to perform tracheostomy was made when the patient was seronegative or seropositive for COVID-19. Also, it would be helpful to know if a repeat PCR test, chest radiograph, or chest CT scan were performed to assess the progress of the disease. The British and Canadian guidelines recommend that elective procedures should be avoided in patients who are PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 or have an active infection because of chances of spreading the infection 3, 4 . During the course of treatment, if the patient has become PCR negative, is there still a need for taking lengthy and elaborate precautions? However, if the patient was COVID-19 positive, what were the reasons to delay open tracheostomy until the 39th day? A recent study showed that mortality was 80% in COVID-19 positive patients who had survived beyond 28 days on mechanical ventilation with tracheal intubation 5 . Tracheostomy is considered a high-risk procedure and chances of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to providers is high [3] [4] [5] . An early tracheostomy is considered beneficial for pulmonary secretion clearance, reduced risk of subglottic stenosis, reduced sedation and early weaning from mechanical ventialtion 6 .",
