They found that a cortisol total/CRP ratio > 3 upon admission may predict the development of HAP in patients with severe TBI [1]. The study is interesting, while we have some concerns about the study design and interpretation of the data.",

Although the relatively small sample size is considered as a reason for negative findings, we believe that stratified analyses are more important for such a study. HAP is a form of nosocomial pneumonia, which is distinct from VAP [3]. In a published guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society, the term HAP denotes an episode of pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation [4, 5]. As acknowledged also by the authors, mechanical ventilation promotes a specific histological pattern of pneumonia [1]. Hence, patients with HAP and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be categorized into two distinct groups. All cases of recorded HAP were VAP [1], which means all these patients received mechanical ventilation. Thus, we are eager to know about the patients without HAP. What is the percentage of mechanical ventilation use in these patients?",

We are then interested to know about the prophylactic use of antibiotics in the CORTI-TC trial.",
