            "text": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of infancy in the United States with an incidence of over 30% in extremely preterm infants, resulting in 10,000\u201315,000 new cases annually in the United States [1]. Prenatal steroids, gentle ventilation techniques, as well as exogenous surfactant have increased survival rates in preterm infants and decreased the severity of lung injury [2]. Over the last two decades, while survival rates of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants has steadily improved, the number of patients with BPD has remained the same or even increased [3, 4]. BPD is associated with increased mortality, poor neurodevelopmental outcome, and long-term respiratory complications in survivors [4\u20136].",

            "text": "Among the cardiovascular sequelae, pulmonary hypertension (PH) contributes significantly to the high morbidity and mortality in BPD patients. Vascular remodeling, reduced alveolar\u2013capillary surface area, altered distribution of vessels, and abnormal vascular tone and reactivity result in an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) [7]. Increased PVR leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and subsequently right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and RV failure. There have been multiple retrospective and prospective studies which have recognized various risk factors for the development of PH in infants with BPD such as LBW, small for gestational age (SGA), duration of mechanical ventilation, use of high frequency ventilation, longer duration of antibiotics, surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus and severe BPD [8\u201312]. However some of these studies used a limited number of perinatal factors to seek association with the development of PH. There have been limited studies to find the factors associated with Early PH (EPH) and also the relationship of EPH with Late PH (LPH) and BPD [9, 13\u201315]. We conducted a retrospective case-control observational study on a fairly large sample size to investigate the association of multiple perinatal factors using standardized definitions for development of EPH and LPH using defined echocardiographic criteria in preterm infants with BPD. We used a comprehensive list of pre- and postnatal variables with the goal of a detailed analysis of all potential risk factors contributing to E/LPH. In addition, we investigated the relationship between EPH and LPH, with the aim of an earlier detection of BPD\u2013LPH for a potential future utility of an improved therapeutic approach to identify and manage BPD\u2013LPH to decrease morbidity/mortality in these infants.",

Antenatal diagnoses such as gestational diabetes, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia, preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), and chorioamnionitis were defined as per the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines [22\u201326]. Maternal diabetes included preexisting as well as gestational diabetes. Maternal antibiotics included any antibiotics given to the mother in the antenatal period except if given for presurgical prophylaxis. Tracheitis was defined as following: (1) absence of clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, AND (2) a positive culture obtained by deep tracheal aspirate or bronchoscopy, AND (3) \u22652 of the following signs or symptoms with no other recognized cause: temperature >38 or < 36 \u00b0C, new or increased sputum production, rhonchi, or wheezing, respiratory distress, apnea, or bradycardia (<100 bpm) [27, 28]. In our NICU, it is usual clinical practice to collect tracheal culture in the presence of any of above symptoms in the absence of pneumonia findings on chest x-ray. It is a routine clinical practice in our NICU to administer tapering doses of dexamethasone for 10 days as per the DART protocol for BPD patients requiring prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation [29]. Bacteremia was defined as any positive blood culture during the NICU stay for the patient. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was classified as per Papile et al., while periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) was defined as described by Banker et al. [30, 31]. IVH intervention included ventricular reservoir and/or ventriculoperitoneal shunt placements. Modified Bell\u2019s criteria were used to classify necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), while International Classification for Retinopathy of Prematurity was used to diagnose and classify retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) [32, 33].",

Normally distributed continuous variables were analyzed using independent sample t-test, while Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used for non-normal distributions. To determine the effect of all the prenatal and postnatal variables on the outcome of LPH and EPH, binomial logistic regression was used to arrive at odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Adjusted OR were determined by multiple logistic regression, to control for possible confounding effects of other variables. In the multivariate model, LPH (yes or no) and EPH (yes or no) were considered as the dependent variables separately, and all the prenatal and postnatal variables were analyzed as independent variables, which were adjusted for BW and sex as covariates. We also replaced BW with GA, with no major impact in our results. All data were analyzed with SPSS 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P values \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test was conducted to determine the model\u2019s goodness of fit.",

There have been a few studies, which have defined EPH as PH diagnosed within first week, 2 weeks or 4 weeks of life [8, 9, 13\u201315].

However, in contrast to previously described associations, we did not find a significant association with development of LPH with the use of antenatal steroids, IUGR, oligohydramnios, PPROM, modes of resuscitation used in delivery room, APGAR scores, surfactant use, surgical closure of PDA, or multiple gestation [9, 10, 35, 37\u201339].

To the best of our knowledge, such a relationship between maternal diabetes and LPH has not been previously reported. Maternal diabetes has been associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension in term newborn infants [40]. Recently, it has been proposed that BPD has its origins during fetal life and antenatal events including maternal placental under-perfusion are determining factors of the development of BPD [41\u201344]. Diabetes can result in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation [45], which might be associated with maternal under-perfusion and in turn be associated with BPD as well as LPH in these infants. As the screening test for gestational diabetes is done from 24 to 28 weeks of GA unless at high risk for diabetes, we might have missed some of the mothers who potentially would have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes later during pregnancy [22].",

These conditions might be associated with high risk of developing LPH due to the presence and persistence of inflammation in the airway and lung parenchyma, as well as due to severity of illness. Fourteen (82%) out of 17 patients who required tracheostomy were already diagnosed with LPH before placement of the tracheostomy tube. This might suggest these infants are at a high risk of having long-term ventilator dependency and so at risk of getting a tracheostomy.",

We attribute this skewness to the severity of illness of patients admitted to the level IV referral based NICU serving most of the underserved population of Philadelphia, PA. Cardiac catheterization has been accepted as the gold standard for diagnosing PH, however it is invasive and is not easily performed in premature neonates, and hence serial echocardiography is recommended as the main tool to screen for PH in BPD patients despite its limitations [46\u201348]. In our study, the diagnosis of E/LPH was made solely from echocardiography reports read by different pediatric cardiologists, which can cause inter-observer variability. A number of limitations of the BPD definition have been described; however, given its current universal practical value, we chose the NIH consensus definition for our study [49]. Another limitation of our study was that being a retrospective study, we could not control factors such as the consistent timing to get a CE. Despite these limitations, we report some important findings, which could potentially improve the earlier identification and management of premature patients with BPD. The other strengths of our study include the use of standardized definitions and a large sample size of our study cohort. Furthermore, the characteristics of our study population (racial distribution etc.) as well as the management of these infants remained reasonably consistent over the time period at our urban NICU.",

Based on these results, a risk-based scoring system, which would potentially include pre- and postnatal factors, can be formulated to screen for premature infants at risk for BPD and LPH. We propose to have at least one echocardiogram done to screen for PH < 28 DOL in premature neonates requiring respiratory support with FiO2 > 0.21, which can help strategize identification and management of BPD and LPH. Prospective studies are needed to validate this approach.",
