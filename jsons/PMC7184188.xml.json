            "text": "\nOn March 11th, 2020 the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) was declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organization. The unfolding crises illustrates the dramatic consequences that ensue when societies do not invest systematically in the basic social services required by all their members. When the interests of a few dominate over the needs of many. The outcome of COVID-19 depends on the ability of individuals, and of countries, to widen their perspective from me to us. Hopefully the paradigm shift that is presented in this book contributes to this change in dynamics.It should be noted here that \u2018Soul\u2019 in the context of the present methodology refers to the luminous core of every living being, which can serve as an anchor of our everyday existence. The term is used in its wider spiritual definition, without attachment to religion. It pertains to that which is intangible and yet indispensable, the essence that distinguishes objects from living beings. While the aim is to establish a common language, do bear in mind that terminology is only useful insofar as it serves as a vehicle to share an idea. Once you got the idea, you are free to forget whichever formulation has been used, and simply make it your own.\nMeta-systems will be used in this book to refer to systems that, due to their size, complexity, and extent, are not grasped by the traditional scope of macro-systems. In other words, \u2018 macro\u2019 refers to country-wide systems. \u2018 Meta\u2019 refers to the global interplay that connects individuals, communities, countries, culture and cosmos across the all dimensions.The syllable Om is first mentioned in the Upanishads, the mystical texts associated with the Vedanta philosophy. It has variously been associated with concepts of \u2018cosmic sound\u2019, \u2018mystical syllable\u2019, and \u2018affirmation to something divine\u2019 and acts as symbolism for abstract spiritual concepts. Over the past two millennia, it has been used in Eastern spirituality. The Brahmic script om-ligature has become widely recognized in Western culture since the 1960s. Refer to Wilke and Moebus\u2019s (2011). Sound and communication: a cultural history of Sanskrit Hinduism.\n",
