PHB1 was initially identified in 1989 by McClung and collaborators by screening for potential tumor suppressors with antiproliferative activities that were highly expressed in normal resting, but not regenerating, rat liver (McClung et al., 1989; Nuell et al., 1991). PHBs have since been shown to act as a hub for many signaling pathways triggered by growth factors, the immune response, and steroid hormones regulating metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, cell migration, division, and survival.",

            "text": "Located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, PHB1 and PHB2 interact with each other to form heterodimers that are organized in ring-like structures with a diameter of 20\u201325 nm (Figure 1\n; Back et al., 2002; Coates et al., 2001). These supercomplexes maintain the structure of mitochondria and regulate their functions (Tatsuta et al., 2005). PHBs protect newly imported proteins from degradation by the m-AAA (mitochondrial ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protease (Steglich et al., 1999), promote mitochondrial protein synthesis (He et al., 2012), maintain the organization and copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; Kasashima et al., 2008), and act as a chaperones for newly synthesized proteins of the mitochondrial complex I (Nijtmans et al., 2000, 2002) and the GTPase optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) during mitochondrial fission and morphogenesis (Merkwirth et al., 2008). PHB1 also interacts with the adaptor protein p66Shc, a major mediator of stress-induced apoptosis (Madireddi, 2006). This adaptor protein is activated by UVC, H2O2, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induces the generation of ROS in mitochondria, leading to apoptosis (Gertz et al., 2008). It remains unclear whether PHB1 modulates this proapoptotic response; nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that p66Shc is involved in the cytoprotective activities of PHBs and their ligands, particularly against oxidative stress (Bernard et al., 2011; Fahrig et al., 2005; Kathiria et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2009b; Ribeiro et al., 2012a).",

One of the best-documented examples is Akt phosphorylation of PHB1 at Thr258, which blocks its interaction with Shp1/2 and facilitates Akt signaling (Ande and Mishra, 2009). Shp1/2 is a phosphatase that facilitates Akt signaling and enhances insulin signaling. Additionally, the phosphorylation of PHB1 at Thr258 is necessary for the activation of C-Raf (Raf-1) by Ras (Chiu et al., 2013). Rajalingam et al. (2005) established that the activation of C-Raf by Ras requires the heterodimerization of phospho-PHB1(Thr258) with C-Raf. The phosphorylation of PHB1 at Thr258 in the plasma membrane of cancer cells activates PI3K/Akt and C-Raf/ERK pathways, which promote proliferation and metastasis (Chiu et al., 2012). By contrast, insulin-receptor-induced phosphorylation of PHB1 at Tyr114 promotes its heterodimerization with the phosphatase Shp1 and blocks Akt signaling (Ande et al., 2009a).",

In the early stage of tumorigenesis, TGF-\u03b2 acts as a tumor suppressor, but subsequently it promotes metastatic spread during cancer progression. The binding of TGF-\u03b2 to its receptor triggers the C-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and also activates Smad 2/3 or Smad 1/5, thereby causing opposite effects (Figure 2). ERK activates protein kinase C \u03b4 (PKC-\u03b4), which leads to the phosphorylation of PHB1 and consequently to cell survival and invasion. However, Smad signaling also upregulates 14-3-3 protein, which inhibits PKC-\u03b4, leading to a hypophosphorylation of PHB1 that promotes apoptosis.",

In platelets, PHB1 and PHB2 interact directly with protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) to promote platelet aggregation (Zhang et al., 2012). The physiological role of PHB1 at the surface of microglial cells and endothelial cells of adipose tissue remains elusive, but it has been demonstrated that PHB1 at the surface of cancer cells is involved in resistance to paclitaxel (Patel et al., 2010). A virulence antigen of Salmonella typhi, the causative agent of typhoid, interacts with PHB1 and PHB2 at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in downregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and inhibition of early inflammatory responses (Patel et al., 2010). Similarly, considerable proportions of total PHB1 and PHB2 are located on the surface of activated T cells, where they contribute to the activation of ERK induced by T cell activation (Yurugi et al., 2012).",

Indeed, PHB1 interacts with the transcription factor p53 in the nucleus of cancer cells to increase its transcriptional activity (Fusaro et al., 2003). p53 is a tumor suppressor that controls the cell cycle, apoptosis, genomic stability, and angiogenesis (Chander et al., 2010, 2011; Fusaro et al., 2003; Joshi et al., 2007). A component of ubiquitin ligase complexes, Skp2B, which is overexpressed in many breast cancers, interacts with both PHB1 and PHB2 to promote their degradation (Chander et al., 2010, 2011; Umanskaya et al., 2007). Because PHB1 acts as an activator (Fusaro et al., 2003) and chaperone (Chander et al., 2011) for p53, this depletion in PHB1 leads to an attenuated activity of p53 in cancer cells overexpressing Skp2B and consequently promotes their survival.",

A peptide corresponding to the nuclear export signal of PHB1 prevented the export of PHB1, resulting in the protection of cells from apoptosis, indicating that the translocation of PHB1 from the nucleus to the mitochondria contributes to its tumor-suppressive effects (Rastogi et al., 2006b). One mechanism by which the intracellular location of PHBs is controlled involves the signaling protein BIG3/WDR5, which traps PHB2 in the cytoplasm and consequently stimulates the estrogen-signaling pathway in the hormone-related growth of breast cancer cells (Kim et al., 2009).",

This dichotomy may reflect the heterogeneity of cancer cell types, which are manifested by an alteration of different signaling pathways. Consequently, the regulation of transcription, translation, and posttranslational modification of PHBs probably depends on the cancerous cell type involved. These posttranslational events (e.g., phosphorylation, SUMOylation, O-GlcNAc modification, palmitoylation, and transamidation) modulate both the subcellular localization of PHBs and their downstream effects on proliferation and survival of cells. On the cell surface PHB1 promotes chemoresistance, but on the inner face of the plasma membrane it can contribute to the oncogenic activation of C-Raf. However, it is tempting to speculate that in the nucleus PHB1 displays antitumorigenic activity due to its action on p53, Rb, p107, p130, and components of the mammalian replication machinery. Additional studies are required to decipher the roles played by signaling and intracellular localization of PHBs in oncogenesis.",

PHB1 is also upregulated in the liver of steatohepatitis patients (Tsutsumi et al., 2009), in fetal rabbit lung after exposure to hyperoxic conditions (Henschke et al., 2006), in pancreatic \u03b2-cells after ethanol intoxication, (Lee et al., 2010b), and in cardiac cells after ischemic-hypoxic preconditioning (Kim et al., 2006; Muraguchi et al., 2010) or chronic restraint stress (Liu et al., 2004). This cytoprotectant response involves the translocation of PHB1 from the nucleus and the cytoplasm to mitochondria in pancreatic \u03b2-cells (Lee et al., 2010b), in the retina and retinal epithelium (Lee et al., 2010a), and in ovarian granulosa cells (Chowdhury et al., 2007; Figure S2). Sripathi et al. (2011) suggested that the localization and trafficking of PHBs are determined by the modulation of their binding to specific lipids. Indeed, strong binding of PHB1 to cardiolipin was shown to correlate with the localization of PHB1 within mitochondria in transformed epithelial cells after an oxidative stress. By contrast, under normal conditions in these cells, PHB1 binds strongly to PIP3 but not to cardiolipin.",

            "text": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by strong oxidative stresses associated with downregulated antioxidant enzymes in the intestinal mucosa (Lih-Brody et al., 1996). Several studies in vitro and in vivo have indicated that PHB1 alleviates intestinal inflammation and promotes the survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress. In intestinal epithelial cells, PHB1 binds to a Salmonella typhi antigen to inhibit the inflammatory response to S. typhi infection (Sharma and Qadri, 2004). PHB1 expression is abnormally low during ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, the two most common forms of IBD (Hsieh et al., 2006; Theiss et al., 2007a; Yeo et al., 2006), due to an overstimulation of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) signaling in the inflamed colon (Theiss et al., 2009a). This downregulation of PHB1 increases ROS signaling and TNF-\u03b1-induced autophagy, promoting inflammation in patients with IBD (Kathiria et al., 2012a). Interestingly, transgenic mice overexpressing PHB1 in intestinal epithelial cells exhibit reduced proinflammatory nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling in the colonic mucosa after treatment with TNF-\u03b1, demonstrating that PHB1 plays a critical role in inflammation. A detailed examination of this mechanism of action revealed that PHB1 inhibits TNF-\u03b1-induced translocation of NF-\u03baB by downregulating the expression of importin \u03b13, a protein involved in NF-\u03baB nuclear import (Theiss et al., 2009a). In an in vivo model of IBD, PHB1 transgenic mice exhibited lower oxidative stress and colitis than wild-type mice (Theiss et al., 2009b). This cytoprotective effect is due to the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional activator of antioxidant responses. Further evidence that PHB1 is a putative therapeutic target for treating IBD comes from the observations that adenovirus-directed administration by enema and nanoparticle-based colonic delivery of PHB1 effectively enhanced the levels of PHB1 at the surface of colonic epithelial cells and alleviated colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (Theiss et al., 2011).",

At concentrations in the low-nanomolar range, flavaglines inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, are not toxic to normal cells (Hausott et al., 2004; Ribeiro et al., 2012a; Su et al., 2006; Thuaud et al., 2009, 2011; Zhu et al., 2007), and show no sign of toxicity in mice (Bernard et al., 2011; Cencic et al., 2009; Lee et al., 1998; Thuaud et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009). King et al. (1982) were the first to demonstrate the antileukemic activity of rocaglamide in a mouse model. Subsequently, Ohse et al. (1996) established that flavaglines strongly inhibit protein synthesis, and Lee et al. (1998) demonstrated that these compounds delay the growth of human breast cancer cells in athymic mice. However, because the tumors were not eradicated, these investigations were interrupted. Since then, with the development of targeted therapies, approaches to the development of cytostatic compounds have changed radically (Gutierrez et al., 2009). As a consequence, there is now a renewed interest in flavaglines as potential anticancer agents.",

The binding of flavaglines to PHBs inhibits Ras-C-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling, and such signaling is essential for the survival of cancer cells (Figure 3B). C-Raf needs to interact with PHBs to be phosphorylated by Ras and thus participate in signaling (Rajalingam et al., 2005). The binding of flavaglines to PHBs prevents this interaction both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of either PHB1 or PHB2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) mimicked the effects of flavaglines through inhibition of cap-dependent translation and an arrest of cell-cycle progression via a depletion of cyclin D3, CDK4, CDK6, and cdc25A. Moreover, rocaglamide strongly depleted PHB1 and phosphorylated C-Raf at the plasma membrane, suggesting that the relocation of PHBs to the membrane is involved in the mode of action of flavaglines. These various observations support the idea that flavaglines exert their anticancer effects through their action on PHBs.",

Bleumink et al. (2011) showed that this inhibition of C-Raf-ERK signaling blocks cap-dependent protein synthesis. Indeed, ERK activates Mnk1, which phosphorylates eIF4E, allowing cap-dependent synthesis to occur. Few proteins require phosphorylated eIF4E for their synthesis, and most of them are involved in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance. Thus, the in vivo anticancer effects of flavaglines seems to be a consequence of the inhibition of the synthesis of cyclins D1 and D3, CDK4, CDK6, cdc25A c-Myc, Bcl-2, survivin, Mcl-1, the PIM1/2 kinases, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) (Bordeleau et al., 2008; Cencic et al., 2009; Nasr et al., 2013; Polier et al., 2012; Schatz et al., 2011).",

Indeed, flavaglines at nanomolar concentrations act as immunosuppressors by inhibiting the production of interferon-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-4 by T lymphocytes (Proksch et al., 2005). This immunosuppression is mediated by activation of the MAPKs JNK and p38, which selectively inactivate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT; Figure 3C). It is still not known how flavaglines activate JNK and p38. At higher concentrations, flavaglines also inhibit NF-\u03baB, another transcription factor that is involved in inflammation (Baumann et al., 2002). Interestingly, the synthetic flavagline IMD-019064 inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling and displays potent in vitro anti-inflammatory effects that manifest as an inhibition of proinflammatory mediator release from astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells (Fahrig et al., 2005; Figure 3D). More importantly, IMD-019064 protects dopaminergic neurons both in vitro and in vivo in models of Parkinson\u2019s disease (MPP+-induced neurotoxicity) and traumatic brain injury. Recent SAR studies led to the identification of FL40, which provides greater neuroprotection in vitro than IMD-019064 (Ribeiro et al., 2012a). The neuroprotective activity of flavaglines is currently being actively explored by the pharmaceutical company Intermed Discovery, which has been developing IMD-026259 (Figure 3A) for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

Interestingly, these stresses are of different natures: doxorubicin causes an oxidative stress, whereas serum starvation blocks the growth factor signaling that is necessary for cell survival, mimicking an important component of myocardial ischemia. Treatment with FL3 significantly reduces mortality and attenuates both apoptosis and fibrosis in the hearts of doxorubicin-treated mice. Thus, flavaglines may both enhance the anticancer efficacy of anthracyclines and alleviate their main adverse effect, cardiotoxicity. Anthracyclines are central to cancer chemotherapies, so the discovery of a new class of cardioprotective agents would be extremely valuable clinically, and further studies to examine this therapeutic application are therefore warranted.",

It may seem odd than an anticancer drug can also display various cardio- or neuroprotective effects; however, there are precedents. For example, rapamycin derivatives (Erlich et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2006; Malagelada et al., 2010) and HDAC inhibitors are both cardio- and neuroprotectants in addition to having anticancer effects (Bush and McKinsey, 2009; Mai et al., 2009). A first clue to understanding this paradox may be that PHB1 is localized mainly in the mitochondria of normal cells and in the nucleus in cancer cells (Chen et al., 2011). The translocation of PHB1 from the nucleus and cytosol to mitochondria promotes survival in normal cells but apoptosis in cancer cells (Fusaro et al., 2003). It is therefore tempting to suggest that the opposite behaviors of flavaglines in cancer and normal cells are the consequences of different intracellular localizations of PHBs.",

By fusion with a proapoptotic sequence, they obtained adipotide (CKGGRAKDC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2), a chimeric peptide that damages the vasculature of the adipose tissue and consequently disrupts the blood supply to adipocytes. In obese mice, adipotide induced a substantial loss of weight and normalized metabolism, leading to a reversal of obesity without any adverse sign of toxicity. Surprisingly, food intake was reduced, suggesting that there is an unexpected relationship between the adipose tissue vasculature and the regulation of feeding behavior (Kim et al., 2010).",

(B) Melanogenin binds to PHB1 to induce the expression of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis. (C) Adipotide is a chimeric peptide that targets PHB1 at the surface of the vascular endothelial cells of white adipose tissue. Its proapoptotic sequence is responsible for the damage to this tissue. (D) Binding of capsaicin to PHB2 induces its translocation from mitochondria to the nucleus, a noncompetitive inhibition of the ANT2 and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, leading to the apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells. (E) Sulfonyl amidine (A) inhibits the osteoclastogenesis involved in bone remodeling. This compound binds to PHB1 and three other proteins. Which of these proteins is the relevant target involved in this antiresorptive activity remains unknown. (F) Aftin-4, which binds to PHB1, VDAC1, and mitofilin, promotes in neurons the production of the neurotoxic peptide A\u03b242, which is involved in the etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (G) The dihydrooxazole cHOxa alkylates PHB1, suggesting that it could be used as a chemical probe to analyze the structure of PHB1.",
