The expressed N protein inclusion body is extracted and purifi ed by chromatography on nickel-agarose column to near homogeneity. The protein recovery can be 10 mg from 100 ml of bacterial culture.

Prokaryotic expression is an economic and convenient system to prepare large amount of pure recombinant protein.

Cells are incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm in an incubator shaker overnight, to an OD of 600 nm approximately 0.5 ( see Note 15 ).2. The entire 3 ml culture is added to 100 ml of fresh expression medium and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm in an incubator shaker until the OD reached 0.5-1.0 at 600 nm wavelength ( see Note 16 ).3. The cultures are induced by addition of IPTG to a fi nal concentration of 1 mM (add 1 ml of sterile 100 mM IPTG solution). The induced cultures are incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm in an incubator shaker for another 4 h.4. The bacterial cultures are harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The cell pellet can be immediately processed or frozen stored at \u221220 or \u221280 \u00b0C until processed ( see Note 17 ).1. Resuspend the cell pellet completely in 5 ml of BugBuster reagent per gram of wet cell weight ( see Note 18 ).",
