The protocol and equipment used for pulmonary function testing in this study were similar to those used in an earlier study9 that we conducted among recovered SARS patients. Spirometry was performed in accordance with recommended standards.14 All of the lung function tests were performed with the subjects seated and on the same day, but after patients had answered the health status questionnaire. FVC and FEV1 were measured with a clinical spirometer (\nV\u02d9max 229; SensorMedics; Yorba Linda, CA). Total lung capacity and its subdivisions were measured by the nitrogen washout method with the spirometer, the testing adhered to standard criteria.15 The Dlco was determined by the single-breath carbon monoxide technique16 using an infrared analyzer (\nV\u02d9max 229). Dlco was adjusted for a hemoglobin concentration of 14.6 g/dL for men and 13.4 g/dL for women.16 The spirometry, lung volumes, and Dlco measurements were expressed as the percentages of predicted normal values using reference values taken from the prediction equations of Chia et al17 and Poh and Chia.18 The rating of impairment was made according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement19 for the evaluation of impairment/disability secondary to respiratory disorders.",

However, several cases of abnormalities in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Dlco were detected. According to the ATS recommendations19 for evaluating respiratory impairment, 11 patients (12%) had mild impairment of FVC, 20 (21%) had mild impairment of FEV1, 5 (5%) had mild impairment of FEV1/FVC ratio, and 17 (18%) had mild impairment of Dlco. There was one patient (1%) with moderate impairment of FVC, one patient (1%) with moderate impairment of FEV1/FVC ratio, and three patients (3%) with moderate impairment of Dlco. Because there were cases of patients with impairment in more than one of the four variables, the number of patients with mild and moderate impairment according to the ATS recommendations was 30 (32%) and 5 (5%), respectively.

The majority of the impairment in FEV1 and FVC suggests a restrictive abnormality, but in only eight patients was the total lung capacity (TLC) < 80% predicted. Two patients had obstructive abnormality with an FEV1/FVC ratio < 70% predicted, and one of them (patient No. 17 in Table 4) had a history of poorly controlled bronchial asthma. The other patient (patient No. 12 in Table 4) had a significant history of cigarette smoking. None of the other patients who had respiratory impairment were current or ex-smokers.

Using multivariate analysis to analyze the association between known prognostic indicators of SARS,2 namely, age, gender, comorbidity, serum LDH level, ribavarin level, and steroid use, and the 1-year pulmonary function outcomes, we found that only age was significantly associated with the FVC percent predicted (every year increase, \u22120.34; 95% confidence interval, \u22120.6 to \u22120.08; p = 0.01) and with the FEV1 percent predicted (every year increase, \u22120.26; 95% confidence interval, \u22120.5 to \u22120.01; p = 0.04), but none of the prognostic factors were significantly associated with the Dlco percent predicted. Among patients who required intensive care and mechanical ventilation during the acute illness, there was no significant association among the duration of mechanical ventilation, the Pao\n2/Fio\n2 ratio on admission to the ICU, steroid usage, and the pulmonary function parameters at 1 year after hospital discharge. All 94 of the patients completed the SGRQ. Domain scores other than the symptoms domain of the SGRQ were significantly higher (ie, worse) than the population norms (Table 6\n).",

In assessing long-term outcomes after acute lung injury, it is important to attempt the consecutive enrollment of survivors with defined time points for study, because there is a possibility of bias toward the selection of sicker patients with abnormal pulmonary function test results if studies enrolled any patient who returned for a follow-up evaluation. In an earlier prospective study9 of pulmonary function tests in 46 recovered SARS patients at a uniform time point of 3 months after hospital discharge, we found 7 patients (15%) with mild impairment of FVC, 12 patients (26%) with mild impairment of FEV1, 17 patients (37%) with mild impairment of Dlco, and 1 patient (2%) with moderate impairment of Dlco. Overall, pulmonary function defects were detected in half of the recovered SARS patients at 3 months after hospital discharge. The finding in the present study of persistent pulmonary function abnormalities in a significant proportion of SARS patients 1 year after hospital discharge is notable, not only for the long-term follow-up and management of these patients but also as a highlight of the permanent respiratory impairment that can result from the acute infection. Viral pneumonia usually resolves without any clinical or radiologic sequelae, whereas SARS-related radiologic sequelae appear to be quite common among survivors, as observed by several studies.8, 21\n",

This appears to be in contrast to information from several reviews22, 23 on survivors of the ARDS documenting the persistence of a mild reduction in Dlco as the most common abnormality found in pulmonary function testing, and that Dlco remained low in long-term follow-ups. Interestingly, all of the articles on ARDS survivors reporting normal lung volumes or very low rates of either obstruction or restriction were published earlier when cohorts were likely more heterogeneous, and lung injuries in the surviving population were most likely less severe.24, 25, 26 In more recent studies, the proportion of patients with ventilatory impairment has ranged constantly higher, from 18 to 33% for airway obstruction and from 15 to 45% for lung restriction.27, 28, 29, 30 In particular, Neff et al31 have reported that residual restrictive and obstructive types of functional impairment remained common (25% of patients with each type) in survivors of severe ARDS, and only 12.5% of patients had impairment in Dlco.",

Adverse long-term pulmonary sequelae of the ARDS include lung fibrosis, but untreated bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia and bronchiolitis obliterans may also contribute to the physical morbidity in ARDS survivors.32 In addition, neuromuscular weakness may also contribute to the decline in pulmonary function.33 A recent study8 correlating high-resolution CT scan findings and pulmonary function in survivors of SARS during the early recovery phase (ie, 25 to 38 days after hospital discharge) found that FEV1, FVC, TLC, residual volume, and Dlco correlated well with the severity of ground-glass opacification and fibrosis. The presence of fibrosis was associated with significantly lower pulmonary function variables.

This is likely attributable to an improvement in symptoms with time of recovery. In studies among survivors of ARDS, it is known that nearly all of the patients are symptomatic at hospital discharge, but there is significant improvement over the first year after ARDS in most patients.11 In addition, survivors of ARDS are also much less symptomatic than other patients with chronic lung disease.11 Nonetheless, the mean activity score of our patients measuring disturbances to their daily physical activity and their mean impacts score covering a wide range of disturbances of psychosocial function remain significantly worse compared with those in healthy subjects. Physical morbidity in SARS survivors may also stem from extrapulmonary causes. In an earlier study9 evaluating pulmonary function and exercise capacity among patients from the same cohort, we found no evidence of exercise limitation solely because of ventilatory constraints, and there were very few patients with significant oxygen desaturation during exercise. Hence, the disability represented by an increased (ie, worse) score on the SGRQ activity domain in the present study is not likely to be specific to intrinsic pulmonary dysfunction, especially given that pulmonary dysfunction in our patients is modest, but may instead reflect any cause of impaired physical functioning, such as muscle loss/weakness or neuromuscular disease. Corticosteroid myopathy may be a contributory factor, although only a small percentage of our patients had received treatment with steroids during their acute illness.",

First, the heterogeneity of acute lung disease encompassed by the case definition of SARS may account for the observed variation in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae among our patients. Second, the proportion of patients who declined evaluation may have led to a bias toward the selection of sicker patients with abnormal pulmonary function. This is likely, because most of the patients who declined participation in the study offered a lack of symptoms and inconvenience as the main reasons for doing so. Third, evaluations of arterial blood gas levels and exercise testing were not performed in this study. However, we did not anticipate that there was significant hypoxemia in these patients, because none of them was found to have hypoxemia or was assessed as requiring oxygen supplementation during routine follow-up. Cardiopulmonary responses to exercise in SARS survivors had been evaluated in an earlier study9 at 3 months after hospital discharge, but we do not have any longer term data on this. Fourth, only a respiratory-specific measure of health status was used in this study. A generic health status measure, such as the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey, would have provided a more global assessment of the patients, especially with regard to their role limitations as a result of emotional problems, mental health, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. The interaction of the data obtained from generic and disease-specific measures of health status may also have helped to determine the contributions of pulmonary and nonpulmonary factors to the long-term health status of SARS survivors.",
