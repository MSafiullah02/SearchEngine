Based on their antigenic characteristics and sequence analyses of the VP6 gene, viruses within the Rotavirus genus are primarily classified into 9 distinct groups/species (A\u2013I) (ICTV, 2017; Matthijnssens et al., 2012; Mihalov-Kovacs et al., 2015); a newly-proposed species J has been described in the bat (Banyai et al., 2017). The VP7 and VP4 genes encode 2 structural proteins responsible for the induction of the immune protective response and are used for the binary classification of RVA strains in terms of their G and P genotypes, respectively. Currently, 36 G and 51 P genotypes are recognized by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group (RCWG, 2017).",

In France, Kaplon et al. (2013) evaluated beef cattle herds subject to extensive management and found no differences in the frequencies of diarrhea and RVA-positive fecal samples between vaccinated and unvaccinated herds; the majority of the genotyped RVA-positive diarrheic fecal samples were found to have the same genotype (G6P[5]) as that of the vaccine strain.",

In humans, the World Health Organization recommends the inclusion of the RVA vaccination in all national immunization programs (WHO, 2009). Several studies have demonstrated that vaccination does not totally eliminate the risk of infection, but it certainly reduces both the frequency and severity of the episodes of neonatal diarrhea caused by RVA infection in calves (Kaplon et al., 2013; Parreno et al., 2004). Considering that the immune pressure exerted by routine vaccination may have the potential to select strains containing specific G and P genotypes, it is important to monitor the genotypes present in the RVA strains that are circulating among and within vaccinated cattle herds (Cashman et al., 2010).",

In addition, the genotype G6P[5], present in the RVA vaccine strain used on the farm, was not identified in any RVA field strains identified in calves in this study. Additionally, the presence of the RVA G10P[11] genotype was verified, which was different from the vaccine strain, reinforcing the vaccine protection. The presence of RVA in vaccinated herds may occurs due to immune pressure, individual factors, management procedures, nutrition, and environmental variations. The constant monitoring of circulating RVA strains in neonatal diarrhea in dairy cattle herds is important to identify the emergence of new RVA strains, highlighting those with higher virulence and/or zoonotic potential.",
