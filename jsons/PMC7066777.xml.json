            "text": "TIBOLA commonly occurs in women and young people and has been reported in European countries such as France, Spain, and Hungary, particularly in cold seasons. Rickettsia slovaca is known to be the most commonly confirmed etiologic agent of TIBOLA, and the most frequently identified vector is Dermacentor marginatus [15]. The scalp area is recognized as the most common site for tick bites. One possible explanation for this is that Dermacentor ticks can stick to long hair, which plays a role as a shelter. Among TIBOLA entities, disease entity with both the eschar in the scalp and the neck lymphadenopathy are recognized as a new clinical entity named by SENLAT [8], as in our case. SENLAT has characteristic epidemiological findings that occur frequently in females and young children and are seasonal bimodality (spring and autumn) [4]. Although Rickettsia slovaca is the most common pathogen in this syndrome, other several agents like Rickettsia raoultii, Rickettisa sibirica subsp. mongolitimonae, Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Candidatus Rickettsia rioja are also known as etiological pathogens [4]. The patient in our case had an eschar lesion on his right scalp, and a superficial enlarged right cervical lymph node, consistent with SENLAT. The result of the nested PCR, using a sample from the enlarged node, was positive for Bartonella species in a genus-specific ITS gene, and the sequencing results confirmed Bartonella henselae to be the cause of infection. And then, based on previous several literature showing that water deer living in Korea serve as a reservoirs of Bartonella species [16, 17], we believed that B. henselae identified in our patient originated from a water deer contacted prior to our hospital visit. In our case, the tick residing on the water deer may have bitten the patient, and hence infected him with B. henselae. As the patient had discarded the tick, we could not investigate the role of the tick as a vector. Dermacentor ticks are, however, known to be absent in Korea [18]. Cotte et al. showed in their experimental study that potential transmission of B. henselae is possible with Ixodes ricinus ticks [19]. Therefore, one cannot exclude a possibility that SENLAT could have been caused by Ixodes nipponensis, which is frequently observed in Korea [20]. In addition, the water deer may be the source of the tick, but it is not clear, and the natural environment may have been the tick source. However, further study is needed to confirm this.",

All 3 of their examples occurred in the colder months in Europe, and the authors suggested that Dermacentor ticks are most active during these periods. The occurrence of SENLAT has mainly been reported in Europe. However, no cases of SENLAT have been reported in Asia.",
