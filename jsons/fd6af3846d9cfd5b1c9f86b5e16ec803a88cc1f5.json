Levels of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets are of great importance to keep the immune system functional.

In addition to reductions in T lymphocyte level, reductions of B lymphocyte and NK cell levels are observed in patients with SARS. Because of the depletion of lymphocytes, leukopenia or a low-normal leukocyte count is noted in some patients. All these findings are quite different from those associated with pneumonia caused by common respiratory viruses, which usually is associated with a normal or elevated lymphocyte count [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 651, "end": 655, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Our results with respect to the levels of T cell subsets support the hypothesis that, in patients with SARS, the percentage of CD4 + T cells is much lower than that of CD8 + T cells. This implies that CD4 + T cells are more severely damaged by the SARS virus than are CD8 + T cells. However, 87% of the patients with SARS also show decreases in of the CD8 + T cell level, in contrast to the findings for patients with HIV infection. In general, the adaptive immune response to viral infections occurs by means of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. CTLs are generated in response to an invading pathogen, and they specifically recognize and kill virus-infected cells and/or release inhibitory antiviral soluble factors [12, 13] . Therefore, CD8 + T cell counts should be sharply increased in patients with SARS. The mechanism of reduction of CD8 + T cell counts in patients with SARS needs further investigation. The human immune system shows a different response to the SARS coronavirus than it does to HIV and other viruses. Our study shows that the absolute counts of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells have clinical significance in patients with SARS and that surveillance of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of SARS.
