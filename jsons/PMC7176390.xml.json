Pregnant women are currently not recognised as a population at increased risk; however, they might still be vulnerable for not only medical but also social risks. Additionally, prenatal and delivery care provides unique opportunities to answer key questions about COVID-19, including the collection of population-based estimates of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections.",

Published studies to date seem to be reassuring that pregnant women with COVID-19 might not be at increased risk for severe complications or adverse reproductive health outcomes. However, studies have been limited to case series and case reports and lack sufficient numbers to discern infrequent risks attributable to COVID-19 infection. Reports have also been conflicting and inconclusive as to whether vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur.3, 4\n",

Sentinel surveillance systems could be enhanced or implemented to improve understanding of the disease course and complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and their effect on adverse pregnancy, fetal, and infant outcomes. Leveraging existing pregnancy registries and mother\u2013baby linked longitudinal surveillance to capture clinical and outcome information for COVID-19 could help to facilitate rapid data collection for public health action.5 Additionally, population-based studies could help to elucidate the risks of infection and whether risk varies by gestational age and other medical and social factors. The large global network of cohort studies launched to study Zika virus and pregnancy could be mobilised rapidly to organise such global data collection.6 As new COVID-19 treatments and vaccines become available, a global research network will be crucial in evaluating their use among pregnant women.",

These data could be particularly important for SARS-CoV-2 infections, many of which have been reported to be asymptomatic.7 Blood samples collected during prenatal care or at delivery can be used to generate population-based estimates of infectious disease seroprevalence. For example, population-based estimates of HIV seroprevalence are often derived from sentinel prenatal clinics.8 Although prenatal care might be interrupted during the pandemic and case-based surveillance of acute infections delayed or restricted, serology after circulation allows estimation of past infections and an improved understanding of the epidemiology of affected pregnancies. In addition to prenatal care, samples can be collected at delivery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period. Cohort studies also allow access to stored blood samples. Control samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period would allow detection of previous circulation of similar viruses and potential background cross-reactivity.",
