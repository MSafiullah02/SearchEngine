In line with the salutogenic approach, the aim of the current research was to investigate protective and risk factors to burnout. Research has indicated that sense of coherence (SOC) may act as a protective factor. Studies reported that loneliness has been found a risk factor that may advance burnout. The current study hypothesized that loneliness may moderate the link between SOC and burnout. In a sample of 104 Israeli school psychologists, demographic aspects such as the gender, years of experience, or type of school in which they work did not predict the burnout, focusing on the importance of emotional aspects. The analysis demonstrated that the SOC was negatively associated with burnout among low or mean levels of loneliness, but not among psychologists with high levels of loneliness. The current study provides a new insight into the burnout risk, through the focus on personal resources and social perceptions. Implications for theoretical and practices are further discussed.",

School psychologists are trained to deliver mental and behavioral health services for children and adolescents, to intervene at the individual and system level, and develop, implement, and evaluate preventive programs. It is considered to be a highly demanding occupation since school psychologists cope with wide-ranging occupation responsibilities and thus are at higher risk to develop work related stress and burnout (Bell and McKenzie 2013) . For example, in a recent study, school psychologists in four South-eastern states in USA reported that they experienced burnout, and attributed its causes to their feelings of role overload and to the lack of adequate support from administration (Schilling et al. 2018) . The goals of the current study are to examine personal resources that predict the burnout experience among school psychologists in Israel. In line with the Salutogenic approach that focus attention on sources of health and empowerment (Antonovsky 1987) , the current study explored factors that may reduce the burnout. Maslach (2001, p. 189 ) defined burnout as \"a psychological syndrome that involves prolonged response to stressors in the workplace\". Job burnout includes feeling exhausted physically, emotionally, and /or mentally, in the context of work. The construct consists of three major components (Maslach and Jackson 1981) :",

The COR theory has proposed that people strive to obtain, maintain and create resources that they value, and the loss of these resources and values will lead to stress. Within this model, burnout has been conceptualized as physical exhaustion from an excessive workload that is likely to make individuals feel overwhelmed and unable to meet their work's related goals. The heavy workload decreases time to consider how to mobilize resources. The complexity of problems can be beyond their resources.",

Organizational factors are comprised of rigid hierarchies, demanding values and the management model in the organization. Personal demographic factors may include socio-demographic variables such as gender, age, and education. Personality characteristics such as perfectionism, pessimism and high excitability also increase the risk of developing burnout symptoms (Keinan and Melamed 1987) . In line with the COR approach, personal resources such as coping skills and interpersonal resources such as social support are significant characteristic resources, that may buffer the risk of the burnout. The occurrence of burnout syndrome has been described in diverse occupations, and it was often related to activities of caring, advising, healing or protecting (Weber and Jaekel-Reinhard 2000) and connected not only with overload demands at work, difficult critical decision making, but also with compassion fatigue, which is extreme distress resulting from helping others that suffer (Ledoux 2015) .",

School psychologists are trained in a variety of treatment and diagnostic methods in order to provide services to a range of educational settings. This high demanding caring profession may predispose them to burnout. An early longitudinal study of the burnout of school psychologist reported the stability of the distress and focused attention on the role of environmental and personality variables (e.g., extraversion, agreeableness) in predicting burnout (Mills and Huebner 1998) . Sandoval (1993) further confirmed the role of personality factors in predicting the burnout of school psychologists, but he identified a different set of personality characteristics. He proposed that individuals who are well-adjusted, free of neurotic trends, mature, optimistic and having a wide range of interest are less prone to burnout. Focusing on the differences between studies, Sandoval (1993) proposed that \"individuals who are not well adjusted are more prone to burnout (Sandoval 1993, p. 325 ) and proposed that the Big Five personality variables accounted for the burnout. Recent studies have indicated that estimates of burnout across mental health services are higher than in other professions and school psychologists in particular are at a higher risk for experiencing burnout (Rodriguez and Carlotto 2017) .",

The SOC enables individuals to make use of adaptive coping strategies and, thus, may buffer against the negative effects of stress (Antonovsky 1987) .",

Research emphasized the importance of the subjective perceptions of social support (Eagle et al. 2019) . Thus, we hypothesized that the levels of loneliness as reflections of dissatisfaction from the social relations will moderate the protective effects of SOC on the burnout levels of school psychologists. The results confirmed the expectations. When loneliness levels were average or low, SOC was a protective factor, but not when the social distress levels were high. In an earlier study the loneliness was directly related to the burnout during residency of the medical profession (Shapiro et al. 2015 ). In the current study it was not directly related to burnout, but it reduced the beneficial impact of SOC as a protective factor. This finding support previous research indicating that loneliness did not affect directly the burnout, but has diminished the beneficial effects of psychological resources (Huo and Kong 2014; Marroqu\u00edn et al. 2016 ). In addition, the current results emphasized the detrimental impact only of high levels of loneliness. This differentiation between different levels of loneliness is in line with the Salutogenic construct that has rejected a dichotomy conceptualization of the construct (lonely or not lonely). Considering loneliness as part of our typical life, everybody may experience lower levels of social distress as typical life experiences. However, only high levels of loneliness have to be treated as a risk factor.",

It has focused attention on the paradoxical role of the school psychologists, whose work targets the emotional and social challenges of teachers, parents and children, while this type of caring work exposed them to increased stress and feeling that many times they are standing alone while facing numerous stresses related to prevention and solving personal and systemic challenges and reducing the psychological distress in the educational systems. Although in earlier studies (Mills and Huebner 1998; Sandoval 1993) , personality characteristics were related to burnout, the unique contribution of this study is its focus on the importance of the SOC, and the different levels of loneliness as a moderator of the beneficial impact of SOC. We prepare school psychologists to meet the needs of the students, families and teachers, but their needs may be neglected. The results of the study call for meeting their own needs for on-going support to reduce the risk of loneliness, while empowering their SOC (i.e., their understanding and manageability of situational demands, and their meaningful active involvement in a variety of important events). The practical therapeutic implications of the study call for developing programs to empower the SOC of professionals and enhancing partnerships within a supportive network of educational psychologists' centers. Awareness to the threat of burnout and compassion fatigue (Kaeding et al. 2017 ) calls for preventive planning. In order to reduce the risk of burnout and enhance professionals wellbeing, and in line with the recommendations of the Consensus Study Report (National Academy of Medicine 2019) intervention planning have to integrate programs that will target individuals as well as the environmental conditions. This report showed that currently, interventions that significantly address clinician burnout are limited and requested extended studies and programs. The current study has suggested awareness to program that may enhance personal sense of coherence (e.g., Kahonen et al. 2012) . Within the systemic consideration, it may also be beneficial to focus on social support from colleagues and management from the early stages of the psychological career in order to reduce feelings of high loneliness.",
