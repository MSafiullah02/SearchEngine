Wang Duo and Zhao Xiaofei found that the change and development of epidemic situation would be nearly described with Kermarck-Mckendric model after they made a verifiable Autonomous Dynamics System for SARS Epidemic 915 analysis and prediction of epidemic situation of SARS on the basis of the original K-M dynamic model TM . The model was too simple to take the birth rate and density constraint of susceptible population and the cure and death rates of patients into consideration.

If there is a solution of the system (1) satisfying that E(t) ,I(t) are non-positive, then let t o denote the first point in the direction of number axis satisfying that E(t) or I(t) is equal to zero. When E(t) is equal to zero, from the second equation of the system ( 1 ), we have E'(to) = k(to)I(to) > 0. For the point t of infinitely near the point t o and t < to, there is E(t) < 0. It is in contradiction with the to' s definition. Similarly, if I(t) is equal to zero, from the third equation of the system ( 1 ), we also have the contradiction with the t o ' s definition. Hence all solutions of the system ( 1 ) satisfying the initiate conditions (2) are positive. Let us denote R3 \u00a7 = { (S,E;I) :S >~ O,E >I 0,I >-0}.

The infection-free equilibrium E: = (a/b ,0,0) of the system (1) for R o < 1 is the local asymptotically stable equilibrium point. At R o > 1, E/is unstable. Let us turn to analyze the local stability of the endemic disease equilibrium point E+= (S*,E*,I*) = (d +be (d +be)(ak-b(d +be)) ak-b(d +be)) A-(a-2bS* -kI*)](A + A)(A +d +l~) -AkS*[A-(a-2bS* -kI*)] =0, namely, [A -(a-2bS* -kI*) ](a 2 + (A +d+/z)a +A(d+/z) -AkS*) = O. Let us replace S*, I* by Eq. (3) to the above equation, we have A(A +b(d+ix)/k)(a+A +d+/z) =0. (8) Thus Eq. (8) has a zero root, namely, the positive equilibrium point of the system ( 1 ) is instable. We can obtain Theorem 2. Theorem 2 There is the unique endemic equilibrium point E+ ( S* ,E* ,I* ) of the system (1) for R o = ak/( b( d +ix) ) > 1, and E+ ( S* ,E* ,I* ) is critically stable but not asymptotically stable. 3 Global Asymptotic Stability By Theorem 1, we know that the infection-free equilibrium Ef = (a/b,O,O) of the system (1) for R o < 1 is the local asymptotically stable equilibrium point and the positive equilibrium point does not exist. We also know that the infection-free equilibrium E I = ( a/b ,0,0) of the system ( 1 ) forR 0 > 1 is instable and the positive equilibrium point exists. There is E+ (S* ,E* ,I* ) --~ Ef(a/b ,0,0) for R 0 ~ 1. In Theorem 3 we discuss the global asymptotic stability of Ef = ( a/b ,0,0). Theorem 3 If R o <~ 1, then the infection-free equilibrium Ef = (a/b ,0,0) of the system (1) is global asymptotically stable in R3 \u00a7 Proof Here we still use ~Q of Eq. (4) as the subset in R3 \u00a7 . Let -3 R+o denote {(S,E,I) e R3+o I S > 0t. Consider Liapunov function V:R3 \u00a7 ~ R,V(S,E,I) = (S -(a/b)lnS) + E + L Calculating the differential of the V(S,E,I) at the direction of the system (1Eq. (9) we can know that -b ( S -a/b ) 2 is negative. If R0 < 1, then ( d + t* -ka/b ) I is also negative. Hence V'(t) I r < 0 is correct. IfR 0 = 1, then V'(t) I r < 0, namely, V'(t) I~1) is always negative and V'(t) I0) = 0 if and only ifS = a/b,I = 0. Because of N = {(S,E,I) I V(S,E,I) Io) = 0 } = {(I,E,I) I S = a/b,E>>-O,I = 0 } N a, the biggest invariant set of N is ET = (a/b,O,O).

(10) are positive> (02 k(a/b -r ' then (02 > (02(d +ix)/(k(a/b -r and (d +ix)/(k(a/b -r < 1, or b(d +ix)/(ak) < 1 -(b/a)r Hence it is easy to testify that if (d +ix)/k < a/b -6 (here the positive equilibrium point S * exists and S* < a/b), then for any 8 ~ ( 0, a/b -S* ), b ( d + IX) / (ak) < 1 -(b/a) 6 holds true. As long as we correctly select (0,, (0z, Eq. ( 11 ) holds. Thus there is 6 > 0 satisfying V'(E,I) I(1 ) > 6V(E,I) inI r V(E,I) ---.+ ~ holds for t---~+ ~o.

This proves Lenuna 3. Theorem 4 The infection-free equilibrium E s = ( a/b ,0,0) in [20 for R o > 1 is the strong uniform repellence. Proof Here we make use of the norm definition II (S,E,I) II = I s I +1 E I +1 II. By Lemma 3 we can choose 6 e (0, a/b -S* ) satisfying ( S,E, I) E /2o for R 0 > 1. Thus there is t o I> 0 satisfying II (s(t) ,E(t) ,I(t)) -(a/b,O,O) II >11 S(t) -a/b t > e, for t i> to, which implied that there is ~ > 0 satisfying liminf d((S,E,I) ,EI) > e, where d((S,E,I) ,E:) = inf II (S,E,I) -(a/b,O,O) II. By Definition 1, Theorem 4 holds. Applying Definition 2 and Theorem 4 we are able to deduce the most important Theorem 5 rs3. Theorem 5 The system ( 1 ) is the strong uniform permanent existence for R o > 1, namely, there is min { liminf S(t) , liminf E(t) , liminf I(t) } >I e for r > 0 and any solution ( S( t) ,E( t) ,I( t) ) of the system (1",
