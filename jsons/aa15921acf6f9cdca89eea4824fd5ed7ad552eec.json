            "text": "Repeated diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopies may bring in pathogens of nosocomial infections by the use of the endoscope if no reliable reprocessing is performed after its use. Furthermore, regularly reprocessed endoscopes might be contaminated by the staff, the working environment, or the patients and thus represent a source of contamination if the basic principles of infection prevention are not observed. It depends on the type and extent of tissue traumatization, the local and systemic defense of the patient, and the pathogen, if infection develops after the application of a contaminated endoscope. If the protective mucosal barrier is injured during an endoscopically assisted intervention, the pathogens can enter from exterior or from the surface bacteria, possibly even via the endoscope into the tissue. Thus the infection risk increases with the invasiveness of the intervention [3] . However, even during rhino-neurosurgical surgeries with their inevitably broad opening of the dura, the associated risk is relatively low: the rate of intracranial infections in those maximized interventions is given with 1.6% and the infection-related mortality with 0.125%. It is comparable to the one of transcranial surgeries without endoscope [4] . Nosocomial pathogens in the ENT field found in the nasal vestibulum are mainly Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA but also Streptococcus pneumonia and other Streptococcus spp., Candida albicans, and Gram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella spp., E. coli, Proteus spp., H. influenza, and P. aeruginosa as well as representatives of the resident flora such as Bacteriodes spp. and Corynebacterium spp. [5] . In 2003, the Creutzfeld-Jakob prion protein (PrP Sc ) was found for the first time in cadavers with sporadic CJD in the olfactory epithelium [6] , so that the KRINKO-BfArM recommendation [1] defined the olfactory epithelium as high risk tissue in ENT surgery. Examinations of nasal brushing specimens indicate that further evaluations of this situation are required [7] . Different microbial habitats of more than 25,000 species are found in the oral cavity [8] , [9] . In the free oral cavity, aerobe organisms are predominant while for example in the subgingival space anaerobes such as Actinomyces, Fusobacteria, and Peptostreptococci are found. Viruses in the upper respiratory tract that are particularly relevant are rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, Coxsacki A viruses, influenza A viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, adenoviruses, and para-influenza viruses, but also enteroviruses [10] , [11] . The paranasal sinuses and the larynx are physiologically not colonized despite the density and multitude of microorganisms found in neighboring biotopes [12] . In contrast to gastroscopy, bronchoscopy, and arthroscopy [13] the data situation regarding the infectious risk of ENT specific instruments is rather scarce [14] , the irregular reprocessing of instruments is supposed to cause a high infection risk. This thesis is supported by the results of an investigation of laryngoscopes used in anesthesia that were simply wiped with disinfectant tissues between the applications [15] . Under those conditions, the instruments were contaminated after insufficient reprocessing in 22% and before use (because of meanwhile occurred contamination) in 86% of the cases with critical pathogens [16] .",

            "text": "Each endoscopically assisted surgery requires careful indication and planning of the intervention also with regard to hygienic aspects. Patients who have a high risk of MRSA or MRGN colonization should be identified and examined microbiologically short-term before elective interventions if the mentioned pathogens bear the risk of additional danger for the patient [17], [18] . Visceral surgery has already implemented this concept [19] . Regarding diagnostic endoscopy, the following aspects must be considered. Via patient contact surfaces, working surfaces, and surfaces of medical devices pathogens may reach a patient by using hands or also by direct patient contact [20] . So the disinfection of the hands and surfaces near the patient are essential as part of basic hygiene. Before purchase of each medical device it is necessary to think about the performance and the efforts and costs of the reprocessing. The user has to write down for every medical device if, how often, and with which procedure it will be reprocessed. According to the German law ( [21] , \u00a74), generally the reprocessing of medical devices that are properly applied with low microbiological contamination or sterile has to be performed with consideration of the manufacturer's information with appropriate validated procedures so that the success of those procedures is traceably assured; and the security and health of patients, users, or third parties is not endangered. An appropriate reprocessing is assumed when the KRINKO-BfArM recommendations [1] are observed. The requirements have to be applied to the outpatient and the inpatient sectors. In accordance to the use and the material properties, endoscopes must be reprocessed before they are used again. The suitability and effectiveness of the reprocessing procedures must be clarified by product-specific validated tests [1] . The validation proves that with observation of the determined process parameters and methods under different conditions a defined quality of reprocessing is always traceably achieved. For determination of the reprocessing, endoscopes have to be classified according to the specific requirements of reprocessing. The user is responsible for the correct classification of the medical devices in consideration of the manufacturer's data. Endoscopes used in otorhinolaryngology do not have a working channel, they are only in contact with (probably pathological) mucosa or skin and as they do not penetrate them during diagnostic measures, they are classified as medical device of the category \"semicritical A\". For the reprocessing of medical devices classified higher than \"semicritical A\", the medical and nursing staff have to dispose of a special knowledge that can be acquired in the context of special trainings and courses, e.g. certificate of competence in \"processing of endoscopes\" or other courses with a curriculum in accordance to DGSV. Based on the KRINKO-BfArM recommendation [1] , automatic as well as manual reprocessing are generally allowed for ENT endoscopes with diagnostic use. Still, automatic reprocessing is preferred due to the reduced time and personnel costs and an easier standardization. While the validation of automatic reprocessing is often performed by the manufacturer [22] , [23], validation of manual reprocessing (including every single step) must be provided by the user himself or on his behalf. Disinfectants must be VAH-certified and recommended by the manufacturer to ensure effectiveness as well as compatibility with the materials of the medical device. The same principle is applied to previous cleaning and final rinsing, i.e. every single step of the whole process must be defined, validated, and determined in an SOP. Considering the manufacturer's data, the responsible person writes down and determines the procedures that are applied (every single step) and the conditions (e.g. rooms, equipment, qualification of the staff) under which his medical devices are reprocessed and stored. The SOPs have to mention explicitly all critical steps of the process. They are periodically checked in order to prove the continuous effectiveness.",

That is why the application of glutaral and peracetic acid are not recommended for pre-cleaning and cleaning [25] . According to the KRINKO-BfArM recommendation [1] the disinfectant has to have a bactericidal (including mycobacteria), fungicidal, and virucidal effect. In contrast, the guideline of the DGKH, DGSV, AKI, and VAH regarding the manual reprocessing contains reduced requirements concerning the range of effects [2] . If the olfactory epithelium is penetrated or biopsies are taken from the olfactory region, the view is taken that reprocessing should also assure the effectiveness against prions [1] . With regard to the still unknown actual risk of this aspect, these circumstances should be analyzed more intensively in order to avoid writing down possibly exaggerated and precipitate demands. For start-up and operation of cleaning and disinfection devices the check lists of the KRINKO-BfArM recommendation [1] with their enclosures 3 and 4 are helpful. The requirements for the device, the process validation (consisting of installation, operation, and performance qualifications), the periodical or batch-related routine checks, the measurement supervision and the control of the process parameters, the periodical checks of the procedures (re-evaluation of the performance), and the event-related checks of the procedures (performance assessment based on a specific event) are listed there.",

The following description focuses on the data of the questionnaire revealing the reprocessing of medical devices. Information on hand disinfection is added because deficiencies in hand hygiene might be an origin of contamination of already reprocessed endoscopes. Regarding hand hygiene, partly severe deficiencies could be identified (see Table 1 ). The table reveals that hand disinfection is considered more important for self-protection because the hands are disinfected always after treatment of high risk patients and after contamination, but not before and after every treatment of patients. It is critical that some staff members have artificial or gelled fingernails. There are several reasons to refuse this habit. The density of bacteria on those artificial nails is much higher than on natural ones. At the same time, artificial nails mislead to neglecting washing of the hands and they increase the risk of perforating the protective gloves [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] . Repeatedly, artificial nails could be identified as reason for surgical site infections [34] , [35] , [36] . Jewelry for hands and forearms hinder proper hand hygiene and may be a reservoir for pathogens. A correlation between the number of rings and the number of Gram-negative bacteria and Staph. aureus could be found in the intensive care staff [37] . When the nurses had rings on their fingers, an increased rate of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters could be found on the hands, however, an increased transmission rate could not be revealed [38] , [39] . Finally, rings increase the risk of injuries as well as the rate of perforations for single-use gloves [40] , [41] . Putting those data in relation to the conditions of reprocessing of medical devices, several deficiencies become obvious. They are for example due to a lack of competence and expertise (see Table 2 ). Other specific articles identify the missing instructions and SOPs as severe deficits [42] . Such deficits may lead for example at the occasion of inspections by health authorities to important measures such as the outsourcing of reprocessing until appropriate instructions are elaborated.",

            "text": "Regarding the reprocessing of rigid and flexible endoscopes, the survey reveals -despite the aspect of the few responses -that the hygienic requirements of reprocessing endoscopes are not observed to an adequate extent (see Table 3 ). The endoscopes are mostly reprocessed manually. This fact corresponds to data in the literatures: a survey of private practices performing outpatient surgeries (including ENT practices) made by the health authorities of Frankfurt/Main, Germany, showed that the reprocessing of instruments was carried out manually in 93% [43] . In dental practices the situation in 2005 with manual reprocessing was slightly better [44] . A report published 2008 by the Federal Ministry of Health also drew the conclusion that cleaning and disinfection in private practices is nearly always performed manually. The reason is the financial burden [45] . The statement is given that changes of these suboptimal procedures would require specific official instructions [43] . In this sense, the new infection protection law of 2011 [46] and the updated hygiene regulations increase the requirements for the structural and process quality of hospital hygiene. The users have to face stricter planning and documentation obligations with tighter reporting duties, a supervision by the public health service was established [47] . Endoscopy did not only enlarge the treatment options in otorhinolaryngology but it also made efficient minimally invasive procedures possible. In order to fully understand the benefit of this technique it is necessary to know about the risks associated with thin intervention and to avoid undesired events. Infections are an important part of those undesired events. The current hygiene standards seem to allow the reduction of the rate of known infections to a minimum. Thus a lowering of the standard must not be discussed. In contrast, increasing claims of patient safety always have to be in a balanced relationship to the affordability of the medical services. Hygienic aspects have to be integrated effectively and economically in the treatment procedures. Especially functional units with a high rate of interventions and patient flow, optimized processes implementing hygiene and patient safety play a decisive role. Generally, automatic cleaning and disinfection procedures are preferred because of the higher safety [48] and reproducibility and because of the staff protection. The manual reprocessing of endoscopes for diagnostic use, however, is allowed unless the whole process is validated. For revalidation, there are no timely requirements; generally the interval is suggested by the validator. According to the Medical Device Directive [21] , the manufacturer of medical devices is obliged to define the reprocessing procedures on the basis of the process validation. Unfortunately, there are partly enormous deficiencies regarding the definitions of manufacturers [49] . The responsibility for hygiene belongs to the physician or the director of the institution. He can delegate hygienic measures according to the qualification of the staff members. In every institution performing surgeries a link physician for infection control must be nominated up to 2016 (depending on the federal state, it may even be earlier) [46] who has passed a basic course on hygienic matters of 40 hours or an e-learning curriculum. This does not apply to institutions where only diagnostic endoscopies are performed. The hygiene plan must contain detailed measures according to the peculiarities of the institution [46] . Further, this hygiene plan has to distributed and explained to all staff members at the occasion of their employment, which has to be documented. If changes occur in the working field or new products or processes are introduced, the hygiene plan has to be changed accordingly. The instructions of the hygiene plan have to be repeated and documented regularly -at least once per year [46] . For surgically working institutions the prospective clinical surveillance of postoperative wound infections is obligatory. To meet the requirements it is recommended to choose a representative marker operation [50] , [51] .",
