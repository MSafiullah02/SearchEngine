            "text": "Nipah virus (NiV), a bat borne pathogen, that causes lethal encephalitis in humans has recently been reported from Malaysia, Bangladesh, Singapore and India [1,2,3]. It is one among the emerging deadly zoonotic viruses and is included in the order Mononegavirales among other dreaded viruses such as Hendra, Ebola and Marburg [4]. Pteropus fruit bats are considered the natural reservoirs of the virus [5,6]. NiV was discovered in 1998 during the first reported outbreak in the Sungai Nipah, a village in Malaysia, where humans contracted NiV from pigs, the intermediate hosts of the virus [7,8]. Recurring NiV outbreaks have been reported annually in different parts of Bangladesh from 2001, where the infection occurred due to the consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with saliva and excreta of the bats. In India, the first outbreak occurred in Siliguri, West Bengal in 2001 with mostly nosocomial or person-to-person close contact, and in 2007, a repeated outbreak was reported in Nadia in West Bengal [7,9]. Recently, in 2018, a NiV outbreak was recorded in the Kozhikode district of Kerala, a South Indian state where the index patient was reported to have contracted NiV from fruit-eating bats. However, no clinical or statistical evidence was available to prove the incidence, though the spread was mostly through nosocomial infection. All the outbreaks have recorded high rates of fatality including the 91% mortality rate during the recent Kerala outbreak [10].",

Ecological, environmental and anthropogenic factors might contribute intensively to the recent zoonotic outbreaks of NiV [12,13]. Anthropogenic factors have led to an emergence of viral diseases by creating a drastic imbalance in the ecosystem and the environment. Climate change, depleting resources, deforestation and changes in natural terrains, farming and industrialization are also significant factors which result in the outbreaks of viral diseases. In this context, we describe the epidemiological background of the earlier NiV outbreak, the mode of transmission, preventive and control measures and the factors that may have contributed to the outbreak.

They feed on fruits and nectar and are found predominantly in areas around farms and orchards, limiting the barrier of spillover of the viruses [5]. The bats are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, East Africa, Australian continents and some oceanic islands and are proved to be associated with the NiV outbreaks reported in different parts of the world (Figure 2) [5,6]. Being the natural hosts for NiV, bats are symptomless carriers but they shed the viruses in their saliva, urine, semen and excreta [6,19]. A few fruit bat populations in Cambodia [20], Thailand [21], Madagascar [22] and Ghana [23] have been found positive for NiV-neutralizing antibodies during the serological surveillance studies. The route of transmission occurs via contact with excretions or secretions of infected animals, ingestion of fruit contaminated with NiV or close contact with infected human bodily fluids [24,25].",

In Kerala, the index patient, the first infected individual of the community is believed to have contracted NiV from infected fruit bats, though this information is not substantiated (Figure 3C). All other patients contracted the disease through nosocomial transmission and hence person-to-person transmission frequency was high in Kerala and similar to the rates in West Bengal and Bangladesh [10,32].",

The second outbreak occurred in the state of Negri Sembilan at the end of December 1998. During this period, a similar and third outbreak was reported in the nearby areas of Bukit Pelandok [8,33,34]. In the beginning, the causative agent for the outbreaks was mistaken to be Japanese encephalitis virus and hence preventive measures like immunizations for Japanese encephalitis virus and mosquito-controlling were undertaken to contain the outbreaks [33]. Despite all the control measures, new cases were still on the rise and many pigs died with severe respiratory difficulties which ruled out the possibility of a Japanese encephalitis virus infection [35]. By March 1999, scientists confirmed the presence of a novel virus, Nipah [36,37]. Close contact with NiV-infected pigs was recognized to be the source of infection ensuring transmission to humans. NiV was contained by May 1999, by then 105 deaths occurred from a total of 265 cases with 39.6% mortality [38].",

The index patient was moved to a strict isolation facility and keenly monitored, while the contact cases were advised to stay indoors and there was immediate reporting in case of any possible symptoms. As a precaution, monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of NiV were arranged from Australia in order to restrain any possible sporadic outbreak.

The major clinical presenting features of NiV include acute encephalitis with fever, head ache, vomiting and respiratory discomfort. Some patients also developed pneumonia, behavioral changes, disorientations with uncontrolled gait and low levels of consciousness [1,33,47]. During the Kerala outbreak, fever, myalgia, respiratory difficulties, headache, vomiting, cough, altered sensorium and encephalitis with seizures were reported in infected persons. Outbreaks in Bangladesh and India showed a higher number of cases with respiratory distresses [48].",

Clinical reports have uncovered several differences between NiV-M and NiV-B outbreaks. NiV-B has a shorter incubation period compared to NiV-M [40,46]. The majority of NiV-B cases had respiratory symptoms as well as lethal encephalitis while NiV-M predominantly caused encephalitis with few signs of respiratory diseases [1,2,51]. In addition, NiV-B infection resulted in a higher mortality rate compared to NiV-M. This difference could be attributed to inadequate regional medical care [32,52].

Animal models of hamsters, ferrets and African green monkeys have been used to study the infection dynamics and disease patterns caused by both strains [32,53,54,55]. Comparing NiV-M and NiV-B infections in hamsters, NiV-M showed rapid disease pathogenesis and cytopathic effects whereas disease progression, immune response and viral replication was delayed in NiV-B infected animals. NiV-M was also found to be more pathogenic during in vivo infections of hamsters [53]. Moreover, researchers developed a foodborne transmission hamster model with the NiV-B strain which could successfully reproduce the outbreak scenario of Bangladesh [54]. However, both strains presented comparable respiratory tract lesions in hamsters, suggesting that there are no intrinsic alterations between both the strains reported during the human outbreaks [55]. Notably, these results showed an increased disease progression and fatality rates in NiV-M-infected models, contrasting to the NiV-B infections in human outbreaks. The ferret model revealed a similar pathological presentation and disease upon NiV-M and NiV-B infections. However, the NiV-M-infected ferrets\u2019 blood measured a higher viral load while a higher rate of virus shredding was observed in the oral secretions of NiV-B-infected ferrets suggesting a valid reason for the high person-to-person transmission rates in NiV-B outbreaks [32], although hamster and ferret models developed disease on NiV infection but varied in pathophysiology from human outbreaks.

Drought in the regions could reflect in a reduced availability of natural fruit forcing the bats to resort to fruiting trees in gardens and orchards existing in dense human habitats.
