Casinos must be subject to effective supervision and rules to prevent money laundering (Recommendation No. 28). Countries should establish the means for conducting freezing and seizure operations, even when the commission of the predicate crime may have occurred in another jurisdiction (country), and implement specialized multidisciplinary groups or task forces (Recommendation No. 30). Authorities should adopt investigative techniques such as undercover operations, electronic surveillance, access to computer systems, and controlled delivery (Recommendation No. 31). The physical transportation of currency should be restricted or banned (Recommendation No. 32). Proportionate and dissuasive sanctions should be available for natural and legal persons (Recommendation No. 35). There should be international legal cooperation, pursuant to the Vienna Convention (international traffic, 1988), Palermo Convention (transnational organized crime, 2000) and M\u00e9rida (corruption, 2003) (Recommendation No. 36). Countries should provide mutual assistance to facilitate a quick, constructive and effective solution (Recommendation No. 37), including the freezing and seizure of accounts, even with no prior conviction (Recommendation No. 38). Countries should quickly execute extradition requests (Recommendation No. 39), and spontaneously take action to combat predicate crimes, money laundering, and terrorism financing (Recommendation No. 40).",
