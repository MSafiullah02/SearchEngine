Through recording primary peritoneal macrophages, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and TPC1/TPC2-overexpressing HEK293 cells, the authors demonstrated endolysosomal ATP-sensitive Na+ currents to be attributable to activity of TPC1 and TPC2, but not TRPML1 (TRPML1 and mTOR are discussed in Section 1.3) [33]. Ogunbayo et al. [21] recently demonstrated mTORC1 to not only regulate lysosomal Na+ release, but also TPC2/NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release both in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and stably expressing HEK293 cells [21]. Indeed, rapamycin elicited similar Ca2+ signals as NAADP in wild-type PASMCs through lysosomal Ca2+ release, while neither NAADP nor rapamycin evoked similar signals in Tpc2\n\u2212/\u2212 PAMSCs [21]. While TPC2 sensitivity to ATP requires mTORC1 kinase activity, the mTOR target site on TPC2 remains uncharacterised. Recently however, a widely distributed human TPC2 gain-of-function polymorphism (G734E) was linked to decreased ATP sensitivity [34]. This could provide a stepping stone to further elucidate the exact mechanism of mTORC1-dependent TPC regulation.",

            "text": "Li et al. [35] discovered a role of TRPML1 in lysosomal positioning and trafficking: Performing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) with the late endosomal (LE)/lysosomal (LY) marker LAMP1, the authors found an equivalence of Ca2+-dependent retrograde (periphery to perinucleus) and anterograde (perinucleus to periphery) LE/LY trafficking under resting conditions, shifting towards retrograde trafficking upon brief starvation [35]. Pharmacological TRPML activation enhanced retrograde LE/LY migration and perinuclear LE/LY accumulation, which was conversely suppressed by TRPML inhibition [35]. Overexpression of TRPML1, but not other TRPML isoforms, favoured peripheral LE/LY accumulation [35,36]. TRPML1 had previously been shown to interact Ca2+-dependently with ALG-2 (PDCD6) [36]. ALG-2 acts as a cytosolic penta-EF-hand Ca2+ sensor, permitting scaffolding upon binding Ca2+. Considering TRPML1 might regulate motility upon ALG-2 recruitment, ALG-2 overexpression was demonstrated to facilitate perinuclear LE/LY accumulation, while Ca2+-binding-deficient ALG-2 showed no effect on LE/LY distribution [35]. Consolidating the relevance of the TRPML1:ALG-2 interaction, both TRPML antagonism and TRPML1 knockout cells overexpressing ALG2-interaction-deficient TRPML1 showed abrogated ALG-2-induced perinuclear LE/LY accumulation [35]. Similarly, ALG-2 knockout cells were irresponsive to starvation- and TRPML activation-induced LE/LY retrograde trafficking [35]. LE/LY motility was demonstrated to depend on dynein motor proteins: Dynamitin \u2013 a constituent of the dynein cofactor complex \u2013 was co-immunoprecipitated with ALG-2 [35]. Dominant negative (DN) dynein expression and antagonism (ciliobrevin D) abrogated starvation- and TRPML1-induced LE/LY perinuclear redistribution [35]. The authors reasoned TRPML1 Ca2+ release in response to acute starvation raises perilysosomal [Ca2+], facilitating lysosomal recruitment of the ALG-2:dynactin:dynein motor complex, culminating in retrograde lysosomal movement [35].",

            "text": "Alike the TPCs, TRPML1 has been implicated in mTOR nutrient sensing. Acute pharmacological mTORC1 inhibition alleviates TRPML1 S51, S572, and S576 phosphorylation, phosphorylation of the latter two inhibiting TRPML1-mediated Ca2+ release [37]. Unlike TPCs however, TRPML1 currents on isolated endolysosomes are unaffected by ATP [33]. Lysosomal proteins, such as the v-type H+ ATPase, interact with mTOR under certain conditions, which could also be the case for TRPML1 [33]. As previously discussed (Section 1.2), TRPML1 interactions with the lysosomal motility complex appears driven by TRPML1-dependent Ca2+ release and ALG-2 scaffolding. Upon characterising TRPML1-dependent lysosomal ALG-2 recruitment, TRPML1 was shown to interact with Sec13\nvia ALG-2 [36]. Beyond facilitating Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-Golgi trafficking, Sec13 is a constituent of the GTPase-activating proteins towards Rags 2 (GATOR2) complex, a mTOR activator [38]. TRPML1 could thus potentially activate mTORC1 via ALG-2-dependent GATOR2 recruitment. In fact, TRPML1 has already been shown to induce mTOR activity, where TRPML1-mediated Ca2+ release activates mTORC1 via calmodulin (CaM) [39]. Furthermore, the possibility of mTOR-dependent TRPML1 regulation cannot be entirely discarded based on endolysosomal patch clamp data, as this regulation could require cytoplasmic factors eliminated upon endolysosomal isolation. Onyenwoke et al. [37] proposed mTOR regulation of TRPML1 could be mediated by a downstream kinase of mTOR such as S6K [37]. It is therefore of interest that the previously postulated mTOR phosphorylation motif on TRPML1, formed by S572 and S576 (CGRDPSEEHS), conforms better with the S6K target motif (RxR[T/R]xSx[S/T]xS) than with the mTOR-associated motif (xx[P/S][G/F]SPP[P/A][P/L]) [40,41].",

            "text": "While direct mTOR regulation of TRPML1 is debated, it is accepted that mTOR regulates TRPML1 transcription. Long-term mTOR inhibition induces endolysosomal TRPML1 currents in a manner dependent on de novo protein synthesis [42]. The transcription factor for lysosomal biogenesis, TFEB [43], appears responsible for starvation-induced TRPML1 transcription. Reciprocally, TRPML1 activates TFEB via Ca2+ release, activating the Calcineurin (PP2B) to dephosphosphorylate TFEB, permitting its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. Thereby, TRPML1 and TFEB form a positive feedback loop favouring lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy [44]. Additionally, a negative feedback loop appears evident, where sustained TRPML1 activity can suppress its own activity through Ca2+-dependent mTORC1 activation. The latter would prove crucial following starvation, where sustained TRPML1-induced Ca2+ release would reactivate mTOR, in turn suppressing excessive autophagy. The possible involvement of TRPML1-dependent lysosomal GATOR2 recruitment in this scenario remains to be validated.",

            "text": "The connection between TRPML1 and mTOR appears further relevant given the molecular functions of both converging at the cAMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA). The interaction between Ca2+ signalling, PKA and mTOR signalling has been postulated by several groups, where PKA phosphorylates Akt/PKB, which in turn activates mTOR [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49]]. In this context it is interesting to note that Vergarajauregui et al. [50] identified two PKA consensus motifs in the C-terminal tail of TRPML1, containing S557 and S559. The authors found PKA inhibition by H89 potently blocked phosphorylation of S557/S559, while adenylyl cyclase activation by forskolin causing cAMP generation increased wild-type TRPML1 phosphorylation, together suggesting PKA activity at TRPML1 S557 and S559. They also found that PKA-mediated phosphorylation inhibits TRPML1 activity [50]. The positive correlation between PKA and mTOR activity alongside negative correlations between PKA/mTOR activity and TRPML1 further consolidates the integration of TRPML1 within the PKA and mTOR signalling network.",

Publications containing interaction datasets were obtained by search engines Google Scholar, BioGRID 3.4 [52], and EMBL-EBI IntAct [53]. In silico interaction partner predictions were excluded from acquired data. Interaction partner identities were translated into Homo sapiens gene names, taking HGNC HUGO Homo sapiens standardised gene notation into consideration [54]. Sources of identified interactors are referenced where appropriate and in Supplementary Table 3. The analysis worksheet of mutual interaction partners is accessible in Supplementary Table 4. For visualisation of interaction networks, Cytoscape 3.6.1 [55] was employed alongside the following Cytoscape plug-in applications: For grouping by EBI GO biological processes gene ontology terms, ClueGO was employed, loading marker lists for Homo sapiens and applying GO term fusion (GO Biological Process EBI, release 20.11.2017) [[56], [57], [58]]. CluePedia was used to visualise interactions between channel interactors, loading marker lists for Homo sapiens, and visualising protein-level interactions (activation, binding, catalysis, inhibition, post-translational modifications, and reactions) [59]. Lone proteins were removed from obtained interaction networks. The TRPML2 interactome could not be visualised due to the limited number of TRPML2 partners identified, but the interactor list is available in Supplementary Table 3. CluePedia interaction networks were overlaid with gene ontology/protein family terms as identified by GeneCards [60], and disease relevance as identified by MalaCards [60,61].",

            "text": "To date, every TPC-centred proteomic publication has reported TPC1/2:SNAP/SNARE interactions (Table 2\n) [12,13,66]. The SNARE complex mediates membrane fusion through interactions between different SNAREs on the target membrane (t-SNARE) and on the fusing vesicle (v-SNARE). Originally classified as t- and v-SNAREs, SNARE proteins are now being classified as Q- (Qa, Qb, and Qc) and R-SNAREs [68,69]. SNAP/SNARE-mediated membrane fusion events have been thoroughly described in the context of synaptic vesicle fusion with the PM [70]. While synaptic SNAP/SNARE-mediated vesicle release is accepted to be Ca2+-induced through synaptotagmin/complexin interactions [70], the relevance of vesicular Ca2+ release in regulating ubiquitous SNAP/SNARE complexes is only starting to gain appreciation. The ubiquitous, Ca2+-regulated Synaptotagmin VII (SYT7), e-Synaptotagmins and Ferlins have all been proposed to link vesicular Ca2+ release to endosomal fusion events, although no members of these families have been found to interact with the TPCs [71]. In contrast, a wide range of Annexins, representing a family of Ca2+-activated membrane-binding proteins, have been identified as TPC-interactors (ANXA1\u20137), albeit lacking validation [13]. EE fusion depends on ANXA1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner, while ANXA2 has been demonstrated to Ca2+-dependently interact with SNAP23, another TPC2-associated SNARE (Table 2) [13,72]. ANXA5 and ANXA6 mediate fusion of autophagosomes/LY and LE/LY, respectively [73]. Other Annexins have been implicated in vesicular membrane trafficking, highlighting them as potential candidates to bridge TPC function and associated SNARE complex activity [[72], [73], [74]]. ANKRD27, a regulator of SNARE- and Rab-dependent melanosome enzyme trafficking is also a TPC2 interaction candidate [67]. In short, both TPC isoforms interact with an extensive repertoire of proteins orchestrating intracellular membrane dynamics, but the mechanistic relevance of such interactions remain to be elucidated. The observed, consistent, and validated interactions of TPCs with endosomal membrane trafficking proteins also appear functionally relevant: Castonguay et al. [66] demonstrated TPC1\u2212/\u2212 cells, but not TPC2\u2212/\u2212 cells, exhibit impaired bacterial toxin trafficking through EE/RE [66]. Similarly, Grimm et al. [12] found TPC2 to be necessary for endosomal trafficking of LDL and EGF/EGFR, TPC2\u2212/\u2212 causing accumulation of EGF in Rab7+/LAMP1+ vesicles (LE/LY) [12]. The importance of TPCs in vesicular trafficking is further emphasised by the apparent dependence of particular viruses on channel activity for viral uptake and infectivity. TPC inhibition prevents infectivity of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus strains (VSV) bearing filovirus glycoproteins (Ebola and Marburgvirus), but not VSV, Lassa virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, nor Rabies virus [29]. Recently, the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus was also shown to depend on TPC1, TPC2, and NAADP signalling for endosomal trafficking and infectivity [75,76]. It remains unclear which other viruses may require TPC for uptake and transport, and which are TPC-independent (for instance, candidates from virus families Arenaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Togaviridae were shown not to) [29]. All in all, the potential to interfere with virus uptake through modulating TPC1/2-associated endosome functions appears evident, although the exact mechanism of viral entry and trafficking interference, alongside the particular pathogen targets of such interventions, require further characterisation.",

Both terms include the cardiac Ca2+-transporting, sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) ATP2A2 [63], the desmosomal, Ca2+-regulated, cadherin-like DSG2 [63], and the Ca2+-inactivated Na+\nV subunit SCN5A [63]. The former term also includes the gap junction protein GJA1, the myosin components MYL6 and MYL6B, and the sarcomere microfilament-connecting TTN, while the latter term includes the nAChR subunit CHRNB2 [63], and the myosin-binding, sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane-anchored protein SLMAP [63]. An in silico interaction screen further demonstrates the tight interaction between the TRPML1-interacting sarcomere constituents MYL6, MYL6B, and TTN, while a slightly weaker, yet functional, interaction appears between GJA1 and the voltage-gated cation channel subunits KCNG2, SCN5A, and SCN10A (Fig. 3). Neither of these interactions have been validated, nor further investigated in the context of TRPML1. It should also be emphasised the cardiac interaction network is constituted by data from a single publication, using mouse Trpml1 as bait in either murine RAW264.7 macrophages, or against a mouse heart cDNA library in a split ubiquitin Y2H assay (Supplementary Table 3) [63]. TRPML1 is highly expressed in the heart [77], yet little data exists on its importance in cardiac muscle. Mutations of TRPML1 causes the rare neurodegenerative disease mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), marked by neurological, ophthalmological, and gastric manifestations, but no discernible cardiac phenotype [2]. The existence of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)/LY microdomains were however recently described in cardiomyocytes, placing TRPML1 in tight association with the cardiac contractile machinery [78]. However, until now TRPML1 has not been recognised for specifically vascular or cardiac functions [79].",

Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) appears impaired in MLIV (TRPML1\u2212/\u2212) fibroblasts, a possible consequence of downregulated LAMP2 (the lysosomal degradation-marked protein translocator) [80]. Overexpression of the HSP70-constituent hspA1L in TRPML knockout Drosophila neurons (trpml\n1) rescues lethality and fly motility, suggesting functional relevance to TRPML1/chaperone interactions [81]. Several CMA proteins co-immunoprecipitate with TRPML1 (Hsp40, Hsc70, Hsc90 and Hop), two of these (HSP40 and HSC70) interacting with the luminal TRPML1 ECL1 [80]. The classical perception of chaperones situates them in the cytosol, shuttling degradation-targeted peptides towards the lysosome. However, HSC70 also functions intralumenally in degradative pathways, \u2018pulling\u2019 proteins across the lysosomal membrane, explaining its association with luminal TRPML1 domains [82]. Venugopal et al. [80] noted the TRPML1:HSC70 interaction to be Ca2+-dependent, where cytosolic [Ca2+] facilitates lysosomal HSC70 translocation [80]. Given reported roles of TRPML1 in nutrient sensing and adaptation to starvation [37,39,44] and an apparent reliance of chaperone function on TRPML1 [80,81], a functional relationship between the channel and CMA appears evident. As a lysosomal Ca2+ efflux channel, TRPML1 activity upon starvation could liberate Ca2+ necessary for lysosomal HSC70 recruitment [80], enhancing CMA and shifting metabolism from an anabolic towards a catabolic, nutrient-liberating state.",

As previously discussed, ER stress activates an UPR cascade which ultimately inhibits Golgi-ER retrograde transport while promoting PM translocation of HSPA5 (another putative interaction partner of TRPML1) [83]. PM-resident HSPA5 binds CD109, complexing TGF-\u03b21 in calveolae to abrogate TGF signalling, and promoting proliferation [83]. Along similar lines, the observed interaction of FBN1 and TRPML1 is of interest, as FBN1 constitutes a versatile regulator of TGF-\u03b21 signalling (full-length FBN1 sequesters TGF-\u03b21 in microfibrils to prevent TGF signalling, while FBN1 fragments dissociate sequestered TGF-\u03b21 to facilitate TGF signalling) [84]. While it was initially noted that trpml\n1\nDrosophila larvae show impaired synapse integrity reminiscent of a Drosophila mutant exhibiting impaired TGF-\u03b2 regulation and synaptic recycling [81,85], the phenotype was later attributed to altered mTORC1/JNK signalling [85]. The possible interplay between TRPML1 activity and TGF-\u03b21 signalling remains unexplored.",

TRPML3 activity is suppressed in acidic environments such as the LE/LY: In the presence of intraluminal [Na+], H+ exerts an irreversible inhibition, while in environments of lower [Na+], H+ inhibition becomes reversible [87]. Thus, v-type H+ ATPase activity is inversely correlated with TRPML3 activity. Functionally, this entails lysosomal TRPML3 being inactive in the acidified, Na+-rich lumen, whereas disruption of electrochemical membrane gradients decreasing intraluminal [H+] and [Na+] leads to TRPML3 activation and lysosomal exocytosis [86,88]. On the other hand, in an environment of low [H+] and high [Na+] such as the EE lumen, TRPML3 would be unaffected by Na+/K+ ATPase-mediated Na+ influx. Instead, the Na+/K+ ATPase would maintain an interior-positive membrane potential, opposing v-type H+ ATPase acidification [89] and sustaining TRPML3 activity. TRPML3 conversely appears to regulate endosomal pH: Wild-type [6], as well as dominant negative (DN) TRPML3 (DD458/459KK) overexpression and knockdown [90] are all found to increase the pH of endosomes. How this is mechanistically possible that both TRPML3 overexpression and knockdown disrupt endosomal pH remains unclear, but a tight control of TRPML3 expression may be critical. Evidently, a thorough validation of the above mentioned potential ATPase interaction partners is needed, alongside an investigation of the effects these may have on TRPML3 function or vice versa.",

Both PDGF- and IL7-signalling-associated proteins include the non-receptor tyrosine kinase (non-RTK) proto-oncogene FYN.* TRPML3 also associates with the non-RTK proto-oncogenes YES1,* SRC,* and LCK,* where the two former mediate PDGF response and the latter IL7 signalling. Again, neither of these interactions have been validated. However, while TRPML3 expression has not been directly linked to non-RTK activity, it has been implicated in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling: The RTK EGFR is upon binding EGF internalised into EE where luminal acidification dissociates bound EGF. EGF shuttles to the lysosome for degradation, while the EGFR is either recycled or degraded [5]. TRPML3 overexpression has been shown to decrease intracellular EGF/EGFR accumulation and degradation, leading the authors to claim TRPML3 counteracts endocytosis [5]. Martina, Lelouvier and Puertollano [6] disputed this, arguing TRPML3 overexpression diminishes EGFR degradation through preventing its lysosomal delivery [6]. Nonetheless, the two groups consented TRPML3 regulates EGFR transit through the endosomal system [5,6]. The involvement of TRPML3 in RTK trafficking makes the association of TRPML3 with non-RTKs particularly interesting, as these often act downstream of RTK signalling. For example, the TRPML3-associated non-RTKs SRC and FYN promote EGF/EGFR endocytosis [91]. SRC furthermore enhances EGFR transit from EE to LE [92], contrasting the apparent TRPML3-induced EGFR retention from later endosomes, raising the question of whether non-RTKs mediate receptor trafficking through modulating TRPML3 activity.",

FYN and LCK are better described in the context of T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling, and could in theory serve similar functions upon IL7 signalling: TCR-activated LCK recruits intracellular FYN and lipid rafts, culminating in outcomes such as thymocyte development, T-cell survival, or antigen recognition [97]. TRPML3 appears upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, and downregulated in erythroleukemia and platelets of cancer patients [95]. The potential implications of TRPML3 in immunological and oncogenic signalling pathways may be of particular relevance here.",

            "text": "Recent technological advancements have permitted the biophysical characterisation of proteins residing on intracellular membranes and the proteins they interact with (their interactomes, or \u2018contexts\u2019). In an effort to further characterize mucolipins (TRPMLs) and two-pore channels (TPCs), this review has 1) summarized their established interactions and the relevance of these, 2) compared consistencies and contrasted differences between interaction signatures of each channel, and 3) outlined interactions of apparent functional relevance, which should be investigated further. The TPCs share several functionally comparable interaction partners mediating intracellular membrane trafficking, while the TRPMLs show more defined, isoform-specific interactions. Common for all endolysosomal cation channels investigated, is their numerous interactions with proteins implicated in diseases affecting all body systems (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Several of these diseases currently lack treatment options, such as TRPML1 and TPCs interacting with the cystic fibrosis-associated VDAC1, or TRPML3 interacting with four proto-oncogenic non-RTKs. It should however be stressed that several of the described interactors lack validation following their initial proteomic identification. Similarly, further investigations of described interactors must be carried out before drawing final conclusions of their importance in a TPC/TRPML-associated context. Taken together, this review underscores the potential held by TPC/TRPML as future therapeutic targets to treat currently incurable diseases, while identifying approaches necessary to elucidate the multifaceted roles of these endolysosomal, non-selective cation channels [12,[22], [23], [24], [25],[29], [30], [31]].",
