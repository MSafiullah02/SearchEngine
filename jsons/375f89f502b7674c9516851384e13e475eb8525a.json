            "text": "Information regarding the characteristics and prognosis of this infection in patients with IBD is lacking 4 , but the impact of the outbreak and the current restrictions implemented in daily life and healthcare facilities may be crucial for this subset of patients 5 . Data from recent case series have reported no increased risk for COVID-19 in patients with a previous diagnosis of IBD in China and Italy 6, 7 . Therefore, previous data did not support that medical therapy with immunomodulators or biologics increases the risk of this infection. There are multiple aspects that should be considered regarding the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the gastrointestinal tract, as it can be detected in fecal samples in 55% of patients with COVID-19 8 . There are still several questions that remain open about this observation, like the potential infectious risk of fecal samples and the need for routine assessment of viral clearance in the stool. Moreover, the management of patients with IBD can be complex due to the presence of gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 and the potential risk of reactivation of Crohn's disease or UC during or after the infection. As for today, the current recommendations from the main medical societies include to maintain the same medical therapy in all patients. While this is correct for the whole IBD population, it is encouraged to perform an individualized strategy as the withdrawal of some drugs can significantly reduce the risk of infection 2 .",
