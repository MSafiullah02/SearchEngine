A bioinformatic study by Kuznetsov et al. investigated the changes in the transcriptome which occurred in the mouse lumbar spinal cord after a 30-day space flight and 7-day re-adaptation period on Earth, and reported new insights into the mechanisms underlying the hypogravity motor syndrome. In an interesting article by Tarlinton et al., analysis of peripheral monocyte gene expression found a correlation between regional changes in expression of human endogenous retrovirus W (HERV-W) and the prevalence of multiple sclerosis between different ethnic populations in Britain and the republic of Tatarstan. In a similar approach, Davidyuk et al. have investigated the relationship between the presence of Puumala orthohantavirus strains in small animals captured in the Republic of Tatarstan and Finland, and correlated the findings with the clinical features of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.",

In this study they showed that the new RNA analogue, phosphoryl guanidine oligo-2'-o-methylribonucleotide, could be efficiently taken up by intracellular microorganisms with strong antisense activity, thereby providing a new treatment strategy for tuberculosis, and potentially preventing the emergence of drugresistant strains of mycobacteria.",

Noncoding RNAs may modulate gene expression and onset and progression of disease, positioning them as new therapeutic targets for drug discovery. Miroshnichenko and Patutina, provide an overview of review one of the different approaches for regulating the function of short noncoding RNAs, particularly miRNAs. The latter are viable targets for anticancer therapeutic, given that miRNAs play a key role in modulating a large number of signaling pathways involved with cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Anticancer therapy using antisense oligonucleotide constructs have been shown to control miRNA activity, and these include a variety of strategies such as small RNA zippers, miRNases, miRNA sponges, miRNA masks, anti-miRNA oligonucleotides, and synthetic miRNA mimics. Furthermore, small RNA zipper technology may be utilized to ablate function of endogenous siRNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs).",

            "text": "In the last few years, CRISPR-Cas systems have been introduced as a powerful mode of RNA-editing strategy, that provides an important alternative to DNA editing which can cause so called \"off-target effects\"-unwanted mutations in other parts of the genome. Filippova et al. have shown that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) in human cells can be gene edited using CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage. Over many years, RNases have been investigated as potential antitumor agents given their selectivity and toxicity against certain transformed cells. However, the mechanisms underlying their selective cytotoxic effects remain unclear, and may include controlling RNA hydrolysis products, and selective suppression of specific genes. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms requires understanding of the transcriptome of RNAase treated cells. In this regard, exogenous RNases can modify the redox potential of key proteins (e.g., NF-kB, p53) by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in tumor cells, thereby increasing the susceptibility of cancer cells to apoptotic cell death and attenuating uncontrolled division of cancer cells. In most situations, the cytotoxic efficacy of RNases is dependent on their ability to be taken up by the cancer cells. Mitkevich et al. provide an overview of the potential role of exogenous RNases in mediating the adaptive response of tumor cells which allow the latter to remain active despite changes to the micro-environment including acidic and hypoxic factors. Mironova and Vlassov describe a large number of tumorassociated intracellular RNAs and extracellular RNAs, which can be targeted by exogenous RNAases, as therapeutic strategies for treating a variety of different tumors.",

            "text": "Several articles have addressed the problem of delivering RNA-targeting therapeutics into diseased cells. In order to find an effective \"bow\" to direct the therapeutic agent to the desired cellular target, novel approaches are needed. Conjugating therapeutics with antibodies that have the ability to recognize cell-specific surface receptors can be employed to target drugs to particular cancer cells, but this technology has a number of limitations. Nanoparticle-delivery of therapeutics has emerged as an alternative approach to deliver RNA-targeting drugs. In this regard, Chernikov et al. used bioconjugation, which is the covalent binding of siRNAs with biogenic molecules (such as lipophilic proteins, aptamers, antibodies, ligands, peptides, or polymers). Bioconjugates make very good nanoparticles as they do not require a positive charge to form complexes, are less recognized by components of the immune system, and are less cytotoxic because of their small size. Markov et al. have reviewed the role of exosomes as an alternative to synthetic nanoparticles. Extracellular vesicles may be used as natural vectors for delivery of RNA and other therapeutics targeted to tumor cells, Tlymphocytes, and dendritic cells. Therefore, extracellular vesicles have the therapeutic potential to be used as novel cellfree anti-tumor vaccines providing an alternative to dendritic cell-based vaccines. Chinak et al. have shown that cellpenetrating peptides may be used to transport cargo into cells. They were able to show that non-covalently associated nucleic acids could be delivered into cancer cells in vitro using recombinant protein lactaptin.",
