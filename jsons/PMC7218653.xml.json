            "text": "Leishmania is a one of the most common forms of trypanosomiasis protozoan, which is endemic throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the globe [1]. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most frequent leishmania infection, known to induce dermal lesions that most likely produce permanent life-long scars. Now it is well known that CL infection is primarily caused by the transmitting the parasites from the female phlebotomine sandflies bite [1]. Etiology of CL infection dependents on the number of factors such as the characteristics of the parasite, type of sand-fly species, the ecological regions, current/former exposure of infection, and also on the human behavior [2, 3]. It is now well documented that the leishmania has more than 22 different species but their prevalence varies from region to region [3]. These L. species have a wide geographic distribution from South/North America to all over Middle East with a significant increase of number of patients in last few years in the countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Algeria and also in Saudi Arabia [2\u20135]. Furthermore, the distribution of L. species or CL also reported to have an association with the number of environmental factors including temperature and humidity. Moreover, the urbanization and migration have also been documented to have an association with the global diffusion of leishmania infection [1, 4]. In Saudi Arabia, despite of the several important efforts taken by the government, but CL remains to be a major heath issue of the country. Several studies have shown that the L. major and L. tropica are the principal reservoirs of this infection, as these species are distributed in almost all region of the country [5]. Reports have also shown that the phlebotomine sandflies are commonly found in the desert regions around the farms, which assumed to be one of the responsible factors for the exposure of this parasitic infection among Saudi population [5].",

            "text": "It is now well established that the proinflammatory cytokines play several crucial roles in onset of CL, which varies from the resistance or the host immune response to infection, especially tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) [6]. The role of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 was well reported in L. major as both of these cytokines are produced by T helper 1 (Th1) cells, which are synergistically activates macrophages [7]. Furthermore, an association of TNF-\u03b1or IFN-\u03b3 with the increase of tissue damage or ulceration was also reported in CL patients [8]. Moreover, the role of Th1 response against L. major infection was also demonstrated in animal model of L. major [9, 10]. Out of all studied Th1 cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were found to be critical for the initiation of preventive immunity against all studied L. species, particularly L. major [10\u201313]. TNF-\u03b1-308G/A polymorphism was well studied in several autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, the A allele of TNF\u03b1 (308G/A) was reported to have higher transcriptional activity by 6\u20137 folds as compared with the common G allele [14, 15]. Therefore, the A allele frequency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several infectious as well as autoimmune disorders [14, 15]. On the other hand, IFN-\u03b3-874 A/T polymorphism was also reported to have a genetic link with several autoimmune/inflammatory disorders through + 874 T allele carriers [16, 17]. However, it is still unclear whether TNF-\u03b1 \u2212 308 G/A or IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T polymorphisms play a role in the leishmania infection.",

With the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, the participants were recruited from the clinical units and the Qassim hospitals, KSA. All patients were recruited after thorough examination based on the patients clinical appearance, microscopic and specific PCR-based observations as described previously [18, 19]. Briefly, patients with compatible lesions (range 1\u201314) on limb, facial or skull were included. Patients were also screened by the parasitological examination of L. species infection by culture, histological and DNA based PCR examination. Exclusion criteria of the patient\u2019s selection were: (i) CL patients co-infected with other pathogen/infection; (ii) patients having history of other parasitic/viral infection; (iii) less than 18 years old; (iv) current pregnancy or lactation. Samples from normal healthy controls were also collected from the same Qassim hospitals, all selected control humans showed negative tests for all infections including CL. After thorough clinical and molecular examination, 169 adult with CL (91 males; 78 females; age 34.1 \u00b1 3.5 years) and 199 healthy subjects (106 males and 93 females, 32.8 \u00b1 7.1 years) were included in this study (Supplementary file).

The purity and quantity of DNA was measured the by absorbance ration 260/280 as described previously [21]. The genetic variants of TNF-\u03b1 308 G/A (rs1800629), and IFN-\u03b3 874 T/A (rs2430561) polymorphisms were amplified by the PCR based Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS-PCR) using the primers sequence summarized in Table 2. The ARMS-PCR for the TNF-\u03b1 \u2212 308 G/A gene polymorphism was performed two times for all subjects including patients and healthy human controls. One time the ARMS-PCR was performed by using common forward primer (5`-TCTCGGTTTCTTCTCCATCG-3`) and reverse primer represented for G genotype (5`-ATAGGTTTTGAGGGGCATGG-3) and the second PCR was performed by the same common primer with the reverse primer that represented A genotype (5`-ATAGGTTTTGAGGGGCATGA-3`). Detection at the correct size band with reverse primer G that means the homozygote genotype GG, whereas detection of the same size band when repeated with reverse primer A that means the homozygote genotype AA. If detected the correct band from the first run with G and also with the second run with A for the same patients, that means the genotype represents heterozygote GA. Similarly, the IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T gene polymorphism was validated by calculation homozygote TT or GG alleles and heterozygote TA allele. The PCR amplification was carried out using Primus HT Dual Thermal Cycler PCR (MWG AG Biotech, USA) in a 25 \u03bcl total volume containing about 100 ng of genomic DNA template, 1 \u03bcM of each primer, 1 \u00d7 Go Taq\u00ae green master mix (Promega). The initial denaturation in PCR was carried out at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 65 \u00b0C for 50 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 60s.

In one of our previous studies, we reported the prevalence of L. species among CL patients in Qassim area of Saudi Arabia [5]. Our reported data clearly pointed out that CL patients in this region were mainly infected by L. major and L. tropica [5]. It is now well established that the parasite of leishmaniasis is endemic in all over the globe and now it becomes the major public health problem [5]. In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of CL infection is on the rise and now it remains a major unsolved health problem of the country [22]. Several previous studies reported an association between the susceptibility and resistance of leishmaniasis with the number of cytokines gene polymorphisms [23\u201325], but none of the study did not show direct association of cytokines gene polymorphism with the CL infection nor with the any of the L. species and the controversial role of their SNPs with leishmaniasis remains continued [22\u201325]. The role of Th1 cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 was well studied in CL patients, as their levels were found to be higher in these patients [26, 27]. In support of these, Akhzari et al. found that the expression of these cytokines in CL lesion varies with the treatment response [27]. Furthermore, Wilhelm et al. reported that treatment of CL patients with TNF-\u03b1 improves the parasitic burden and decreased the CL lesion size [28]. Because of these important implications of these Th1 cytokines for CL patients and frequency of occurrence of CL infection in Saudi Arabia, this study was designed to investigate the gene polymorphisms of TNF-\u03b1-308 G/A and IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T in patients of CL with different L. species in central region of Saudi Arabia.",

In contract of these results, our data also showed the CL patients infected with L. tropica, showed significantly higher TNF-\u03b1-308 A versus G allele frequency. This may be due the different genetic backgrounds of Saudi populations. More specifically the frequency of TNF-\u03b1 A allele in the Saudi healthy controls was found in a range of 18.3%, which seem to be statically significant as compared with other population such as Iranian controls (12.6%), Brazilian controls (12.2%) and Venezuelan controls (7%) [23, 29].",

Our results showed that IFN-\u03b3 + 874 genotyping (TT versus AA+AT recessive) and allelic frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + 874 (T versus A) showed significant higher in CL patients infected with L. major and also similar results were obtained in total CL cases as compared with their respective control humans. These are novel findings which have not been reported before. The IFN-\u03b3 + 874 TT polymorphism was reported to be associated with the transcription of IFN-\u03b3 gene in host CL, in which T allele was found to be involved in higher production of IFN-\u03b3 [17]. In addition, the resistance role of IFN-\u03b3 as well as INF-\u03b3 874 A/T in immuno-response against leishmaniasis has also been reported in different animal models [30, 31]. All these data either directly or indirectly supported our results. Furthermore, a study by Kamali-Sarvestani et al. also supported our results by pointing out a significantly higher frequency of T allele or TT genotype of IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T polymorphism in patients infected with L. major in Iranian population [29]. In contrast of these results, Matos et al. reported no association between IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T polymorphism with the susceptibility leishmaniasis [32]. Despite of these, IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T SNP seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis by influencing the amount of cytokine released in CL patients [32]. In support of these, Al-Bushier reported an association of IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T polymorphism with the susceptibility of visceral leishmaniasis [33]. To further determine the potential of TNF-\u03b1 308 G/A and INF-\u03b3 + 874 A/T SNPs in the susceptibility of CL infection, the analysis was performed on the synergistically combined TNF-\u03b1 308 G/A and INF-\u03b3 + 874 A/T alleles. The calculated data showed strong association between the combined TNF-\u03b1-308 G/A and IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility of L. major, L. tropica and also with total studied CL patients. In short, the data demonstrated no association of TNF-\u03b1-308 gene polymorphism with the susceptibility of CL in Saudi patients. The only association was found in between A versus G allelic frequency in L. tropica. Whereas, IFN-\u03b3 + 874 A/T polymorphism was found to be associated with the susceptibility of L. major and also with the total studied CL cases. Moreover, the data from the synergistically combined high TNF-\u03b1 308/INF-\u03b3 874 alleles strongly suggested their potential role in the susceptibility of leishmania infection.",

The study demonstrated no association between the host TNF-\u03b1-308 G/A gene polymorphism and CL infection in Saudi patients. The only significant correlation was found in A versus G allelic frequency in CL patients infected by L. tropica. Interestingly, IFN-\u03b3-874 A/T polymorphism was found to be significantly correlated with the susceptibility of L. major and also in total leishmania subjects, suggesting its role in the production of IFN-\u03b3, and thus enhance immune protection. Furthermore, a notable association between the susceptibility of L. major, L. tropica or total studied CL patients with the synergistically combined high TNF-\u03b1 308/INF-\u03b3 874 alleles, strongly suggested their crucial role in the onset of CL infection among the studied Saudi population.",
