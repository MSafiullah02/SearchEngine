Over 25 years ago, researchers investigated various factors that improve one's presence on teleconferencing including how cameras are set up and positioned to ensure eye contact with other participants. 2 However, limited bandwidth can result in major shortcomings, frustration, reduced performance and less effective action planning when compared to standard face to face meetings. 3 Speaking time also increases during virtual meetings 3 and various non-verbal communication gestures that occur during face to face meetings might be difficult or impossible to convey to others thereby reducing decision making quality. 4 The authors have attended and chaired many virtual meetings in the last few weeks. Our experiences have been variable, encountering many issues supporting the findings of a 2013 study that concluded virtual technology was unlikely to replace the traditional face-to-face cancer MDT. 5 Broadband and login issues, long arduous meetings, and difficulties in agreeing outcomes that are more readily achievable in face-to-face meetings prompted review of human factors (HF) knowledge and experiences to develop suggestions to improve the virtual experience.",

It can be even more difficult to concentrate when participating in remote discussions compared to face-to-face interactions, particularly for the chair who is denied non-verbal communication clues and other committee dynamics that can help the effective running of meetings. Lack of concentration can lead to agenda items being missed, or improperly understood and discussed in a similar way to loss of situational awareness leading to potential error. 8 Furthermore, it is much harder for committee members to look out for each other or prompt the chair if they are missing something important or going off track. We recommend a minimum 10-minute break every 90 minutes, with a longer break of at least 20 minutes after three hours. Participants can remain logged or connected in to the hosting platform or dial in number. During this time, just as in clinical practice, it is important to rehydrate and eat regularly. 9 A cup of coffee and comfort break may make longer virtual meetings more enjoyable than shorter but more intense face-to-face meeting where breaks and drinks are considered unnecessary (Fig. 1) .",
