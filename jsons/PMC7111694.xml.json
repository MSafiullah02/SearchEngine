The strategy for selection of respondents in the survey was based on a 2010 survey that covered nearly all CDCs in China, and investigated PHI workforce number, IT investments, network, hardware and systems development.9 The 2010 survey showed an average of 10 informaticians in each provincial CDC, five in each prefectural CDC and four in each county CDC. Considering the lack of PHI workforce in most county CDCs, the 2012 survey was restricted to the informaticians at provincial CDCs, prefectural CDCs and county CDCs in municipalities directly under the Central Government.",

Respondents were defined as CDC staff whose work was related to PHI, including statistics, information science, computer science, engineering and IT project management. They worked in information centres in CDCs, which were departments responsible for IT technical support. The supportive scope of the information centres covered all aspects of public health, including communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, environmental hygiene, etc. The routine work of the respondents involved system design, system requirements analysis, data analysis, data mining, data sharing, and network and system maintenance. In total, 1281 respondents were selected at random (five per provincial CDC and three per prefectural CDC) based on the 2010 survey results (approximately 1800 PHI staff at provincial and prefectural CDCs). These respondents had been involved in work related to PHI in the CDCs for more than one year. The Director of the Information Centre in each CDC was responsible for the random selection of respondents. The survey was conducted through a self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was validated by human resources consultants and health professionals. It consisted of seven parts including: (1) demographic information (i.e. age, sex, education); (2) knowledge of PHI development in CDCs, including the goal of PHI development and the strategic plans for PHI in CDCs; (3) self-assessment of personal work (i.e. satisfaction with workload, fitness, salary, job role, clear job description) and CDC support (i.e. clear competency-based certification and workforce promotion pathways); (4) personnel training on PHI, including satisfaction with training content and frequency; (5) recruitment and employment of new staff; (6) work evaluation from CDC; and (7) outflow of the workforce. Online training regarding how to complete the survey was conducted before the survey. An online data collection tool [\u2018Epidemiological Dynamic Data Collection\u2019 (EDDC)] was used.10, 11 This was developed by the Chinese CDC with support from the World Health Organization (WHO). It was formerly known as Web \u2018Epidata\u201912 as it integrated most functions of Epidata and was web based, more powerful and flexible. Data quality was controlled by the EDDC system. All the logical error checks in the questionnaire were integrated into the system. Each CDC had its own username and password for the system. The system recorded each user's name and reporting date automatically after the user submitted the data. The authors followed-up each CDC to ensure an adequate response.",

In the eastern region, 34.9% of staff were hired competitively, which was significantly higher compared with the other regions (P < 0.0001). Regarding description of their current job role, 57.8% of respondents reported they had detailed information about their responsibilities, particularly in the eastern region (62.1%, P = 0.004). When asked about the type of evaluation standard that CDC used to assess their work, most respondents reported that evaluations were based on quantity (70.7%) and quality (75.6%) of work. In addition, CDCs in the eastern region were most satisfied with services (45.1%, P = 0.0005), and CDCs in the western region were most satisfied with economic benefit (11.4%, P = 0.013). Regarding outflow of the workforce, staff in CDCs in the western region were most likely to leave if a better job became available (37.7%, P = 0.0116).",

This study found that human resources for PHI in provincial and prefectural CDCs in China had already reached a certain level. The majority (92.4%) of respondents had worked in CDCs for more than three years and accumulated some experience on PHI.

Staff in the eastern region were younger, had a higher level of education, were more knowledgable about the PHI strategy, and were more satisfied with their work and training. CDCs in the eastern region had better systems in place for recruitment and attraction of the workforce. This may be attributed to disparities in regional development, such as the level of gross domestic product, local government investment, and local policy on talent development. Secondly, there was a shortage of staff with a background in PHI able to address the complexity of PHI tasks. Thirdly, the score for satisfaction with training was extremely low. Coverage, frequency and content of training need to be improved. Fourthly, there is a need for a clearly articulated occupational development path for workforce development, including education, definition of job role, promotion, assessment standard and in-job training. Components of the occupational development path should be closely linked. In this study, only 39.3% of respondents reported they had a clear occupational development path. Finally, the score for job satisfaction showed significant differences between levels of CDC, job role and educational level, which indicates that the concerns of provincial CDC staff, general staff and staff in lower positions need to be addressed.",

The medium-term strategy is to establish the PHI education, training and examination schema with support from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Education; keep close contact with the government and university, and improve the system of occupational training; and increase investment in PHI organization improvement and workforce training.
