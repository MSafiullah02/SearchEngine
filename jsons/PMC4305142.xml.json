Unfortunately, samples could not be obtained from >10% of cases (11 of 60 SCAP patients) due to an unavailability of study personnel. Finally, the relatively small sample size may affect the statistical analysis; for example, multivariate logistic regression analyses could not be calculated. Despite the limited number of study patients, this is the largest study with bronchoscopic PCR sampling of mechanically ventilated SCAP patients thus far reported.",

The use of NP swabs has also been criticized, as they may not represent actual lower respiratory findings [15, 16]. This may have been the case for 5 SCAP patients in the present study in whom virus was detected only with the use of NP swabs. In the present investigation, the recovery of viral PCR was 1.8-fold higher in lower respiratory tract specimens than in NP swabs. Rhinovirus was discovered in 31% of the SCAP patients, which is higher than has previously been reported [16, 17]. In this study, 11 of 15 (73%) of the rhinovirus findings were detected in lower respiratory tract samples. The importance of lower respiratory tract samples for viral detection was also seen during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 [26, 27]. The PCR method selected may also influence the results; a commercial PCR test would have missed 53% of the rhinovirus SCAP cases compared with our in-house test. Taken together, the systematic use of invasive respiratory sampling methods and our custom in-house virus test may explain the higher total yield of viruses in the present series compared with earlier publications involving hospitalized CAP or SCAP patients [16, 17].",

Experimental studies have shown that in cases of respiratory bacterial\u2013viral coinfections, the eradication of bacteria did not prevent fatal outcomes as a result of influenza infection [34]. On the other hand, in the present study and in a recent Korean SCAP study, the presence of viruses did not appear to affect outcomes [16]. This neutral finding has been shown among CAP patients as well [10, 18]. These findings may suggest that viral coinfection in the context of SCAP does not necessarily have any prognostic importance.
