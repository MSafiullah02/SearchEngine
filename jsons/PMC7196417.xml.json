Undoubtedly, some patients will benefit from a tracheostomy during the weaning recovery phase. A tracheostomy is an aerosol generating procedure with a significant viral spread risk. Identifying who will benefit from it and developing safety procedure protocols requires clear selection criteria[10].",
