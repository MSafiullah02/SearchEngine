A doubling time of 5.5 days (median with [4.6, 6.9] days 95% CrI) is observed. In the SEIR model this gives the basic reproduction rate R0 of 3.4 (median with [2.4, 4.8] 95% CrI). Using as input the infection fatality rate and the interval between infection and death, the number of infections in Mumbai is inferred. It is found that the ratio of the number of test positives to the total infections is 0.13% (median), implying that tests are currently finding 1 out of 750 cases of infection. After correcting for different testing rates, this result is compatible with a measurement of the ratio made recently via serological testing in the USA. From the estimates of the number of infections we infer that the first COVID-19 cases were seeded in Mumbai between late December 2019 and early February 2020. provided the doubling times remained unchanged since then. We remark on some public health implications if the rate of growth cannot be controlled in about a week. TIFR/TH/20-11",

This is due to a combination of two factors, first the availability of test kits, and second, of trained laboratory personnel to perform the tests. When the number of tests per million of population is limited, the exponential growth in infections at the beginning of an epidemic makes it impossible to estimate the prevalence of infections in any meaningful way. One aim of this paper is to establish and validate a Bayesian statistical inference procedure to make a probabilistic estimate of the infected population from the statistics of fatalities. This is done using data for Mumbai, which is one of the major COVID-19 epidemic hot spots in India.",

At the current time, it is unlikely that a patient who dies of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) will be misdiagnosed. We know that the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) tries to track, and report on, every such case, even if the diagnosis comes a few days after the fatality. Another source of systematic error in the count of fatalities may come from a part of the population with limited access to health care. This is not a trivial source of error, and corporations have to check their death records very thoroughly to make sure that no case is missed. In New York City, where the number of daily fatalities attributed to COVID-19 has been more than 100 since late March [1] the local government is wary of undercounts [2] . Similar undercounts have been reported from several European countries [3] , and a correction by 100-200% was found to be necessary. A retrospective correction in the record of fatalities is being carried out in Wuhan. Nevertheless, fatality counts may be in error by a factor 2-3, whereas testing could potentially have errors which are one or two orders of magnitude higher.",

This is the primary aim of this paper. Daily fatality counts in Mumbai are currently less than 20. This is about one part in a million of the population, and an order of magnitude below peak rates in cities of comparable size elsewhere in the world. The simplifying assumption that the epidemic is still in the stage of exponential growth is then viable. The exponential growth rate can then be reliably extracted from D(t) without using any detailed model. Detailed analysis of the data also allows validation of this assumption, as we discuss in the results section of this paper.",

Alternative estimates of I(t) would, of course, constrain these parameters. First reports of such alternative estimates are now available from other locations [5] . We find that the ratio \u03a0 = T + (t)/I(t) is small, and has been almost independent of time in Mumbai. This ratio has also been reported in [5] . It is checked that the estimate of \u03a0 made here is compatible with that, provided that the different testing rates in different countries are taken into account.",

Stochastic models would refine our understanding of the early growth process. Genomic studies of multiple samples of the virus [6] in Mumbai would be independent data which could constrain such models. MCGM releases a daily count of fatalities due to COVID-19, and performs retrospective corrections due to late receipt of test results or other post-mortem analysis. Due to this, the count of fatalities may take a few days to settle down. Changes in municipal priorities may also affect resources assigned to various tasks, resulting in systematic changes in the statistical character of data streams. Any analysis of epidemic parameters must allow for checks of such confounding factors. Other data streams, such as the municipal records of deaths, are harder to access. However, such records will need to be subjected to statistical analysis later to ascertain whether there were possible cryptic fatalities due to COVID-19. The methods used here can also be utilized to analyze the results of such an appraisal.",

First, the infection fatality rate, IFR, gives a statistical estimate of the number of infections, I, which resulted in the observed fatalities on day zero. This is simply I = D 0 /IFR. The value of IFR could change from country to country because of differing age and gender structure of populations, or due to prevailing health conditions. However, a larger source of uncertainty is in the fraction of asymptomatic cases. As a result, IFR estimates vary from over 1% [10] to under 0.5% [11] . Based on an complete sampling of a well-defined population, it has been estimated that the age and gender averaged IFR is 0.657% [4] . This is the estimate that we use here. A recent preprint [12] updates the work in [9] by correcting this value using Indian census data to obtain a value which is approximately two thirds of this. Using this number would boost our median estimates by about 50%. Since the 95% CrI are much larger, we do not incorporate this correction.",

From the PDF for D 0 , marginalized over \u03c4 , we find a median of 0.98 and [0.6, 1.3] 95% CrI. One sees in Figure 2 that there is a broad tail to the posterior PDF which allows slightly larger values of D 0 to compensate for a much slower epidemic growth. Longer time series are needed to rule this out, as will be seen later. In Scenario L, after marginalizing over D 0 , \u03c4 is found to be 9.0 days (median) with [4.8, 27 ] days 95% CrI. For D 0 it was seen that D 0 = 1.02 and [0.8, 1.2] 95% CrI. The wide difference between the 95% CrI and the 99% CrI curves in scenario L is an indication that 10% Gaussian errors in scenario L are unable to give a good description of the jitter in the time series. In view of this, scenario L is not used in subsequent analyses.",

So D 0 and I 0 in this context are estimates of the inferred number of infected cases in Mumbai on April 2. Note that this time series is almost 50% longer than the first, and therefore regulates some of the peculiarities seen earlier. The most likely model parameters in Scenario M are \u03c4 = 5.1 days, D 0 = 2.5, which implies I 0 = 44000 [5500, 960000] 95% CrI. The 95% and 99% CrI on the joint distribution of model parameters are shown in Figure 3 . Although the contours are not as distorted as in Figure 2 , they are clearly not ellipses. So the posterior PDF is distinctly non-Gaussian. After marginalizing over D 0 , we find \u03c4 is 5.6 days (median) and [ Given the range of \u03c4 quoted above, in 3 days between March 31 and April 2, one expects D 0 on May 31 to increase by a factor [1.3, 1.7] 95% CrI, and become [1.0, 2.0] 95% CrI. While this interval overlaps with that quoted above, the probability that the two estimates are statistically indistinguishable is about 3.8%. The reason for this discrepancy can be traced to a change in the surveillance policy instituted on April 2 [15] . The increased vigilance after this date must be corrected for in order to compare the two data sets. One can account for this by changing the overall normalization of the earlier data set by a factor of 1.7. This then increases the probability of agreement between the two analyses by an order of magnitude.",

Asymptomatic infections have to be counted in this. From this point of view one should see the upper ends of the bands in Figure 6 as the most optimistic scenarios for reaching this desirable end state to the epidemic.",
