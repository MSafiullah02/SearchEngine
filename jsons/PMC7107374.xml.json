Eleven of the 15 cells lines showed significantly increased mean viral loads consistently, as compared to the baseline mean viral load, by quantitative RT-PCR (Table 2). These included lower airway (A549, Calu-3, and HFL), intestinal tract (Caco-2), liver (Huh-7), kidney (HEK), neuronal (NT2), monocyte (THP-1 and U937), T lymphocyte (H9), and histiocyte (His-1) cell lines. Seven of these 11 cell lines, namely A549, Calu-3, HFL, Caco-2, Huh-7, HEK, and His-1, showed viral N protein expression by IF in addition to a high viral load (Table 3). Most of these 7 cell lines had peak N protein expression detected by IF on days 3\u20135 after infection (Figure 1). Although the Huh-7 cell line had a high mean viral load detected by quantitative RT-PCR, N protein expression detected by IF in this cell line was consistently lower than that in other cell lines with similar or even lower mean viral loads detected by quantitative RT-PCR. The viral N protein expression in the A549 cell line was less prominent than that in the other 6 cell lines, and a CPE was not observed. In the other lower airway cell lines (Calu-3 and HFL) and the HEK cell line, CPE was observed beginning on day 3 after infection. In the Caco-2, Huh-7, and His-1 cell lines, CPE was observed as early as day 1 after infection (Figure 2). The rapid onset of CPE in some of these cell lines on day 1 after infection correlated with the subsequent lowering of viral load on days 3 and 5 because most of the cells were unable to support further viral replication. Syncytia formation was prominent in human Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines. Marked shrinkage of infected Huh-7 cells, which gave the appearance of cellular aggregates, was observed on day 3 (Figure 2). Although the mean viral loads in the monocyte cell lines (THP-1 and U937), H9 cell line and NT2 cell line were statistically significantly higher than at baseline, none of these cell lines had N protein expression detected by IF or CPE. Laryngeal (Hep-2), cervical (HeLa), muscle (RD), and B lymphocyte (Raji) cell lines had the lowest mean viral load detected by quantitative RT-PCR and did not have N protein expression detected by IF or CPE. No significant difference in mean viral load was noted in monolayer cell lines after additional inoculation in serum-free medium supplemented with TPCK-treated trypsin.\n",

            "text": "CoVs are notorious for their resistance to culture by in vitro culture systems, and therefore routine viral culture service for CoVs is not available in most clinical laboratories. The isolation of the first HCoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, took many weeks and required the use of labor-intensive embryonic organ culture before subsequent adaptation to a limited number of cell lines. Even the more recently discovered HCoV-NL63 took 7\u20138 days before CPE was detected on tertiary monkey kidney cells [11, 12, 28]. HCoV-HKU1 produced significant viral load and antigen expression without CPE by 96 hours only in primary, well-differentiated polarized human airway epithelium cell line cultures generated by provision of an air-liquid interface for 4\u20136 weeks, but it still cannot be stably adapted to commonly used cell lines at this stage [29]. However, primary isolation of SARS-CoV was achieved by direct inoculation of patients\u2019 specimens into embryonic monkey kidney cell lines, such as FRhK-4 or Vero E6, which produced CPE within 5\u201314 days. Moreover, SARS-CoV was able to grow in the polarized lung cancer cell line Calu-3 (2B4), human lung stem cells, hepatocytes, and intestinal cells after at least 3 days of infection [30\u201332]. This relatively rapid onset of CPE and the susceptibility of different tissue cells to SARS-CoV might explain the unusually severe clinical manifestations seen in SARS. This novel HCoV-EMC produced CPE on day 5 after inoculation during primary isolation and on subsequent passage by as early as day 1 in human Calu-3, Caco-2, Huh-7, and His-1 cells. Infected Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells showed frequent syncytia formation, in addition to cell rounding and detachment (Figure 2). In the Caco-2 cell line, approximately 10%\u201315% of cells showed syncytia formation 24\u201330 hours after infection. Additional incubation after the initial 24\u201330 hours resulted in cell detachment, with syncytia formation being less obvious. Although multinucleated giant cells could be found during autopsy of patients with SARS, syncytia formation was not found in SARS-CoV\u2013infected cell cultures. None of the other HCoVs produced syncytia in cell lines. Furthermore, the ability of a virus to grow in cells from different host species might provide insight into its ability to cross interspecies barriers. We therefore performed a systematic study on the differential susceptibility to HCoV-EMC among 28 cell lines derived from different tissues, organs, and host species.",

            "text": "Viral replication in different cell lines, as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR, may reflect the breadth of tissue tropism of HCoV-EMC. Seventeen of the 28 cell lines supported replication of HCoV-EMC. Notably, the mean viral load in monolayer cell lines did not change significantly after additional inoculation in serum-free medium supplemented with TPCK-treated trypsin. Although many betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, have a proteolytic cleavage site between the globular head S1, for receptor binding, and the stalk S2, for membrane fusion, the corresponding cleavage site in HCoV-EMC could not be found on bioinformatics analysis. In terms of viral N protein expression and CPE, 7 of the 15 human cell lines and 5 of the 13 nonhuman cell lines had viral N protein expression detected by IF and/or CPE. Among the human cell lines, the infected lower airway cell lines (A549, Calu-3, and HFL) produced mean viral loads that were statistically significantly higher than those at the baseline, with more N protein expression detected by IF and/or CPE. Calu-3 cells, which are polarized with tight junctions, resemble the normal human pneumocytes more closely than A549 cells, owing to their greater secretion of MUC5 mucin [33], showed greater susceptibility to HCoV-EMC than A549 cells. The upper airway cell line (Hep-2) did not support the growth of this novel virus. These findings are quite expected because all 9 laboratory-confirmed cases of HCoV-EMC infection had severe acute pneumonia, but they are markedly different from those of the other non-SARS HCoVs, which have very limited cell line tropism and usually cause self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, although fatal cases of pneumonia have been occasionally reported in patients with multiple underlying illnesses and in elderly individuals [34, 35]. In the case of HCoV-229E, it infected only hepatocytes, primary embryonic lung fibroblasts, neural cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages after adaptation, not human pneumocyte cell lines [36\u201339]. HCoV-OC43 infected only the human intestinal cell line HRT18 and neural tissue cell lines after adaptation, not human pneumocyte cell lines [40]. HCoV-NL63 could only infect the human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) after adaptation [28]. Even SARS-CoV could not infect human A549 cells or human embryonic lung fibroblasts but could selectively infect subclones of Calu-3 [32] and pulmonary stem cells [30, 31, 41]. Notably, HCoV-EMC induced CPE in susceptible human cell lines as early as day 1 in the intestinal and liver cell lines and on day 3 in the lower respiratory tract cell lines. These in vitro changes occurred even faster than those induced by SARS-CoV and could partly explain the apparently more severe clinical presentations and higher fatality rate in infections caused by HCoV-EMC. Specific testing for HCoV-EMC should therefore be performed preferably in lower instead of upper respiratory tract specimens from patients with unexplained severe pneumonia, as reported in the first case of HCoV-EMC infection. Although upper respiratory tract epithelial cells did not appear to support the growth of this novel virus, this finding did not preclude the collection of upper respiratory tract specimens from those with significant epidemiologic linkage and in whom lower respiratory tract specimens could not be obtained. More virologic data on HCoV-EMC\u2013infected patients need to be collected before we know whether the current situation is similar to SARS, wherein virus was also shed in the upper respiratory tract, leading to human-to-human transmission [42].",

This clinical presentation corroborated with our laboratory finding of effective lytic infection of the HEK cell line and another human kidney cell line, 769P [43]. About 6.7% of patients with SARS developed acute renal impairment, which occurred a median duration of 20 days after the onset of symptoms [44]. Histologically, these patients had predominantly acute tubular necrosis with no evidence of glomerular pathology. The acute renal impairment was likely the combined effect of prerenal and renal factors instead of direct viral CPE. In kidneys of broiler chickens infected with avian nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus, lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis with characteristic tubular epithelial degeneration and sloughing were found [45]. The histopathologic changes in kidneys of patients infected with HCoV-EMC should be determined. If viral cytopathic changes are dominant, it might explain the much higher incidence of acute renal failure among individuals with HCoV-EMC infection. The viral load in urine specimens from HCoV-EMC\u2013infected patients should also be investigated, because acute renal failure was an important risk factor for mortality in patients with SARS and may also apply to patients with HCoV-EMC infection. Among the other human cell lines, Huh-7 and Caco-2 also showed significant lytic infection by HCoV-EMC. Interestingly, no hepatitis or enterocolitis has been reported in patients with HCoV-EMC infection so far. This is in contrast to SARS-CoV, which induced lytic infection in both the Huh-7 and Caco-2 cell lines and manifested clinically as hepatitis without liver failure in 49.4% of infected patients [46] and as watery diarrhea without enterocolitis in 48.6% [42]. However, detailed clinical information for most of the 9 cases of HCoV-EMC infection is lacking. Except for the first case, in which elevated levels of hepatic parenchymal enzymes were detected, the apparent absence of hepatitis and enterocolitis may be due to underreporting. Additional data obtained from animal experiments and human cases are needed to fully characterize the complete spectrum of disease manifestations of HCoV-EMC infection, and collection of extrapulmonary specimens such as feces, urine, and blood should be considered for specific viral testing to characterize the viral load and shedding patterns of the virus.",

This cell line would be important for further studies involving in vitro cytokine induction by HCoV-EMC, because the other immune cell lines are either ineffectively infected with this virus or are associated with suboptimal cytokine production.

In addition, we showed that HCoV-EMC could infect cells from other animal species, including civets and rabbits. The virus\u2019 broad species tropism and its close phylogenic relatedness with the bat CoVs Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 [17, 47] support the hypothesis that HCoV-EMC has emerged from animal hosts. In fact, we have previously discovered numerous CoVs not only in bats but also in other mammalian and avian species [48\u201350]. The presence of a receptor that is used by the virus and common in bats, primates, pigs, civets, rabbits, and humans might imply a broad species tropism that is unique among all the currently known HCoVs [43]. The definitive and amplifying animal hosts of HCoV-EMC should be defined to prevent further interspecies jumping among animals and humans [19, 47]. In the case of SARS-CoV, the virus was traced from humans to civets as amplifying hosts and to Chinese horseshoe bats as a natural reservoir [47]. Further studies should provide more information on the potential of HCoV-EMC to cause a SARS-like epidemic in the future [14].",
