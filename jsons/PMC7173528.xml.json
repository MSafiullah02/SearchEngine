Reversible airway narrowing is the sine qua non of asthma. Airway hyperresponsiveness is an increased sensitivity of the airways to constrictor agonists, as indicated by a smaller concentration of the agonist needed to initiate the bronchoconstrictor response; a greater reactivity of the airways, as indicated by an increased slope of the concentration-response curve; and a greater maximal response to the agonist (Woolcock et al., 1984) (\nFig. 81.1\n). Airway hyperresponsiveness is present in virtually all asthmatics with current symptoms (Crockcroft et al., 1977); however, it can be found in patients with other airway diseases (Ramsdale et al., 1985).",

Airway hyperresponsiveness is nonspecific, in that asthmatics who are hyperresponsive to one bronchoconstrictor stimulus will be hyperresponsive to others. The bronchoconstrictor mediators most often used in clinical studies are histamine or the cholinergic agonist, methacholine. The degree of airway responsiveness correlates with the severity of asthma (Crockcroft et al., 1977) and the treatment required to control symptoms (Juniper et al., 1982).",

Each of these stimuli is known to induce airway hyperresponsiveness in experimental models. Studies of the mechanisms of airway hyperresponsiveness in animal models have identified temporal associations between the presence of inflammatory cells in the airways and airway hyperresponsiveness (Holtzman et al., 1983a; Abraham et al., 1988). These studies have led to the hypothesis that activated inflammatory cells, and mediators released from these cells, are responsible for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness after inhalation of various stimuli in human subjects. Subsequently, this hypothesis was extended to suggest that persisting airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatics, not obviously related to exposure to a specific stimulus such as allergen, is a result of structural changes in the airways caused by long-standing airway inflammation.",

The pathogenesis of allergic asthma has been greatly clarified by studying the effects of inhaled allergens in mild, allergic asthmatic subjects. Inhalation of allergen by a sensitized subject in the laboratory results in an early asthmatic response; a late asthmatic response occurs in 50% to 60% of adults and 70% to 80% of children who develop early responses. A further consequence of inhaling allergen is the development of airway hyperresponsiveness, the magnitude and duration of which appear to be related to the occurrence of late asthmatic responses (Bhalla et al., 1992).",

A. suum-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation is associated with an increase in the progenitors for neutrophils (granuloyte-macrophage progenitors) in the bone marrow (Woolley et al., 1994), in response to the release of a hematopoeitic factor into the bloodstream (Inman et al., 1996). The presence of the serum factor, rather than the bone marrow's response to the factor, is what determines the subsequent increase in progenitors. Newly formed cells from the bone marrow are subsequently recruited into the airways after allergen inhalation (Wood et al., 1998). Therefore, the development of allergen inflammation is presumably determined by both the airway's ability to produce a factor to stimulate the bone marrow and the marrow's increased production of progenitors.",

Typically, both the inflammation and functional changes are transient, returning to baseline within 2 weeks of the brief exposure to allergen. There is a report of early and late bronchoconstrictor responses to allergen (Cieslewicz et al., 1999); however, direct measurements of airway or pulmonary resistance were not made. Several investigators have used brief allergen exposure to investigate the mechanisms of the ensuing airway hyperresponsiveness. Clearly, the development of both inflammatory responses and airway hyperresponsiveness is dependent on T cells (Hogan et al., 1998a) and, more specifically, CD40 ligand-mediated responses (Mehlhop et al., 2000). Sorting out which of the T-cell cytokines are involved in the response has proven difficult. Evidence has been presented that many of the TH2-type cytokines, including IL-4 (Corry et al., 1996), IL-5 (Foster et al., 1996), and IL-13 (Grunig et al., 1998), are involved to some extent in establishing allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. However, there is also strong evidence that airway hyperresponsiveness can develop in the absence of IL-4, IL-5, and airway eosinophilia (Hogan et al., 1998b). These models have also been used to demonstrate that several mediators, including interferon gamma (Yoshida et al., 2002), IL-6 (Wang et al., 2000), IL-10 (On et al., 2002), IL-12 (Kips et al., 1996), and IL-18 (Walter et al., 2001), act to prevent or reverse allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in mice. Further studies have demonstrated that conventional and experimental antiasthma drugs including corticosteroids (Leign et al., 2002), antileukotriene agents (Blain and Sirois, 2000), and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (Kung et al., 2000) can prevent allergic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in these models.",

            "text": "More recently, investigators have begun to develop models of chronic allergen challenge in mice. These studies have to some extent been successful in their aim to include aspects of airway wall remodeling, including subepithelial fibrosis, goblet cell hyperplasia, and increased smooth muscle mass, in the pathologic changes induced as a result of allergen exposure (Temelkovski et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 2001), which are similar to the changes considered to indicate airway remodeling in asthma. It is believed that inclusion of these aspects of asthmatic-type airway pathology will make these models more relevant for studying the mechanisms of airway dysfunction. These models all have demonstrated airway hyperresponsiveness in association with both acute cellular inflammation and some features of airway wall remodeling. More recently, it has further been demonstrated in a similar model of chronic allergen exposure that airway hyperresponsiveness can persist well beyond the resolution of cellular inflammation, suggesting a fundamentally different mechanism than found in models of brief allergen exposure. Such chronic models have been used to begin to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of airway wall remodeling, demonstrating a role for IL-13 (Blease et al., 2001), but not IL-4 or IL-5 (Foster et al., 2000) (\nFig. 81.2\n). Further studies will be required to explore the role of these cytokines in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness, which appears to continue beyond the resolution of airway inflammation. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that treatment with an antileukotriene agent throughout the period of chronic allergen exposure can prevent several aspects of airway wall remodeling but not the associated airway hyperresponsiveness. Whether any intervention can prevent, or more importantly reverse, the sustained airway hyperresponsiveness should be a primary aim of ongoing research with these models.",

Furthermore, exposure to influenza virus or rhinovirus can cause airway hyperresponsiveness (Empey et al., 1976; Grunberg and Sterk, 1999). Rhinovirus infections can also increase the likelihood of late allergic reactions to antigen (Lemanske et al., 1989). Respiratory viruses damage the airway epithelium and evoke the release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators that can stimulate mast cells, increase vascular permeability, attract inflammatory cells, and initiate an immune response that may have lasting consequences (Busse, 1995). The released mediators and cellular changes can lead to airway hyperresponsiveness, edema, allergic responses, and airflow obstruction (Busse, 1995; Hegele, 1997).",

However, M3 muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle are unchanged by the infection. Viral infection may decrease M2 receptor function by damaging the receptors as a result of viral neuraminidase-induced cleavage of sialic acid residues or by inducing inflammation, as suggested by the leukocyte dependency of the effect (Fryer et al., 1997).",

Neonatal rats inoculated with Sendai virus have more than 100 times as many mast cells in their lungs as their age-matched controls (Castleman et al., 1989). Mast cells become particularly concentrated in bronchiolar walls. The increased number of mast cells is first detectable at 30 days after infection and is still present at 90 days (Castleman et al., 1990). During this period the rats have methacholine hyperresponsiveness (Castleman et al., 1990). After Sendai virus infection, Brown-Norway rats have higher viral titers, less efficient viral clearance, larger increases in bronchiolar mast cells, more persistent inflammatory responses, and greater airway responsiveness than do F344 rats (Sorden and Castleman, 1995a). The increased number of mast cells results from the proliferation of mast cells, as shown by bromodeoxyuridine labeling, and from the recruitment of mast cell precursors from blood (Sorden and Castleman, 1995b).",

After intranasal inoculation with adenovirus 5, guinea pigs develop bronchiolitis that can persist for more than 6 weeks (Vitalis et al., 1996). Viral DNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction at this time in most of the animals, and viral protein can be detected by immunohistochemistry in some (Vitalis et al., 1996).

Mycoplasma pulmonis infections cause a chronic respiratory disease in rats and mice (Lindsey et al., 1971; Lindsey and Cassell, 1973). The severity of M. pulmonis disease ranges from subclinical to lethal, with genetic and environmental factors playing important roles in the outcome. The organisms are prokaryotic extracellular parasites with no cell wall that attach to the luminal plasma membrane of airway epithelial cells. The initial acute inflammatory response, in which neutrophils predominate, evolves into chronic inflammation characterized by the accumulation of mucosal lymphoid tissue, peribronchial lymphoid follicles, and enlarged hilar, mediastinal, and cervical lymph nodes. Dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes, and macrophages accumulate in the airway mucosa (Davis et al., 1982). Lymphoid tissue, which is rare or absent in the tracheal mucosa of pathogen-free rats and mice, can occupy 75% of the mucosa after M. pulmonis infection (McDonald et al., 1991). Other pathologic changes include hyperplasia of epithelial ciliated cells and goblet cells, mucous gland hypertrophy, angiogenesis, and fibrosis (McDonald et al., 1991; Schoeb et al., 1985; McIntosh et al., 1992; Cartner et al., 1995; Huang et al., 1989). These changes can result in a several-fold increase in the thickness of the airway mucosa (\nFig. 81.3\n) (McDonald et al., 1991). Lifelong inflammatory airway disease, with chronic tracheobronchitis, bronchiectasis, airway wall thickening and fibrosis, and lung consolidation, can eventually develop (McIntosh et al., 1992).",

The airway hyperresponsiveness is most marked at 1 hour after ozone inhalation, is still present 1 day later, and is back to baseline levels by 1 week (Holtzman et al., 1983b). Ozone-induced airway\nhyperresponsiveness in dogs is associated with a marked reversible neutrophil influx in the epithelium and bronchoalveolar lavage (Holtzman et al., 1983a) (\nFig. 81.4\n). The dogs responsive to ozone have an increased number of epithelial cells in the lavage 1 hour after ozone inhalation (Fabbri et al., 1984). There is a close correlation between the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness and the number of neutrophils in the epithelium (Holtzman et al., 1983a). Ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness is prevented by depleting circulating neutrophils (O'Byrne et al., 1984). These studies suggest a causal relationship between the onset of ozone-induced hyperresponsiveness and neutrophil influx into the airways. However, other investigators have been unable to attenuate the ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in dogs with cyclophosphamide-induced neutrophil depletion (Imai et al., 1990). Further evidence that the ozone-induced neutrophilia is not necessarily related to the ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness comes from the study of Li et al. (1992), who blocked the ozone-induced leukocyte migration with antileukocyte adhesion molecule (anti-Mo1) without inhibiting ozone-induced airway hyper-responsiveness.",

Methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness occurs after ozone inhalation of 1ppm for 1.5 hours, but not after inhaling 1ppm for 0.5 hours, suggesting that the ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in guinea pigs is significantly correlated with the ozone dose (the product of time and concentration). Ozone inhalation (3ppm for 1 hour) increases neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage in ovalbumin-sensitized and nonsensitized male guinea pigs (Campus et al., 1992). Furthermore, these investigators found that ozone inhalation increases the in vivo bronchoconstrictor response to both histamine and allergen. Neutrophils rapidly accumulated in the guinea pig lung interstitium after ozone inhalation and returned to near control values within 24 hours (Schultheis and Bassett, 1991). By contrast, neutrophils recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage peak at 3\u20136 hours and remain elevated for 3 days. Leukocyte depletion with cyclophosphamide in steroid-treated guinea pigs does not prevent acetylcholine airway hyperresponsiveness at 2 or 6 hours after ozone inhalation (Murlas and Ram, 1985), suggesting that airway neutrophilic infiltration is a consequence of ozone-induced mucosal injury, but is not the cause of airway hyperresponsiveness.",

Rats developed acetylcholine airway hyperresponsiveness immediately after ozone inhalation, and the airway responsiveness returned to control levels by 24 hours (Evans et al., 1988). The ozone-induced acetylcholine airway hyperresponsiveness has been suggested to result from a marked inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (Gordon et al., 1981). Inhalation of lower concentration of ozone also causes airway hyperresponsiveness, but without neutrophil influx into the tracheal mucosa or increases in vascular permeability (Mustafa et al., 1983). However, a similar study, from the same laboratory, reports that the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage is significantly increased after the same concentration of ozone (Hotchkiss et al., 1989). To investigate the importance of neutrophils in ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, Joad et al. (1993) perfused rat lungs with buffer with or without neutrophils, and with or without exposure to ozone. They concluded that perfusion of neutrophils in the absence of ozone decreased pulmonary compliance and increased pulmonary resistance, total bronchoalveolar lavage protein, lung weight, and pulmonary arterial pressure, probably as a result of increased vascular leakage. However, neutrophil perfusion alone neither changed airway responsiveness to methacholine nor damaged the airway epithelium. Yet, neutrophil perfusion did have an additive effect on the ozone-induced impairment of pulmonary function and a synergistic effect on ozone-induced airway epithelial injury.",

Ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and an associated neutrophilic airway inflammation has been described in mice (Shore et al., 2001). The airway hyperresponsiveness, but not the neutrophilic inflammation, is mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Shore et al., 2001).",

In atopic subjects, inhaling ozone at concentrations selected to produce no detectable effects on baseline lung function increases airway responsiveness to inhaled allergen in atopic asthmatics (Molfino et al., 1991). Guinea pigs challenged with ozone also have been shown to be more sensitive to inhaled allergens (Matsumura, 1970).",

Indeed, a causal link between airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness was initially demonstrated in dogs exposed to ozone. The importance of inflammatory cells and various mediators in airway hyperresponsiveness remains controversial. Differences among species may stem from differences in the experimental models and types of measurements, as well as biologic differences. Overall, much more needs to be done to fully characterize the pathophysiology of allergen-, pathogen-, and ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness.",
