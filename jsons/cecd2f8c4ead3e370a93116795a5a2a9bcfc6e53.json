It has been shown that RSV infections in infancy are associated with a T H 2-like cytokine response (see page S66 3 ) in the upper airway, whether or not the infant is atopic. 4 T H 2 cytokine patterns are known to be associated with viral immunopathology and allergic-type responses, in contrast to T H 1 cytokine patterns, which are classically associated with viral elimination. It has also been shown that levels of at least one cytokine (IL-2) are similar in upper and lower respiratory tract secretions during RSV infection, suggesting that upper respiratory tract levels can be used as an indicator of lower respiratory tract levels. 5 Interestingly, the nasal cytokine responses to rhinoviruses are of the T H 1 type, 4 as are the responses to other viruses (except RSV). This could explain the propensity for RSV to cause wheezing, but not the association between other respiratory viruses and wheezing.",

Culture is slow and insensitive. Serum IgM is a sensitive indicator of infection, but, because it persists for up to 12 months, is not specific. A single high complement fixation test (CFT) result, which detects IgG and IgM, has the same problem as IgM, while a rising CFT is specific but only 50% sensitive. The use of macrolide antibiotics should be reserved for children in whom there is a high suspicion of atypical pneumonia -they should certainly not be used routinely to treat acute asthma.",
