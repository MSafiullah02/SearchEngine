It replicates in the respiratory, urogenital and gastroenteric tracts and can cause lesions in these and other regions. As for other coronaviruses, IBV evolves via high mutation and recombination rates [1], [2], [3], [4]. Infection with one IBV protectotype generally only confers protection again that same protectotype. Other IBVs breaking through that protection are considered to have a different protectotype. Sequencing of the IBV RNA genome has shown these protectotypes roughly correlate to sequence differences between their spike surface proteins, in particular hyper-variable regions of S1 which have also been implicated in virus attachment and neutralization epitopes [5], [6], [7]. Numerous genotypes have been detected, some of which have quickly disappeared while others have caused major worldwide disease with economic relevance [8], [9], [10].",

More recently the availability of molecular diagnostics able to distinguish between genotypes has allowed those IBVs actually present on farms to be readily identified, and this has allowed the vaccine genotype to match that of any current field threat. Furthermore the technique has allowed the detection of new genotypes of which some might cause disease. Of these a proportion can become largely undetectable within a short period while others can become a dominant disease causing genotype persisting for a considerable period. Italy 02 would be a recent example of the former in most countries while 793B would be generally considered to fall into the latter category and present a threat over the longer term. This has either led to the development of new live vaccines of matching genotype or the deployment of established vaccines, sometimes in specific combination, to counter that disease threat. In general such an approach has allowed the poultry industry to control the effects of infection from both established and more recently detected IBV genotypes.",

For almost two decades 793B detection has been associated with disease and for most of that period one or more live 793B vaccines have been in use. In that time many 793B detections have been made. Currently our study as well as another study [14] following a large number of unrelated farms in Italy, has found consistent detections of 793B. However it has not been possible to know whether encountered disease has been caused by inadequately controlled 793B field viruses or persisting, and possibly unstable, vaccine viruses. This is in contrast with, for example, AMPV, another common virus affecting poultry worldwide, where the deduction of genetic vaccine markers has shown that live vaccine derived virus can persist on farms and cause disease [15], [16], [17], [18]. While it should be possible to similarly identify markers for IBV vaccines, this has not to date been reported, probably due to the unavailability of the IBV vaccine progenitor viruses needed in the critical vaccine-progenitor sequence comparisons.",

This conclusion rests on four pieces of evidence of ascending importance. Firstly, in the Massi study [14] where chickens were given more doses of vaccine, a greater proportion of 793B detections were made. Secondly, all 793B detections in the current study had S1 hypervariable region sequences almost identical to either of the two vaccines. Uninvolved assessment might correctly raise the possibility that many 793B field viruses have equal identity in this region, and to confuse the picture further, it would be expected that mass use of vaccines A and B for some two decades, might have led to vaccine derived detections being added to the world sequence databases as field strains. Unfortunately this sequence issue cannot be unequivocally resolved without the availability of vaccine markers. Thirdly the two vaccines differed by eight nucleotides in the tested region and all detections matched the sequence of the vaccine which had been applied. Nonetheless the main evidence arises from 793B becoming undetectable after the withdrawal of the two 793B vaccines on several hundred Italian farms. It is reasonable to conclude that 793B vaccine use is no longer required for 793B virus control at the current time on these farms.",

            "text": "The paper confirms the importance to live vaccination strategies of distinguishing genuine field viruses from applied vaccines and their derivatives. For example for in human polio, vaccination strategies have needed to consider the occurrence of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, which in turn has required the technical expertise for vaccine identification [19]. In another avian viral disease of poultry AMPV, the ability to clearly distinguish between vaccine and field virus has become practical and this would be expected to have benefits in future vaccination strategies [18]. For IBV it would be clearly undesirable to be adding millions or billions of doses of live vaccine virus to birds if, as results here suggest, they served little benefit. Furthermore the presence of unnecessary vaccine viruses, especially where multiple IBV genotypes might be involved, might be expected to drive the generation of recombinant viruses; indeed this notion has restricted certain concurrent IBV vaccination strategies in France. While to date there is no evidence of field recombinants with vaccine virus contribution causing major disease in the worldwide chicken industry, the possible mechanism is there, hence vaccine use should be ideally restricted to situations where there is a known protective benefit.",
