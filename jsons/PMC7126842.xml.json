            "text": "Influenza A viruses can cause epidemics and sometimes trigger pandemics. Changes in influenza virus antigenicity result from antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Such antigenic changes create new viral variants that may not be recognized by pre-existing antibodies (Garten et al., 2009). Any newly emerging influenza A virus subtypes pose a threat to human health and could potentially lead to significant morbidity and mortality (Lu et al., 2009). The receptors for influenza A viruses are \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid (SA) linked glycosylated oligosaccharides which are dominantly expressed on respiratory cells of avian and human species respectively. Therefore, the receptor specificity for hemagglutinin (HA) is considered an important determinant of the host range of influenza A viruses. Pigs, which express both receptors on their respiratory tract cells, have been called \u201cmixing vessels\u201d for generating new influenza viruses (Smith et al., 2009) as they are naturally susceptible to infection by both avian and human influenza A viruses (Naffakh and van der Werf, 2009). Previous studies indicated that pigs are frequently involved in interspecific transmission events and recent reports indicated that H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 influenza A viruses are endemic in swine populations worldwide (Naffakh and van der Werf, 2009, Brown, 2000, Van Reeth, 2007). In April 2009, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) was isolated from humans in Mexico and the United States (Garten et al., 2009, Fraser et al., 2009). Recent studies have shown that the infectivity of the S-OIV is more efficient and fatal than seasonal influenza viruses (Lau et al., 2009, Munster et al., 2009, Maines et al., 2009). S-OIV was identified as a reassortant strain with six gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS) from triple-reassortant influenza A viruses circulating in North American pigs. Two other gene segments (NA and M) were isolated from Eurasian swine influenza viruses. This S-OIV (serotype H1N1) is responsible for the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Up until 4 July 2010, the world health organization (WHO) reported that there were more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities with reported laboratory-confirmed cases of this S-OIV (including at least 18,311 deaths). In addition, a variety of unusual clinical symptoms have been associated with this virus compared with common seasonal influenza viruses, such as hospitalization because of severe pneumonia and respiratory failure (Munster et al., 2009). Notably, reports have indicated that the S-OIV is naturally resistant to amantadine and rimantidine, but is still susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir (van der Vries et al., 2010, Rungrotmongkol et al., 2009). Therefore, a rapid and accurate diagnostic method is needed to confirm S-OIV in suspected patients. Currently, the standard procedure for influenza A virus detection and classification entails conventional virus isolation in embryonated eggs or MDCK cells, followed by HA and neuraminidase (NA) subtyping using serological or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods (Beigel et al., 2005). The currently available antigen detection methods are based on the influenza viral nucleoprotein that is conserved in all influenza A viruses, examples include the FLU OIA TEST (Biostar), FLU A (BD Bioscience) and FLU A/B (Formosa Biomedical Tech) detection assays (He et al., 2007). When emergency control and containment of these types of S-OIVs is required, these types of rapid tests which provide results within 15 min, are widely used in clinics and hospitals.",

Experimentally, the detection limit of the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor (LSPCF-FOB) has been demonstrated to be as low as 1 pg/mL when detecting mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) interacting with anti-mouse IgG (Hsieh et al., 2007). In addition, the mechanism of fluorescence enhancements of fiber-optic biosensor with metallic nanoparticles has been studied using scattering theory (Ng and Liu, 2009). Our previous reports also demonstrated that the LSPCF-FOB is able to measure alpha-fetoprotein in human serum (Chang et al., 2009). In addition, the LSPCF-FOB has been applied to enhance the detection sensitivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in diluted serum to a lower limit of 0.1 pg/mL (Huang et al., 2009). The LSPCF-FOB offers many useful features including ease of operation and disposability. In addition, based on the ultra high detection sensitivity and quantitative ability, this biosensor can be used for the early diagnosis of diseases in clinics.",

Briefly, viral RNA was extracted using a QIAGEN Viral Amp kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), then quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed on the isolated RNA using an ABI one-step RT-PCR kit (P/N 4309169) (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and an ABI 7000 real-time PCR thermocycler. For S-OIV RNA detection, H1-specific primers and probes were used for RT-PCR amplification (SW-H1 forward: 5\u2032-GTGCTATAAACACCAGCCTYCCA-3\u2032; SW-H1 reverse: 5\u2032-CGGGATATTCCTTAATCCTGTRGC-3\u2032; SW-H1 probe: FAM-5\u2032-CAGAATA TACAXTCCRGTCACAATTGGARAA-3\u2032, where XT = BHQ1 dT). Amplification conditions for the H5 primers were 48 \u00b0C for 30 min and 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. H1N1 quantities were calculated by interpolation from a standard curve generated by the parallel running of serial dilutions of known quantities of the H1 (HA) segments of cloned plasmids.",

Glycosylated HA proteins of the S-OIV were selected as detected targets for diagnosis of S-OIV infection. The recombinant glycosylated HA (rHA) proteins were produced using the baculovirus cell based system. The trimer or monomer forms (HA0 was composed of HA1 and HA2 domains) of the rHA proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis (Supplement Fig. S2). To develop convenient and accurate assays for S-OIV detection, we first set up a conventional capture ELISA using polyclonal antibodies (a-H1) against S-OIV HA proteins. We used the rHA protein as the antigen for sensitivity evaluation in this assay. The results shown in Fig. 1\ndemonstrate a linear relationship between the O.D. 492 nm and the concentrations of rHA protein over the range 12.5\u2013800 ng/mL; the correlation coefficient (R\n2) is 0.9916 and the error bar indicates one standard deviation in the measurement.

Different dilutions of rHA proteins in PBS solution (i.e., 0 pg/mL, 5 pg/mL, 50 pg/mL, 500 pg/mL, 5 ng/mL, and 50 ng/mL) were injected into the reaction chamber to interact with captured antibodies (a-H1), and this interaction was measured by the LSPCF probes. The results shown in Fig. 2\ndemonstrated a linear relationship between the normalized fluorescence signals and rHA protein concentrations over the range 5\u201350 ng/mL; the correlation coefficient (R\n2) is 0.9375 and the error bar indicates one standard deviation in each measurement. We think the huge error bar of each measurement is caused by the injured core when the fiber was stripped off the cladding by immersion in ethyl acetate. The fluorescence signal was calculated by subtracting the background level from the steady fluorescence intensity in each measurement in which the fluorescence intensity was obtained as the measuring fluorescence normalized by laser beam intensity to reduce the perturbation of laser intensity. After that, the fluorescence signal was normalized by the background level in order to decrease the effect of misalignment in the system. According to IUPAC definition, the detection limit and analytical sensitivity of LSPCF-FOB in the experiment are estimated at 13.9 pg/mL and 3.7 pg/mL, respectively. The serial dilutions (from 10\u22121 to 10\u22125) of each of the UV-irradiated S-OIVs in PBS solution were injected into the reaction chamber to interact with the immobilized a-H1 and form an <a-H1/S-OIV> complex on the modified stripped portion of the fiber surface. The detection limit was around a 1000-fold dilution of the original S-OIV culture supernatant (8.25 \u00d7 104\n copies/mL) in PBS solution as shown in Table 2\n. Notably, the normalized fluorescence signal of the 10-fold diluted UV-irradiated avian influenza A (H5N1) virus culture supernatant was showed the same signal level with the 10-fold diluted blank medium which is the control group. To mimic in vivo isolation of influenza virus from the upper human respiratory tract, the S-OIV isolate was diluted in nasal mucosa from healthy donors (called mimic solution). A 500-fold dilution of S-OIV culture supernatant (1.65 \u00d7 105\n copies/mL) in mimic solution was successful detected by the LSPCF-FOB compared with a 10-fold diluted influenza A (H5N1) virus culture supernatant, which corresponded to the medium only control as shown in Table 2.",

To lower the detection limit and improve the analytical sensitivity of capture ELISA, an LSPCF-FOB platform was used. Our results demonstrated that the LSPCF-FOB is capable of detecting the concentration of rHA protein at pg/mL level in PBS solution and the detection limit was calculated at 13.9 pg/mL based on IUPAC definition. Therefore, the LSPCF-FOB improves the detection limit 103-fold better compared with conventional capture ELISA using the same capture antibody. A comparison of different assays for S-OIV detection is shown in Table 4\n. At present, there are two assays recommended for use in the diagnosis of S-OIV in clinical samples. The first option is a molecular diagnostic assay based on nucleic acid detection, such as real-time RT-PCR or RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR is the best choice for clinical diagnosis of S-OIV in respiratory specimens and can further differentiate between S-OIVs and seasonal influenza A viruses by using specific primers and probes. The sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR is over 97% and its detection limit is around 102\u2013103\n copies/mL (Bose et al., 2009, He et al., 2009, van der Vries et al., 2010, Guo et al., 2009, Chan et al., 2009, Wenzel et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2009). However, both assays are complex and cannot be readily performed in primary health care settings. Although the findings of this study indicate that the LSPCF-FOB is not as sensitive as real-time RT-PCR or RT-PCR, it can improve the antigen detection limit and diagnose a certain pathogen within a few hours. Whereas, the assay time using the RT-PCR system means that confirmation of S-OIV is often reported too late to be of clinical or epidemiological relevance (Chan et al., 2009, Cunha et al., 2009).",

            "text": "RIDT is another diagnostic option. RIDTs are based on immunochromatographic lateral flow tests which use monoclonal antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein of influenza virus, and can be performed in around 15 min with minimal training (Taylor et al., 2009). However, although most RIDTs can be used for distinguishing between influenza A and influenza B viruses, few can further classify influenza A subtypes. Furthermore, many studies on RIDTs report a detection limit of 106\u2013107\n copies/mL for seasonal influenza viruses and a low sensitivity (less than 50%) for S-OIV detection (Faix et al., 2009, Chan et al., 2009, Vasoo et al., 2009, Balish et al., 2009, Cunha et al., 2009, Sabetta et al., 2009, Drexler et al., 2009). Experimentally, in comparison with the conventional RIDT and Flu A/B rapid test, the LSPCF-FOB platform developed in this study increased the detection sensitivity at least 50-fold for S-OIV diagnosis in PBS solution and 25-fold in mimic solution. The low detection limit of LSPCF-FOB is based on several properties. Firstly, the LSPs excite and enhance fluorescence with high efficiency near the gold nanoparticle (GNP) surface. Secondly, the fluorescence is amplified because more than 120 fluorophores are presented on each LSPCF probe and are excited simultaneously. Thirdly, on the fluorescence probe, the protein A which is immobilized on the GNP surface, acts not only as a linker by connecting to the secondary antibody labeled fluorophore but also as a spacer that effectively avoids metal-induced quenching effects (Hsieh et al., 2007). Fourthly, the fluorescence signal is usually detected at the distal end of the optical fiber in a conventional setup. In such situations, the coaxial propagation of the pumping laser beam induces a strong background signal, which results in an apparent lower detection limit. In contrast, the LSPCF-FOB detects the fluorescence signals beside the reaction region. This results in a significant increase in the efficiency of fluorescence collection compared with the conventional setup (Chang et al., 1996). Finally, the sandwich immunoassay configuration in the LSPCF-FOB exhibits higher specificity than other types of immunoassays, such as direct labeling and single-capture (Kingsmore, 2006). We therefore propose that the LSPCF-FOB is an effective alternative to conventional methods for the clinical diagnosis of S-OIV. The LSPCF-FOB also has the potential to be developed into a high-throughput screening or detection assay for different subtypes of influenza A virus.",

Experimentally, a linear response between the normalized fluorescence signal and the concentration of rHA protein was obtained in the range of 5\u201350 ng/mL. In addition, the detection limit and analytical sensitivity of LSPCF-FOB in the experiment were calculated at 13.9 pg/mL and 3.7 pg/mL, respectively. Compared with conventional capture ELISA, the detection limit of the LSPCF-FOB for rHA protein detection is 103-fold better by using the same capture antibodies. Furthermore, compared with conventional RIDTs, the LSPCF-FOB platform enhanced the detection sensitivity of S-OIV diagnosis up to 50-fold in PBS solution and 25-fold in mimic solution. Our experimental results revealed that the LSPCF-FOB offers higher detection sensitivity and specificity for S-OIVs, using PBS or mimic solution as a diluent, compared with conventional capture ELISA or RIDTs. We propose that the LSPCF-FOB has the potential to be developed into a rapid and accurate diagnostic platform for S-OIV detection in the near future.",
