With ongoing debates for/against travel restrictions, some countries have implemented these restrictions to protect their citizens in response to the global rise in cases (2) . Conversely, in countries with many confirmed cases, it appears more people are trying to travel out of those cities, whether from panic, legitimate reasons or ignorance(1). Travel may be necessitated for planned, legitimate or emergency reasons which may include: conferences, family, work or vacation, which did not factor in the occurrence of a global outbreak. Contacts of cases may not be self-aware of the risk they portend, especially when they are not symptomatic, putting many more people at risk.",

While information regarding the outbreak is being disseminated via credible public health organizations, social media and rumors in communities during this outbreak also provide sometimes, unverified and untrue information(4). This becomes more important for low-and middle-income countries, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, who may for the first time need to issue travel advisories and provide travel health services, sometimes in cities or countries where they may have been previously non-existent. The COVID-19 outbreak has shown that travel health and medicine are vital in supporting the outbreak response, and more needs to be done in sub-Saharan Africa for capacity building and infrastructure not just for the present but in preparing for any potential outbreaks in the future. From academics to traders in the sub -region, updated, evidence -based information regarding what countries not to travel to, how to travel safely, symptoms to look out for, self-quarantine, their country embassies at the travel destination and a fair estimate of their risk if they decide to travel.",

While we may not have answers to some of these questions, it is a good starting point to inform public health actions now and in the foreseeable future in a contextually relevant manner.
