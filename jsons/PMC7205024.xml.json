            "text": "The novel fitted ophthalmic microscope drape is produced under sterile conditions within the operating theatre. A sterile cover is laid on top of a surgical trolley. The ALCON vitrectomy prepack is opened and the clear plastic cover for ALCON Constellation machine monitor is removed and unfolded on the sterile trolley. A rectangle shape measuring ~40 \u00d7 40 cm is cut out using scissors and put to one side (Fig. 1a). The next step is the preparation of the microscope drape. For this, we use a commercially available semi-transparent ophthalmic surgery drape. The drape is unfolded on the trolley and the fluid collection bag is cut away (Fig. 1b). The drape is then positioned with the adhesive square section (the part that ordinarily adheres to the patients\u2019 eye) facing up. It is this adhesive square that will be attached to the operating microscope. The previously prepared rectangle clear monitor cover cut out is positioned on top of the unfolded semi-transparent ophthalmic drape, about 10 cm below the non-stick paper edge, and is attached to it with surgical tape at each of the four sides (Fig. 1c). This section of the ophthalmic drape is then folded over and the semi-opaque drape overlying the transparent rectangle cut away with scissors. This results in a semi-transparent ophthalmic drape with a transparent window made by the monitor cover cut out, to allow direct visualisation of the surgical field. (Fig. 1d final product). The final step is to cut a cross in the adhesive square of the drape in order to adhere the drape to the microscope. The drape is then ready to fix into position once the BIOM plate has been screwed into place (Fig. 1e).",
