            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a leading cause of death among children aged less than 5 years worldwide, with an estimate of 0.921 million deaths in 2015. Indeed, CAP was second only to preterm birth complications, being the leading cause of death in countries with high under-5 mortality rate, yet important in medium high, and medium child mortality countries.1 Furthermore, CAP imposes a substantial burden on health services and is a major cause of hospital referral and admission. According to the last estimate, in 2010, roughly 265,000 deaths due to CAP took place in hospitals, 99% of them in developing countries.2 Therefore, it is possible to observe that 81% of deaths happened outside hospitals,2 particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia countries.1 In Brazil, during 2017, 1,117,779 hospital admissions occurred among children under 5 years, and the most frequent causes of admission were respiratory disease (351,763; 31.5%), perinatal complications (277,212; 23.5%), and infectious/parasitic illnesses (163,958; 14.7%).3 Regarding mortality, 2,349 deaths due to respiratory disease were registered in the same age range, in Brazil, in 2017, i.e., 0.7% of the cases hospitalized died (case fatality rate).3 These figures are in agreement with the findings of mortality and morbidity according to the economic development of the countries,1 as Brazil is an upper middle income country.4 That is, although CAP is not a frequent cause of death, it is a major cause of hospital admission in Brazil. Due to its impact on childhood morbidity and mortality, in health care assistance, it is paramount to be updated in diagnosing and treating children with CAP. Thus, this study aimed to provide cutting-edge information for the management of CAP patients under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature.",

Streptococcus pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, HMPV, rhinovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus 1, 3, and 4, and influenza virus A and B were independently associated with pneumonia and the authors speculate that increasing S. pneumoniae vaccination coverage may substantially reduce the burden of CAP among children in developing countries.14 In addition to that, another multi-center study conducted in Bangladash, Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia, all developing countries, between 2011 and 2014 (the PERCH study), 1,769 non-HIV cases with positive chest X-ray, hospitalized with severe CAP, aged 1\u201359 months, and 5,119 community controls were enrolled; detection of RSV, parainfluenza virus, HMPV, influenza virus, S. pneumoniae, Hib, H. influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens was associated with case status. The etiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 61.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.3\u201365.6) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 27.3% (23.3\u201331.6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5.9% (3.9\u20138.3). RSV had the greatest etiological fraction (31.1%, 95% CI: 28.4\u201334.2) of all pathogens.15\n",

Since the early 1990\u2019s, the WHO has recommended the use of quantitative tachypnea (age-specific elevated respiratory rates) to identify children that would require treatment with antibiotics for possible pneumonia.6 It is necessary to clarify that the WHO respiratory rate criteria were selected based on field, observational studies in target epidemiologic settings due to their high sensitivity, reasonable specificity, and ease of implementation where access to formal medical evaluation was limited. Additionally, the evidence base for establishing these criteria is prior to the introduction of vaccines against Hib and S. pneumoniae, regarded as the two major causes of CAP mortality.23 It is also necessary to emphasize that the WHO respiratory rate criteria are not a diagnostic approach; instead, it was recommended to be employed as an easy tool to identify, among children under 5 years with acute respiratory infection complaints, those who had chance to have a compromised lower respiratory tract, who could then be at risk of dying. In a recently published systematic review of the accuracy of symptoms and physical examination findings to identify cases with radiographic pneumonia among children younger than 5 years, 23 prospective cohort studies of children were included (eight from North America), among which the prevalence of radiographic pneumonia in North American studies was 19% and 37% outside of North America. The presence of moderate hypoxemia (oxygen saturation \u226496%) and increased work of breathing (grunting, flaring, and retractions) were signs most associated with pneumonia, whereas normal oxygenation (oxygen saturation >96%) decreased the likelihood of pneumonia. Curiously, tachypnea (respiratory rate >40 breaths/min) was not strongly associated with pneumonia diagnosis.24 Indeed, the limitations of respiratory rate-based pneumonia diagnosis also include overdiagnosis, due to the inclusion of cases of asthma and other respiratory ailments that compromise the lower respiratory tract.25\n",

Radiologic findings consistent with pneumonia include pulmonary infiltrate, either alveolar or interstitial; alveolar infiltrate is characterized as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or the entire lobe, or even the entire lung, which may or may not contain air-bronchogram, and interstitial infiltrate is defined as linear and patchy densities in a lacy pattern.30 Interestingly, it had been demonstrated that the sensitivity (95% CI) of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia for pneumococcal infection was 93% (80%\u201398%); conversely, the negative predictive value (95% CI) of normal chest X-ray was 92% (77%\u201398%).31 These findings were detected among hospitalized31 and non-hospitalized children.32 Thus, the findings of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia are actually predictors of bacterial pneumonia. Moreover, if the frequency of bacterial pneumonia is decreasing due to the wide implementation of the conjugate vaccines (Hib and PCVs), the accuracy of those predictors may change over time and among different settings, depending on vaccines coverage. From a practical standpoint, bacterial pneumonia should be the target as children with typical bacterial infections, alone or complicated by a viral infection, have worse outcomes than those infected with a virus alone.11\n",

Asthma was observed in 21.4%. In the multivariable analysis, viral infection (AdjOR [95% CI]: 9.6; 95% CI: 2.7\u201334.0), asthma (AdjOR [95% CI]: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.9\u201311.0), and age (AdjOR [95% CI]: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97) were independently associated with wheezing on physical examination. The positive predictive value of detected wheezing for viral infection was 96.3% (95% CI: 90.4\u201399.1%). The authors concluded that wheezing detected on physical examination is an independent predictor of viral infection.33 However, wheezing does not rule out bacterial infection. As in practice it is not only necessary to identify children with CAP, but mainly those with probable bacterial infection, it is possible that the combination of normal chest X-ray, detection of wheezing upon physical examination, and pulse oximetry may be useful for this goal. This is a potential issue for future research.",

Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have shown some value in the identification of bacterial infections34, 35 but it has not been established yet a relevant clinical cut-off point for their use.36 For instance, in an Italian randomized clinical trial, children with non-severe CAP were admitted at the hospital specifically to be included in this PCT investigation: 155 received antibiotics if the mean serum PCT upon admission was \u22650.25 ng/mL and the remaining 155 children received antibiotics based on the clinical evaluation of the attending physician. Antibiotics were prescribed to 133 children (85.8%) from the first group and 155 children (100%) from the second group, (p < 0.05). The length of antibiotics use was lower (5.37 vs. 10.96; p < 0.05) as well as the frequency of adverse events related to antibiotics use (3.9% vs. 10.96%; p < 0.05) in the group that had serum PCT measured. It is necessary to emphasize that none of the patients who did not receive antibiotics worsened or needed antibiotics afterwards.37 A Brazilian study described that serum PCT upon admission below 0.25 ng/dL had high negative predictive value for pneumococcal infection (93%; 95% CI:90\u201399%).38 It is important to highlight that, in both studies, patients had radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and, for that reason, even with a chest\u2019s radiograph that confirms CAP diagnostics, it appears to be possible to identify those children who will not benefit from antibiotic use, for example, considering the serum PCT level <0.25 ng/mL. Additionally, IL-6 was independently associated with pneumococcal infection, having a high negative predictive value among children under 5 years of age hospitalized with CAP.39 To date, there is lack of this information in non-hospitalized children in this age range. Moreover, a combination of biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, C-reactive protein, and interferon \u03bc-induced protein) was described to be useful in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in hospitalized children; however, less than 200 children were investigated.40, 41 A common pitfall in this kind of study is how children without bacterial CAP are identified. For example, in a recently published study from Australia, definite bacterial infection was described as clinical empyema and/or bacteria detected in blood or pleural effusion, while presumed viral pneumonia comprised at least one virus detected in the nasopharyngeal swab without criteria for definite bacterial pneumonia.42 In fact, by using these definitions, the authors grouped cases in two subgroups: the first with invasive bacterial infection and the second without invasive bacterial infection and possible viral infection. The great challenge in grouping CAP cases with bacterial infection is the diagnosis of non-invasive bacterial infection.43 When the methods employed do not diagnose non-invasive bacterial infection, these patients are mislabeled as cases without bacterial infection. Undoubtedly, the identification and validation of tools to reliably distinguish, among children with CAP, those with viral infection from those with bacterial infection is a priority in the childhood CAP research field.",

The difference in proportion of CAP cases that are hospitalized in developing and developed countries likely reflects a combination of physician differences in management, limited access to health care, and differences on health-care seeking behavior among parents for children, rather than less severe disease among children in developing countries.44 Furthermore, the health care system structure differs between developing and developed countries.44 In reality, no published studies from developed countries have systematically compared outcomes of children treated as outpatients with those of hospitalized children according to varying degrees of respiratory distress.48 Current recommendations from developed countries are based on the assumption that children have reasonable access to healthcare, including evaluation by a doctor.

Despite the fact that these findings were based on cases treated in hospital, and therefore it is not possible to infer which cases may have been successfully managed at home, it is possible to recognize that those were evidence-based predictors that can therefore be used in the clinical management of CAP cases across diverse settings, particularly aiding the decision about which patients should be hospitalized for treatment.",

Two different dose regimens were compared in a clinical trial conducted in Salvador, Brazil: 820 children with non-severe CAP were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin either twice or thrice a day; this was a placebo-controlled, randomized, triple-blinded clinical trial that showed equivalence on the efficacy of both regimens.57 Thus, the most comfortable and convenient dosage (50 mg/kg/day twice daily) can be used based on science evidence. It is important to recall that the key pharmacodynamics parameter for amoxicillin efficacy is length of time over the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which should be \u226540%\u201350% of the dosing interval during treatment of pneumococcal CAP.58 A pharmacokinetic study compared twice and thrice daily dosing in children receiving 50 mg/kg/day and reported that 91% of the patients had amoxicillin concentrations above 0.5 ug/mL for >50% of the dose interval and 42% had amoxicillin concentrations above 2.0 ug/L for >50% of the dose interval in the twice-daily dose arm.59 That indicates that the appropriateness of the 50 mg/kg/day dose of amoxicillin needs to be re-evaluated according to the MIC of the pneumococcal strains isolated in the region. For instance, Canadian authors have recently advised against the routine use of higher doses of amoxicillin to treat non-severe CAP cases in Canada, as only 0.6% of pneumococcal strains presented intermediate resistance (MIC = 4 ug/mL) to amoxicillin. Those authors also argued that the unjustified use of higher doses of amoxicillin leads to increases in costs, side effects, and total antibiotic exposure, and the harmful effects on the patients\u2019 microbiome should also be considered.60\n",

Three children with acute infection by C. trachomatis did not present therapeutic failure and amoxicillin was the antibiotic used through the entire treatment period. The authors concluded that it was not necessary to treat atypical bacterial infection in every child aged between 2 and 59 months with non-severe CAP; on the contrary, macrolide use could be reserved for those rare cases in which amoxicillin was not effective.22\n",

A systematic review published in 2008 evaluated the efficacy of short and long courses of the same antibiotic, in children aged 2\u201359 months with non-severe CAP, and identified two clinical trials in which three and five days of amoxicillin use were compared (one in India and another in Pakistan) and one clinical trial where three and five days of co-trimoxazole were compared (in Indonesia and Bangladesh): neither study indicated differences in the efficacy per treatment length.61 It is of utmost importance to notice that all three studies diagnosed CAP patients according with WHO diagnostics criteria: presence of tachypnea. Evidently, cases of asthma, bronchiolitis, and other lower respiratory tract diseases were included, and the CAP diagnostics was erroneously made in children with other respiratory morbidities. That is why results from studies that diagnosed CAP using WHO criteria should only be generalized for those cases diagnosed in clinical practice with the same criteria, once these results might be different in radiologically-confirmed pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia.25 In this context, the author highlights an Israeli clinical trial published in 2014: children aged 6\u201359 months, with radiological finding of alveolar infiltrate on the chest radiograph taken upon admission, temperature \u226538.5 \u00b0C, leucocyte total count \u226515.000 mm3, without dangers signs were followed-up daily. The authors first compared three days of treatment with ten days. Due to 33% rate of therapeutic failure in the first arm against none (0%) in the second arm, a preliminary interim analysis switched the duration of treatment in the first arm to five days. At the end, there were 56 and 59 cases treated either with five or ten days of amoxicillin, respectively, without any therapeutic failure. Authors concluded that five days of amoxicillin are enough to treat CAP with alveolar infiltrate, without danger signs or complications.62\n",

It is also relevant to comment on how hospitalized patients with CAP evolve during antibiotic treatment. Another Brazilian study included 154 hospitalized children older than 2 months of age with radiologically-confirmed CAP, all treated with aqueous penicillin G (200.000 UI/kg/day) and penicillin was substituted in 26 (18%) cases due to deterioration of clinical status. Among the 128 remaining cases that received aqueous penicillin G throughout the treatment period, tachypnea, fever and chest indrawing were still present after 48 h of antibiotic therapy in 51.0%, 26.8%, and 10.3% of the cases, respectively; those symptoms were present at 120 h after treatment onset in 33.3%, 10.3%, and 2.2% of the cases, respectively.65 Notably, all patients presented a full recovery and were discharged from hospital with oral amoxicillin replacing aqueous penicillin G for home completion of antimicrobial therapy. These numbers show that patients may have a slow recovery, suggesting that there is no need of antibiotic replacement if the patient does not present clinical/radiological deterioration. Therefore, the use of ceftriaxone in cases with very severe disease or the association of oxacillin or macrolide should occur in specific situations, where it is possible to assume the presence of high penicillin resistant pneumococcus, or \u03b2-lactamase producing H. influenzae (ceftriaxone indication), or Staphylococcus aureus (oxacillin indication), or even atypical bacteria (macrolide indication).54\n",

Ceftriaxone increases the risk of kernicterus in these patients, once it has high avidity to serum proteins, especially albumin, which bonds to bilirubin.70\nC. trachomatis should be suspected in the presence of conjunctivitis.

A Spanish study was performed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty children, aged from 1 month to 14 years, with CAP and pleural effusion were included. Those authors described faster recovery rate, measured objectively in hours, in the group that received dexamethasone (DXM) 0.15 mg/kg, every 6 h, for 48 h, plus cefotaxime, when compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in adverse events attributable to the study drugs, except for hyperglycemia. Therefore, the authors concluded that DXM appeared to be a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for decreasing the time to recovery in children with parapneumonic pleural effusion.71 Another study included children with severe CAP: 29 patients received a 5-day methylprednisolone course plus imipenem and 30 patients received imipenem plus placebo. The authors reported that the methylprednisolone group had a faster resolution of symptoms.72 A recent systematic review identified four randomized controlled trials that included 310 children; corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (RR 0.41 [95% CI: 0.24\u20130.70]; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure.73 To date, the role of corticosteroids in adjunctive chemical therapy of childhood CAP is yet to be established. Further support is needed to recommend the use of corticosteroids in clinical practice across distinct severity subgroups and in association with different antibiotics, especially \u03b2-lactams.54\n",

In regard to severity assessment, danger signs (inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation <90%) have been recognized as predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. The first line option for antibiotic treatment comprises oral amoxicillin for outpatients and ampicillin or aqueous penicillin G or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) for inpatients. Future investigations should prioritize the identification and validation of tools to distinguish among children with CAP those with viral infection from those with bacterial infection.",
