            "text": "Intracranial hypertension (IH) is a common clinical problem in the intensive care unit (ICU), which requires immediate and urgent treatment. IH is the result of either primary central nervous system (CNS) lesion or a complication of co-existing systemic disease. It is caused by a variety of conditions divided into five main categories based on their pathological mechanism (Table 1). Any condition affecting the CNS, defined as acute brain injury (ABI) [(e.g. traumatic brain injury (TBI)], has two components: primary brain injury that cannot be reversed and secondary brain injury (SBI). SBI is defined as any physiological event that can occur within minutes, hours, or days after the initial injury and leads to further damage of nervous tissue. It can be detected through clinical examination and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, as it is mostly due to increased ICP, and confirmed by imaging tests. Since there is a causal relationship between primary brain injury, IH, and SBI (Fig. 1), we focus on IH in this article. We conducted a literature search on MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane Library for studies completed in the last twenty years using the terms \"intracranial hypertension\" and \"ICU management\". We have also included guidelines from all established societies regarding IH in ABI [TBI, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), ischemic stroke] and its management in ICU. The aim of this review article is to provide basic knowledge updated with what's new in the literature regarding the management of patient with IH.",

The comatose patient with ABI and possible IH should be clinically evaluated using routinely either the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) (combined with assessment of pupils) or the full outline of unresponsiveness (FOUR) score, as multimodality monitoring (MMM) consensus recommend [1]. Brain herniation is a potentially fatal complication of IH. There are six types of herniation, namely the uncal transtentorial, the central transtentorial, the subfalcine, the tonsilar, the ascending transtentorial and the transcalvarial herniation (Fig. 2).",

The latest guidelines [3] recommend management of severe TBI patients using information from ICP monitoring to reduce in-hospital and 2-week post-injury mortality. It is difficult to demonstrate a direct association between specific monitoring and outcome improvement. Indeed, in a randomized trial [4] involving patients with severe TBI, ICP-guided therapy was not shown to be superior to care based on imaging and clinical examination. Recent studies [5\u20137] have also yielded conflicting results. Invasive ICP measurement is performed by specific catheters, inserted into the intraventricular, intraparenchymal, epidural, subdural or subarachnoid space [8]. The ideal ICP monitoring device should be reliable, accurate, cost-effective and be associated with minimal morbidity. Today, the intraventricular catheter remains the most reliable method (gold standard) for ICP monitoring, as it measures global ICP, provided that no obstruction of CSF flow occurs. The main features of ICP monitoring catheters are shown in Table 3. Recently, the intraparenchymal catheters used for ICP monitoring have integrated a CSF drainage catheter and catheters that detect parameters, such as brain tissue O2 partial pressure (PbtO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Epidural, subdural and subarachnoid catheters are less accurate and are therefore rarely used.",

It may indicate the need for invasive brain monitoring and direct treatment in a multifactorial multimodal neuromonitoring approach [9]. TCD detects blood flow velocity (FV) through the major intracranial vessels, most commonly the middle cerebral artery (MCA). In cases of elevated ICP, the external pressure in the cerebral vessels increases, which is reflected by changes in FV. Detection of reduced FV indicates impediment to CBF and indirectly increased ICP. Besides the mean FV, pulsatility index (PI) and slopes of the TCD waveforms have been correlated with ICP [10\u201313]. It has been found that PI changes in the MCA are associated with changes in ICP, when the latter is between 5\u201340 mmHg. However, the accuracy of the technique depends on the experience of the operator and, in addition, 10\u201315% of the patients do not have adequate bone window.",

Current MMM consensus consider PbtO2 of less than 20 mmHg as threshold to consider intervention [1]. Studies have shown that low PbtO2 can be observed in combination with either high or low ICP [17], which enhances the value of brain oxygen monitoring. Thus, MMM consensus suggest its use to assist titration of medical and surgical therapies to guide ICP/CPP therapy, identify refractory IH and treatment thresholds, help manage delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and select patients for second-tier therapy [1]. Finally, a tendency to better outcomes with combined PbtO2 and ICP/CPP therapy compared to ICP/CPP therapy alone has been shown in severe TBI [18].",

Several molecular and cellular pathways [27, 28] are activated in SBI. Thus, changes in ionic permeability, release of excitatory neurotransmitters and increased free radical accumulation cause mitochondrial dysfunction, which further triggers energy defects and processes of necrosis and apoptosis. These molecular and cellular changes could lead to the development of cytotoxic or vasogenic brain edema and disturbed autoregulation, resulting in an increase in the volume of intracranial components due to vasodilation or water accumulation, or both [29]. SBI is predictable and treatable and may be the result of extracranial (e.g. hypoxia, hypercapnia, arterial hypotension, fever) or intracranial (e.g. hematomas, contusions, seizures) factors (Table 5). Indeed, hypoxia and arterial hypotension trigger the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which may further aggravate the development of secondary damage [30]. Trauma affects the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) directly, with increased permeability, favoring vasogenic edema formation and activation of a proinflammatory state [31]. Seizures may aggravate the imbalance between energy expenditure and supply [32]. The control of all these variables has been shown to improve both neurological and functional outcomes of patients [33].",

Also, there are data [39, 40] claiming that the effect of PEEP on ICP depends on whether it causes alveolar hyperinflation or recruitment.

In contrast, in patients with impaired autoregulation, hypotension leads to cerebral ischemia due to CPP reduction. Nearly all patients with severe TBI exhibit hypotension, even in the absence of hemorrhage. This is regarded as a result of both administration of sedation / analgesia and severe SIRS.

            "text": "The optimal value\u2014target for CPP is a matter of debate. The minimum CPP value required to prevent cerebral ischemia is generally acceptable at 50\u201360 mmHg [49]. However, two distinct approaches have developed with differing views on whether CPP should be maintained at a higher or lower level. The Rosner concept [50] advocates an increased MAP, aiming at a higher CPP value in order to maintain adequate CBF. In contrast, the Lund concept [51] advocates reducing intravascular resistance and hydrostatic pressure and reducing CBV, thereby increasing CBF and making a lower CPP acceptable. According to the last guidelines for TBI [3], the recommended target CPP value is between 60 and 70 mmHg, as it has been associated with improved survival and favorable outcomes. However, whether 60 or 70 mmHg is the minimum optimal CPP threshold is unclear and may depend upon the patient\u2019s autoregulatory status. At the same time, aggressive efforts to maintain CPP > 70 mmHg with fluids and vasopressors should be avoided because of the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Moreover, excessive elevation of CPP favors edema formation by increasing capillary hydrostatic pressure across the BBB [52]. Therefore, it is worth noting that the optimal CPP depends on the particularities of each patient and should be individualized based on MMM. Advanced monitoring techniques such as PbtO2 and SjvO2 measurement, EEG and microdialysis may eventually allow clinicians to optimize CPP based on specific physiological circumstances in a particular patient at any given point in time.",

It has been shown that patients with ICH, who develop a body temperature > 37.5 \u00b0C within the first 72 h, have significantly worse outcomes determined as Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) 1 or 2 [56]. In addition, in a later study of 110 TBI patients Stocchetti et al. demonstrated that fever within the first week was associated with increased ICP, significant neurologic impairment and prolonged ICU stay [57]. Due to the harmful effect of increased temperature on the cerebral parenchyma, it is recommended that it should not exceed 37 \u00b0C. To this end, early aggressive measures to control temperature in the patient with ABI should be implemented. These include intravenous and enteral antipyretic medications, control of room temperature, and cooling blankets or pads. A French study involving patients with septic shock showed that fever control using external cooling was safe and decreased vasopressor requirements and early mortality [58]. Regarding early hypothermia induction as a primary neuroprotective strategy in severe TBI patients, two recent randomized, multicenter clinical trials [59, 60] did not confirm its usefulness, given that prophylactic hypothermia was associated with poor outcomes (no difference on GOS at 6 months). Thus, the TBI guidelines [3] do not recommend early (within 2.5 h), short-term (48 h post-injury) prophylactic hypothermia to improve outcomes in patients with diffuse brain injury.",

The use of prophylactic antiepileptic treatment for the prevention of SBI was a topic of investigation for many years. In a randomized, double-blind study Temkin et al. [68] examined the role of phenytoin in the prevention of early and late post-traumatic seizures (PTS). The results showed a statistically significant difference in the rate of early PTS in phenytoin group compared with placebo group (3.6 vs 14.2%, P < 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two groups in PTS rates from day 8 until the end of follow-up. The recent BTF guidelines [3] are in accordance with these results and do not recommend the prophylactic use of phenytoin or valproate for preventing late PTS. Phenytoin is recommended to decrease the incidence of early PTS (within 7 days of injury), when the overall benefit is felt to outweigh the complications associated with such treatment. Prophylactic antiepileptic therapy in other acute neurological conditions (e.g. spontaneous ICH [48], ischemic stroke [69]) is not recommended.",

However, prolonged, aggressive hyperventilation may lead to a critical decrease in local cerebral perfusion and cerebral ischemia, potentially resulting in worsening of neurologic injury, particularly in the first 24 to 48 h [70, 71]. Therefore, hyperventilation may have a role as a temporizing measure for the reduction of elevated ICP. Meanwhile, SjvO2 or PbtO2 measurements can be used to monitor oxygen delivery. Finally, it is worth noting that hyperventilation should not be abruptly discontinued but should be tapered slowly over 4\u20136 h to avoid vasodilatation of cerebral arterioles and rebound increases in ICP [72].",

Osmotic agents reduce brain tissue volume by drawing free water out of brain tissue and into the systemic circulation, where it is then excreted by the kidneys [73]. The beneficial effect of hyperosmolar therapy requires an intact BBB. Otherwise, as in traumatic contusion, BBB disruption allows equilibration of molecules between blood and interstitial fluid of the brain. Thus, osmotic agents exert their effect largely by removing water from the remaining normal brain tissue [74].",

Its strong osmotic force is due to its high reflection coefficient (\u03c3 = 0, 9). Mannitol also acts by other mechanisms, such as induction of reflex cerebral arteriolar vasoconstriction, improvement in blood rheology, reduction of CSF formation [75], and free radicals scavenging [76]. Its effect is dose-dependent [75], since a positive correlation has been demonstrated between dose and magnitude of ICP reduction. The recommended ICP lowering dose of mannitol (usually 20%) is 0.25 to 1 g/kg every 6 h [77, 78], although doses < 0.5 g/kg are usually considered less effective. Serum osmolality should be maintained between 310 and 320 mOsm/l, while some researchers advocate that even higher levels can be cautiously tolerated [74, 79]. Mannitol is excreted entirely in urine and there is a risk of acute tubular necrosis if serum osmolality exceeds these recommended levels. Other adverse effects of mannitol include hypotension, electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia) and rebound cerebral edema after prolonged use. Mannitol is contraindicated in patients with renal failure [80] due to the risk of osmotic nephrosis [81] and possible pulmonary edema and heart failure.",

Other mechanisms of action include induction of reflex cerebral arteriolar vasoconstriction, improved deformability of erythrocytes with enhanced microcirculation, and an anti-inflammatory effect due to reduced adhesion of polymononuclear cells in the cerebral microvasculature [82\u201384]. In literature, concentrations of HS used to treat IH, were ranging from 3% to 23.4%. Bolus doses are usually administered in response to a measured ICP and may be repeated as needed until either the ICP is in an acceptable range or serum sodium concentrations have risen above normal (> 145\u2013155 mEq/L) [85]. Possible adverse effects of HS include rebound cerebral edema, electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia), congestive heart failure, renal failure, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, phlebitis, transient hypotension, hemolysis, osmotic demyelination, subarachnoid bleeding, seizures and muscle twitching [86].",

[88] performed a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (RCT), comparing the above osmotic agents in the treatment of IH from a variety of causes. HS appeared to have greater efficacy in managing elevated ICP, but the effect on clinical outcomes was not assessed. Mortazavi et al. [89] reached the same conclusion, noting the absence of clear neurological outcome benefit. A more recent meta-analysis [90], including 7 RCT and 191 patients, also highlighted the superiority of HS when compared to mannitol in the treatment of elevated ICP. Regarding the 6-month mortality, no difference was observed, with limited adverse reactions reported. Conversely, Cochrane analysis [91] concluded that mannitol treatment for IH may have a detrimental effect on mortality when compared to HS. It is worth noting that, in a study by Sakellaridis et al. [92], there was no significant difference in the extent of reduction of ICP or duration of action between the two medications. Therefore, in recent years, the characterization of mannitol as a \"gold standard\" is controversial and the role of HS in IH [93] is upgraded. Hence, the last TBI guidelines in contrast with the previous ones advocate that there are insufficient evidence about effects on clinical outcomes to support use of any specific hyperosmolar agent [3]. In particular, there is no difference on GOS at 6 months and mortality.",

Additional benefits of propofol include increased seizure threshold and a better quality of sedation when compared to midazolam [95].

Later, Cochrane analysis [103] did not reach the same conclusion, noting that barbiturates may reduce ICP, but there is no difference in death or disability, measured using the GOS, in patients with acute \u03a4\u0392\u0399. However, according to the BTF guidelines [3], high-dose barbiturate administration is recommended to control elevated ICP refractory to maximum standard medical and surgical treatment. They also emphasize that hemodynamic stability is essential before and during therapy.",

Indeed, favorable neurologic outcome and reduced mortality using therapeutic hypothermia have only been demonstrated after ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia cardiac arrest [104, 105]. Recently, a study of Nielsen et al. [106] which involved patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest showed different results. In particular, there was no difference in neurological outcome or survival, at a targeted temperature of 33 \u00b0C vs 36 \u00b0C. Regarding the treatment of TBI patients, a systematic review and meta-analysis [107] showed that therapeutic hypothermia may be of benefit in reducing rates of death, vegetative state, and long-term disability. However, there remains a need for more, high quality RCT in this patient population. Lastly, Andrews et al. [108] compared therapeutic hypothermia (32\u201335 \u00baC) plus standard care, with standard care alone, in 387 patients with ICP > 20 mmHg after TBI. They concluded that hypothermia does not improve long-term outcome, determined as extended GOS (GOS-E) 1 to 4 at 6 months, although it appears to reduce ICP and PbtO2 [109].",

The large, international, multicenter, randomized STICH II trial [111] included 601 patients with spontaneous supratentorial lobar ICH without intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus, treating them either with early surgery or conservatively. It showed that early surgery did not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial ICH without intraventricular hemorrhage. Recent guidelines for spontaneous ICH [48] recommend surgical removal of the hemorrhage as soon as possible for patients with cerebellar hemorrhage who are deteriorating neurologically or who have brainstem compression and/or hydrocephalus from ventricular obstruction. In addition, they emphasize that supratentorial hematoma evacuation in deteriorating patients might be considered as a life-saving measure [48]. Other acceptable indications for removal of a mass lesion include evacuation of subdural and epidural hematomas, brain abscesses, and resection of brain tumors. Recently, RCT STITCH (Trauma) [112] compared early surgery with the initial conservative treatment in 170 patients with traumatic ICH. It concluded that early surgery was associated with significantly fewer deaths in the first 6 months, compared with conservative treatment (15 vs 33%, P = 0.006). However, further well-designed trials are required to assess whether this encouraging signal can be confirmed in TBI patients.",

In this way, DC alone lowers ICP by 15% and with dural opening by 70%. The main indication for DC is massive hemispheric ischemic stroke. A meta-analysis [113] of 3 RCT (DECIMAL, HAMLET, DESTINY) showed that early (< 48 h) decompressive hemicraniectomy in massive ischemic stroke significantly improved survival (78 vs 29%) and resulted in better neurological outcomes, measured using mRS at 1 year, compared to conservative therapy. In literature, two more recent reviews and meta-analyses [114, 115] reached the same conclusions. The guidelines for ischemic stroke [69] note that decompressive surgery may be the only effective option for very severe cases but decision making should include patient-centered preferences. In patients with spontaneous ICH, DC with or without hematoma evacuation might reduce mortality for patients with supratentorial ICH who are in a coma, have large hematomas with significant midline shift, or have elevated ICP refractory to medical management [48]. Regarding TBI, the recent BTF guidelines [3] do not recommend bifrontal DC to improve outcomes, as measured by the GOS-E at 6 months post-injury, although this procedure has been demonstrated to reduce ICP and to minimize days in the ICU [3]. These guidelines were based on DECRA trial [116], which involved 155 patients with severe diffuse TBI and refractory IH. In this trial, early bifrontotemporoparietal DC decreased ICP and the length of stay in the ICU, but was associated with more unfavorable outcomes indicated by the GOS-E at 6 months after the injury. However, the study faced intense criticism and some authorities claimed that it should have no influence on clinical practice. Later, RESCUEicp trial [117] showed that DC had more favorable results on outcome. 408 patients with TBI and refractory IH (ICP > 25 mmHg), underwent DC or received ongoing medical care were randomized. At 6 months, DC resulted in lower mortality (26.9 vs 48.9%) but higher rates of vegetative state and severe disability than medical care. However, more studies are required to determine which patients will benefit with mortality reduction but minimize risk for vegetative state and poor functional outcomes [118].",

This is supported by new observational studies and meta-analyses, although ICP monitoring itself does not seem to affect outcome [4]. The intensivists can optimize IH treatment by modifying factors such as vasoreactivity and CBF, blood/brain osmotic gradient, CMRO2 and issues of intracranial compliance. To date, many interventions, such as surgical decompression, hypothermia, barbiturates and osmotic agents, have been shown to be effective in reducing ICP but with controversial effects on outcome (Table 6) [127, 128]. The risks and benefits of any medical and surgical intervention must be carefully evaluated. An optimal therapeutic strategy is considered the step-by-step escalation of available interventions [29, 129], tailored for each patient. Prophylactic measures are common for almost all patients with IH, while acute interventions, in order to reduce ICP, should be individualized (Fig. 3).",

An optimal therapeutic strategy is considered the step-by-step escalation of available interventions [29, 129], tailored for each patient. The primary goal is to maintain ICP below 22 mmHg and CPP above 60 mmHg [3]. Initially, general prophylactic measures should be applied immediately to all patients with suspected IH. Based on specific indications and conditions, surgical resection of mass lesions [48] and CSF drainage [3, 48, 69] should be considered as an initial treatment for lowering ICP. The following steps in turn include hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline) [3], which represents the cornerstone of medical treatment of acute IH, hyperventilation and therapeutic hypothermia [107, 108]. \u03a4o control elevated ICP refractory to maximum standard medical and surgical treatment, at first, high-dose barbiturate administration [3] and then decompressive craniectomy [3, 48, 69] as a last step are recommended.
