            "text": "Traumatic pneumothorax is a common sequela of motor vehicular accidents and was found concurrently in 47% of dogs with pulmonary contusions.41 It has also been reported in most (63%) cats with high-rise syndrome.42 External wounds, such as a projectile injury, bite wounds, and penetrating sharp objects to the thorax and cervical spine, are also frequent causes. Iatrogenic pneumothorax following thoracentesis is common, with an incidence of 3% to 20% in humans, with approximately 20% of those patients requiring a thoracostomy tube(s) placement.14 Other common iatrogenic causes include leakage following lung lobectomy or respiratory tract surgery, thoracostomy tubes, fine-needle lung aspiration, barotrauma during positive-pressure ventilation, and tracheal tears. Spontaneous pneumothorax is most often associated with pulmonary bullous emphysema in dogs, with the Siberian Husky being overrepresented.43 Multiple other pathologic conditions can lead to a spontaneous pneumothorax: neoplasia, feline asthma, pulmonary abscess, heartworm disease and other parasitic infections, foreign body migration, subpleural blebs, and pneumonia.6 Finally, an infectious pneumothorax can be created by gas-forming bacteria within the thoracic cavity.",

If the pneumothorax is not easily relieved with thoracentesis, an emergency minithoracostomy, with intubation and mechanical ventilation may prove lifesaving. Decreased venous return to the thorax in animals with a tension pneumothorax can be associated with cardiovascular collapse and shock. The thorax may become barrel shaped, and limited chest expansion is noted despite significant respiratory effort. However, animals with subclinical air accumulation may not require thoracentesis and the animal's progression should be followed closely because the air will be reabsorbed over days to weeks. A small amount of air in animals with severe pulmonary pathology may contribute significantly to dyspnea and should be relieved. Most patients with a closed traumatic or iatrogenic pneumothorax require thoracentesis only once or twice.",

A spontaneous pneumothorax in dogs is best treated with surgical exploration, leading to a higher survival rate and decreased recurrence.43 Thoracoscopic lobectomy has also been described in these patients.44 Overall prognosis is good, with an 86% survival rate for treated dogs and cats with various causes of air accumulation. Favorable prognostic factors included absence of dyspnea, no need for thoracentesis, longer intensive care stay for dogs, and normal body temperature on admission in cats.45\n",

Increased incidence of RPE has been associated with a longer duration of collapsed lung (\u226572 hours).
