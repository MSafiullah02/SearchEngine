            "text": "Domestic rabbits are descended from the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus. The ancestral form probably evolved in the Iberian Peninsula and spread to other parts of the Mediterranean (Fox, 1974). Fossil records show that the European rabbit was confined to the Iberian peninsula and southern France following the Pleistocene era. While rabbits have been associated with man since Roman times, they have only been truly domesticated for around 200 years. The geographical range of the rabbit has been altered significantly by man, who from Roman times onwards placed rabbits on islands on various shipping routes, to allow them to breed and form a ready source of food. Thus their European range significantly altered, and rabbits proved very successful where the climate and geographical conditions were suitable. More recently rabbits were introduced in Victoria, Australia, where their success, due to rapid breeding and a lack of suitable predators, rapidly became a plague that cost the Australian Government millions of dollars and led to the implementation of myxomatosis virus for biological control. Although European rabbits have been released in North America, the presence of suitable predators, an unsuitable climate and other species filling their ecological niche proved insurmountable. In North America the native wild rabbit is either Sylvilagus floridanus (cottontail) or Sylvilagus bachmani (brush rabbit). The North American jackrabbit, Lepus californicus, is from the hare genus.",

For example, cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.) do not dig burrows, although they may use burrows made by other animals. Females dig holes to make nests and sit over the hole to suckle the young. Vegetation is used to cover the fur-lined nest between feeds. Cottontails are solitary animals, in contrast with Oryctolagus cuniculus, which live in groups with a defined social hierarchy (Nowak, 1999).",

The main surface entrances are usually indicated by mounds of earth but there are numerous other small openings that lack these mounds. Oryctolagus cuniculus is essentially nocturnal, leaving the burrow in the early evening and returning in the morning, although it can be seen grazing or basking during the day. The home range is rarely larger than 20 hectares (Nowak, 1999).",

The group\u2019s territory is defended by the males, while the females dig out deep burrows to nest in. Male rabbits within the group will establish a dominance hierarchy, with the older heavier males at the top. Aged males that have been usurped by younger, fitter rabbits are driven from the group to become solitary satellite males (Lockley, 1978). Young male rabbits are also often driven from the group when they reach puberty either to join another warren or to lead solitary lives in the hedgerows. The females tend to remain within the original group. Female rabbits are less aggressive towards each other than males, but will defend a chosen nesting site ferociously. Territories are scent marked with pheromones from the scent glands on the chin and genital area or by urine marking. Dominant males will continually scent mark their territory by rubbing their chins on branches and bushes and leaving piles of strategically placed faeces. They also mark territory by spraying urine, sometimes on to other individuals.",

Initially, they graze grass and vegetation, raising their heads at intervals to survey the surroundings, perhaps chewing through a long stalk or blade of grass at the same time. After half an hour or so, they will start to look around for other palatable plants to nibble. They are constantly on the lookout for danger and will readily bolt back to their burrow. Hard faecal pellets are always voided above ground, never in the burrow and soft caecotrophs are usually consumed during periods of rest underground, although occasionally rabbits exhibit this behaviour above ground (Lockley, 1978). The only vocal sounds that are made are a loud high-pitched scream of terror or a range of growls and hums that denote pleasure or defence. Apprehensive or frightened rabbits will thump the ground with their hind feet. The loud thumping sounds acts as an alarm signal to other rabbits in the vicinity.",

Domestication has resulted in rabbits that are far tamer than their wild counterparts and easy to handle. Although some domestic rabbits still retain the tendency to dig holes and live underground, many do not, with the result that domestic rabbits that escape or are released do not survive for long in the wild. Conversely, wild rabbits seldom become tame in captivity, although the occasional individual will overcome its fear of humans. Hand-reared orphans usually grow into fearful adults. Even rabbits that are born as a result of egg transfer from a wild rabbit to a domesticated tame host retain their shy nature (Adams, 1987).",

The fur breeds include rex, Angoras and satin rabbits with their beautiful coat textures. Fancy breeds include the Belgian hare, and lop and dwarf rabbits with their varying physical characteristics. Most pet rabbits belong to the smaller breeds such as dwarf lops, Dutch or English. Pedigree rabbit breeders often sell surplus stock to the pet trade and occasionally one of the more obscure breeds may turn up as a pet. Pedigree stock is identified by aluminium rings slipped over the hock when the rabbit is 8\u201310 weeks old. The rings are supplied by the British Rabbit Council in a range of sizes. Each ring has the year of birth and a unique number from which the rabbit can be identified. Many pet rabbits are the result of interbreeding between pets and are cross-breeds. As with other domestic animals, there are breed predispositions to disease. For example, dwarf rabbits are prone to congenital incisor malocclusion (Fox and Crary, 1971). Dutch, Havana and tan rabbits have a high incidence of uterine neoplasia (Greene, 1941).",

Plucked wool is superior to shorn wool. Commercial Angoras are kept in a specialized manner to prevent staining and matting of the fur. After defleecing, woollen jackets can be worn for 2\u20133 weeks to reduce heat loss or a strip of fleece can be left along the back (Lebas et al., 1998). Commercial Angoras are not provided with bedding but are kept on wire mesh floors and hay is provided in a rack. The long fine coat is a definite disadvantage for the pet animal as it difficult to keep the rabbit free from knots and mats. It is not surprising that a high number of Angoras arrive at rescue shelters for rehoming. The breed is prone to intestinal obstruction by felts of ingested hair.",

In the late afternoon wild rabbits emerge from their burrows to feed, explore, socialize and mate. Grazing resumes during the early morning before the rabbit returns to the warren. Hard faecal pellets are voided during these periods above ground. During the day, caecotrophy (see Section 1.3.1) takes place while the rabbit is resting in the burrow, typically between 08.00 and 17.00 h. Female rabbits give birth in the morning and feed their young at night (McBride, 1988). Domesticated rabbits also follow a natural daily rhythm. Laboratory rabbits that are fed ad lib consume little food between 06.00 h and midday and increase their intake between 17.00 h and midnight, eating most food during the night. Caecotrophs are expelled during periods of minimal feed intake in the morning and sometimes during the evening. If food is restricted, caecotrophs are excreted approximately 5 h after a meal. If a collar is fitted to prevent the ingestion of caecotrophs, feeding still ceases during caecotroph excretion, suggesting that cessation of food intake is not associated with gastric filling (H\u00f6rnicke et al., 1984).",

Ingestion of food is associated with increased caecal motility and the excretion of hard faeces. Caecotrophy is associated with a decline in caecal contractions, so caecal contractions are at a maximum when the animal is feeding. If food is withheld completely, the circadian rhythm of caecal contractions is maintained, but at a lower frequency that does not correlate with soft or hard faeces production (H\u00f6rnicke et al., 1984). Absorption of volatile fatty acids and their metabolism in the liver shows a circadian rhythm parallel to the activity of the adrenal gland. Volatile fatty acid absorption into the portal circulation is greatest during the hard faeces phase of digestion, although arterial levels remain remarkably constant (Vernay, 1987). Bile acid production shows a circadian rhythm (Fekete, 1989). There is a diurnal variation in haematological values (Fox and Laird, 1970), with lowest total white blood cell and lymphocyte counts occurring in the late afternoon and evening in association with increased neutrophil counts. Eosinophil counts peak during the afternoon, with the lowest values occurring in the morning. Blood urea nitrogen shows a diurnal variation that is linked with feeding patterns. Even body temperature follows a 24-h cycle (Lazarus-Barlow, 1928).",

Units housing several thousand does are found in countries such as China, Hungary and the USA. At the other end of the scale, in the developing world, a few rabbits are often kept as \u2018biological refrigerators\u2019, i.e. a source of small quantities of meat that is fresh and readily available and which can be eaten before it goes off (Cheeke et al., 1982). The social and behavioural needs of such animals are ignored when they are housed individually in small, wire mesh cages or confined to tiny hutches. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and other animal health and welfare associations promote the \u2018Five Freedoms\u2019 of animal welfare:\u2022Freedom from hunger and thirst\u2022Freedom from discomfort\u2022Freedom from pain injury and disease\u2022Freedom to behave normally\u2022Freedom from fear and distressin order that guidelines for animal husbandry and nutrition as far as possible advance the welfare of pet and production animals. There are many welfare implications associated with keeping rabbits in cages, as they are not able to follow their natural instincts.Abnormal behaviour patterns such as stereotypies and restlessness have been recorded. Perpetual wire biting and pawing behaviour has been described in rabbits confined to small cages and does provided with an open nesting box and no bedding material to cover the young (Stauffacher, 1992). A proven link has been established between small cage size and painful conditions such as skeletal disorders or ulcerative pododermatitis in intensively reared rabbits (Drescher, 1993, Drescher and Loeffler, 1996). Morphological differences have been observed in the adrenal glands of rabbits kept in wire cages and those kept in group housing conditions on solid floors (Drescher and Breig, 1993).",

            "text": "In recent years, conditions have improved for many laboratory rabbits. They can be kept in social groups of four to eight animals with no detriment to their health (Turner et al., 1997). It has been proven that rabbits prefer to be in proximity with each other as they are a social species with a defined hierarchy. They also \u2018interact with enrichment objects\u2019 such as wooden sticks, parrot toys or balls designed for cats (Huls et al., 1991). Keeping rabbits in this way not only benefits the rabbits but also the people looking after them. Love (1994) described the response of animal technicians to group housing by saying they \u2018found it more agreeable to work with rabbits that came to the front of the cage when they heard the sounds of people, rather than cowering away\u2019 and \u2018it was a pleasure to see the rabbits interact with each other\u2019. Stauffacher (1992) describes in detail many ways in which housing for rabbits can be constructed to permit natural behaviour patterns. Despite these advances, most breeding and exhibition rabbits still live their entire life confined to small cages. Some breeders still insist that rabbits should be kept singly in small cages and that large hutches and runs lead to aggression and behaviour problems (Sandford, 1996). At last, the pet-owning fraternity is becoming aware of the rabbit\u2019s social nature and need for exercise. There has been a steady increase in the number of house rabbits and the status of the rabbit has shifted from the child\u2019s pet to a member of the family. A rabbit can be a satisfactory companion for adults that are out at work all day and find the needs of a dog or cat too demanding. Hopefully the days of keeping pet rabbits in solitary confinement in a barren hutch at the bottom of the garden are now coming to an end. There is legislation governing the welfare of rabbits that is summarized in Box 1.1\n.Box 1.1Legislation governing the welfare of rabbitsThere is legislation governing the welfare of farmed rabbits in the UK. The advice also applies to pet rabbits kept in hutches although they are not technically covered by the legislation. Separate legislation governs the transport and slaughter of rabbits. A guide to the legal requirements for farmed rabbits has been produced by UFAW (Universities Federation for Animal Welfare) and can be summarized as follows:Rabbits must be provided with:\n\u2022Adequate lighting to enable the inspection of the animals at any time.\u2022Wholesome food that is appropriate and in sufficient quantity to maintain good health and satisfy nutritional needs.\u2022A daily supply of fresh drinking water.\u2022Suitable accommodation with a suitably bedded floor for the isolation of a sick or injured rabbit.\u2022Cages of sufficient size to allow the rabbits to move around, feed and drink without difficulty, and allow all the rabbits kept in them to be able to lie on their sides at the same time.\u2022Cages of sufficient height to allow rabbits to sit upright on all four feet without their ears touching the top of the cage.\u2022Shelter from bad weather including direct sunlight.\u2022Daily inspection of all automatic equipment, such as drinkers, by a competent person.\u2022An alarm on automatic ventilation systems that is independent of the mains electricity and will give warning when the system fails to function properly.\u2022Daily inspection of stock and the prevention of unnecessary suffering or distress.\u2022Veterinary care. Prescription-only medicines (POM) including antibiotics and vaccines can only be supplied by the veterinary surgeon that has the rabbits in his/her care.\nIn 2006 section 14 of the Animal Welfare Act made provision for Codes of Practice relating to petkeeping to be formulated and subsequently enforced in Wales, Scotland and England. Currently only Wales has these Codes of Practice in use. The Codes of Practice detail the care and maintenance of rabbits and closely follow the concept of the \u2018Five Freedoms\u2019, and make it an offence to fail to achieve the required standard of care. Currently (2012) there is no similar legislation in force in England. However, the RSPCA has produced some guidelines for rabbit care, which may be found at http://www.rspca.org.uk.There are other national rabbit awareness campaigns ongoing, for example Rabbit Awareness Week, \u2018A hutch is not enough\u2019 and \u2018Make Mine a Chocolate One\u2019, all sponsored by the Rabbit Welfare Association, a national welfare agency dedicated to promoting the health and welfare of rabbits in the UK.",

            "text": "The hutch should be as big as possible, especially if two rabbits are housed together. It needs to be situated in a dry, cool, well-ventilated site protected from wind and rain. The minimum recommended size is sufficient space to hop three times in any direction, and high enough for the rabbit to stand up on its hind legs without its ears touching the roof. This space should be available in both the dark, covered portion of the hutch and the open living space. This space requirement should not include the outdoor run. The RSPCA spatial requirements are somewhat greater, the minimum being 1 m (3 ft) wide \u00d7 2 m (6 ft) long \u00d7 1 m (3 ft) high for both the enclosed and open portions of the living area. In any case where two adult rabbits live together, the space must be increased proportionally and suitable hide areas provided so that each rabbit can get away from the other if they want. The optimum temperature range for rabbits is 15\u201320\u00b0C, which can be checked with a maximum and minimum thermometer. Above this temperature rabbits can suffer from heat stress. Poor ventilation and ammonia build-up predispose to conjunctivitis and respiratory tract infections. It is preferable to situate the hutch against a sheltered wall outside, rather than in an enclosed garage with potential exposure to toxic car fumes. Placing the hutch in a large airy shed can be a good option as shelter is provided with the option of protected exercise space. Many rabbit owners are now using a whole garden shed as a kind of \u2018super-hutch\u2019 for housing two or more rabbits, providing ample indoor space. These sheds are then often attached to large aviary type runs to allow outside access (See Figure 1.1\n). Rabbits are tolerant of cold conditions and can withstand winter weather provided they have shelter and plenty of bedding material. Thin rabbits with no body fat are more susceptible to the effects of cold and need extra protection on cold nights. Hot conditions and direct sunlight with no shade are distressing for rabbits. These conditions are potentially fatal as rabbits cannot sweat or pant effectively, and are far more damaging than cold conditions. The ability to get out of direct sunlight is of paramount importance, and needs to be considered when providing rabbit accommodation. Rabbits are far more capable of coping with cold and even wet conditions, as long as they have the opportunity to shelter and access to enough food and bedding. When planning rabbit accommodation, allowing the rabbit a choice of positions and therefore ambient temperatures, access to sunlight and shelter is a major benefit. Rabbits produce copious quantities of urine and faeces, which are usually deposited in one part of the hutch that should be cleaned once or twice daily. Bedding that is not fouled and remains clean and dry can be left in the hutch; however, with any deep litter system, a full clean should be done at least weekly, or more often if the bedding is wet or smells. Many types of material can be used as bedding. Any bedding material should be non-toxic, free from dust, comfortable to lie on and good insulation. Garden peat has been recommended to neutralize ammonia and reduce irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract (Malley, 1995). An economical bedding material is a layer of newspaper covered in hay. This can be rolled up for disposal. The hay provides ad lib high fibre food in addition to a soft bed that is kind to the hocks. Other options include straw of various types. The advantage to straw is that it is cheap, easily available and very good at allowing fluid to drain away from the surface of the bedding, reducing potential contact with rabbit skin. Straw can be fairly sharp, depending on what type of crop it is made from, and can in some circumstances cause skin and ocular irritation. Rabbits will sometimes eat straw, which can cause oral trauma if it is sharp. Oat straw is an ideal option as it is soft as well as encouraging fluid drainage. Commercial forms of bedding are also available. These are often recycled paper products, and are well accepted by rabbits, although they are not the most economical bedding. Woodshavings and chips are not recommended because of the potential for dust to cause ocular and respiratory irritation and the possibility of sharp edges causing skin/mouth/eye wounds. Wood products containing aromatic oils may cause respiratory irritation and have been reported to cause hepatotoxicity.",

The opportunity to explore is mentally beneficial. All methods of providing exercise should be escape proof, although escapees instinctively remain close to their home territory and can usually be found providing they have not been carried off by a predator or are in search of a receptive mate.

However, their destructive and burrowing instincts, along with a taste for bedding plants, means free access to the garden should be supervised. Free rabbits are also prey to neighbours\u2019 dogs, cats and other animals such as foxes, so supervision or a well-fenced area or mesh pen is required. Ideally this should be a permanent structure that allows the rabbit to establish a familiar territory and feel secure.

            "text": "Rabbits are social creatures that benefit from companionship, preferably from another rabbit. A bonded pair becomes inseparable (see Figure 1.2\n). They spend time grooming each other and there are many benefits to mutual grooming, such as reducing parasite numbers in the fur and cleaning inaccessible places such as the face or back of the neck. Occasionally, a dominant rabbit will barber the fur of its companion. Neutering rabbits that are kept together is necessary to prevent fighting and unwanted pregnancies. Guinea pigs are sometimes kept as companions for rabbits, although this arrangement is not as satisfactory as two rabbits together. There is a small risk of the guinea pig contracting Bordetella bronchiseptica, which is asymptomatic in rabbits but can cause pneumonia in guinea pigs. Neutering is required to prevent bullying and constant sexual harassment of the guinea pig. Regardless, some rabbits will still bully their guinea pig companion, and hide boxes small enough to allow the pig in but exclude the rabbit should be provided. If the bullying is severe the welfare of the guinea pig is better served by breaking up the pair. Choosing to pair a rabbit with a guinea pig should not be advocated; however, where a stable pair exists, then the bond is similar to that between two rabbits and should not be broken unless the welfare of the guinea pig is suffering.Key Points 1.1Bonding\n\u2022Rabbits gain benefit from living in pairs. It reduces boredom and increases contentment.\u2022In the wild, rabbits are a social species with a defined social hierarchy.\u2022Not every pair of rabbits will bond successfully. Compatible pairings are more likely to bond; several potential partners may need to be tried.\u2022The recommended pairing is a neutered female with a neutered male; however, other pairings are possible, depending on the individual rabbit.\u2022Both rabbits should be neutered prior to attempting bonding, and ideally should also be tested for E. cuniculi, so seropositive animals are paired with seropositive, and negative with negative.\u2022Rabbits that are going to be bonded should be housed next to each other, so that they can see and smell the other rabbit.\u2022It is sensible to place food items near to the barrier between the two rabbits, as eating is a social activity in rabbits, and this should be encouraged.\u2022Either bedding should be moved from each enclosure and placed into the other every day, to allow the scent of the potential partner to become familiar, or the rabbits themselves should be moved into the other enclosure for the same reason, but also to reduce territoriality.\u2022Once the rabbits have become familiar with each other, they can be physically introduced. This should take place in a neutral area. Placing rabbits into a bath tub has been suggested; however, a rabbit pen in an unfamiliar room works just as well.\u2022Injury and direct fighting should be avoided; rabbits displaying aggression should be separated. Care is needed as this is where owners can get bitten.\u2022Aggressive signs:1.Ears held back2.Tail raised3.Tension in haunches.\n\u2022Dominance sign:Mounting (either sex).\n\u2022Positive signs:1.Initial indifference2.Laying down calmly but separately3.Licking the other rabbit\u2019s face4.Mutual grooming5.Lying side by side.\n\u2022Once the rabbits are comfortable with each other, the time spent together can be increased. Ten to 15 minutes daily is long enough to start with, but this can be increased to several short sessions daily, or longer sessions depending on the behaviour of the rabbits.\u2022The next step is to feed the rabbits together.\u2022Once the rabbits are spending time and eating together, then they can be allowed to use the same sleeping area and be left together permanently.\u2022Some workers advocate \u2018stress bonding\u2019. This is not necessary if the bonding process is going well; however, for two individuals that are proving difficult it may overcome the obstacles to allow a successful bond. It involves the use of a stressful situation to get the rabbits to take comfort from each other. It must be recognized that this is a means to achieve a long-term bond. In the short term it is an adverse experience to create a long-term benefit.\u2022Stressful situations could include taking both rabbits on a car ride, placing them together in a carrier on top of the washing machine (that is switched on) or next to a switched-on vacuum cleaner. Once the rabbits are snuggling close to each other for comfort, they can then be placed into an enclosure in a neutral area to continue to interact in the same way as regular bonding. Eventually the rabbits can be allowed to interact in the neutral area without being stressed first.\u2022Remember that bonding is a difficult process and many rehoming charities provide specialist help to bond compatible animals.\n\n",

It is not possible to predict accurately whether newly introduced rabbits will form an instant rapport or attack each other. Neutered rabbits of the opposite sex are most likely to bond, although it is possible to keep same sex pairs together. Pairs of male rabbits need to be castrated to prevent fighting. Ideally, rabbits should be introduced on neutral territory with plenty of room for escape and hiding places to retreat into. If this is not possible, introducing the female to the male on his territory is more likely to be successful than the reverse. When they are first introduced, most rabbits spend a period chasing each other around and pulling some hair out, but will settle down eventually. A rabbit that has spent its entire life confined to a hutch may not realize that it can run around and is daunted by both the great outdoors and its new companion. It is not unusual for such rabbits to remain quiet and immobile for several days before they gain confidence and start to explore. If possible, a period of separated proximity is advisable to allow rabbits to become accustomed to each other\u2019s presence before they are introduced. Adjacent pens separated by wire mesh allow rabbits to sniff each other; also change around the bedding to get the rabbits used to the scent of the proposed companion in their own territory. It is a promising sign when the two are found lying side by side on either side of the mesh. Some rabbits never bond; others accept any new companion readily.",

It is important to provide exercise during the winter as well as the summer.

They seem impervious to cold and as long as they have access to shelter, plenty of food and protection from predators, rabbits can be kept outside during the winter. Thin or ill rabbits or those that have not been acclimatized should not be kept in this fashion and need to be given extra protection indoors or in a hutch or shed during inclement weather. They can be allowed outside if the weather is good. If rabbits are not exposed to natural daylight during the winter months, vitamin D deficiency can occur.

The rabbits were kept in an open-air turfed enclosure with several trees and bushes. They were kept in groups of up to 30 animals and their daily activities followed a double diurnal rhythm with periods of rest alternating with periods of activity around dusk and dawn. During periods of rest, the rabbits sought out places with a good overview of the enclosure under bushes or near trees where they would huddle together and engage in mutual grooming. This method of husbandry permits natural behaviour patterns, encourages grazing and normal caecotrophy and allows animals to groom themselves and each other thoroughly, thereby removing skin debris, dead hair and parasites from the coat. In a study by Harcourt-Brown and Baker (2001) blood samples from rabbits kept under free-range conditions had higher red cell and lymphocyte counts than rabbits kept in hutches, suggesting that they were healthier (see Figure 2.1).",

Many house rabbits have their own room that contains an open hutch or childs \u2018wendy-house\u2019 for sleeping. Most house rabbits are neutered, especially males, to reduce territory marking by spraying or defecating outside the litter tray.

Hay, straw, cat litter, peat, soil or \u2018natural\u2019 litters made from hemp, corn cobs or reclaimed wood pulp are all used as litter, materials for rabbits. Clay litters are not advisable as some rabbits will eat the litter, which can then impact the caecum (Brown, 1997).Key Points 1.2Litter training\n\u2022Rabbits are clean animals and can often be easily litter trained.\u2022Most rabbits will have specified areas within their living area that they use to urinate.\u2022Place a litter tray lined with newspaper and filled with hay or straw in these areas and positively reward rabbits when they urinate/defecate in the correct area.\u2022With newly acquired rabbits (where latrine areas have not been established), placing litter trays in each corner can be successful.\u2022While using hay in the litter tray is controversial (because rabbits will often eat this and it can be one way that encephalitozoonosis can be spread) sometimes it will make the difference in successfully litter training a rabbit. This is because rabbits will often eat when using their latrine areas in the wild, and having a food source in the litter tray reinforces the use of the litter tray.\nOrganic solvents in litter materials derived from preserved pine wood shavings or cedar chips have been reported to cause hepatotoxicity and are therefore inadvisable (Rabbit Health News, 1991b). Hay or clean, chopped straw can be used in rabbit litter trays.Key Points 1.3Environmental requirements\n\u2022Hutches are not suitable for rabbits to be kept in all the time.\u2022Daily exercise is vital for physical and mental health of rabbits. At least 4 h exercise daily is recommended, including during the winter months.\u2022Rabbits benefit from companionship and form close bonds. The ideal companion is another rabbit, preferably of the opposite sex. Neutering is required.\u2022Rabbits can be destructive, so they should be either restricted or supervised when out for exercise in the house or garden.\u2022All rabbits must have access to ad lib hay and fresh water at all times. In winter water bottle nozzles can freeze, so if rabbits are housed outdoors, this should be checked regularly.\u2022Most rabbits naturally use a litter tray (see Key Points 1.2). Spot cleaning of the environment should be undertaken at least daily and a thorough clean done weekly.\u2022Rabbits benefit from somewhere to hide in the face of potentially stressful situations. One hide area per rabbit, plus one so that they can run from one to another, is ideal. It is also worth having a variety of sizes of hide boxes, so that some will fit both rabbits but others will fit only one.\n\n",

There is a thick layer of enamel on the anterior aspect of the upper primary incisors but no enamel on the posterior aspect (Hirschfeld et al., 1973). The enamel on the lower incisors is evenly distributed on all aspects. The distribution of enamel in combination with the occlusal positioning of the upper and lower incisors allows the teeth to be constantly sharpened. Wild rabbits are capable of chewing through aluminium (Adams, 1987). The rate of growth of the upper incisors is approximately 2 mm per week (Shadle, 1936). Canine teeth are absent and there is a wide diastema between the incisors and the premolars and molars, which are grossly indistinguishable from each other. The premolars and molars form a row of five or six cheek teeth that are used for grinding the food before it is swallowed. The food is ground between the cheek teeth with jaw movements of up to 120 per minute (Brewer and Cruise, 1994).",

During the digestion of caecotrophs the stomach pH rises to 3.0 (Blas and Gidenne, 1998). Transit time of food through the stomach is approximately 3\u20136 h (Caraba\u00f1o and Piquer, 1998).",

A single pancreatic duct opens at the junction of the transverse and ascending loops of the duodenum (see Figure 1.3B). This is the accessory pancreatic duct. The terminal part of the main pancreatic duct disappears during embryonic development. The accessory pancreatic duct communicates with both pancreatic lobes. The jejunum is long and convoluted.

An ileocolic valve controls movement of digesta from the ileum into the sacculus rotundus and also prevents reverse flow into the small intestine. Motilin, a polypeptide hormone secreted by enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum and jejunum, stimulates gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Fat stimulates and carbohydrate inhibits its release.

The bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme enables microbial protein to be degraded and absorbed from the small intestine in addition to the amino acids and vitamins present in the caecotrophs.

At the proximal end, the ampulla caecalis coli opens into the first section, which is approximately 10 cm long and has three longitudinal flat bands of muscular tissue or taeniae separating rows of haustra or sacculations. Small protrusions, approximately 0.5 mm in diameter, can be seen on the mucosa in this section of colon. These cauliflower-like protrusions have been termed warzen (warts) and are believed to be unique to lagomorphs. They represent an increase in the surface area of the colon that would favour increased absorption. The protrusions may also assist mechanical separation of intestinal contents. Histologically, the muscular layers of the taenia contain many autonomic fibres that are part of the myenteric plexus (Snipes et al., 1982). The second section of ascending colon is approximately 20 cm in length and has a single taenia and fewer, smaller haustra. There is an abundance of myenteric plexus in this region. The third portion of the ascending colon is termed the fusus coli and is a muscular area about 4 cm long (see Figure 1.5\n). This area is highly innervated and vascular. The mucosal surface of the fusus coli is distinguished by prominent longitudinal folds and contains numerous goblet cells. The fusus coli opens into the fourth section of ascending colon, which is histologically indistinguishable from the transverse and descending colon. Because the fusus coli forms such a natural division between two morphologically and functionally distinct sections of the rabbit colon, many physiological texts have abandoned the traditional description of ascending, transverse and descending colon and use the terms proximal and distal colon instead (Snipes et al., 1982). The proximal colon includes the three taeniae section, the single taenia section and the fusus coli. The distal colon is 80\u2013100 cm long and runs from the fusus coli to the rectum. The mucosa of the distal colon is smooth with no surface specialization. The tunica mucosa possesses short crypts with numerous goblet cells reaching into the base. This section of the colon is thin-walled and usually contains hard faecal pellets.",

The phases of excretion follow a marked circadian rhythm. In caged rabbits with ad lib access to food, feed intake increases from 15.00 to 18.00 h and remains high until midnight. Intake then reduces until 02.00, when a new phase starts, with a maximum at 06.00, ending at 08.00 when the soft faeces phase begins. This natural pattern of feeding behaviour and faecal excretion can be seen in pet rabbits, although it may be altered by type and availability of food, age, pregnancy and lactation (Caraba\u00f1o and Piquer, 1998).",

Intestinal contents are thoroughly mixed by contractions of the caecum and colon that separate the digesta into large indigestible particles, and small particles including bacteria and water-soluble components. The indigestible fraction is moved rapidly through the proximal colon to the fusus coli and distal colon before being excreted from the anus. The fermentable fraction is moved in a retrograde direction back into the caecum. The large indigestible particles (> 0.5 mm) tend to accumulate in the lumen of the proximal part of the ascending colon and are moved distally, whereas smaller fermentable particles accumulate at the circumference in the sac-like haustra. Haustral activity sends the small particles proximally into the caecum. Caecal contractility is greatest during the hard faeces phase when the liquid intestinal contents are mixed and separated in the proximal colon. Periodically, the motility of the caecum and proximal colon alters completely. Haustral activity ceases and caecal material is moved swiftly along the large colon. In the fusus coli the material is then separated into pellets that become encapsulated in mucus. This is the soft faeces phase of excretion. Soft faeces or caecotrophs are expelled at least 4 h after feeding, usually during periods of rest.",

During hard faeces production aldosterone levels are high, but they fall during the soft faeces phase of excretion. Prostaglandins inhibit motility of the proximal colon and stimulate the distal colon, aiding the elimination of soft faeces or caecotrophs (Pairet et al., 1986).",

Haustral activity results from high-frequency repetitive contractions of the haustral walls that last about 3 seconds and coincide with orally migrating shallow annular constrictions. Segmental activity is the result of low-frequency deep annular constrictions that move aborally and last about 14 seconds. The third type of contraction of the proximal colon is a monophasic progressive wave of peristaltic contractions. These peristaltic contractions last about 5 seconds during the hard faeces phase and 1.5 seconds during the soft faeces phase (Ehrlein et al., 1982). Expulsion of caecotrophs coincides with a decrease in motility of the caecum and proximal colon and an increase in motility of the distal colon. The transit time for caecotrophs through the colon is 1.5\u20132.5 times faster than that for hard faeces (Fioramonti and Ruckesbusch, 1976). Motility in the upper gastrointestinal tract remains the same during the hard and soft faeces phases, with slow contractions of the small intestine occurring every 10\u201315 minutes (Ruckesbusch et al., 1985). The differences in colonic motility during the hard and soft faeces phase of excretion are most pronounced in the second section of proximal colon that has a single layer of haustra.",

Small particles are propelled into the caecum, which acts as a huge bacterial fermentation chamber to which nutrients and water are continually added. Studies of the enzymatic activities of the caecal microflora indicate that ammonia use, ureolysis, proteolysis and cellulysis take place in that order. Xylanolysis and pectinolysis also occur (Caraba\u00f1o and Piquer, 1998). The intestinal contents that reach the hindgut are composed of undigested food, excretion products and substances produced by the digestive tract itself. Small particles of complex carbohydrates such as oligosaccharides, cellulose, hemicellulose and pectins that are not digested in the small intestine reach the caecum for bacterial degradation. Plant proteins that are bound to cell wall constituents are also degraded in the caecum to form ammonia that is metabolized to amino acids by the caecal microflora. Products of intestinal cellular desquamation and digestive enzymes act as a nitrogen source for protein synthesis (Fraga, 1998). Soluble ions such as urea are osmotically transferred across the caecal wall to be metabolized. High protein diets increase blood urea levels and increase caecal ammonia levels (Fraga, 1998). During periods of protein deprivation, urea from catabolism passes into the caecum to provide a nitrogen source for bacterial amino acid synthesis (Fekete, 1989). Mucopolysaccharides secreted from goblet cells in the mucosa serve as a significant carbohydrate source for caecal fermentation. Bacteroides spp. ferment mucopolysaccharides (Cheeke, 1987).",

Caecal pH shows a diurnal rhythm similar to feeding behaviour and is most alkaline in the morning and most acid in mid-afternoon (Brewer and Cruise, 1994). Fluctuations in caecal pH have an effect on the population of caecal micro-organisms. Ammonia and volatile fatty acids produced by caecal degradation and fermentation affect caecal pH. Like any continuous culture system, there are a number of homeostatic mechanisms in place. Bicarbonate secreted from the appendix acts as a buffer. Other substances such as fibre also have a buffering capacity dependent on the carboxyl, amino and hydroxyl groups (Gidenne et al., 1998). The rate of production and absorption of volatile fatty acids is dependent on type and availability of substrate. Gut motility affects the supply of nutrients and water for microbial fermentation and the absorption of nutrients. Energy appears to be the most limiting factor for optimum microbial activity (Fraga, 1998).",

Stimulation of rectal mechanoreceptors, the perception of the specific odour of the soft faeces and the blood concentrations of various metabolites and hormones trigger the ingestion of caecotrophs from the anus (Fekete, 1989). When food is scarce, all caecotrophs are consumed. When food is available ad libitum, the protein and fibre content of the ration influence the amount of caecotrophs consumed. Increased levels of fibre increase caecotrophy, whereas high protein levels reduce it.Key Points 1.4Gut physiology\n\u2022The gastrointestinal system of the rabbit is adapted for the digestion of large quantities of fibrous food.\u2022Rabbits are hindgut fermenters with a large caecum that periodically expels its contents into the colon. Microbial fermentation in the caecum results in the formation of a soft paste containing amino acids, volatile fatty acids, micro-organisms and vitamins.\u2022Mucus-encapsulated pellets of the soft caecal material or \u2018caecotrophs\u2019 are ingested as they emerge from the anus and subsequently digested to supply an additional source of nutrients. This process is known as caecotrophy\u2022Digestion in the stomach and small intestine is similar to other monogastric animals.\u2022The colon of the rabbit is adapted to mix and separate large indigestible fibre particles from small digestible fragments and fluid.\u2022The indigestible and digestible fibre components of the diet are simultaneously propelled in opposite directions in the proximal colon.\u2022Periodically, the pattern of motility in the large intestine and caecum changes completely to expel caecal contents as caecotrophs.\u2022A specially adapted area of the colon, the fusus coli, acts as a pacemaker to control colonic motility. The fusus coli is highly innervated and vascular and is influenced by blood metabolites and hormones such as prostaglandins and aldosterone.\u2022Small particles and fluid are directed in a retrograde direction from the proximal colon to the large caecum where bacterial fermentation takes place. Volatile fatty acids are the products of bacterial fermentation.\u2022The substrate for caecal fermentation is composed of undigested food that reaches the colon plus excretion products, and substances such as mucopolysaccharides and desquamated cells from the digestive tract.\u2022Urea can diffuse into the caecum from the bloodstream to act as a nitrogen source for the caecal bacteria.\u2022The population of micro-organisms within the caecum is finely balanced and changes with the time of day, caecal pH and dietary substrate.\u2022Long particles of undigested fibre are propelled through the distal colon and expelled as hard faeces. Absorption and secretion of water, electrolytes and volatile fatty acids in the large intestine alter according to the type of faeces passing through.\u2022Indigestible fibre stimulates intestinal motility.\n\n",

Volatile fatty acids absorbed from intestinal tract provide a regular energy source for the rabbit. Lactate enters the portal circulation from the stomach and small intestine while volatile fatty acids originate from the hindgut. Net absorption from the digestive tract is greatest during the hard faeces phase, which is matched by increased hepatic metabolism and the removal of propionate and butyrate from the circulation, leaving acetate and lactate available for extra-hepatic tissue metabolism (Caraba\u00f1o and Piquer, 1998). Due to alterations in hepatic metabolism, arterial concentrations of volatile fatty acids remain constant during both hard and soft phases of excretion, although their absorption and metabolism follow a circadian rhythm parallel to the activity of the adrenal gland (Vernay, 1987).",

It is characterized by total serum calcium concentrations that vary over a wide range and are 30\u201350% higher than other mammalian species (Buss and Bourdeau, 1984). Total serum calcium concentrations reflect dietary calcium intake (Chapin and Smith, 1967a, Chapin and Smith, 1967b). Hypocalcaemia is rare, although lactation tetany can occur in nursing does (Barlet, 1980). Experimentally, hypocalcaemic tetany can be induced by parathyroidectomy (Tan et al., 1987) or by feeding diets deficient in calcium or vitamin D (Bourdeau et al., 1986, Chapin and Smith, 1967a).Key Points 1.5Basic calcium and phosphorus physiology\n\u2022Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted in response to low calcium. Increased phosphorus has no direct effect on PTH, but increased P can reduce Ca2 +, thereby stimulating PTH release.\u2022PTH increases serum calcium and decreases serum phosphorus and increases phosphorus excretion by the kidney.\u2022PTH causes:1.Calcium release from bone2.Phosphorus excretion by the kidney3.Accelerated formation of active vitamin D in the kidney4.Calcium absorption from the gut5.Calcium reabsorption by the renal tubules.\n\u2022The blood calcium level at which PTH release is stimulated in rabbits is higher than in other species.\u2022Calcitonin is produced by the thyroid parafollicular cells in response to hypercalcaemia.\u2022Calcitonin decreases serum calcium and phosphorus.1.Inhibits PTH-stimulated bone resorption2.Increases phosphorus excretion by the kidney.\n\u2022Active vitamin D: formation occurs in the kidney under regulation of PTH.\u20221,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol is the metabolically active form of vitamin D.1.It promotes calcium and phosphorus absorption by the intestinal mucosa.2.It may facilitate PTH action on bone.3.Epithelial calcium transport channels are present in vitamin D-responsive tissues (Hoenderop et al., 2000).\n\u2022Only ionized calcium is biologically active.1.Alkalosis decreases serum ionized calcium concentration.2.Acidosis increases serum ionized calcium concentration: in rabbits this manifests as reduced calcium excretion through the kidney and therefore clear urine.\n\u2022Phosphorus occurs in various ionic forms and functions with phosphoric acid as a buffer system in body fluids. But acid\u2013base balance is primarily measured via the bicarbonate buffering system as the phosphorus buffering system is largely intercellular.\u2022Serum phosphorus is largely regulated by the kidneys. Losses occur when the tubular reabsorption capacity is exceeded.1.PTH may enhance phosphaturia by reducing tubular reabsorption.2.Dietary intake may directly affect serum phosphorus concentration.3.Abnormal serum phosphorus concentration is caused by altered dietary concentrations, decreased renal excretion and hormonal imbalances.\n\n\n",

Their calcium metabolism has been studied extensively. Interestingly, blood phosphorus levels in the rabbit are tightly controlled and maintained at levels very similar to those of other species. This is a situation similar to that found in horses, who also have higher and more variable serum calcium levels than predicted while maintaining serum phosphorus levels analogous to those of other species and rigidly controlled. The relationship between calcium and phosphorus is well recognized, and it is difficult to look at calcium metabolism without considering that of phosphorus. Rabbits have evolved to live on pastures where calcium and phosphorus levels can vary widely over the year. In certain seasons rabbits must deal with high dietary calcium (typically during the summer) while over the winter, both calcium and phosphorus levels are very low. At times when dietary calcium is very low, rabbits rely on active calcium transport (vitamin D-dependent) in order to derive enough from the diet. When dietary phosphorus and hence blood levels are low, rabbits undergo significant calciuria as a mechanism for retaining phosphorus (Bourdeau et al., 1990, DePalo et al., 1988). In wild rabbits, dietary intake of calcium and phosphorus vary annually, and levels of both these nutrients are low in late winter/early spring, prior to the rapid pasture growth (Table 1.1\n).",

Reciprocal elevations in PTH or calcitonin in response to EDTA or calcium gluconate infusion indicates that these hormones regulate serum calcium concentrations in rabbits as in other species (Bourdeau et al., 1986, Warren et al., 1989). However, rabbits appear to differ from humans in the level at which serum ionized calcium is set to initiate a parathyroid hormone (PTH) response (Warren et al., 1989). This tends to maintain serum calcium at higher levels. The effect of this on serum phosphorus is that renal phosphorus excretion is initiated at higher calcium levels. The advantage of this is unknown; however, it is suggested that it is a mechanism for the rabbit to successfully cope with wide variations in dietary calcium and phosphorus. An analogy has been made with the syndrome of benign familial hypercalcaemia in humans, which is a genetic condition characterized by hypercalcaemia without changes in renal function, blood pressure or any other potential sequels to chronic hypercalcaemia such as soft tissue mineralization.",

Active transportation involves a carrier protein that is synthesized in the intestinal mucosa in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the active metabolite of vitamin D. A drop in serum calcium concentration stimulates PTH release, which, in turn, stimulates the conversion of biologically inert 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the kidney, thereby indirectly increasing the absorption of calcium from the intestine (Chapin and Smith, 1967a).",

Caecal contents are expelled periodically as mucusencapsulated caecotrophs that are re-ingested and digested as a source of amino acids and vitamins.

Large-scale rabbit production has led to the development of pelleted foods of known analysis suitable for commercial rabbits. The nutritional requirements for pregnancy, lactation, growth and fur production have been well researched but the requirements for long-term maintenance of unproductive rabbits has been overlooked.

The visual appearance of food influences the owner when choosing a product, so pelleted diets became unpopular and a wide range of visually attractive, highly coloured cereal mixes evolved as \u2018rabbit food\u2019 in the UK. These diets are cheap to produce and many are put together by food compounders that normally make rations for farm animals. The choice of ingredients is based on general nutritional principles combined with cost and availability of ingredients. Scientific, long-term feeding trials are not carried out. The nutrient value, vitamin and mineral content of a diet is calculated by extrapolating figures taken from data tables of ingredients rather than analysing the food itself. In recent years, however, several companies have started to produce scientifically formulated mono-component pelleted and extruded feeds. These have been based on research and feeding trials and are nutritionally superior to many of the \u2018muesli\u2019-type mixes. The advantage of these types of premium feeds are a reduction in the likelihood of nutrient deficiency; the disadvantage is the way that many of these pellets need to be chewed (a more vertical chewing motion, compared with the more lateral movement seen when a rabbit chews hay or vegetation) that can lead to dental problems. A good compromise is to feed ad lib hay and a small amount of good-quality pellets and to offer a selection of fresh vegetables daily. The Rabbit Welfare Association and the RSPCA support this recommendation. A hay and fresh food-only diet, which is as close to the natural diet as possible, should be viewed as the optimum; however, many owners can\u2019t or won\u2019t comply with this.",

Dryness of the mouth and contractions of the stomach stimulate eating (Fekete, 1989). The volume of food eaten is influenced by its composition and texture and by the individual likes and dislikes of the rabbit. Increasing the fibre content of the diet increases the total volume consumed (Bellier and Gidenne, 1996). Rabbits will eat a variety of foods but show a preference for fibre and may eat hay or straw in preference to their compound feed. It can be difficult to persuade rabbits to eat new foods once they have become accustomed to a particular diet. New batches of food may be refused despite it appearing to the owner to be exactly the same. Sweet foods are generally palatable. Molasses are used in many commercial rabbit foods to improve palatability (Cheeke, 1994). Bitter tastes such as the saponins in alfalfa are well tolerated (Cheeke, 1987). Foods that are palatable without the addition of simple sugars are preferable.",

Biscuits or hard pieces of breakfast cereal are accepted readily. Bark is stripped from young trees or shrubs. All parts of the plant may be eaten including the stem and roots, although the growing tips are usually nibbled off first. Tree leaves are eaten, especially in the autumn when the leaves fall.Box 1.7Feeding recommendations for pet rabbits\n\u2022Introduce new foods gradually.\u2022Good-quality hay or grass should be available at all times, unless a complete diet is provided that specifically states that no other food is needed. Even with a complete diet, additional hay, grass or vegetables will not be harmful.\u2022Feed a wide range of green foods and vegetables every day. Fruit and succulent vegetables such as tomatoes should be given in moderation.\u2022Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions when feeding proprietary rabbit food. If the rabbit does not eat all the mixture, change the diet.\u2022If possible, allow rabbits outside to exercise in natural daylight. Care is needed to prevent them escaping or being predated. Rabbits can be very destructive in the garden.\u2022Feed small amounts of concentrated food, such as pellets, cereal mixes or extruded diets, only once a day and remove the bowl after a couple of hours. If there is food left in the bowl, feed less food the next day. Hay or grass is available if the rabbit feels hungry.\u2022No more than 2\u20133% of the rabbit\u2019s bodyweight of cereal mixes, pelleted or extruded rations should be fed daily.\nSafe plants for rabbits\n\u2022Grass of any type is safe, palatable and ideal for rabbits. Vaccination against viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) is advisable due to the risk of transmission from wild rabbits/hares.\u2022Wild plants that are safe include agrimony, brambles, chickweed, clover, coltsfoot, cow parsnip (hogweed), dandelion, young docks, goosegrass, ground elder, groundsel, knapweed, mallow, mayweed, plantain, raspberry, sea beet, shepherd\u2019s purse, sow-thistle, trefoil, vetch, wild strawberry and yarrow. (NB: Many of these plants are illustrated in Virginia Richardson\u2019s book Rabbit Nutrition.)\u2022Safe cultivated plants include artichoke leaves, apple, beetroot, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, carrots and carrot tops, celery, cauliflower leaves, chicory, coriander, corncobs, green beans, kale, kohl rabi, lettuce (in moderation), parsley, peapods, pear, parsnip, radish, spinach, spring greens (spring cabbage), sprout peelings, sunflower plants, swedes, sweetcorn plants, turnips and watercress. Turnips and spinach should be fed occasionally (not more than once a week) due to their oxalate content.\u2022Tree leaves can be eaten by rabbits, especially from fruit trees and hazel.\n",

The activity of amylase in the stomach is limited by the gastric pH, and at pH < 3.2 there is little or no amylase activity (Blas and Gidenne, 1998).

For example, cereal starches are more fermentable than those found in roots or tubers. Starch is found in plants as granules that are insoluble in cold water, but when a suspension of starch in water is heated, the granules swell and eventually gelatinize. Gelatinized starches can form complexes with proteins that reduce the digestibility of both starch and protein (Cheeke, 1987). Feed manufacturing processes and exogenous enzyme supplements also affect starch digestibility (Blas and Gidenne, 1998). Pancreatic amylase is the most important enzyme, and as dietary levels of starch increase, more amylase is secreted. Most starch is broken down into glucose and directly absorbed. Starch that is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine passes into the caecum as a substrate for bacterial fermentation.",

Excess starch reaching the caecum or \u2018carbohydrate overload\u2019 is thought to be a predisposing factor in the development of enterotoxaemia in young rabbits. Clostridium spiroforme requires glucose as a substrate for iota toxin production and glucose is yielded during bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate (Cheeke, 1987). In commercial units, enterotoxaemia is seen in young rabbits in association with high carbohydrate, low fibre diets. However, the situation is different in the adult pet rabbit where the sensitivity to high starch diets is controversial (Lowe, 1998). Recent work has indicated that there is a difference in starch digestibility between young and adult rabbits. Adult rabbits appear to digest starch more efficiently than young ones. Very small amounts of starch reach the caecocolic segment of adults. Even in lactating rabbits that consume high quantities of carbohydrate, almost all the starch is hydrolysed before it reaches the caecum (Blas and Gidenne, 1998). Therefore the role of starch as a predisposing factor for imbalances of the caecal microflora and the development of enteric disorders remains unclear. Experimental work has given conflicting results (Blas and Gidenne, 1998, Cheeke, 1987). However, the general consensus of opinion is that overload of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates in the large intestine increases the likelihood of digestive disorders, at least in susceptible, recently weaned rabbits. Dietary starch has no influence on the chemical composition of caecal contents or on the production or composition of soft and hard faeces (Caraba\u00f1o et al., 1988).",

Fibre is defined as \u2018that portion of ingested foodstuffs that cannot be broken down by intestinal enzymes and juices of monogastric animals and therefore passes through the small intestine and colon undigested\u2019 (Blood and Studdert, 1999). This definition is confusing in ruminants and hindgut fermenters because the gut flora breaks down and \u2018digests\u2019 some fibre molecules by microbial fermentation. Therefore, in herbivores, fibre can be either \u2018digestible\u2019 or \u2018indigestible\u2019 and digestibility varies with species and their digestive physiology. The term \u2018fermentable\u2019 fibre can also be used to describe digestible fibre that is broken down by microbial fermentation. In rabbits, fibre is separated in the proximal colon into large and small particles. Particles larger than 0.5 mm do not enter the caecum and are swiftly expelled undigested. This is the indigestible fibre component of the diet. Particles smaller than 0.3 mm are moved into the caecum where they are digested by bacterial fermentation. This component of the diet is known as digestible or fermentable fibre. Within the caecum the digestibility of fibre depends on the chemical composition and size of the particle. The ease with which bacteria can degrade fibre particles depends on the molecular structure and chemical properties of the fibre and the surface area to which the bacteria can adhere.Box 1.2The importance of dietary fibre to rabbitsDietary fibre can be divided into indigestible fibre that passes straight through the alimentary tract without entering the caecum and fermentable (digestible) fibre that is directed into the caecum and provides a substrate for bacterial degradation and fermentation by the caecal microflora.Indigestible fibre is important to:\u2022Stimulate gut motility that moves digesta and fluid into the caecum for fermentation.\u2022Provide forage material to prevent boredom and behavioural problems such as fur chewing.\u2022Provide dental exercise and optimal dental wear.\u2022Stimulate appetite and ingestion of caecotrophs.\nFermentable fibre is important to:\u2022Provide a substrate for caecal microflora.\u2022Provide optimal caecal pH and volatile fatty acid production.\u2022Prevent proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in the caecum.\u2022Increase fibre content of caecotrophs so they are of firm consistency.\n",

However, most digestion of fibre takes place by the microbial flora within the caecum. Digestibility within the caecum depends on the nature of the plant material and, to a lesser extent, processing procedures. Hemicelluloses and pectins are broken down more easily than cellulose, which requires degradation by cellulolytic bacteria and requires time for attachment of the bacteria to the cell wall before degradation starts. Degradation of cellulose takes longer than hemicellulose because of its linear polymer structure (Gidenne et al., 1998), so it is less fermentable than hemicellulose. Cellulose can be closely associated, both chemically and physically, with other compounds such as hemicellulose and pectin and affect their digestibility. It can also be combined with lignin. The digestibility of fibre within the caecum affects the rabbit\u2019s appetite and growth rate. Grinding down lignin so that it passes into the caecum depresses voluntary food intake in comparison with cellulose that is more fermentable (Chiou et al., 1998).",

Grinding down lignin to small particles causes it to be retained in the caecum where it cannot be digested. The degree of grinding is an important consideration as it alters the way in which fibre is separated in the proximal colon. Grinding fibre to particles small enough to be moved into the caecum rather than colon detracts from the beneficial effect of indigestible fibre on intestinal motility. There is general agreement that screen sizes for production of complete compound feeds should be 2 mm. Screen sizes of 1 mm induce digestive upsets (Lowe, 1998).",

A diet deficient in fibrous material has been implicated in cheek tooth overgrowth (Crossley, 1995). Diets low in indigestible fibre predispose to gastrointestinal hypomotility and the retention of food and hair in the stomach, which forms trichobezoars (hairballs). Slow gut motility and increased food retention time in the hindgut can result in alterations in gut flora and the development of enterotoxaemia. The provision of a diet high in indigestible fibre to house rabbits reduces the ingestion of non-food items such as carpet fibres or plastic litter trays. Fur chewing and barbering is also linked to low fibre diets (Quesenberry, 1994). Diets containing low dietary fibre depress voluntary food intake (Bellier and Gidenne, 1996).",

The fibre must be processed in some way to incorporate it into the food, which can affect its digestibility and its effect on gut motility. Grass and hay are good sources of fermentable and indigestible fibre for rabbits. Hay can be provided in addition to, or instead of, grass. It is not only a source of fibre but also enriches the environment and prevents abnormal behaviour (Berthelsen and Hansen, 1999). Alfalfa is a source of fibre used in commercial rabbit diets in many countries. Alfalfa hay not only provides fibre but also has a high calcium content. Alfalfa hay is now commonly available in the UK. Meadow hay suitable for feeding to pet rabbits is available from most pet shops. Meadow hay is preferable to alfalfa for pet rabbits. Fresh grass is the ideal food and rabbits have evolved to live on it. Garden weeds are also a source of fibre and give variety to the diet. Pet rabbits that are allowed free access to a garden will browse on a selection of plants. They have their own individual likes and dislikes and will eat tough fibrous vegetation as well as soft new shoots. Tree leaves are eaten, especially in the autumn when the leaves have fallen and are within easy reach. Leaves from apple and hazel are especially enjoyed by rabbits (Richardson, 1999). Bark may be stripped from branches and from the base of trees. Exposed roots may be chewed through. Young docks, brambles, raspberry leaves, sow thistle, chickweed, groundsel, dandelions, clover, plantain, goose grass, ground elder and vetches are among a host of plants enjoyed by pet rabbits. Annual bedding plants, herbs and other decorative garden shrubs will also be enjoyed and destroyed by a rabbit that is given the run of the garden. These can provide a good source of nutrition as well as environmental enrichment; however, where damage to these plants would prove upsetting, garden access should be supervised.",

Oligosaccharides can be classified as \u2018soluble fibre\u2019 as they are water soluble. The type of oligosaccharide is important in its effect upon the microbial population. A diet containing gluco-oligosaccharides that release glucose after hydrolysis in the caecum causes diarrhoea in young rabbits, whereas fructo- or galacto-oligosaccharides do not have the same effect (Lebas et al., 1998). Currently, there is considerable interest in fructo-oligosaccharides because they are reputed to be beneficial in the human gastrointestinal tract by providing the correct substrate for the proliferation of desirable bacterial species such as bifidobacteria (Campbell et al., 1997). Certain plants such as chicory, asparagus, bananas and artichokes contain fructo-oligosaccharides that stimulate the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. in the human colon: hence the term \u2018bifidogenesis\u2019, which may be used to describe this effect. Fructo-oligosaccharides have been called \u2018prebiotics\u2019, as the principle of their beneficial effects is similar to probiotics, i.e. to encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibit pathogenic species. Fructo-oligosaccharides are utilized by Bacteroides spp. that prevail in healthy caecal microflora of rabbits. Fructo-oligosaccharides increase calcium, magnesium and iron absorption from the colon and rectum of rats (Ohta et al., 1995a, Ohta et al., 1995b) and reduce serum triglyceridaemia in humans (Roberfroid, 1997). In rabbits, a reduction in morbidity after the introduction of pathogenic E. coli has been reported in rabbits fed on a fructo-oligosaccharide-supplemented diet (Maertens and Villamide, 1998). Fructo-oligosaccharides are now included in many proprietary rabbit foods.",

For example, methionine can be replaced by cystine, and tyrosine can partly replace phenylalanine. Although rabbits have an essential amino acid requirement (see Box 1.3\n), the situation is complicated by caecotrophy. Micro-organisms within the caecum synthesize amino acids that are absorbed from the caecotroph during digestion.

Further conversion to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) takes place before it is transported to the liver, bound to plasma protein. Plants contain a different vitamin D precursor, ergosterol, which is also converted by ultraviolet light to produce ergocalciferol or vitamin D2. This process takes place in the plant when vegetation, such as hay, dries in the sunshine. Ergocalciferol is transported, protein bound, from the gut to the liver where, like vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), it is hydroxylated to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D), which is, in turn, converted to the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D) in the kidney. Conversion of 25-OH-D to 1,25(OH)2D is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) released from the parathyroid gland in response to low serum calcium concentrations.",

High quantities of vitamin D causes bone resorption and raise blood calcium levels. Low quantities of vitamin D reduce intestinal absorption and renal conservation of calcium and result in a drop in blood calcium, which stimulates PTH release. PTH stimulates bone resorption to release calcium and restore blood levels. Therefore, osteomalacia can result from both deficiency and excess of vitamin D.

Instead, vitamin D must be metabolized endogenously or obtained from a dietary source such as sundried vegetation or a vitamin supplement. Irradiated plant sterols with anti-rachitic potency occur in the dead leaves of plants or sun-cured hays rather than in the green leaves of growing plants. Therefore vitamin D content of the natural diet increases when potential for endogenous synthesis is reduced. Variation in the vitamin D content of hay can occur with different methods of curing. Exposure to irradiation by sunlight for long periods causes a marked increase in anti-rachitic potency of cut fodder, whereas modern haymaking techniques with its emphasis on rapid curing tends to keep vitamin D levels at a minimum (Blood et al., 1979). Rabbits enjoy eating dried vegetation such as fallen tree leaves in the autumn and will often eat them in preference to the grass available at that time. This is where they get oral vitamin D intake in the wild. There is also an interaction between vitamin A and vitamin D. Vitamin A appears to intensify the severity of rickets and inhibit the ability of vitamin D to cure the disease. Vitamin A administration to rats produced a decrease in total bone ash, increased the epiphyseal bone width and eliminated the ability of vitamin D to elevate serum calcium levels in a study by Rohde et al.

The diet of the farmed rabbits contained 2200 IU/kg of vitamin D; yet PTH and serum total and ionized calcium values were not statistically different from the laboratory rabbits. Vitamin D toxicity has caused soft tissue mineralization in rabbits that were erroneously fed excessive quantities of supplement (Zimmerman et al., 1990). Dietary levels above 2300 IU/kg appear to be toxic (Cheeke, 1987). A level of 800\u20131200 IU/kg is recommended for pet rabbits (Lowe, 1998).

Choline, folate, biotin, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine pantothenic acid and vitamin B12 make up this group. Caecotrophs are a rich source of the B vitamins niacin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid and vitamin B12. Primary deficiencies of these vitamins are unlikely to occur in rabbits, as most diets contain sufficient quantities, in addition to the amounts synthesized by the caecal flora. Niacin and choline deficiencies have been induced under experimental conditions. Unlike other B vitamins, choline must be synthesized in the liver, and a deficiency can contribute to hepatic lipidosis and necrosis (Mateos and de Blas, 1998). In cases of reduced liver function it may be sensible to consider supplementation. Vitamin B12 requires cobalt, which could be a limiting factor in the diet.",

It is required for the maintenance and repair of connective tissue, and plays a protective role in many oxidative biochemical processes. Ascorbic acid is stored in tissues with high metabolic activity such as adrenal glands, hypophysis and leucocytes (Verde and Piquer, 1986). Rabbits can synthesize vitamin C. However, there is evidence that the vitamin C requirements of rabbits increase during periods of stress (for example, overheating, transport, subclinical disease) when plasma ascorbic acid has been shown to decrease significantly as synthesis does not match demand (Verde and Piquer, 1986). Under these conditions supplementation may be useful (Mateos and de Blas, 1998). Administration of vitamin C in conjunction with vitamin E prevented an increase in liver enzymes in rabbits experimentally infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Umar et al., 1999) and an improved reproductive performance in rabbits under heat stress (Ismail et al., 1992).Key Points 1.7Vitamin requirements\n\u2022Intercurrent disease such as coccidiosis increases the requirement for vitamins such as A or E.\u2022Vitamin A deficiency can occur in housed rabbits on cereal diets and poor-quality hay; 500\u2013100 IU/kg can be given as a single dose for hypovitaminosis A.\u2022In most species, vitamin D is required for active transport of calcium from the gut to the bloodstream but in rabbits with sufficient dietary concentrations, calcium is absorbed efficiently and passively from the gut in the absence of vitamin D.\u2022Passive calcium absorption is dependent on a diffusion gradient across the gut wall. Low dietary calcium results in a lower gradient and less absorption.\u2022In rabbits, the regulatory role of vitamin D is due to its interaction with PTH and its effects on renal excretion and conservation of calcium.\u2022If dietary calcium is low, active vitamin D-dependent calcium absorption may be required because the passive diffusion gradient is low.\u2022Vitamin D-deficient young rabbits can develop rickets and adults develop osteomalacia.\u2022Sunlight is required for endogenous vitamin D synthesis; however, vitamin D can also be absorbed orally.\u2022Undetectable vitamin D levels have been found in pet rabbits.\u2022Chronically vitamin D-deficient rabbits were studied (fed on a diet containing 1% calcium). Findings included that mild hypocalcaemia and moderate hypophosphataemia occurred, with increased PTH levels. There was no difference in gut absorption of calcium in deficient and vitamin D supplemented groups. But significant retention of both calcium and phosphorus occurred in the kidney, meaning that the net balance for each mineral was more positive in vitamin D-deficient animals (Bourdeau et al., 1986).\u2022Cereal mixes contain supplements that contain calcium and vitamin D. Rabbits that selectively feed may leave the portion of the diet containing the vitamin and mineral supplement uneaten. Pelleted and extruded monocomponent diets are also supplemented and selective feeding can be avoided.\u2022Vitamin D can be obtained in the diet from sun-dried vegetation such as hay. Modern techniques can dry hay without the need for sunshine and, therefore, hay may be vitamin D deficient\u2022Vitamin D toxicity has been recorded in rabbits and causes mineralization of soft tissues, especially the kidneys and aorta.\u2022Rabbits can synthesize vitamin C but requirements vary.\u2022Caecotrophy provides a source of vitamins B and K.\n\n",

It is an important cation in intracellular and extracellular fluid and is essential for blood clotting, muscle contractions, nerve cell activity, hormone regulation and the maintenance and stability of cell membranes. Rabbits require a constant supply of calcium for their teeth that continually erupt at a rate of approximately 2 mm per week. Calcium metabolism and its unusual aspects in rabbits are discussed in Section 1.3.12 and Key Points 1.6. Briefly, rabbits absorb calcium readily from the diet and do not homeostatically maintain blood levels as closely as other species. Total serum calcium levels vary across a wide range and are higher than in other mammals. Increased dietary calcium levels bring about an increase in serum calcium (Chapin and Smith, 1967a), which is excreted in the urine in the form of calcium carbonate, which gives the urine a thick creamy appearance (Cheeke and Amberg, 1973). Urinary calcium levels are also related to dietary calcium intake (Kennedy, 1965).",

In the rabbit, the main mechanism of calcium absorption appears to be passive diffusion, although active transport is important if dietary levels are low. Passive diffusion is bidirectional and depends on the concentration gradient between the intestinal lumen and the blood. Calcium is absorbed primarily in its ionic form and compounds that bind with calcium to form insoluble complexes reduce its availability, e.g., oxalates (Breslau, 1996). The solubility of minerals such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus in intestinal contents is affected by pH. For example, calcium absorption is increased in horses fed a high fibre diet due to lower stomach pH and increased saliva and pancreatic secretions that increase the solubility of calcium in the gut (Meyer et al., 1992). It is not known whether an analogous situation exists in the rabbit. Phytates, oxalates and acetates form complexes with calcium and other minerals and can prevent absorption (Fowler, 1986). Phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphoric) is present in high quantities in grains and beans. Oxalates are present in a number of plants including swede, spinach and alfalfa in which 20\u201330% of the calcium is in the form of calcium oxalate that reduces its availability. In a study by Cheeke et al. (1985), 49% of the calcium in calcium oxalate was available to rabbits. Low oxalate, high calcium vegetables include kale, broccoli, turnip, collard and mustard greens (Breslau, 1996). Calcium can also bind with long-chain unsaturated fatty acids in the intestine to form insoluble soaps.",

Rapid drying techniques using field machinery and barn drying equipment have recently been introduced to overcome some of the problems associated with unpredictable weather. The aim of haymaking is to reduce the moisture content of the green crop to a level low enough to inhibit the action of plant and microbial enzymes. Valuable nutrients are lost during the drying process due to the action of enzymes, oxidation, leaching and mechanical damage. The vitamin content of hay depends on the manner in which it was dried and the length of exposure to sunlight. Prolonged exposure to sunlight increases the vitamin D content, whereas rapid drying preserves the vitamin A content. Increased drying time allows bacterial fermentation to take place and rain on a partly dried crop leaches out minerals and encourages the growth of moulds (McDonald et al., 1996).

The drying process can affect the vitamin D content. Dried alfalfa is approximately 25% crude fibre and is also rich in protein, calcium and vitamin A. It is high in oxalate that binds with calcium in the gut and affects absorption. Alfalfa can easily be grown under dry conditions and has proven to be a useful feed for rabbits in many parts of the world. In the UK, alfalfa is recognized as a useful foodstuff for rabbits,and is increasingly used as a source of both fibre and calcium in many proprietary foods. In tandem with the increased interest in lower calcium manufactured foods, there has been a backlash against alfalfa within the rabbit community, making it less popular as an ingredient, due to its high calcium levels and many rabbit owners are now very aware that alfalfa hay is not an appropriate feedstuff. Some breeders use a high fibre horse food made from alfalfa to feed to rabbits. Alfalfa is retained in the digestive tract for longer than plain cellulose, suggesting that it is digested to some degree in the caecum (Chiou et al., 1998).",

Apart from the general problems associated with feeding ad lib concentrated foods (obesity, insufficient dietary fibre, dental exercise and foraging), mixed cereal rations have the additional disadvantage of allowing rabbits to select out their favourite ingredients and leave the rest uneaten (see Figure 1.8). Discarded food is generally taken away by the owner and replaced with a fresh bowlful for the rabbit to select from. Owners worry about their pets being bored or hungry and sometimes refill the bowl several times a day so the rabbit may exist on only one or two favourite ingredients. In order to be nutritionally balanced, this type of food must be fed full to empty bowl. The pellets, which contain the vitamin and mineral supplement, are often left uneaten. The most palatable portions of these diets are the flaked peas and flaked maize which are deficient in calcium and have a low calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. Selection of these ingredients results in a diet with calcium concentrations below the rabbit\u2019s known dietary requirement (Harcourt-Brown, 1996). Demineralization of the bones and teeth results in dental problems (see Section 5.5.1.1). A balanced diet is especially important to juvenile rabbits that are growing rapidly and therefore susceptible to metabolic bone disease. Selection of low calcium cereals and legumes from mixed rations at this stage can have life-long detrimental effects on bones and teeth.Key Points 1.9Common feeds and ingredients\n\u2022Grass is a balanced source of vitamins, minerals and fermentable (digestible) and indigestible fibre for rabbits.\u2022The digestibility of the species of grasses found in UK pastures are similar, although timothy (Phleum pratense) has a slightly higher crude fibre and lower protein content.\u2022Alfalfa (lucerne, Medicago sativa) is used for grazing and haymaking in warm countries, although it is now available in the UK.\u2022Alfalfa has a high fibre and calcium content.\u2022Infections may be transmitted to pet rabbits from hay that has been contaminated by vermin (VHD and Baylisascariasis).\u2022Seeds and stems of hay can become lodged in the eye, mouth, nose, nasopharynx or larynx and are an underdiagnosed cause of clinical disease.\u2022Commercial foods for rabbits are composed of pelleted, extruded or mixed rations.\u2022Pelleted diets consist of ingredients that have been ground and compressed.\u2022Extruded foods are ground, blended and cooked to form a lightweight biscuit that is sterile and palatable, and stores well.\u2022Mixed rations vary between sources and contain a range of ingredients including flaked, micronized, rolled or whole grains such as corn, wheat, oats and barley plus legumes such as peas and beans. Dried vegetables such as carrots and leeks may be added. Most mixed rations also contain pellets and/or extrusions.\u2022Mixed rations that are available in countries outside the UK contain other ingredients such as sunflower seeds, peanuts, corn kernels and dried peas.\n\n",

For example, nitrophenols, which are used as herbicides, fungicides or antisprouting agents on potatoes, can make the plants extremely toxic to rabbits (Lorgue et al., 1996). Ingestion of the toxin occurs by eating recently treated vegetation. The compounds stimulate tissue respiration while simultaneously impairing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Hyperthermia, methaemoglobinaemia, jaundice and pulmonary oedema are among the clinical signs. Ingestion of hay grown from a monoculture sprayed with a selective herbicide such as a triazine can cause poisoning. Treated, triazine-resistant weeds are dried and eaten in contaminated hay. Symptoms of poisoning in other species are non-specific and include anorexia, weight loss, depression, salivation, muscle atonia, weakness and paraplegia or hyperexcitability. Treatment is symptomatic and the prognosis generally good. Garden fungicides that are used to treat lawns also belong to the triazine group.

Many rabbits are finicky, even obese ones, and will steadfastly refuse to eat anything at all if they are not offered their favourite foods. Starvation quickly leads to hepatic lipidosis in obese rabbits. Care should be taken at the outset to ensure that the rabbit is actually eating its new diet and is passing hard faeces. Quantities of cereal mixtures or pellets should be reduced or phased out over a couple of weeks. Eventually a diet of ad lib hay or grass with no concentrates can be given until the rabbit has lost weight. Small amounts of vegetables can be given as treat foods. As much exercise as possible is important. The weight loss must be maintained in the long term, and a return to old feeding habits avoided. Most companies that manufacture rabbit food now produce \u2018light\u2019 or low calorie pellets as an alternative to their adult diets.Key Points 1.11Weight management in rabbits\n\u2022Obese rabbits have high resting heart rates and can develop hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. They are prone to developing fatal hepatic lipidosis if they become anorexic.\u2022High fibre diets that would result in weight loss in other species may not be effective in rabbits. Fibre is fermented by the caecal microflora to volatile fatty acids.\u2022Weight reduction can only be achieved in rabbits by providing a diet low in digestible fibre and high in indigestible fibre.\u2022Many rabbit food producers now have a low energy or diet formulation of their adult feeds.\u2022Increased amounts of exercise are an important part of a weight reduction programme.\u2022Rabbit weight loss clinics can be run in the surgery in much the same way as those for cats and dogs.\n\nKey Points 1.12Practical rabbit nutrition\n\u2022Pet rabbits should have access to ad lib hay. As a general rule an adult rabbit will eat a bundle of hay approximately the same size as its body every day.\u2022Pet rabbits should be offered fresh vegetables every day, a portion size approximately the same size as the rabbit's head is enough.\u2022A small amount of good-quality pellets can be offered twice daily (approximately a tablespoon per kg of rabbit per day).\u2022Incorrect feeding causes many diseases of pet rabbits.\u2022Owners are often confused by conflicting advice given by breeders, pet shops or food manufacturers. The advice may be based on anecdotal evidence, marketing material or data obtained from commercial production that is not relevant to the pet animal.\u2022Digestion of starch in the small intestine is affected by the age of the rabbit. Adults digest starch more efficiently than young animals. Undigested starch that reaches the caecum can act as a substrate for bacterial fermentation and predispose to the development of enterotoxaemia. It can also lead to uneaten caecotrophs.\u2022Fibre is important to maintain optimum digestion and a healthy caecal microflora. Digestible fibre provides a substrate for bacterial fermentation in the caecum. Indigestible fibre stimulates gut motility.\u2022The amount of indigestible fibre in the diet is very important. Too little results in reduced gastrointestinal motility and digestive disorders. Too much results in malnutrition.\u2022Grass and good-quality meadow hay are ideal sources of digestible and indigestible fibre. Wild plants and garden weeds are also good sources of fibre.\u2022It is possible to transmit infectious or parasitic disease from wild animals by feeding contaminated grass or hay.\u2022High levels of dietary protein are not necessary for pet rabbits although they do have an essential amino acid requirement.\n\n",

Dwarf breeds appear to be predisposed to developing incisor malocclusion. Giant breeds are more susceptible to cardiomyopathy and arthritic conditions. The giant English and French lops are prone to superficial pyoderma in the large skin folds that can develop under the chin and around the perineum. Entropion also occurs in these breeds. The thin fur on the hocks of rex rabbits makes them susceptible to developing sore hocks and the short maxilla and foreshortened face of the Netherland dwarf can alter the anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct so it is prone to blockage. Dwarf breeds appear to have a susceptibility to developing torticollis due to Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection (Kunstyr and Naumann, 1983).",

Conversely, food deprivation results in an increase in thirst, with rabbits drinking up to 650% more water (Brewer and Cruise, 1994).

Uneaten caecotrophs are sometimes seen as shiny clusters of dark pasty pellets in the bedding of normal animals. Uneaten caecotrophs are often interpreted as diarrhoea. This is not surprising as caecotrophs have a strong smell and a soft consistency in comparison with the hard faecal pellets. Obesity, spinal problems and dental disease are among the many reasons for caecotrophs to be left uneaten (see Figure 8.6). Uneaten caecotrophs can become entangled in the fur under the tail and form an unpleasant, malodorous faecal mass that in turn can lead to myiasis. Changes in the consistency of caecotrophs can follow ingestion of a new food or a succulent item such as lettuce or fruit. Soft, sticky or liquid caecotrophs may be passed. It is thought that this is due to alterations in the caecal microflora. Rabbits on a high fibre diet have a healthy caecal microflora that can withstand dietary changes. Uneaten caecotrophs are not life threatening although they are unpleasant for the owner and rabbit, and predispose to other conditions such as superficial pyoderma, fly strike and problems with urination due to inflamed painful perineal skin (see Sections 7.7.2, 8.6 and 12.4.3). Discrimination between uneaten caecotrophs and true diarrhoea is often possible by checking whether normal droppings are being passed concurrently. If they are, then the \u2018diarrhoea\u2019 noted is likely to be uneaten caecotrophs.",

The rabbit kidney is adapted for the excretion of large amounts of calcium (see Section 1.3.12). Intestinal absorption is related to the calcium content of the diet and excess amounts are excreted by the kidney. Therefore the amount of calcium carbonate precipitate varies with the calcium content of the diet. The hydration status of the animal and pH of the urine also affect the amount of precipitate. The urine can be clear during periods of high calcium demand such as growth, pregnancy or lactation. A small amount of precipitate is a good sign as it reflects adequate calcium content in the diet. Excessive precipitate can form a thick sludge, especially in the bladder of rabbits that do not urinate frequently (see Section 12.4). High dietary calcium levels exacerbate the problem. Cystitis, urethritis and urinary incontinence can be the result. It can be difficult to differentiate between normal calcium carbonate deposits and abnormal amounts of sludge. Normal rabbit urine is often radiopaque. Calcium carbonate deposits in the urine of an otherwise healthy animal with no sign of urinary tract disease do not require treatment; however, it should be recognized that if the situation changes the calcium deposits may become clinically significant. Similarly, triple phosphate crystals can be a normal finding in rabbit urine.",

Very excitable or aggressive rabbits can be caught and removed from the carrier in a towel. Picking rabbits up by their ears is not acceptable and is no longer advocated, although it is recommended in some older texts. After being removed from the carrier, it is often useful to allow the rabbit to hop around the floor of the consulting room as long as this is safe. In this way the rabbit can become acquainted with a new environment, and important information about its general condition and mobility can be gained. Alternatively the rabbit can be held on the consulting table and observed while a clinical history is being obtained from the owner. To examine the perineum, the rabbit can be restrained in dorsal recumbency either by holding the scruff and lying the rabbit on its back or by cradling it like a baby in the arms of an assistant or the owner. Dorsal recumbency may evoke an immobility response but can be a source of stress, leading to kicking and struggling.

A large towel is placed on the table and the rabbit placed on top of it before being wrapped up so the whole body is enclosed with only the head exposed. An assistant, who may be the owner, is needed to hold the rabbit firmly against them or pressed gently on to the table. The front legs can be held. Jackson (1991) found that restraining laboratory rabbits by wrapping them securely in a towel not only reduced the stress of handling but also reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal stasis. It is important to remember that rabbits can still cause themselves harm whilst wrapped in a towel, and isometric contraction of the powerful lumbar muscles can result in spinal fracture. Attention to the behaviour of the rabbit being examined and modification of approach if struggling occurs is less likely to result in injury to either handler or patient.Key Points 1.13Rabbit handling\n\u2022While most rabbits tolerate handling well, some respond by struggling and jumping. This can result in broken bones and teeth as well as injury to the handler.\u2022Rabbits have spinal muscles strong enough to break their own spines should they contract forcibly, for example when trying to kick out with their back legs. Isometric contraction of the spinal muscles can still result in significant spinal damage, for example when a struggling rabbit is wrapped in a towel.\u2022In the surgery setting, rabbits should be picked up from the carrier. In the home setting it is much less stressful for the rabbit to be approached from its own level.\u2022Rabbits should be picked up by placing a hand under their chest and using the other hand to support the back end of the body. For some aggressive rabbits it is necessary to pick them up using the scruff; however, it is still vitally important to support the body weight at the back end of the body.\u2022Rabbits should never be picked up by their ears\u2022Rabbits can often be examined using minimal restraint, and an owner or nurse simply gently holding the rabbit in place is enough. For rabbits that try to escape, covering their eyes with a hand is often helpful and calms them down enough for examination.\u2022For procedures that are intimidating (looking inside the mouth) or painful, using a towel to wrap the rabbit may be necessary. It is still possible for a rabbit to injure itself in this situation.\u2022Tonic immobility can be used as a means for restraining rabbits for portions of the clinical examination. Some rabbits are resistant to this technique and it is thought to be stressful.\u2022Ultimately some rabbits will benefit from sedation in order to allow complete examination. This is likely to be less stressful than the alternatives.\n\n",

On one hand, some practitioners lie rabbits on their backs to perform a variety of procedures such as nail clipping, oral administration of medicines and even inserting mouth gags to examine or clip molars. On the other hand, there is a view that the immobility response occurs in stressful situations and that rabbits lying on their backs are terrified and waiting to be eaten.

The more highly a species is preyed upon, the easier it is to induce the response. The immobility response is a transitory and reversible state of profound motor inhibition. The phenomenon is characterized by lack of spontaneous movement and failure to respond to external stimuli for several minutes. In rabbits, there is hypotonia of flexor and extensor musculature, abolition of the righting reflex, depression of spinal reflexes, miosis and a drop in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. An awareness of external stimuli is maintained, although there is a decreased response to noise and painful stimuli (Danneman et al., 1988). This trance-like state is induced in the laboratory by placing the rabbit in dorsal recumbency, covering its eyes with its ears and flexing its chin against the neck. The hind legs are stretched out for a few minutes before releasing the legs and gently stroking the chest and abdomen. As long as the head is flexed, the rabbit remains immobile and restraining devices have been designed to maintain this position (Bivin, 1994).",

The exact role of endogenous opioid systems is controversial and there are conflicting reports about the effects of naloxone which, theoretically, should prevent or reverse the hypnotic state (Danneman et al., 1988). Sudden noise or painful stimuli can interrupt the trance and there is considerable variation in individual susceptibility to the technique. In a study by Danneman et al. (1988), the immobility response could not be evoked in 25% of rabbits. In the consulting room, some pet rabbits can be calmed and restrained by placing them in dorsal or lateral recumbency and gently stroking their stomach while quietly speaking to them. Blowing gently on their face or stroking the bridge of the nose can also be effective.",

Fear behaviours were also noted in six rabbits who were tranced repeatedly (McBride et al., 2006). This supports the assertion that this phenomenon is indicative of a fear-motivated stress response (Day, 2004). It is therefore inappropriate to advocate the use of the immobility response in order to promote bonding between a rabbit and an owner; however, its use in veterinary practices in order to avoid unnecessary anaesthesia is justifiable.",

In trials conducted at the University of Edinburgh, the rib area proved to be the most useful for assessing body fat, with the hips and spine only showing appreciable changes at extremes of body weight. The ribs are felt just behind the elbow and the amount of pressure required to feel the ribs is assessed. The greater the pressure required, the more fat is present (Table 1.8\n).",

The response to pain is to become quiet, immobile and oblivious of the surroundings. Visceral problems such as gut stasis or urolithiasis appear to be more distressing to rabbits than the abscesses or fractures. Occasionally, overt signs of pain such as tooth grinding can be evident. This is usually associated with visceral pain, especially impactive intestinal problems such as mucoid enteropathy (see Section 8.9). Intestinal obstruction is associated with severe depression and immobility, which gives a characteristic clinical presentation (see Box 1.8\n). The presence of spurs on the molars that traumatize the sensitive mucosa of the tongue is also very painful for rabbits.Box 1.8Intestinal obstruction in pet rabbitsIntestinal obstruction in pet rabbits gives a characteristic clinical presentation. The most common cause of obstruction is a felt of hair that is groomed out of the coat, especially the hind feet, during moulting. Dried pulses, foreign objects, tumours and tapeworm cysts are among other causes of obstruction (see Chapter 8). If the condition is recognized early and surgery is performed promptly, there is a reasonable chance of success. If the condition is not recognized and treated, the rabbit will die unless the foreign body happens to pass into the colon.Presentation\n\u2022Sudden onset. The rabbit was well until a few hours before presentation.\u2022Severe mental depression. The rabbit is unresponsive and totally anorexic.\u2022Abdominal distension. The owners may have noticed a bloated appearance although it may be masked by a thick coat.\u2022Palpably distended stomach. A \u2018strange feeling\u2019 or distended abdomen or abdominal pain is a clear indication for abdominal radiography.\u2022Shock, dehydration and collapse. Depending on the site of the obstruction, the rabbit\u2019s condition will deteriorate rapidly.\nDiagnosis\n\u2022Abdominal radiographs are diagnostic. A stomach distended with gas and fluid is clearly visible (see Figure 8.5). A section of gas-filled intestine can usually be seen radiographically, proximal to the site of obstruction. If the obstruction moves into the colon, gas can be seen in the caecum and proximal colon.\u2022Other causes of gastric dilatation include mucoid enteropathy or dysautonomia, both of which carry a poor prognosis.\u2022Abdominal palpation. An impacted organ, intussusception or foreign body may be palpable, especially if the rabbit is anaesthetized or moribund.\u2022Prompt exploratory laparotomy is indicated.\nTreatment\n\u2022Motility stimulants are contraindicated prior to surgery. Postoperatively, metoclopramide (with caution) and ranitidine are required to prevent ileus. Cisapride may be used if available.\u2022Effective analgesia is important. Low dose fentanyl/fluanisone (Hypnorm, Janssen 0.2 mL/kg) provides analgesia, sedation and vasodilation that facilitates intravenous fluid therapy.\u2022Decompress the stomach by passing a stomach tube (a stomach tube should remain in place throughout surgery). This can usually be done after the rabbit has been sedated.\u2022Fluid therapy. Intravenous (or intraosseous) fluid therapy is essential. Subcutaneous fluids will be ineffective in restoring and maintaining blood pressure and correcting dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\u2022Anaesthesia, gradual mask induction with isoflurane is recommended. Anaesthesia and perioperative care are described in Chapter 4.\u2022Enterotomy. Midline incision. The obstruction is often easy to find. The gas-filled small intestine can usually be identified and followed to the site of the obstruction. (Basic surgical principles in rabbits are described in Chapter 13.) Fine suture material (5/0 or 6/0 PDS or Monocryl) is required to repair the intestinal incision. A set of fine instruments is essential (a detailed description of surgical procedure is given in Chapter 8).\n",

The epiphyses of the lumbar vertebrae close much later. Counting the adhesion lines in the periosteal zone of the mandible by histopathological examination can be used to age mature rabbits accurately (Henderson and Bowen, 1979) but this is not possible during life. The deciduous teeth are shed at birth and so the only criteria to make an assessment of age during clinical examination are the size and appearance of the rabbit, both of which vary according to breed and state of health and experience. The claws of the rabbit do not project beyond the fur until the rabbit reaches maturity (Sandford, 1996), but this age varies according to breed and size. Fanciers may be able to give an indication of age by feeling the ears, which are soft in young rabbits and become tougher with age (Sandford, 1996). Pedigree rabbits may have rings over their hocks on which the year of birth will be recorded. Smaller breeds mature at 4\u20135 months of age and the larger breeds mature at 5\u20138 months (Donnelly, 1997). Bucks reach puberty later than does, so immature females housed with their brothers are unlikely to conceive even though the buck may mount and appear to mate her.

There are many clinical conditions that can prevent a rabbit from licking and grooming properly (see Figure 1.9), which are manifested by a dull coat full of dead hair and skin debris. Combing through the fur with a flea comb gives an idea of the amount of dead hair and debris and also reveals the presence of fleas, flea dirt or mites. Mites can just be seen with the naked eye, especially under good illumination. A magnifying glass can be used to examine the fur thoroughly. Microscopic examination of skin brushings or sellotape strips confirms their presence and gives an idea of numbers. Most rabbits have some degree of infestation, which is not always significant; however, extensive infestation can be a sign that something is causing stress to the animal or preventing grooming (see Section 7.14.2). The areas of skin between the shoulder blades and above the base of the tail are difficult for the rabbit to reach and groom, especially if it obese or has limited flexibility due to spondylosis (see Figure 1.19). Cheyletiellosis often starts to become evident on the back of the neck and along the dorsum. During the summer, soiled fur at the base of the tail or the perineum must be examined closely for the presence of maggots. The area under the dewlap is prone to superficial pyoderma, predisposed by factors such as poor hygiene, dental disease or obesity. Some rabbits are unable to drink without immersing their dewlap in the water bowl, leading to wet macerated skin and dermatitis or myiasis. Excess salivation as a result of dental disease can result in a wet dewlap that is prone to bacterial infection. Fat rabbits with excessive skin folds and large dewlaps experience problems grooming and may lick the cranial surface of the dewlap obsessively as a type of displacement activity because they cannot groom other areas such as the underside of the dewlap or the perineum which is infected, inflamed and sore. Steatitis within the fat of the dewlap can also lead to chronic skin mutilation. This can be the result of previous trauma.",

Pain caused by infected, inflamed perineal skin can lead to urine retention, urethritis, cystitis and/or urinary incontinence. Urine scalding can also be due to urogenital disease or indicative of other problems such as vertebral spondylitis, sore hocks or arthritis, which prevent the rabbit positioning itself correctly to urinate (see Section 12.4.3). Neurological deficits, abdominal pain or generalized weakness can also lead to urine scalding or perineal soiling. Skin inflammation in the perineal area may be caused by uneaten caecotrophs that have become adherent to the fur and caused superficial pyoderma of the skin beneath. Obesity, dental disease and arthritis prevent grooming around the perineum so the fur becomes matted, soiled and infected. This starts a vicious circle that can be broken by clipping and cleaning the perineal area and treating the painful dermatitis (see Figure 7.1 and Section 7.7.3). Clippers can be used to remove most of the fur. A sharp pair of curved, pointed scissors is useful for teasing out and cutting matted hair around the genitalia and under the tail. Dead and matted hair can be combed out with a flea comb. It is very easy inadvertently to damage the delicate skin. Patience and the correct equipment are required. Sedation may be needed.

Wax and debris may obscure the view, particularly in lop-eared breeds. The tragus, a blind-ending section of the external ear, must also be carefully examined. Pus is a relatively common finding in the external ears of pet rabbits. It may not be associated with inflammation or clinical signs.\u2022Examine the eyes and surrounding structures visually and using an ophthalmoscope. Schirmer tear tests, fluoroscein dyes and ultrasonography are useful adjuncts to basic examination.\u2022Palpate the skull, paying particular attention to the ventral mandibles and the zygomatic area. Gently manipulate the lower jaw to assess its range of motion.\u2022The incisors can be examined by moving the upper lips sideways and back. Make certain all teeth are present. Pay attention to the occlusion and evidence of damage to the tooth enamel surface.\u2022The cheek teeth can be examined using an otoscope. This is inserted into the rabbit\u2019s mouth via the diastema and is used to visualize the buccal, occlusal and lingual surfaces of the cheek teeth. The view is limited by the oral soft tissues, saliva and movements of the patient. It is a good initial examination tool but definitve oral examination must be undertaken with the rabbit anaesthetized.\n\n",

Evidence of previous lens rupture and cataract formation is associated with Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Local anaesthesia with topical proxymetacaine drops facilitates examination of the cornea and third eyelid. The application of fluorescein will reveal corneal ulceration. Fluoroscein can also be useful to evaluate the drainage of the tear duct. In a normal rabbit the dye will not overflow onto the face and should appear at the external nares within a minute or so of application (although it takes longer to appear than it does in dogs and cats). Where the tear duct is blocked the dye will flow onto the face and fail to appear at the ispsilateral nostril although it may occasionally appear at the contralateral one, suggesting that in some rabbits there is a connection between the tear ducts. The Schirmer tear test has been evaluated in rabbits. The test paper is inserted into the lower conjunctival fold in the lateral third of the eyelid and is held in place for 1 minute. The amount of wetness is measured in millimetres. Topical anaesthesia is not used. Normal values range from 0 to 11.22 mm/min, with a mean of 5.30 + 2.96 having been determined. Low values are of doubtful significance (Abrams et al., 1990), although absence of tear production can be a sign of dysautonomia. A low Schirmer tear test result indicates keratoconjunctivitis sicca in other species but this condition has not been reported to occur naturally in rabbits. Impaired tear drainage due to nasolacrimal duct disease can result in high Schirmer tear test results. Excessive tear production can also be associated with corneal irritation due to conjunctivitis, corneal abrasions, ulcerations or foreign bodies. Orbital pain may be due to uveitis, glaucoma or retrobulbar disease.",

Puberty occurs at 4\u20139 months (or when 70\u201375% of mature bodyweight is reached) with smaller breeds maturing earlier than larger breeds. Like the cat and the ferret, rabbits are induced ovulators. Although they do not show a regular oestrus cycle, they do vary in receptivity and a cyclic rhythm exists. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates ovarian follicles to develop and produce oestrogens that cause the female to be receptive. Follicular development occurs in waves with 5 to 10 follicles on each ovary being at the same stage of development at any one time. When the follicles reach maturity they produce oestrogen for about 12\u201314 days. If ovulation has not occurred during this period, the follicles degenerate with a corresponding reduction in oestrogen level and sexual receptivity. After about 4 days a new wave of follicles begins to produce oestrogen and the doe becomes receptive again. Many factors influence this cyclic rhythm including nutrition, light, temperature, sexual stimulation and individual variation. In general, the receptive period lasts 14\u201316 days with a period of non-receptivity for 1\u20132 days (Patton, 1994). This is slightly longer than the oestrogen dominant phase, and a good rule of thumb is that a doe will usually be receptive while the vulva is red and swollen. Mating stimulates ovulation approximately 10 hours post-coitus (Harkness, 1987). Ovulation can also be induced by proximity of an entire male, mechanical stimulation of the vagina or by the act of being mounted by another female. Some indiviuduals will continue to be sexually receptive throughout pregnancy, although superfoetation (maintenance of two pregnancies at different stages) does not occur.Key Points 1.18Social and reproductive behaviour\n\u2022Domestic rabbits are descended from the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, and retain many behavioural characteristics of their wild ancestors.\u2022Wild rabbits live in groups of 6\u20138 with a well-defined social hierarchy. Males fight for dominance and females aggressively defend their nesting sites.\u2022Wild rabbits seldom become tame in captivity even if they are hand-reared.\u2022Rabbits are induced ovulators without a defined oestrus cycle. Females show a cyclic rhythm of sexual receptivity.\u2022Pseudopregnancy is the result of ovulation without fertilization. Ovulation can be stimulated in the absence of mating by the close proximity of a male, mechanical stimulation or mounting by another female.\u2022Lactating does remain in the vicinity of their nest and defend it but only return once or twice daily to suckle the young.\n\n",

The breeding season usually runs from January to October and is stimulated by increasing photoperiod. Full sexual receptivity occurs every 18 days and is manifested by restlessness and increased chin rubbing. Does are fertile immediately after kindling, especially during the summer months. Breeders usually take females to the buck for mating rather than vice versa as they can be territorial and attack the buck if he is put in her hutch. Sometimes the two are introduced on neutral territory. In general, females are mated for the first time at approximately 5 months old and are not bred from over the age of 3 years (Sandford, 1996). Mating takes place within a few minutes and can be accompanied by a scream from either party, which is deemed to be normal. Mating may be repeated after a couple of hours to improve the conception rate. Artificial insemination is a recognized technique in rabbit breeding. Pregnancy can be detected by abdominal palpation. The best time for pregnancy diagnosis is 10\u201314 days after mating when the fetal units can be felt as olive-sized masses. Fetal resorption can take place up to 20 days post-coitus. Mammary development occurs in late pregnancy. Radiographically, pregnancy can be detected after the 11th day. Real-time ultrasound can be used for early pregnancy diagnosis, being reliable from day 8 onwards (Ypsilantis and Saratsis, 1999). Some does remain sexually receptive during pregnancy and will continue to be mated by a male companion; however, superfoetation does not occur. Does can be mated soon after giving birth and may be lactating and pregnant at the same time.",

In the wild, unfavourable winter conditions or lack of food suppress follicular activity. Gestation takes 31\u201332 days, with litter sizes on average being five to eight; larger breeds generally have larger litters (Sandford, 1996). It is possible for a doe to have six litters in a year and produce 40 to 50 offspring. During late pregnancy the doe may be seen carrying bedding material into her chosen nesting site. The nest is built from hay, straw or other bedding material. The quality of the nest varies between individual does and has a strong influence on the survival of the young. The doe will defend her chosen nesting site against potential intruders, especially if she is pregnant or lactating and can become aggressive towards owners, other rabbits or pets. Hair is pulled from the hip, dewlap and mammary glands to line the nest. She may consume less food at this point and should be tempted to eat, as pregnancy toxaemia is a risk during this period.

The young are altricial and born bald, blind and helpless. Most passive immunity is obtained before birth, although some antibodies are present in the colostrum (Brewer and Cruise, 1994). When the entire litter has been born, the doe pulls more fur from her body to cover the litter in its nest. Does are particularly susceptible to disturbance in the first few days after parturition and may cannibalize the young. Inexperienced does sometimes mutilate them. The legs or ears may be attacked or the skin stripped over the neck, thorax or abdomen. Cannibalization and mutilation are most likely to take place on the day of parturition and may be an extension of eating the placenta. Sometimes young rabbits are born outside the nest or the doe rejects them. These kits will die from hypothermia unless they are warmed up and returned to the nest. The doe will usually accept them and the chances of survival are far greater if the kit is reared by its natural mother rather than being hand-reared by a human. It is advisable to remove other rabbits from the hutch during late pregnancy. Female companions can cannibalize the young and entire males will mate the doe within hours of her giving birth.

It is possible for baby rabbits to survive for more than 24-h intervals between feeds, which explains why females can rear litters that exceed their number of nipples (Lang, 1981b). Suckling normally takes place in the early morning and, if the doe does return to the nest to feed the young for a second time, then it is usually in the first few days after giving birth. The baby rabbits spend most of the day buried in the warmest part of the nest, tightly grouped together conserving heat and energy. After about 22 h, the whole group becomes active and makes its way to the surface (McBride, 1988). When the mother arrives, she stands over the babies which suckle, changing nipples and position approximately every 30 seconds. After about 3 minutes, the doe leaves the nest and the babies urinate on the surface before digging themselves deep into the bedding to sleep for another 22 h. Young rabbits are totally dependent on milk until day 10. They are usually eating small amounts of solid food by day 15 (Kraus et al., 1984) and start to leave the nest and be weaned at about 25 days of age.",

Baby rabbits can be fed on powdered cat milk replacers; however, these are often less calorie dense, and much higher in carbohydrate than rabbit milk. Johnson-Delaney (1996a) advocated the addition of egg yolk to milk replacer (in this instance Esbilac) in order to increase the fat and protein levels. They will drink 2\u201330 mL of milk per feed, depending on how old they are. Baby rabbits should be fed when they are restless. Milk replacers are a nutritional compromise and do not match the composition of rabbit milk. Therefore orphan rabbits may need feeding two to three times daily, but care should be taken not to overfeed or force-feed them. Holding newborn rabbits on their backs simulates the natural nursing position. Hypothermic or moribund rabbits can be given fluids or milk replacers by stomach tube to correct hypoglycaemia. The babies should be kept warm and dry in a quiet place with suitable bedding material in which to burrow. Shredded tissue paper or kitchen roll is satisfactory for making a nest that can be put in a hay-lined cardboard box and placed in a warm environment such as an airing cupboard.",

A syringe with a teat or a small amount of tubing cut from a giving set is a satisfactory method of feeding orphans. Healthy babies suck the milk out of the syringe. Squirting milk into the mouth carries a risk of choking the rabbit. Enteritis is a potentially lethal complication of hand-rearing. Rabbits are unusual among young animals in having very few micro-organisms in the stomach and small intestine while suckling (Lang, 1981b). An antimicrobial fatty acid or \u2018milk oil\u2019 is present in the suckling rabbit. It is produced by an enzymatic reaction in the doe\u2019s milk that takes place in the suckling rabbit\u2019s stomach (Brooks, 1997). This milk oil controls the gastrointestinal microbial contents of suckling rabbits and protects them from enteric infection. Orphan rabbits that are fed on milk from other species do not develop this antimicrobial factor and are therefore more susceptible to bacterial infections introduced during feeding. It is important that boiled water and sterile syringes and feeding tubes are used to feed orphans and that each feed is made up just prior to being given. Overfeeding can cause digestive upsets. In general, it is preferable to underfeed than overfeed. Small babies can soon make up their weight once they are weaned and able to digest solid food.",

Egg yolk can be added to increase the amount of fat and protein given.\u2022Kits should be fed several times a day, in response to increase in activity. A tiny teat or a measure of soft drip tubing attached to a syringe can be used. Kits should be regularly weighed to assess weight gains/losses.\u2022The stomach of baby rabbits is very susceptible to infection when being hand-reared. The addition of probiotics to the rearing milk should be considered.\u2022Baby rabbits should be offered access to hay and small pellets from day 10 onwards.\u2022Caecotrophs from a healthy adult rabbit can be used to colonize the gut with suitable bacteria at the time of weaning.\n\n",

It is beneficial for rabbits to be neutered for similar reasons to the dog or cat. Neutering prevents unwanted pregnancies and pseudopregnancies and permits both sexes to be housed together. Male aggression is reduced or abolished, so fight and bite wounds are minimized. Neutering also modifies scent marking by spraying urine or depositing faeces. Female reproductive disorders such as uterine or mammary neoplasia and endometritis occur frequently in the middle-aged doe. Spaying is indicated to prevent these diseases.

Those rabbits that are kept in gardens visited by wild rabbits are most at risk. Myxomatosis is a member of the poxvirus family and is almost universally fatal in unvaccinated rabbits. Outbreaks of myxomatosis occur seasonally, reaching their peak in the late summer. Historically in the UK a live vaccine (Nobivac Myxo) prepared from attenuated Shope fibroma virus grown on cell line culture has been used. Shope fibroma virus naturally affects the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus floridanus that is native to North America. It is antigenically related to myxoma virus and cross-immunity occurs. Shope fibroma virus is transmissible to the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus in which it produces localized benign fibromas. The disadvantage of this vaccine is that it is less immunogenic than attenuated myxoma virus vaccines, and the duration of immunity is short. With the introduction of a novel combined myxomatosis/viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) vaccine, this stand-alone myxomatosis vaccine is likely to be withdrawn from sale. In other parts of Europe modified live myxoma virus vaccines have been used; however, these are known to cause immunosuppresion, which can cause significant disease problems in large rabbitries.",

This is important because travel to and handling/manipulation whilst at the veterinary surgery is intrinsically stressful to most rabbits and can result in the measurable physiological changes detailed below.Box 1.10Stress in rabbitsCauses of stress of rabbits\n\u2022Pain and disease\u2022Unfamiliar surroundings\u2022Transport\u2022Rough handling\u2022Proximity of potential predators: dogs, cats, ferrets, birds of prey and, for wild rabbits, humans\u2022A dominant companion and no means of escape\u2022Inability to exhibit natural behaviour patterns, e.g., to forage, make a nest or interact socially\u2022Poor husbandry: insufficient food, water and indigestible fibre, excessively high or low environmental temperature (see Section 1.2.1 in this chapter regarding \u2018Five Freedoms\u2019 of animal welfare).\nEffects of stress in rabbitsMany of the effects of stress are linked to the release of catecholamines or corticosteroids and can be life-threatening:\u2022Catecholamine release can cause heart failure and death. Stress due to overcrowding has been used to induce cardiomyopathy in laboratory rabbits.\u2022Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system inhibits activity of the gastrointestinal tract. Gut motility is reduced, which can have a knock-on effect. Gut stasis, trichobezoar formation (hairballs), enterotoxaemia and mucoid enteropathy can all be linked with stress.\u2022Stress in rabbits causes a marked decrease in urine flow, renal plasma flow and filtration rate. Oliguria can last from 30 to 120 minutes.\u2022Stress can increase gastric acidity and cause gastric ulceration in rabbits.\u2022Stress is immunosuppressive. Rabbits suffering from dental disease have lymphocyte counts significantly lower than those of healthy rabbits.\u2022Stress affects carbohydrate metabolism. Handling alone can cause an increase in blood glucose to the order of 8.5 mmol/L. Blood glucose levels can be very high (20\u201325 mmol/L) in association with intestinal obstruction and other stressful diseases.\u2022Stress causes anorexia that, in combination with disruption to normal carbohydrate metabolism, can lead to hepatic lipidosis, liver failure and death.\nWays to minimize stress in rabbits undergoing veterinary treatment\n\u2022Use analgesics in any situation where the rabbit may be experiencing pain.\u2022Use quiet, gentle handling and sedate or anaesthetize rabbits for painful or uncomfortable procedures.\u2022Wrap rabbits in a towel for examination or procedures such as blood sampling.\u2022Keep rabbits away from the sight, sound and smell of predators, e.g., barking dogs, ferrets.\u2022Provide hay as bedding material for rabbits awaiting or recovering from surgery. Hay smells familiar and provides security for timid animals. It is also a source of indigestible fibre and foraging material.\u2022Consider hospitalizing a bonded companion with a sick rabbit.\u2022Minimize stressful procedures or devices, e.g., Elizabethan collars or nasogastric tubes.\n",

Administration of exogenous adrenaline to rabbits results in redistribution of lymphocytes from spleen and bone marrow to peripheral blood, lungs and liver (Toft et al., 1992a).

These can include causing gut stasis, oliguria, flare-ups of subclinical infection and in extreme cases death.\u2022It is desirable to ensure that any interaction with a rabbit is as stress-free as possible.\u2022Potential stressors include:1.\nThe journey to the vets. Owners should try and minimize travel time, make certain that the rabbit does not become too hot or cold, provide suitable food for the rabbit, consider bringing the bonded companion and cover the rabbit\u2019s cage whilst in transit to reduce visual stimuli.2.\nThe waiting room. Veterinary staff should try to avoid having rabbits exposed to potential predators for long periods; an alternative waiting area is preferable. In cases where the proximity of dogs and cats is unavoidable, waiting times should be kept to the minimum and the rabbit perhaps kept under supervision outside in the car, or taken into a preparation room or quiet ward until the consultation.3.\nThe consultation. Rabbits that are handled calmly and gently are much less reactive. Pain relief should be given promptly for any condition that is potentially painful, and examination under sedation considered. Some rabbits will need to be restrained using a towel; however, many respond to just a gentle covering of the eyes and stay still.4.\nHospitalization. Ideally rabbits should be housed separately from cats, dogs and ferrets. Finding a quiet place in the clinic is beneficial; however, staff must be able to perform adequate observations. Rabbits should be provided with familiar food, litter and bedding materials. Any medical treatments should be carried out in the least stressful manner possible. Use of sedatives such as midazolam at very low doses can be considered when an animal appears very distressed in hospital.\n\nin the waiting room.

Conditions such as digestive or respiratory tract disorders require more intensive nursing than many owners are willing or able to provide at home. As rabbits are good at hiding, illness and significant alterations in condition may pass unnoticed without regular knowledgeable observation. Medication in the form of intravenous fluids, daily injections or nebulization may be necessary. Regular syringe feeding, clipping and bathing may be required. Observation of behaviour, appetite, faecal and urine output is easier if the rabbit is kept on its own under the careful eye of competent nursing staff. A stress-free environment is required. Accommodation needs to be away from barking dogs and the sight and smell of predators. Ideally rabbits would be housed in a separate quiet room, where the nursing staff are able to spend time observing their patients as well as performing tasks such as assist feeding and medicating. Hospitalized rabbits should be provided with a bed of good- quality hay to nibble and lie on. The familiar smell of hay gives them security. All rabbits should be provided with some kind of hide, such as a cardboard box or short length of plastic drainpipe. House rabbits can be very particular in their choice of litter material and may be reluctant to use a tray that does not contain the correct type of litter. Most owners are willing to bring in the correct type of material for their rabbit\u2019s litter tray. Fresh water needs to be provided in a drinking container that the rabbit is familiar with. Some rabbits will not use a sipper bottle. It is worth considering hospitalizing a bonded companion of a sick rabbit as rabbits can become stressed if they are separated.

The application of a transdermal local anaesthetic cream (EMLA) may be sufficient to allow intravenous injection in very sick animals. Sedation prior to intravenous barbiturate injection is preferable if the owner wishes to be present. The owner may wait with their rabbit until the sedative has taken effect. A combination of acepromazine and butorphanol (0.5 mg/kg acepromazine plus 0.1 mg/kg butorphanol) can be given by subcutaneous injection and has the advantage of vasodilation that facilitates venepuncture. Alternatively, fentanyl/fluanisone (0.3\u20130.5 mL/kg) (Hypnorm, Janssen) can be used but it is given by intramuscular injection, which is more distressing to patient and owner than a subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous (50 mg/kg) ketamine with or without other agents can be used. Medetomidine is an effective sedative but causes peripheral vasoconstriction, which can make the lethal intravenous barbiturate injection difficult. Medetomidine in combination with buprenorphine results in rapid loss of consciousness with little peripheral vasoconstriction. This combination needs to be given intramuscularly.",

It may be difficult to visualize the vessels in obese animals. The rabbit should be wrapped in a towel and held securely by an assistant. The head is extended backwards and the hair over the throat clipped off. The jugular vein can usually be visualized in the jugular furrow and is raised by occluding the vessel by a finger at the thoracic inlet. Up to 10 mL of blood can be safely collected from any sized rabbit from this site. Difficulties can arise with short-nosed breeds such as the Netherland dwarf or animals with upper respiratory tract problems that can become distressed or even cyanosed when the head is extended backwards. Alternative sites such as the cephalic or lateral saphenous veins can be used instead. The lateral saphenous vein is more easily accessible and is often a larger size than the cephalic vein. The vessel is very superficial and collapses easily if too much negative pressure is applied. Large haematomas can occur if adequate pressure is not applied after the blood sample has been taken. It is a good idea to make a blood film in addition to placing the blood in sample tubes. The film can be quickly stained and examined for a differential white cell count, which, in addition to a PCV, will give an immediate assessment of the rabbit\u2019s health status in the absence of sophisticated laboratory equipment.

Intravenous catheters can be held in place with adhesive tape or a few drops of skin glue (Vetbond) or superglue. A simple method is to cut one wing off a 21-gauge or 23-gauge butterfly set before placing it in the marginal ear vein. The remaining wing can be superglued to the fur on the pinna to keep the needle in place. No bandaging is required to keep the needle in place in sedated or moribund patients, although a piece of bandage tied around the rabbit\u2019s neck can be used to hold the giving set out of the way. Most rabbits tolerate the procedure well. Superglue is not as satisfactory for keeping intravenous catheters in place because they have a smaller wing that does not provide a large surface area for the bonding agent.

            "text": "This route introduces fluids and drugs into the medullary cavity of long bones so they are absorbed into the venous circulation. Anything that can be administered intravenously can be given intraosseously. There are several advantages to this technique, which avoids the necessity of cannulating a small collapsed vein in moribund patients. The intraosseous route is often used for small exotic animal patients such as birds, reptiles, guinea pigs and pot-bellied pigs where it is difficult to find a peripheral vein. Most rabbits are large enough and have sufficient accessible veins to use the intravenous route but there are occasions when intraosseous administration of drugs and especially fluids can be life-saving. Some practitioners prefer this method of fluid administration and use it routinely. Disadvantages include the risk of introducing infection and causing osteomyelitis. The rate of administration can be slow. These problems can be overcome by using careful aseptic techniques and multiple sites. Immature bones with active growth plates and diseased or fractured bones are not suitable. A needle is used to bore a hole through a bony prominence into the marrow cavity. Direct penetration of the marrow cavity is easier in the tibia or humerus of the rabbit than the femur. The anatomy of the head of the femur requires penetration of the trochanteric fossa so the cortical bone is penetrated three times instead of once (see Figure 1.19). The humerus is the preferred site. In conscious animals, local anaesthetic is infiltrated around the injection site, which is clipped and aseptically prepared prior to the introduction of the needle. A 20- to 22-gauge needle that is about half the length of the bone is required, i.e., 4\u20136 cm (1.5\u20132.5 in.). Spinal needles with a stylet that prevents a plug of bone clogging up the bore are most suitable but ordinary hypodermic needles can be used with a smaller gauge needle, catheter stylet or a length of wire acting as the stylet. The bone is penetrated by using the needle as a drill. The needle should be kept straight when boring the hole in the bone; this is easier to achieve if the needle is attached to a syringe that is then used as a handle. Moving the needle from side to side results in a larger hole than is required and leakage of fluid around the injection site. Penetration of the cortex can be felt as a sudden lack of resistance. The needle may need to be redirected slightly to push it down the medullary cavity. It is important to be certain that the tip of the needle is in the medullary cavity and not pushed against or penetrating the cortex. At this point the stylet is removed and a syringe attached to the needle to aspirate bone marrow which confirms correct placement of the needle. If there is any doubt, radiography is indicated. If the needle is not placed correctly, it should be withdrawn and a different bone selected to attempt the procedure again. Once the needle is placed it can be glued or sutured in place. Dressings and antiseptics can be used for protection and to reduce the likelihood of infection. Heparin should be introduced into the catheter every 4\u20136 h. The needle should not be left in place for longer than 72 h. When it is removed a light dressing and some antiseptic can be applied to the site (Anderson, 1995).",

A technique for placing a pharyngotomy tube has been described for laboratory rabbits (Rogers et al., 1988). Under general anaesthesia a 1-cm incision is made 5 mm from the midline just anterior to the larynx on the left-hand side. A tube is passed through the oral cavity into the oesophagus and down to the stomach. The tube is grasped with artery forceps through the mouth and pushed against the wall of the pharynx to cause a bulge under-the-skin incision. The muscle overlying the bulge is carefully incised using the hard tip of the artery forceps in the pharynx as a guide. The pharyngeal wall is incised and the oral end of the stomach tube exteriorized through the incision. The tube is then anchored at the pharyngeal incision before being run through the subcutaneous tissues to emerge at the base of the ear where it is anchored with skin sutures. Pharyngotomy tubes placed in this manner have been left in laboratory rabbits for 6\u201312 months to ensure accurate doses of the drugs that were being tested. The catheters were well tolerated and the rabbits continued to eat and drink without losing weight. This technique could be applied to pet rabbits.

The collars are stressful and are most likely to be fitted at a time when it is important to minimize stress levels such as after surgery or during periods of anorexia. Significant elevations in plasma glucose levels have been found in rabbits fitted with collars (Knudtzon, 1988). Elizabethan collars also prevent a rabbit from consuming caecotrophs. Caecotrophs are rich in amino acids and vitamins and necessary for optimum nutrition and wound healing. Collar edges also damage the external pinnae of all but the shortest-eared rabbits, and this can contribute to discomfort. Good surgical technique, buried subcuticular sutures and the correct choice of suture material reduces the need for Elizabethan collars postoperatively. If collars are deemed necessary, then padding the edges to avoid ear damage, having supervised periods without the collar to allow caecotrophy and considering the use of clear collars to maintain field of vision can be helpful.

It is important to use isotonic saline as the vehicle. Experimental nebulization of rabbits with hypertonic saline (3.6%) caused extravasation of water into the sub-epithelial tissue of the airway wall. The formation of oedema was associated with a decrease in compliance and gas exchange (Hogman et al., 1997).Key Points 1.24Fluid therapy and nutritional support\n\u2022Subcutaneous injections are well tolerated by rabbits, and in rabbits that are not massively dehydrated large volumes of fluids can be given subcutaneously.

A butterfly cannula can be superglued to the pinna for easy administration; intravenous catheters can also be secured and are well tolerated.

Anything that can be administered into a vein can be administered intraosseously. Rabbits may show signs of pain on intraosseous injection.\u2022Nutritional support is life-saving in rabbits and is preferably given by syringe feeding.\u2022Formulations for nutritional support should include carbohydrate as a source of glucose that can be absorbed from the small intestine to prevent hypoglycaemia and mobilization of free fatty acids.\u2022Powdered formulations given through a syringe cannot provide indigestible fibre to stimulate gastrointestinal motility. It is long particles of indigestible fibre, not small particles of fermentable fibre, that stimulate gut motility. Prokinetic drugs may be necessary until the rabbit starts feeding voluntarily.\u2022Powdered formulations can be a source of fermentable (digestible) fibre as a substrate for caecal microflora.\u2022A tempting palatable source of indigestible fibre should be available for all sick rabbits.

            "text": "Figure 1.3: Schematic diagram of the anatomy of the alimentary tract of the rabbit. (A) The alimentary tract of the rabbit is adapted for the digestion of large quantities of fibrous food. The teeth continually grow and wear against each other to maintain their shape. The incisors are worn to a fine cutting edge that can be used to slice through vegetation or gnaw hard substances such as bark or wood. The occlusal surfaces of the cheek teeth are worn to an effective grinding surface that is used to reduce food particles to a small enough size to be swallowed. There are a number of well-developed salivary glands. The cardia and pyloric sphincter are muscular and well-developed. The relatively voluminous stomach is simple in type and always contains food. The stomach contents comprise approximately 15% of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract. (B) The duodenum forms a loop with descending, transverse and ascending parts. It has an extensive mesentery. The duodenum begins with a slight enlargement approximately 1 cm from the pylorus that receives the bile duct. The right lobe of the pancreas is widely dispersed in the mesoduodenum as many isolated lobules. The main body and left lobe of the pancreas run in the mesentery that attaches the transverse colon to the stomach and spleen (see Figure 8.2). A single accessory pancreatic duct opens into the junction between the descending and transverse duodenum. (C) The jejunum is long, convoluted and relatively free of attachments. It occupies the dorsal half of the left flank and the caudal half of the abdomen (see Figure 1.13, Figure 1.14, Figure 1.15). The ileum is closely associated with the mesentery that connects part of the ascending colon to the caecum to form the ileocaecocolic complex (see E). The end of the ileum is expanded into a thick-walled sacculus rotundus. (D) The caecum and appendix are shown as a straight tube, but are in fact a coiled spiral (see E). The thin-walled caecum is a large organ that ends in an appendix that is heavily endowed with lymphoid tissue. The ascending colon of the rabbit can be divided into four sections. The first section is approximately 10 cm long and has three longitudinal flat bands of muscular tissue or taeniae that separate rows of haustra or sacculations. Small protrusions, \u2018warzen\u2019 (warts), approximately 0.5 mm in diameter, can be seen on the mucosa in this section of colon. The second section of ascending colon is approximately 20 cm in length and has a single taenia and fewer, smaller haustra. The third portion of the ascending colon is termed the fusus coli and is a muscular area about 4 cm long. The fusus coli opens into the fourth section of ascending colon that is histologically indistinguishable from the transverse and descending colon. Because the fusus coli forms such a natural division between two morphologically and functionally distinct sections of the rabbit colon, the terms \u2018proximal\u2019 and \u2018distal\u2019 colon are sometimes used instead of ascending, transverse and descending colon (Snipes et al., 1982). The proximal colon includes the three taeniae section, the single taenia section and the fusus coli. The distal colon is 80\u2013100 cm long and runs from the fusus coli to the rectum. (E) A ventral view of the ileocaecocolic complex, which occupies more than half of abdomen, mainly on the right side (see Figure 1.13, Figure 1.14, Figure 1.15). The complex has been slightly unrolled in order to illustrate its component parts. There are mesenteric attachments between the caecum, appendix, proximal colon, ileum, distal colon and descending duodenum. These organs form a complex three-dimensional structure in rabbits. The term \u2018ileocaecocolic complex\u2019 is used to describe the structure in this text. The body of the caecum has a spiral form consisting of one and a half turns, ending in an appendix that extends to the right flank. The axis of the spiral is the base of the caecum that receives the end of the ileum in the form of the sacculus rotundus. The ileum lies between the concavity of the body of the caecum and the convexity of the upper ascending colon and is attached to these two structures by peritoneal folds. Because of their peritoneal attachments to the spiral caecum, the ileum and upper ascending colon are also arranged in a spiral, and are integral components of the ileocaecocolic complex. The upper ascending colon begins as a smooth oval dilation, the ampulla coli, that forms the junction with the sacculus rotundus and the caecum. Parts of the descending colon and descending duodenum are attached to the distal end of the caecum by peritoneal folds. The left lobe of the pancreas lies in the peritoneal fold between the descending duodenum and descending colon.",

            "text": "Figure 1.4: The activity of the digestive system during excretion of hard and soft faeces. (A) The motility and function of the hindgut can change depending on the type of faeces formed within the colon. The formation of hard faeces is known as the hard faeces phase and the expulsion of caecotrophs is known as the soft faeces phase. The phases of excretion follow a marked circadian rhythm. The hard faeces phase is shown in black. The soft faeces phase is shown in green. Exchange of water, electrolytes and nutrients across the intestinal epithelium alter with the phase of faeces excretion. The direction of water and electrolyte exchange is indicated by arrows. The proximal part of the ascending colon is able to separate digesta into two fractions that are simultaneously sent in opposite directions. During the hard faeces phase, water is secreted into the proximal colon and the intestinal contents are thoroughly mixed by contractions of the caecum and colon. Large indigestible particles (> 0.5 mm) tend to accumulate in the lumen of the proximal part of the ascending colon and are moved distally, whereas smaller particles accumulate at the circumference in the sac-like haustra. Haustrum is the Latin term for a pump. Haustral activity sends the small particles and fluid proximally into the caecum where bacterial fermentation takes place. The indigestible fraction, composed of large particles, is moved rapidly through the proximal colon to the fusus coli and distal colon where it is formed into hard, round, dry pellets that are excreted from the anus. Rhythmic caecal contractility is greatest during the hard faeces phase. (B) Periodically, the motility of the caecum and proximal colon alters completely. Haustral activity ceases and the caecum contracts, sending caecal material swiftly along the large intestine. In the fusus coli the material is formed into soft pellets that become encapsulated in mucus (see Figure 1.5). This is the soft faeces phase of excretion when caecotrophs pass through the colon to be expelled from the anus. Expulsion of caecotrophs coincides with a decrease in rhythmic motility of the caecum and proximal colon, and increase in motility of the distal colon. Soft faeces or caecotrophs are expelled once or twice daily, at least 4 h after feeding, usually during periods of rest. The transit time for soft faeces through the colon is 1.5\u20132.5 times faster than that for hard faeces. Motility in the upper gastrointestinal tract remains the same during the hard and soft faeces phases. The differences in colonic motility during the hard and soft faeces phase of excretion are most pronounced in the second section of proximal colon that has a single row of haustra. The fusus coli is a specially adapted area of the colon that acts as a differential pacemaker for the initiation of peristaltic waves in the proximal and distal colon that alter with the phase of faeces excretion. The fusus coli is highly innervated and is influenced by hormones such as aldosterone and prostaglandins. During the hard faeces phase, the intestinal contents lose considerable quantities of water, potassium and sodium during their passage through the fusus coli. Water is mechanically squeezed out of the fibrous material before it passes to the distal colon where absorption of water, volatile fatty acids and electrolytes continues, leaving the residue of dry, indigestible matter that is expelled as hard faecal pellets.",

During the spring, blood samples were taken from seven rabbits that lived in hutches and four rabbits that had been kept under free-range conditions with unlimited access to natural daylight through the winter months. The samples were spun and the plasma frozen immediately before shipping in a frozen state to a laboratory for 1,25-(OH)2D3 assay. Four rabbits, one from the free-range group and three from the hutch group, had undetectable plasma 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentrations (< 2.5 pmol/L), indicating that vitamin D deficiency can be present in pet rabbits, especially after the winter. The rabbits were kept in North Yorkshire where winter sunshine is minimal. In laboratory rabbits kept without exposure to ultraviolet light and fed on a vitamin D-deficient diet, it takes approximately 5 months for serum concentrations of 25-OH-D and 1,25-(OH)2D3 to become undetectable.",

Ninety rabbit owners completed a questionnaire about the feeding habits of their pet. All the rabbits were fed on mixed rations purchased as \u2018rabbit food\u2019. Hay was offered to all the rabbits in the survey although they did not always eat it. Some rabbits were given additional vegetables or allowed to graze in a run periodically through the summer months. In nearly every case, a bowl of \u2018rabbit food\u2019 was left with the rabbit permanently. Discarded food was thrown away and the bowl topped once or twice daily. This feeding practice allowed rabbits to select their favourite food items and eat nothing else. Some rabbits existed on one or two ingredients. The low calcium cereals and peas were the rabbits\u2019 favourite part of the ration. The pellets that contain a vitamin and mineral supplement were the least palatable part of the mixture.

The jugular, cephalic and saphenous veins are in similar positions to those of other domestic animals such as dogs and cats. All these sites can be used for blood sampling and intravenous injections in rabbits. The jugular vein is the greatest in diameter and is the best site for taking blood samples. The ear vein is also satisfactory in large breeds or for collecting small volumes. The needle and syringe may need to be heparinized as rabbit blood clots very quickly. Suggested techniques (Further information is given in Section 1.10.3). Jugular blood sampling: good restraint is required for taking blood from the jugular vein. The rabbit should be wrapped in a towel, placed on the edge of a table and held by an assistant. The head is raised and held back, either by the assistant or by the person collecting the blood. It is important to ensure that the head is held straight. The fur over the jugular furrow is clipped off. Usually, the vein is easily visualized and can be raised by placing a finger at the thoracic inlet. A good-quality sample of 5\u201310 mL of blood can be collected quickly from this site without either haemolysis or clotting. Intravenous fluid therapy. A simple method of venepuncture for intravenous fluid therapy is to use a 21- or 23-gauge butterfly catheter (see Section 1.10.4.2). One wing is removed before inserting the needle, bevel up, into the marginal ear vein (caudal auricular vein). The remaining wing is \u2018superglued\u2019 to the fur on the ear after the needle has been inserted into the vein. The wing provides a large surface area of contact with the ear. In sedated or moribund rabbits, no bandaging is necessary to keep the needle in place, although a piece of bandage tied around the rabbit\u2019s neck can be used to hold the giving set out of the way. An intravenous catheter may be used instead of the butterfly set, but is not as satisfactory because the wing does not have as large a surface area for the bonding agent. Alternative sites for intravenous fluid therapy are the cephalic and saphenous veins. Intraosseous fluid therapy. In all intraosseous sites, a spinal needle is preferable because the stylet prevents bone clogging the needle. A spinal needle is stronger and more able to penetrate the bone. Possible sites for intraosseous administration: 1. Proximal humerus: this is the easiest site for access to a medullary cavity. An imaginary straight line is made using the greater trochanter of the humerus and the elbow joint as landmarks. The needle is inserted through the greater trochanter and directed along the imaginary line to penetrate into the medullary cavity. 2. Tibial crest: an intraosseous catheter can be inserted just caudoproximal to the tibial crest. However, the lateral wall of the tibial cortex curves medially and the needle must be directed towards the medial aspect of the tibia in order to penetrate the medullary cavity. If the needle is mistakenly inserted along an imaginary straight line towards the hock joint, it will go into the cortex of the tibia and miss the medullary cavity. 3. Proximal femur: this is the least satisfactory site for intraosseous fluid therapy because of the well-developed trochanteric fossa. This can be seen on the caudal view of the femur. The path of an intraosseous catheter must pass through this fossa to gain access to the medullary cavity. Therefore, to gain access to the medullary cavity three layers of cortical bone must be penetrated. 4. Difficult-to-groom areas. The areas of skin that are difficult for a rabbit to reach and groom are shown as green shading. Obesity or other flexibility problems hinder grooming in these areas and allow dead hair, skin debris and parasites to accumulate. Signs of skin disease often begin at these sites. The area between the tail and the dorsum can become contaminated by urine, faeces and is often the site that flies choose to lay their eggs. These are the areas that owners should pay particular attention to when grooming their pet.",
