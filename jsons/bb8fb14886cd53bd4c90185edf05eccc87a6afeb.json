To aid clinicians in consistently selecting lung-and diaphragm-protective ventilation settings, a physiology-based decision support system is needed. To form the foundation of such a system, a comprehensive physiological model which captures the dynamics of ventilation has been developed. The Lung and Diaphragm Protective Ventilation (LDPV) model centers around respiratory drive and incorporates respiratory system mechanics, ventilator mechanics, and blood acid-base balance. The model uses patient-specific parameters as inputs and outputs predictions of a patient's transpulmonary and esophageal driving pressures (outputs most clinically relevant to lung and diaphragm safety), as well as their blood pH, under various ventilator and sedation conditions. Model simulations and global optimization techniques were used to evaluate and characterize the model. The LDPV model is demonstrated to describe a CO 2 respiratory response that is comparable to what is found in literature. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicate that the ventilator and sedation settings incorporated in the model have a significant impact on the target output parameters. Finally, the model is seen to be able to provide robust predictions of esophageal pressure, transpulmonary pressure and blood pH for patient parameters with realistic variability. The LDPV model is a robust physiological model which produces outputs which directly target and reflect the risk of ventilator-induced lung and diaphragm injury. Ventilation and sedation parameters are seen to modulate the model outputs in accordance with what is currently known in literature.",

The goals of mechanical ventilation are to ensure adequate oxygenation, carbon dioxide elimination and respiratory muscle unloading, and to decrease the oxygen cost of breathing. While mechanical ventilation has been proven to be extremely effective for managing a variety of patients [1, 2] , it is associated with a risk of ventilator-induced lung and diaphragm injury [2, 3] , especially if ventilator settings are not optimized. For instance, permitting higher plateau pressures (pressure at end-inspiration when there is no flow) or higher tidal volumes can result in dangerously high levels of lung stress and strain [4] , which may lead to the development of acute lung injury [5] .",

Earlier CDSSs were mostly rule-based systems that used clinical heuristics-simplified decisionmaking strategies that use only a few available parametersto select ventilator settings [6] . Rule-based systems attempt to achieve specified ventilation targets [7, 8] or maintain a patient's ventilatory parameters within a predetermined comfort range [9] . They are designed to help clinicians by providing them with suggestions on what actions to take when the conditions for the actions are met. However, these systems do not consider the physiological differences between patients, or even the same patient at different times in the disease process, and thus do not ensure that the suggested actions are optimal for each individual patient at any point in time. In addition, rule-based systems do not provide clinicians with insight into a patient's physiological state. In contrast to rule-based CDSSs, physiologically based CDSSs are useful for optimizing ventilator settings for individualized patient safety, predicting the effects of various ventilation strategies, and monitoring a patient's overall physiological status [10] .",

Some physiologically-based CDSSs focus primarily on modeling pulmonary gas exchange and ensuring safe and adequate oxygenation and CO 2 elimination [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Others integrate lung protection as a ventilation target but rely on indirect parameters of lung stress (tidal volume) and patient effort (respiratory rate, oxygen consumption) [16] . Preliminary data suggest that a CDSS designed in this way achieves safe ventilatory conditions in patients who are weaning from mechanical ventilation [17] . It is uncertain whether this approach would effectively avoid both overassistance and under-assistance diaphragm myotrauma- [3, 18] . Moreover, existing systems do not account for the effects of sedation on respiratory drive and inspiratory effort [19] [20] [21] . Finally, existing CDSSs operating under pressure support ventilation, a common mode of assisted ventilation, do not incorporate the expiratory cycling threshold; this important setting determines patient-ventilator synchrony and can substantially modify the volume delivered by the ventilator. Incorporating this setting into the CDSS might significantly enhance the effectiveness and tolerability of ventilation.",

The latter was included as a prototypical mode where ventilator support is proportional to patient effort. Compared to existing models, our model is the first to (1) focus on the effects of respiratory effort on lung as well as diaphragm injury; (2) output target indicators theorized to directly reflect the risk of lung and diaphragm injury [18, [22] [23] [24] ; (3) consider the impact of propofol, a common drug used to sedate patients under ventilatory care; (4) incorporate an expiratory cycling threshold under pressure support mode. While mathematical equations describing the dynamics of these four factors exist in the literature, to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to integrate them together into a single cohesive mathematical model. Section 2 describes the individual systems incorporated into the model, how they are integrated, and how outputs are generated. Section 3 demonstrates the validity and robustness of the model through a simulation study. Section 4 offers a discussion of the rationale for the model, how it compares to existing models, the results of the simulation study, and the model's limitations.",

Lung and respiratory muscle mechanics Figure 1 illustrates how each component interacts with the rest of the model. Individual components require either patient-specific parameters, control parameters or calculated parameters as inputs. Patient-specific input parameters are values that vary from patient to patient. These parameters can either be relatively stable within patients over brief periods (such as lung elastance and central chemoreceptor sensitivity) or change throughout the duration of the intervention (such as respiratory frequency). Control parameters are values that clinicians can directly modify. In the LDPV model, the control parameters are: ventilator mode, inspiratory support level, flow-cycle threshold, propofol infusion rate and propofol infusion duration. Calculated parameters, such as CO 2 partial pressure, are intermediate parameter values determined by system components using patient and control parameters. Each component produces either calculated parameters or the final model outputs indicators. The system has three output indicators: transpulmonary driving pressure (the swing in transpulmonary pressure between end-inhalation and end-expiration, \u2206P L ), esophageal driving pressure (the swing in esophageal pressure between endinhalation and end-expiration, \u2206P ES ) and pH. Section 2.1-2.5 provide mathematical descriptions of each system component. The patient parameters necessary for each component are given in Table 1 . All relevant mathematical symbols are defined in Online Resource 1. The full solution process is detailed in Online Resource 2.4.",

The level of sedation patients receive can thus have a significant effect on their ventilatory response and their respiratory effort level [20, 21] .

Although the model is evaluated under steady-state conditions, determining both the central and peripheral chemoreflex drives is necessary as propofol, one of the chosen control parameters, only affects central chemoreflex receptors. Thus, the included respiratory control model was selected as it separates the impact of the central and peripheral chemoreflex drives on respiration, allowing the model to be more easily modified to include propofol.

The output indicators for lung and diaphragm protective ventilation (\u2206P L , \u2206P ES ) can then be easily determined.",

In addition, the model does not allow for the modification of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP). While modifying PEEP can influence respiratory effort, mechanics and gas exchange, it is highly unpredictable and to our knowledge, there is no existing mathematical model of the relationship between PEEP and respiratory drive.

The INVENT system [12] adapts the same respiratory control model but determines the hydrogen ion concentrations affecting each chemoreceptor. In the INVENT system, central chemoreceptor drive is dependent on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrogen ion concentrations while peripheral chemoreceptor drive is dependent on arterial hydrogen ion concentration. This increases the complexity of the system as a CSF acid-base model is necessary, in addition to the model for blood acid-base. Furthermore, while the increased specificity may improve system accuracy, it also introduces additional assumptions and limitations. In INVENT, the CSF strong ion difference is assumed to be a constant value estimated from venous blood bicarbonate. In addition, CSF hydrogen ion concentration is dependent on cerebral blood flow, which can change in response to changes in the bicarbonate concentration or arterial CO 2 pressure and this variation is not accounted for by the CSF acid-base model [43] . In contrast, the respiratory control model presented here is adapted directly [25] and accounts for the difference between the central and peripheral chemoreceptors only using the receptor thresholds. This greatly simplifies the overall model and does not introduce any additional assumptions or limitations, but likely increases simulation error (though the significance of such error is likely to be low as the model outputs are seen to be relatively insensitive to receptor thresholds).",

Such a threshold ensures that any changes in patient effort levels lead to an appropriate response from the ventilator.

Figure 9c , d and Table 5 indicate that the target outputs from the pressure support simulations almost always lie within the defined physiologically plausible ranges. Overall, the simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the LDPV model. The results show that, for any set of clinically relevant inputs, the LDPV model will produce a set of outputs that are (at the very least) physiologically plausible. The results of the simulation also illustrate the range of possible outputs of the model; all model outputs are predicted to lie between the maximum and minimum Pareto fronts depicted. Although only 100 iterations were performed for each objective, the outputs of the simulation covered a wide range of values. Furthermore, the simulation considered all possible combinations of inputs, including combinations that may not even be physiologically plausible. While several parameters used static nominal values to reduce computational complexity, the model outputs can be seen to have low sensitivity to these parameters. Hence, using static values for these parameters should a low impact on the maximum and minimum Pareto fronts.",

Separate acid-base models would be required to properly determine the hydrogen ion concentrations affecting each chemoreceptor. However, to simplify the LDPV model, these concentrations are assumed to be the same and any difference would be accounted for by the different receptor thresholds. If the thresholds are not selected properly, this assumption can result in estimation error. However, the significance of this error is likely to be low as the model outputs can be seen to be relatively insensitive to the threshold values (see Online Resource 4.2).",

While many of these parameters (age, height, respiratory frequency, etc.) are captured via normal clinical assessment and do not require any invasive measurements, some parameters, such as propofol concentration or chest wall mechanics, are not typically or easily assessed. By requiring too many input parameters, the LDPV model and its associated CDSS might prove difficult to implement in the clinical setting. However, as shown in Online Resource 4.2, the output indicators are insensitive to many patient-specific parameters. Several possible approaches can be taken to address this limitation. One possible approach is to use the LDPV to simulate outputs from a selected number of the more difficult to measure inputs and then use these input-output pairs in a supervised machine learning model that predicts these inputs from the clinical outputs. A welltrained machine learning model should be able to predict reasonable values for these inputs given measurements of a patient's P L, P ES and pH. These inputs can then be used in the LDPV model to help guide subsequent decisions. An alternative approach is to use the LDPV model to explore in greater detail the sensitivity of the clinical outputs on the difficult to measure inputs. If certain inputs do not significantly impact the model outputs, it might also be possible to use nominal values for these inputs for subsequent modelling and decision support.",

Initial simulations produced results which demonstrate that outputs physiological responses consistent with what is expected.
