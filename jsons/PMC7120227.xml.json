DNA replication is at the heart of cell division. In each cell, this process starts from specific sites along the genome called DNA replication origins. According to the replicon model (Jacob et al. 1963), a DNA replication origin is a genetically defined sequence with which specific proteins interact. A single origin, with a specific sequence, is sufficient to replicate the small bacterial genome. This model has been fully validated in prokaryotes as well as bacteriophages and plasmids. It has been extended to eukaryotic DNA viruses and also Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where a 12\u201317 bp-specific consensus sequence is common to replication origins. In metazoans, 30,000 to 50,000 origins are used during each cell cycle in order to replicate all the chromosomes before mitosis. However, the nature of these DNA replication origins remains poorly defined. Despite recent important progress in this field of research, what determines a metazoan DNA replication origin and how they are assembled on chromatin remain obscure in multicellular eukaryotes.",

            "text": "The concept of a replication origin as a genetically distinct sequence with which specific proteins interact was first proposed for bacteria (Jacob et al. 1963) and was fully validated in prokaryotes, bacteriophages, plasmids, and, later on, also in eukaryotic DNA viruses and S. cerevisiae, where DNA replication origins share a 12\u201317 bp AT-rich specific consensus sequence (see M\u00e9chali 2010 for a review). In multicellular eukaryotes, the initial characterization of only a limited number of origins did not permit the identification of such a consensus element. In recent years, genome-wide analyses have allowed the identification of replication origins on a larger scale, in the mouse (Sequeira-Mendes et al. 2009; Cayrou et al. 2011, 2012), Drosophila melanogaster (Cayrou et al. 2011), human (Cadoret et al. 2008; Karnani et al. 2010; Mesner et al. 2011; Martin et al. 2011), and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes (Costas et al. 2011). In all these species, replication origins are located at precise sites along the genome. A relationship between CpG islands found at promoters of house-keeping genes and replication origins was identified in human cells (Delgado et al. 1998; Cadoret et al. 2008). Eukaryotic genomes, as with prokaryotes, display asymmetries in the prevalence of G/C over T/A bases in the leading and lagging replication strands. The profile of the calculated base \u201cskew\u201d along the chromosomes reveals characteristic U- and N-shaped patterns whose boundaries are associated with the presence of replication origins (Touchon et al. 2005). A common, unexpectedly G-rich, repeated consensus element named OGRE (for origin G-rich repeated element) was found in mouse and human origins (Cayrou et al. 2011, 2012), a result in contrast with the AT-richness of bacterial and yeast origins. This element that constitutes OGREs includes repeated stretches of guanosine bases, and it was observed that this pattern matches well with the requirements for formation of the alternative nucleic acid structures known as G-quadruplexes (Cayrou et al. 2011, 2012), initiation of DNA synthesis starting at a short, precise distance downstream of these elements (Cayrou et al. 2012). Potential G4s were further detected at origins in human (Besnard et al. 2012) and chicken (Valton et al. 2014), although neither of these two studies showed the corresponding consensus element.",

            "text": "\nG-quadruplexes are structures formed between four G-rich single-stranded stretches of nucleic acid (Lipps and Rhodes 2009). When four guanosine bases are placed in horizontal juxtaposition (typically derived from a single DNA strand looping over several times), they can associate with non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding to form a planar structure known as a G-tetrad. Where three or more G-tetrads stack on top of each other, stabilized by metal cations (in a cellular context, Na+ or K+), this energetically favorable structure is known as a G-quadruplex ( G4\n). In vitro biophysical and structural studies have shown that G4s can form with a variety of G-rich nucleic acids under physiological conditions and may exhibit great structural diversity and flexibility in terms of strand topology (Burge et al. 2006), the size and composition of interstrand loops (Gu\u00e9din et al. 2010), and inter-tetrad bulges (Mukundan and Phan 2013). Bioinformatic analyses revealed that G4 motifs are present with multiple occurrences within the genomes of all organisms tested. In the human genome, G4 motifs are enriched at telomeres, which contain multiple repeats of the sequence (TTAGGG)n, in ribosomal DNA, at immunoglobulin switch regions, and variable number tandem repeats (Davis and Maizels 2011). In the context of genes, motifs peak in promoter regions (Huppert and Balasubramanian 2007), in 5\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs), and at the 5\u2032 ends of introns, the frequency dropping with each successive intron (Maizels and Gray 2013).",

            "text": "Evidence that G4s can regulate replication origins was described using a recombination-based approach in chicken DT40 cells, by introducing specific deletions and mutations in the G4 motif associated with two model origins (Valton et al. 2014). How could the presence of G4s at particular genomic locations contribute to the creation of active origins at proximal loci? Forming an active origin requires the binding of the pre-replication complex ( pre-RC), of which the hexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) is an essential part. Could G4s provide locations on the genome for the binding and loading of ORC hexamers which eventually find their way to the \u201ccorrect\u201d origin sites for pre-RC formation? Some evidence in support of this notion comes from biochemical studies from Hoshina et al. that showed binding can occur between reconstituted recombinant ORC and DNA oligonucleotides containing an \u201cartificial\u201d G-rich repeat such as (GGGTT)n (Hoshina et al. 2013); however, an interaction between a genome-derived G-rich sequence and endogenous ORC has yet to be reported. The binding of ORC to G4s is in agreement with the position of the OGRE/ G4 motif upstream of the initiation site, where the pre-RC complex is likely to form. Recently, analyses of replication origins in different yeast strains interestingly showed that the GC-richness in these sites is not a feature restricted to metazoans: this property is also present in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus (Xu et al. 2012) and the budding yeast Pichia pastoris (Liachko et al. 2014).",

Although already predicted in pioneering studies (Taylor 1977), showing that replication stress can activate new replication origins, then confirmed in yeast models (Friedman et al. 1997), this finding regained interest only in very recent years. Genome-wide analyses performed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Heichinger et al. 2006) and in mouse cells (Cayrou et al. 2011) showed that no more than one third of replication origins were used during each cell cycle in each individual cell. However, the subset of origins used is not the same in each cell. The variation in the choice of origins to be activated in each cell is difficult to determine, because it is currently technically impossible to perform single-cell genome-wide mapping of replication origins. If replication origin activation were mainly stochastic, the choice of the sets of origins to be activated would be based only on the growth conditions and chromosome organization, which also varies from cell to cell (Nagano et al. 2013). In this case, the main requirement would be to have enough replication origins to deal with the cell cycle, without preferential choice. The unused replication origins would serve as spare or dormant origins, to be activated only in the case of fork progression problems (often called replicative stress) due to DNA damage or poor growth conditions (Blow et al. 2011; McIntosh and Blow 2012). Therefore, this excess of replication origins would represent an important genome safeguard mechanism to ensure that the entire genome is duplicated during each cell cycle.",

In this model, the organization of DNA replication origins could be associated with the organization of chromosomal domains for cell fate and cell identity, a process linked to development. DNA replication origins are indeed developmentally regulated in frogs (Callan 1974; Hyrien et al. 1995), as well as in Drosophila cells (Blumenthal et al. 1974; Sasaki et al. 1999). Moreover, the pattern of DNA replication origins can be entirely reprogrammed when differentiated nuclei are exposed to an early embryonic cell context (Lemaitre et al. 2005). This relationship between DNA replication and gene expression programs is in line with recent findings pointing to correlations between DNA replication timing and chromosome structure, organization and position in the nucleus, and also chromatin marks. This relationship might also explain how the memory of ongoing differentiation programs is maintained during successive cell divisions.",

Subsequent studies at higher spatial resolution, using labeling based on the nucleotide analogues bromodeoxyuridine (Nakamura et al. 1986) or biotin-dUTP (Nakayasu and Berezney 1989), combined with fluorescence microscopy, revealed that replication takes place at hundreds of subnuclear sites, which became known as \u201c replication foci,\u201d indicating that this process is subject to tightly controlled compartmentalization.

The nature and composition of fociremains poorly characterized, but indication of the identities of some components has come from the colocalization of various factors required for DNA replication, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Celis and Celis 1985), replication protein A (RPA; Adachi and Laemmli 1992), DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) (Leonhardt et al. 1992), DNA polymerase \u03b1 (Hozak et al. 1993), Cyclin A and Cdk2 (Cardoso et al. 1993; Sobczak-Thepot et al. 1993), and DNA ligase (Montecucco et al. 1995). In contrast, known origin-binding proteins such as the pre-RC components Cdt1, Cdc6, and ORC subunits occasionally show a punctate pattern, but one that does not correspond well to fociof newly synthesized DNA. For Cdc6, MCM7, Orc1, and Orc2, more distinct localization to non-chromatin structures was observed when the nucleus was treated with cross-linking agents before extraction (Fujita et al. 2002), but the colocalization with known replication focus component PCNA is only partial. Together, this points to the foci observed being sites of active replication rather than replication origins themselves.",

Here, the word \u201creplicon,\u201d originally applied to bacteria, has been adapted to fit the context of metazoan replication origins, their interaction, and regulation. A flexible replication unit appears as a series of adjacent potential origins of replication (3\u20134 as a mean), in proximity along the genome, with only one activated in each cell in a given cell cycle, resulting in a mean inter-origin spacing of 100\u2013120 kb. In addition, the activated origin inside this replication unit may vary from cell to cell, even in the same cell population. This flexibility in origin usage within each replication unit is an important characteristic of eukaryotic cells. The basis of origin choice within a given replicon may occur by a stochastic process or may be determined by cell identity or developmental stage (Cayrou et al. 2011).",

As foci remain poorly characterized, this question remains open, and there are several non-mutually exclusive possibilities that may be relevant. One is that replication forks contain proteins that dimerize, promoting self-assembly between adjacent replicons. A second idea is that replication forks are embedded in an as-yet-uncharacterized substance that holds them together. The composition of foci is not known in detail, as it has not yet been possible to physically isolate them from chromatin and other insoluble nuclear structures for analysis by, for example, proteomics. A third idea is that replicons are held together by entrapping the looping DNA of adjacent replicons. Support for this third idea came from a recent study indicating that the cohesin complex may play a key role (Guillou et al. 2010). Cohesin was found to physically interact with the MCM2-7 complex and to show enrichment at origin sites. Depletion of cohesin subunit Rad21 slowed S-phase independently of a checkpoint response and led to a reduction in the intensity but not the number of DNA replication foci and a lengthening of DNA loops. The cohesin complex forms a tripartite ring capable of topologically entrapping two DNA strands, the best-known role for which is holding together duplicated sister chromatids from S-phase until anaphase (Peters et al. 2008; Losada 2014). The use of a similar topological entrapment to hold together DNA strands from neighboring replicon loops is an entirely plausible mechanism by which cohesin could mediate replication focus integrity.",

Importantly, Rif1 depletion also advanced the pattern of timing of origin activation\n: the replication of origins that usually takes place at in mid/late S-phase was advanced to early S-phase.

During G1-phase of the cell cycle, origin sequences become loaded with the replicative helicase, the hexameric MCM2-7 complex, resulting in the formation of the pre-RC (Remus and Diffley 2009). This process, also known as origin , results in origin loading of the MCM2-7 double hexamer in an inactive state. In the second step, replicative helicases become activated resulting in the origin firing. This step, known as pre-initiation complex ( pre-IC) formation, occurs in S-phase and involves a phosphorylation-dependent association of the helicase with additional subunits. The licensing and the activation reactions being separated in the cell cycle, this strongly represses reactivation of origins during S-phase, which would cause genomic amplification and instability (Vaziri et al. 2003; Neelsen et al. 2013). Cells have evolved several overlapping mechanisms to ensure that rereplication processes do not take place (see next section).",

This reaction, which occurs from late mitosis to the end of G1-phase, requires the activity of several essential and conserved proteins. First, origins are recognized by the six-subunit origin recognition complex (Orc1-6) (Fig. 2.1) (Bell and Stillman 1992; Diffley and Cocker 1992). The Orc1-5 subunits possess an AAA+ ATPase domain (Speck et al. 2005); however, Orc1, Orc4, and Orc5 bind ATP (the other subunits have inactivating mutations), and only Orc1 and Orc4 display an essential ATPase activity (Klemm et al. 1997; Bowers et al. 2004). The last ORC subunit Orc6 was shown to be important for pre-RC maintenance in vivo (Semple et al. 2006). To bind DNA, the ORC complex needs to be ATP bound (Klemm and Bell 2001). Cdc6, another essential AAA+ ATPase (Zhou et al. 1989; Cocker et al. 1996), is then recruited to the origin through interaction with the ORC complex (Liang et al. 1995), mainly through Orc1 (Zhou et al. 1989). The loading of the MCM2-7 complex onto chromatin, and thus licensing, requires the essential protein Cdt1 (Maiorano et al. 2000; Nishitani et al. 2000). Cdt1 does not possess enzymatic activity; however, it provides a link between the ORC and MCM2-7 complexes, as it interacts with both (Ferenbach et al. 2005; Chen and Bell 2011). ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by ORC and Cdc6 induces the release of Cdt1 and the formation of the ORC/Cdc6/MCM2-7 complex (OCM). The OCM is then converted to a double hexamer through the action of Cdc6\u2019s ATPase activity (Randell et al. 2006; Remus et al. 2009; Evrin et al. 2009, 2013; Coster et al. 2014; Sun et al. 2014). Multiple rounds of MCM2-7 loading are executed by the ORC complex, which requires the ATPase activity of the Orc1 and Orc4 subunits (Bowers et al. 2004).\n",

Also, CDK-phosphorylated Treslin and RecQ4, in addition to TopBP1 and MCM10, play essential roles in CMG helicase activation (Im et al. 2009; Kumagai et al. 2010, 2011; Boos et al. 2011; Thu and Bielinsky 2013).

            "text": "Several partly overlapping mechanisms exist that repress licensing (Fig. 2.2; see Truong and Wu 2011 for a review). During G1-phase, the ubiquitin ligase APC/CCdh1 is active and induces the degradation of Geminin (McGarry and Kirschner 1998), an inhibitory protein of Cdt1 (Wohlschlegel et al. 2000; Tada et al. 2001), thus allowing licensing to take place. Once S-phase is initiated, APC/CCdh1 is inactivated, permitting the expression of Geminin, resulting in the inhibition of Cdt1. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has also a more direct role in regulating licensing. Indeed, the ubiquitin ligases CRL4Cdt2 targeting Cdt1 (Higa et al. 2003; Hu et al. 2004; Arias and Walter 2006), SCFSkp2 targeting Cdt1 (Li et al. 2003; Nishitani et al. 2006), and Orc1 (Mendez et al. 2002) and APC/CCdh1 targeting Cdc6 and Cdt1 (Petersen et al. 2000; Sugimoto et al. 2008) restrain licensing by targeting their substrates to the proteasome, depending on the cellular context. CDK-mediated phosphorylation of pre-RC components also plays an important role in inhibiting origin licensingonce DNA synthesis is initiated. Protein phosphorylation can affect subcellular localization, as is the case for Orc1 (Saha et al. 2006), Cdc6 (Petersen et al. 1999), and MCM7 (Nguyen et al. 2000), or impairs chromatin association as documented for Cdt1 (Sugimoto et al. 2004; Chandrasekaran et al. 2011; Miotto and Struhl 2011; Coulombe et al. 2013).",

LRWD1 binds Orc2 as well as Cdt1 and Geminin (Shen et al. 2012). The role of LRWD1 seems to be to stabilize the ORC complex on chromatin (Shen et al. 2012), thus allowing licensing. LRWD1 binds epigenetic repressive marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3) (Bartke et al. 2010; Vermeulen et al. 2010; Chan and Zhang 2012) in vitro and is highly enriched in pericentric heterochromatin in an H3K9me3-dependent manner (Chan and Zhang 2012). Interestingly, depletion of LRWD1 or Orc2 induces a derepression of the pericentric region, allowing permissive transcription of major satellite DNA (Chan and Zhang 2012).",

This HAT can acetylate histones H3 and H4 in vitro (Iizuka and Stillman 1999) and is responsible for H3K14 acetylation in vivo (Kueh et al. 2011). HBO1 was later shown to act as a positive cofactor for Cdt1, thus stimulating licensing (Miotto and Struhl 2008). HBO1 was also shown to be essential for pre-RC formation and DNA replication in immunodepletion experiments performed in Xenopus egg extracts (Iizuka et al. 2006). Interestingly, HBO1 was shown to acetylate several pre-RC proteins, suggesting a novel mechanism for regulating licensing (Iizuka et al. 2006). Tethering HBO1 to plasmid DNA stimulates episomal replication in vivo (Chen et al. 2013); however, studies of HBO1 knockout mice did not find a role for this HAT in DNA replication (Kueh et al. 2011).",

TRF2 was shown to associate with Orc1 and be responsible for ORCassociation with telomeres (Deng et al. 2007). Telomeric regions are transcribed, yielding an RNA molecule called TERRA (Azzalin et al. 2007; Luke et al. 2008). This noncoding RNA associates with the TRF2/ORC complex and helps recruit it to telomeres (Deng et al. 2009). At the telomere, ORC complexes play a role in telomere heterochromatin formation and maintenance (Deng et al. 2007). In addition, the presence of the ORC complex at telomeres favors the formation of pre-RCs and thus replication of these difficult-to-replicate regions (Tatsumi et al. 2008). Consistent with its positive role in licensing, TRF2 can also stimulate the replication of the Epstein-Barr virus DS (dyad symmetry) replication origin by promoting the loading of ORC onto chromatin (Atanasiu et al. 2006).",

This reaction requires three essential components for replication initiation: TopBP1/Cut5, Treslin/Ticrr, and RecQ4, the functional vertebrate orthologs of budding yeast Dbp11, Sld3, and Sld2, respectively (Diffley 2010). Sequential steps involving those factors and leading to replication firing in metazoans have been the focus of intense investigations and remain an active field of discovery (see Siddiqui et al. 2013; Tanaka and Araki 2013 for reviews). CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Treslin mediates its interaction with TopBP1, leading to Cdc45 loading onto chromatin (Kumagai et al. 2010, 2011; Boos et al. 2011). In contrast, RecQ4 is recruited onto TopBP1 in a CDK-independent manner. The protein promotes CMG assembly as well as recruitment of DNA polymerase \u03b1 and RPA (Matsuno et al. 2006; Im et al. 2009).",

Interestingly, high PP2A activity in \u201cpost- MBT-like\u201d conditions counteracts the negative regulation of origin activation and thus maintains a high-fired origin rate similar to a pre-MBT replication program. The downstream target(s) of PP2A-dependent firing has not been clearly identified, but ATR would be one good candidate.

Fragile X-related disorders, Huntington\u2019s disease, and myotonic dystrophy are human hereditary diseases characterized by such repeat instability. Oogenesis and early embryonic development seem favorable to repeat expansion in contrast to somatic cells. In fragile X syndrome (FRS), expansion of the (CGG)n repeat motif located in the 5\u2032-UTR of the FRM1 gene has recently been linked to the inactivation of an upstream replication origin, whereas in normal human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), this region is replicated by two flanking origins (Gerhardt et al. 2014a). Interestingly, differentiation of FRS-affected hESCs restores the replication program, providing an explanation for the expansions happening mainly during early embryonic development. Substitution of one thymidine by cytosine in the upstream replication initiation site has been proposed as the genetic determinant by which origin activation is silenced (Gerhardt et al. 2014b), but the molecular mechanisms involved still remain to be elucidated.",

Activation of metazoan origins shares critical functions with epigenetic controls, probably to adapt or coordinate the organization of replication domains to cell-fate specification and patterning during embryonic development. Adaptation of replication origin activation in response to checkpoint controls and DNA damage, treated in other chapters of this book, is another demonstration of the necessary flexibility of origins for the maintenance of genome integrity. Several questions still remain unanswered. At the structural level, how is DNA organized at a replication origin? Are structural components specifically involved in replication foci and the organization of replication origins along the genome? Do some replication proteins have other functions uncoupled from DNA replication itself? Diseases linked to the regulation of replication origins are becoming revealed, but the expected link with some cancers has yet to be clearly established.",

In G1-phase of the cell cycle, origins are recognized by ORC, in an ATP-dependent manner. Cdc6, Cdt1, and the replicative helicase MCM2\u20137 are then recruited onto chromatin. This activates the ATPase activity of ORC and Cdc6, inducing the release of Cdt1 and yielding the OCM complex (ORC/Cdc6/MCM2\u20137). ATP hydrolysis is also important for a second MCM2\u20137 complex to be recruited onto DNA, with the help of Cdt1, thus generating the MCM2\u20137 double hexamer and forming the pre-RC. Additional rounds of ATP-dependent MCM2\u20137 loading take place, forming an extended pre-RC. As cells exit G1- and enter S-phase, CDKs and DDKs become activated and phosphorylate several key factors, including MCM2 and MCM4, Treslin, and RecQ4, leading to the their recruitment to pre-RCs, along with MCM10, Cdc45, TopBP1, and the GINS complex, thus forming the pre-IC",

            "text": "Fig. 2.2: Rereplication and its suppression. During G1-phase, origin licensing is active and pre-RCs are formed at origins. After S-phase is initiated, if the licensing reaction were kept active, origins would be reactivated, leading to the formation of a nested replication bubble. This process, known as rereplication, can be a source of genome instability. Cells have evolved several overlapping mechanisms to ensure that origin licensing and DNA synthesis are temporally separated. First, the APC/C target Geminin binds and inhibits the licensing activity of Cdt1. Second, protein phosphorylation is also important for restraining licensing. Indeed, phosphorylation, mainly mediated by CDK of MCM2\u20137, Cdt1, Orc1, and Cdc6, leads to their functional inactivation. Finally, Cdt1, Orc1, and Cdc6 are subject to ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by the proteasome",

In the pre-MBT stages, replicative helicase loading and its activation is facilitated by an abundance of initiation factors and easy access to chromatin. PP2A might counteract ATR-dependent inhibition of origin firing (red circles). Titration of replication initiation factors contributes to a restriction of origin activation when the N/C ratio (black arrows) reaches a threshold at the MBT. Several mechanisms in post-MBT stages emerge and become dominant, lowering the CDK and DDK activities. Furthermore, epigenetic features modify the activation of the replication program to more restricted sites. Modulation of origin activation during the developmental program can have deleterious effects in origin-poor regions where common fragile sites are located",
