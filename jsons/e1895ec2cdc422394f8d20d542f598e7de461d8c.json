Our objectives were to analyze the distribution of the A and B genotypes over 7 years in Dijon and to investigate a possible association between hMPV genotypes and disease severity. During 2002-2009, we genotyped the 100 isolates from children <3 years old with hMPV. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a change in the distribution of hMPV genotype over the years. Severity was then measured by detailed clinical evaluation. The hospitalization rate was greater when genotype B was involved 72.5% versus 53.3% (P \u00bc 0.054). Those infected with genotype B tended to have a higher clinical score, as measured by Vicente et al. [2006] (P \u00bc 0.07). We showed that, although clinical severity is not clearly associated with hMPV genotype in this study, pathological signs on chest X-ray were observed more often in B subgroup (P < 0.01).",

Higher morbidity is observed in young children, the elderly [Boivin et al., 2002; Falsey et al., 2003; and immunocompromised adults [Sumino et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2005; O'Gorman et al., 2006] . The clinical characteristics of hMPV infection in children range from mild upper respiratory tract to severe lower respiratory tract disease. The main clinical symptoms include rhinorrhea, cough, wheezing, and exacerbation of asthma. hMPV isolates are separated by phylogenetic analysis into two major genotypes (A and B), subdivided in four subgroups (A1, A2, B1, and B2) [Biacchesi et al., 2003; . Subgroup A2 has then been subdivided in two lineages A2a and A2b [Huck et al., 2006b] . Each season, hMPV circulation may vary, and hMPV genotypes circulate simultaneously in variable proportions [Williams et al., 2004; Gerna et al., 2005; Mackay et al., 2006] . In this study, we analyzed the distribution of the two hMPV genotypes and determined whether the clinical characteristics and severity of ARI episodes in children under 3 years of age correlated with a particular genotype.",

The clinical characteristics and severity of illness associated with genotype A and B were compared using one-way analysis' test or Kruskal-Wallis' test for continuous variables and the w 2 -test for categorical data, as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate independence of potential confounding factors on chest radiographs, that is, signs of respiratory distress, chronic respiratory disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and cardiopathy. 1A ). Among the 100 samples, 60% belonged to genotype A and 40% belonged to genotype B: of the 60A, seven were classified as A1 and 53 as A2; of the 40B, 12 were classified as B1 and 28 as B2 (Figs. 2 and 3). For the tree based on the L-gene fragment (Fig. 2) , which combined one third of the sequences, nucleotide identity between groups A and B was 81.4-82.4%, while it was 91.2-96.1% within group A. No B1 sequence was included in this tree, the nucleotide identity within subgroup B2 was 97.1-99.5%. For the tree based on the F-gene fragment (Fig. 3) , nucleotide identity between groups A and B was 83.2-85.1%. Within genotype A, nucleotide identity was 92.7-100%, within subgroup A1 (97.3-99.6%) and within subgroup A2 (96.4-100%); within genotype B, nucleotide identity was (95.0-95.8%), within subgroup B1 (98.9-100%), and within subgroup B2 (97.7-100%). Subgroup A was thus more divergent and the existence of two lineages within subtype A2, labelled A2a and A2b, as recently described by Huck et al. [2006b] , was confirmed. As the PCR on the L gene used at the beginning of the study (2002) (2003) (2004) did not allow us to distinguish lineages, only 27 A2 isolates were classified as either A2a or A2b. Five isolates (24%) belonged to A2a (97.9-99.4%), and 22 isolates (76%) belonged to A2b (98.0-99.6%).

We also report on the domination of the A genotype over the B genotype (60/40). These results are consistent with those of Rafiefard et al. [2008] who also identified hMPV genotypes over a long period (5 years) in Sweden. More precisely, we showed that genotype A predominated from 2002 to 2004, then both genotypes A and B cocirculated. In 2002-2003 a large number of specimens were positive for genotype A in our study as was the case in several countries. This result may be moderated because of the use of a primer set (originally published by Van den Hoogen 2001) located on L gene which has been shown to amplify hMPV strains of the different sublineages with variable sensitivities [Maertzdorf et al., 2004; Sarasini et al., 2006] . The assay on the F gene presented a higher sensitivity (100\u00c2) than the L assay for the four subgroups. The gain in sensitivity obtained with the second pair over the first PCR was probably sufficient to allow the detection of metapneumovirus in children presenting to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and therefore relatively high viral loads, but some B strains may have been missed during the first two seasons.",

A1 cases were no longer reported from 2004 to 2006 Matsuzaki et al., 2008] .

This underlines the fact that the prevalence of B1 was similar worldwide. Similar observations on changes in predominant circulating strains have led to suggestions that there is evasion of pre-existing immunity [Ludewick et al., 2005; Agapov et al., 2006] , which can be attributed to changes in immunity of the population in response to antigenic differences. Despite the stability of lineages over the years, a region of considerable variation (amino acids 260-300) on the fusion protein, analogous to an major antigenic region of the RSV fusion protein, has been identified [Yang et al., 2009] . This relative instability could be a way for the virus to escape the immune response. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the dynamics of the virus population may vary from one genotype to another and from one year to another depending on environmental factors.",

Distinction between A2b and A2a strains was reported during one season in Croatia 2005 /2006 [Ljubin-Sternak et al., 2008 . In our study, RT-PCR analysis of the F fragment gene used from 2004 to 2009 allowed us to show that A2a and A2b were prevalent during this period and co-circulated. A majority of isolates belonged to subgroup A2b. At the end of the study, one isolate was on a separate branch from A2a and A2b. It may represent a new variant within genotype A and may signify an attempt of the virus to escape the current immune response of the population. Percentages are given relative to cases of A1, A2, B1, or B2 subgroups. For the following item, radiological signs in chest, only children who had a chest X-ray have been taken into account.

None reported any significant differences between clinical data according to genotypes [Agapov et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006; Vicente et al., 2006 ]. However, a difference in the severity index as well as in the diagnosis of pneumonia was reported [Vicente et al., 2006] , suggesting that hMPV genotype A may be more pathogenic than hMPV genotype B. Although we studied the same population, that is children <3 years old, and applied the same severity index as described by Vicente, we did not find a correlation between genotype and severity score. The conclusion of these studies, which included a large number of strains was that there is no clear link between viral genotype and susceptibility to more severe hMPV infection. Our study was based on metapneumovirus, and most of the main causes of coinfections, namely RSV, Flu, and PI, were excluded. We did not test for human bocavirus, adenoviruses, coronavirus, and rhinoviruses. We probably missed some co-infections, but the clinical impact of viral coinfection involving hMPV and these viruses is unclear. Sloots et al. [2006] found no significant difference in disease severity between hMPV infected patients with a coinfection and those without. Only hMPV-RSV dual infections are thought to be more severe [Semple et al., 2005 ].",

We did not find any difference in asthma between children infected with hMPV genotype A and children infected with genotype B. However, when we compared the four subgroups, asthma was only observed in patients with subgroup A2 and B2. Rhinoviruses are frequently associated with LRTD and asthmatic exacerbations. We found no significant difference regarding asthma according to genotype, but we cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of another virus, in particular rhinovirus, contributed to this clinical presentation. Recently, Matsuzaki et al. [2008] compared the clinical characteristics of A2, B1, and B2 hMPV infections for 85 outpatients under 15 years old over three seasons and showed that wheezing was statistically less frequent in A2 than in B1 and B2. They also reported a higher frequency of laryngitis in children with B1.",

However, no clear relationship between one hMPV genotype and disease severity has been established. One possibility could be that the virulence is maintained by evolution in subgroup predominance, leading to progression from rather mild infections often due to the A1 subgroup to lower RTI mainly due to A2 and B2. However, other factors such as the viral load [Bosis et al., 2008] may be involved in disease severity. Investigation of a large panel of isolates as well as predicting factors of illness severity are required to gain insights into the molecular epidemiology of hMPV and viral pathogenesis.",
