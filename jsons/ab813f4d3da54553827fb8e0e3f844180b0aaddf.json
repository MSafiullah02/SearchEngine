Academic leaders across the United States have responded by moving their educational and associated activities online; as a sense of immediacy swept the nation. The decision to pivot to remote learning was made swiftly, particularly by those institutions operating a shared leadership model, benefitting from a greater degree of agility, innovation, and collaboration. The current article highlights three of the leadership best practices for navigating unpredictable adaptive challenges such as that posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Firstly, by utilizing a type of servant leadership, that emphasizes empowerment, involvement, and collaboration, academic leaders with emotional intelligence and emotional stability should place the interests of others above their own. Secondly, academic leaders should distribute leadership responsibilities to a network of teams throughout the organization to improve the quality of the decisions made in crisis resolution and thirdly, leaders should communicate clearly and frequently to all stakeholders through a variety of communication channels. Looking forward, the rise of the flexible \"allostatic leader\" with the adaptive capacity to learn and evolve in crisis, to emerge better able to address future crises, is described.",

It is one of the most significant and unpredictable global public health crises in recent times, and according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is contagious and deadly, disproportionally affecting the elderly and those with chronic underlying disease (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) . In the United States, the number of individuals infected with and dying from novel coronavirus infection is increasing rapidly, even as significant measures are taken to slow the nationwide spread of the pandemic. In academia, those in leadership positions at schools, colleges, and universities throughout the United States have responded to the crisis by closing campuses and residence halls, canceling commencements and moving their educational and associated activities online; as a sense of immediacy sweeps across the nation. The general public is staying home in often self-imposed quarantine, practicing social distancing to \"flatten the curve\" of nationwide transmission, since social distancing has previously been shown in modeling studies to reduce the transmission of the influenza virus in dense community settings, such as schools and colleges (Ahmed, Zviedrite, & Uzicanin, 2018) . The coronavirus pandemic represents a serious and immediate adaptive challenge that can best be solved by all those impacted working together and thinking of others to slow the spread of the disease. Although leadership practitioners in academe (and elsewhere) have a crucial role in the response of their institution to crises, in reality, the role of campus leaders in establishing a culture of trust, collaboration, and shared leadership prior to a crisis, will more significantly, influence the ability of the institution to withstand times of crisis (Kezar, Fries-Britt, Kurban, McGuire, & Wheaton, 2018) .",

            "text": "Faced with the uncertainty and growing intensity of the novel coronavirus pandemic, academic leaders in schools, colleges, and universities throughout the United States made the strategic decision to transition to remote learning. The decision to pivot to remote teaching and learning has required new transformative learning for all stakeholders and serious adaptive work that is stressful, since many academic institutions lack the necessary digital infrastructure. Transitioning to online course delivery may require radical changes in attitude, values, and beliefs for some stakeholders (Heifetz & Laurie, 2001) and it may also require process enhancements, new strategies, and even new ways of doing business for many. The decision by leadership practitioners to transition to remote education was made swiftly, prompted by social distancing practices, although some faculty were disgruntled because they were not consulted in the decision-making process. However, a rapid response from leadership was essential for effective crisis management, and it sent a clear message to all stakeholders that leadership understood that the coronavirus represented a significant problem, and that they were taking it seriously, and were taking steps to address it (Garcia, 2006) . The rapidity of the transition to remote learning response comes counter to the perception that changes in academia occur only at glacial speed! The rapid response of some academic institutions to the present crisis was facilitated by the existence of authentic systems of shared leadership enabling local decision making . Institutions operating a shared leadership model have benefitted from a greater degree of agility, innovation, and collaboration and now benefit from superior peer-support in a crisis than is possible in institutions clinging to an outdated and inflexible hierarchical leadership paradigm; the leader/follower binary model of leadership . These traditional models of autocratic leadership are adequate when faced with technical problems, but faced with the complexities and uncertainties of the coronavirus pandemic that necessitates dealing with problems in real time; they are inadequate, putting these institutions at a strategic disadvantage. The transition from an authoritarian leader/follower leadership paradigm to a new shared leadership model on campuses cannot happen overnight. However, in response to a crisis, supportive vertical or hierarchical leaders may implement a type of distributed leadership in which different individuals, at different levels, cross organizational boundaries to exert creative influence in times of change .",

Academic leaders, who remain authentic, will be able to motivate faculty of the ambivalent majority, previously resistant to any form of technology-enhanced teaching to attend these workshops. Nonetheless, many in academia are in uncharted territory; faculty, staff, and students, now working remotely are stressed, uncertain and even afraid in their new reality with their wellestablished teaching and learning routines disrupted. Empathy, compassion, and flexibility are in order, and appropriate leader behaviors matched to the context of crisis management in academia will be crucial (Doraiswamy, 2012) .",

Although some faculty, driven by their intrinsic willingness to innovate, has quickly developed serviceable online course offerings, academic leadership should manage faculty expectations. These hastily assembled online course offerings cannot all be perfect, and some may even be mediocre. However, those academic leaders capable of leveraging the skills and talents of the campus collective, by wielding a distributed situational leadership style (Harris, 2010) will allow faculty to perform at high levels. A distributed leadership style encourages collaboration and inclusivity, and according to long-established leadership theory (Kerr & Jermier, 1978) works well in academia where followers are experienced, knowledgeable and intrinsically motivated. Faculty may be capable of building better quality online course offerings that establish a community of learners capable of working together to overcome the teaching and learning challenges posed by the current coronavirus crisis, when leadership is decentralized. These courses will leverage various digital learning technologies to promote interaction, the key to effective online learning and ironically the antithesis of social distancing.",

It is a time for academic leaders courageous enough to disrupt longstanding patterns of behavior, to challenge opinions and organizational norms, and disrupt the status quo. These leaders can successfully navigate the transition to remote learning with flexibility, understanding, and compassion. Looking forward, once the current crisis is over, and it will end, since the present disruption is only temporary, academic leaders will be presented with a dilemma as they rebuild. What to do with these makeshift online course offerings, rolled out in an emergency to get through the semester? Will they be refined and sustained in a new reshaped reality or discarded as a used band-aid? Academic leaders with the adaptive capacity (Heifetz & Laurie, 2001) to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise may now redefine organizational responsibilities by disruptive innovation and employ digital technologies to alter or eliminate inefficient legacy practices. Perhaps the digital resources produced in response to the crisis may be employed to assist disadvantaged students, those with physical and learning disabilities or in vocational course design for non-traditional students returning to education once the crisis subsides.",

In the article, three of the leadership best practices for academic leaders navigating a crisis are considered. These best practices are; connecting with people as individuals and establishing mutual trust, distributing leadership throughout the organization and communicating clearly and often with all stakeholders. Although these best practices are described here in the context of academic institutions pivoting to remote instruction, faced with the current novel coronavirus pandemic, they may equally be applied by practitioners operating in other industries facing their own crises. Since connecting with people and establishing mutual trust, as well as transitioning to a shared leadership paradigm can take time, those in leadership positions should prioritize these responsibilities immediately upon accepting the position rather than waiting for a crisis to arrive.

However, in a crisis, perhaps the most important of all is emotional intelligence and emotional stability that will allow the academic leader to place the interests of others above their own in servant leadership (Doraiswamy, 2012) . Servant leadership that emphasizes empowerment, involvement, and collaboration is a particularly effective form of leadership in faith-based schools, colleges, and universities (Wheeler, 2012) and it is a leadership style that becomes more critical in a crisis (Doraiswamy, 2012) . Faced with the present novel coronavirus pandemic, academic leaders had to quickly overcome any lingering normalcy bias that they may have harbored, and quickly assess their current reality in which students, faculty, and staff are experiencing genuine difficulties in their everyday life. Following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, faculty, staff, and students at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana experienced considerable disruption to their daily routines in the aftermath of the storm. In their response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, leadership at Tulane was determined to focus on the welfare and safety of their faculty, staff, and students as their top priority, as they also transitioned to remote teaching and learning, and shut down campuses (Cowen, 2020) .",

On campuses where there can be a culture of mutual distrust and a divide between faculty and administration, now is the time to set distrust aside (Dever & Justice, 2020) and leverage the benefits of genuine shared governance. Academic leaders on senate committees with oversight of distance learning and information technology initiatives can profitably engage with campus administration to the benefit of the student population. Academic leaders can build relationships by inquiring, advocating, and connecting (Ancona, Malone, Orlikowski, & Senge, 2007) with individuals as people first, to gain their perspectives while leveraging the many benefits of diversity and establishing a mutual trust. Without mutual trust, there can be no transformative change. Some academic leaders may even use the crisis as a catalyst to re-establish dormant relationships, and reach out to establish new relationships with those who hold contrary views, those from the ambivalent majority, as well as those considered confidants, who can often provide a genuine reality check for the academic leader. Making connections with people at all levels of the institution during a crisis, allows the leader to be truly transformative and the collaboration to be meaningful (Fernandez & Shaw, 2020) .",

In a crisis, leaders may be called upon to resolve interpersonal and task-related conflicts as they arise, though they should encourage healthy debate and conflict as appropriate, providing that it is functional (Robbins & Judge, 2018) . Investing in relationships during a crisis will strengthen the bond between students, faculty, and staff and the institution; an investment that will be repaid in full, once the crisis passes, since relationships forged in a crisis by meaningful engagement can become long-term and consequential when the crisis subsides (Kezar et al., 2018) .",

Therefore, the leader should be initially responsible for identifying the impending crisis as such, and setting institutional priorities before leveraging the collective knowledge of the campus community. Once these institutional priorities have been established, these leaders should delegate leadership responsibilities to a network of multi-disciplinary teams or task forces that will have a significant role in the implementation of the crisis management strategy. Ideally, an academic leader would select team members based not only on member skills, but on their character traits. The big five character traits of conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness are generally preferred in team members (John & Srivastava, 1999) . Additionally, the academic leader may consider diversity and cultural differences in team construction.",

By distributing leadership responsibilities, the teams remain motivated and incentivized since they have more latitude in problem solving than would be the case on a campus operating a top-down leadership model. Provided with adequate resources, these teams should be allowed to operate in a climate of trust, established throughout the institution in a crisis, and engage in problem solving, innovation and change. Because of the nature of the current crisis, these teams operate virtually, at a distance from the main campus, employing a variety of technologies to connect physically dispersed team members. A remote working model allows teams to be constructed based on the skills and abilities of the team members rather than on geographical proximity (Robbins & Judge, 2018) . The ability of teams to successfully accomplish their role is related to their distributed situational awareness (Sorensen & Stanton, 2013) , and thus the leader must trust these teams to address the crisis with a moral purpose and implement solutions. Academic leaders should avoid micromanaging these teams that will utilize a shared leadership model to pursue a common purpose; to maintain a quality student learning experience throughout the crisis without disruption. Having formed a network of teams in response to the crisis, these teams can work toward a response; they may refocus as appropriate and disband with crisis resolution. Upon crisis resolution, teams can disband with a sense of accomplishment haven risen to the challenges presented by the crisis and their work may, in fact, yield tangible long-term benefits.",

Communication media vary in their richness, and when the information is important as it is in the current crisis, more than one communication channel should be used (Robbins & Judge, 2018) . In the current crisis, unable to communicate face-to-face because of social distancing practices, leaders should consider the live streaming of updates or messages of encouragement to stakeholders. The choice of communication channel selected by leadership should also consider stakeholder preferences and thus communication with employees and students may utilize different channels. Faculty and staff may prefer updates from leadership through email, while students, many of whom are millennials, may prefer to receive their updates through a variety of social medium platforms (or text message), relatively lean communication channels. Following Hurricane Katrina, Tulane leadership utilized a variety of messaging tools, apps, and social media to communicate with all stakeholders to build a sense of community, belonging and trust and reduce anxiety (Cowen, 2020) . All communications from Tulane leadership in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina balanced reality with hope and empathy, while looking for silver linings in the crisis (Cowen, 2020) . In response to the current coronavirus pandemic, Rice University is now crafting messages centrally, to ensure consistency, while customizing them for specific audiences (Field, 2020) . Communication in a crisis is a delicate balancing act; too much and the message is tuned out, too little may prompt concern and anxiety (Field, 2020).",

The process of communicating a compelling vision of the future has been described as visioning, and it is a dynamic and collaborative process (Ancona et al., 2007) . The leader's articulated strategic vision should be aligned with organizational goals and consistent with the institutional mission to reassure all stakeholders that they are following the situation, and have a strategy in place for crisis resolution. Leaders must communicate how strategy establishes the mission and vision of the institution and execute on the strategy with resolve, adjusting appropriately as more information and the effect of their actions become known. There should be a transparency to the actions of the academic leader in a crisis so that the campus community is clear on the direction the institution is heading.",
