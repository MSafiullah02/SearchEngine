Climate changes, the international migration of people and products, deforestation, and other anthropogenic activities (and their consequences) have been historically and continuously related to the emerging and re-emerging of new viruses, triggering an increasing number of notified outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. In this very popular Special Issue (Emerging Viruses: Surveillance, Prevention, Evolution, and Control), we are proud to have received a total of 70 manuscript submissions, with an acceptance rate 54.29% (38 papers) from colleagues from different parts of the world, working on a wide range of topics.",

Interestingly, a considerable number of articles discussing diversity, transmission, and pathogenesis of human and animal infection by respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses, draws the attention of those who follow this issue. Coronaviruses, in particular, are addressed in three papers. Kandeil et al. [1] demonstrate a high seroprevalence of MERS coronavirus in adult dromedary camels from Asia and Africa, and Alsaadi et al. [2] characterize a fusion peptide in the spike protein of MERS-CoV. Avian coronaviruses are also addressed in the article from Fan et al. [3], which reveals the changes in genetic diversity, dominant genotypes, and selection pressure on the bronchitis virus (IBV) circulating in yellow chickens in China.",

            "text": "A few papers access genetic and pathogenic features of avian influenza viruses, which have caused important outbreaks of different bird species and serious losses to the poultry industry, besides being associated to sporadic human infections. Yeo et al. [4] present the characterization of a novel avian influenza A (H2N9) from a wild duck in Korea. Song et al. [5] isolate H5N6 isolates from waterfowls in China, which appear to be multi-reassortant among different genotypes of avian influenza viruses. They demonstrate relevant host\u2013virus features in chickens and mice, including systemic replication and contact transmission between chickens, and upregulation of PRR in different organs in chicken and mice. Mei et al. [6] also reveal that goose-origin H5N6 avian influenza viruses have different pathogenicity and transmissibility in chickens. Yu et al. [7] present a comparative analysis between highly and low pathogenic H7N9 AIV strains. They show that both virus isolates were shed through respiratory and digestive routes in inoculated chickens and could be transmitted to na\u00efve animals; however, the emerging H7N9 highly-pathogenic avian influenza presents a stronger pathogenicity and transmissibility. Sun et al. [8] present data on the H9N2 avian influenza viruses currently circulating in South China and Song et al. [9] compare biological and genetic features of three H9N2 avian influenza in chicken and mice models, showing that different isolates may have distinct replication and transmissibility efficiencies.
