The ethical considerations related to forced quarantine impinges on the rights of individuals to protect the wellbeing of the greater public, in an effort to curb an epidemic, a pandemic or to ensure that neither starts. In these situations, ethical conflicts are bound to occur because public health and the safety of the community often trumps individual rights. This chapter will examine the ethical questions pertaining to public health ethics that arose from the Ebola outbreak of 2014/2015. During the outbreak, it is said that the United States of America went through extraordinary lengths to give two tow of it citizens, experimental drugs, outfit a plane with an incubation pod and monitors; airlift them out of the \"red zone\" to a special, ward at Emory University hospital which houses the most sophisticated infectious disease unit in the United States. Many people were outraged that the individual rights of these two citizens appeared to be more important than that of the public. The fear of Ebola Virus Disease spreading in the country turned to hate mail hurled at doctors at Emory. (Usborne 2014) . The practice of forced quarantine will be a focus of the discussions as the risks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases increase with modern travel that transports people, to different continents within a few hours via airplanes, ships and trains that cross borders at exceedingly increasing speeds. With this \"speed travel\" comes the speed of rapid transport of communicable, infectious diseases, bio-hazards and toxic, biological agents; across borders. In the United States of America, rules and regulations that govern the use of quarantine are in place to safeguard the public against the transmission of infectious diseases to the general public.",

There were inconsistent regulations on quarantine until the exchange of information and the establishment of international health organizations (Aginam 2002) .

It was on the island of Santa Maria di Nazareth. In 1467, the system in Venice was adopted by Genoa (Tognotti 2013) . The origin of the word \"quarantine\" is said to be from Venetian Italian and a variant of the term \"quaranta giorni\" which was used as a designated period of 40 days that ships were isolated before crew and passengers could come ashore during the Plague and Black Death (CDC n.d.) . Quarantine is government enforced and can apply to humans, animals and can be used at borders or within countries. Clearly, this is the historical perspective of quarantine from a global north perspective. Isolation is when a sick person is kept separate from others. This differs from quarantine where people who have been exposed but are not ill, are separated from the general public.",

Although there are no accurate statistics on the population of Lagos, in 2016, the National Population Commission of Nigeria, stated that the population of Lagos was over 21 million. Lagos became the largest city on the continent of Africa, surpassing Cairo back in 2012 (World Population Review n.d.). Patrick Sawyer arrived in Lagos with the intention to proceed to Calabar, Nigeria, for a government conference. Some reports state that he was seeking the healing ministry of one of the Nigerian pastors, in Calabar, because he knew he was sick and possibly had Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Mr. Sawyer's actions were reported to have been deliberate; as he reportedly evaded health warnings and the health protocols for the spread of infectious disease and lied to the staff at the hospital about not having contact with anyone who had EVD. Patrick Sawyer had nursed his sick sister who was confirmed to have EVD. She later succumbed to the disease. According to Patrick Sawyer's wife, he evaded contact with people at the Monrovia airport. In an interview with Mrs. Sawyer, she stated that her husband travelled to Nigeria because of the better health system. He knew he was ill and wanted to be treated (Mai-Duc 2014). Patrick Sawyer was the index case, (the first known case) of EVD in Nigeria. Professionally, Patrick Sawyer was a lawyer and the National Public Health Officer for Arcelor-Mittal, headquartered in Luxembourg. Patrick Sawyer was a naturalized American citizen with his family residence in the state of Minnesota, although he was consulting for the government of Liberia, at the time (Mai-Duc 2014). Information regarding Mr. Sawyer's education and social status is worthy of note, as it rules out the case of a person who may not know or understand the lethal and highly infectious nature of EVD. Against this backdrop, one can only assume that Patrick Sawyer, as the public health officer knew he was not supposed to travel and therefore should have quarantined himself to avoid exposing others to risk of contracting EVD.",

Considering the social, health and psychological impact the Sawyer case had in Lagos and Nigeria at large, there is no doubt that the potential benefits for self-quarantine would certainly have outweighed by far, the individual rights of Mr. Sawyer. However, the debate on whether or not one should self-quarantine themselves is more complex than what many can imagine. For example, in the event that a person does not self-quarantine, important questions may arise about the ethical considerations for having that person under mandatory quarantine in an effort to protect the public from the spread of an outbreak? In the event that mandatory quarantine is considered, questions may equally arise regarding infringing and violating their individual rights? At face value, these questions and considerations may sound simple, yet too complex to resolve!",

The Liberian government were at a loss as to how to contain the outbreak and the decision to cordon off this community, a week after the government had declared the outbreak a public health emergency, did not go well with the international community. West Point, a lower socio-economic slum of about 800,000 people, came under strict military enforced quarantine after a holding center for suspected Ebola disease victims was ransacked. Seventeen suspected EVD patients escaped; mattresses and infected materials were stolen. The government of Liberia felt the need for barbed wire and wooden checkpoints to go up around West Point. In a Time magazine interview, President Johnson-Sir leaf cited the attack on the holding center as the reason for the quarantine. She further went on to say that the attack \"put the entire community at risk, hence the government had to protect them from themselves.\" (MacDougal 2014). President Johnson-Sirleaf was making reference to the residents of West Point.",

There were many scuffles with the police and West Point residents threw bottles and stones at the authorities, attempting to escape the makeshift checkpoints. Liberian security forces opened fire on the rioting crowd and killed a 15-year-old, Shakie Kamara, 3 wounding two other teenagers in the resulting melee. There was no autopsy performed on Shakie Kamara and the Ministry of Defence forces took possession of his body (MacDougall 2014). The quarantine imposed area was cordoned off for a total of 10 days (Butty 2014 ). On Friday, August 30th, the quarantine was lifted amongst much jubilation.",

Governor LaPage (Maine) stated that the judge put Kaci Hickox rights above public safety. (Nicks 2014) .",

It would ensure that when a quarantine is imposed,people have access to liberty and due process (Santora 2017) , in addition to the basic necessities such as water and food. It would also be critical to ensure the people have access to health care that would curtail the spread of the communicable diseases to others within a population. The strengths of quarantine lie in the power of the state to impose it. However, the flip side of this is that it can be a weakness as it is important to have checks and balances such as a committee made up of multiple heads of institutions saddled with the responsibility of engaging those affected at various levels, rather than one person or entity making unilateral decisions. This would keep the balance of fairness. The United States has a federal law and institutions such as the Center for Disease Control (CDC) which have been authorized to take action in the event of quarantine. Africa now has an organization as the African Union and the CDC partnered to form the new Africa CDC (Africa CDC 2017). The strategy for Africa and quarantine is that it has to embody the African culture and must include stakeholder engagement. Failure to do so will result in a failed quarantine that could cost the public dearly.",

Lack of community and stakeholder sensitization can create tensions between the government and the affected community, human rights activities and civil societies who may resist a potentially beneficial intervention. Community engagement should be considered to avoid unnecessary tension.

Survivors often experienced psychosocial trauma such as feelings of guilt, isolation and shame, as well as stigmatization.

(Kass 2014) . This individualistic view examines considerations that focus on autonomy while public health ethics supports the rights of the community. Essentially, everyone has a right to life. While the experience of life differs dramatically between different contexts, there is a general appreciation that optimal quality of life should comprize of a healthy life, free from disease, including any form of physical and psychological distress. Against this backdrop, every human being, regardless of their socioeconomic background, ought to have an optimal life experience. Health care provides a means towards restoring the divergent quality of life to its optimal standard. Unfortunately, this was never the case during the EVD outbreak. The outbreak saw numerous cases where individuals from specific nationals received preferential treatment over others. Thus, individuals from well-resourced countries, those who were affluent or who came from wealthy families were more likely to receive the best quality of health care compared to the poor black persons from resource-poor countries where the health systems were already dilapidated and severely constrained. In fact, it is fair to say that the outbreak exposed the pathetic disparities that exist between the well resourced and poor resourced countries and individuals more profound.",

Since there are no logs or manuscripts chronicling the journey of self, persona and humanness; disease and death, this can only be found in African philosophy and evidenced by the way the African people live and breathe, the essence of African \"ness\" and how they perceive themselves. Although traditional African societies have been eroded by the Western values, health had a high value and this value was what made other avenues in life possible (Tangwa 2000) . Quarantine within the West African context also falls right in the middle of treading within the delicate balance of tradition and cultural, vis-a-vis public health. For example, the way Africans perceive the concept of health and illness, death and the dying and personhood, as a whole differ, significantly from the public health construct, which borrows heavily from the western epistemology. Despite its good intentions, quarantine is likely to create tensions with individual rights as well as general African culture and traditions.",

Ethical considerations related to public health can be seen through two main views. These views are from that of the healthcare worker and the associated professionality of that worker. Ethical considerations in regards to public health and the practice of quarantine primarily centers on the loss of freedom for the individual being quarantined. West Africa is a region that is susceptible to emerging infectious diseases. It is crucial that the region examines its surveillance system, restrictions concerning biological specimens, and has a true model to ensure that fairness and equity prevails. The quarantine of West Point under military guard is an example of how leaders make decisions against international advice, out of fear and disregard for people of lower economic classes who are helpless and do not have a voice. The decision to impose a mandatory, military enforced quarantine at a time of such fear; interrupted livelihoods of people who were already at a serious economic disadvantage some of whom are yet to recover. A lot has happened in the field of Public health since the Ebola outbreak of 1976, in the Central African nation of Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo), in a remote rainforest and a village known as Yambuku, when Peter Piot discovered the Ebola virus and provided epidemiological evidence of the path of the virus. (Boseley 2014) . The examples shared in this chapter, show how an outbreak can spill over to neighbouring towns, villages and countries, like the situation with both Patrick Sawyer who flew to Lagos, Nigeria and Thomas Duncan who flew to Texas, United States.",
