In 2011, worldwide there were over 800 new biotech drugs and treatments in development including 23 antisense, 64 cell therapy, 50 gene therapy, 300 monoclonal antibodies, 78 recombinant proteins, and 298 vaccines (PhRMA 2012 ). Pharmaceutical biotechnology techniques are at the core of most methodologies used today for drug discovery and development of both biologics and small molecules. While recombinant DNA technology and hybridoma techniques were the major methods utilized in pharmaceutical biotechnology through most of its historical timeline, our ever-widening understanding of human cellular function and disease processes and a wealth of additional and innovative biotechnologies have been, and will continue to be, developed in order to harvest the information found in the human genome. These technological advances will provide a better understanding of the relationship between genetics and biological function, unravel the underlying causes of disease, explore the association of genomic variation and drug response, enhance pharmaceutical research, and fuel the discovery and development of new and novel biopharmaceuticals. These revolutionary technologies and additional biotechnology-related techniques are improving the very competitive and costly process of drug development of new medicinal agents, diagnostics, and medical devices. Some of the technologies and techniques described in this chapter are both well established and commonly used applications of biotechnology producing potential therapeutic products now in development including clinical trials. New techniques are emerging at a rapid and unprecedented pace and their full impact on the future of molecular medicine has yet to be imagined.",

In the 1980s and 1990s, biotechnology techniques produced novel therapeutics and a wealth of information about the mechanisms of various diseases such as cancer at the genetic and molecular level, yet the etiologies of other complex diseases such as obesity and heart disease remained poorly understood. Recently, however, researchers utilizing exciting and groundbreaking \"omic\" technologies and working closely with clinicians have begun to make serious progress not only toward a molecular-level understanding of the etiology of complex diseases but to clearly identify that there are actually many genetically different diseases called by the single name of cancer, diabetes, depression, etc. Later in this chapter, we will explore the concepts of phenotype. Important here is that most human diseases are manifested through very complex phenotypes that result from genetic, environmental, and other factors. In a large part, the answers were hidden in what was unknown about the human genome. Despite the increasing knowledge of DNA structure and function in the 1990s, the genome, the entire collection of genes and all other functional and nonfunctional DNA sequences in the nucleus of an organism, had yet to be sequenced. DNA may well be the largest, naturally occurring molecule known. Successfully meeting the challenge of sequencing the entire human genome is one of history's great scientifi c achievements and heralds enormous potential (Venter et al. 2001 ; International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium 2001 ) . While the genetic code for transcription and translation has been known for years, sequencing the human genome provides a blueprint for all human proteins and the sequences of all regulatory elements that govern the developmental interpretation of the genome. The potential signifi cance includes identifying genetic determinants of common and rare diseases, providing a methodology for their diagnosis, suggesting interesting new molecular sites for intervention (see Fig. 8 .1 ), and the development of new biotechnologies to bring about their eradication. Unlocking the secrets of the human genome may lead to a paradigm shift in clinical practice toward true targeted molecular medicine, better disease taxonomy, and patient-personalized therapy.",

While it is a complex and complicated journey from DNA sample to DNA sequence stored in a database, a multitude of technologies and approaches along with impressive enhancements in instrumentation and computation have been employed to sequence genomic DNA faster and less expensively. While many industry analysts predicted a tripling of pharmaceutical R&D productivity due to the sequencing of the human genome, it is the \"nextgeneration\" genome sequencing technology and the quest for the \"$1000 genome\" that will move genomic technology effectively into the clinic (Davies 2010 ) .",

Structural genomics intersects the techniques of DNA sequencing, cloning, PCR, protein expression, crystallography, and big data analysis. It focuses on the physical aspects of the genome through the construction and analysis of gene sequences and gene maps. Proposed in the late 1980s, the publicly funded Human Genome Project (HGP) or Human Genome Initiative (HGI) was officially sanctioned in October 1990 to map the structure and to sequence human DNA (US DOE 2012a ). As described in Table 8 .1 , HGP structural genomics was envisioned to proceed through increasing levels of genetic resolution: detailed human genetic linkage maps [approximately 2 megabase pairs (Mb = million base pairs) resolution], complete physical maps (0.1 Mb resolution), and ultimately complete DNA sequencing of the approximately three billion base pairs (23 pairs of chromosomes) in a human cell nucleus [1 base pair (bp) resolution]. Projected for completion in 2003, the goal of the project was to learn not only what was contained in the genetic code but also how to \"mine\" the genomic information to cure or help prevent the estimated 4,000 genetic diseases affl icting humankind. The project would identify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in human DNA, determine the base pair sequence and store the information in databases, create new tools and improve existing tools for data analysis, and address the ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI) that may arise from the project. Earlier than projected, a milestone in genomic science was reached on June 26, 2000, when researchers at the privately funded Celera Genomics and the publicly funded International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (the international collaboration associated with the HGP) jointly announced that they had completed sequencing 97-99 % of the human genome. The journal Science rates the mapping of the human genome as its \"breakthrough of the year\" in its December 22, 2000, issue.",

Each DNA segment was further divided or blasted into smaller fragments. Each small fragment was individually sequenced and the sequenced fragments assembled according to their known relative order. The Celera researchers employed a \"whole shotgun\" approach where they broke the whole genome into small fragments.

The challenge for genomic scientists is to discover the full extent of genomic structural variation, referred to as genotyping, so that the variations and genetic coding may be associated with the encoded trait or traits displayed by the organism (the phenotype). And they wish to do this using as little DNA material as possible, in as short time and for the least cost, all important characteristics of a useful pointof-care clinical technology. The discovery and genotyping of structural variation has been at the core of understanding disease associations as well as identifying possible new drug targets (Alkan et al. 2011 ) . DNA sequencing effi ciency has facilitated these studies. In the decade since the completion of the HGP, sequencing effi ciency has increased by approximately 100,000fold and the cost of a single genome sequence has decreased from nearly $1 million in 2007 to $1,000 just recently (Treangen and Salzberg 2011 ) . The move toward low-cost, high-throughput sequencing is essential for the implementation of genomics into personalized medicine and will likely alter the future clinical landscape. Next-generation genome sequencing methodologies, which differ from the original cloningbased Sanger technique, are high-throughput, imaging-based systems with vastly increased speeds and data output. There is no clear defi nition for next-generation genome sequencing, also known generally as NGS , but most are characterized by the direct and parallel sequencing of large numbers of amplifi ed and fragmented DNA without vector-based cloning. The fragmented DNA tends to have sequence reads of 30-400 base pairs. There are now numerous examples of single-molecule techniques utilizing commercially available DNA sequencers (Cherf et al. 2012 ; Woollard et al. 2011 ) . Early in 2012, the DNA sequencing companies Illumina and Life Technologies each announced new products that can sequence an entire human genome in 1 day for approximately $1,000 (BusinessWeek 2012 ).",

For example, it has become well known that women who inherit a gene mutation of the BRCA1 gene have a high risk, perhaps as high as 85 %, of developing breast cancer before the age of 50 (Petrucelli et al. 2011 ) . The fi rst diagnostic product generated from genomic data was the BRCA1 test for breast cancer predisposition.

Evidence has accumulated suggesting that the Rad9 protein of S. cerevisiae is distantly, but signifi cantly, related to the BRCA1 protein. The fruit fl y possesses a gene similar to p53 , the human tumor suppressor gene. Studying C. elegans , an unsegmented vermiform, has provided much of our early knowledge of apoptosis, the normal biological process of programmed cell death.

Detection of or concentration change of a biomarker may indicate a particular disease state (e.g., the presence of a certain antibody may indicate an infection), physiology, or toxicity. A change in expression or state of a protein biomarker may correlate with the risk or progression of a disease, with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment or the drug's safety profi le. Implemented in the form of a medical device, a measured biomarker becomes an in vitro diagnostic tool (Williams et al. 2006 ) . While it is well beyond this chapter to provide a detailed discussion of biomarkers, it is important to note that omic technologies including omic-enabled technologies such as microarrays are being developed as clinical measuring devices for biomarkers. Biomarkers enable characterization of patient populations undergoing clinical trials or drug therapy and may accelerate drug development. Modern drug discovery often simultaneously involves biomarker discovery and diagnostic development (Frank and Hargreaves 2003 ) . Drug development scientists are hopeful that the development of appropriate biomarkers will facilitate \"go\" and \"no go\" decisions during a potential therapeutic agents development process (Pritchard and Jurima-Romet 2010 ) . Biomarker discovery is closely tied to the other applications of genomics previously described in this chapter. As an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to therapeutic intervention, biomarkers may serve as a substitute for a clinical end point and thus be a surrogate end point (Semizarov 2009b ) . Biomarkers are now available for a wide range of diseases and conditions including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (Maetzler and Berg 2010 ) , cardiac injury (McLean and Huang 2010 ), lung injury (Kodavanti 2010 ) , drug-induced liver injury (Ozer et al. 2010 ) , acute kidney injury (Dieterle and Sistare 2010 ) , immunotoxicity (Dietert 2010 ) , various cancers (Kelloff and Sigman 2012 ) , pediatric care (Goldman et al. 2011 ) , and a host of other diseases and biological conditions.",

The fi eld of metabonomics is the holistic study of the metabolic continuum at the equivalent level to the study of genomics and proteomics. However, unlike genomics and proteomics, microarray technology is little used since the molecules assayed in metabonomics are small molecule end products of gene expression and resulting protein function. The term metabolomics has arisen as the metabolic composition of a cell at a specifi ed time, whereas metabonomics includes both the static metabolite composition and concentrations and the full-time course fl uctuations. Coupling the information being collected in biobanks, large collections of patient's biological samples and medical records, with metabonomic and metabolomic studies, will not only detect why a given metabolite level is increasing or decreasing but may reliably predict the onset of disease. Recent research and discoveries in oncology have led to reconsiderations regarding metabolic dysfunctions in cancer cell proliferation and differentiation. Metabolomic studies may be able to interrogate cancer cells for oxidative stress, a leading cause of genetic instability underpinning carcinogenesis, therefore indicative windows during the life of a cancerous cell for optimal therapeutic intervention (D'Alessandro and Zolla 2012 ). Also, the techniques are fi nding use in drug safety screening, identifi cation of clinical biomarkers, and systems biology studies (see below).",

Effi cacy as determined in clinical trials is based upon a standard dose range derived from the large population studies. Better understanding of the molecular interactions occurring within the pharmacokinetics phase of a drug's action, coupled with new genetics knowledge and then genomic knowledge of the human have advanced us closer to a rational means to optimize drug therapy. Optimization with respect to the patients' genotype, to ensure maximum effi cacy with minimal adverse effects, is the goal. Environment, diet, age, lifestyle, and state of health all can infl uence a person's response to medicines, but understanding an individual's genetic makeup is thought to be the key to creating personalized drugs with greater effi cacy and safety.

The bestcharacterized human polymorphisms are singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring approximately once every 1,000 bases in the three billion base pair human genome (Kassam et al. 2005 ) . The DNA sequence variation is a single nucleotide -A, T, C, or G -in the genome difference between members of a species (or between paired chromosomes in an individual). For example, two sequenced DNA fragments from different individuals, AAGTTC C TA to AAGTTC T TA, contain a difference in a single nucleotide. Commonly referred to as \"snips,\" these subtle sequence variations account for most of the genetic differences observed among humans. Thus, they can be utilized to determine inheritance of genes in successive generations. Technologies available from several companies allow for genotyping hundreds of thousands of SNPs for typically under $1,000 in a couple of days.",

SNPs, when associated with epidemiological and pathological data, can be used to track susceptibilities to common diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes (Davidson and McInerney 2009 ). Biomedical researchers have recognized that discovering SNPs linked to diseases will lead potentially to the identifi cation of new drug targets and diagnostic tests. The identifi cation and mapping of hundreds of thousands of SNPs for use in large-scale association studies may turn the SNPs into biomarkers of disease and/or drug response. Genetic factors such as SNPs are believed to likely infl uence the etiology of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and lipidemias directly and via effects on known risk factors (Davidson and McInerney 2009 ) . For example, in the chronic metabolic disease type 2 diabetes, a strong association with obesity and its pathogenesis includes defects of both secretion and peripheral actions of insulin. The association between type 2 diabetes and SNPs in three genes was detected in addition to a cluster of new variants on chromosome 10q. However, heritability values range only from 30 to 70 % as type 2 diabetes is obviously a heterogeneous disease etiologically and clinically. Thus, SNPs, in the overwhelming majority of cases, will likely not be indicators of disease development by themselves.",

These studies are an examination of the many genetic variations found in different individuals to determine any association between a variant (genotype) and a biological trait (phenotype). The majority of GWAS typically study associations between SNPs and drug response or SNPs and major disease. While the fi rst GWAS was published only in 2005, they have emerged as important tools with, as per data from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog, hundreds of thousands of individuals now tested in over 1,200 human GWAS examining over 200 diseases and traits and 6,229 SNPs as of early 2012 (Hindroff et al. 2012 ) . While believed to be a core driver in the vision for personalized medicine, GWAS when coupled to the HapMap Project (an international effort to identify and map regions of DNA sequence nearly identical within the broad population) to date have been plagued by inconsistencies in genotypes, diffi culties in assigning phenotypes, and overall quality of the data Miclaus et al. 2010 ; Wu et al. 2011a , b , c ) . Challenges have included difficulties identifying the key genetic loci due to two or more genes with small and additive effects on the trait (epistasis), the trait caused by gene mutations at several different chromosomal loci (locus heterogeneity), environmental causes modifying expression of the trait or responsible for the trait, and undetected population structure in the study such as those arising when some study members share a common ancestral heritage (Brazeau and Brazeau 2011b ) .

The hopes and realities of personalized medicine (sometimes referred to as part of \"molecular medicine\"), pharmacotherapy informed by a patient's individual genomic and proteomic information, are global priorities (Knoell and Sadee 2009 ; Grossman and Goldstein 2010 ; Rahbar et al. 2011 ) .

The area looks at the genetic composition or genetic variations of an organism and their connection to drug response. Variations in target pathways are studied to understand how the variations are manifested and how they infl uence response. While overlapping fi elds of study, pharmacogenomics is a much newer term that correlates an individual patient's DNA variation (SNP level of variation knowledge rather than gene level of variation knowledge) with his or her response to pharmacotherapy.

Individualized optimized pharmacotherapy would fi rst require a detailed genetic analysis of a patient, assembling a comprehensive list of SNPs. Pharmacogenomic tests most likely in the form of microarray technology and based upon clinically validated biomarkers would be administered to preidentify responsive patients before dosing with a specifi c agent. Examples of such microarray-based diagnostics are the FDA-approved AmpliChip P450 from Roche to screen a patient for the presence of any of 27 SNPs in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, the Infi niti 2C9 & VKORC1 Multiplex Assay for warfarin therapy from AutoGenomics, and the Pathwork Tissue of Origin test of 15 common malignant tumor types to better focus treatment options.

Emerging fi elds of nutrigenomics and envirogenomics are studying these additional layers of complexity. Personalized medicine will become especially important in cases where the cost of testing is less than either the cost of the drug or the cost of correcting adverse drug reactions caused by the drug. Pharmaceutical care would begin by identifying a patient's susceptibility to a disease, then administering the right drug to the right patient at the right time. For example, the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a personalized breast cancer therapy specifi cally targeted to the HER2 gene product (25-30 % of human breast cancers overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor, HER2 protein) (Kolesar 2009 ). Exhibiting reduced side effects as compared to standard chemotherapy due to this protein target specifi city, trastuzumab is not prescribed to treat a breast cancer patient unless the patient has fi rst tested positive for HER2 overexpression. While currently an immunohistochemical assay, not a sophisticated DNA microarray assay, the example shows the power of such future tests. The success of targeted therapy for personalized medicine has fostered the concept that the era of the blockbuster drug may be over and will be replaced by the \"niche buster\" drug, a highly effective medicine individualized for a small group of responding patients identifi ed by genomic and proteomic techniques. Also, while numerous articles predicted that pharmacogenomics would revolutionize medicine, the initial predictions have not been lived up to the hype due to statistical, scientifi c, and commercial hurdles. With more than 11 million SNP positions believed to be present in the human population, large-scale detection of genetic variation holds the key to successful personalized medicine (Pennisi 2010 ; Reardon 2011 ; Baker 2012 ) . Correlation of environmental factors, behavioral factors, genomic and proteomic factors (including pharmacogenomic and metabolomic factors), and phenotypical observables across large populations remains a daunting data-intensive challenge. Yet, pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are having an impact on modern medicine.",

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for warfarin account for 15 % of all ADRs in the USA, second only to digoxin. Warfarin dose is adjusted with the goal of achieving an INR (International Normalized Ratio = ratio of patient's prothrombin time as compared to that of a normal control) of 2.0-3.0. The clinical challenge is to limit hemorrhage, the primary ADR, while achieving the optimal degree of protection against thromboembolism. Deviation in the INR has been shown to be the strongest risk factor for bleeding complications. The major routes of metabolism of warfarin are by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Some of the compounds, which have been identifi ed to infl uence positively or negatively warfarin's INR, include cimetidine, clofi brate, propranolol, celecoxib (a competitive inhibition of CYP2C9), fl uvoxamine (an inhibitor of several CYP enzymes), various antifungals and antibiotics (e.g., miconazole, fl uconazole, erythromycin), omeprazole, alcohol, ginseng, and garlic. Researchers have determined that the majority of individual patient variation observed clinically in response to warfarin therapy is genetic in nature, infl uenced by the genetic variability of metabolizing enzymes, vitamin K cycle enzymes, and possibly transporter proteins. The CYP2C9 genotype polymorphisms alone explain about 10 % of the variability observed in the warfarin maintenance dose. Figure 8 .5 shows the proteins involved in warfarin action and indicates the pharmacogenomic variants that more signifi cantly infl uence warfarin therapy optimal outcome. Studies at both the basic research and clinical level involve the effect of drug transport proteins on the pharmacokinetic profi le of a drug (Abla and Kroetz 2009 ) . Some areas of active study of the effect of genetic variation on clinical effectiveness include effl ux transporter proteins (for bioavailability, CNS exposure, and tumor resistance) and neurotransmitter uptake transporters (as valid drug targets). Novel transporter proteins are still being identifi ed as a result of the Human Genome Project and subsequent proteomic research. More study is needed on the characterization of expression, regulation, and functional properties of known and new transporter proteins to better assess the potential for prediction of altered drug response based on transporter genotypes.",

Targets include the drug receptor involved in the response as well as the proteins associated with disease risk, pathogenesis, and/or toxicity including infectious disease (Johnson 2009 ; Rogers 2009 ; Webster 2010 ) . There are increasing numbers of prominent examples of inherited polymorphisms infl uencing drug pharmacodynamics. To follow on the warfarin example above (see Fig. 8 .5 ), the majority of individual patient variation observed clinically in response to anticoagulant therapy is genetic in nature.

These drugs are metabolized by the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) to the inactive S-methylated products. Gene mutations (polymorphisms) may occur in as many as 11 % of patients resulting in decreased TPMT-mediated metabolism of the thiopurine drugs. A diagnostic test for TPMT is now available and used clinically. Identifi ed patients with poor TPMT metabolism may need their drug dose lowered 10-15-fold. Mechanisms of multidrug resistance to cancer drugs are infl uenced by genetic differences. A number of polymorphisms in the MDR-1 gene coding for P-glycoprotein, the transmembrane protein drug effl ux pump responsible for multidrug resistance, have been identifi ed. One, known as the T/T genotype and correlated with decreased intestinal expression of P-glycoprotein and increased drug bioavailability, has an allele frequency of 88 % in African-American populations, yet only approxi mately 50 % in Caucasian-American populations (Kolesar 2009 ).",

The pace of advancement has been slower than promised (Zuckerman and Milne 2012 ). There are also economic, societal, and ethical issues that must be addressed to successfully implement genetic testingbased individualized pharmacotherapy (Huston 2010 ) . It is fair to state that most drugs will not be effective in all patients all of the time. Thus, the pressure of payers to move from a \"payment for product\" to a \"payment for clinically signifi cant health outcomes\" model is reasonable. The use of omic health technologies and health informatics approaches to stratify patient populations for drug effectiveness and drug safety is a laudable goal. However, the technologies are currently quite expensive and the resulting drug response predictability is now just being validated clinically. Costeffectiveness and cost-benefi t analyses are limited at this date (Chalkidou and Rawlins 2011 ) . Also, the resulting environment created by these technologies in the context of outcomes expectations and new drug access/reimbursement models will give rise to a new pharmaceutical business paradigm that is still evolving and not well understood.",

Omic technologies were not generally involved in the development and approval process. Based on the analysis of health statistics suggesting that the rate of mortality in blacks with heart disease is twice as high in whites in the 45-64 age group, a clinical trial of this older drug combination in 1,050 African-Americans was conducted and the 43 % improvement in survival in the treatment arm resulted in FDA approval of the drug exclusively in African-Americans. Yet, modern anthropology and genetics have shown that while race does exist as a real social construct, there are no genetically distinguishable human racial groups (Ossorio 2004 ). Thus, attributing observed differences in biomedical outcomes and phenotypical observations to genetic differences among races is problematic and ethically challenging. Race is likely just a surrogate marker for the environmental and genetic causes of disease and response to pharmacotherapy. Now, factor in the introduction of omic technologies broadly into healthcare in a manner to segregate patient populations based on genomic and proteomic characteristics. It is obvious that these modern technologies pose provocative consequences for public policy (including data protection, insurability, and access to care), and these challenges must be addressed by decision makers, scientists, healthcare providers, and the public for personalized medicine to be successful (for further insight into this complex area, please read Brazeau and Brazeau 2011c ).",

Modern genomics, GWAS and SNP analyses, confi rm this and identify genetic variants that may be associated with a different phenotype. However, genome-level information alone does not generally predict phenotype at an individual level (Daxinger and Whitelaw 2012 ). For instance, researchers and clinicians have known for some time that an individual's response to a drug is affected by their genetic makeup (DNA sequence, genotype) and a set of disease and environmental characteristics working alone or in concert to determine that response. Research in animal models has suggested that in addition to DNA sequence, there are a number of other \"levels\" of information that infl uence transcription of genomic information. As you are aware, every person's body contains trillions of cells, all of which have essentially the same genome and, therefore, the same genes. Yet some cells are optimized for development into one or more of the 200+ specialized cells that make up our bodies: muscles, bones, brain, etc. For this to transpire from within the same genome, some genes must be turned on or off at different points of cell development in different cell types to affect gene expression, protein production, and cell differentiation, growth, and function. There is a rapidly evolving fi eld of research known as epigenetics (or epigenomics) that can be viewed as a conduit between genotype and phenotype. Epigenetics literally means \"above genetics or over the genetic sequence.\" It is the factor or factors that infl uence cell behavior by means other than via a direct effect on the genetic machinery. Epigenetic regulation includes DNA methylation and covalent histone modifi cations (Fig. 8.6 ) and is mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene expression that result without a change in DNA sequence (Berger et al. 2009 ). Epigenomics is the merged science of genomics and epigenetics (Raghavachari 2012 ) . Functionally, epigenetics acts to regulate gene expression, gene silencing during genomic imprinting, apoptosis, X-chromosome inactivation, and tissue-specifi c gene activation (such as maintenance of stem cell pluripotency) (Garske and Denu 2009 ).",

Packaging of DNA into chromatin can render large regions of the DNA inaccessible and prevent processes such as DNA transcription from occurring. Epigenetic regulation of histone proteins can be by chemical modifi cation including acetylation, methylation, sumoylation and ubiquitylation (Herceg and Murr 2011 ) . Each can cause structural changes in chromatin affecting DNA accessibility. Non-protein-coding RNAs, known as ncRNAs, have also been shown to contribute to epigenetic regulation as have mRNAs which can be processed and participate in various interference pathways (Collins and Schonfeld 2011 ) .",

In the postgenomic era, the intricacies of protein glycosylation, the mechanisms of genetic control, and the internal and external factors infl uencing the extent and patterns of glycosylation are important to understanding protein function and proteomics.

The majority of protein-based medicinal agents contain some form of posttranslational modification that can profoundly affect the biological activity of that protein. Bacterial hosts for recombinant DNA could produce the animal proteins with identical or nearly identical amino acid sequences. However, early work in bacteria lacked the ability to attach sugar moieties to proteins (a process called glycosylation). New methodologies may help overcome this issue (cf. Chap. 3 ). Many of the non-glycosylated proteins differ in their biological activity as compared to the native glycoprotein. The production of animal proteins that lacked glycosylation provided an unexpected opportunity to study the functional role of sugar molecules on glycoproteins.

Simple carbohydrates can be attached to other types of biological molecules to form glycoconjugates including glycoproteins (predominantly protein), glycolipids and proteoglycans (about 95 % polysaccharide and 5 % protein). While carbohydrate chemistry and biology have been active areas of research for centuries, advances in biotechnology have provided techniques and added energy to the study of glycans. Oligosaccharides found conjugated to proteins (glycoproteins) and lipids (glycolipids) display a tremendous structural diversity. The linkages of the monomeric units in proteins and in nucleic acids are generally consistent in all such molecules. Glycans, however, exhibit far greater variability in the linkage between monomeric units than that found in the other biopolymers. As an example, Fig. 8 .7 illustrates the common linkage sites to create polymers of glucose. Glucose can be linked at four positions: C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 and also can take one of two possible anomeric confi gurations at C-2 (\u03b1 and \u03b2). The effect of multiple linkage arrangements is seen in the estimate of (Kobata 1996 ) . He has estimated that for a 10-mer (oligomer of length 10), the number of structurally distinct linear oligomers for each of the biopolymers is DNA (with 4 possible bases), 1.04 \u00d7 10 6 ; protein (with 20 possible amino acids), 1.28 \u00d7 10 13 ; and oligosaccharide (with eight monosaccharide types), 1.34 \u00d7 10 18 .",

Many of the therapeutically used recombinant DNA-produced proteins are glycosylated including erythropoietin, glucocerebrosidase, and tissue plasminogen activator. Without the appropriate carbohydrates attached, none of these proteins will function therapeutically as does the parent glycoprotein. Glycoforms (variations of the glycosylation pattern of a glycoprotein) of the same protein may differ in physicochemical and biochemical properties. For example, erythropoietin has one O-linked and three N-linked glycosylation sites. The removal of the terminal sugars at each site destroys in vivo activity and removing all sugars results in a more rapid clearance of the molecule and a shorter circulatory half-life (Takeuchi et al. 1990 ). Yet, the opposite effect is observed for the deglycosylation of the hematopoietic cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Cebon et al. 1990 ). In that case, removing the carbohydrate residues increases the specifi c activity sixfold. The sugars of glycoproteins are known to play a role in the recognition and binding of biomolecules to other molecules in disease states such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, HIV infection, the fl u, and other infectious diseases.",

The metabolome would include the major classes of biological molecules: proteins (and amino acids), nucleic acids, and carbohydrates. The \"lipidome\" would be a subset of the metabolome that describes the complete lipid profi le within a cell, tissue, or whole organism. In lipidomic research, a vast amount of information (structures, functions, interactions, and dynamics) quantitatively describing alterations in the content and composition of different lipid molecular species is accrued after perturbation of a cell, tissue, or organism through changes in its physiological or pathological state. The study of lipidomics is important to a better understanding of many metabolic diseases, as lipids are believed to play a role in obesity, atherosclerosis, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes.",

Biology has become an information science defi ning all the elements in a complex biological system and placing them in a database for comparative interpretation. As seen in Fig. 8 .2 , the hierarchy of information collection goes well beyond the biodata contained in the genetic code that is transcribed and translated. Systems biology involves a generally complex interactive system. This research area is often described as a noncompetitive or precompetitive technology by the pharmaceutical industry because it is believed to be a foundational technology that must be better developed to be successful at the competitive technology of drug discovery and development. It is the study of the interactions between the components of a biological system and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system. Systems biology is essential for our understanding of how all the individual parts of intricate biological networks are organized and function in living cells. The biological system may involve enzymes and metabolites in a metabolic pathway or other interacting biological molecules affecting a biological process. Molecular biologists have spent the past 50+ years teasing apart cellular pathways down to the molecular level. Characterized by a cycle of theory, computational modeling, and experiment to quantitatively describe cells or cell processes, systems biology is a dataintensive endeavor that results in a conceptual framework for the analysis and understanding of complex biological systems in varying contexts (Rothberg et al. 2005 ; Klipp et al. 2005 ; Meyer et al. 2011 ) . Statistical mining, data alignment, probabilistic and mathematical modeling, and data visualization into networks are among the mathematical models employed to integrate the data and assemble the systems network (Gehlenborg et al. 2010 ) . New measurements are stored with existing data, including extensive functional annotations, in molecular databases, and model assembly provides libraries of network models (Schrattenholz et al. 2010 ) .",

Later, the term was extended to also include animals in which their endogenous genomic DNA has had its molecular structure manipulated. While there are some similarities between transgenic technology and gene therapy, it is important to distinguish clearly between them. Technically speaking, the introduction of foreign DNA sequences into a living cell is called gene transfer. Thus, one method to create a transgenic animal involves gene transfer (transgene incorporated into the genome). Gene therapy (cf. Chap. 24 ) is also a gene transfer procedure and, in a sense, produces a transgenic human. In transgenic animals, however, the foreign gene is transferred indiscriminately into all cells, including germ line cells. The process of gene therapy differs generally from transgenesis since it involves a transfer of the desired gene in such a way that involves only specifi c somatic and hematopoietic cells, and not germ cells. Thus unlike in gene therapy, the genetic changes in transgenic organisms are conserved in any offspring according to the general rules of Mendelian inheritance.",

The transgene contains both the DNA encoding the desired target amino acid sequence along with regulatory sequences that will mediate the expression of the added gene. The microinjected eggs are then implanted into the reproductive tract of a female and allowed to develop into embryos. The foreign DNA generally becomes randomly inserted at a single site on just one of the host chromosomes (i.e., the founder transgenic animal is heterozygous). Thus, each transgenic founder animal (positive transgene incorporated animals) is a unique species. Interbreeding of founder transgenic animals where the transgene has been incorporated into germ cells may result in the birth of a homozygous progeny provided the transgene incorporation did not induce a mutation of an essential endogenous gene. All cells of the transgenic animal will contain the transgene if DNA insertion occurs prior to the fi rst cell division. However, usually only 20-25 % of the offspring contain detectable levels of the transgene. Selection of neonatal animals possessing an incorporated transgene can readily be accomplished either by the direct identifi cation of specifi c DNA or mRNA sequences or by the observation of gross phenotypic characteristics.",

The non-replicating viral vector binds to the embryonic host cells, allowing subsequent transfer and insertion of the transgene into the host genome. Many of the experimental human gene therapy trials employ the same viral vectors. Advantages of this method of transgene production are the ease with which genes can be introduced into embryos at various stages of development, and the characteristic that only a single copy of the transgene is usually integrated into the genome. Disadvantages include possible genetic recombination of the viral vector with other viruses present, the size limitation of the introduced DNA (up to 7 kb of DNA, less than the size of some genes), and the diffi culty in preparing certain viral vectors.",

ES cells, a cultured cell line derived from the inner cell mass (blastocyst) of a blastocyte (early preimplantation embryo), are capable of having their genomic DNA modifi ed while retaining their ability to contribute to both somatic and germ cell lineages. The desired gene is incorporated into ES cells by one of several methods such as microinjection. This is followed by introduction of the genetically modifi ed ES cells into the blastocyst of an early preimplantation embryo, selection, and culturing of targeted ES cells which are transferred subsequently to the reproductive tract of the surrogate host animal. The resulting progeny is screened for evidence that the desired genetic modifi cation is present and selected appropriately. In mice, the process results in approximately 30 % of the progeny containing tissue genetically derived from the incorporated ES cells. Interbreeding of selected founder animals can produce species homozygous for the mutation.",

            "text": "The science of cloning and the resulting ethical debate surrounding it is well beyond the scope of this chapter. Yet it is important to place the concept of animal cloning within the pharmaceutically important context of transgenic animal production. The technique of microinjection (and its variations) has formed the basis for commercial transgenic animal production. While successful, the microinjection process is limited to the creation of only a small number of transgenic animals in a given birth. The slow process of conventional breeding of the resulting transgenic progeny must follow to produce a larger number of transgenic animals with the same transgene as the original organism. To generate a herd (or a fl ock, etc.), an alternative approach would be advantageous. The technique of nuclear transfer, the replacement of the nuclear genomic DNA of an oocyte (immature egg) or a single-cell fertilized embryo with that from a donor cell, is such an alternative breeding methodology. Animal \"cloning\" can result from this nuclear transfer technology. Judged the journal Science's most important breakthrough of 1997 creating the sheep Dolly, the fi rst cloned mammal, from a single cell of a 6-year old ewe was a feat many had thought impossible. Dolly was born after nuclear transfer of the genome from an adult mammary gland cell (Khan 2012a ) . Since this announcement, commercial and exploratory development of nuclear transfer technology has progressed rapidly with various species cloned. It is important to note that the cloned sheep Dolly was NOT a transgenic animal. While Dolly was a clone of an adult ewe, she did not possess a transgene. However, cloning could be used to breed clones of transgenic animals or to directly produce transgenic animals (if prior to nuclear transfer, a transgene was inserted into the genome of the cloning donor). For example, human factor IX (a blood factor protein) transgenic sheep was generated by nuclear transfer from transfected fetal fi broblasts (Schniecke et al. 1997 ) . Several of the resulting progeny were shown to be transgenic (i.e., possessing the human factor IX gene), and one was named Polly. Thus, animal cloning can be utilized not only for breeding but also for the production of potential human therapeutic proteins and other useful pharmaceutical products (Shultz et al. 2007 ).",

Agricultural enhancements have resulted by engineering plants to be more herbicide tolerant, insect resistant, fungus resistant, virus resistant, and stress tolerant (Baez 2005 ) . Of importance for human health and pharmaceutical biotechnology, gene transfer technology is routinely used to manipulate bulk human protein production in a wide variety of transgenic plant species. It is signifi cant to note that transgenic plants are attractive bulk bioreactors because their posttranslational modification processes often result in plant-derived recombinant human proteins with greater glycosylation pattern similarity to that found in the corresponding native human proteins than would be observed in a corresponding mammalian production system. The transgenic seeds would result in seedlings capable of expressing the human protein. Transplantation to the fi eld followed by normal growth, harvest of the biomass, and downstream isolation and protein purifi cation results in a valuable alternative crop for farming. Tobacco fi elds producing pharmaceutical grade human antibodies (sometimes referred to as \"plantibodies\") and edible vaccines contained in transgenic potatoes and tomatoes are not futuristic visions, but current research projects in academic and corporate laboratories. Farmers' fi elds are not the sole sites for human protein production from fl ora.

During such large animal \"gene farming,\" the transgenic animals serve as bioreactors to synthesize recoverable quantities of therapeutically useful proteins. Among the advantages of expressing protein in animal milk is that the protein is generally produced in sizable quantities and can be harvested manually or mechanically by simply milking the animal.

Primate-to-human transplantation (xenotransplantation) was successful, but ethical issues and limited number of donor animals were signifi cant barriers. Transplant surgeons recognized early on that organs from the pig were a rational choice for xenotransplantation (due to physiological, anatomical, ethical, and supply reasons) if the serious hyperacute rejection could be overcome. Several research groups in academia and industry have pioneered the transgenic engineering of pigs expressing both human complement inhibitory proteins and key human blood group proteins (antigens) (McCurry et al. 1995 ; Dunn et al. 2005 ; Van Eyck et al. 2010 ) . Cloning has now produced transgenic pigs for xenotransplantation. Cells, tissues, and organs from these double transgenic animals appear to be very resistant to the humoral immune system-mediated reactions of both primates and likely humans. These fi ndings begin to pave the way for potential xenograft transplantation of animal components into humans with a lessened chance of acute rejection.

Mice are the laboratory animal species most closely related to humans in which the knockout technique can be easily performed, so they are a favorite subject for knockout experiments. While a mouse carrying an introduced transgene is called a transgenic mouse, transgenic technologies can also produce a knockout animal. A knockout mouse, also called a gene knockout mouse or a gene-targeted knockout mouse, is an animal in which an endogenous gene (genomic wild-type allele) has been specifi cally inactivated by replacing it with a null allele (Sharpless and DePinho 2006 ; Wu et al. 2011b ; Clark and Pazdernik 2012b ) . A null allele is a nonfunctional allele of a gene generated by either deletion of the entire gene or mutation of the gene resulting in the synthesis of an inactive protein. Recent advances in intranuclear gene targeting and embryonic stem cell technologies as described above are expanding the capabilities to produce knockout mice routinely for studying certain human genetic diseases or elucidating the function of a specifi c gene product.",

Incorporation is generally quite low; approximately one cell in a million has the required gene replacement. However, the process is designed to impart neomycin and ganciclovir resistance only to those ES cells in which homologous gene integration has resulted. This facilitates the selection and propagation of the correctly engineered ES cells. The resulting ES cells are then injected into early mouse embryos creating chimeric mice (heterozygous for the knockout allele) containing tissues derived from both host cells and ES cells. The chimeric mice are mated to confi rm that the null allele is incorporated into the germ line. The confi rmed heterozygous chimeric mice are bred to homogeneity producing progeny that are homozygous knockout mice. Worldwide, three major mouse knockout programs are proceeding in collaboration to create a mutation in each of the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes in the mouse genome using a combination of gene trapping and gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Staff 2007 ) . These include (1) The continuing discoveries of the three worldwide mouse knockout consortia and independent research laboratories around the world will further create better models of human monogenic and polygenic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, knockout mice have been engineered that have extremely elevated cholesterol levels while being maintained on normal chow diets due to their inability to produce apolipoprotein E (apoprotein E). Apoprotein E is the major lipoprotein component of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) responsible for liver clearance of VLDL. These engineered mice are being examined as animal models of atherosclerosis useful in cardiovascular drug discovery and development.

In addition, high-throughput DNA sequencing efforts, positional cloning programs, and novel embryonic stem cell-based gene discovery research areas all exploit the knockout mouse as their laboratory. Engineered animal models are proving invaluable to pharmaceutical research since small animal models of disease may be created and validated to mimic a disease in human patients. Mouse, rat, and zebra fi sh are the most common models explored and used. Genetic engineering can predispose an animal to a particular disease under scrutiny, and the insertion of human genes into the animal can initiate the development of a more clinically relevant disease condition. In human clinical studies, assessments of effi cacy and safety often rely on measured effects for surrogate biomarkers and adverse event reporting. Validated transgenic animal models of human disease allow for parallel study and possible predictability prior to entering clinical trials. Also, it is possible to screen potential drug candidates in vivo against a human receptor target inserted into an animal model. The number of examples of transgenic animal models of human disease useful in drug discovery and development efforts is growing rapidly (Sharpless and DePinho 2006 ; Schultz et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2011b ; Clark and Pazdernik 2012b ) .

For example, as described above systems biology examines complex biological systems as interacting and integrated complex networks. The new and developing fi eld of study known as synthetic biology explores how to build artifi cial complex biological systems employing many of the same tools and experimental techniques favored by system biologists. Synthetic biology looks at both the strategic redesign and/or the fabrication of existing biological systems and the design and construction of biological components and systems that do not already exist in nature (Khalil and Collins 2010 ) . Synthetic genomics is a subset of synthetic biology that focuses on the redesign and fabrication of new genetic material constructed from raw chemicals. The focus of synthetic biology is often on ways of taking parts of natural biological systems, characterizing and simplifying them, and using them as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system. Synthetic biology studies may provide a more detailed understanding of complex biological systems down to the molecular level. Being able to design and construct a complex system is also one very practical approach to understanding that system under various conditions. The levels a synthetic biologist may work at include the organism, tissue and organ, intercellular, intracellular, biological pathway, and down to the molecular level. There are many exciting applications for synthetic biology that have been explored or hypothesized across various fi elds of scientifi c study including designed and optimized biological pathways, natural product manufacturing, new drug molecule synthesis, and biosensing (Ruder et al. 2011) . From an engineering perspective, synthetic biology could lead to the design and building of engineered biological systems that process information, modify existing chemicals, fabricate new molecules and materials, and maintain and enhance human health and our environment. Because of the obvious societal concerns that synthetic biology experiments raise, the broader science community has engaged in considerable efforts at developing guidelines and regulations and addressing the issues of intellectual property and governance and the ethical, societal, and legal implications. Several bioethics research institutes published reports on ethical concerns and the public perception of synthetic biology. A report from the United States Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues called for enhanced federal oversight on this emerging technology.",

True combinatorial chemistry or sometimes referred to as combichem, applies methods to substantially reduce the number of synthetic operations or steps needed to synthesize large numbers of compounds. Combichem is conducted on solid supports (resins) to facilitate the manipulations required to reduce labor during purification of multiple products in the same vessel. Differing from combinatorial chemistry, multiple parallel synthesis procedures apply automation to the synthetic process to address the many separate reaction vessels needed, but the number of operations needed to carry out a synthesis is practically the same as the conventional approach. Thus, the potential productivity of multiple parallel methods is not as high as combinatorial chemistries. Parallel chemistries can be conducted on solid-phase supports or in solution to facilitate purifi cation. Figure 8 .12 provides an illustration of a combinatorial mix-and-match process in which a simple building block (a starting material such as an amino acid, peptide, heterocycle, other small molecule, etc.) is joined to one or more other simple building blocks in every possible combination. Assigning the task to automated synthesizing equipment results in the rapid creation of large collections or libraries (as large as 10,000 compounds) of diverse molecules. Ingenious methods have been devised to direct the molecules to be synthesized, to identify the structure of the products, to purify the products via automation, and to isolate compounds. When coupled with high-throughput screening, thousands of compounds can be generated, screened, and evaluated for further development in a matter of weeks.",

What are two approaches to high-throughput synthesis of drug leads and how do they differ? \u25a0 Answers 1. HGP structural genomics was envisioned to proceed through increasing levels of genetic resolution: detailed human genetic linkage maps [approx. 2 megabase pairs (Mb = million base pairs) resolution], complete physical maps (0.1 Mb resolution), and ultimately complete DNA sequencing of the approximately 3.5 billion base pairs (23 pairs of chromosomes) in a human cell nucleus [1 base pair (bp) resolution]. 2. Functional genomics is a new approach to genetic analysis that focuses on genome-wide patterns of gene expression, the mechanisms by which gene expression is coordinated, and the interrelationships of gene expression when a cellular environmental change occurs. 3. A new research area called proteomics seeks to defi ne the function and correlate that with expression profi les of all proteins encoded within a genome. 4. While comparing the base sequences in the DNA of two individuals reveals them to be approximately 99.9 % identical, base differences, or polymorphisms, are scattered throughout the genome. The best-characterized human polymorphisms are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring approximately once every 1,000 bases in the 3.5 billion base pair human genome. 5. Pharmacogenetics is the study of how an individual's genetic differences infl uence drug action, usage, and dosing. A detailed knowledge of a patient's pharmacogenetics in relation to a particular drug therapy may lead to enhanced effi cacy and greater safety. While sometimes used interchangeably (especially in pharmacy practice literature), pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are subtly different. Pharmacogenomics introduces the additional element of our present technical ability to pinpoint patient-specifi c DNA variation using genomic techniques. While overlapping fi elds of study, pharmacogenomics is a much newer term that correlates an individual patient's DNA variation (SNP level of variation knowledge rather than gene level of variation knowledge) with his or her response to pharmacotherapy.",

The biochips known as DNA microarrays and oligonucleotide microarrays are a surface collection of hundreds to thousands of immobilized DNA sequences or oligonucleotides in a grid created with specialized equipment that can be simultaneously examined to conduct expression analysis. 8. Genomic variation affects not only the pharmacokinetic profi le of drugs (via drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporter proteins), it also strongly infl uences the pharmacodynamic profi le of drugs via the drug target. 9. Pharmacotherapy informed by a patient's individual genomic and proteomic information. Sometimes referred to as giving the right drug to the right patient in the right dose at the right time. 10. Biomarkers are clinically relevant substances used as indicators of a biologic state. Detection or concentration change of a biomarker may indicate a particular disease state physiology or toxicity. A change in expression or state of a protein biomarker may correlate with the risk or progression of a disease, with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment or the drug's safety profi le. 11. Systems biology is the study of the interactions between the components of a biological system, and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system. 12. Engineered animal models are proving invaluable since small animal models of disease are often poor mimics of that disease in human patients. Genetic engineering can predispose an animal to a particular disease under scrutiny, and the insertion of human genes into the animal can initiate the development of a more clinically relevant disease condition. 13. (a) DNA microinjection and random gene addition and (b) homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. 14. A knockout mouse, also called a gene knockout mouse or a gene-targeted knockout mouse, is an animal in which an endogenous gene (genomic wild-type allele) has been specifi cally inactivated by replacing it with a null allele. 15. There are two overall approaches to highthroughput synthesis. True combinatorial chemistry applies methods to substantially reduce the number of synthetic operations or steps needed to synthesize large numbers of compounds. Combichem, as it is sometimes referred to, is conducted on solid supports (resins) to facilitate the needed manipulations that reduce labor. Differing from combinatorial chemistry, parallel procedures apply automation to the synthetic process, but the number of operations needed to carry out a synthesis is practically the same as the conventional approach. Thus, the potential productivity of parallel methods is not as high as combinatorial chemistries. Parallel chemistries can be conducted on solid-phase supports or in solution.
