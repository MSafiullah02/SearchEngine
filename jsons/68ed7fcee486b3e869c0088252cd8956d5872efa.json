Interaction of a single dose (36 mg/kg body wt) of the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin with mouse peritoneal macrophages was examined in C57Bl/6, (C57Bl/6 x A/J)F,, and A/J strains of different genetic resistance to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection. In vivo studies showed increased susceptibility to MHV3 acute disease of C57Bl/6 and (C57B1/6 X A/J)F, animals challenged with the pesticide. Significant decrease of mean time of death in dieldrin-exposed, MHV3-infected susceptible C57Bl/6 mice was observed similarly upon po or ip administration of a single, sublethal dose of dieldrin. In addition, decrease of humoral response to the virus was quantified by determination of anti-MHV3 IgG antibodies in spleen cell supematant fractions and in blood sera of dieldrin-exposed C57Bl/6 mice. A single dose of dieldrin did not alter the in vivo resistance of A/J animals to acute MHV3 disease. The resistant A/J mice, however, showed increased mortality upon two subsequent exposures to dieldtin followed by infection with high lethal doses of MHV3. Phagocytic activity, cell adherence capacity, and attachment and uptake of 3H-radiolabeled MHV3 by C57Bl/6 peritoneal macrophages were determined by in vitro studies. These affector activities of peritoneal macrophages were slightly decreased or unchanged in cells originating from animals exposed to the pesticide. However, the intrinsic activity of MHV3 restriction appeared to be affected in macrophages derived from dieldrin-treated animals: (i) peritoneal C57Bl/6 macrophages collected from the early phase of acute MHV3 disease contained increased MHV3 antigen and (ii) increased cytolysis was observed after in vitro MHV3 infection of macrophages originating from dieldrin-exposed C57Bl/6 mice. o 1985 Academic PRSS, IX.

Since Bang and Warwick ( 1960) reported that the macrophage is a target cell for MHV and since destruction of macrophages with silica was shown to affect host defense mechanisms against MHV infection (Tamura et al., 1979) it is of interest to see the effects of xenobiotics on MHV-macrophage interactions.

Exposure of C57B1/6 mice to a single ip dose of dieldrin, 4 days prior to virus infection, resulted in more rapid virus spread in peritoneal macrophages and more rapid death of animals (Table 1) . Some deaths occurred only 48 hr postinfection in the dieldrin-treated group and virus replication was relatively high as shown by quantification of MHV3 antigens and virus titer in cultures of peritoneal macrophages (Table 1) . No deaths occurred 48 hr postinfection in vehicle-treated animals and untreated controls, and less than 15% death occurred in these animals 72 hr postinfection, whereas over 90% of dieldrinexposed animals were dead at that time (Table 1 ). The mean day of death (MDD) for the vehicle group was significantly higher than that for the dieldrin group (4.13 + 0.74 compared to 2.93 & 0.45, respectively), which was found by the Student t test (p < 0.001) and by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.02). No significant differences in MDD between MHV3-infected untreated controls and controls treated with corn oil (ip or po, Table 2 ) were found by the Mann-Whitney U test. However, po administration of 18 or 30 mg/kg body wt of dieldrin resulted in a significant decrease in the MDD between vehicle-treated animals and dieldrinexposed animals, subsequently infected with the virus (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005, respectively, by the Student t test and p < 0.02 by the Mann-Whitney U test). This effect of dieldrin was observed clearly upon infection of susceptible C57B1/6 and semisusceptible (C57B1/6 X A/J)FI mice with a relatively low dose of a less pathogenic, L-cloned substrain of MHV3 (Fig. 1) . All C57B1/6 mice (15 animals per group) died after infection with L-MHV3, and significant differences in MDD between vehicle-treated and dieldrin-treated mice were found (9.7 + 2.6 compared to 5.4 + 1.1, respectively, p < 0.00 1 by the Student t test and p < 0.02 by the Mann-Whitney U test). Mortality in semisusceptible (C57Bl/ 6 X A/J)F, mice (25 animals per group) reached 26% within 3 weeks after infection, and no death occurred during that time in vehicle-treated controls infected with the same, low dose of virus (Fig. 1 ). It appears from these data that exposure to dieldrin shortened the survival time in acute MHV3 disease of the susceptible C57B1/6 strain and increased susceptibility to the acute disease in the semisusceptible (C57B1/6 X A/J)F, strain.",

Figure 4A shows increased MHV3-induced cell lysis, observed 24 and 48 hr after in vitro infection of C57Bl/ 6 peritoneal macrophages derived from dieldrin-exposed animals. No increase of MHV3 titer, however, was found in macrophage cultures, suggesting therefore that virus replication itself was not augmented by the pesticide (Fig. 4B) . Paradoxically, decreased virus titer, at higher infectious doses, was observed in culture supematant fractions of dieldrin-exposed macrophages (Fig. 4B ). This decrease might be explained by more rapid cell lysis and earlier terminating of virus production in dieldrin-exposed macrophage cultures, where apparently no cells were left after multicycle virus replication (24 to 48 hr) as compared to oil-treated controls (Fig.  4 ). In addition, in vitro treatment of C57Bl/ 6 peritoneal macrophages with 0 to 10 pg/ ml dieldrin showed the pesticide-dose dependent increase of MHV3-induced cytopathic effects and decrease of the virus titer at concentrations of the pesticide > 1 &ml (Fig. 5) . Uptake of 3H-MHV3 into C57B1/6 peritoneal macrophages treated for 48 hr in vitro with dieldrin at a concentration > 1 pg/ ml was significantly decreased (Fig. 5A) , and virus replication appeared to be slightly inhibited at different infectious doses (0.00 1 to 0.1 moi) (Fig. 5B) . These results suggest that at low in vitro doses of dieldrin (less than 1 pg/ml) there was little effect of the pesticide on virus growth and/or virus-induced cytopathic effects, and that at higher doses of dieldrin there was increased susceptibility of the macrophages to MHV3-induced cytolysis. This probably secondarily accounts for the reduced plaque-forming units observed.",

Resistance to MHV3-induced cytopathic effects is an intrinsic factor, possibly genetically controlled (Dupuy et al., 1980; Arnheiter et al., 1982) . Induction of viral cytopathic effects may be related to modifications of lysosomal membranes (Allison, 1967) or to a depletion of surface membrane resources following emergence of enveloped virus without compensatory membrane production (Quigley et al., 1972) . Because organochlorine pesticides interact primarily with cell membranes (Omann and Lakowicz, 1982; Desaiah, 198 1; Antunes-Madeira and Madeira, 1979) we can assume that the dieldrin-exposed macrophages were more susceptible to MHV3-induced cytopathic effects due to membrane modifications by the pesticide. The nature of the interaction of dieldrin with MHV3-induced cytolysis, however, requires further studies. Dieldrin is a potent toxic agent, affecting the population of peritoneal macrophages (Loose et al., 198 1; Kaminski et al., 1982) , i.e., decreasing cell viability and decreasing phagocytic activities of cells.",

Our studies similarly revealed slight or no alteration of the affector macrophage activities by dieldrin in C57B1/6 mice. Further studies, however, are necessary to establish the effects of dieldrin on macrophage effector activity in MHV3 infection. We cannot exclude the interaction of dieldrin with cellular host defense mechanisms other than macrophages and affecting in vivo macrophage-lymphocyte cooperation in MHV3 acute disease (Dupuy et al., 1980; Siddel et al., 198 1) . Our preliminary studies showed the pesticide effects on other cells involved in MHV3 restriction; for instance, the viral abrogation of lymphoproliferative activity of T cells was markedly aggravated by the exposure of C57B1/6 animals to dieldrin .",

This susceptibility is controlled by at least two major genes, or gene complex, e.g., one for the acute disease and the other, H-2 linked, for the chronic disease (Levy-Leblond et al., 1979) . However, we cannot exclude the strain-specific differences in dieldrin toxicity and pharmacokinetics of dieldrin between C57B1/6 and A/J strains. Such differences have been shown for other mouse strains and other xenobiotics, like TCDD, which induce toxicity through an Ah locus-dependent mechanism in mice (Poland and Glover, 1980; Nagarkatti et al., 1984) .",
