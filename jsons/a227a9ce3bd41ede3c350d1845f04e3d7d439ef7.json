            "text": "One of the major issues in theoretical modeling of epidemic spreading is the development of methods to control the transmission of an infectious agent. Human behavior plays a fundamental role in the spreading dynamics and can be used to stop a disease from spreading or to reduce its burden, as individuals aware of the presence of a disease can take measures to reduce their exposure to contagion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the spread of diseases with awareness in complex networks. Unlike previous models, the information is propagated following a generalized Maki-Thompson rumor model. Flexibility on the timescale between information and disease spreading is also included. We verify that the velocity characterizing the diffusion of information awareness greatly influences the disease prevalence. We also show that a reduction in the fraction of unaware individuals does not always imply a decrease of the prevalence, as the relative timescale between disease and awareness spreading plays a crucial role in the systems' dynamics. This result is shown to be independent of the network topology. We finally calculate the epidemic threshold of our model, and show that it does not depend on the relative timescale. Our results provide a new view on how information influence disease spreading and can be used for the development of more efficient methods for disease control.",

These methods include the optimization of more traditional strategies to control an outbreak, such as vaccination [3, 4] or or a quarantine mechanism based on adaptive connections [5, 6] , but also novel approaches that take into account more accurately human behavioral responses.",

However, awareness by spreading phenomenon models the word-ofmouth propagation of an information about the epidemics. Funk and others [20] showed that, for an SIR epidemics, the spreading of awareness through individual contacts could avoid an epidemic outbreak, whereas a global awareness could only reduce the outbreak size, but not stop it.

This is a limitation, as many real-world phenomena do not occur at the same rates. For instance, the HIV infection and renewing cycle has a typical timescale of many years, whereas the information and awareness about HIV can be spread and forgotten several times during this period. Moreover, important discoveries were obtained by flexibilizing relative timescales between simultaneous processes. For example, Oliveira and Dickman [31] determined that the competition between two biological species may be won by that with a slower birth/death rate under certain environmental circumstances. G\u00f3mez and collaborators [32] showed that the diffusion on a two-layer network can be possibly faster than on each individual layer, if the diffusion timescales inside and between the layers are different. It may, therefore, be of great value to consider that epidemic spreading and the propagating awareness about it occur at different timescales.",

A stifler is an informed node who does not propagate the information anymore.

If the contacted neighbor, however, is an aware or stifler node, then the node that makes the contact becomes stifler. A stifler individual can also forget the information about the disease transmission, becoming ignorant about the disease transmission again. We again use a discrete time approach [47] by considering a reactive formulation in which, at each time step t = 1, each aware (A) node first tries to inform each of its unaware (U) neighbors with probability \u03b3 , and then becomes a stifler (R) with probability \u03c3 .

Using these overall states, we define the interaction between the epidemics and awareness by adding two new features. First, a susceptible node that is informed (aware or stifler) will reduce its contagion probability by a factor (with 0 < 1) for each contact, meaning that it will get the disease from each of its infected neighbors with probability \u03b2 (less than \u03b2). Such a feature represents the adoption of prevention methods against the disease. Second, an additional transition called self-awareness is considered: If not informed by a neighbor, then an infected-unaware (IU) node can, during the same time step, become aware with probability \u03ba, by knowing its own condition. This process simulates the case in which an infected subject recognizes the symptoms of the disease and becomes aware of the infection.",

That is, a node who knows about its own infection does not inform other nodes and also impair the transmission of other nodes, creating additional stiflers around it. This behavior is approximately observed in the case of HIV transmission, in which some infected individuals knows about its own infection but do not voluntarily notify their sexual partners [45] , acting as infected-stiflers. We include this feature by reducing the probability that an infected-stifler node forgets the information by a factor of (1 \u2212 \u03ba ) (so that the self-awareness parameter also reduces the rate at which infected-stiflers become infected-unaware).

Figure 4 shows the same plot as in Fig. 3 for the modified model, also with Monte Carlo and Markov chain simulations. For \u03c0 = 0.1, as it happens in the baseline model, both densities of aware and stifler nodes increase with \u03ba. However, for \u03c0 = 0.9, when the rumor propagates faster than the disease, the fraction of aware (A) nodes decreases with \u03ba, whereas the fraction of stiflers (R) increases very rapidly with \u03ba. This means that the propagation of the information is hindered by the self-awareness of infected stiflers, as they resist to forget the information (unaware) and then become aware (spreaders) again. Notice that, although the stifler population increases in comparison to the aware population, the density of unaware nodes still decreases with \u03ba, meaning that less individuals are unprotected from the disease. Nevertheless, the prevalence (I) increases with \u03ba in this case. This is another counterintuitive result, because the disease prevalence is greater even though the unaware population is smaller. To understand this, we look at the susceptible population: If most susceptible individuals are unaware of the disease, the information is concentrated at infected nodes and thus is not effective in controlling the disease. In Fig. 5 , we study the relative distribution of the susceptible population between unaware (SU), aware (SA), stifler (SR), and the combination of the previous two (SA + SR), using the modified model only. For the case of slower information (\u03c0 = 0.1), FIG. 4 . Normalized stationary densities vs. \u03ba using the modified model (see text), for (a) \u03c0 = 0.1 (fast epidemic spreading) and (b) \u03c0 = 0.9 (fast rumor propagation). Squares and solid lines correspond to MC simulations and the Markov chain approach, respectively. Parameter values are the same as those described in the caption of Fig. 3. the fraction of informed susceptible nodes (SA, SR) increases with \u03ba, as expected. However, when \u03c0 = 0.9, the opposite happens: The fraction of SA and SR decreases and the fraction of susceptible-unaware (SU) nodes increases, meaning that the fraction of susceptible nodes that are protected by the information decreases with \u03ba in this case. Therefore, even if the unaware population is reduced with \u03ba [as reported in Fig. 4(b) ], the information is actually concentrated at infected individuals, making the protection inefficient. In other words, the fraction of informed individuals always increases with \u03ba but, for large \u03c0 , susceptible individuals become less informed as \u03ba increases, and thus the number of infections increases.",

All prevalence values are normalized by the first value of the sequence. For all pairs of topologies, the basic results that we presented before-the increasing of the prevalence with \u03c0 and the reversed behavior with \u03ba for high values of \u03c0 are consistently preserved. Other parameters are set to \u03bc = 0.9, \u03b1 = 0.6, \u03c3 = 0.6.",

We have considered the Maki-Thompson rumor model for the propagation of the information, which incorporates a forgetting mechanism not included in previous related models. Besides, the rumor and disease spread at the same time but under different timescales that control the relative speeds of these two processes. We have verified that the information helps to reduce the prevalence and increase the epidemic threshold of the disease. We have also observed that self-awareness, which keeps infected individuals aware of their condition, is a very effective mechanism for reducing the disease prevalence. However, in the case that the information spreads much faster than the disease, large values of self-awareness can lead to the counterintuitive result of a higher prevalence. This happens because the self-awareness can generate such an excessive number of stiflers that impair the propagation of information, with the overall effect of increasing the prevalence. Therefore, the relative timescales between the information and infection processes determines whether the information awareness is beneficial or not for the magnitude of the epidemics. In this way, our work highlights the important role played by infected individuals who help spreading the information about the disease, reducing the disease transmission and the outbreak.",
