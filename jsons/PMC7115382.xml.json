            "text": "Adenoviruses (AdVs) are non-enveloped double stranded DNA viruses with icosahedral capsid symmetry composed of 252 capsomers. The genome size ranges between 24 and 45 kb [1], [2]. Although adenoviruses were first identified in the early 1950s from the adenoids of humans with acute respiratory infection [3], [4], today, there are over 120 serotypes, isolated from different species, including, mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. While adenoviruses can infect a wide variety of animals, including humans, birds and livestock, they are usually species-specific [2], [5], [6]. AdVs have been proposed to be clustered in five phylogenitically distinct groups namely; Mastadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Atadenovirus, Siadenovirus and Ichtadenovirus, with each virus group having a distinct and characteristic genome structure [7], [8]. The overall genetic organization of members of the Mastadenovirus including human adenovirus (HAdV)-5 [9], canine adenovirus (CAdV)-2 [10], Simian adenovirus (SAdV) [11], bovine adenovirus (BAdV)-3 [12], porcine adenovirus (PAdV)-5 [13] and PAdV-3 [14] appears to be conserved. The Mastadenovirus genome is divided into five discrete transcriptional units. The early regions E1 and E4 are located at either end of the genome, while E2 and E3 are separate and internal. The central core region constitutes the late region. In addition, there are two delayed early transcriptional units named IVa2 and pIX. Despite this genetic conservation, some regions are highly divergent (based on structure of transcripts and proteins) among different members of Mastadenoviruses. In particular, the deduced amino acid sequence of ORFs in the E1, E3 and E4 regions of BAdV-3 show little or no homology to the corresponding proteins encoded by genomes of other members of Mastadenoviruses\n[12]. Since these proteins are involved in virus cell interaction and viral gene expression, variations in these proteins may reflect the diverse host range and pathogenic potential of different members of Mastadenoviruses.\n",

Although recombinant HAdVs have been proven to deliver vaccine antigens to domestic animals [18], [19], [20], [21] and birds [22], [23], regulatory concerns regarding safety has limited their use in domestic animals. Moreover, species specificity limiting host range, restricted replication in non host species and stability of nonhuman adenoviruses has led to the evaluation of animal [CAdV-2 [24], PAdV-3 [25], PAdV-5 [26], BAdV-3 [27], [28] and poultry (Fowl adenovirus (FAdV) [29] specific adenoviruses as vaccine delivery vectors. Since BAdV-3 is a natural nonpathogenic virus with restricted host-range, grows to high titers and can be delivered intranasally without affecting the meat quality of food producing animals, BAdV-3 is being evaluated as vaccine delivery vector in animals including cattle.",

The genome of BAdV-3 is 34, 446 base pairs [12] flanked on either end by 195 bp inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) [30], which play a key role in DNA replication. Unlike other adenoviruses, the ITRs of BAdV-3 are longer and contain a high GC content [12]. Like other adenoviruses, the packaging domain is located in the left end of the viral genome overlapping the transcriptional control region of E1A, but E1A region expression distinctively appears to be essential for packaging in BAdV-3 [31], [32]. Though the TATA or CAAT boxes are absent in the regions between the left ITR and upstream of the E1A start codon, the expression of the E1A open reading frame is driven by a promoter located within the ITR [33].",

Although potential insertion capacity of E3 deleted vector is 3 kb [46], the insertion of 2.8 kb foreign DNA [56] has been successful in generating viable replication-competent recombinant BAdV-3. The foreign open reading frames (ORFs) inserted in E3 are efficiently expressed using upstream endogenous (E3/MLP) promoters [28], [46], [56], [57] or exogenous promoters [56], [57]. However, insertion of foreign ORFs antiparallel to E3 transcription does not lead to the generation of viable recombinant BAdV-3. Moreover, addition of exogenous consensus sequence for polyadenylation of foreign ORF affects the replication efficiency of recombinant BAdV-3 (Lobanov and Tikoo, unpublished data). Interestingly, efficient expression of a RNA virus required addition of an intron and consensus sequence for polyadenylation upstream and downstream, respectively, of the gene [55]. Since E3 deleted recombinant BAdV-3 are replication competent (Fig. 2), less amount of virus may be required to induce a protective immune response.",

To address the concern, the induction of BAdV-3 specific immune response was analyzed in calves containing significant level of pre-existing BAdV-3 specific neutralizing antibodies. The results suggested that intranasal immunization of calves induced significant BAdV-3 specific antibody responses in the presence of BAdV-3 specific neutralizing antibodies [67]. Next, the usefulness of replication-competent BAdV-3 as an effective vaccine delivery vehicle was tested in natural host (calves) containing significant level of pre-existing BAdV-3 specific neutralizing antibodies [27]. We demonstrated the induction of protective immune responses against BHV-1 challenge in calves immunized with recombinant replication-competent BAdV-3 expressing BHV-1 gD/gDt [27]. In this study, calves were immunized twice intranasally, four weeks apart and challenged two weeks later with BHV-1. The immunized calves were protected from clinical disease and showed BHV-1 shedding for reduced time [27]. Thus, species-specific vectors can be developed and used to induce mucosal immunity and protection against a disease in a natural host. Moreover, mucosal (intranasal) immunization helps to bypass the effect of vector (BAdV-3) specific pre-existing antibodies on the induction of protective immune responses. In contrast, intratracheal/subcutaneous immunization with replication-competent recombinant BAdV-3 expressing gDt was not as efficient as intranasal immunization in inducing protective immune responses in calves [65].",

Recently, we demonstrated that single recombinant BAdV-3 expressing vaccine antigens from two respiratory pathogens (gDt of BHV-1 and gG of bovine respiratory syncytial virus [BRSV]) of cattle could be isolated [72]. Moreover, two intranasal immunizations, four weeks apart of calves with single recombinant BAdV-3 expressing BHV-1 gDt and BRSV gG induced significant neutralizing antibodies against BHV-1 and BRSV in cotton rats [72]. Thus, the construction of single recombinant BAdV-3 with multiple vaccine antigens is feasible to induce virus specific immunity for protection from multiple pathogens in calves [72].",

Second, we have provided proof of principle that BAdV-3 minor capsid protein pIX can be used for stable insertion of longer polypeptides exposed on the surface of BAdV-3 virions [86]. Moreover, incorporation of targeting ligand into the C-terminus of pIX enhanced fiber-knob independent tropism of BAdV-3 [86]. BAdV-3 pIX based targeting is being evaluated in developing improved BAdV-3 vectors for bovine vaccination. Thus, it should be possible to exchange the knob region of BAdV-3 fiber with knob region of an adenovirus fiber with tropism for enteric mucosa of cattle to generate BAdV-3 vectored vaccines that can be delivered orally.

Moreover, the development of new generation of veterinary vaccine need to take into account a number of factors including the cost of production, ease of delivery, safety and efficacy. The development and use of vaccines based on BAdV-3 vector system will be cost effect and safe with no risk of producing disease. In addition, these vaccines can also be used for eradication programs since infected and vaccinated animals can be differentiated. Interestingly, intranasal inoculation of calves with wild-type [67] or replication-competent BAdV-3 [27] causes in apparent infection with negligible (number of animals and duration of virus secretion) excreting of virus. Since BAdV-3 has restrictive host range, [35], [44], [90], can be isolated from a healthy cattle [64] and causes in apparent infection in calves [27], [67], the use of replication-competent BAdV-3 vector based vaccines in cattle may not be a major regulatory concern for use in the field. Earlier reports have suggested the oncogenicity of BAdV-3 in Hamster [91] and rat embryo cells [92]. However, like other adenoviruses, BAdV-3 is not known to induce tumor formation in cattle (its natural host). In fact, certain replication competent human adenoviruses (containing transforming E1 region) are already in different phases of clinical trial for certain cancer vaccination and have been used as vaccines in humans [93].",

They also mimic a natural wild-type infection inducing all arms of the immune system including; innate, cellular, humoral and mucosal immunity. Theoretically, replication competent vaccine vectors have the safety of inactivated vaccines and the improved efficacy of live attenuated vaccines [93].",

A phase I clinical trial of an oral, replicating adenovirus-4 vector vaccine for H1N1 influenza in humans was also well tolerated and demonstrated to have a good safety profile with low transmissibility [95]. Generally, experimental inoculation of humans or chimpanzees with replication-competent adenovirus vectors has proven to be safe [95], [96]. Similarly, replication competent BAdV-3 vector is expected to be safe and tolerable in cattle [27], [64], [67].",
