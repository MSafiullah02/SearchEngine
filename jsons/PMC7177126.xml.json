Another goal is to minimise exposure to COVID-19 by reducing visits to hospital by asking patients to stay at home to flatten the pandemic curve.",

Life-threatening or rapidly progressing malignant diseases (eg, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and testicular tumours) have been set as surgical priorities for which the usual standard of care should be maintained. By contrast, in the field of functional urology, given the absence of a formalised concept of disease-related \u201cprognosis\u201d, clear-cut decisions are more difficult to make. This area covers a wide spectrum of clinical situations, sometimes viewed as purely benign conditions or quality-of-life issues. While widespread postponement of such cases is a safe decision during the initial dramatic surge of the pandemic, the reality is more complex. In the short term, recommendations for surgery and routine care probably need to be amended with specific guidance to maintain the level of care and satisfy patient needs. \u201cRescheduling\u201d cannot be the universal answer to this upcoming challenge. Before an evidence-based rationale becomes available to modify our approaches for benign urological diseases, our community will have to rely on common sense to sort out specific emergencies, smartly adapt their practice to a continuously changing situation, and anticipate the future.",

These conditions, although rare, require surgical management without delay in a frail population to avoid severe complications or death [8].

The decision to postpone an invasive procedure is driven by case-by-case discussions. Therefore, we have to carefully monitor patients to provide the usual standard of care for their conditions after resolution of the crisis. It is essential to maintain traceability for all information exchanged on patients during the whole period and make this available for future analyses of possible direct or indirect consequences. To face the post-epidemic phase, which is predicted to last for a few months after confinement, we have to anticipate ways in which to progressively resume our activities to avoid overwhelming the system with complicated cases, rescheduled procedures, and new patients. In this reflection, the outpatient setting may provide unique solutions in the care pathway. Finally, a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of what worked and what failed during these exceptional circumstances will be necessary, hopefully in the coming months, to learn lessons and anticipate any further shortages in health care resources.",
