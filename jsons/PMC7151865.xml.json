            "text": "Because of the similarity in clinical features between infection and AEx-IPF and also the potentially increased susceptibility to infection in these patients secondary to therapy or underlying disease, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of infection at the time of diagnosis of AEx-IPF; it may be unrecognized viral infection. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies showed that AEx-IPF is more frequent in patients taking immunosuppressive drugs8, 9 and in winter and spring8, 10 seasons, when respiratory viral infection is common. To confirm this hypothesis, Wooten et al. studied the presence of virus in prospectively collected BAL fluid of 43 AEx-IPF patients using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, panviral microarray, and high-throughput cDNA sequencing and found respiratory viruses in only six patients (two rhinoviruses and one each of parainfluenza, coronavirus, herpes simplex, and Epstein-Barr virus) and torque teno virus in 12 patients, but the significance of torque teno virus was not certain because it was detected in a similar percentage of the samples of an acute lung injury control group.11 Later, Bando et al. reported that it seemed to be unlikely that torque teno virus would be directly involved in the onset of AEx-IPF but it could reflect the immunosuppressive state of the host because of treatment.12 Several other studies also confirmed the low prevalence of infective organism in AEx-IPF.12, 13, 14, 15 These results suggest that the majority of AEx-IPF is not infection, although there is still a possibility of viral triggering of acute lung injury and disappearance at the time of clinical presentation.",

            "text": "Because aspiration of gastric contents can cause acute lung injury, manifested by DAD on lung biopsy,16 occult aspiration of gastric contents has been proposed as one possible cause of AEx-IPF.4, 17 Joyce Lee et al. measured the BAL pepsin level of 24 patients with AEx-IPF and 30 stable IPF controls and showed measurable BAL pepsin in most patients with stable IPF, suggesting that occult aspiration is common in IPF. Eight (33%) of the AEx-IPF patients had high BAL pepsin levels, suggesting that occult aspiration may play a role in some cases.18 Another study showed a significantly higher rate of gastroesophageal reflux and acute exacerbations in patients with asymmetric IPF, and most of the exacerbation occurred in the more affected side (right lung), the dependent side during sleep.19 A post hoc analysis of the placebo arms from three clinical trials showed that AEx-IPF occurred only in those subjects not on antacid therapy (proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker), presumably because antacid therapy reduces the potential for microaspiration-related lung injury.17 Furthermore, among the 242 patients assigned to the placebo groups of the three trials, 124 patients taking antacid treatment at baseline had a smaller decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 30 weeks, suggesting that antacid treatment could be beneficial in patients with IPF, and abnormal acid gastroesophageal reflux seems to contribute to disease progression.20 However, recent post hoc analyses of the INPULSIS clinical trials showed that the incidence of AEx-IPF among the placebo group who were taking antacids at baseline was very high compared with other groups21 and FVC had declined in greater degree compared with the patients who received no antacid medication at baseline, suggesting that patients treated with antacid at baseline may actually do worse.21 The reason for this contradictory result is not certain; it may be due to the persistent acid gastroesophageal reflux after antacid therapy and/or the nonacid components present in the refluxate. These results suggest that although in some patients aspiration may trigger AEx-IPF, the majority of AEx-IPF cases are not caused by aspiration. The role of gastroesophageal reflux in AEx-IPF and IPF itself is not certain, and further prospective study to verify the efficacy of antacid is warranted.",

Although research is ongoing, the molecular mechanisms underlying AEx-IPF remain poorly understood. Activation of the immune system, disordered coagulation/fibrinolysis, and oxidative stress may all contribute to the pathophysiology of AEx-IPF.22 Because AEx-IPF is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) clinically, radiologically, and pathologically, the pathobiology may also be similar. To investigate this possibility, Collard et al. compared the biomarker profile of stable IPF, AEx-IPF, and ARDS. In ARDS, the levels of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a marker of type I alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury/proliferation, proinflammatory cytokines, markers of endothelial dysfunction, activated coagulation, and inhibited fibrinolysis were all elevated, whereas the AEx-IPF group had lower levels of RAGE and higher levels of Krebs von Lungen-6 (KL-6) and surfactant protein-D (markers of type II AEC proliferation and/or injury), which was similar to stable IPF but in greater degree.23 The absence of a type I cell injury signature combined with an exuberant elevation of type II cell markers provides support for the hypothesis that AEx-IPF is predominantly a manifestation of the acceleration of an underlying disease process, rather than the result of a second, different kind of injury.",

Therefore the revised definition of AEx of IPF is: an acute, clinically significant, respiratory deterioration characterized by evidence of new, widespread alveolar abnormality in patients with IPF. It is more inclusive and results in diagnostic criteria that are more feasible for clinicians and clinical trialists, who have had difficulty in the requirement for invasive microbiologic evaluation of the 2007 criteria.",

            "text": "Clinical trials of several investigational treatments for IPF suggested that chronic treatment of IPF might reduce the incidence of AEx-IPF. A trial of sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, showed a numerical reduction in AEx-IPF in patients given sildenafil versus placebo (3.4% vs. 7.6%),85 but the number of events was small and the difference was not statistically significant. A Phase II study of pirfenidone in Japanese patients with IPF was terminated early based on a higher frequency of AEx-IPF in the placebo group than in the pirfenidone group.86 However, in a Phase III trial in Japan, no significant differences were observed.87 The definitive Phase III clinical trials of pirfenidone did not report acute exacerbations as an endpoint.88, 89 Pirfenidone has been suggested to reduce the risk of AEx postoperatively, but these data are only observational and therefore are at high risk for confounding.90 All three placebo-controlled clinical trials of nintedanib included AEx as a key secondary endpoint. In a Phase II trial of nintedanib, time to first investigator-reported AEx was delayed in the nintedanib group.91 However, in Phase III trials, one trial demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of acute exacerbations with nintedanib, but the other trial showed no significant difference.92 Pooled data demonstrated a 68% reduction in the risk of an adjudicated confirmed or suspected AEx with nintedanib therapy (5.7% on placebo vs. 1.9% on nintedanib, P\n = .01).92 Pooled data and metaanalyses of data from the Phase II TOMORROW trial and two Phase III INPULSIS trials including 1231 patients (nintedanib n = 723, placebo n = 508) showed the hazard ratio for time to first AEx was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.83; P\n = .0047) in favor of nintedanib.93 No other trial drugs (acetylcysteine monotherapy, bosentan, interferon-\u03b3, sildenafil) showed impact on prevention of AEx-IPF, and ambrisentan, imatinib, \u201ctriple therapy\u201d (combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and acetylcysteine), and warfarin actually increased the risk of IPF.72, 73, 85, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100\n",

Many studies performed after the 2007 consensus report suggested that AEx-IPF may be an acute acceleration of an underlying fibroproliferative process triggered by various extrinsic or unknown insults in patients with IPF, who already have a predisposition to exaggerated fibrosis due to abnormal wound healing. Previously, it was defined as an idiopathic acute worsening of respiratory condition in patients with IPF, but recently an international working group proposed a new definition, which removes \u201cidiopathic\u201d and thus excludes the necessity of invasive procedures for the diagnosis, because there is little clinical or biologic support for distinguishing idiopathic from nonidiopathic respiratory events. It is hoped that this new definition and diagnostic criteria will improve the feasibility of future research to find effective treatment.\n",
