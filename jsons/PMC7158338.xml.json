One of the biggest hurdles is that cat owners are often unaware of the medical needs of their cat and the importance of feline preventive care.56 Troubling statistics indicate that dogs are taken to the veterinarian more than twice as often as cats; dogs generally visit the veterinarian 2.3 times per year, whereas cats see the veterinarian only 1.1 times per year.56 From 33% to 36% cats do not see a veterinarian even once annually. In households with both cats and dogs, the cats received less veterinary care than the dogs, with adult cats especially lacking in preventive care.56 Unfortunately, adult cats have many diseases that are overlooked, such as obesity, dental and lower urinary tract diseases, and behavioral problems. Adult cats are also more likely to be surrendered because of behavior problems. Lack of care has an impact on quality of life and longevity.",

Clients do not care how much the veterinarian knows until they know how much the veterinarian cares for them and their cats. Information on feline-friendly handling is found in Chapter 1, and the hospital environment in Chapter 2. Whether the hospital is for cats only or companion animals or is a mixed animal practice, the veterinary staff should take steps to make feline veterinary visits more pleasant. Providing a separate waiting room area for cats or placing them directly in an examination room to avoid the stressors of the reception area (e.g., noise, smells, visual cues) is one way the hospital environment can be more feline friendly. If a particular staff member in a companion animal or mixed animal hospital has a special talent for working with cats and their owners, that person can be scheduled to work with all feline appointments. Information to ease the difficulty of getting the cat to the veterinary hospital can be provided when the client makes the appointment.",

The expenses may be met through existing savings, credit card reserves, Care Credit or other medical payment cards, monthly budgeting for pet care expenses, or pet health insurance policies.BOX 8-1Internet ResourcesGeneral Preventive Care Recommendations\n\u2022AAHA Statement on Meeting the Cost of Pet Care\u2022\nhttp://www.aahanet.org/\n\n\u2022Pet Insurance Review\u2022\nhttp://www.petinsurancereview.com\n\n\u2022AVMA policy on electronic identification\u2022\nhttp://www.avma.org/issues/policy/electronic_identification.asp\n\n\u2022WSAVA microchip identification\u2022\nhttp://www.wsava.org/MicrochipID.htm\n\n\u2022AAHA Pet Microchip Lookup Tool\u2022\nhttp://www.petmicrochiplookup.org/\n\n\u2022Chloe Standard, Inc., Check the Chip\u2022\nhttp://www.checkthechip.com/\n\n\nDisaster Preparedness\n\u2022American Humane Association\u2014Don't Leave Your Pet's Safety To Chance\u2022\nhttp://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/who-we-are/american-humane-blog/blog-posts/dont-leave-your-pets-safety.html\n\n\u2022AVMA Saving the Whole Family booklet\u2022\nhttp://www.avma.org/disaster/saving_family.asp\n\n\u2022Humane Society of the United States, Disaster Preparedness for Pets\u2022\nhttp://www.hsus.org/hsus_field/hsus_disaster_center/resources/disaster_preparedness_for_pets.html\n\n\u2022ASPCA Disaster Preparedness\u2022\nhttp://www.aspca.org/pet-care/disaster-preparedness/\n\n\nEstate Planning\n\u2022AVMA Pet Estate Planning\u2022\nhttp://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/dec01/s120101e.asp\n\n\u2022Humane Society of the United States\u2014Planning Your Estate?\u2022\nhttp://www.hsus.org/press_and_publications/press_releases/planning_your_estate_the.html\n\n\nEnvironmental Enrichment\n\u2022The Indoor Cat Initiative, The Ohio State University\u2022\nhttp://www.vet.osu.edu/indoorcat.htm\n\n\u2022AAFP Feline Behavior Guidelines, 2004\u2022\nhttp://www.catvets.com/professionals/guidelines/publications/?Id=177\n\n\nClaw Care\n\u2022AAFP Position Statement on Declawing\u2022\nhttp://www.catvets.com/professionals/guidelines/position/?Id=291\n\n\u2022AAHA Declawing (Onychectomy) Position Statement\u2022\nhttp://www.aahanet.org\n\n\u2022AVMA Position Statement on the Declawing of Domestic Cats\u2022\nhttp://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/apr03/030415c.asp\n\n\u2022CVMA Position Statement on Declawing\u2022\nhttp://canadianveterinarians.net/ShowText.aspx?ResourceID=28\n\n\u2022Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine: Trimming Your Cat's Claws\u2022\nhttp://www.partnersah.vet.cornell.edu/pet/fhc/trimming_claws\n\n\nTesting for Inherited Diseases\n\u2022University of California\u2014Davis, Veterinary Genetics Laboratory\u2022\nhttp://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/cat/\n\n\u2022Washington State University, Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab\u2022\nhttp://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/deptsVCGL/\n\n\u2022University of Pennsylvania, PennGen Laboratories\u2022\nhttp://research.vet.upenn.edu/Default.aspx?alias=research.vet.upenn.edu/penngen\n\n\nDental Care\n\u2022American Veterinary Dental Society\u2022\nhttp://www.avds-online.org/\n\n\u2022Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine\u2014Brushing Your Cat's Teeth\u2022\nhttp://partnersah.vet.cornell.edu/pet/fhc/brushing_teeth\n\n\u2022Veterinary Oral Health Council\u2014Products awarded the VOHC Seal\u2022\nhttp://www.vohc.org/accepted_products.htm\n\n\nParasite Control\n\u2022Companion Animal Parasite Council\u2022\nhttp://www.capcvet.org/\n\n\u2022European Scientific Counsel Companion Animal Parasites\u2022\nhttp://www.esccap.org/\n\n\u2022Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014Healthy Pets, Healthy People\u2022\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/index.htm\n\n\u2022American Heartworm Society\u2022\nhttp://www.heartwormsociety.org/\n\n\n",

Cats need resources in the home to allow them to perform their normal behavior: scratching posts in desirable locations and cat trees, perches, or shelves to allow for climbing and resting and to increase overall space in the home (Figure 8-6\n). Normal feeding behavior and multiple toileting (litter box) areas are also necessary. Many cats also like hiding spots, especially in multicat households, households with children, and when company visits. Queens teach kittens to play so that they learn to hunt for food and catch their prey; play is an important component of the cat's day. Cats are social animals and enjoy both interactive toys and hunting games. They also enjoy playing on their own; rotation of toys prevents boredom. There are excellent resources to educate veterinary teams and cat owners about cats\u2019 needs and environmental enrichment. The Indoor Cat Initiative (see Box 8-1) provides outstanding information, as does Chapter 46.

Litter boxes are an excellent example showing why cats need multiple resources. The recommendation for the number of litter boxes is traditionally one litter box per cat plus one extra, so that a household with three cats should contain four litter boxes, placed in different locations. In a multiple-floor dwelling, a minimum of one box should be placed on each floor to which the cats have access. This allows cats to have easy access to a litter box regardless of where the cat is in the house and reduces the risk of another cat blocking access to the cat or bothering it while it is eliminating. Boxes should be located in easily accessible areas but not high-traffic areas. Most cats prefer unscented clumping litter,65, 70 and some cats may find scented litters aversive. Kittens may be offered a variety of litter box options from which to choose, with one choice being unscented clumping litter.66 Litter boxes should be scooped at least once daily and changed completely once weekly for clay litter and once every 2 weeks for clumping litter. Cats also prefer litter boxes66 large enough for them to turn around in; the ideal size is approximately 1.5 times the size of the cat, from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail.70 Most commercial cat litter boxes are too small; plastic clothes storage boxes and dog litter boxes for dogs up to 35 pounds are excellent choices (Figure 8-7\n). Cats with arthritis and other health problems that make it difficult to jump over the edge of the box should be provided with a box that has a smaller lip or edge at the front of the box; dog litter boxes already have these. Otherwise, an opening can be cut in a sweater or other plastic box.",

If kittens associate positive experiences with exposure to humans during this time, they will be more willing to approach people and be held by them later in life. Kittens should be handled gently and positively and exposed as early as possible to any stimuli or handling techniques the cat may encounter during their lifetime (e.g., children, dogs, nail trims, tooth brushing, car rides) (FIGURE 8-8, FIGURE 8-9\n). Positive carrier, car, and veterinary experiences that occur early in life can improve future veterinary visits (Figure 8-10\n).

Although declawing was once considered a routine procedure in the United States, it is now ethically controversial. The current position statements (see Box 8-1) of the AVMA, the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, the AAFP, and the AAHA state that declawing should be considered only after efforts are made to prevent the cat from using the claws destructively (e.g., scratching posts, nail trimming) or for cats that live with immunocompromised people for whom clawing may present a zoonotic disease or injury risk. Zoonotic disease potential should be discussed and documented in the medical record. If declawing is performed, four-paw declawing is not recommended; keeping the hind claws allows the cat some means of protection, and property destruction and human injury occur less commonly with the rear claws. There are good alternatives to onychectomy, including training cats to use scratching posts and trimming their nails regularly. In most cases clients can be taught to trim nails, especially with kittens. Nails should be trimmed in a calm environment, and the cat should be positively reinforced. In addition to nail-trimming demonstrations, at-home education can be reinforced with client educational handouts or a video on nail trimming (see Box 8-1). The client educational handout \u201cHow To Prevent Cats from Scratching in Undesirable Areas\u201d is provided at the end of the AAFP Feline Behavior Guidelines.70 Another alternative is temporary synthetic nail caps that are usually applied every 4 to 6 weeks.",

Pet adopters also can identify cats with possible genetic problems before purchase, which is helpful for breeding and pet purposes. When clients want to purchase a cat of a breed with known genetic diseases, veterinarians can advise them to request results of genetic testing for both parents and, if available, the kitten. Many laboratories offering genetic testing accept samples collected with a cheek swab.

For example, the veterinarian might say, \u201cDental prophylaxis is recommended for cats every year, starting at 1 year of age, to prevent periodontal disease.\u201d41 Dental prophylaxis should be done in cats with an essentially healthy mouth or with mild gingivitis.41 Patients with dental disease should undergo dental treatment or oral surgery. It is important to explain to clients that prophylaxis involves removing plaque and calculus both supragingivally (above the gum line) and subgingivally (below the gum line). Cleaning only above the gum line has no therapeutic effect; it is the plaque and calculus below the gum line that cause periodontal disease, the most common dental disease in cats. Dental prophylaxis includes several important steps, and the American Veterinary Dental Society has developed an excellent educational piece that may be used to educate clients about the steps of dental prophylaxis and other needed dental care (see Box 8-1).",

Home care can maintain or improve dental health.77 Tooth brushing is the gold standard of home dental care. It is best to begin client education about tooth brushing when the patient is a kitten. However, even older cats can be trained to accept tooth brushing, and this should be recommended for them routinely. Client compliance for adult cats may increase if education follows dental prophylaxis or treatment because these clients are more aware of dental health problems. Tooth brushing should never be done in a forceful manner or when the client is at risk of being injured. It is best to train the cat with positive reinforcement, starting first by lifting the lips and immediately giving the cat a treat. Then the client can try to give the cat a little seafood or poultry toothpaste, which, with any luck, the cat will find palatable. The conditioning or training may take 1 week or more, but with continued positive reinforcement of the desired behavior, it is successful in most cats. Providing clients with verbal instruction and supplemental information on tooth brushing is helpful; the Cornell Feline Health Center has a helpful video (see Box 8-1).",

Although home-prepared diets may be used to support all feline life stages, ensuring that all macronutritional and micronutritional needs are adequately provided in such foods can be problematic, and there may be risks associated with the use or feeding of raw foods (e.g., transmission of infectious diseases). Commercially available dry or wet foods that meet the specific nutritional requirements of cats at the appropriate life stage and have been tested in feeding trials are the best way to ensure that a diet is satisfactory.99 Development of food preferences in cats is complex and incompletely understood. Studies of feeding behavior in cats have demonstrated a so-called monotony effect in which cats may develop an aversion to foods that have formed a large part of their diet. This may be a protective mechanism; eating a variety of foods may reduce the likelihood of an unbalanced or deficient diet. However, although the monotony effect has been demonstrated in both kittens and adults, it appears to be much stronger in free-ranging cats and can be abrogated, at least in part, in cats raised on nutritionally complete diets.10 Kittens are also strongly influenced in their food preferences by their mothers,10, 101 and a primacy effect may be seen whereby adult cats develop a strong preference for their weaning or normal diet.10, 90\n",

Adult worms measuring 8 to 15 cm in length are found in the small intestine, with ova being shed in the feces after a prepatent period of approximately 5 to 7 weeks for T. cati and around 9 to 12 weeks for T. leonina. The life cycle can be either direct (through ingestion of infective ova) or indirect (through ingestion of infected paratenic hosts such as rodents, birds, worms, or mollusks). In contrast to dogs, there is no transplacental migration with Toxocara spp. in cats, although infection with T. cati leads to liver\u2013lung migration of larvae, and because larvae may also be present in the milk of queens, they can be transmitted to neonatal kittens. Diagnosis of infection is through fecal flotation techniques to demonstrate the presence of ova. However, routine fecal examination may not always detect the presence of an infection, and because these ascarids are prevalent and T. cati should be considered a zoonosis, routine prophylaxis (discussed later) is always recommended.",

The vaccine site recommendations are as follows:\u2022FPV, FHV-1, FCV (\u00b1 C. felis): given subcutaneously on the lateral right forelimb below the elbow\u2022Rabies: given subcutaneously on the lateral right hindlimb below the stifle\u2022FeLV and/or FIV: given subcutaneously on the lateral left hindlimb below the stifle\u2022Site of other medications should be recorded\n",
