            "text": "The Damage-Response Framework (DRF) is an integrated theory that views microbial pathogenesis as an outcome of hostmicrobe interaction [1] . Formulated in 1999, the DRF first served as an educational tool for the inaugural microbial pathogenesis course at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, for which we were course leaders. Although we were invited to teach the course because we were scientists, it was our experiences as infectious diseases physicians that convinced us of the need for an integrated theory of microbial pathogenesis. At that time (the 1990s), the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS pandemic raged in New York City. Many of our patients were terminally ill with cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, and pneumocystis pneumonia, diseases never before seen in such a large number of patients. Equally as vexing was a marked increase in cases of disease with Candida albicans and Staphylococcus epidermidis, microbes only rarely considered pathogens during our infectious diseases training. Available concepts of microbial pathogenesis and virulence simply could not explain how such microbes could cause disease in some patients, but not others, or how so many rare infectious diseases could suddenly emerge. In an attempt to define pathogenic microbes based on the hosts in whom they caused disease, the terms \"opportunistic\" and \"primary\" pathogen were used. For example, Candida albicans was opportunistic in patients with AIDS and a primary pathogen in normal women with vaginitis. However, this was futile and imprecise because the same microbe required different terms for different hosts and the terms did not account for host variables that affect susceptibility [1, 2] . Thus, the microbial pathogenesis field lacked an integrated theory that could account for the role that the host plays in the outcome of infection.",

On the microbial side, the view was that microbes were disease perpetrators with virulence factors that acted upon the host to cause disease. This concept led to a substantial scientific effort to identify such factors, although singular factors able to cause disease universally were not found for many microbes. On the host side, immune impairment was viewed as rendering the host vulnerable to microbes that only cause disease in the setting of immune defects (eg, opportunistic pathogens). Although these views were able to explain certain diseases in certain patients, they could not explain others [3] . As we reviewed our own experiences from the lenses of infectious diseases physicians and scientists, we realized that the state of disease was actually only 1 possible outcome of host-microbe interaction. Other important outcomes were the microbial states of colonization, latency, and commensalism. It was also difficult to reconcile the occurrence of disease with commensal microbes such as Candida and Staphylococcus spp. with existing concepts. As clinicians, we realized that patients changed, because they acquired HIV/ AIDS, or because they had an indwelling catheter, or because they were receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics or immunosuppressive drugs, or because their environment changed [4] . As scientists, we realized that microbes changed too, because they acquired resistance from antibiotic use and misuse, or because their habitat or environment changed. Our knowledge as physician-scientists led us to recognize that, together, patient and microbial change resulted in the emergence of new diseases and unsuspected outcomes of infection, highlighting that microbial virulence requires a susceptible host and is not a stable or singular microbial trait [3, 5, 6] .",

Given that not everyone who acquires a microbe gets sick and the state that ensues after infection can vary among patients or within the same patient over time, we reasoned that the common denominator of host-microbe interaction and most relevant factor to assess its outcome should be host damage. This led us to put forth the following DRF tenets, which we view as incontrovertible: (1) microbial pathogenesis is 1 outcome of an interaction between a host and a microbe; (2) the host-relevant outcome of host-microbe interaction is host damage; (3) host damage can stem from microbial factors, host factors, or both. These tenets made it possible to account for the host and the microbe in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.",

In this formulation, host-microbe interaction is represented by a point on the parabola corresponding to a certain amount of damage on the Y-axis as a function of the immune response on the X-axis, ranging from weak on the left to strong on the right ( Figure 1 ). The left-hand side of the parabola fit well with the clinical observation that some people are vulnerable to certain infectious diseases because of weak immunity, whereby an inability to control microbial growth may lead to host damage. The right-hand side of the parabola fit with the concept that some infectious diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever, can be the result of strong, often excessive, immune responses.",

The occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was a transformative moment for the DRF. Clinical and experimental data demonstrated that the immune response to the SARS coronavirus contributed to the severity of this disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome occurred in young, previously healthy persons. This suggested that the pathogenesis of this syndrome differed from viral diseases that occur in infants and the elderly with weak immunity. The disease process in young persons with SARS was marked by intense pulmonary inflammation and hemorrhage due to immunological damage [7] . This echoed the retrospective discovery that the 1918 influenza virus elicited inflammatory damage [8, 9] and underscores the importance of recognizing the right-hand side of the parabola in clinical practice. For example, cytokine storm plays a central role in the pathogenesis of influenza, dengue, Ebola, and malaria [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and in inflammation-enhanced mortality of young people with pandemic influenza [15] . The right-hand side of the parabola may also provide an explanation for reduced efficacy and greater risk of severe dengue in younger dengue-naive vaccine recipients [16, 17] .",

This will require scientific advances, such as more robust and complex measures of damage, ways to quantify host damage as a function of the host response, and more robust and complex measures of microbial states. There is also a need to find ways to integrate these measures in clinical practice to correlate clinical states with measures of damage. This will make it possible to develop and select therapies that will move the patient to an appropriate damage-reducing point on the parabola (Figure 2 ). Although development of measures to place patients on the parabola seems like a daunting task, new platforms may hold promise. For example, machine-learning approaches that incorporate clinical information with host and microbial measures may identify biological surrogates of clinical states of diseases, as described for malaria [28] . Electronic health records and big data platforms that can integrate genetic, immunologic, clinical, microbial, and environmental variables also hold promise as tools to integrate patient and microbial characteristics and identify measures that correlate with defined clinical and microbial states. Even today, clinical parameters, fungal burden, immunological measures, and cytokine perturbations that correlate with HIV-associated cryptococcosis [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] may provide insight into where a patient may lie on the parabola.",

However, statins may dampen the response to influenza vaccine [38, 39] and have other untoward effects.

Clinically, such antibodies could move the parabola down (less damage) and to the left. One mechanism by which they may do so is by promoting cellular microbial uptake and preventing bacterial engagement of host receptors that initiate inflammation [45] . Thus, antibodies are agents that can promote an inflammation-sparing state that benefits the host, as well as augment the immune response [47] . The former could be helpful in pneumococcal pneumonia, a condition that is often marked by inflammation that persists after bacterial clearance. Another way antibodies can dampen inflammation is via direct microbial effects. Antibodies to bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi that alter microbial transcription, metabolism, or growth have been described [48] [49] [50] [51] and may hold promise as therapeutic agents.",

            "text": "The DRF is a conceptually simple and flexible theory that can account for myriad outcomes of host-microbe interaction. When first proposed at the dawn of the 21st century, the DRF was an important conceptual advance because it included host response as a variable in microbial pathogenesis. In addition, it shifted the view of microbial pathogenesis from a singular focus on either the host or the microbe to the outcome of their interaction. Hence, the DRF can explain how the same microbe and host can coexist in a commensal relationship at one time and have a pathogenic relationship at another time. Importantly, the DRF is flexible and can accommodate new information. For example, as noted above, clinical and experimental evidence that immune damage can drive the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis [27, 52] revealed a place on the right-hand side of the parabola for C. neoformans [23] . Importantly, the DRF applies to both individuals and populations [2] and thus can provide insight into host-microbe interaction at the patient and epidemiological level. The DRF provides a way to integrate clinical information and basic science to develop paradigms to better understand the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and inform the development of rationally designed immunotherapy and vaccines. Physician-scientists, who can translate observations made in the clinic to the bench and vice versa, are perfectly poised to lead the way forward with approaches that will make DRF-based management of infectious diseases a reality.",
