Even in periods of apparent control of the pandemic, surveillance must be maintained, as the risk of a resurgence of new COVID-19 waves may be possible until 2024 [4] . The emergence of new respiratory diseases in the future, such as COVID-19, should also be considered at this time. Knowledge about host factors, especially preventable factors such as active and passive smoking, may be important in reducing the severity of the disease and, consequently, decreasing the number of deaths [1] . Tobacco-free policies must be maintained and strengthened. Moreover, the training of health students in relation to the perception, counseling and guidance of smoking patients can be crucial. Health professionals should be also able to discourage the emergence of new smokers [5] .",

Particularly for oral cavity, although the current trends in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) indicate an increasing prevalence in young and non-smoker patients, most oral SCC still occur in older smokers [6] . In former smokers, the risk for head and neck cancer (HNC) have decreased after 1 to 4 years (OR 0.70) after smoking cessation. After 20 years of quitting smoking, the risk of oral and pharyngeal cancer was similar to that of never smokers [7] . At any time, smoking cessation is crucial. A large population-based study reveals that smoking at diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor for cancerspecific survival in head and neck cancer [8] . Considering the current global health crisis, concern about the COVID-19 pandemic may encourage smoking cessation, resulting in a greater number of patients who need counseling and guidance to quitting smoking. In this likely scenario, is health professional and students training, particularly dental and medical students, suitable to patients counseling for smoking cessation? this survey, pointing out that more than 80% of health students find that health professionals have a role in counseling patients about smoking cessation. However, less than 40% of students reported having received any formal training on tobacco cessation approaches and smoking counselling during their professional training [9] .",
