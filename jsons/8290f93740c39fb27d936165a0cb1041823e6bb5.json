Previous work showed intensive care unit (ICU) population structure impacts methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates. Unexplored in that work was the transient dynamics of this system. We consider the dynamics of MRSA in an ICU in three different models: 1) a Ross-McDonald model with a single healthcare staff type, 2) a Ross-McDonald model with nurses and doctors considered as separate populations and 3) a meta-population model that segments patients into smaller groups seen by a single nurse. The basic reproduction number, R 0 is derived using the Next Generation Matrix method, while the importance of the position of patients within the meta-population model is assessed via stochastic simulation. The single-staff model had an R 0 of 0.337, while the other two models had R 0 s of 0.278. The meta-population model's R 0 was not sensitive to the time nurses spent with their assigned patients vs. unassigned patients. This suggests previous results showing that simulated infection rates are dependent on this parameter are the result of differences in the transient dynamics between the models, rather than differing long-term equilibria.",

MRSA is most often treated with vancomycin, a drug with a myriad of potential side effects, and a treatment failure rate of nearly 50% [3] . Because of the difficulty in treating patients with MRSA once they have developed a clinical infection, a great deal of time and attention is placed on the prevention of the initial colonization of a patient with the bacteria, involving interventions such as hand hygiene or contact precautions.",

            "text": "We consider a 18-bed, single occupancy ICU, where patients are assumed, due to their critical status, to be immobile. As MRSA is not airborne, this then restricts the available MRSA transmission pathways to strictly healthcare worker (HCW) mediated patient-to-patient transmission. The role of environmental contamination is represented by modeling the contact rate in terms of \"direct care tasks\", which involve a healthcare worker touching either a patient or their surrounding environment, rather than in terms of patient body-contacts alone. As previously described, several several different variations for our model ICU are analyzed. The Single Staff Type model (Figure 1 ), is the most basic model, but also the one most closely resembling the conventional Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) or Ross-McDonald models [5] used most commonly in the study of HAIs. Here, all 18 patients are considered one well-mixed group with 7 total health care workers, each using a weighted average of nurse-and doctor-specific contact rates. In the second model (Figure 2 ), the 18 patients are still viewed as a group, but the six nurses are separated from the single doctor, who now also have role-specific contact rates. Finally, we represent the ICU as a meta-population (Figure 3 ), wherein the patients are no longer lumped together but instead placed in groups of three with a single nurse attending each group while the doctor sees all patients. An important feature of this model is the inclusion of a parameter, \u03b3, which represents the proportion of time a nurse spends with their assigned patient group. When \u03b3 = 1 this can be considered a strict assignment, whereas the system is equivalent to a mass action model when \u03b3 = 1 C , where C is the number of patient groups. The value of this parameter has been shown in previous simulation work [4] to non-linearly decrease the number of incident acquisitions of MRSA within the ICU with increasing values of \u03b3. This formulation also reflects many of the realities of staffing, the desire for continuity of care between healthcare providers, and even the hospital built environment, where the placement of patient beds, nursing stations, etc. creates logical groupings. A table containing the parameter values can be found 7.1.",

Subsequently the eigenvalues for the matrix F * V \u22121 are calculated using the disease free equilibrium to eliminate any remaining variables.

This pattern remained significant for the third acquisition in the no colonized admissions scenario (p = 0.02), but not in the colonized admissions scenario. By the fourth acquisition, both starting conditions were statistically indistinguishable within each scenario. Also notably, as the value of R 0 for these models were well below one, the majority of the simulations in the scenario with no further colonized admissions experienced rapid stochastic extinction of the pathogen. Scenarios with the two seed patients treated by different nurses were slightly less likely to go stochastically extinct, with 41.0% of iterations (vs. 31.9%) having a new acquisition within the hospital, and 0.66% iterations (vs. 0.43%) having transmission continue to a third acquisition.

Counter to the intuition from previous work that a lower simulated infection rate in the meta-population model would correspond to a lower R 0 , we see that this model has an equivalent R 0 to the Nurse-MD model. This in turn suggests that the differences seen in the models are not due to differing long-term equilibria, but rather the impact of transient dynamics and follow-on impacts from those subtle initial differences. Similarly, the difference in the initial starting placement of colonized patients within the structured population of the ICU can have considerable ramifications on the first few subsequent transmission events, though in a setting with incoming colonized patients this is quickly washed out by the noise generated by new admissions. While at first glance the necessary modifications to obtain a disease-free equilibrium to calculate R 0 might seem unrealistic, this adjustment can be thought of as a representation of the transmission of a rare disease that is not yet prevalent in the community from which a hospital draws its patients. Examples of such pathogens might include emerging disease in the United States such as Candida auris or Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, as well as more exotic imported diseases which have caused notable issues in healthcare settings, such as Ebola or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",

            "text": "Also evident within the results is the suggestion that placing colonized patients under the care of the same nurse (known as \"cohorting\") does help control the spread of MRSA in our model. We can also see through Figures 7 and 8 that barring the onslaught of incoming patients already colonized with MRSA, the idea of grouping colonized patients under the care of the same nurse is actually very effective at reducing the spread of the pathogen. The practical challenge to this practice becomes the effective detection of colonized patients, with or without evident clinical symptoms. Exploring the effectiveness of cohorting under less ideal circumstances, with imperfect diagnostics, delays in diagnostic lab results, etc. remains an area for future work. Additionally, the contrast between figures 7 and 8 versus figures 5 and 6 suggest that this may only be true in circumstances where the admission rate of colonized patients is at or near zero. Even with a relatively low 7.79% admission prevalence, the benefit of cohorting is quickly swamped by the colonization pressure from these new colonized patients. It is possible that a more dynamic patient admission scheme (at present incoming patients are allocated randomly) might preserve the benefits of cohorting under some circumstances. The difficulties in implementing such a scheme on a routine basis for multiple pathogens in a clinical setting are considerable, and moreso in the case of emerging pathogens. Never the less, these results point to the considerable importance of an ICU's population structure in shaping the dynamics of within-hospital infection transmission, highlighting the need for research into how these structures can be shaped by the hospital built environment, staff scheduling, hospital policy and other factors.",
