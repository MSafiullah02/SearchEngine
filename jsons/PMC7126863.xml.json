Such self-protective actions will influence the network topology and may significantly change the predicted course of epidemic dynamic  [8], [9]. Based on the Susceptible\u2013Infected\u2013Susceptible (SIS) model, Gross et al. proposed the adaptive network to depict the impact of the dynamic change of network structure on epidemic spreading  [10]. In their model, the network structure changed all the time according to the states of neighboring nodes and this in turn affected epidemic dynamics. Specifically, the susceptible individuals might protect themselves by rewiring their links. The susceptible node would break the link (SI link) with the infected node based on a fixed probability and form a new link with another randomly selected susceptible node. Following this, there are many literatures studying the epidemic propagation on an adaptive network. Shaw et al. analyzed the epidemic spreading process in adaptive networks based on Susceptible\u2013Infected\u2013Recovered\u2013Susceptible (SIRS) model  [11]. Lagorio et al. studied the critical effect of quarantine on the epidemic propagation on an adaptive social contact network  [12]. Guo et al. proposed a continuous-time Adaptive Susceptible\u2013Infected\u2013Susceptible (ASIS) model to study the interplay between epidemic dynamics and the dynamics of network structure  [13]. Song et al. introduced a new preferentially reconnecting edge strategy of adaptive networks depending on spatial distance. For this rewiring strategy, when an SI link was broken, the S node would reconnect to a random node with probability p and a neighboring node with probability 1-p. They found that a smaller value of probability p led to a slower epidemic spreading  [14].",

            "text": "However, prior works have several main limitations. First, rewiring strategy in adaptive network has been accepted as an effective strategy to suppress the epidemic spreading  [15], [16]. Many factors that influence the rewiring strategy were explored  [14], [17]. However, interpersonal relations, generally present in the social network, are seldom considered. Though relation has attracted more and more attention in the static network research  [18], [19], it is still unclear how the relation affects the epidemic propagation in adaptive networks. Second, the rewiring mechanism of adaptive network models  [20] includes two processes, that is, link-breaking and link-creating, which are explored by most studies. But these studies only considered the influencing factors of link-creating process (such as spatial space  [14], [17]), and the influencing factors related with link-breaking process were ignored. In this study, we incorporated interpersonal relation as the influencing factor of link-breaking process. Thus the link would not be broken randomly but according to the relation intimacy between two nodes that lie in two sides of a link. Third, vaccination is an important fundamental method to block transmission of diseases for the fixed network topology  [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Although some previous literatures studied the selection method of vaccinated nodes and explored the effect of vaccination strategy in adaptive networks  [26], the interplay between rewiring strategy and vaccination is less investigated.",

The nodes in the network can be divided into three states: susceptible state (S), infected state (I) and recovered state (R). Besides, contact weight is defined to measure the relation closeness level. The larger the weight is, the closer two individuals\u2019 relation is. Initially, a small part of nodes (I0) are randomly set to be infected and other nodes are susceptible. In each season, we assume that the probability of a susceptible individual getting infected through an SI link with unit weight (\u03c91) is \u03b2. So for any SI link with weight \u03c9, the infection probability is \u03b2(\u03c9)=1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b2)\u03c9/\u03c91. Without loss of generality, we set \u03c91=1 and have \u03b2(\u03c9)=1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b2)\u03c9. If a susceptible node i has |Bi| infected neighbors, the infected probability is \u03bb=1\u2212\u220fj\u2208Bi[1\u2212\u03b2(\u03c9ij)], where \u03c9ij is the link weight between node i and its infected neighbor j. In this paper, we investigate two types of weight distributions: uniform distribution (U(0, 2)) and normal distribution (N(1, 1/3))  [30]. At the same time, the probability that the infected individual becomes recovered is \u03bc. Once the infected node is recovered, it will not be infected again until next season.",

The impact of the link-breaking threshold on the epidemic size (R\u221e) and the fractions of six links (SS, SI, SR, II, RI and RR) are shown in Fig. 3\n. The term \u201cProportion of different links\u201d in Fig. 3 denotes proportion of six links with each \u03b8o. This term in other figures has the similar meaning. Clearly, the whole figure can be divided into three regions by two red dash lines based on the change of the epidemic size. In region I (\u03b8o lies in the interval \u223c[0,0.65]), the infection keeps in the high level as the increase of \u03b8o, which points out that breaking small weight links does not influence the epidemic size. It is consistent with the real contact network. The susceptible individuals seldom contact with infected nodes on the end of small weight links, so breaking those links hardly helps to control the disease spreading. The epidemic size becomes smaller and smaller when \u03b8o lies in the middle range (\u223c[0.65,0.9]). The disease can be controlled very well at \u03b8o=0.9. That is because, when \u03b8o increases, some large weight SI links are cut and those infected individuals are the ones that the susceptible often or inevitably contact with. But when \u03b8o>0.9 (region III), the epidemic size hardly changes. After breaking plenty of connections with the infected, SI links are sparse and infected individuals are relatively isolated, which cut off the disease spreading path. Thus the impact of the SI link removal process on lowering epidemic size gradually diminishes. Some previous literatures  [15], [27] mainly concluded that rewiring strategy can suppress the disease completely. However, different from these studies, our results exhibit that the rewiring strategy cannot always control the epidemic based on the above description. At the same time, there exist two critical points for \u03b8o (one is about \u03b8o1=0.65 and the other is about \u03b8o2=0.9), which can be treated as an important index for effective link removal. According to these critical points, Fig. 3 can be divided into two types of regions. In regions I and III, the epidemic size hardly changes as \u03b8o increases and these regions are defined as \u201cineffective region\u201d for controlling epidemic spreading. The region II, which can effectively lower the epidemic size, is called \u201ceffective region\u201d.",

That suggests that the disease spreads out more and more difficultly. Whereas when \u03b8o=0.95, the epidemic cannot outbreak. Besides, the proportion of RR links (red slash area) goes up with time, which demonstrates that R nodes are more inclined to be clustered. The cluster of R nodes also helps to control the disease propagation to some extent.

            "text": "With respect to link strength, disparate types of links play disparate roles in epidemic spreading  [34]. To further explain the above results, it is imperative to investigate the epidemic spreading when breaking the same number of SI links with different weight. E[\u03c91,\u03c92] is defined as the set of SI links with weight in the interval \u223c[\u03c91\u03c92]. Here we take lattice network with uniform distribution (U(0, 2)) as an example. In this type of weighted network, different weighted links are distributed uniformly in the network. The number of links in E[\u03c91,\u03c92] is approximately equal to that of E[\u03c93,\u03c94] (where \u03c92\u2212\u03c91=\u03c94\u2212\u03c93). Fig. 5\nshows the change of the density of recovered nodes (\u03c1R) with time when SI links in E[\u03c91,\u03c92] are removed. In Fig. 5, A, B and C represent the time that \u03c1R reaches the stable state when the SI links in the corresponding set are removed. For example, in the subpanel (a), the point A represents that in the time 350 \u03c1R reaches the stable state when the links in E[0.6,1] are removed. It is found that the value of \u03c1R in the stable state hardly changes as the increase of weight of removed SI links, which indicates that only breaking large weight links cannot lower the epidemic size (For instance, the stable values of \u03c1R in Fig. 5(a) are almost the same for three different scenarios). Moreover, when some large weight SI links are broken, it is more effective to slower the epidemic spreading, which can be exhibited from the time that \u03c1R tends to be stable (such as A, B and C in Fig. 5(a) and (b)). But the gap of three time points in Fig. 5(a) and (b) is small. Therefore, we just show two cases (E[0,1.2] and E[0.8,2.0]) in Fig. 5(c) and one side of weight intervals takes the extremum, which exhibit the different stable time of \u03c1R (A and C) more clearly. Comparing subpanels (a) and (b) in Fig. 5, we can find that breaking more SI links can slower the epidemic spreading more effective, because A corresponds to the time 350 and 400 in subpanels (a) and (b) respectively. We also find that when more weak links are broken, the stable time will be longer and the disease is suppressed more effectively. For instance, C in subpanel (a) is equivalent to the time 500, and C in subpanel (b) is equivalent to the time 600. Besides, when the set E[0.2,1.0] in subpanel (b) is expanded to E[0,1.2] in subpanel (c) from two sides or in other words more weak and strong links are removed, the effect of disease control is much better. Since the point A in subpanel (b) is approximately equal to the time 400, while A in subpanel (c) reaches to the time 500 and the difference can be exhibited more obviously from C in subpanels (b) and (c). The above results suggest that both small and large weight links (or we can treat them as weak and strong links) play important roles on epidemic spreading, which has been concluded by many previous literatures  [34], [35]. Based on previous studies, we try to show the disparity between strong links and weak links. The difference may be that strong links lead to high infection rate (infection rate \u03b2(\u03c9) increases with weight \u03c9) and contribute to the epidemic spreading, while the weak links mainly stabilize the network structure  [34], [35]. Therefore, when \u03b8o lies in the interval \u223c[0,0.65], rewiring strategy just destroys the stability of the network. As \u03b8o increases, rewiring strategy rapidly lowers susceptible individuals\u2019 infection rate by removing strong links, which results in disease control.",

Each subpanel in Fig. 7\nis associated with a given (v, e). As a result, the similar results like Fig. 3 come out, but there are some quantitative differences between the results. First, the epidemic size becomes small with the increase of initial vaccination rate (\u03c1V\u2032) in each subpanel. For example, when v=0.2 and e=0.2  (Fig. 7(a)), the blue triangle symbols (\u03c1V\u2032=0.08) is lower than the black square symbols (\u03c1V\u2032=0.02) as \u03b8o is small. Second, when v is fixed (such as v=0.2), the final recovered density (R\u221e) gradually reduces as vaccine effective rate (e) increases. The main reason resulting in the decline of epidemic size is that more rational individuals prefer to take high effective vaccine. Third, when v gets larger (from 0.2 to 0.8), less individuals incline to take vaccination and different initial vaccination rate (\u03c1V\u2032=0.2, 0.5, 0.8) leads to more similar epidemic size with small \u03b8o. Especially, when e=0.2 and \u03c1V\u2032=0.02 (the black square symbols in Fig. 7(a), (d), (g)), the disease can only be controlled to some extent even with high link-breaking threshold, especially when v=0.8. That is because, compared with expensive but low effective vaccine, most individuals prefer to low-cost strategy, namely, rewiring strategy. According to the above analysis, we can conclude that, without vaccination, the disease cannot be suppressed very well only through rewiring strategy, which implies that vaccination plays an important role on lowering the epidemic size.",

Therefore, incorporating human behavior into epidemiological models could improve models\u2019 utility in mimicking the reality and studying controlling measures  [45], [46], [47]. Meanwhile, such human behaviors influence the network topology and may significantly change the predicted course of epidemic dynamic. The adaptive network studied by many scholars depicts the impact of the dynamic change of network structure on epidemic spreading very well. However, most existing literatures of adaptive network ignore some important factors that generally exist in the social network, such as interpersonal relations. In this paper, considering individuals\u2019 contact relations, we proposed a new epidemic propagation model to study how the rewiring strategy affects the epidemic spreading. We divided our model into three processes, that is, epidemic spreading process, network evolution process and learning process. In the first process, a weighted SIR model was given to describe the epidemic propagation. In network evolution process, we introduced a new rewiring strategy which took individuals\u2019 relations into consideration. The link-breaking threshold parameter was given to describe the extent to which relation can be broken. Finally, susceptible individuals could evaluate their neighbors\u2019 payoffs and update their strategies in the last process. Fermi rule was introduced to calculate their learning probability.",

When \u03b8o is small, some weak links that susceptible individuals seldom connect with are removed, which does not influence the epidemic spreading. This is the reason why the infection remains at a high level. However, as the gradual increase of \u03b8o, rewiring strategy rapidly lowers susceptible individuals\u2019 infection rate by cutting strong links, which results in the decline of epidemic size. Besides, the importance of different types of links is also exhibited in our research. As well as strong links, weak links play an important role in the disease spreading.

Future work can study the influence of link-creating mechanism on the epidemic spreading. Finally, real data will be helpful to evaluate the correctness and generality of the proposed model.
