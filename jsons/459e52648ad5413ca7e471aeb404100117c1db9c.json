Previous investigation showed that there are 6 type of CoVs (hCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) which can infect the human species. HCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E belongs to alphaCoV genus while rest belongs to betaCoV genus. (Tang et al., 2015) . The betaCoVs appears to be prima-facie genre of CoVs which will peril universal human civilization in upcoming decades. Recently, the 2019-nCoV outbreak spread from China to the intercontinental arena and already infected 0.3 million people globally claiming ~13000 (~4.3%) deaths till 21 st March 2020 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). China and Italy were the epicentres until now and chances for more calamitous centres cannot be ruled out in near future. Genome sequence analysis of SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV confirmed its presence in betaCoVs family and divergence from the other two viruses (Zhu et al., 2020) . The 2019-nCoV is a positivestrand RNA viruses with ~29 Kb genome size, 125 nm in diameter and 6 to 11 open reading frames (ORFs) (Song et al., 2019) . Viral genome encodes for 4 major structural proteins namely envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M) and 3-5 nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genome starts with short untranslated regions (5' UTR) followed by genes 5\u2032-replicase (rep gene), S, E, M, N and 3' UTR (Song et al., 2019) . Two-third of the genome is represented by the rep gene at 5' end which encodes for non-structural protein (Nsp). Spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and corresponding viral entry into the host and hence important target for future drugs to restrict the viral titre (Du et al., 2009 (Du et al., , 2017 . Viral assembly relies primarily on M and E proteins and RNA synthesis is achieved by action of N protein (Song et al., 2019) .",

This indicates that most substitutions taking place were of synonymous type. Among various protein coding genes Nsp4-10, Nsp12-14, Nsp16, M, E and ORF6 shared highly conserve amino acid composition between bat-hCoV and hCoV with >99% similarity, especially Nsp7-10, Nsp16, E and ORF6 share 100% amino acid similarity ( Table 2 ). The 100% similarity in these regions across 591 hCoVs, bat and pangolin-hCoV mark them to be a probable target region for future antibodies and vaccine therapy. Notably, Nsp2 and Nsp14 region in hCoVs were most diversified in terms of nucleotide when compared to pangolin and bat-hCoV, whereas ORF10 and E regions were the least diverse (Table 2) .",

Group II comprises of the human 2019-nCoV mainly belonging to different province of China. However, few exceptions were also from South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Chile, USA, India, Belgium, Spain, Germany and France hCoVs. Group III mainly comprised of the hCoVs belonging to USA while Group IV represented the hCoVs of mixed type population belonging to several countries distributed over continents. Group V possess the hCoV from European countries along with few hCoVs of America and one from Taiwan. To understand mystery underlying the clustering pattern of the hCoVs, bat and pangolin-hCoV were used as a reference sequence to observe the nucleotide substitution in hCoV members in different groups. Interestingly, hCoV members (Group II and Group III) falling in proximity to Group I have less substitution in the genome sequences (Table   S2 ). The T:C (GroupV-hCoV:bat-hCoV and GroupV-hCoV:pangolin-hCoV) substitution were frequent in Group V as compared to hCoV representing other groups (Table S2 ) . The genomic signature of USA-hCoVs present in Group V is very different from USA-hCoVs of Group III.",

Spike region determines the specific binding to host receptor and initiation of viral replication. This region is reported to be the most potent and indispensable for viral attachment and entry into host system. The RRAR amino acids found only in the human CoVs spike region has proved to be essential for binding to host receptor (Walls et al., 2020) . We observed similar region in the hCoV genomes studied (23713-23724 region in nucleotide alignment), although there was mutation in two hCoV-England nucleotide sequences (CTCCGCGGCGGG in place of CTCCTCGGCGGG) but the resulting amino acid remained same in all hCoV genomes. These findings corroborate the essentiality of RRAR sequence for viral infection to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f host system. We found different type of mutation in hCoV spike protein at different places such as leucine to valine (L8V), glutamine to histidine (Q675H and also found in ORF3a:Q57H), glutamine to lysine (Q239K) and aspartate to glycine (D614G and also found in ORF5, D3G) might have potential role to augment viral infection (Table S3) . Previous investigations showed mutations such as leucine to valine change in retroviral envelope protein, glutamine to lysine in influenza virus, glutamine to histidine and aspartate to glycine in H1N1 had a severe impact in virus entry, replication and cross infectivity to other species (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2012; Glinsky, 2010; Yamada et al., 2010) .",

Change of isoleucine to valine in polymerase subunit PB2 of influenza virus resulted in critically enhanced activity of reconstituted polymerase complex (Rolling et al., 2009 ) and M to I substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase imparted resistance to nucleoside analog 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy-3\u2032thiacytidine (3TC) (Julias et al., 2004) . Interestingly, presence of a non-synonymous substitution in RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RDRP) region in majority of European hCoV samples resulted in change of amino acid from proline to leucine (P314L). It will be quite interesting to validate the effect of this substitution on RDRP activity as one of the previous study established that similar change of proline-to-leucine substitution (P236L) of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, imparts resistance against a highly specific inhibitor bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) (Fan et al., 1995) .

Few mutations also resulted in change of amino acid which may provide an explanation for failure of previously employed antiviral therapies. This research will better equip the researchers to utilize the mutated amino acid information for drug targets in particular geography and less cases of failure. Beside the substitution resulting into transformation to a more virulent strain there are number of highly conserved regions in the hCoV genome which can be used as target J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f for inhibitory drugs and vaccine development for a large repertoire of strains. Finally, we believe that our data provide useful information pertaining the changes in genomic and proteomic features which could serve as a guide to design the future antiviral therapies and diagnostics.",
