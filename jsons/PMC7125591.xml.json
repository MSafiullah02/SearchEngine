In a large multisite study of 2638 children hospitalized with CAP, 89% had radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Standard-of-care testing identified a viral infection in 66% of patients, a bacterial infection in 8% of patients, and both a viral and bacterial infection in 7% of patients (Jain et al., 2015). The current Pediatric CAP Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) recommend blood culture and viral testing for hospitalized patients with moderate to severe community-acquired or complicated pneumonia in order to identify a pathogen(s). Recommended empiric treatment include a third-generation cephalosporin for any patient with evidence of empyema, with the addition of vancomycin or clindamycin if there are clinical, laboratory, or imaging characteristics consistent with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Bradley et al., 2011) (MRSA) infection.",

Additionally, the clinical course of complicated pneumonias is often lengthy despite the presence of appropriate antimicrobial coverage (Breuer et al., 2018).

This culture yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae, and CFPNGS was also positive in this case. Pneumococci were identified in 8 additional cases only by CFPNGS (Fig. 1, Table 2). Respiratory cultures were obtained only in intubated children as endotracheal aspirates and yielded putative causal organisms in 33% of the study population (7 positive cultures from 5 patients). Of the respiratory samples, only 1 of the 3 patient cultures was concordant with the CFPNGS diagnostic test (patient 1 identified S. pneumoniae from the ETT and blood cultures as well as by CFPNGS). The 2 other patients with positive respiratory cultures were patient 10 (identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa from sputum and had negative CFPNGS) and patient 3 (isolated methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] from ETT culture and S. pneumoniae detected by CFPNGS). Three patients had negative respiratory cultures despite a positive CFPNGS test: patient 13 identified Fusobacterium nucleatum, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and Parviomonas micra detected on CFPNGS; patient 5 had S. pneumoniae detected; and patient 15 had Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinomyces graevenitzii, Veillonella dispar, and Actinomyces odontolyticus detected on CFPNGS. Seven patients did not have respiratory cultures obtained. Abscess fluid cultures obtained during placement of chest tube thoracostomies were positive in only 1 of 9 children: Patient 11 isolated Streptococcus intermedius from culture which was also detected by CFPNGS, CFPNGS also detected Aggregatibacter segnis and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Supplementary Table 1). A combination of conventional culture methods yielded a bacterial diagnosis in only 27% of children; with inclusion of PCR testing for viral etiologies, only 40% of children had an organism identified. Of note, the viral etiologies detected on a respiratory viral screen were not detected by CFPNGS due to the fact that RNA viruses are not detected this CFPNGS test. Patient 2 had coronavirus detected from a nasopharyngeal swab and S. pneumoniae by CFPNGS, and patient 1 had human metapneumovirus detected from a nasopharyngeal swab and S. pneumoniae from CFPNGS. Traditional testing yielded a result on average 31.4 h (range 2\u201342.8 h) after the sample was obtained, whereas CFPNGS yielded a result on average 98.1 h (range 48\u2013245.3 h) after the sample was obtained. The use of CFPNGS independently identified a plausible bacterial pathogen in 86% of children (13 of 15), with 60% (9 of 16) being positive for S. pneumoniae (Table 1).

Since the introduction of the 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV7), followed by PCV13, there has been a decrease in pediatric hospital admissions for pneumococcal pneumonia by 26\u201361%, but an increase in staphylococcal pneumonia and unspecified empyema by 1.89- to 4.08-fold (Grijalva et al., 2010). Although there is an increase in staphylococcal pneumonia, there may be a decrease in MRSA (Hult\u00e9n et al., 2018). Prior to the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the emergence of community-acquired MRSA, many physicians felt confident in the management of CAP based on a presumed diagnosis of pneumococcal or streptococcal pneumonia in children admitted with CAP. However, given the changing epidemiological landscape of pediatric CAP, many physicians are now less confident in the diagnosis of fully susceptible S. pneumoniae in the absence of a positive culture. Therefore, empiric antibiotic coverage has broadened to include both S. aureus and multidrug-resistant pneumococcus. A consensus guideline provided recommendations for the treatment of children with severe CAP (or complicated CAP), but a paucity of strong prospective data did not support a high level of evidence to tailor treatment for hospitalized children with culture-negative CAP (Fontela et al., 2017). Lastly, the high prevalence in CAP patients who had antibiotic exposure (53% in our cohort) prior to relevant culture samples, including blood cultures, further reduces the sensitivity of cultures for pathogen detection using conventional methods. The use of CFPNGS has helped address this issue by identifying the infectious etiology in children, even when standard microbiologic cultures are negative. However, the lack of rigorous data regarding sensitivity and specificity of CFPNGS has left clinicians with minimal information in determining who would benefit from CFPNGS.",

            "text": "Similar to previous studies (Lin et al., 2013, Krenke et al., 2016), we found the yield of blood cultures and pleural effusion cultures to be low, possibly secondary to antibiotic pretreatment. It is interesting to note that there was not complete concordance between CFPNGS and traditional culture/viral PCR (see Table 2). This is an important challenge for the application of a novel technology. Since this CFPNGS test does not detect RNA viruses, there was not concordance with CFPNGS and respiratory PCR testing. Also, local sampling in traditional ETT cultures could explain why only 1 of 3 respiratory cultures were in agreement with the CFPNGS since the respiratory sample was collected from the upper airway and may not represent infection in the lung. Based upon the detection of an organism (often Streptococcus pneumoniae) consistent with the clinical presentation and with the site of infection in an area of high blood flow (the lung) leading to increased shedding of pathogen DNA into the blood, it seems reasonable to suggest that CFPNGS may better reflect the nature of a pulmonary infection than a sample obtained from the upper airway. Further rigorous studies are required to delineate the accuracy of CFPNGS versus traditional cultures. CFPNGS may also present a challenge for infectious disease specialists as organisms that are not common pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra and Veillonella dispar, are identified in critically ill patients in combination with other potentially pathogenic bacteria or in isolation. Does this CFPNGS signal suggest co-infection, bacterial presence in another part of the body (e.g., oral flora from a patient with gingivitis), or pathogenicity that is perhaps more common than we had previously thought? As this technology becomes more broadly accepted, many of these questions will have to be carefully examined.",

Importantly, none of the children treated with narrowed antimicrobial therapy based on CFPNGS results were readmitted for late complications of CAP that could be attributed to inappropriate antibiotic therapy.

First, the study is limited in scope given the small patient numbers and the uncontrolled nature of the decision to consult the infectious diseases service and to have the consultant order the CFPNGS test, although these data reflect a real-world experience. Children with CAP selected for CFPNGS evaluation represented a more severely ill patient population, as demonstrated by a high rate of PICU admission, prolonged hospitalization, and the predominance of complicated CAP with empyema and/or parapneumonic effusion. The average time to CFPNGS result was 4 days, although it is possible that this time may decrease as efficiencies in transport, processing, and analysis improve. Overall, these data suggest that CFPNGS in conjunction with standard culture techniques may significantly increase diagnostic yield and facilitate antibiotic selection in severe CAP.",
