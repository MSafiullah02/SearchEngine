Nuclear chaperones serve to ensure proper assembly of nucleosomes and proper formation of higher order structures of chromatin. In fact, this family of proteins has such diverse functions in cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling, ribosome biogenesis, genome stability, centrosome replication, and transcriptional regulation. Of the members of this family, NPM1 is the most studied because it is often altered in expression levels in tumors and mutated/translocated in hematological malignancies (Grisendi et al. 2006) . It is the main focus of this review. NPM2 and NPM3 are less well characterized, and are also discussed wherever appropriate. Invertebrate NPM-like proteins are not discussed in this review.",

Transcript variant 1 is ubiquitously expressed and is the major and the longest transcript, giving rise to isoform 1 of 294 amino acids. Transcript variant 2 skips an in-frame exon (exon 8) and produces a shorter protein (isoform 2) of 265 amino acids, whose functions and expression pattern are not known. Transcript variant 3 utilizes an alternate 3\u00a2 exon (exon 10) and hence produces a 259-amino-acid protein with a C-terminus different from that of isoform 1. The corresponding isoforms 1 and 3 in rat are B23.1 and B23.2, and have different subcellular distribution patterns . Isoform 1 is localized in the nucleolus (Michalik et al. 1981; Spector et al. 1984) while isoform 3 is found in the nucleoplasm with low expression levels (Dalenc et al. 2002) .",

This region can also interact with core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 to function as a histone chaperone and facilitate nucleosome assembly (Okuwaki et al. 2001b) .

The core region forms a tight pentameric assembly through hydrophobic interactions between the monomeric subunits ( Fig. 10.2b) . Moreover, in the crystallization environment, two pentameric complexes align along their fivefold symmetry axis and associate in head-to-head fashion to form a decameric assembly ( Fig. 10 .2c). The monomeric and pentameric structures of human NPM1 core domain are highly similar to that of the core region (c) Structure of the core region in decameric assembly as observed in crystal lattice. The histone-octamer is modeled to contact the lateral surface of NPM1 decameric ring to form the NPM-histone complex. The dotted lines indicate highly flexible and disordered loops. (d) Comparison of human NPM1 decameric complex (colored blue) with that of Xenopus npm1 (colored magenta). The two structures are aligned by superposing on the top pentamer of the decameric ring (left), and the rotational shift for the bottom pentamer as a result of such alignment is illustrated with an arrow (right). The structural files for the N-terminal pentameric domain of human NPM1 (PDB ID 2P1B; Lee et al. 2007) and Xenopus npm1 (PDB ID 1XE0; Namboodiri et al. 2004 ) are downloaded from the public database RCSB Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org), and the figures are prepared using the program CCP4mg (Potterton et al. 2004) of several other NPM proteins including the Xenopus NO38 (i.e., npm1) (Namboodiri et al. 2004) , the Xenopus nucleoplasmin (i.e., npm2) (Dutta et al. 2001) , and the Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein (i.e., dNPL) (Namboodiri et al. 2003) . All these structures share the same b-sandwich fold with root mean square deviation of ~1.0 \u00c5 for the Ca atoms . Such an oligomeric assembly observed in crystal structures agrees with previous findings that NPM proteins have a propensity to oligomerize with the benefit of enhanced thermostability Herrera et al. 1996) . A structure-based model of the NPM-histone complex, mainly based on the structures of the Xenopus NO38 and nucleoplasmin core domain, was proposed to consist of the NPM decamer and the histone octamer, with either the H2A-H2B dimer or the H3-H4 tetramer contacting the NPM core on the lateral surface of the decameric ring ( Fig. 10 .2c) (Dutta et al. 2001; Namboodiri et al. 2004 ). However, many details of this modeled oligomeric assembly still await further clarification.",

When the decameric structure of human NPM1 core region is superimposed onto that of Xenopus NO38 by aligning one of the pentamers (referred to as the top one), the other pentamer (referred to as the bottom one) in the decameric assembly shows a large rotational offset (~20\u00b0) from that of Xenopus npm1 core ( Fig. 10 .2d) and a relative smaller rotational offset (~10\u00b0) from that of Xenopus npm2 core ). Such rotational offset does not change the pattern of which monomer of the top pentamer contacts the corresponding monomer of the bottom pentamer, but it does lead to different sets of polar interactions between these monomers to stabilize the pentamer-pentamer interface ). In addition, the molecular composition of the lateral surface for the NPM decamer assembly would be affected by such rotational offset as well. This structural plasticity is likely due to the small interface area between the pentamers (~560 \u00c5 2 ) and the limited number of residues directly involved in polar interactions at the interface ). The differences in the decameric assembly of human and Xenopus NPM proteins could have a significant implication for their respective histone chaperone function because the histones were proposed in the above-mentioned structural model to contact the lateral surface of the decameric assembly. Indeed, some substrate preferences toward the various core histone proteins have been observed for NPM proteins, with Xenopus npm1 showing preference for the H3-H4 tetramers and the Xenopus npm2 preferring the H2A-H2B dimers (Dutta et al. 2001; Namboodiri et al. 2003) .",

The first motif (residues 42-47) is located on the b3 strand forming part of inter-subunit interface within the pentameric ring ( Fig. 10.2a) . Mutation of two conserved leucine residues in this sequence motif (Leu42Ala and Leu44Ala) leads to a defective NPM1 that cannot be shuttled out of nucleus (Maggi et al. 2008) . Such defect inhibits the nuclear export of both the 40S and 60S ribosomal units, which associate with NPM1 and depend on the shuttling of NPM1 for their export (Maggi et al. 2008) . Thus, for this shuttling-defective NPM1 mutant, the available pool of cytoplasmic ribosome units would be reduced and the overall protein synthesis diminished, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation. The second NES motif (residues 94-102) is located on the b7 strand on the outer lateral surface of the pentameric ring. This motif leads to nuclear export of NPM1 by the Ran-Crm1 complex, and enables the association of NPM1 with the centrosome during mitosis to prevent centrosome reduplication . Removal of this NES motif by deleting residues 94-102 or mutating two conserved leucine residues (Leu100Ala and Leu102Ala) leads to nuclear retention of NPM1 and supernumerary centrosomes ).",

Dictated by the many acidic aspartate and glutamate residues, the distinct electrostatic property of this region suggests that it can possibly be engaged in interaction with basic proteins such as histones and sperm basic proteins to facilitate nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling. Indeed, the acidic stretch A1 was found to be critical for the histone chaperone activity of NPM1. While an NPM1 construct encompassing both the pentameric core domain and the acidic stretch A1 shows ~97% chaperone activity, the pentameric domain alone shows only 30% chaperone activity and may be incapable of assembling nucleosomes (Hingorani et al. 2000) . In the proposed model of NPM-histone complex mentioned above, the acidic stretch A1 was included as a critical element to bind to histone proteins and facilitate the assembly of the NPMhistone complex ( Fig. 10 .2c) (Dutta et al. 2001; Namboodiri et al. 2004 ). This acidic region is also found to be critical for NPM1-mediated viral replication (see Sect. 10.6.1). One study showed that both acidic stretches A1 and A2 are critical for promoting in vitro replication of adenovirus DNA complexed with viral basic core proteins by mediating direct interaction between NPM1 and the viral basic proteins to enable them to serve as molecular chaperones and to facilitate the transfer of viral DNA onto these basic proteins (Okuwaki et al. 2001a; Samad et al. 2007) . Similarly, another study demonstrated that the human hepatitis delta virus antigen molecules (HDVAgs) interact with NPM1 to up-regulate NPM1 expression and enhance viral replication (Huang et al. 2001) . In vitro and in vivo studies mapped this NPM1-HDVAgs interaction to the N-terminal basic region of HDVAgs and the acidic stretch A1, probably because of their electrostatic complementarity (Huang et al. 2001) . Lastly, the acidic region in general has been speculated to contribute to the relatively high affinity of NPM1 for peptides containing sequences of NLSs of the SV40 T-antigen type, such as the HIV Rev protein to stimulate its nuclear import and viral replication (Szebeni et al. 1997 ).",

Moreover, this binding activity would be beneficial to the functional role of NPM1 in ribosomal biogenesis because NPM1 should recognize and associate with preribosomal particles to transport them from nucleus to cytoplasm. In fact, NPM1 has been found to interact with rRNA and several ribonuclear proteins in the 40S and 60S ribosome units Maggi et al. 2008) . This basic region also mediates the interaction of NPM1 with tumor suppressor p53. The NPM1-p53 interaction leads to enhanced stability of p53 and up-regulation of its tumor suppression function (Colombo et al. 2002) .",

Several well-conserved aromatic residues, including Trp288 and Trp290, are found to form a hydrophobic core and are critical to the structural folding of this domain. Mutation of these tryptophan residues to alanine results in collapse of the structure and loss of nucleolar localization (Grummitt et al. 2008 ). This result indicates that the structural integrity of this domain is critical to its nucleolar localization. Several surface lysine residues (Lys248, Lys263, and Lys267) have also been found to be critical to nucleolar localization of NPM1 although they are not critical to the structural integrity of this domain. Thus, these lysine residues could serve a functional, instead of a structural, role for nucleolar localization of NPM1.",

These features include the abundant NPM1 localization in nucleolus and the ability to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm to bind nucleic acids and to transport preribosomal particles (Borer et al. 1989; Yun et al. 2003; Wang et al. 1994; Dumbar et al. 1989; Prestayko et al. 1974; Olson et al. 1986 ). In fact, NPM1 has been found to have intrinsic ribonuclease activity and be able to process preribosomal RNA in the internal transcribed spacer sequence (Savkur and Olson 1998; Herrera et al. 1995) . This ribonuclease-mediated processing of ribosomal RNA is facilitated necessarily by the chaperone property of NPM1, which is important in preventing the aggregation of proteins in nucleolus during the process of ribosomal assembly. This proposition is supported by the finding that knockdown of NPM1 changes the ribosome profile and suppression of NPM1 inhibits the processing of preribosomal RNA (Grisendi et al. 2005; Itahana et al. 2003) . One of the common morphological features of tumor cells is the enlarged nucleoli. This observation is conceivably linked to the proposed oncogenic role of NPM1 because the frequently observed aberrantly high NPM1 expression in rapidly proliferating tumor cells is generally consistent with the rapid ribosome biogenesis in maintaining the proliferative potential of tumor cells (Ruggero and Pandolfi 2003) .",

These findings illustrate the difference of the survival time between NPM1-deficient and pescadillo-deficient embryos and raise the question whether NPM1 might not be an essential protein in the process of ribosomal biogenesis.

NPM1 is able to form a stable complex with YY1 and, interestingly, the transcriptional repressive function of YY1 can be relieved by the interaction with NPM1 (Inouye and Seto 1994) . NPM1 can also modulate the binding of NFkB, E2F1, and pRB for the activation of E2F1 promoter .",

In retinoic acid-induced differentiation in human leukemia HL-60 cells, a decline in c-myc, NPM1, and its promoter activity is observed (Yung 2004) . The transcriptional mechanism underlying the down-regulation of NPM1 during retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation involves dynamic changes in the promoter occupancy of different transcriptional regulators and these include NPM1 and AP2a (Liu et al. 2007a) . It is intriguing that NPM1 is demonstrated to be recruited by AP2a to the promoters of some retinoic acid-responsive genes such as b-Myb, HSP60, and p120. These findings illustrate that NPM1 might be able to serve as a negative coregulator during retinoic acid signaling-induced gene expression. All these data indicate the potential important function of NPM1 as a molecular regulator of gene expression at the transcriptional level. By examining the U1 bladder cancer U4 premalignant cells, the intimate relationship of NPM1 with Ras and c-Myc has been further demonstrated in proliferation of cells associated with a high degree of malignancy ).",

            "text": "Overexpression of NPM1 can promote cell survival and this is accomplished partly through the inhibition of apoptosis (Ye 2005) . Several pieces of evidenc support the anti-apoptotic role of NPM1. First of all, the oncogenic role of NPM1 hinges on its ability in inhibiting apoptosis in response to hypoxia . As NPM1 is a transcriptional target of hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), it has been reported that aberrantly increased expression of NPM1 might result in inhibition of the activation of tumor suppressor p53 and thus dampen p53-mediated activation of apoptosis during hypoxia-driven tumor progression . Second, overexpression of NPM1 has been shown to induce resistance to ultraviolet irradiationinduced apoptosis, which is mediated by the tumor suppressor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1, a transcription factor involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest) in NIH-3 T3 fibroblast cells (Wu et al. 2002b; Kondo et al. 1997) . Third, as demonstrated in hematopoietic cells, overexpression of NPM1 has been shown to be related to the suppression of the activation of interferon-inducible, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), which normally induces apoptosis (Pang et al. 2003; Jagus et al. 1999) . This observation has been associated with the aberrant proliferation of tumor cells. Fourth, NPM1 is shown to have a functional role as the receptor for second messenger phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate (PIP3) in nucleus and this NPM1-PIP3 complex is a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase. The formation of nuclear NPM1-PIP3 complex has been shown to suppress apoptosis by inhibiting the DNA fragmentation activity of the pro-apoptotic factor caspase-activated DNase in PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor (Ahn et al. 2005) . Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic function of NPM1 has been related to its inhibitory effect on tumor suppressor p53. NPM1 interacts with p53 in hypoxic cells to hinder the hypoxia-induced activation of p53 phosphorylation ). There is evidence that NPM1 might inhibit the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and thus abrogate the induction of p21 (Li et al. 2005) . Last but not least, NPM1 interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein GADD45a, which is responsive to genotoxic stress. While GADD45a lacks a classical NLS, NPM1 has been shown to serve as the molecular chaperone for GADD45a in controlling its subcellular distribution. Most importantly, disruption of NPM1-GADD45a complex has been found to impair the cell cycle arrest and apoptotic functions of GADD45a .",

NPM1 is decreased via down-regulated transcriptional process during the BuONa/vanadate-induced apoptosis. As no decrease in NPM1 mRNA and the telomerase activities is observed during the growth arrest by serum-starvation, the decrease in NPM1 mRNA expression and telomerase activity in HL-60 cells subsequent to BuONa/vanadate treatment is suggested to be attributed to cellular apoptosis rather than the growth arrest induced by BuONa/vanadate.

NPM1 is found to translocate to the chromosome periphery and the cytoplasmic entities called nucleolus-derived foci (NDF) (Dundr et al. 2000) . It then redistributes to the poles of the mitotic spindle to interact with a nuclear matrix protein called NuMA to control the formation of centrosomes in prometaphase and mitotic poles in metaphase (Compton and Cleveland 1994; Zatsepina et al. 1999) . The consistent observation that NPM1 is present at the mitotic spindle poles suggests the protective role of NPM1 in preventing hyper-amplification of centrosome to ensure successful progression through G2-M phases (Tokuyama et al. 2001; Zatsepina et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2004) . Indeed, NPM1 is not classified as a centrosomal protein but it has been proposed to be involved in the duplication of centrosomes. This is supported by the data that NPM1 is associated specifically with the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation, which facilitates centrosome duplication (Okuda 2002; Tokuyama et al. 2001; Andersen et al. 2003) .",

Moreover, the expression level of NPM3 has been shown to be correlated with the process of decondensation of paternal chromosome after fertilization (McLay and Clarke 2003) . Intriguingly, NPM3 has also been found to be associated with the histone tail peptides and serves as a histone-binding protein in mouse embryonic stem cells (Motoi et al. 2008) . Thus, NPM3 is believed to be a chromatin-remodeling protein responsible for the unique chromatin structure and replicative capacity of embryonic stem cells. Recently, NPM3 was shown to interact with all the individual core histones and was able to enhance transcription via the modulation of the histone chaperone activities of its interacting partner NPM1 in vitro (Gadad et al. 2010 ).",

Phosphorylation of NPM1 by cyclin E/cdk2 during G1 phase has been documented and this may be related to the initiation of centrosome duplication by dissociating NPM1 from centriole (Tarapore et al. 2006; Tokuyama et al. 2001) . The RNA-binding activity of NPM1 is diminished after cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of Thr199 of NPM1 during mitosis, and this is suggested to link to the disassembly of nucleolus by disrupting the RNA-protein binding interaction of NPM1 (Hisaoka et al. 2010; Okuwaki et al. 2002) . Phosphorylation of Thr199 has also been implicated in inhibiting GCN5-mediated histone acetylation (Zou et al. 2008) . During mitosis, NPM1 is found to be phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which might be an important event in mediating mitosis . During interphase, NPM1 has also been reported to be phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) and this is thought to have a role in regulating the nucleolar structure by modulating the dynamic localization of NPM1 between nucleolus and nucleoplasm (Szebeni et al. 2003; Negi and Olson 2006) . Dephosphorylation can be another mechanism in regulating the functions of NPM1. A serine/threonine protein phosphatase called PP1b has been shown to dephosphorylate NPM1 in response to DNA damage during ultraviolet irradiation and this process is suggested to facilitate the DNA repair process (Lin et al. 2010) .",

While histone acetyltransferase p300 activates transcription by acetylating the histones and \"loosening\" the tightly packed chromatin structure, the p300 enzyme also leads to acetylation of NPM1. Such acetylation potentiates the activating effect of p300 on transcription activation by ~fourfold. In vitro experiments have mapped the acetylation sites of NPM1 mostly to the C-terminal region (Lys212, Lys229, Lys230, Lys248 or Lys250, Lys257 and Lys292), which need to be confirmed by further in vivo experiments.",

NPM1 has been shown to be the ubiquitination substrate of BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase, but intriguingly the product is not targeted for proteasome-dependent protein degradation unless destabilized by tumor suppressor ARF (Sato et al. 2004; Itahana et al. 2003) . Sumoylation is shown to be another mechanism that can modulate the activities of NPM1.

The activity of NPM2 that binds and removes sperm basic proteins, and replaces them with histones has been found to depend on the massive hyperphosphorylation of NPM2 that occurs when oocytes mature into eggs (Leno et al. 1996) . The hyperphosphorylation of NPM2 is proposed to modulate the rapid changes in chromatin structure that accompany early development in Xenopus. The function of NPM2 to exchange the H2A-H2B heterodimers for sperm-specific proteins is shown to be mediated by adding 14-20 phosphates to each NPM2 monomer (Cotten et al. 1986 ).",

Another main effect of NPM1 overexpression is the inhibition of apoptosis (see Sect. 10.4.4) via several different pathways (Grisendi et al. 2006; Ye 2005) . As such, NPM1 has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Indeed, NPM1 is overexpressed in many tumors of different origins (Table 10 .2): gastric (Tanaka et al. 1992) , colon (Nozawa et al. 1996) , liver (Yun et al. 2007 ), breast (Skaar et al. 1998 ), ovarian (Shields et al. 1997) , prostate (L\u00e9otoing et al. 2008; Subong et al. 1999) , bladder (Tsui et al. 2004) , thyroid (Pianta et al. 2010 ), brain (Gimenez et al. 2010) , and multiple myeloma (Weinhold et al. 2010 ). In particular, NPM1 overexpression may be correlated with clinical features in some cases. Overexpression of NPM1 in hepatocellular carcinoma was found to be correlated with clinical prognostic parameters such as serum alpha fetal protein level, tumor pathological grading, and liver cirrhosis (Yun et al. 2007 ) -suggesting the potential of NPM1 overexpression as a marker of hepatocellular carcinoma. NPM1 overexpression was associated with recurrence and progression of bladder cancer (Tsui et al. 2004) . Overall, the observation that NPM1 overexpression promotes tumor development tends to suggest its role as a proto-oncogene.",

(2005) that aberrant cytoplasmic localization (instead of nucleolar) of the NPM1 protein (NPMc+) in leukemic blast cells was due to frameshift mutations in exon 12 of the NPM1 gene in patients with AML carrying a normal karyotype. NPMc+ AML accounts for ~30% of all cases of adult AML, or ~60% of all cases of adult AML with normal karyotype (Falini et al. 2007b; Rau and Brown 2009 ). The significance of the finding is that NPMc+ due to NPM1 frameshift mutations is the single most common somatic mutation in adult AML. Of note is the less frequent occurrence (~7%) of NPMc+ in AML in children (Falini et al. 2007b; Rau and Brown 2009 ). This difference may reflect the difference in molecular pathogenesis of AML carrying normal karyotype in adults and children.",

About 50% of the mutations are 4-base insertions between the second and the third base of the Trp288 codon (TG^G). About 20% of the mutations are insertions of 4-14 bases between Gln289 and Trp290 codons (CAG^TGG). Another 20% are insertions of 8-12 bases between the first and the second base of Trp290 codon (T^GG) followed by deletions of 2-5 bases. All these mutations produce a shift in the reading frame of the transcript from the point of insertion or deletion. Many more mutations are expected to be discovered. However, the most common mutation is a duplication (a type of insertion) of a 4-base sequence TCTG at positions 956-959 of the reference sequence (NM_002520 ,  Table 10 .1), and accounts for 70-80% of adult NPMc+ AML. This was designated as mutation A by Falini et al. (2005) . About 15% of adult NPMc+ AML cases are due to mutations B (CATG insertion) or D (CCTG insertion) at the same position.",

The first critical alteration is the loss of Trp288 and Trp290 residues or just Trp290 alone, which are essential to the nucleolar localization of the wildtype NPM1 (Nishimura et al. 2002) . Loss of these tryptophan residues disrupts the triple helix structure of the NPM1 C-terminal domain (Fig. 10.3 ; see Sect. 10.3.4) and thus greatly reduces the NPM1 localization in the nucleolus (Grummitt et al. 2008 ).",

There is a strong correlation between the loss of one or two tryptophan residues and the type of new NES motif generated at the C-terminus. Loss of both tryptophan residues is always found with the common NES motif Leu-xxx-Val-xx-Val-x-Leu, where x is any amino acid. On the contrary, loss of Trp290 alone is always found with the much less frequent variant NES motif Leu-Trp xx-X-xx-Val-x-Leu, where X replaces the Val residue and can be leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, or cysteine (Rau and Brown 2009 ). Experimentally, the variant NES motifs were found to provide a much stronger force than the common NES motif in driving the Trp288-containing mutated NPM1 from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm . Tested with the same experimental system, the physiological N-terminal NES motifs were found to be weak in transporting the wildtype NPM1 protein to the cytoplasm, and this explains the dominant localization of the wildtype NPM1 protein in the nucleolus. The artificial combination of a common weak C-terminal NES motif with a Trp288containing NPM1 mutant localized the mutated protein mainly in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus with much less export to the cytoplasm. Intriguingly, a weak C-terminal NES motif together the retention of the Trp288 residue has never been detected in any primary AML samples. Therefore, this strongly suggests that cytoplasmic mislocalization of the mutated NPM1 protein is critical to the development of AML .",

Intriguingly, mutated NPM1 protein may still be able to interact with other nuclear proteins that interact with the wildtype NPM1 protein in normal cells, and dislocate them to the cytoplasm. Indeed, at least four such nucleolar/nuclear interacting partners have been found to interact with the mutated NPM1 protein, be dislocated to the cytoplasm, and hence have their physiological functions abrogated: mouse p19Arf and human p14ARF (den Besten et al. 2005; Colombo et al. 2006; Bolli et al. 2009 ), hexamethylene bis-acetamide-inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) (Gurumurthy et al. 2008) , the F-box protein Fbw7g (Bonetti et al. 2008) , and Miz1 (Wanzel et al. 2008) . Attenuation of the functions of these interacting proteins are suggested to contribute to the oncogenic effect of NPMc+, as briefly explained below one by one. First, ARF is a well-known tumor suppressor and is stabilized by wildtype NPM1 protein in the nucleolus (Gallagher et al. 2006; Sherr 2006) . In vitro experiments have shown that mutated NPM1 protein can interact directly with ARF and shuttle it to the cytoplasm, but cannot protect it from degradation (den Besten et al. 2005; Colombo et al. 2006) . Second, HEXIM1 is an inhibitor of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is itself an important transcriptional regulator of the enzyme RNA polymerase II (Dey et al. 2007 ). Wildtype NPM1 negatively regulates HEXIM1 via proteasome-mediated degradation while mutated NPM1 associates with and shuttles HEXIM1 to the cytoplasm and hence promotes P-TEFb-mediated transcription in the nucleus (Gurumurthy et al. 2008 ).",

Wildtype NPM1 protein localizes and stabilizes Fbw7g in the nucleolus, and hence regulates the turnover of c-Myc (Bonetti et al. 2008) . Mutated NPM1 protein interacts with Fbw7g and dislocates it to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded. As a result, c-Myc is stabilized -a situation that reflects the oncogenic potential of NPMc+ (Bonetti et al. 2008) . Fourth, Miz1 is a Mycassociated zinc-finger protein and, when bound to Myc, enables Myc to suppress transcription of the genes encoding the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b and p21Cip1 (Adhikary and Eilers 2005) . Wildtype NPM1 localizes Miz1 to the nucleolus and is an essential coactivator of Miz1. However, mutated NPM1 protein re-directs Miz1 to the cytoplasm and exhibits dominant-negative effect on Miz1 (Wanzel et al. 2008) . Thus, disruption of Miz1 function may contribute to the transforming potential of NPMc+.",

In transgenic mice expressing human NPMc+ under the influence of a myeloid-specific promoter, expansion of myeloid cells is noted in bone marrow and spleen (Cheng et al. 2010 ).

Clonal NPM1 mutations are found in myeloid, monocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cells, but not in fibroblasts and endothelial cells ). In addition, two or more myeloid hemopoietic cell lineages are affected in about 62% of NPMc+ AML cases while the remaining 38% involve only one myeloid cell lineage ).

The surface marker CD34 is typically present on hematopoietic stem cells. This raises the question whether the NPM1 mutation arises in a CD34\u2212 multipotent hemotapoietic progenitor (Engelhardt et al. 2002) or whether there exists a small pool of CD34+/CD38\u2212 NPM1-mutated progenitor. CD34+/CD38\u2212 cells usually contain the leukemia stem cells that are capable of propagating and maintaining the leukemia phenotype in immuocompromised mice (Estrov 2010) . Indeed, CD34+ cells from NPMc+ AML carry the NPM1 mutation and, when transplanted into immunocompromised mice, generate a leukemia phenotype that is the same as the original patient's disease in all aspects (Martelli et al. 2010 ). On the other hand, the evidence for the engraftment capability of CD34\u2212 cells from NPMc+ AML is less consistent (Martelli et al. 2010; Taussig et al. 2010) .

            "text": "The NPM1 gene at chromosome 5q35 is translocated in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and in rare variants of AML. Translocation produces an oncogenic fusion protein and a reduced level of the wildtype NPM1 protein encoded by the remaining copy of the functional allele (heterozygosity). The fusion protein is made up of the N-terminus of the NPM1 protein and the C-terminus of the partner protein encoded by the other gene involved in the translocation. The role of the NPM1 moiety in these fusion proteins has not been fully elucidated although it may just serve to promote heterodimer formation, and hence shuttle the fusion protein to the nucleus. ALCL is a T-cell lymphoma characterized by CD30 expression (Falini 2001; Falini et al. 2007b) . It accounts for ~3% of adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 10-30% of childhood lymphoma. About 60% of ALCL cases express the tyrosine kinase gene ALK (anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase) and are known as ALK+ ALCL. In general, ALK+ ALCL show good response to induction therapy and has good prognosis. The majority (~85%) of such cases carry the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosome translocation, which joins the NPM1 gene on 5q35 with the ALK gene on 2p23 to produce the chimeric gene NPM1-ALK and hence the fusion protein. The remaining 15% are heterogeneous at the molecular level because the translocations involve other chromosomal partners. The NPM1-ALK fusion protein consists of the N-terminal part of the NPM1 protein (the first 116 amino acids; carrying the oligomerization domain) and the entire cytoplasmic domain of the ALK protein (the last 563 amino acids; carrying the catalytic domain). Through the oligomerization domain, the NPM1-ALK fusion proteins form homodimers with each other, and heterodimers with the wildtype NPM1 protein. Because of the NPM1 promoter, the fusion protein is ectopically expressed in lymphoid cells and the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase domain is thought to contribute to the tumor formation. The fusion protein is expressed in the cytoplasm as expected but is also unexpectedly localized in the nucleus because of the shuttling of the heterodimers composed of the fusion protein and the wildtype NPM1, which still possesses the nucleus localization signal and hence imports the heterodimers into the nucleus.",

            "text": "The role of NPM1 in transporting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proteins to nucleolus is well-documented. HIV is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and possesses two identical copies of positivesense RNA genomes. Replication of HIV-1 is a complicated process and involves both nucleus and cytoplasm. During replication, the RNA genome is being reversetranscribed into DNA in the cytoplasm and transported to the nucleus, where the DNA is transcribed into mRNA and the latter then returns to the cytoplasm for subsequent translation. The HIV-1 regulatory protein Rev is involved in the export of partially spliced or unspliced mRNA from the nucleus (Perkins et al. 1989 ). As Rev is localized in the nucleolus, it was speculated that certain host factors would be involved in the transportation of Rev in and out of the nucleolus. Using affinity chromato graphy, Fankhauser et al. (1991) confirmed the participation of NPM1 in the transit of Rev between cytoplasm and nucleus, which allowed for further rounds of export of HIV-1 mRNA. Apart from Rev, NPM1 also localizes the HIV Tat protein into nucleolus (Li 1997) , where Tat will recruit cellular cofactor (positive transcription elongation factor b or P-TEFb) and transactivate proviral DNA transcription. This process is critical for HIV replication. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) can cause acute encephalitis in humans. It belongs to the same Flaviviridae family as hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is transmitted among mosquitoes and pigs, and transmission to humans may occur when the number of infected mosquito vectors increases to a very high level. The RNA genome encodes the envelope, structural proteins, as well as core and the nonstructural proteins. Similar to HCV and other flaviviridae, JEV core protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Bulich and Aaskov 1992; Tsuda et al. 2006 ). According to mutation and animal inoculation studies, localization of core protein in the nucleus is crucial to the replication of JEV (Mori et al. 2005) . During JEV infection, amino acids Gly42 and Pro43 of the JEV core protein interact with the N-terminal region of NPM1, and this interaction results in transportation of the viral core protein into the nucleus (Tsuda et al. 2006) . Both chaperone and RNA binding activities of NPM1 are important for JEV replication. Besides, dislocation of NPM1 from nucleus to cytoplasm has also been noted. Although the precise mechanism is not well-defined, it is possible that NPM1 is retained in the cytoplasm by JEV-induced cytoplasmic factors or NPM1 is released into the cytoplasm on disruption of nuclear organization (Tsuda et al. 2006) .",

Patients with chronic HBV infection and superinfected with HDV can suffer from much more severe complications such as fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The virus possesses an RNA genome and HDVAg in two isoforms; the small form is involved in HDV RNA replication and the large form in virus assembly (Casey 2006) . Replication of HDV occurs in the nucleolus, and NPM1 interacts with HDV antigens and modulates viral RNA replication (Huang et al. 2001; Li et al. 2006) . During HDV infection, NPM1 is up-regulated and interacts with the small and the large form (to a lesser extent) of HDVAg. The interaction domains of NPM1-HDVAg are within the NLS of HDVAg and NPM1 acts as a shuttle protein for transportation of HDVAg into the nucleus. Apart from this, NPM1 also plays a role in HDV RNA replication. Huang et al. (2001) demonstrated that exogenous NPM1 had stimulatory effect on HDV RNA replication, while deleting the HDV binding site in NPM1 impaired this effect. Besides, they also observed colocalization of the small HDVAg with NPM1 and nucleolin in the nucleolus. As nucleolin can serve as a transcriptional factor (Yang et al. 1994) , this may in turn confer a regulatory role for HDVAg on HDV RNA replication.",

Replication of the viral genome relies on three early proteins, namely, the viral polymerase (Adpol); preterminal protein (pTP), which primes DNA synthesis (Liu et al. 2003) ; and DNA-binding protein (DBP), which initiates DNA replication (de Jong et al. 2003) . Two NPM1 isoforms are involved in adenovirus DNA replication (Hindley et al. 2007) . During viral genome replication, NPM1.1 and NPM1.3 interact differently with the viral early proteins pTP and DBP, and NPM1.3 is initially localized in the DBP/viral DNA-rich regions. Once the viral pTP expression increases, NPM1.1 is localized in the pTP-rich regions and interacts with pTP. This is followed by recruiting NPM1.3 into the pTP-rich regions and interaction with the pTP/NPM1.1/viral DNA complex. Apart from genome replication, NPM1 also plays a role in viral assembly of adenovirus. During the late stage of viral infection, the viral protein V interacts with NPM1, which acts as a chaperone by transferring the newly synthesized core protein to the viral DNA genome (Matthews and Russell 1998; Samad et al. 2007) .",

KSHV remains in latency stage after infection but the virus can be reactivated by various intra-and extra-cellular factors, including cytokines, hypoxia, and chemical agents (Miller et al. 2007 ). In addition, interactions of the viral protein with host transcription factors and components of the host cellular signaling pathways may reactivate the virus. The KSHV latent protein v-cyclin and host cellular CDK6 kinase can phosphorylate NPM1 on threonine 199 (Sarek et al. 2010) .

The positive-sense RNA genome of HCV encodes the viral envelope, core protein, and several other nonstructural proteins (Choo et al. 1991; Takamizawa et al. 1991 ). Among various HCV viral proteins, the core protein is the best studied. Instead of being a viral nucleocapsid, the core protein interacts with various host cellular factors and influences various host cell functions including apoptosis, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation (Fischer et al. 2007; Koike 2007) . One of the host cellular factors that interact with HCV is NPM1. The virus interacts with NPM1 through the NLSs located in the core protein amino acid 51-100 (Chen et al. 2003) and is transported into the nucleolus. During HCV infection, NPM1 together with YY1 and P300 forms complex with HCV (Mai et al. 2006 ). This relieves the suppression effect of YY1 on the NPM1 promoter, thereby up-regulating the expression of NPM1, which in turn activates RNA polymerase I transcription and results in higher rate of ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this promotes cell proliferation during viral infection, and consequently leads to cell transformation and hepatocellular carcinogenesis.",

The 30-kb positive-sense RNA genome encodes the viral envelope, nucleocapsid, hemagglutinin, and membrane-associated proteins . The nucleocapsid protein is involved in viral assembly and also regulation of signal transduction. It is mainly localized in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV-infected cells, but the protein is also present at low level in the nucleus (Tamini et al. 2005) . The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is able to interact with various cellular proteins, including cyclophylin A (Luo et al. 2004) , human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Fan et al. 2006) , and CDK-cyclin complex proteins (Surjit et al. 2006 ). NPM1 interacts with nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV and, during the interaction, the viral protein competitively inhibits the interaction of NPM1 with CDK2 kinase, and thereby inhibits the phosphorylation of NPM1 . A decrease in phosphorylation inhibits the duplication of centromere, which leads to subsequent cell cycle arrest. In addition, interaction of the viral nucleocapsid protein with NPM1 may also cause defects in ribosome synthesis and results in suppression of gene expression, or leads to protein misfolding .",

Its significance stems from the fact that NPMc+ AML accounts for ~30% of all AML cases and usually has good prognosis. Its clinical importance also comes from its involvement in virus replication, particularly in the era of outbreaks of infectious diseases. A lot more remain to be discovered and learned for all three NPM proteins in the years to come.",
