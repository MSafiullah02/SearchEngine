Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism of the Janus functions of the medicinal herbs in the treatment of influenza remains unclear. In this work, to illustrate the therapeutic concept of Janus functions in the treatment of influenza, we have introduced a novel systems pharmacology model that integrates pharmacokinetic screening, targeting and network analysis of two representative herbs Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae that are efficient in the treatment of influenza, inflammation and other diseases. 50 Chemicals with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles have been identified for the two herbs, and the ligand-target network was constructed by complementing the literature-based experimental data deposited in DrugBank. The annotation of these chemicals was assigned using a novel drug targeting approach, and mapped to target-disease and drug-target-pathway networks. The overall data suggest that the medicinal herbs function by indirectly suppressing the virus proliferation via regulating the immune systems in hosts, and also, by directly inhibiting virus proliferation through targeting viral proteins essential for the viral life cycle. For the first time, we have demonstrated the mechanism of medicinal herbs in prevention and treatment of virus diseases via the Janus functions on a systematic level.",

            "text": "Influenza pandemics, defined as epidemics of influenza viruses, are responsible for acute contagious respiratory infection, and finally result in substantial morbidity and mortality nearly every year. 1, 2 As an important treatment option, adamantane and neuraminidase (NA) as part of pandemic-preparedness plans enable us to inhibit the activities of the membrane proteins of influenza viruses. 3, 4 However, such therapy is constrained by the emergence of resistant strains. 5, 6 With the aim of reducing the drug resistance and increasing the efficacy of the therapeutic effects, the combination therapy, the use of more than one medication, has been proposed as an alternative to control the influenza diseases. 7 As the leading choice for treating the most dreadful diseases, such as cancer and infectious diseases, 8, 9 the combination drugs impact multiple targets, and are more efficacious and less vulnerable to adaptive resistance than monotherapies. 10, 11 The combination therapy has been advocated for thousands of years in herbal medicines to combat health problems, 12, 13 and more than one hundred of medicinal herbs have been found to be effective against microbes. 14 For example, the two herbs Lonicera japonica (Jinyinhua) and Fructus Forsythiae (Lianqiao) possess excellent anti-SARS coronavirus and anti-H1N1 flu virus activities. 15, 16 They are widely used as the principal components in many different formulae, such as shuanghuanglian and yinqiaosan, to clear away the heat evil and toxin, and cure fever, cough, and the swell of throat, etc. 14 As the main group of ingredients in both the herbs, flavonoids enable us to target the NA protein, and thus exhibit antiviral effects against influenza A virus. 17, 18 Also, Shuangkangsu, isolated from Lonicera japonica, displays significant inhibition to influenza B and A3 viruses. 19 In fact, for a promising influenza treatment, in addition to the antiviral defense, the antiviral agents should also enable us to eliminate/alleviate inflammation since an excessive proinflammatory response is associated with fatality following infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. 20 Fortunately, both the herbs Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae were demonstrated to enable us to regulate the host's immune system, and meanwhile, stimulate the non-specific/ specific immune responses to allothigene. For instance, luteolin isolated from the flowers of Lonicera japonica can suppress inflammatory mediator release by blocking the NF-kB and MAPKs activation pathways in HMC-1 cells; 21 Arctigenin from Fructus Forsythiae significantly decreases carrageenan-induced paw edema, arachidonic acid-induced ear edema, and acetic acidinduced writhing response and capillary permeability accentuation, respectively. 22 This evidence implies that the two herbs display Janus functions, i.e., treating virus infection in a two-faced fashion: inhibiting virus, and meanwhile, stimulating host's immune system. This suggests that the combination of anti-viral and immunomodulatory agents will be more than passing interest for the anti-viral agents singly used in patients with influenza. However, despite the attractive therapy for influenza, it is still unclear what the underlying molecular mechanism of the Janus functions in the treatment of virus disease is?",

By considering drug actions and side effects in the context of the regulatory networks within which the drug targets and disease gene products function, network analysis promises to greatly increase our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the multiple actions of drugs. 25 Thus the application of systems pharmacology to herbal medicine affords new possibilities for investigating the explicit targets of medicinal herbs' active ingredients and their interactions in the context of molecular networks, 25 and thereby highlights the molecular mechanism of their Janus functions. In the previous work, we have developed a robust model based on systems pharmacology to evaluate the efficiency of medicinal herbs and identified a series of bioactive ingredients and possible targets from these herbs. By mapping them onto functional ontologies, the resulting biologically meaningful networks for those herbs offer a deep understanding of their action mechanisms. 26, 27 In this work, we aim to verify whether medicinal herbs have Janus functions in combating virus infection, including (1) inactivating or restraining the virus directly by targeting viral proteins and pathways unique to the viral life cycle; and (2) suppressing the virus indirectly by enhancing or regulating immune system in host cells. If so, what is the underlying molecular basis? To address this, we take the two herbs Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae as examples. We firstly explored their active compound cohorts and potential targets, and then mapped these compounds and protein targets onto functional ontologies such as the compound-target associations, compoundpathway connections and target-disease interactions, which offered a means to infer details on the specific mechanisms of the herbs that led to the pathologic transition. The obtained results provided a new window over the Janus functions underlying the medicinal herbs and were beneficial for designing of compounds or combination strategies for treating influenza diseases.",

Quercetin, a flavonoid present in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, has OB of about 50%, which can reduce the susceptibility to influenza infection following stressful exercise. 48 Also, cell culture studies have illustrated that quercetin can exert cytoprotective effects against various viruses, inflammation, and oxidation. 49 As for the major saponin constituents sweroside and 7-epi-loganin, they exhibit significantly low OBs (4% and 12%, respectively), although recent studies have reported their pharmacological effects, such as antiprotozoal, antiallergic and antiviral activities. 15 The reason is that both the chemicals are triterpene glycoside compounds which fail to permeate membrane, and thus show poor oral bioavailability. Indeed, after intestinal deglycosylation, sweroside and 7-epi-loganin can display good OBs (74% and 85%, respectively), which suggests that they play their bioactivities mainly in the form of their catabolites, and probably act as prodrugs that are metabolized to the active form. 29 Similarly, some other compounds known as hederagenin glycosides also show good OB and present certain bioactivities after deglycosylation. For example, the OB of loniceroside A, a glycoside with significant anti-inflammatory activity, 50 increases from 23% to 89% as a result of glycosyl hydrolysis. This implies that loniceroside A may exhibit its biological activity primarily in the form of a non-carbohydrate moiety.",

To understand the underlying mechanism of such synergistic effect, it is important to search the knowledge about the therapeutic targets of drugs. Traditionally, such information have been generated experimentally including the sequencing of expressed-sequence tags (ESTs), serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) differential display, homology cloning, and related approaches. 62 However, this process is challenging and time-consuming, 63 and many drugs may not be predicted simply by sequence or structural homology due to their multiple physiological targets 63 To overcome this bottleneck, a new and robust approach is urgently needed to be developed that is capable of systematically analyzing protein-drug interactions. Thanks to the recent development in 'omics' technology and systems biology, we have developed a systematic approach that efficiently integrates the chemical, genomic and pharmacological information for drug targeting and discovery on a large scale, based on the RF and SVM methods. 26 Using this approach, we have searched 248 candidate targets (Table S2 in ESI \u2020) for all the 62 candidate compounds. The candidate targets are further validated by molecular docking method, and 91% targets are reserved (named as potential targets). The results show that many candidate compounds have promiscuous actions. For example, menthol (from Lonicera japonica) acts as an inducer of transient receptor potential cation channels (subfamily M member 8, subfamily A member 1, and subfamily V member 3) 64,65 and also as an agonist of kappa-type opioid receptor; 66 hyperforin (from Fructus Forsythiae) has dual specificity for canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1 (acting as an inducer) 67 and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (acting as an inhibitor); 68 Quercetin (sharing compounds from both Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae) can interact with tens of proteins such as cytochrome P450 2C8 69 and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1. 70 These confirm that herbal treatment is a multicomponent therapeutics, in which two or more active ingredients simultaneously target multiple proteins.",

Since the symptoms of influenza are roughly classified into respiratory tract diseases (e.g. respiratory tract infection and cough), nervous system diseases (e.g. headache), and pathological conditions, signs and symptoms (e.g., inflammation), the above result further confirms the effectiveness of the medicinal herbs for treating the influenza disease. For instance, as one of the hallmarks of influenza, acute respiratory distress syndrome is attributed to the hyperproduction of cytokines and chemokines in the lung, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8. 72 These cytokines are mainly released by the macrophages enriched in lung and their production is mediated by the MAPK pathway. Thus inhibition of MAPK can lower the production of these inflammatory cytokines and thereby may have a therapeutic benefit. 73 In fact, both MAPK and TNF are predicted to be targets shared by the both herbs. This result thus suggests that Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae attaches great importance to the immunity and self-adjusting functions of human beings in the treatment of influenza.",

Among these targets, thymidine kinase (TK) displays the highest degree distribution (DD = 9), followed by the lysozyme (E, DD = 4), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN, DD = 4), neuraminidase (NA, DD = 3), and DNA polymerase (UL54, DD = 2). This result suggests that Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae can directly target viral proteins. For example, neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin are antigenic glycoproteins on the surface of influenza virions. Both of them recognize the carbohydrate structures and bind to the sialic acid receptor on the surface of the host cell, which aids the entry of the virus. 74 Then the NA antigen cleaves the terminal linkage of the sialic acid receptor, thereby leading to the release of the progeny virions from the infected host cells. Due to the essential role of NA in influenza viral replication, spread and pathogenesis, NA and HN are considered to be attractive targets for combating influenza. 75 By analyzing the T-D network as described above, we suggest that the two medicinal herbs can limit the virus infection by targeting the viral protein directly.",

The above C-Th and C-Tv networks show that the herbs, Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae, possess Janus functions-regulating human immune system to resist virus activity and meanwhile, directly inhibiting the viral protein. Although the mechanisms of actions of the herbs seem to have little in common, they are reconcilable in the treatment of influenza. After being threatened by viruses such as influenza, the innate immune system of human provides a first line of defense against pathogens. Thus many proteins in immune system, such as TLRs, MAPKs and PPARs, become attractive targets for limiting the infection with influenza virus. For instances, (1) TLRs, germline encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), recognize virion glycoproteins (hemagglutinin) 76 and then rapidly initiate a cascade of events that results in the expression of a variety of genes involved in the inflammatory and immune responses. 77 The inhibition of TLRs pathway can effectively suppress the influenza A virus-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and viral replication. 78 Similarly, euxanthone from Fructus Forsythiae, which is predicted to inhibit TLRs, also probably inactivates the influenza; (2) p38 MAPK activation has been shown to contribute to the hyperinduction of TNF-a in response to influenza virus infection, which is a critical step in influenza virus replication. Thus it has been suggested that p38 MAPK inhibitors could be used to limit the viral replication. 76 Here, we find that molecule quercetin (involved in both herbs) is able to inhibit MAPK, and thus reduce the TNF-a-induced chemokine secretion, 79 verifying that both herbs have important implications for the host resistance against influenza virus infection;",

However, the molecular mechanism of medicinal herbs exerting therapeutic effects on the special disease is still unknown. Here, we used a systems pharmacology approach by integrating the OB screening, targets prediction and validation, and network analysis to probe the molecular mechanisms of action of the representative medicinal herbs Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae for the influenza disease treatment. Our results show that:",
