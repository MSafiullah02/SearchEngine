It is well known that ketamine increases blood pressure and heart rate by releasing endogenous catecholamines, causes bronchodilation, is a potent analgesic and sedative, and has minimal effects on respiratory status. 6 It would be exciting to study ketamine as part of a sedation regimen, in double blindrandomized fashion, for patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. If the antiinflammatory effects it confers reduce the risk of cytokine storm and the negative effects of inflammation, there may be a morbidity and mortality benefit. A new use for this cost-effective, safe, and readily available medication could revolutionize the efforts to treat this global pandemic.",
