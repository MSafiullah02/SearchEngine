This work is the first to systematically study host glycomic 28 changes in response to influenza virus infection, identifying high mannose as a key 29 feature of differential host response. 30",

Rather, high 126 mannose, an epitope not typically associated with influenza pathogenesis, appears 127 to directly correlate with severity. ferrets. In general, we observed a correlation between damage to the lung, as 137 defined by consolidation and inflammatory cell infiltrate, and staining with the high 138 mannose binding lectin HHL (Fig. 2a) . In normal lung, HHL staining was confined to 139 the bronchiole epithelium and basement membrane. In contrast, in infected and 140 consolidated lung tissues we observed binding to compacted alveolar spaces and 141 bronchial plugs. We also observed binding to inflammatory cells and sloughed 142 bronchial epithelium. We observe a strong correlation between HHL staining and the 143 alveolar severity score, which reflects alveolar damage and inflammation caused by 144 the infection (Fig. 2b) . Overall, our data shows that high mannose is associated with 145 both direct damage to the lungs, observed by histology, and overall illness levels, 146 observed by weight loss. To examine whether glycomic changes in the host occur early or late in 156 influenza pathogenesis, we performed a time-course analysis where infected ferrets 157 were sacrificed at days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 14 (n=12 for days 1-3, n=8 for day 5, n=19 for 158 day 8, n=8 for day 14, for a total of 59 ferrets). We analyzed 2 lung punch biopsies 159 per ferret. The time course experiments and our previously discussed analysis were 160 performed concurrently and analyzed on the same set of arrays. Thus, data for day 161 8 ferrets and control (day 0) samples are the same as in Figure 1a . High mannose, which correlates to severity at day 8, was strongly induced in 180 some ferrets at day 1 (Fig. 3a) . At this early time point we are unable to predict 181 whether ferrets with higher levels of high mannose have a more severe 182 immunological response to influenza virus infection overall. However, HHL staining 183 of virally infected lungs from ferrets sacrificed at day 1 correlated with damage in the 184 lung tissue (Fig. 3b) , similar to observations at day 8 (Fig. 2a) .

In line with our observation in 220 ferret lungs and our microscopy data, we again observed an increase in high 221 mannose (GRFT, SVN, HHL, UDA). However, we did not observe a corresponding 222 virus glycoproteins (Fig. 5b, Supplemental Fig. 11) . Upon infection, we detect 240 increased levels of high mannose across multiple proteins, both influenza and host, 241 as determined by HHL binding. We observed a strong increase in high mannose for 242 a band correlating to NA (indicated by arrows, Fig. 5b) . Quantitation of the lectin 243 blot, excluding presumed HA and NA proteins, reveals a 120% increase in HHL of key UPR markers HSP90B1 (also known as Grp94) and HYOU1 (40) in ferret lung 259 on day 1 post-infection (Fig. 6a) . This indicates that UPR is rapidly induced by (Fig. 6b, Supplemental Fig. 12a ). This indicates that induction of the high 267 mannose epitope occurs downstream of the XBP1s arm of the UPR. Lectin 268 microarray analysis revealed 4\u03bc8C inhibited high mannose but did not impact the 269 change in sialylation observed upon infection, arguing that the impact of inhibiting 270 this pathway is specific to the high mannose response (Supplemental Fig. 12b) . To test whether recognition is dependent upon the high mannose epitope, we 301 removed all high mannose and hybrid N-glycans using Endo H. Removal of these 302 glycans abolished the signal, providing evidence that the recognition is via the high 303 mannose epitope (Fig. 7) . Our data suggest a potential role for high mannose in 304 recruiting MBL2 to host tissue in influenza virus infection; this could contribute to 305 severity through activation of the complement cascade and corresponding 306 inflammatory response. 307",

In brief, cells were infected with A/Puerto 195 Rico/8/1934(H1N1) (PR8), an H1N1 strain commonly used in cell culture 196 experiments. After 24 h, cells were fixed and stained for influenza nucleoprotein 197(anti-influenza antibody, green) and high mannose(HHL, red, Fig. 4a).

HA is the major 231 glycoprotein of influenza. N-glycosylation of HA is important in receptor binding, 232 immune response, and viral stability (33). Glycosylation of NA is essential for the 233 enzyme activity (33). M2, a small transmembrane protein of about 11 KD, is at 10-234 100 fold lower abundance than HA on the virus surface and has a putative N-235 glycosylation site at which glycosylation is not commonly observed (33-36).

Influenza virus activates the IRE1 251 arm of the UPR pathway, inducing the active form of the transcription factor XBP1 252 (XBP1s) (37). Influenza severity and lung injury in mouse models directly correlate 253 with the degree of induction of this pathway (13). Recent studies have shown that 254 activation of XBP1s in cells can alter glycosylation in a cell type dependent manner, 255 providing a potential link between influenza infection and the observed changes in 256 host glycosylation (38, 39).

            "text": "Immune Activator MBL2 Recognizes Infected Cells via High Mannose. 273 Currently, there is an emerging consensus that over-activation of the innate 274 immune response may be a dominant cause of lung injury and influenza severity 275 (20, 25). Carbohydrate recognition plays a significant role in innate immunity 276 mediated by a series of innate immune lectins including the dendritic cell-specific 277 intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), human DC 278 immunoreceptor (DCIR), langerin, dectin-2, mincle, mannan-binding lectin (MBL2), 279 and surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A/D) (12, 42). Innate immune lectins are thought 280 to protect against infection through recognition of foreign pathogens. We focused 281 our attention on MBL2. MBL2 binds influenza viral particles and was originally 282 ascribed a protective role (43). However, knockout of MBL2 in mouse mitigated the 283 severity of influenza infection, rather than increasing viral load as originally theorized 284 (18). Upon binding, MBL2 activates the complement cascade and corresponding 285 inflammatory response (44). A recent study on critically ill patients infected with 286 H1N1pdm09 virus showed a strong correlation between levels of MBL2 in the blood 287 and patient death (19). In addition, schizophrenics and multiple sclerosis patients, 288 both have high levels of MBL2 and unusually high death rates from influenza and 289 pneumonia (45-48). These studies strongly suggest that MBL2 plays a determining 290 role in the severity of response, but how this occurs is unknown. 291 MBL2 recognizes several glycan epitopes including Lewis structures (14, 15), 292 high mannose (16), yeast mannans (17) and fucose (15). Given that high mannose 293 is a ligand for MBL2, we wanted to test whether MBL2 would recognize influenza 294virus-infected human cells. We incubated infected and control A549 cells with 295 recombinant human MBL2 and examined binding by fluorescence microscopy(Fig. 296 7). Uninfected A549 cells were not recognized by MBL2. In contrast, infected cells 297 were strongly recognized by the innate immune lectin. This data is in keeping with 298 previous work that demonstrated complement-dependent lysis of influenza-infected 299 hamster cells mediated through binding of guinea pig mannan-binding lectin (49).",

In contrast, 313 little is known about change in the host glycome upon pathogen invasion and how 314 this might impact disease progression. 315 Herein, we use a ferret model of influenza virus infection in tandem with our 316 lectin microarray technology (6, 8) to study the host response to the 2009 H1N1 317 influenza virus and its relationship to disease progression. Our data suggest that 318 induction of high mannose upon influenza virus infection is a key mediator of 319 severity. Based on our work and the current literature, we hypothesize that activation 320 of the unfolded protein response (UPR) upon influenza infection turns on expression 321 of high mannose, which is then recognized by the innate immune lectin MBL2, 322",

This hypothesis, which requires further testing, 337 could be relevant for not only influenza but also other respiratory viruses where the 338 innate immune system plays a role in severity, such as SARS-CoV-2 (54). It predicts 339 that an overabundance of high mannose (as seen in the ferrets) or high MBL2 (as 340 seen in patients) can dysregulate the immune system, leading to severe damage 341 and death. Notably, two populations that have high levels of activated MBL2, 342 schizophrenics and multiple sclerosis patients, have unusually high death rates from 343 influenza and pneumonia (45-48). Our work provides a potential new pathway for 344 intervention in influenza virus infection that could spur the development of therapies 345 that would make influenza virus-induced disease no more deadly than the common 346cold. 347 348 METHODS 349 Influenza virus and infection of ferrets. Fitch ferrets (Mustela putorius furo, 350 female) were obtained from Triple F Farms (Sayre) and verified as negative for 351 antibodies to circulating influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses. Adult ferrets 352 were defined as 6-12 months of age. Ferrets were pair housed in stainless steel 353 cages (Shor-Line) containing Sani-Chips laboratory animal bedding (P.J. Murphy 354 Forest Products) and provided with food and fresh water ad libitum. Ferrets were 355 administered intranasally the H1N1pdm09 virus, A/California/07/2009, at a dose of 356 10 6 PFU. The animals were monitored daily for weight loss and disease symptoms 357 including elevated temperature, low activity level, sneezing, and nasal discharge. 358 Animals were randomly assigned to be sacrificed at day 1, 3, 5, 8, or 14 post-359 infection (DPI) or euthanized if their clinical condition (e.g., loss of >20% body 360 weight) required it. Blood was collected from anesthetized ferrets via the subclavian 361 vena cava post-infection. Serum was harvested and frozen at -20 \u00b1 5\u00b0C. After serum 362 was collected, necropsies were performed to collect lung tissue. Severity of infection 363was determined for all ferrets studied who were sacrificed at day 8 or later (n=45) 364 using quartiles to define populations. The lowest quartile was defined as mild (weight 365 loss less than 10.5%), the middle quartile as moderate (weight loss between 10.5% 366 and 16.2%), and the highest quartile as severe (weight loss greater than 16.2%). 367Lectin microarray. Ferret lung tissue samples were washed with PBS 369supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktails (PIC) and sonicated on ice in PBS 370 with PIC until it was completely homogenous. Then the homogenized samples were 371 prepared and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled as previously described(7). Reference was 372 prepared by mixing equal amounts (by total protein) of all samples and labeled with 373Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher). SupplementalTable 1summarizes the print list 374 and buffers. Printing, hybridization, and data analysis were performed as previously 375 described(7).376 377 Lectin histochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (5 \u00b5m) 378 containing left upper and lower lung lobes were cleared in Histoclear (3 x 5 min) 379 (National Diagnostics). Sections were rehydrated with graded alcohols as follows: 380 100% ethanol (2 x 5 min), 95% ethanol (1 x 5 min), 70% ethanol (1 x 5 min), and H20 381 (1 x 5 min). To inactivate endogenous peroxidases, rehydrated sections were 382 immersed in 3% H2O2/70% methanol solution (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min. Sections 383 were incubated with biotin-conjugated HHL (1:300, Vector Laboratories) overnight 384 at 4\u00b0C. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with an avidin/biotin-based 385 peroxidase system (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit, Vector Laboratories) followed 386 by substrate deposition with VECTOR NovaRED Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit 387 (Vector Laboratories). Nuclear counterstain was performed with Gill's Hematoxylin 388 (American MasterTech Scientific) followed by mounting with Permount (Fisher 389 Scientific). 390 391 Cell culture and infection assays. The A549 cell line (ATCC) was grown in media 392 [F-12K medium with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Atlanta Biologicals)] at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. For 393 the infection assay, A549 cells were seeded at a density of 250,000 cells in a 35 mm 394 glass-bottom dish and allowed to grow under standard culture conditions (37\u00b0C, 5% 395 CO2); 24 h later the dish was washed with PBS and treated with PR8 virus (MOI = 396 2) in the infection medium [F-12K with 2% BSA fraction V (Thermo Fisher), 1% 397 antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Fisher), and 1 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin 398 (Worthington Biochemical)] for 1 h (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2).
