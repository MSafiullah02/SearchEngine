            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV), a novel human betacoronavirus, was first isolated in 2012 following the fatality of a patient with severe acute respiratory infection in Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012). The genomic sequencing and public release of that isolate (van Boheemen et al., 2012) enabled the development of several real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)\u2013based assays to facilitate laboratory detection and confirmation of MERS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens. Screening assays have primarily targeted genomic regions upstream of the envelope gene (UpE), while confirmatory assays have targeted viral open reading frames 1a (ORF1a), ORF1b, or both (ORF1ab) (Corman et al., 2012a, Corman et al., 2012b). More recently, alternative genomic targets have included the nucleocapsid (N) (Lu et al., 2014) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes (Corman et al., 2012b). Following deployment of these molecular assays, reports of MERS-CoV cases continue to rise both regionally and globally. According to WHO statistics, as of 31 August 2016, a total of 1800 laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV cases including 640 related deaths have been reported in 27 countries. Rapid and reliable detection of MERS-CoV is therefore essential to controlling the spread of this emerging threat.",

During the initial stages of MERS-CoV spread, these assays enabled rapid diagnosis to support the public health response to MERS-CoV. However, as with other currently available commercial assays, evaluation of the clinical sensitivities of these kits has been limited to virus spiked mock samples or small numbers of clinical specimens from MERS-CoV infected cases. Due to the recent increase in commercially available MERS-CoV rRT-PCR kits (n = 16) (Pas et al., 2015), there is a need to evaluate assay performances on different specimen types to better understand their diagnostic effectiveness.",

Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted as described in Section 2.2 above, except that an extraction (internal) control was added to each specimen. During the reverse transcription stage, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the cDNA Synthesis Premix kit (Seegene). Two microliters of random hexamer and 8 \u03bcL of extracted RNA were added to prealiquoted tubes containing 10-\u03bcL cDNA synthesis master mix and amplified according to the manufacturers' instructions. Once complete, real-time respiratory virus detection reactions were set up using the RV16 TOM-A and TOM-B sets. These 2 master mixes together enable detection of the above 16 respiratory viruses and internal control. Duplicate 20-\u03bcL reaction volumes were set up containing 8 \u03bcL of cDNA, 5 \u03bcL of 4\u00d7 RV16 Primers (TOM-A or TOM-B), 5 \u03bcL of 4\u00d7 Anyplex\u2122 master mix, and 2-\u03bcL water.

Comparatively, our modification of the GeneSig\u00ae protocol (assay 3B) improved MERS-CoV RNA detection to 73.5% (25/34).",

For these purposes, the European Virus Archive has produced quantitative standards for UpE and Orf1a. However, we were unable to obtain these standards during this investigation. Nevertheless, the TIB MolBiol\u00ae LightMix and GeneSig\u00ae protocols (Assays 2\u20133) produced some single gene\u2013positive (indeterminate) results, which in a clinical diagnostic setting would require further confirmation by screening a secondary specimen (ideally from the LRT where a higher viral load is expected) before overall interpretation as \u201cMERS-CoV negative\u201d.

The other 5 assays used in that study highlight the diversity in MERS-CoV test availability between Korea and Saudi Arabia. Kim et al. (2016) were able to utilize an updated version of the Anyplex\u2122 assay (although pre-CE-IVD approval), which detected UpE and internal control (versus version 1 of the assay used in our study which incorporated melt-peak analysis only). Nine LRT sputum specimens were used to determine assay sensitivities, a further 9 LRT specimens were used to evaluate the effects of PCR inhibition on positive results, and 28 nasopharyngeal swabs were used to evaluate assay cross-reactivity. The overall sensitivity and specificity of all 6 assays were deemed sufficient for diagnostic use. However, sputum specimens were shown to be particularly PCR inhibition prone, negatively impacting assay sensitivity, and highlighted the importance of optimizing pretreatment and RNA extraction procedures when using this specimen type. In comparison, PCR inhibition was not observed in the NPOP specimens used in the present study, and minimal variations were observed in the internal control CT values. Nevertheless, the CT values for the LightMix assay reported from sputum specimens (Kim et al., 2016) were comparable with those of our URT specimens.",
