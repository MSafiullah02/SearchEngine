The major and tragic outbreak of Ebola virus disease that started in 2013 with its epicenter in the impoverished nation of Guinea has once again thrust this disease into the limelight [2]. Ebola virus outbreaks have held a special public fascination since the mid-1990s. A deadly virus mysteriously emerges from the remote jungles of sub-Saharan Africa, wreaking unspeakable havoc on nearby villagers, and then just as mysteriously recedes from whence it came. Unknowingly, an unlucky traveler in the area is also infected, incubating the virus as he completes his travels and arrives home to a major metropolitan area. Suddenly, fever sets in, and within days the man is deathly ill, bleeding from the eyes, his internal organs liquefying. His disease quickly spreads to all those in proximity. Case numbers mount rapidly. Chaos ensues, overwhelming the local healthcare system. Fears that the event is a bioterrorist attack rattle the population. Such is the notion of Ebola virus garnered from popular accounts, such as Richard Preston's best-selling novel The Hot Zone and the 1995 film Outbreak. Although such scenarios may still sell movies, accumulating scientific knowledge and experience debunk much of this popular notion.",

Although they are obviously very dangerous, it is now clear that Ebola and Marburg viruses are far less transmissible than first feared, requiring direct contact with blood and bodily fluids during the period of acute illness. The risk of significant secondary transmission from imported cases into industrialized countries, where protective materials and clean needles are routinely available and used, is low. Natural transmission through aerosol seems to be rare, if it occurs at all. Both field and laboratory research have shed light on the epidemiology of these viruses, which are all zoonotic. Bats seem to be the reservoir for the filoviruses, and seasonal fluctuations in bat breeding populations and proportions of infected animals may influence risk of transmission to humans [5\u20137]. Numerous experimental vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in animal models and have recently been accelerated into clinical trials in humans [8, 9].",

Nevertheless, the factors dictating the location of large filovirus outbreaks have been empirically clear for decades, if understated, and are inevitably intertwined with the sociopolitical landscape. Such outbreaks almost invariable occur in areas where the public health system has been decimated from years of civil conflict or failed development (Table 1) [3, 10\u201313]. Biological and ecological factors may drive emergence of these viruses from the jungle, but clearly the sociopolitical landscape dictates whether they are then confined to a few isolated cases or explode into a major outbreak.

Consequently, when a patient with filovirus infection, presumably representing one of the early infections from a zoonotic source, presents to one of these centers, the likelihood of hospital-based transmission is high. Having few options, the healthcare worker may reuse the needle just used to administer an injection to the patient with (unrecognized) Ebola virus disease for the patient with malaria in the next bed, who subsequently leaves the hospital cured of malaria but incubating Ebola virus. This person then falls ill at home, infecting a few family members in the process, who then come to the hospital, renewing the cycle of hospital-based transmission and delivery to the community. The absence of gloves and other personal protective equipment also puts healthcare workers at risk; indeed, many filovirus outbreaks are first detected by noting clusters of infection and deaths among healthcare workers. Thus, filovirus outbreaks can be considered fundamental problems related to a lack of a basic human right\u2014the right to health, defined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights as \u201ca standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.\u201d [15].",
