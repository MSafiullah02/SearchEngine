It is a multifactorial biofilm-mediated disorder, which is initiated by dysbiosis in the biofilm complex, where certain bacteria take the dominance over others in the oral flora. It has been shown that many bacteria are involved in the genesis of caries formation at different stages. Among these Streptococcus mutans is the primary causative agent of dental caries (Alam et al. 2018).",

Fusion vaccines (pGJA-p/VAX and pGJG/GAC/VAX) encoding PAc and GLU of S. mutans were also tested in gnobiotic animals (Kt et al. 2013) and flagellin-PAc fusion protein (KF-rPAc) was also tested in rats for anticaries vaccine (Bao et al. 2015). Antibodies raised against recombinant form of substrate binding component of the phosphate uptake system (rPstS) of S. mutans have shown protective response against caries formation (Ferreira et al. 2016). Cao et al. (2016) found no significant effect of specific s-IgA antibody on caries formation. Yang et al. (2019) developed the intranasal cold-adapted influenza vaccine, which was limited by the large size of the vector than S. mutans epitope, this resulted in memory immune response thus reducing the duration and intensity of exogenous antigens. Among the various proteins of S. mutans, dextransucrase has an essential role in the synthesis of glucan from sucrose, thus play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the caries (Talbman and Smith 1974).",

To further study the inhibitory effect of purified antibody on the enzyme activity of dextransucrase, immunotritation was evaluated. Increasing concentrations of the IgG from 0 to 70 \u03bcg/ml to enzyme protein were added and enzyme activity was assayed after 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. As shown in Table 1, there was a progressive increase in the percentage inhibition from 2.58 to 18.22 as compared with the control. Thus, antibody against dextransucrase exhibited inhibitory effect on the activity of dextransucrase isolated from S. mutans.",

The raised antibodies were checked for affinity with dextransucrase using dot blot assay which showed significant reactivity and further validated by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy which confirmed specific binding of dextransucrase antibody with the cells of S. mutans. Dextransucrase helps S. mutans in the metabolism of sucrose for its growth and producing water-insoluble glucans with mixed \u03b1-1, 3 and \u03b1-1, 6 linkages (Moye et al. 2014) which are involved in the attachment of S. mutans on the tooth surfaces and in the biofilm formation (Bowen and Koo 2011) leading to caries formation. Immunotitration of dextransucrase with purified dextransucrase antibody showed a progressive increase in percentage inhibition of enzyme activity, although the antibody titre was high, presumably due to its polyclonal nature. Also it was observed that the growth of S. mutans in the presence of different concentrations of antibody under in vitro conditions was inhibited, which correlated with the inhibitory effect on dextransucrase activity; however, the values were quantitatively distinct. This is in agreement to the studies of Culshaw et al. (2007) on anticaries protection after immunisation of animals with intact GTF. Transferase activity of dextransucrase also showed a significant reduction in presence of anti-dextransuccrase antibody which may help in reducing glucan formation.",

Song et al. (2015) have shown that biofilm formation is strongly dependent upon the surface adhesion and hydrophobicity of the material. More recently, Nilsson et al.

This was further confirmed by other investigators and these immunologically cross-reactive polypeptides were found in the cell membrane of S. mutans (Giasuddin et al. 2017). Subunit vaccines have also been tried to overcome the cross reactivity but were reported having less immunogenicity (Zhang 2013). It is also assumed that besides S. mutans, other oral bacteria also play a role in the pathogenesis of dental caries although the mechanism is not established. Nevertheless, the inhibitory effect of dextransucrase antibodies against several cariogenic factors of S. mutans may be helpful in formulating strategies to combat the disease (Alam et al. 2018). Present data showed that the antibodies generated did not cross react with protein extracts from the liver, heart, lungs and kidneys of mice, rat and rabbit by western blot analysis.

The reactivity with the L. acidophilus and S. aureus suggests a similar epitope recognised between two strains. Since the dextransucrase antibody recognised the similar epitopes on the two oral strains, it can be predicted that anti-dextransucrase antibodies raised against S. mutans could recognise other species of the oral cavity, thereby strengthens the support to dextransucrase as a candidate vaccine against dental caries and shared epitopes between cariogenic strains can show better efficacy in clinical trials.",

Our preliminary observations also indicated that dextransucrase antibodies when added to the growth media inhibited acid production and reduced hydrophobicity of S. mutans (results not shown) which further corroborated the anticariogenic properties of the dextransucrase antibodies. Moreover, examination of various animal and human tissues showed no cross reactivity with dextransucrase antibody which implies that they may have no harmful physiological effects in the humans, thus may prove a promising antigen for developing anticariogenic agent. Further studies to characterise the cariogenic effects of antibody against dextransucrase are underway to ascertain these findings.",
