Epidemiology is not a science with a clearly defined field of application in contrast to anatomy or gastroenterology, which target specific parts or aspects of the human body. Rather it is a scientific method which can be applied to a broad range of health and medical problems, from infectious diseases to health care. Epidemiology is a constantly changing field of science, because new questions arise in population health and new statistical techniques are developed and adapted from other sciences. In times of modern information technologies and high-speed computers, new opportunities arise for data collection and storage on a large scale and for application of advanced bio-informatic and modelling techniques. In the era of globalization, many health problems are relevant on a global scale and intervention strategies have to be developed on an international level. In particular, for infectious disease epidemiology, global spread is increasingly important as demonstrated by the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the pandemic spread of influenza A.",

Therefore, epidemiology describes health and disease in terms of frequencies and distributions of determinants and conditions in a population or in a specific group of a population. Epidemiology also includes the study of associations between specific diseases and factors to which populations are exposed. In this way, risk factors or protective factors which are associated with a health status of an individual or with some conditions can be identified. These associations can be identified because risk factors and diseases are not randomly distributed in populations but rather there are population groups where some diseases and associated factors occur more often than in other population groups. Commonly, risk factors are distributed by age and often also differ for men and women.",

Some criteria which demonstrate a possible causal relationship between identified factors and disease have been developed (causal criteria by Hill; Rothman and Greenland 2008). Based on epidemiological studies, specific hypotheses that tell us which potential factors may play a causal role in the development of certain diseases can be generated.

Through targeted epidemiological studies it was found that an infectious agent was responsible for this syndrome. Sexual contact was identified as an important transmission route, because homosexual men who had many sexual partners contracted the disease more frequently than those with only few partners. Later the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was characterised in the laboratory as the cause of the disease and an antibody test was developed. Epidemiological studies had to a certain extent a filter function for gaining insight into this new infectious disease by sorting a wide set of potential aetiological factors and elucidating the infectious nature of the disease. This hypothesis was then checked in the laboratory and proven through the identification of the infectious agent. Thereafter, epidemiology had not lost its important role in the investigation of the HIV epidemic. On the contrary, epidemiological studies continue to play a significant role for surveillance and prevention of this globally devastating infectious disease.",

The natural history of HIV infection in its initial stages is characterized by acute retroviral syndrome, which is accompanied by fever, substantial viral pathology and viremia, followed by a long-lasting latent period, where a relative equilibrium between HIV and the immune system of the infected individual exists despite active viral replication. Following an early clinical stage, full-blown AIDS may develop, which is marked by a collapse of the immune system.

Infectious agents can be prions, viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites. The disease can then be caused either by the pathogens themselves after replication in the infected host or by their toxic products. The exposure to an infectious agent depends on its transmission route. Different outcomes of an exposure to an infectious agent can be observed (Fig. 5.2). The outcome may or may not depend on the infectious dose or the inoculum size. For very infectious pathogens a small dose may result in infection of the host, while for less infectious pathogens higher doses of a pathogen are needed for infection. For example, exposure to hepatitis B virus via sexual contact has a much higher probability for resulting in infection than does exposure to HIV. For some infections the relationship between infectious dose and probability of infection can be quantified by dose\u2013response relationships (Teunis et al. 1999).\n\n",

Carriers are of large importance for the spread of infections and for intervention, because they are not easily recognized or detected. A carrier of an infection is usually not aware of his/her infection and the risk they pose towards their direct contacts. Therefore, susceptible contact persons do not take precautions against being infected. It is difficult to target public health measures to prevent risky contacts and to identify sources of infection (e.g. hepatitis B infection, HIV).

Immunity can be acquired either after natural infection or indirectly. Maternal antibodies protect the newborn child against many infections in the first few months of its life.

Therefore, incubation periods are often better described as incubation time distributions with a minimal, a mean or median and a maximal incubation time (Fig. 5.4). In outbreaks one frequently observes several generations of an infection, i.e. clusters of cases with typical time intervals between their days of symptom onset (Fig. 5.5). The first case, or index case, in an outbreak is of great importance because he or she brings the infectious disease into the community. Secondary cases are those infected by the index case, tertiary cases those infected by a secondary case, etc. The typical time interval between the onset of symptoms in a case and the onset of symptoms in the cases infected by him/her is called the generation interval or serial interval. The distribution of this interval is determined by the durations of latent period and infectious period, and by the contact rates of infectious individuals (Fine 2003).\n\n",

Droplet spread occurs by sneezing, coughing or talking at a short distance. Droplet spread is defined as direct transmission because it is transmitted by a direct spray over a few metres before droplets fall to the ground. Indirect transmission takes place through vectors or via the environment. A vector is an invertebrate animal that becomes infected from infected animals or persons and transmits the infection to other persons, e.g. the Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria parasites from person to person. Vectors are typically insects or arthropods. Also, medical devices like injection syringes can act as vectors for disease transmission. Furthermore, environmental transmission occurs through water, food, soil, air, and solid surfaces depending on where a pathogen can best survive outside the host.",

In times of globalization, transnational migration is of great importance for the spread of infectious diseases. The border cannot be seen as a barrier anymore as many infectious diseases have a long incubation period, which makes it difficult to control the spread of infectious diseases. On the other side, migrant populations are often marginalized in the society, which makes them vulnerable to certain diseases (Tselmin et al. 2007). Socio-economic inequalities also play an important role in the spread of infectious diseases. The poor population often lives in overcrowded households with inadequate sanitation conditions. These people usually have a worse nutritional status which makes them more vulnerable to infectious diseases.

The benefits of this type of research are the following: (a) community members are considered to be the study partners and not just objects of research; (b) the knowledge of the community is used to better understand health problems in the community; (c) interventions can be directly conducted in the community. Close collaboration between communities and researchers is essential to develop adequate public health strategies that address community concerns (Kone et al. 2000).
