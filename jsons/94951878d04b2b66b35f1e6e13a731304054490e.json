These providers will be important resources during a surge response. Many providers rely on elective and private work for their financial well-being, thus postponing elective surgery may work against their financial incentives. However, improved health worker and patient safety through reduced transmission is a compelling enough argument. To facilitate decision making and avoid conflicts, a triage algorithm needs to be established and enforced, such as that proposed by the American College of Surgeons: https://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeons/triage. Patients should be kept geographically separate from COVID+ patients and discharged expeditiously to minimize nosocomial transmission (6)(7) (8) . If case burden is high, consider dedicating one OR to COVID+ operations only (ideally with neutral or negative pressure) (9) . This should be emptied of all non-essential materials and equipment. No unnecessary items should be brought into the operating room, including personal items such as mobile phones and pens. Personal linens and coverings such as cloth masks and bonnets should be washed at least daily, and probably more often when treating COVID+ patients.",

Whenever practicable, decrease case duration and limit aerosol-generating maneuvers (such as the free release of pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy). Patients should be recovered in the OR, and prior to transport an advance runner sent to clear the path. Consider using a Checklist to ensure appropriate precautions are taken for operations with suspected or known COVID-19 patients (Figure) (7) . Viral filters and appropriate circuit cleaning measures are essential and should be reviewed (6)(23), otherwise ventilation mechanics may disseminate aerosols throughout an ICU. If singleuse plastic anesthesia or surgical equipment (endotracheal tubes, ventilator circuit tubing, plastic suction tubing, electrocautery handpieces) must be reused, ensure that disinfection aiming for -high-level disinfection\u2016 or -sterility\u2016 is employed, including immersion in appropriate concentration glutaraldehyde, phenol, or hydrogen peroxide solution (7)(20)(24).",

Familiarity with severe resource shortages may guide creative and innovative strategies to conserve and extend resources. Extended use of N95 masks (continuous wearing while seeing multiple patients) is preferred to limited reuse of N95 masks (doffing and redonning between patients) (26) . N95 mask life may be lengthened by wearing a plastic face shield or a surgical mask over it. Use of chlorine or alcohol solution to sanitize N95 masks damages mask integrity; however heating to 70\u00b0C (160\u00b0F) in a dry oven for 30 minutes seems a promising solution to disrupt viral particles and maintain mask integrity for reuse (27) Cloth attire in the form of scrub hats or bonnets should be washed between each use if possible, and no less than daily. If gowns are repurposed for isolation units, they should be washed after each prolonged care routine; consider wearing rubber aprons under such gowns. The protection afforded by cloth masks is not well studied but may be significantly less than surgical masks and is not protective to the same extent as N95 respirators; it should be used as a last option only (5) (29)(32)(33)(34)(35)(36).",

Facilities should create a committee and utilize standardized risk assessments to determine allocation decisions in advance. The burden of decision making should not be placed on the frontline health care workers, nor made ad hoc at the bedside. There are multiple resources for guiding the complex decision making in resource allocation and rationing in pandemic situations (39) (40)(41)(42)(43)(44). A recent ethical framework made the following priority recommendations(45)(46), amongst others: 1. Aim to both save the most lives and most years of life, giving priority to maximizing the number of patients that survive treatment (maximizing benefit); 2. Critical testing, PPE, ICU beds, therapeutics, and vaccines should go first to front line health care workers and others who keep critical infrastructure functioning due to their instrumental value in the pandemic response and difficulty of replacing (instrumental value); and 3. Avoid first-come first serve approaches and use random allocation such as a lottery instead (equality).
