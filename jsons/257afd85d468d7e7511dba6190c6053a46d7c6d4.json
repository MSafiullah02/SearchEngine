This association can benefit the virus or the host, and thus the platelet is somewhat of a renegade. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that viruses are capable of entering platelets. For at least one type of RNA virus (dengue virus), the platelet has the necessary post-translational and packaging machinery required for production of replicative viral progeny. As a facilitator of immunity, the platelet also participates in eradicating the virus by direct and indirect mechanisms involving presentation of the pathogen to the innate and adaptive immune systems, thus enhancing inflammation by release of cytokines and other agonists. Virus-induced thrombocytopenia is caused by tangential imbalance of thrombopoeisis, autoimmunity, and loss of platelet function and integrity.",

Reminiscent of roles played by their evolutionary counterparts in primitive organisms (Delvaeye and Conway 2009) , it is now well-established that platelets directly modulate cells of the immune system through receptor-mediated cell contact with leukocytes and pathogens. In combination with these interactions, external stimuli induce secretion of cytokines and other cell modulators from platelet \u03b1-granules and dense granules to produce additional indirect effects on the cellular immune response. Moreover, in contrast to the bygone paradigms, the platelet proteome is not static. Platelets inherit from antecedent megakaryocytes a repertoire of mRNAs and the necessary post-transcriptional machinery to alter their protein composition (Schubert et al. 2014 ). Platelets survey their local environment, reacting dynamically to change, and are thus pivotally positioned during the defense against pathogens (Semple et al. 2011) . Here, we focus on their complex interactions with viruses.",

The ultimate message is that viruses trigger a complexity of biochemical and cellular events, often resulting in diminished platelet count, altered vascular permeability, and consequent bleeding diathesis. In this review, we revisit these ideas and add a temporal aspect to the emerging model.

The virus-cell interaction is the key initiating step in the virus lifecycle and a logical target for development of antiviral agents. Based on the knowledge of receptors presented on typically studied cells, predictions can be made about whether platelets express the necessary receptors to facilitate specific virus interactions. To help explain platelet-related pathology as a result of infection of certain viruses, direct binding has been reported. Here we loosely divide these interactions on the basis of two principal hemostatic diseases in which direct virus-platelet interactions could logically be involved: thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic fever (HF).",

Thus, virus-induced thrombocytopenia has been the rationale for investigating interactions between viruses and platelets. Table 1 lists viruses that correlate with thrombocytopenia without HF. Representing at least six virus families, these viruses range broadly in structure and genome organization and, with the exception of adenoviruses, are surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope that contains both host cell-and virus-derived elements. Therefore, an adaptive immune response as a result of viral infection of platelets may involve both virus antigens and co-epitopes originating from virus and host factors, resulting in a reduced platelet count. Receptors on the platelet that associate with viruses have been identified and include integrins \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 , and \u03b15\u03b23; the lectin, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grapping non-integrin (DC-SIGN); Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4; coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR); complement receptor 2 (CR2); C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4); C-type lectin domain family 2 (CLEC-2); chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL); and glycoprotein (GP) VI.

Further cellular studies implicated CAR (Bergelson et al. 1997) in the virus-platelet association and identified this receptor on platelets by flow cytometry and RNA isolation (Othman et al. 2007) . Additional studies using immunoinhibition and arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl (RGD) motif peptide mimics confirmed the importance of \u03b15 integrins in adenovirus binding to platelets; however, they failed to detect CAR expression (Shimony et al. 2009 ).",

The causative agents of viral HF are enveloped RNA viruses from four families: Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Arenaviridae, and Filoviridae (Table 2) . These families contain well-known species such as Ebola and DENV that are featured as \"headline news\" because of the devastating and graphic illnesses these epidemic pathogens can cause. Some of the viruses are especially difficult to experimentally manipulate because of their biohazard classification level and, consequently, relatively little is known about their biochemistry. Nevertheless, receptors for viruses known to cause viral HF have been identified.

Predominately from the Picornaviridae family, these non-enveloped RNA viruses cause enteric, throat, and nasal infections. Although not directly confirmed as analogous functional receptors for picornavirus on platelets, \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrins are known to facilitate interactions with receptors on other cell types. Studies following surface expression of mutated proteins in CHO cells and antibody inhibition studies have identified integrin \u03b1 2 \u03b2 1 as a binding partner for both rotavirus and echovirus (Coulson et al. 1997; Fleming et al. 2011) . Utilizing an antigenic inhibition model and CHO transfection, members of the \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrin families were shown to mediate parechovirus infection (Triantafilou et al. 2000) . This suggests the potential for binding recognition with the integrin known to be expressed on the platelet surface. It is somewhat puzzling that thrombocytopenia is not induced because engagement of these receptors by other viruses is consistent with this outcome. Consequently, integrins may not be the only common denominator resulting in this virusmediated hemostatic disorder.",

Interactions with DENV grown in culture have been shown to induce platelet shape changes, as monitored by atomic force and electron microscopy . DENV has also been demonstrated to cause the exposure of P-selectin and procoagulant phospholipid on the platelet surface (Hottz et al. 2013b; Simon et al. 2015) , and to initiate apoptosis-like markers, including caspase activation and mitochondrial permeability changes (Hottz et al. 2013b) , Similarly, HIV can induce microparticle release and other hallmarks of platelet activation (Wang et al. 2011 ) that are related to plasma virus levels (Mayne et al. 2012) . Differential response to platelet agonists in HIV-infected individuals points to functional changes in platelets, with implications for thrombosis (Satchell et al. 2010) .

The second step in the virus lifecycle is cell entry. Two general mechanisms of cell entry can be initiated upon contact between an animal virus and a target host cell. Most viruses traverse the plasma membrane using the endocytic machinery intrinsic to the cell, whereby the virus is engulfed by a vesicular structure for intracellular transport (Ghigo 2010) . Within these endosomal compartments, low pH typically induces the release of genetic contents from the viral nucleocapsid. Based on microscopic morphology and biochemistry, nearly a dozen viral endocytosis mechanisms have been discerned (Cossart and Helenius 2014; Mercer et al. 2010) . A second entry mechanism is used exclusively by enveloped viruses. After receptor-mediated cell surface binding, both virus-and host-encoded (Derry et al. 2007 ) proteins on the virus envelope can engage to form a conformational fusion complex that merges the envelope and plasma membrane.",

Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that purified HIV is trapped within platelet endosomal structures (Youssefian et al. 2002) . Another entry mechanism was suggested by colocalization of purified adenovirus with the surfaceconnected channels of the platelet open canalicular system (Stone et al. 2007) . Purified IAV and platelets enabled observation by electron microscopy of the surface association and uptake of virus-like particles into vacuolar structures (Danon et al. 1959 ). Furthermore, virus-like particles have been reported in the platelets of DENV-infected patients, although these difficult experiments lacked confirmation of virus (Noisakran et al. 2009 ). Electron microscopy has also been used to demonstrate encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) uptake by platelets in a murine model of infection (Koupenova et al. 2014 ). To confirm their endocytic capabilities, purified platelets have been shown to engulf Staphylococcus aureus (Youssefian et al. 2002) and liposomes that were engineered for drug delivery (Chan et al. 2015) . Although viral entry mechanisms are not known, molecular details following the transfer of synthetic particles into platelets suggests that several simultaneous endocytotic pathways are involved (Chan et al. 2015) . These pathways may have dynamin dependence as a common aspect and involve caveolae-or clathrinmediated uptake (Mercer et al. 2010) . Thus, observations of virus uptake by platelets are supported by the availability of entry mechanisms for other particle types.",

To demonstrate that platelets can translate viral RNA, purified platelets inoculated with purified DENV have been shown to produce viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), as detected by Western blot analysis (Simon et al. 2015) . Because the DENV single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) must first be translated as a polyprotein, the finding that NS1 had the predicted molecular weight of the mature protein implied that the functional DENV protease complex (NS2B/NS3) was also properly translated and processed by the platelets (Simon et al. 2015) . Thus, platelets not only facilitate the initial step in the virus lifecycle, specific surface engagement (Tables 1, 2, and 3), but also have the means to allow penetration of the virus into the cytoplasm and occupation of the platelet translational mechanism.",

This mechanism requires the \u03b23 integrin and chemokine receptor CCR3 to be expressed on the platelet surface. This involvement of integrins was unambiguously demonstrated using a \u03b23 Fig. 2 Virus-induced platelet modulation leading to immune clearance. Platelet receptor binding or possibly entry of the virus induces outside-in platelet signaling, with morphological and biochemical effects to the platelet. Typical platelet \"activation\" markers are expressed, such as exposure of procoagulant phospholipid (proPL) as measured by annexin V (Anx5) binding and P-selectin (CD62P). Platelet microparticles may be released. The proPL surface can propagate the hypercoagulable state often induced by some of these viruses by enabling assembly of clotting enzyme complexes, where neighboring platelet surface PARs can be activated by thrombin (FIIa) in a feedback-amplified manner to further promote platelet modulation. Virus-platelet engagement has been shown to induce caspase activation and mitochondrial membrane potential changes indicative of an apoptotic state, which similarly occurs for megakaryocytes (not shown) with consequent reduction in thrombopoeisis. Virus-induced platelet stimulation causes the release of \u03b1-granule and dense-granule contents. This has profound stimulatory effects on all cells of the immune system, orchestrating localized innate and adaptive responses against virus invasion knockout mouse model (Wang et al. 2011) . Virus-induced platelet degranulation involves the release of proinflammatory CD40 ligand, which promotes plateletmonocyte complex formation via platelet P-selectin and monocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (Singh et al. 2014 ). This was demonstrated by injecting wild-type mice with recombinant soluble CD40 ligand and analyzing cell associations by flow cytometry. The plateletmonocyte complexes derived from HIV-1 infected donors exhibited enhanced adhesion to human brain microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting a role for platelets in HIV-associated neuroinflammation (Singh et al. 2014 ).",

Selectins recognize various carbohydrate structures found on opposing surfaces. Platelets constitutively store P-selectin (i.e., CD62P) in \u03b1-granules. In response to stimulus-induced activation, P-selectin is transported to the platelet surface where it mediates tethering to numerous cell types. Important to the role of platelets in orchestrating the immune response, platelet surface P-selectin mediates adhesion through association with PSGL-1 found on the neutrophil surface. P-selectin on platelets also interacts with PSGL-1 on a subset of Th1 leukocytes. Thus, when binding of viruses to the platelet surface triggers platelet activation and P-selectin expression on the surface, innate immune clearance of the pathogen is facilitated.",

Several chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, CXCR1, and CXCR4) bind to select ligands, resulting in enhancement but not initiation of inflammatory pathways, platelet aggregation, hemostasis, and thrombosis (Zarbock et al. 2007) . Activated platelets also secrete numerous chemokines, such as CXCL7 and CXCL8. CXCL7 promotes chemotaxis, adhesion to endothelial cells, and degranulation of neutrophils (Schenk et al. 2002) , whereas CXCL8 is important in recruitment of neutrophils (Baggiolini et al. 1994) . Active CD40L is secreted by platelets in response to stimulation and binds endothelial CD40, eliciting chemokine secretion and increasing the expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelium (Henn et al. 1998) . Platelet \u03b1-granule contents have been shown to limit the spread of HIV-1 in co-cultured T cells (Solomon et al. 2013) . CXCL4 (platelet activating factor) and CXCL7 are the most abundant chemokines in the \u03b1-granules of platelets (Blair and Flaumenhaft 2009 ). In particular, CXCL4 released by activated platelets binds to HIV-1 major viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, proximal to the essential CD4-binding site (Auerbach et al. 2012) . The resulting steric inhibition reduced HIV-1 infection by 80 % compared with non-activated platelets using a HIV-1-sensitive cell line that uses reporter gene constructs to quantify infection (Solomon et al. 2013 ). CXCL4 stimulates neutrophil-endothelial cell attachment and also acts as a co-stimulator of TNF in the release of neutrophil secondary granules (Kasper and Petersen 2011) , as further means of enhancing localized immune cell influx.",

However, dense granule constituents such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (Packham and Rand 2011) , polyphosphates (polyP) (Smith and Morrissey 2014) , and serotonin (Jedlitschky et al. 2012 ) also have immunemodulating properties (Morrell et al. 2014 ). These have not been as well characterized for a role in viral innate immunity as those contained in \u03b1-granules. Nevertheless, the release of platelet dense granule contents by viruses has been investigated in CMV infection. This was mediated by platelet surface TLR2 occupation. Furthermore, inhibition of the ADP receptor, P2Y 12 , identified ADP release as an important trigger for secondary platelet activation (Assinger et al. 2014) . Dendritic cells also express P2Y 12 and their stimulation increases antigen endocytosis and processing (Vanderstocken et al. 2010) , which could involve localized platelet response to pathogen interactions. PolyP induces proinflammatory responses by acting on the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway in vascular endothelial cells (Bae et al. 2012) . PolyP can also interact with chromatin-associated nuclear proteins such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) to amplify proinflammatory responses (Dinarvand et al. 2014) . Because HMGB1 is also secreted by platelets (Maugeri et al. 2012) , polyP warrants continued study as a bridge between platelets and innate immunity, especially in the context of complement, which is suppressed by polyP (Wat et al. 2014 ) and could be a viral survival mechanism.",

This strikingly high correlation suggests mechanisms directly linking the virus to the platelet, such as receptor-mediated binding (Table 1 ). In contrast to viral thrombocytopenia, viral HF (Table 2) is thought to be driven by severe suppression of innate immunity and the resulting cytokine flood that counters systemic virus replication. HF can also result in a reduced platelet count, but through mechanisms indirectly involving platelets, as detailed in excellent reviews elsewhere (Feldmann and Geisbert 2011; Messaoudi and Basler 2015; Zapata et al. 2014) . Here, we overview five primary pathways that simultaneously contribute to viral thrombocytopenia in the absence of HF: decreased thrombopoeisis, direct and indirect virus interactions with platelets and megakaryocytes (tipping the intricate balance between thrombopoeisis and platelet clearance), altered platelet function, and virus-induced immune response against platelets.",

An increase in cell death via apoptosis and decreased megakaryocyte differentiation are probable reasons for reduced platelet production. For example, HIV infection of megakaryocytes resulted in downregulation of the TPO receptor c-Mpl (Gibellini et al. 2013) , causing reduced sensitivity to thrombopoeisis induction. To further investigate this mechanism, umbilical cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells that were induced by TPO toward a megakaryocytic lineage in vitro have been used as a model for HIV infection. The virus surface glycoprotein gp120 interacts with CD4 on these cells (Gibellini et al. 2007) , resulting in specific protein and mRNA changes that elevate TGF-\u03b21 levels and decrease tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 13 (TNFSF13) levels. Both of these effects contribute to inhibition of megakaryocytic proliferation and promote apoptosis (Gibellini et al. 2007 ). Further evidence supporting the concept that viral thrombocytopenia involves attenuated thrombopoiesis comes from an elegant humanized mouse model showing that DENV infection reduces platelet production (Sridharan et al. 2013) . Thus, viral infection has the capacity to reduce thrombopoeisis by direct effects on the megakaryocyte, conceivably involving the same surface receptors for specific viruses that have been identified on platelets and other cells (Tables 1, 2, and 3) .",

In addition to PAR-1 activation by thrombin, IAV can activate platelets through low-affinity Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling (Boilard et al. 2014) . For this to occur, IAV must be decorated with anti-IAV IgG. Crossreactive antibodies resulting from immune recognition of different IAV strains (H1N1 versus H3N2) was sufficient to produce this effect. When wild-type mice (which do not express Fc\u03b3RIIA) and transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3RIIA were challenged intravenously with a sublethal dose of H1N1, there was a drop in circulating platelet count in only the transgenic mice. This indicates that platelet homeostasis is affected by the accessibility of Fc receptors on platelets, supporting the link to pathogenic thrombocytopenia (Boilard et al. 2014) .",

Adenovirus induced thrombocytopenia in wild-type animals but, in sharp contrast, vWF knockout mice were protected from a reduced platelet count (Gupalo et al. 2011 ). Thus, endothelial vWF could contribute in an indirect manner to virus-induced thrombocytopenia by supporting platelet aggregation through interactions with platelet surface GP1b, (the vWF receptor).

Affinity purification of circulating serum immune complexes in HIV patients identified an anti-HIV IgG1 antibody that recognizes amino acid residues 49-66 of the integrin \u03b23 subunit that induces platelet vessiculation (Nardi et al. 2001) . The complement pathway was ruled out in this reaction because neither the F(ab 0 ) 2 fragment of the antibody raised against integrin \u03b23 residues 49-66 in wild-type mice nor treatment with full-length antibody in C3-deficient mice could affect platelet microparticle formation (Nardi et al. 2001 ). Peroxide generation was monitored through the use of an intracellular fluorescent probe and revealed a novel mechanism by which the autoantibody induced damage in platelets through a NADPH oxidase peroxide-generating pathway (Nardi et al. 2001) . Similar outside-in signaling events could be generated by other virus-induced platelet autoantibodies.",

The crossreactivity was found by using the antibody specific for integrin \u03b23 residues 49-66 to screen a phage-display peptide library (Zhang et al. 2009 ). The recognized peptides were then aligned with the viral genome to define similarities. The matched peptides were rationally designed as tools to inhibit the binding of autoantibodies to platelets or to produce platelet antibodies with functional effects (Li et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2009 ). This approach was similarly used to discover molecular mimics in the HIV-1-encoded negative regulatory factor (nef) protein (Li et al. 2005) , both leading toward therapeutic design in virus-induced thrombocytopenia.",

Pairwise sequence alignment analysis programs were used to annotate homologous peptide sequences between DENV NS1 and platelet protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Cheng et al. 2009 ). This tool identified several sequence homologies, of which amino acid residues 311-330 (P311-330) was the most dominant epitope recognized by both anti-NS1 and anti-PDI, as determined by ELISA (Cheng et al. 2009 ). The P311-330 antibodies generated from hyperimmunized mice bound platelet PDI and inhibited both thiol isomerase activity and platelet aggregation induced by ADP (Cheng et al. 2009 ). The presence of anti-platelet autoantibodies with anti-DENV activity in DENV patient sera is associated with thrombocytopenia and the severity of the disease during the acute phase of secondary DENV infection (Saito et al. 2004 ). However, the direct implication of these crossreactive antibodies in DENV pathogenesis has not yet been elucidated. The discovery that platelets can translate and express NS1 (Simon et al. 2015) suggests that viral antibodies might not be crossreactive with platelets, but actually recognize the virus-encoded gene product expressed on the platelet, further complicating vaccine development.",

Examples of an enveloped virus (DENV binding to the co-receptors DC-SIGN and HSP) and a non-enveloped virus (adenovirus binding to CAR) are depicted. This receptor engagement triggers mechanisms that can involve dynamin-dependent engulfment processes, leading to entry into the platelet as an endosomal inclusion. At least for DENV, which has an RNA genome unlike adenoviruses, evidence is accumulating that suggests viral genomic material is released from the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm, where it is translated by platelet ribosomal complexes or used as a template for replication by the virus-encoded polymerase. Other virus-encoded genes contribute to controlling the function of the cell or posttranslational modification of the viral proteins, including proteolytic maturation if the viral genome is organized to produce a polyprotein.",
