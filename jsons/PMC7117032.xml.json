Three different serotypes (DHV-1, DHV-2, and DHV-3) have been described (Gough et al., 1985, Haider and Calnek, 1979). DHV-1 was provisionally classified as an enterovirus (Harvala et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2008), and DHV-3 was classified as a probable picornavirus. DHV-2 is now classified as an astrovirus (Gough et al., 1984, Gough et al., 1987). DHV-1 is distributed worldwide and is one of the most economically important to all duck farms because of the high potential for mortality, while DHV-2 and DHV-3 have only been reported in the UK and the USA, respectively (Ding and Zhang, 2007). The genome of DHV-1 is a single stranded, polyadenylated, positive sense RNA of approximately 7800 nucleotides with a single, long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end of genome.",

Many previous analysis of codon usage have suggested that many different biological factors are related to synonymous codon usage biases, but codon usage variation is represented by two major paradigms (Guo and Yuan, 2009). Either of or both of mutational bias and selection determine codon usage (Zhou and Li, 2009). These observed patterns in synonymous codon usage varied among genes within a genome, and among genomes. Recently, it was reported that codon usage is an important driving force in the evolution of astroviruses and small DNA viruses (Karlin et al., 1990). Clearly, a better knowledge of codon usage bias in the virus is essential to understanding the processes governing their evolution, particularly the overall role played by mutation pressure.",

In addition, some new serotypes of DHV with some features of DHV-1, but with no antigenic relationship with DHV-1 in cross neutralization test, have been reported (Kim et al., 2007).

The lineage A of DHV only contains strains 90D and 04G, which was isolated from Taiwan. Recently, Tseng and Tsai reported strains 90D and 04G were determined to be antigenically unrelated to DHV-1 by in vitro cross-neutralization assay and phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of the two strains revealed that the two strains belong to a novel genus in the Picornaviridae family (Tseng and Tsai, 2007). Moreover, the strains isolated from China and Korea has two different codon usage patterns, this finding reconfirm that more than one genotype of DHV circulated in Korea and China (Fu et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2007, Tseng et al., 2007).
