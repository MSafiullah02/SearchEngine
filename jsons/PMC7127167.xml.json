Nevertheless, there was still substantial room for improvement compared to guideline recommendations.

However, many barriers, such as the allocation of adequate staff time for patient education, adjustment of content to meet individual patients\u2019 needs, and the assessment of learners\u2019 comprehension,30 often exist and make it difficult to implement or document asthma education activities. Similar to other studies,22, 31 our results showed that the majority of patients did not receive asthma education before discharge, and that one in four patients left the ED without instructions on follow-up visit with their primary care provider or prescriptions of oral and inhaled corticosteroids. Using a pre- and post- design, Mackey and colleagues examined the effect of an asthma care map on patient management in the ED and also found inconsistent and infrequent use of the discharge planning section by physicians.28 These findings call for further improvements in providers\u2019 efforts on asthma education and discharge planning in the ED.",

            "text": "Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, without a randomized controlled trial, it would be difficult to assess the possible influence of clinical advances or other system changes on the effects we observed. In the current study, it also was possible that physicians in the prospective study period were aware that they were being evaluated and therefore documented clinical processes more vigorously. Second, all medical charts were reviewed by one chart abstractor who was not blinded to the study hypothesis and the subject status. This is the most common limitation in medical record review studies in emergency medicine32 and could have introduced bias to the study results. To minimize this bias, standard chart abstraction form with clear variable definitions and abstraction guideline was used in the current study. Third, our study cohort was a non-random sample of patients who attended the ED of a tertiary children\u2019s hospital. So our findings may not be generalizable to patients managed in EDs in community setting. Finally, providers may not document all clinical activities in the medical charts, and therefore discrepancies between medical chart review and clinical care provided to patients may exist and could have influenced the validity of chart abstraction data, especially on asthma educational activities.33 However, it has been shown that compared to directly observed care, medical chart review was more accurate on certain key aspects of assessment (e.g., oxygen saturation) and treatment (e.g., oral corticosteroids prescribed at discharge) in the ED.33\n",

Regular updates of the management tool based on the latest guidelines and financial support for its on-going production are key to the sustainability of this strategy. Despite the use of an evidence-based guideline protocol, asthma education and discharge planning at our ED remained unchanged. Strengthening asthma education and discharge planning as suggested by others34, 35, 36 may improve the low follow-up rates with primary care physicians after ED discharge.22, 25. Future efforts should focus on promoting and improving evidence-based practice of these components of asthma management in acute care settings.",
