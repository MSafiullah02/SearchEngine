Patients' demographics are summarized in Table 1. The control group consisted of 200 blood donors from Hong Kong. The study was approved by the Institutional Human Ethics committees of the Prince of Wales Hospital and the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. DNA was extracted from patients' blood samples using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA was extracted from blood samples of blood donors using a standard salting\u2010out procedure (12). Other control groups were Australian blood donors whose Fc\u03b3RIIA or MBL genotypes have been reported in separate studies (5, 13). For Fc\u03b3RIIA genotyping, sequence\u2010specific polymerase chain reaction (SSP) was used to identify the Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010R\u2010H\u2010131 polymorphisms as described previously (7). For MBL2 genotyping, the \u2212 550 (H/L), the \u2212 221 (X/Y) and codon 52Cys, 54Asp, and 57Glu MBL2 polymorphisms were determined in the patients and controls, using the SSP method as described previously (14). Data were analysed for differences in distribution of Fc\u03b3RIIA genotypes among groups using \u03c72\u2010test for linear trend or independence (2 \u00d7 3 contingency tables and \u03c72\u2010analysis). Frequencies of MBL genotype and Fc\u03b3RIIA genotype (e.g. Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010R/R131 vs combined Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010R/H131 and Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010H/H131 or Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010H/H131 vs combined Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010R/H131 and Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010R/R131) as well as the allele frequencies were compared among groups using Fisher's exact test (2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables, two\u2010sided or one\u2010sided as indicated). Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.",

There were no statistically significant differences in Fc\u03b3RIIA genotypes (R/R, R/H and H/H) between the whole SARS patient group and the controls (12, 45 and 43 vs 9, 42 and 49%, respectively). When analysing the SARS subgroups separately, ICU patients with severe outcome of SARS had a significant increase of R/R genotype compared with the controls (23 vs 9%, two\u2010sided P = 0.03). To eliminate the influence of other known risk factor such as co\u2010morbidity, we also evaluated the distributions of Fc\u03b3RIIA genotypes among the SARS patients without underlying illness. Difference in linear trend distribution of the genotypes (R/R, R/H and H/H) was significant between the overall SARS patients without underlying illness and the normal controls (14, 47 and 39 vs 9, 42 and 49%, respectively; P = 0.0419) and between the severe SARS subgroup (ICU plus deceased subgroups) without underlying diseases and the controls (20, 50 and 30 vs 9, 42 and 49%, respectively; P = 0.0178), but a similar distribution of the genotypes among Home subgroup without underlying illness and the controls (12, 46 and 42 vs 9, 42 and 49%, respectively; P = 0.1764) was observed. A significant low H/H was observed among the severe SARS subgroup (ICU plus deceased subgroups) without underlying diseases compared with the controls (30 vs 39%, one\u2010sided P = 0.0388). In comparison with the patients in home, ICU and deceased subgroups, distribution of the genotypes (R/R, R/H and H/H) among these patients without underlying illness was 12, 46 and 42 vs 10, 45 and 45%; 24, 47 and 29 vs 23, 38 and 38%; and 15, 54 and 31 vs 9, 48 and 43%, respectively (Table 2). There was variation at the allele frequency level with the ICU patients having an increased Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010R131 frequency and reduced Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010H131 but not statistically significant compared with the controls and home subgroup of SARS patients (0.42 vs 0.3 and 0.33; 0.58 vs 0.70 and 0.67, respectively).",

Apparently, 54Asp is a predominant variant in Chinese populations (both controls and patients), while only one out of 200 Hong Kong blood donors carries the 52Cys variant.

            "text": "Study of the role of host gene polymorphisms in human diseases, especially how these polymorphisms influence both the susceptibility to diseases and the course of disease development, has been an important area of investigation. Unlike many other genes where genetic variants have no clear functional contribution to a population disease profile, the Fc\u03b3RIIA exhibits a clear functional difference between R131 and H131 allotypes and has relevance for some infectious and autoimmune diseases. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time that Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010R/R131 genotype was significantly associated with severity of SARS infection (P < 0.05). Patient's age is an important prognostic factor influencing survival post SARS infection, because almost half of the deceased, compared to only five out of 159 patients who recovered (home and ICU subgroups), were aged over 70 years (Table 1). However, in both home and ICU patient subgroups in which the majorities were of a younger age group, Fc\u03b3RIIA polymorphisms appear to influence the course of SARS infection. Co\u2010morbidity might have influenced severity of SARS infection, but Fc\u03b3RIIA polymorphisms was still significant as distribution of Fc\u03b3RIIA genotypes was different among the severe SARS patients (when the ICU and deceased patients were amalgamated) after corrections for co\u2010morbidity, compared with the controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients without co\u2010morbidity from both ICU and deceased subgroups displayed a lower frequency of the Fc\u03b3RIIA\u2010H/H131 genotype. Our results suggest that R/R could be a risk factor for developing a more severe course of SARS\u2010Cov infection while H/H might have a protective role in the outcome of SARS infection.",

            "text": "Interestingly, during the SARS outbreak, plasma from convalescent patients who recovered from the SARS infection was used to treat some cases of SARS patients with favourable responses (15, 16). Studies on viral neutralizing activity of anti\u2010SARS plasma have been reported (17, 18), but the functional relevance of antibody against SARS and whether this antibody might work via a Fc\u2010dependent receptor remain to be established. Because activation of Fc\u03b3RIIA is initiated by antibody binding followed by multiple biologic processes such as signal transduction, phagocytosis and antibody\u2010dependent cellular cytotoxicity, release of inflammatory mediators, and interaction with other Fc receptors and complement factors, it would be useful to study the Fc\u03b3RIIA genotypes in parallel with the presence/level of antibody to SARS\u2010Cov in these SARS patients. Additionally, Fc\u03b3RIIA genotyping carried out on patients may help to predict the efficacy of antibody\u2010based immunotherapy in the future.",

Interestingly, MBL genotype profiles are similar between our patients and the Ip group. However, no statistically significant differences between SARS patient groups and controls were observed for the MBL genotypes in our study, despite a higher 54Asp allele frequency found in home subgroup compared with controls or ICU/deceased subgroups. The smaller size of our study group could be the reason why our study did not demonstrate any significant differences in MBL genotypes/haplotypes and susceptibility to SARS\u2010Cov. In comparisons of MBL polymorphisms between Hong Kong blood donors and Australian blood donors and healthy Vietnamese children, 54Asp seems to be a predominant variant in the Chinese population with only one out of 200 (0.5%) Hong Kong blood donors carrying the 52Cys variant (Table 3), while 42% of Australian blood donors carry either the 54Asp or/and the 52Cys, 57Glu variants (13). However, less deficient and more sufficient MBL genotypes were found in Hong Kong blood donors than those in Australian blood donors (P < 0.05), while MBL\u201054 allele frequencies and genotypes in Hong Kong blood donors were similar to those among the Australian blood donors and Vietnamese (Table 4).",
