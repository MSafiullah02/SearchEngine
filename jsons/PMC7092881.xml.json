Briefly, a real-time quantitative RT-PCR was designed in the nsp11 region of the replicase 1B domain of the SARS-CoV genome. A 25 \u03bcl RT-PCR was carried out using 5 \u03bcl of extracted RNA or standard cRNA, 12.5 \u03bcl one-step RT qPCR Mastermix containing ROX as a passive reference (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), 900 nM forward and reverse primers, and 150 nM minor groove binding probe. Amplification and detection were performed in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) under the following conditions: an initial reverse transcription at 48 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min and 45 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C). During amplification, the ABI PRISM sequence detector monitored real-time PCR amplification by quantitative analysis of fluorescence emissions. The reporter dye (FAM) signal was measured against the internal reference dye (ROX) signal to normalize for non-PCR-related fluorescence fluctuations occurring from well to well. The threshold cycle represented the refraction cycle number at which a positive amplification was measured, and was set at 10 times the standard deviation of the mean baseline emission calculated for PCR cycles 3\u201315.",

This time-of-drug-addition assay allows one to obtain a first rough idea about the step in the replication cycle at which the compound exerts its antiviral activity. Besides electron microscopic based information, no data about the growth of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells were available. Our results provide further insights into the SARS-CoV replication cycle. An antiviral compound, which remains its antiviral activity at a time point of 6 h post-infection or later, is not likely to interfere with the attachment, penetration or replication of the genomic RNA, but rather with the processing of viral proteins, assembly or release of the virions.",
