Enzymatic treatment with O-glycosidase of radiolabelled virions under different ionic conditions, to allow for possible alternative exposure of glycosidic enzyme cleavage sites, did not alter the specific infectivity of virions re-isolated after rate-zonal centrifugation in glycerol gradients. As an alternative method to assess the significance of carbohydrates in IPNV integrity, periodate oxidation in the presence of an aldehyde quencher was chosen. Following re-isolation of viruses, a 3-5 10 log-unit reduction in specific infectivity was revealed and, at higher concentrations, a total disruption or virion aggregation was observed. The loss of infectivity of intact virions was not because of a lack of attachment to cells. Additionally, re-evaluation of reading values from UV-spectra of purified IPNV yielded a specific infectivity of 3 \u00b7 10 11 TCID 50 -units mg )1 of protein and a ratio of 40 virions per TCID 50unit in the CHSE-214 cell system.",

            "text": "Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), the type species of the genus Aquabirnavirus within the family Birnaviridae, is composed of a single-shelled capsid enclosing two linear segments of doublestranded RNA (Dobos 1995) . The larger segment A encodes a polyprotein containing a protease, VP4, that auto-catalytically liberates the two structural proteins, the precursor of the coat protein VP2 (Duncan, Nagy, Krell & Dobos 1987) and the core protein VP3 (Hjalmarsson, Carlemalm & Everitt 1999) . A second overlapping open reading frame encodes a protein denoted VP5, the role of which is not yet fully understood (Hong, Gong & Wu 2002; Santi, Sandtr\u00f8, Sindre, Song, Hong, Thu, Wu, Vakharia & Evensen 2005b; Santi, Song, Vakharia & Evensen 2005a) . The viral polymerase, and likewise the genome-linked primer, is encoded by segment B (Dobos 1995) . IPNV is a serious pathogen and threat to the commercial aquaculture industry and continues to spread into new fish farms causing substantial economic losses (Rodriguez Saint-Jean, Borrego & Perez-Prieto 2003) . When first isolated, IPNV was considered to be a reovirus based on the nature of the viral genome (Moss & Gravell 1969) , but further insights into virion structure placed it within a new taxonomic family (Dobos, Hill, Hallett, Kells, Becht & Teninges 1979) that was approved by the ICTV in 1986 (Brown 1986) . When quantifying the amount of purified IPNV in solution by UV readings, the relationship originally determined for reoviruses is still employed, despite differences in protein and nucleic acid composition (Smith, Zweerink & Joklik 1969; Dobos, Hallett, Kells, Sorensen & Rowe 1977; Dobos et al. 1979) .",

This ability could be a reflection of the concept of metastability, referring to the property of viral capsids to remain intact and protect the viral genome during the extracellular phase until entry into a susceptible cell where subsequent uncoating is pivotal for virus replication. Documented factors influencing virion integrity are fluctuations in temperature, ionic concentration and pH (Witz & Brown 2001; Johnson 2003) . IPNV entry occurs via receptormediated endocytosis (Couve, Kiss & Kuznar 1992; Kuznar, Soler, Farias & Espinoza 1995; Granzow, Weiland, Fichtner & Enzmann 1997) , but unlike many other viruses, it does not require an acidic pH to exit the endosome (Espinoza & Kuznar 1997) .",

            "text": "The majority of glycosylated proteins carry N-linked glycosylation, a post-translational modification that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Less abundant are structural viral proteins with an O-linked modification. However, the adenovirus fibre, responsible for cellular recognition and attachment (Philipson, Lonberg-Holm & Pettersson 1968; Ishibashi & Maizel 1974) and the coat protein of IPNV, VP2 are both glycosylated in an O-linked fashion (Hjalmarsson et al. 1999) . The significance of this post-translational modification of the replicative cycle of IPNV is not known. The M protein of the envelope of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus is invariably O-glycosylated, and it is not important for virulence or replication (de Haan, de Wit, Kuo, Montalto, Masters, Weiss & Rottier 2002) . The multifaceted large T-antigen of the polyomavirus SV40, essential for viral gene regulation and expression, is O-glycosylated in the region important for the nuclear localization signal, retinoblastoma recognition and viral replication (Medina, Grove & Haltiwanger 1998; Ahuja, Saenz-Robles & Pipas 2005) . O-glycosylated nucleocytoplasmic proteins have also been implemented in signal transduction events and as such would influence protein-protein interactions (Wells, Vosseller & Hart 2001) . This raises an interesting question on the possible functional interplay between mutual phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. In view of the broad spectrum of the events dependent on O-linked glycosylation, it would be of interest to investigate whether the O-linked glycosylation in IPNV has any impact on, e.g. virion stability and viral infectivity.",

However, this latter method is laborious and time-consuming, and it is not used on a routine basis. The protein contents of six separate pools of purified IPNV were based on spectrophotometric measurements (Kalb & Bernlohr 1977) and the chemical assay (Dorsey et al. 1977) and concordant results were obtained. Thus, a comparison of such UV-data, from 20 separate virus pools, with data obtained by the relationship described by Smith et al. (1969) yielded reproducibly a 3.15 AE 0.16 (SD) times higher protein content value according to the former method.

An initial series of experiments was performed where freshly prepared, double-radiolabelled IPNV was transferred from CsCl into a TNE buffer system and stored in this buffer at 4\u00b0C (Dobos et al. 1979) . Prior to enzyme treatment, virions were transferred into 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, according to the man-ufacturer\u00d5s protocol and then separately subjected to the enzymes PNGase F (a negative control with no expected effect), or neuraminidase followed by O-glycosidase (NA/O series). Following these treatments, virions were sedimented in glycerol gradients under calculated conditions where intact virions would migrate to the centre of the tubes. As controls of sedimentation, starting material in TNE and virions mock-treated only in the phosphate buffer were also included. The sedimentation profiles showed that mere transfer of virions into the acidic phosphate buffer (mock series) and the prolonged incubation at 37\u00b0C caused the virions to disassemble as revealed by some aggregates sedimenting onto the high-density cushion and also leaving slowly migrating capsid components on top of the gradients (Fig. 1) . It also became apparent that virions stored in TNE spontaneously disaggregated as revealed by slowly sedimenting material of low molecular weight remaining on top of the gradients (Fig. 1d) . Such material contained both RNA and protein of approximately the same relative amounts as in intact virions and would correspond to released core structures and capsid proteins (Hjalmarsson et al. 1999) . Infectivity titrations were performed on pooled fractions from the virion positions in the middle of the gradients as well as from aggregated material. The same amounts of radioactivity from all series were assayed, and infectivity yields of the enzyme-treated series were compared with the TNE control and the mock series. Only minor differences were revealed, indicating no effect of the O-glycosidase and as anticipated also a lack of effect in the negative control series. Among the aggregates, some infectivity was detected; however, only for the negative control series. Thus, any O-glycosidic enzyme effect on virion stability and viral infectivity could not be deduced from this type of experimental set-up.",

The sedimentation profiles displayed symmetrical peaks of virions migrating 50% into the gradients and with some aggregates accumulating on the cushions in both series (not shown).

Therefore, it was important to keep radiolabelled viruses intact and infectious under storage conditions at 4\u00b0C because we wanted to avoid freezing and thawing of the virus. To investigate this further, an alternative buffer system was developed. Equal amounts of freshly purified IPNV in CsCl were directly transferred into two different buffer systems, TNE and a stabilizing SB-buffer, by employing the Zeba\u00d4 Desalt Spin Column technique. The samples were subjected to 10 cycles of freeze-thawing; after each step, aliquots were removed for UVspectrum analysis, and after steps 2, 7 and 10, samples were withdrawn for infectivity titration. UV-spectra revealed constant and overlapping profiles for virions maintained in the SB system, whereas data for virions in TNE fluctuated, indi-cating difficulties in removing representative 2 lL samples for spectrometry because of possible freezethawing-induced aggregation (not shown). Infectivity titration data showed that after the tenth freezing, the infectivity dropped by four orders of magnitude for viruses in TNE, whereas in the SBsystem infectivity was essentially maintained and was reduced only by a factor of approximately 5.5 (Fig. 2) . However, as a novel observation, virions retained stability and infectivity for prolonged periods of time at 4\u00b0C in SB as compared with the conventional TNE buffer system (compare Fig. 1d ).",

As a control of mere buffer treatments, a mock-treated sample was included together with the starting material kept in SB. Both glycerol ratezonal and CsCl isodensity centrifugations were run as described before. The sedimentation profiles of the former showed that only minor amounts of aggregates had formed and that virions migrated to the expected middle position of the centrifuge tubes Figure 2 Infectivity titrations of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus in the TNE-and stabilizing buffer-buffer systems following the cycles of freeze-thawing (F-T).

In the equilibrium density gradients, virions were recovered as distinct and symmetrical peaks in the centre of the tubes and neither aggregation nor disruption of the virions could be seen (not shown). Apparently, virions stored in 5% glycerol prior to transfer into the low-ionicstrength phosphate buffer protected the virions from spontaneously falling apart by the buffer treatment. Such stabilizing effect was particularly evident upon the isodensity centrifugation in CsCl.

            "text": "During our initial studies on IPNV stability, we noticed that metabolically radiolabelled virions of IPNV freshly prepared in the established TNE buffer system (Chang, Macdonald & Yamamoto 1978; Dobos et al. 1979 ) displayed totally unpredictable stability properties as revealed by both ratezonal centrifugation and by viewing in the electron microscope. These observations were consistent throughout the studies when virus preparations were stored in the TNE buffer system. Furthermore, a total disaggregation of purified virions of IPNV is provoked by dialysis against buffers of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 and 0.2 mm EDTA (Hjalmarsson et al. 1999) . This behaviour could be a reflection of the biological fact that most nonenveloped viruses are characterized by their properties of metastability (Witz & Brown 2001; Johnson 2003) . The human adenovirus type 2 further exemplifies the fragility of purified nonenveloped viruses. This virus disrupts readily upon dialysis against hypotonic buffers of pH < 6.5 (Prage, Pettersson, H\u00f6glund, Lonberg-Holm & Philipson 1970 ). This effect is partially counteracted by physiological concentrations of sodium chloride and it is almost fully inhibited in the presence of any protein, such as bovine serum albumin, that non-specifically adheres to the virions. Interestingly, because of hydrophobic interactions, these protective effects are further enhanced in the presence of non-ionic detergents such as Tween 20 (Everitt, de Luca & Blixt 1992) . Not only the property to completely disaggregate under small changes of the environmental conditions in vitro should be considered -as seen here -but also the possibility of \u00d4particle breathing\u00d5, meaning slight conformational changes of the whole virion leading to the exposure of different immunological epitopes and otherwise hidden structural residues because of changes in pH and ionic strength of buffers. Such virion behaviour is seen in the poliovirus system where the N-terminal region of VP1 under certain conditions is retained at the interior of the capsid as revealed by X-ray crystallography, whereas infectious virus in suspension can be precipitated by antibodies against the N-terminal part (Roivainen, Piirainen, Rysa, Narvanen & Hovi Figure 5 Compilation of data from five separate rate-zonal centrifugation analyses of periodate-treated virions of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus. One series of 3 H-mannose-labelled (Exp. 1) and four series of 3 H-amino acid-labelled (Exp. #2-5) viruses were treated with sodium periodate as indicated and analysed as described in Materials and methods. The relative distribution of radioactivity recovered as distinct peaks or regions in each gradient is shown as columns in the figure. As an example of sedimentation, the radioactivity profile of experiment #5 is shown in Fig. 4 . The following periodate concentrations were not tested: in exp. #1; 10, 25, 50 mm NaIO4, in exp. #2; 5 mm NaIO4, in exp. #3; 25 and 50 mm NaIO4 and in exp. #4; 50 mm. 1993). Further, electron microscopy of polioviruses stained with phosphotungstic acid under different temperatures and ionic concentrations displays altered diameters of the capsid, which in turn are mirrored by different periods of time needed for the chemical agent N-acetyl-ethyleneimine to penetrate and inactivate the virus (Burrage, Kramer & Brown 2000) . The entry mechanisms of non-enveloped viruses are still quite elusive. Many non-enveloped viruses have an internal structure, often an integral part of the capsid protein, which is referred to as a membrane-active peptide. It has the equivalent function of the fusion peptides in enveloped viruses with the difference that the former cause membrane disruption to allow for virion entry and/or a simultaneous uncoating instead of membrane fusion. This membrane-active protein is hidden during the extracellular phase and needs to be activated in some viral systems by a cleavage event (Zhang, Jin, Fang, Hui & Zhou 2010) , and it is exposed during the early phase of infection induced by receptor binding or alterations in the physical environment such as temperature, ionic strength or a lowering of pH (Banerjee & Johnson 2008) . To a certain degree, these conformational changes are reversible and account for the observed \u00d4capsid breathing\u00d5. A membrane-active domain responsible for membrane destabilization with subsequent entry and uncoating has not been identified for IPNV, but it is likely that such an activity would be located to VP2. It is possible that the observed virion instability in TNE could induce such \u00d4capsid breathing\u00d5 exposing a membrane destabilizing part of VP2. Further studies are needed to verify if this is the case and to identify the mechanism that allows IPNV to escape the endosomal vesicles and release the viral genome.",

However, as the buffer subsequently required for optimal O-glycosidase enzymatic activity called for a change into the lowionic-strength phosphate buffer of low pH, the SB had to be replaced prior to enzymatic exposure of virions. The Zeba\u00d4 desalt spin columns were employed for quantitative and rapid recovery of samples, and using unlabelled virions in the presence of 3 H-labelled glycerol, it was shown that with a starting concentration of 5% glycerol in the SB system, the eluted sample would contain a maximum of 0.003% glycerol and now in the alternative buffer. Interestingly, virions that were transiently exposed to glycerol and then transferred to 50 mm phosphate buffer fully retained particle stability even at the extreme ionic strength conditions upon rebanding to equilibrium in CsCl (1.33 g mL )1 of CsCl = 43% w/v) (Chang et al. 1978) .",

Thus, apart from following the manufacturer\u00d5s recommendations, the idea was also that at this low-ionicstrength condition some sort of \u00d4capsid breathing\u00d5 could be induced, thereby exposing alternative sites for the O-glycosidase treatment.

However, in this virus system, the level of glycosylation is extremely low (Hjalmarsson et al. 1999) and no such branched carbohydrates would be anticipated. Taken together, O-glycosidase treatments of intact virions, irrespective of the ionic strength of the environment, did not affect stability properties or reduce the infectivity of recovered virions of IPNV. Moreover, only one enzyme is available that specifically targets O-linked glycosidic carbohydrates. The O-glycosidase employed here releases Ser-and Thr-linked b-Gal-(1 fi 3)-a-GalNAc from glycoproteins. The glycosidic bonds connecting the carbohydrate moieties to VP2 could be of the type that cannot be recognized by the present O-glycosidase.",

The interpretation of all these experiments is that carbohydrate residues were not exposed on the intact virion to the extent or in such a way that enzymes could not recognize the O-linkage to the protein moiety of the VP2 capsomere, nor could free lectins bind in such a way that infectivity could be blocked or virions become aggregated.",

The lack of enzymatic effect on intact virions, as also seen by the full recognition of VP2 in subsequent lectin blots (not shown), prompted us to employ the established method of chemical oxidation of carbohydrate residues by treatment with periodate. Periodate oxidizes adjacent hydroxyl groups on carbohydrates without affecting the proteins at low pH (Woodward, Young & Bloodgood 1985; Martinez-Barragan & del Angel 2001) . However, a possible effect on the amino acid residues, e.g. serine, threonine and cysteine cannot be totally excluded (Dreesman & Suriano 1976; Shraishi, Shirachi, Ishida & Sekine 1978) . Perio-date oxidation of adenovirus types 7 and 14 reduces the haemagglutinating activity against rhesus monkey red blood cells with a parallel loss of infectivity (Dreesman & Suriano 1976; Ogier et al. 1994) . Likewise, a reduction in infectivity of more than six orders of magnitude is seen upon periodate treatment of adenovirus type 5 (Ogier et al. 1994) . The periodate oxidation of adenovirus type 5 specifically targets the O-glycosylated fibre, but virus is still able to attach and enter permissive cells. The mechanism behind the reduction in infectivity is suggested to be the action of produced formaldehyde resulting in cross-links between the DNA and viral proteins (Ogier et al. 1994) . Similarly, the murine cytomegalovirus is instantly inactivated by periodate, with a reduction in infectivity by 6 10 log units. However, the virus remains immunogenic resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies in infected mice (Geoffroy, Moachon, Rodwell & Quash 1996) . In our studies, we have introduced the amino acid glycine as a source of primary amino groups to possibly quench the action of exposed/ released formaldehyde following the oxidative cleavage of carbohydrates. By this, we believe that the monitored effects of chemical oxidation should be a primary consequence of carbohydrate cleavage.",

The reduction in infectivity by 3-5 orders of magnitude was not a consequence of an impaired level of virus-cell attachment, but would rather reflect interference with the steps of internalization, uncoating or events further on in the replicative cycle. Higher concentrations of periodate, between 10 and 50 mm, more drastically affected virion integrity as seen by disassembly and/or formation of aggregates. We therefore suggest that the low level of O-linked glycosylation of IPNV is important for maintaining virion integrity and infectivity.",

Purified IPNV, metabolically radiolabelled with 32 P-orthophosphate and 3 H-amino acids was stored in the stabilizing buffer (SB) system. Prior to enzymatic treatment virions (12.5 lg per sample) were transferred into 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5.(a) Mocktreated series, (b) virus treated with neuraminidase followed by O-glycosidase (NA/O), (c) virus treated with PNGase F (PNGF) as a negative control and (d) starting material maintained in SB. Sedimentation was from right to left.virus-cell attachment investigations showed that the dramatic reduction in infectivity upon periodate treatment was not because of the inhibition of attachment as the values of actual attachment for three periodate-treated samples were all in the same range as the corresponding controls and the mean figures -contrary to what might have been expected -actually exceeded the mean values of the control series by approximately 10%.",
