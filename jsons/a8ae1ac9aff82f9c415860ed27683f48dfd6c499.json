            "text": "Respiratory tract infections remain the top cause of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases worldwide [1] . The emergence of new pathogens that cause lethal human respiratory illnesses with pandemic potential [2, 3] pose major challenges and rapidly focus the attention of global public health authorities and HCWs. Two zoonotic coronaviruses which cause lethal respiratory tract infections in humans feature on the WHO Blueprint list of priority pathogens for research and development [4] because of their pandemic potential. The first human case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection which was first reported from Guangdong province China [5] , and that of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2012 [5] . In January 2020, another novel zoonotic coronavirus that causes lethal human disease, SARS-CoV-2, was included on the WHO priority Blueprint list [4] . This followed the appearance in December 2019 of a case cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in China [6] [7] [8] . The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) epidemiological investigations implicated the source as Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [6] . The China CDC took prompt action instituting public health measures including intensive surveillance, epidemiological investigations, and closure of the market on 1 January 2020. A novel coronavirus was identified from patients' samples using whole-genome sequencing [8, 9] and was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now renamed as SARS-CoV-2 [10] . The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is abbreviated as COVID-19 (COrona-VIrus Disease-2019).",

A specific molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 was developed [13] and a flurry of investigations and research on COVID-19 outbreak rapidly defined the epidemiological, virologic, and clinical features and provided evidence of humanto-human transmission in community, household, and hospital settings [6, [8] [9] [10] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . These have guided the development of numerous WHO guidelines and recommendation documents related to case definitions, reporting of cases, diagnosis, management, prevention, and control guideline documents [10] . The rapid spread occurring within China despite a 'lock down' of Wuhan resulted in numerous chains of transmission [6, 10, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , and spread of the virus was facilitated by national and international travel during the January New Year holiday period [20] . The appearance of novel zoonotic diseases is never without controversies [21] [22] [23] . Reports of conspiracy theories for the source and sudden appearance of the virus have been negated by phylogenetic studies using sequences of SARS-CoV2-19 obtained from early cases [8, 9] , which indicate that the novel virus may have been introduced to human populations from the animal kingdom in November 2019 or December 2019 [21] . As with SARS-CoV [24] and MERS-CoV [25] , defining the actual zoonotic source and mode of primary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans remains an enigma, and requires urgent study through ONE-HEALTH collaborations [23] .",

COVID-19 appears to replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract [14, 26] and appears to cause less abrupt onset of symptoms, which are similar to conventional human coronaviruses that are a major cause of common colds and URTIs in the winter seasons. Furthermore, during the prodrome and early phase of disease, the upper respiratory tract appears to have large quantity of virus and may be responsible for the rapid person to person spread [26] . In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, whereas accurate data are unavailable, the highest viral loads were seen in seriously ill patients. This has implications on infection control measures.

A study of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Several studies [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] show that symptoms of COVID-19 patients are similar to MERS and SARS and fever (92-98%), dry cough (75-82%), fatigue (69-75%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (20-40%) were the most common clinical manifestations. A wide spectrum of clinical disease is being seen from asymptomatic, subclinical, mild, and selflimiting disease to severe disease and ARDS among older people or those with other comorbid diseases such as diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension, with men are more likely to die than women. Several of these patients have negative rtPCR tests.

Although the world awaits the development and evaluation of new vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs, antibody, and/or other host-directed interventions [32, 33] , public health infection control measures remain of prime importance in limiting human-to-human transmission, especially among close contacts and HCWs, and minimizing risk of international spread by identifying and isolating patients early. However, several questions remain to be answered for optimal infection control measures and management of COVID-19 patients in hospitals: How to limit spread to HCWs especially in light of reports of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infection? What is the impact of quarantine after exposure and does this reduces the spread of SARS-CoV-2, or does this add to the risk for those who are quarantined? What are the risks of noninvasive ventilation in COVID-19 patients to HCWs, and when should we intubate and how can we minimize risks to those who do the intubation? What is the role for steroids and of combination antiviral agents for severe lung disease and will they be helpful or harmful? What are the roles for a range of potential host-directed therapies such as cellular therapy with allogeneic stromal cells or repurposed drugs, biologics, convalescent plasma, and combination of antiviral agents for COVID-19 patients with ARDS [33] .",

Recurring mass gathering religious, sporting, and other events attract people from across all continents increasing the risk of spread of aerosol transmissible respiratory tract infections, and for this year's events, event organizers should be on alert for both lethal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-2 [34] .",

Only time will tell. In the interim it is critical that although COVID-19 requires intense public health, scientific and political attention currently, the current media hype on the novel COVID-19 outbreak should not detract the attention of health services, frontline physicians, and other HCWs from other respiratory tract infections (RTIs), which cause over 5 million deaths globally annually. This volume of COPM highlights current opinions and new developments on several important issues related the diagnosis, management and prevention of community acquired pneumonia, bacterial and viral RTIs [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] .",
