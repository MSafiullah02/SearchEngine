Following an options appraisal that considered resource and potential risks/benefits, the current NIPCM literature review methodology was revised and a two-person systematic methodology was introduced. The twoperson methodology is more closely aligned to the methods of internationally recognised guideline producers and the NIPCM literature reviews will be produced to this methodology in the future. This article describes the processes involved in both the single and two-person NIPCM methodologies and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in comparison with other relevant guidance developer's methods.",

A summary comparison of the two methods is shown in table 3. The majority of the currently published reviews have been produced using the single-person methodology. Reviews that are scheduled for update will typically be produced using the two-person methodology.

In all cases these specialist groups had oversight at key stages of the guideline development such as scoping, developing research questions and search strategies, developing recommendations and sign-off on the final guideline. The NIPC steering and consensus groups perform these roles for the NIPCM. A key difference compared to other guideline developers is that the NIPC steering group does not disband, therefore no additional time is required to recruit expert stakeholders to perform this function; there is also the benefit of organisational memory as all members are well versed in the process for developing the NIPCM and the content of the chapters.

First and second screening of articles is carried out by two reviewers independently in all methodologies with the exception of the NIPCM single-reviewer methodology. The processes for data extraction, appraisal and summarising are more varied; WHO, SHEA, SIGN and epic guidelines all use at least two independent reviewers to carry out these tasks, [9,10,12,14e16] whereas HICPAC, NICE and NIPCM methodologies all use a single reviewer with either a full or partial check by a second. [5, 11, 13] All methods use a defined process or tool to critically appraise the evidence identified; the GRADE system is used by WHO, NICE and HICPAC; [9, 11] SIGN have their own system of critical appraisal tools and their methodology is also accredited by NICE; [12] both NIPCM [5] and epic guidelines [14e16] use AGREE [7] and SIGN [6] methods for appraisal of other guidelines and published literature, respectively. SHEA have their own checklist for appraising the quality of studies, however, its use is only suggested and it is not a requirement of the process. [10] With the exception of HICPAC the development of recommendations in all methodologies is guided by evidence summaries produced by those carrying out the literature review. These recommendations are then agreed by the guideline development/steering/expert group either with, [10, 13, 17] or without [9, 11,14e16 ] a process of targeted or open external consultation. When the single-and two-person NIPCM methodologies are compared the major difference is in the selection and appraisal of evidence, all other elements are the same; since no other guideline developer considered here uses a single-person methodology the two-person NIPCM methodology is likely to be the most acceptable to guideline consumers.",

HICPAC guidelines are to be revised periodically, however, it is not clear how or if this is achieved. [11] The timeframe for updating SIGN guidelines varies by topic. [12] NICE guidelines are checked every 5 years at a minimum. The epic guidelines stated that the guidelines would be updated within a two-year timeframe, however, there were gaps of 6 and 7 years between the epic and epic2 and epic2 and epic3, respectively. [14e16,18] The NIPCM literature reviews have a considerably shorter timeframe for producing recommendations. Initial reviews carried out using the two-person systematic review methodology can be expected to take 4e6 months from scoping to publication, an update of these reviews would take up to 3 months but each reviewer would be working on around three reviews at a time i.e. publishing three per quarter. This enables a complete update of all NIPCM literature reviews to be carried out every three years. These three yearly updates are in addition to ad hoc minor changes as a result of stakeholder feedback or publication of new evidence which necessitates a change to practice.",

The ethos underpinning the NIPCM is to make IPC practice guidelines accessible to all care staff that supports a common understanding; making it easy to do the right thing, every time, for every patient, in every care area. This once for Scotland (and Wales) approach not only promotes collaboration and engagement, releasing IPCT time to improve staff knowledge and patient confidence in the eradication of avoidable infections, but has helped Scotland to align practice with educational resources, monitoring, quality improvement and scrutiny.",

It is therefore essential that other sources of bias are controlled at all other stages of guideline development e.g. through wide consultation with stakeholders and topic experts. In describing the single-and two-person methodologies for producing the NIPCM and comparing these to the methods of other major guideline producers we hope to have demonstrated that both methodologies have a low risk of bias and are able to produce recommendations that are risk-based, proportionate, practical and in a format that is applicable and accessible to all care staff.",

The NIPCM literature reviews are living literature reviews i.e. they are updated in real time in response to changes in evidence and/or practice, this is in addition to a three-year update cycle and so work on these is continuous. When literature reviews for guidelines are outsourced and/or require substantial additional funding and personnel to carry them out it is difficult if not impossible to maintain this level of activity. Unlike most other guideline developers, the NIPC steering group does not stand down or disband after production of a new or updated literature review and so there is no need to convene a new committee/working group for each piece of guidance. The NIPCM is supported by a permanent full-time team of scientists, infection prevention and control nurses and support staff with ring-fenced funding, therefore, the time taken by other organisations to source funding, recruit reviewers and experts is circumvented.",

The two-person methodology is the 'gold standard' to which we aspire, therefore it is intended that all of the NIPCM literature reviews will be repeated using the NIPCM twoperson methodology. It is planned that this work will be completed by the end of 2021, however, it is not possible to predict what new challenges may arise in this time e.g. emerging infection threats such as novel coronavirus which take precedence and may divert resource, and it is possible that this may take several years. In the interim however, there should be no concern regarding the methods used to produce the existing single-person literature reviews or the resulting recommendations within the NIPCM.",
