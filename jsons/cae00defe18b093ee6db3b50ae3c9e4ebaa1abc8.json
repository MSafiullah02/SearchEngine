Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150 WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s). To our knowledge, this is the first report on WES and COVID-19. Our results suggest a combined model for COVID-19 susceptibility with a number of common susceptibility genes which represent the favorite background in which additional host private mutations may determine disease progression.",

A reasonable hypothesis is that at the basis of these different outcomes there are host predisposing genetic factors leading to different immunogenicity/cytokine responses as well as specific receptor permissiveness to virus and antiviral defence [3] [4] [5] [6] . Similarly, during the study of host genetics in influenza disease, a pattern of genetic markers has been identified which underlies increased susceptibility to a more severe clinical outcome (as reviewed in [7] ). This hypothesis is also supported by a recent work reporting 50% heritability of COVID-19 symptoms [8] .",

Therefore, we analyzed our cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. According to the \"pathogenic\" definition in ClinVar database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), for each patient, we identified an average of 1 mutated gene involved in viral infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s) or a carrier status of rare disorders (Fig. 1) . Following the pipeline used in routine clinical practice for WES analysis in rare disorders we then moved forward checking for rare variants \"predicted'' to be relevant for infection by the means of common annotation tools. We thus identified an average of additional 1-5 variants per patient which summed up to the previous identified pathogenic variants (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S3 ).",

ZNF717 variations were detected in more than 10% of the WGS samples in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [22] where it has been identified as a potential driver gene with high frequency mutations at both single-cell and population levels. Moreover, this gene is one of the most recurrent somatically mutated genes in gastric cancer, together with TP53 [23] .

Moreover, NO production may facilitate virus mutations and selection of more resistant strains. However, it seems that NO may have different effects according to causative agents. Notably, few studies demonstrated that NO was able to significantly reduce viral infection and replication of SARS-CoV through two distinct mechanisms: impairment of the fusion between the spike protein and its receptor ACE2, and reduction of viral RNA production [46] . Very few data are currently available on NO specific effects in COVID-19. The promising results reported in SARS-CoV infection may suggest a similar effectiveness also in COVID-19, considering that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 share more than 70% of RNA sequence and have shown similar mechanisms of infection and viral replication. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of inhaled NO in COVID-19 patients: although inhaled NO is conceived as a vasodilator therapy and therefore is indicated for the optimization of ventilation/perfusion mismatch in intubated patients, the results may be helpful to elucidate its potential antiviral properties [47, 48] .",

[64] , which provides an estimate of the likelihood that the variant has deleterious functional effects (i.e. variants more likely to have a functional effect contribute more to the score). The sum in equation (1) was performed over all the variants in the gene where the DANN score was available. Genes with less than 5 annotated variants were discarded from the analysis. The scores calculated by equation (1) were ranked for all the samples, and the sum of the ranking for the COVID-19 samples, named , was calculated. Then, sample labels were permuted 10.000 times, and these permutations were used to estimate the average value and the standard deviation of under the nullhypothesis. The p-value was calculated assuming a normal distribution for the sum of the ranking [65] .",

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects in Italy have reached the threshold of 200.000 cases, and we are now experiencing the long awaited descent of viral spread. Since the beginning of the epidemic wave, one of the first observations has been a highly heterogeneous phenotypic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals. Indeed, while most affected subjects show mild symptoms, a subset of patients develops severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation with a 20% of cases requiring hospitalization; 5% of cases admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and ~2.5% requiring intensive support with ventilators or extracorporeal oxygenation (ECMO) machines [1].

Our data demonstrate an inverse correlation (p-value 2.13911369444695E-14 and Adj p-value 1.53930621452403E-10) between the OR4C5 mutation burden and COVID-19 status suggesting that \"resurrected'' functional alleles of OR4C5 are susceptibility alleles for COVID-19 infection. Each sensory cell expresses a single allele of a single OR locus, thus transmitting a molecularly defined signal to the brain. It is known that the olfactory bulb is a critical immunosensory effector organ that effectively clears viruses. After the infection, the neuroepithelium triggers nitric oxide (NO) and major histocompatibility antigens (MHC) activation which starts innate immunity [17]. The entry of the virus into neuroepithelial cells induces the activation of microglia/macrophages which are involved in the phagocytic process, clinically corresponding to Hypo(an)osmia. This response is essential during the initial stages of infection and blocks the virus access to the CNS [18].",

Several rare variants in Interleukins (ILs) and Interleukins receptors (ILRs) are found. Interleukins are crucial in modulating immune response against all types of infective agents.

IL16 is a pleiotropic cytokine chemotactic for T cells and able to modulate lymphocyte activation. IL-16 in HIV infection seems to inhibit virus replication [51].

Mutations in this gene, including those identified in our cohort, are associated with autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis (OMIM#167800) [52]. MBL2 encodes a mannose-binding lectin (MBL) secreted by the liver as part of the acute-phase response and involved in innate immune defense. Its deficiency causes increased susceptibility to infections, possibly due to a negative impact on the ability to mount an immune response [53,54]. MBL2 deficiency has also been suggested to be a susceptibility factor for vascular disease [55]. IRGM plays a role in autophagy and control of intracellular mycobacteria [56]. Autophagy plays relevant roles in many processes, including innate and adaptive immunity and antimicrobial defense. Accordingly, alterations in IRGM regulation affect the efficacy of autophagy and are considered relevant contributing factors in chronic inflammatory diseases, including Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD; OMIM#612278) [57].
