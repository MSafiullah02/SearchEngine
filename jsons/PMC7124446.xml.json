            "text": "Lectins are non-immune origin glycoproteins having tremendous applications in analytical biochemistry as well as in pharmacology [1]. Initially, lectins were characterised as hemagglutinins due to their ability to agglutinate either human or rabbit erythrocytes [2]. They are found in all living organisms (bacteria, fungus, plant, and animal) [3] and are mainly involved in carbohydrate recognition with various applications in immunology, glycoproteins purification, virology, cytochemistry and cell biology [2], [4], [5], [6], [7]. In plants, they are expressed in all parts and are extracted from seeds, bulbs, leaves, fruits, roots, and flowers [8], [9], [10], [11]. Due to their diverse role in plants such as storage of proteins [12], protection from insects [13], cell wall propagation [14], a carrier for sugar moieties [15] and mitogenic stimulation [16], lectins have been explored more in detail over the last couple of years. Besides their biological activities plant lectins are also used for diagnostics purpose of various diseases, and widely used in drug delivery systems [17]. Several lectins also act as antiviral agents such as concavalin A, musa acuminate lectin, narcissus pseudonarcissusu lectin and many more [18], [19]. Mannose specific lectin isolated from plant showed anti-corona viral activity which is an acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus [20].",

Lectins have been characterised from various plant families like Solanaceae, Rosaceae, Malavaceae and Leguminceae [21]. However, lectin from Liliaceae, Asparagaceae, Iridiaceae and other plant families have not been studied much in details and therefore it is necessary to characterise new lectins from these classes of plants [22]. Hyacinth lily is a bulbous monocotyledon plant that belongs to the family of Asparagaceae and subfamily Scilloideae. In literature some reports on few small molecules like carbohydrate, alkaloids from this plant exist, however the functions of these molecules are not clear and there is strong evidence that these molecules may play significant role in plant defence system.",

            "text": "In the present study, lectin was successfully purified from hyacinth lily bulbs which belong to the family Asparagaceae. This is the first report on lectin from hyacinth plant. Lectin was purified using a combination of an ion exchange chromatography DEAE and gel filtration chromatography sephadex G-75. Purified hyacinth lectin showed hemagglutination activity towards rabbit erythrocytes with titter value of hemagglutination observed up to 0.06 mg/mL. Purified lectin was found to be a glycoprotein as determined by PAS staining whereas carbohydrate content of lectin was observed up to 5.2%. Similar carbohydrate contents of lectin have been reported in case of lectin purified from Artocarpus integerifolia and Clathrotropis nitida\n[34] Hemagglutination activity of hyacinth lectin was inhibited by mannose and ovalbumin which suggested that its manose binding lectin which is one of the significant properties of lectin purified from monocotyledon plants. Hyacinth lectin showed moderate temperature and pH stability. It is stable up to 60 \u00b0C and started to lose hemagglutination activity after heating above 60 \u00b0C. It maintained 50% hemagglutination activity upto 70 \u00b0C while above 70 \u00b0C it did not showed any activity. Similar pattern of stability of lectin was shown in case of Colocasia esculenta, Crinum latifolium\n[38]. Hyacinth lectin is stable over wide a range of pH from 4 to 12. Hemagglutination activity of hyacinth lectin is maximum in the range of pH 6\u20138 while in lower pH 4 its hemagglutination activity decreased upto 50% in higher pH 10 it is reduced upto 70% and above pH 10 it did not showed any hemagglutination activity. Dynamic scattering experiment showed that hyacinth lectin was monomeric in nature with no aggregation in solution. The hydrodynamic redii of hyacinth lectin showed 2.38 \u00b1 0.03 nm which corresponds to a molecular weight of \u223c30 kDa [39]. Antiproliferative and apoptosis activity have been shown in case of various lectins isolated from plant bulbs such as Sauromatum venosum, Arisaema jacquemontii\n[40], [41] We have demonstrated dose dependent antiproliferative nature of hyacinth lectin against human cancer cell lines Caco-2 and HeLa. Among the two cell lines we observe higher sensitivity of lectin mediated apoptotic response in Caco-2 cells with an IC50 value of 127 \u00b1 5 \u03bcg/mL. This is the first report from hyacinth lectin on antiproliferative activity although other lectins from different plant sources have been reported for their anti-proliferative activity [42].",
