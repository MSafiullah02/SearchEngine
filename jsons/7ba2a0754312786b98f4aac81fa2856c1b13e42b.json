In addition to appropriate room cleaning protocols, it is also important to schedule sufficient time between TEE studies to allow adequate air flow exchanges within the TEE procedure room. This time is typically institution and exam room specific, and guided by infection control policies. This time is generally 1 hour if HEPA filters or other airflow management systems are not in place. Protocols will vary among institutions depending on the phase of the reintroduction of services. Special rooms may be designated for TEE procedures in COVID-19 positive or suspect cases. 6 American Society of Echocardiography ASEcho.org",

As social distancing is impractical for the performance of TTE, this adds additional stress to team members. Effective communication of and strict adherence to safety protocols can help reduce staff anxiety about returning to the work environment. Attention should be paid to the daily or weekly staffing schedule to ensure appropriate assignment of workload and rest between cases for all laboratory staff. Strategies to assist staff in coping with stress and enhancing resilience should be incorporated. The ASE Wellness Center is an example of a website with helpful resources for echocardiography providers. [2] Continued inclusion of learners will be important as echocardiography services resume. While education remains a vital consideration in academic institutions, student learners may still need to be excluded from high-risk examinations (e.g., TEE in COVID-19 cases), while trainees in an advanced educational program should be incorporated in the daily schedule while minimizing exposure risk. Opportunities for remote education using video conferencing should continue to be used during the initial phases of reintroduction of services to minimize exposure.

Recommendations on echo exam timing in the COVID-19 recuperative phase should be guided by infection control experts at the local institution and focused on minimizing staff exposure, and ensuring the appropriate use of PPE. However, patients post-COVID-19 recovery will require serial temporally negative COVID-19 tests, and resolution of respiratory symptoms (cough and shortness of breath) for a pre-specified time interval. There may be instances when echocardiograms are required in acutely ill COVID-19 patients. The indications will be similar to the prioritization schedule noted above. Development of special pathways for echo exams in COVID-19 patients should be considered for infection control. Examples include dedicated clinic and testing areas for these patients, with portable exams preferred including the use of focused protocols.[10] If dedicated areas are not feasible, COVID-19 patients expected to arrive to the testing facility should be identified and escorted directly into the echo exam room, bypassing the waiting area. A facemask should be mandatory throughout the stay in the facility. Dedicated exam rooms and machines, including portable systems for point of care exams for COVID-19 positive patients are recommended. 12 American Society of Echocardiography ASEcho.org",

Many institutions now have turnaround time for PCR testing of 1-3 hours. Thus, testing could be performed on the day of the sedated echocardiogram. If PCR testing is positive, consideration should be made to defer the sedated echocardiogram. For conscious sedation in PCR negative patients, standard or droplet precautions may be used as appropriate for the sonographer, sedation provider, and other health care providers in the room.A mask could be place on the patient as long as he/she is monitored by a front-line provider with expertise in monitoring patients undergoing conscious sedation. Centers using inhaled anesthetics and intubation for sedated echocardiograms should consider conscious sedation protocols to avoid more significant aerosolized procedures.Finally, it has been noted that the majority of children who acquire COVID-19 are asymptomatic or only suffer from mild symptoms. However, a new and troubling pediatric presentation of COVID-19 has appeared, particularly in Europe and the United States. This \"Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome\" includes fever, elevated inflammatory markers, abdominal pain (sometimes mimicking appendicitis), vomiting, diarrhea and, in extreme cases, multi-organ failure. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing can be positive or negative but IgG antibodies are often positive. The presentation can look similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic-shock syndrome with some reports of myocarditis, ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias and coronary artery aneurysms.[14,15] Elevated B-natriuretic peptide, troponin, WBC, CRP, and ferritins have been reported. Pediatric echocardiographers need to be aware of this illness and its echocardiographic findings. Serial echocardiograms, even daily for those in the critical care setting, may be required given the rapid evolution and changes in function. Importantly, children who present with these15 American Society of Echocardiography ASEcho.org symptoms should be treated as if they are COVID-19 positive even if testing is negative. Thus, higher level PPE with N-95 masks or airborne precautions should be used to image the patients when an echocardiogram is needed. Moreover, a focused echocardiogram should be performed when possible to limit exposure time and the echocardiography machine should be decontaminated after the study is completed.",

For example, new entrance procedures at hospital or clinic facilities, new sanitization protocols and use of PPE may result in additional time required for the echocardiogram appointment. For reception and waiting areas, floor markings and signs should guide arriving patients so they may queue at appropriate distances apart from others.

The proposed levels of response for reintroduction of services was recently published by North American cardiovascular societies.[6] Briefly, Level 2 is the initial phase of response with the reintroduction of select services. Level 1 reintroduces most services with appropriate precautions and safeguards in place. Level 0 includes provision of all routine services with ongoing COVID-19 testing and surveillance with monitoring of PPE supplies.[6] Appropriate hand hygiene and equipment cleansing remains critical at all times. During the initial phase of declining COVID-19 case admissions and partial reopening of services (response level 2), standard precautions should be followed for outpatient TTE exams and require a surgical mask for both the patient and provider(s).[7] This requirement for wearing surgical facemasks may be adjusted in subsequent response levels as the pandemic abates from 'mandatory' to 'recommended' or 'optional'. Meticulous disinfection of equipment and exam areas including laboratory office spaces with viricidal agents should remain unchanged through different response levels and is likely to become a permanent change induced by the pandemic.Inpatient TTE exams should follow standard precautions for known COVID-19 negative cases, and escalated to droplet precautions for ICU cases. During response levels 1 and 0, given lower COVID-19 prevalence in the community, standard precautions may be considered appropriate inICU and other inpatient cases for TTE exams. echocardiography: The level of PPE for TEE examinations deserves special mention. TEE is considered an aerosol generating procedure, and airborne precautions are recommended for COVID-19 positive or suspected, symptomatic cases when the TEE exam cannot wait until test results are known. Droplet precautions should be followed for all other TEEs performed during response level 2 including TEE exams performed in the surgical operating room and hybrid operating rooms for structural heart interventions. The requirement for a face shield is optional in known negative cases and should be judiciously considered in context of local institutional resources and policies. Standard precautions may be considered appropriate for TEEs performed during lower response levels when routine services have resumed across the institution. Conservation of PPE is an important consideration in all approaches to maintain preparedness for a surge in cases, while minimizing risk to providers with reasonable certainty. COVID-19. Subsequent COVID-19 testing may be reserved for symptomatic patients or those who have failed the initial screening. Testing affords the opportunity to defer exams in patients The sensitivity of different types of tests remains variable. At the time of writing this statement, there were more than 65 different kinds of COVID-19 molecular or serologic tests available in the United States tests that received emergency use authorizations by the US Food and DrugAdministration.[8] Since this is a new virus, past experience and recommendations for standardized testing do not exist, leading to variability in sensitivity and specificity of each test",
