            "text": "In an infectious disease outbreak, there are additional challenges that are unique to a radiation oncology department and must be considered:1.Time sensitive nature of oncology treatment. Radiotherapy patients typically require a multi-fraction course of treatment entailing daily visits to the department. Treatments cannot be postponed like elective surgeries without the risk of adverse clinical consequences. For example, in a patient with squamous cell head and neck cancer, 33 fractions of radiation is delivered over 6.5 week. Each week of delay translates to 14% lesser cancer control.[8]2.Radiation Oncology side effects mimicking COVID-19 symptoms. The typical presentation of COVID-19 is nonspecific.[9] Early symptoms may include low grade fever, cough, sore throat, running nose. Many cancer patients on chemotherapy have low grade fever. A sore throat may be due to mucositis from head and neck radiotherapy. Many lung cancer patients may have respiratory symptoms of varying degrees.3.Unique fractionated nature of radiotherapy. The reduction of clinical workload will take time. Even without taking on new patients, existing patients must finish their course of treatment before workload decreases.4.Many oncology centres have satellite centres and satellite clinics with reduced capability due to the high cost of linear accelerators. The radiation oncology departments may have to cover satellite centers, with staff working across multiple hospitals. This poses a risk of possible cross infection if a staff becomes infected.5.Patients with fever should be isolated in a separate room. However, it is not practical to designate a dedicated linear accelerator, CT simulation room for patients at risk6.Many patients are seen in the department daily and can be grouped into outpatient follow-ups, on treatment reviews and hospital inpatient referrals. Considerations must be made to minimize contact between different patient groups.7.Careful manpower planning of doctors, allied health and nurses is required for continued provision of the service, to keep them safe from the disease, and to prevent burn out. Additional staff are also required to help with additional duties, such as temperature screening, triage and contact tracing.8.Infrastructure considerations within the department for staff physical segregation\n",

It is worth noting that the threat of staff catching COVID-19 is more likely to come from social rather than medical interactions. It is important, therefore, that staff exercise social distancing after work hours where possible. Furthermore, the parent institution may redeploy radiotherapy department staff to other sectors helping to manage an outbreak, further depleting already scarce manpower resources. Depending on individual departments, manpower may be augmented by cancellation of conference leave or overseas leave. Having a policy in place will facilitate claims and reimbursements for leave cancellation.",

Within each team, there were separate allocated locations for meals for different groups of staff (physics, nurses, radiation therapists) to prevent mixing. In some large centres, there may be more than one cluster of consultation, planning and treatment rooms. This would serve as an ideal way of physical separation. Where this is not possible in small centres, every effort should be made to temporally segregate staff through shift rotations or staggering of mealtimes to minimize possible cross-contamination. Special attention needs to be given to certain sections of the multidisciplinary teams which are small but essential, for instance physicists. These staff are required to observe strict segregation to ensure that there is no cross-contamination that may bring radiotherapy services to a stop.5.Remote planning\n",
