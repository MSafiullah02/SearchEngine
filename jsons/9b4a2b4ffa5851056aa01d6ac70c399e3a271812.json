Despite refinement in lung preservation and improvement in surgical techniques and peri-operative care, lung ischemia-reperfusion injury remains a significant cause of early morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation [1]. Clinical symptoms will usually occur within the first 72 hours after lung transplantation and consist of non-cardiogenic lung edema, increased pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, decreased lung compliance and hypoxemia [2\u00b17]. Microscopy shows diffuse alveolar damage with micro-atelectases. Although approximately 97% of the recipients show some degree of reperfusion edema on chest X-ray, severe lung ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs in 15\u00b130% of lung transplant recipients [8] . The most severe form of lung ischemia-reperfusion injury is primary acute graft failure which clinically resembles the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); both conditions lead to increased utilization of intensive care resources, extended hospital stay and mortality [9\u00b111].",

The major obstacle to long-term survival is the development of post lung transplant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, which is associated with chronic transplant dysfunction. This affects about 50% of patients who survive beyond 3 months after transplantation [13] . The exact etiology of the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is not fully understood but its pathogenesis appears to involve a`response to injury' type of pattern, where multiple periods of injury may result in this syndrome (Fig. 1 ).

The proteins of pulmonary surfactant can be divided into two groups: the hydrophilic proteins SP-A and SP-D, and the hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C. SP-B, as well as SP-C, have been demonstrated to enhance lipid insertion into the monolayer at the air/liquid interface. In this way they maintain a low surface tension, thereby protecting the surface film from being contaminated by nonsurfactant proteins, which can result in inactivation or degradation of the surfactant film. SP-A and SP-D are believed to be molecules of the innate immune system through their ability to recognize a broad spectrum of pathogens. Several studies have shown that SP-A and SP-D interact with a number of viruses, bacteria and fungi, and with inhaled glycoconjugate allergens, such as pollen grains and mite allergens [10] . Furthermore, SP-A has been suggested to play an important role in phospholipid secretion and recycling, formation of tubular myelin and blocking surfactant inhibition by serum proteins [21, 22] . Surfactant can be divided by ultra centrifugation into two subfractions, which differ in morphological appearance and density. The heavy subtype or large aggregate subform of surfactant is highly surface active, contains a high amount of SP and is made up of tubular myelin, lamellar bodies and large vesicles. The light subtype or small aggregate subform has a poor surface lowering capacity and consists of small vesicles [22] .",

Nevertheless, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is depleted during ischemia, which ultimately causes inactivation of ATP-dependent membrane pumps, an increase in intracellular calcium, inflammation, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell death [10, 25] (Fig. 3 ).",

During ATP depletion, the Na + /K + -ATPase pump becomes inactivated, leading to an increase in intracellular Na + . As a result, the Na + /Ca 2+ pump will not function, causing Ca 2+ to accumulate inside the cell. When ischemia is prolonged, the ionic balance may be so upset that the Na + / Ca 2+ -pump activity is reversed, resulting in import of Ca 2+ in exchange for Na + , thereby exacerbating calcium overload. Other mechanisms contributing to high intracellular Ca 2+ levels are an inactive plasmalemmal ATP-dependent Ca 2+ -pump, important to move Ca 2+ out of the cell, liberation of stored cytoplasmic calcium due to the acidosis, and a decreased uptake by the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum [10, 25] .",

Clamping time generally ranges from 60 to 120 minutes (van der Kaaij, et al., unpublished data) [31, 32] . After declamping, reperfusion occurs. Although this in vivo model is technically much easier than the aforementioned transplantation models, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, warm ischemia is used, accompanied by a high metabolic rate. However, the use of short periods of warm ischemia is accepted as an accelerated model of ischemia-reperfusion injury of the lung [33] . Additionally, because of often long warm ischemic periods, severe ischemia-reperfusion injury is induced resulting in still high mortality. As a result, most studies still investigate short time periods (max. 6 hours) after the start of reperfusion. Only a few studies report long reperfusion times of about 1 week [27, 32] ; however, in these studies mortality was still very high after extubation of the animals. We have recently developed a model of lung ischemia-reperfusion injury in which (by adjusting the anesthetic protocol and ventilator strategy) we are able to study intervals up to months after reperfusion, with acceptable mortality (van der Kaaij, et al., unpublished data).",

Both different warm (1\u00b12 h [3, 36] , van der Kaaij, et al., unpublished data) and cold (2\u00b120 h [2, 4, 5, 19, 35] ) ischemic intervals have resulted in increased levels of alveolar protein between 1 and 24 hours after reperfusion. Due to ROS, proteolytic enzymes and phospholipases, endogenous surfactant and the endothelial and epithelial membrane are damaged. This results in leakage of proteins into the alveolus and surfactant com-ponents into the bloodstream. Since surfactant is rate limiting for the transfer of proteins across the alveolo-capillary membrane and is either inactivated or lost due to the increased endothelial permeability after lung ischemia-reperfusion injury, a further influx of proteins is facilitated. Because proteins, once accumulated in the alveolus, then dose-dependently inhibit surfactant, this results in a self-triggering mechanism of surfactant inactivation [24] . Under normal conditions, SP-A is able to counteract the inactivating effects of serum proteins on surfactant [41] . However, after lung ischemia-reperfusion injury, a decrease in SP-A was found in human lung transplant recipients and animal models of lung ischemia-reperfusion injury [19, 42] .",

Moreover, in lung transplant recipients, the level of SP-A is still low more than one year after transplantation [42] . SP-A can be degraded by ROS and proteolytic enzymes. It was . Edema results in dilution of the surfactant phospholipids inside the alveolus, which results in further formation of edema. A decrease in SP-A leads to [1] less inhibition of serum proteins, and [2] decreased phospholipid secretion, recycling, and formation of tubular myelin. [3] SP-B&C degradation causes less phospholipids to be inserted into the phospholipid monolayer lining the alveolar epithelium. [4] Once serum proteins have infiltrated the alveolus, they compete for a place at the air-liquid interface, thereby dose-dependently inhibiting surfactant function. Furthermore, once the phospholipid monolayer is damaged, the molecule transfer limiting function of surfactant is also impaired, resulting in further influx of serum proteins, so that a vicious circle has developed. [5] Finally AT II cells, important in the production, recycling and secretion of surfactant phospholipids are damaged, so that less LA is secreted and a smaller amount of SA is being recycled. Due to these factors, a decrease in LA and an increase in SA has been noticed after lung ischemia-reperfusion injury also shown that the levels of SP-A decreased with ascending severity of lung ischemia-reperfusion injury, suggesting that preservation or amelioration of SP-A is essential for improvement after lung ischemia-reperfusion injury [19] . Besides the protein inhibiting function of SP-A, SP-A also plays a central role in phospholipid secretion and recycling, contributing to a decrease in surface activity of surfactant.",

DPPC, the saturated form of phosphatidylcholine, is the most important phospholipid known to reduce the minimum surface tension. Although Klepetko [29, 37\u00b140, 44] . Furthermore, it was demonstrated that when, in the case of replacement therapy, surfactant was administered just before, at or after reperfusion, it improved lung compliance and PaO 2 and prevented an increase in the small aggregate/light aggregate ratio directly after lung ischemia-reperfusion injury [4, 35] . However, other studies have shown that treatment with exogenous surfactant before the onset of ischemia is more beneficial when compared to treatment at reperfusion [30, 35, 45, 46] . This can be explained by less complement activation, diminished membrane damage, and an enlarged surfactant phospholipid pool after donor treatment, thereby preventing deterioration of the entire endogenous surfactant pool [6, 46] . Also, surfactant given to the donor may result in a more homogeneous distribution in the lung as compared to treatment after reperfusion, when alveolar damage has already occurred [6] .",

In this regard, Erasmus and colleagues demonstrated that surfactant treatment just before reperfusion enhanced recovery from lung ischemia-reperfusion injury at one week postoperatively [27] . We confirm that lung ischemia-reperfusion injury resulted in the conversion of surfactant into less active surfactant, and impaired PaO 2 and lung compliance throughout the first week after reperfusion. However, even months after reperfusion, diffuse alveolar damage and decreased lung compliance were visible. Surfactant treatment before the induction of warm ischemia completely normalized these parameters from 3 to 90 days after reperfusion (van der Kaaij et al., unpublished data).",

However, some studies failed to show a decrease in leakage of serum proteins into the alveolus, which can probably be explained by the different treatment strategies [6, 35, 48] . We hypothesize that surfactant administration to the donor may be more beneficial in inhibiting serum protein leakage than treatment at the time of reperfusion. However, once alveolar proteins accumulate in the alveolus, the lung can resist against surfactant inactivation by the interference of SP-A.

As mentioned earlier, an increase in the small/large aggregate ratio occurs due to lung ischemia-reperfusion injury. Since most of the exogenous surfactant administered to lung is in the large aggregate subform, a larger pool of surface-active phospholipids (DPPC) is created, so that the rise in small/large aggregate ratio is prevented [6, 28] . Thus, the instilled exogenous surfactant protects the endogenous surfactant pool against damage. This is illustrated by the fact that the normal endogenous surfactant pool is about 10\u00b115 mg lipid per kilogram, and that the amount of surfactant used for treatment is in the range of 50\u00b1400 mg lipid per kilogram [6] .",

Surfactant treatment can thus ameliorate the accumulation and adherence of inflammatory cells, so that endothelial and AT II injury is prevented, normalizing cell permeability and surfactant recycling.

In a case report by Str\u00e7ber and colleagues in 1995, a 26-year old woman who underwent right lung transplantation and developed severe reperfusion injury 5 hours after transplantation, was treated with intrapulmonary nebulized synthetic surfactant [53] . Shortly after surfactant therapy, lung compliance, PaO 2 , and tidal volume increased. Moreover, 24 hours after therapy, the edematous infiltrate of the transplanted lung on chest X-ray film was resolved. Another study in six lung transplant patients also suggested improvement in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury due to surfactant replacement. However, in 1 of the 6 recipients, surfactant therapy failed to improve dynamic lung compliance, which could be attributed to the application approach or the type of surfactant used (synthetic versus natural surfactant) [52] .",

Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury damages the endogenous surfactant system by the production of ROS, proteolytic enzymes, and (phospho)lipases. Surfactant is composed of phospholipids and associated proteins and its main function is to reduce the surface tension inside the alveolus, allowing normal breathing. Impairment of the surfactant system will increase surface tension (leading to instability and collapse of alveoli), atelectasis formation, influx of serum proteins into the alveolus, pulmonary edema, decreased lung compliance, and impaired gas exchange.",

Although human data on the use of surfactant in lung transplant patients are scarce, the positive results in experimental models and a few patient reports suggest that (pre)treatment with surfactant in lung transplantation patients could improve outcome. Future studies should further investigate the effect of surfactant on lung ischemia-reperfusion injury markers on both short and long term.",

By changing the lung preservation solution from Euro-Collins to low potassium dextran solution, and by flushing the graft retrograde instead of antegrade, the damaging effects of lung ischemia-reperfusion injury on pulmonary surfactant could be ameliorated",
