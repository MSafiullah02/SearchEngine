We chose to represent only this state variable for clarity, and for the obvious implications on emergency management. The baseline shown in Fig. 4 is the one in which the model has been identified (lower curve and data) by including changes in the spatial human mobility and in collective social behavior, jointly with their timing (Materials and Methods). The other two curves represent \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. The first (scenario A), corresponding to the middle curve in the graph, is the one in which only the first set of containment measures is implemented. The second (scenario B), portrayed by the upper curve, is obtained by excluding all containment measures. The comparison between scenarios allows us to estimate the number of averted cases (excess of hospitalization demand with respect to the baseline), jointly with their spatial distributions (maps of scenarios A and B in Fig. 4). The actual number of averted cases is obtained by the difference of hospitalizations between the baseline and scenario B (no containment measures). We obtain a median of 0.226\u22c5106 averted cases (95% CI: 0.172\u22c5106 to 0.347\u22c5106), as of March 25, 2020.",

Our analysis of the contributions of different compartments points to the important role played by presymptom infectious in the disease spread and growth (Table 2). The estimated high presymptomatic transmission parameter \u03b2P, with respect to the transmission rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious \u03b2I,A, reproduces field epidemiological evidence (49) and provides support for explicitly accounting for the presymptomatic compartment in the SEPIA model. This result may have profound implications for containment measures [possibly even centralized quarantines (50)], because it may suggest the need for a massive swab testing to identify and isolate presymptomatic infectious cases (51). This underpins that greatly improved contact tracing has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if reliably used on sufficiently large numbers (52).",

At first sight, in fact, the effects of the second set of measures taken in March could erroneously appear less important than in reality (A in Fig. 4).

Specifically, 1) although the human effort involved in the collection of epidemiological data has been major, the granularity of available data is limited in time, spatial resolution, and individual information [for instance, the only published assessment of mobility changes in Italy following lockdown (37) refers to publicly unavailable data; properly anonymized call detail records have been useful in other epidemic and endemic contexts (34, 53, 54)]; 2) should anonymized individual information from hospitals and laboratories be available, a proper probability distribution of relevant rates and periods (e.g., latency, incubation, infection) could be employed by any modeling approaches (see ref. 55 for estimates based on high data granularity regarding the Lombardy region); and 3) the effect of age structure (56) in terms of differential mobility, social contact patterns, vulnerability, and case fatality ratio [often associated with hyperinflammation in elderly people (57)] would need to be included, therefore relying on higher granularity of data (39). Further developments may also deal with operational predictions based on our modeling framework, once coupled, for example, to ensemble Kalman filtering and updates of parameter estimates and state variables, as already customary in other epidemiological studies (58\u201360), and currently employed only in a few studies on COVID-19 (28, 61). The spatial nature of the model, in fact, would possibly aid the planning of the agenda for differential mobility restrictions and deployments of local medical supplies and staff tuned to local epidemiological and logistic conditions. We do not attempt, at this stage, to simulate the long-term evolution of the disease dynamics, because it depends on the time evolution of the conditions determining critical epidemiological parameters such as people\u2019s behavior and contact rates, further restrictions to mobility, or the discovery of new specific antiviral drugs (62).",

Indeed, the total expected number of averted hospitalizations in Italy, a significant measure of the needs of emergency management (and the less error-prone epidemiological measure), ran on the order of 200,000 cases up to March 25, 2020, for the whole country, and is known with sufficient spatial granularity.

Empirical evidence (see again Table 1) shows, in fact, that the serial interval of COVID-19 tends to be shorter than the incubation period, thus suggesting that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission can occur prior to illness onset (68). Presymptom transmission appears to play an important role in speeding up the spread of the disease within a community, accounting for around 12.6% of case reports in China (49), 48% in Singapore, and 62% in Tianjin, China (74). The core of our model is thus termed SEPIA and includes the following compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Presymptomatic (P), Infected with heavy symptoms (I), Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic (A), Hospitalized (H), Quarantined at home (Q), Recovered (R), and Dead (D) individuals.",

In particular, the number of infected people (be they exposed, presymptomatic, symptomatic, or asymptomatic) depends on the effort being devoted to finding new positive cases, namely, the number of specimen collections (swabs) from PUIs. The standard methodology employed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit (ISS) for confirming a suspected case is the one used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (76). According to the bulletin of the ISS (17), a median time between the beginning of symptoms and the confirmed diagnosis (positive swabs) ranges between 3 d and 4 d. Sometimes, however, people test positive even without displaying symptoms (e.g., they are tested because they were in contact with symptomatic infectious). Therefore, it seems that the number of positive swabs may not provide a reliable indication of the number of exposed, and probably little indication of the number of presymptom individuals. Actually, these data seem to provide an idea about the number of people who are infectious and have developed mild symptoms (isolated at home) or more serious symptoms (hospitalized), but much less about those with very mild symptoms who are not always subjected to a test.",

Specifically, we define the likelihood based on daily numbers of hospitalized cases (flux \u03b7I), discharged from hospital (\u03b3HH), and recorded deaths (\u03b1HH) at the province level. To account for possible overdispersion of the data, we assume that each data point follows a negative binomial distribution (78, 79) with mean \u03bc, equal to the value predicted by the model, and variance equal to \u03c9\u03bc (NB1 parametrization).

During this period, the disease was likely seeded into other provinces via either human mobility or importation of cases from abroad. The process during this period was likely characterized by high demographic stochasticity due to the low number of involved individuals, and thus it can hardly be captured by our deterministic modeling of average mobility and disease transmission. Moreover, long-distance travels and importation of cases are not accounted for in the data used to represent human mobility, which mostly reflect commuting fluxes for work and study purposes. Therefore, to include this possible seeding effect, we estimated also the initial condition in each province. Specifically, this is done by seeding a small fraction of exposed individuals at the beginning of the simulation.",

The parameter \u03b2P is expressed as a function of the local reproduction number R0 (SI Appendix). \u03b2P1 and \u03b2P2 represent the values of the parameter \u03b2P after the measures introduced on February 22 and on March 8, 2020, respectively. The fraction of symptomatic infected being quarantined, \u03b6, is assumed to be equal to 0.4, that is, the average value for Italy during the observed period (17). During preliminary tests, we found a correlation between the asymptomatic fraction (1\u2212\u03c3) and the asymptomatic transmission rate \u03b2A. Indeed, in the early phase of an epidemic, when the depletion of susceptible is not significant, it is difficult to estimate the role or asymptomatics. We therefore fixed \u03c3 to a reasonable value (\u03c3=0.25; see, e.g., ref. 80) and estimated \u03b2A. The parameter rX represents the fraction of total personal contacts that individuals belonging to the X compartment have in the destination community (SI Appendix). We assume rS=0.5 (i.e., each individual has, on average, half of the contacts in the place of work or study) and that rE=rP=rA=rR=rS, while rI=rQ=rH=0 (no extra province mobility of symptomatic infected, quarantined, and hospitalized individuals). Further assumptions aimed at reducing the number of parameters to be estimated are \u03b3Q=\u03b3I=\u03b3H,\u03b3A=2\u03b3I, and \u03b1H=\u03b1I. We use information summarized in Table 1 to define prior distributions of key timescale parameters (Table 2). Moreover, the viral load of symptomatic cases is reportedly similar to that of the asymptomatic (81). We use such information to define the prior of the ratio \u03b2I/\u03b2A.",
