            "text": "Chikungunya virus [CHIKV] and dengue viruses [DENV] have many similarities in clinical manifestations and epidemiology, as well as means of transmission by Aedes species of mosquitoes. Moreover, the emergence and pattern of spread of dengue virus disease [DVD] from tropical and subtropical regions of the world to a global dispersal more than 50 years ago is being repeated by CHIKV in the last few years. Although both conditions are largely self-limited, systemic viral infections transmitted primarily between humans and mosquitoes, they evolve from Africa or Asia as zoonotic infections between nonhuman primates and other small animals with humans as secondary hosts. Presently, endemic and epidemic outbreaks of dengue viruses and CHIKV are through human-to-human transmission by mosquitoes, rather than enzootic or epizootic means. The spread of these viruses globally is directly related to the dispersal and adaptation of the vectors, Aedes aegypti\nand more recently . The primary vector, the urban adapted Ae. aegypti mosquito, is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is believed that this vector emerged from Africa during the slave trade in the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries to the Americas and Caribbean, spread through Asia during commercial trading in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and spread more globally in the past 50\u201360 years with increased international travel and trade [1]. Ae. aegypti was initially introduced in Europe\nduring the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries where it existed in southern Europe until its disappearance during the twentieth century and has since returned on Madeira and the Black Sea Coast [2]. Ae. aegypti eggs may have been transmitted to the Americas by water containers on slave ships, and now it is believed that larvae and eggs of the Asian tiger mosquito, Ae. albopictus\n, were imported into the western hemisphere from Japan through trade of used car tires, where the mosquitoes lay its drought-resistant eggs in collected rainwater [3]. Although the burden global of dengue is estimated between 50 and 100 million cases a year affecting about 100 countries with over 2.5 billion people at risk [4], there is no similar estimate of the global burden or annual incidence of CHIKV disease as outbreaks are more variable, and small sporadic outbreaks are often attributed to dengue. Zika virus, also transmitted by Aedes species of mosquitoes, was recognized to cause mild sporadic disease in Africa and Asia for decades until its emergence in the southwestern Pacific Ocean in 200 and sudden explosive outbreak throughout the Americas and Caribbean in 2015\u20132016.",

However, urban transmission from virus circulating in eastern Africa in nonhuman primates to humans had occurred on multiple occasions [7]. Outbreaks of CHIKV infection across Africa\nwere associated with heavy rainfall in rural forested areas with increased mosquito population and spillover from the enzootic forest cycle to epizootic savannah cycle, with exposure to nonimmune populations. During epidemics the CHIKV can circulate between human populations without the presence of animal reservoirs [8]. Subsequent emergence and spread of the virus beyond Africa are estimated to have occurred in the eighteenth century, with carriage of infected mosquitoes aboard sailing ships along with barrels of stored water and with humans to maintain the propagation of the mosquitoes and a local cycle [9]. CHIKV of African lineage is believed to have been introduced in Asia in the nineteenth century or sometimes between 1879 and 1956, after adaptation into urban cycle [10].",

            "text": "Outbreaks of CHIKV in Asia\nwere first recognized in 1954 from the Philippines with subsequent outbreaks in 1956 and 1968 [8]. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the virus spread throughout southern and Southeast Asia, with frequent epidemics and sporadic activity in many Asian countries, but eventually the virus activity dwindled and ceased for many years with only localized outbreaks. After several decades of inactivity, CHIKV reemerged in 2000 as an urban epidemic in Kinshasa [Democratic Republic of the Congo] after 39 years of absence [11] and reappeared in Indonesia after 20 years of inactivity in 2001\u20132003 [12]. In 2004, an outbreak involving the ECSA [eastern, central, and southern African] lineage progenitor began in the coastal towns of Kenya and spread to several Indian Ocean Islands and onto India where it caused massive outbreaks of several million people [13]. Infected air travelers from the Indian Ocean basin outbreaks retuned to Europe, Australia, the Americas and other parts of Asia, and secondary local transmission resulted in Italy, urban France, South and Southeast Asia [10]. The extent of the explosive outbreaks in the Indian Ocean basin\nhas been attributed partly due to the ease of air travel which facilitated rapid spread, large dense urban populations previously na\u00efve to CHIKV exposure and vulnerable to infections, dense populations of Aedes mosquitoes with introduction of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes into this region from native Asia islands in 1985, and adaptive mutations of the new Indian lineage CHIKV strains which resulted in enhanced transmission by the new mosquito vector [14\u201316]. Ae. albopictus mosquito species were not implicated as a major vector in prior Asian epidemics and older Asian lineage of CHIKV was not well adapted to this mosquito [17].",

Benjamin Rush has been attributed to provide the first detailed clinical description of DENV infection, as well as the as the application of the term \u201c breakbone fever,\u201d in an epidemic in Philadelphia in 1879 [22]. The discovery that dengue fever was due to a virus was from experiments in human volunteers at Fort McKinley in the Philippines in 1907 [23].

After the World War 1 , the pattern of DENV infections changed in Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and the Philippines from episodic epidemics to persistent endemic state, but the Caribbean and the Americas remained intermittently active. By the late 1920s, major epidemics occurred throughout the Gulf and Atlantic states, the Caribbean, South Africa, Egypt, and Greece, affecting millions of people. With eradication of Ae. aegypti, DENV was eliminated from the Mediterranean region by the mid-1940s [22]. By the 1960s and 1970s, there was dramatic increase in dengue activity in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and by the 1990s there was a global distribution of all DENV serotypes to urban populations. Since the arrival of the twenty-first century, the annual incidence of dengue fever and intensity of epidemics have dramatically increased around the world. Several major outbreaks have occurred in this century in the Americas, Southeast Asia, and Asia, and all DENV serotypes have global hyperendemicity, and it is expected that recurrent outbreaks will continue possibly in cycles of 3\u20135 years, with annual mortality of 20,000 or more [22].",

ZIKV was subsequently isolated from Aedes africanus mosquitoes from the same forest in 1948 [29]. Although serological studies in the early 1950s indicated that humans could be infected with ZIKV, the virus was first isolated from humans in 1968 in Nigeria and from 1971 to 1975 [30, 31]. Subsequent studies from 1951 to 1981 found serological evidence of ZIKV infection throughout Africa [Uganda, Tanzania, Egypt, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, and Gabon] and parts of Asia [India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia] [32]. ZIKV was isolated from Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in Malaysia in 1968\u201369 [33], and since then it has been considered the primary vector for the virus. Infection with ZIKV first emerged outside Africa and Asia in 2007, when it caused an outbreak in the southwestern Pacific Ocean Yap Island, of the Federated States of Micronesia [34]. Since then it has spread to other Pacific islands, French Polynesia in 2013\u20132014, Caledonia, Cook Islands, Cape Verde, and then Easter Island [Chile], and subsequently to Brazil and Columbia [35]. Since 2015\u2013early 2016, an explosive outbreak has occurred in the Americas and Caribbean with over 30 countries affected, and it is predicted that by the end of 2016, four million people could be affected [Amedeo Zika Virus, http://amedeo.com/medicine/zik.htm]. By February 1, 2016, the WHO declared ZIKV a global public health emergency because of the reported association of microcephaly in newborns of infected pregnant women in Brazil.",

A potential fifth serotype [DENV-5] was isolated from a patient in Borneo, but it is unclear if this strain can cause sustained transmission between humans [39]. Infection with a particular serotype will usually produce lifelong immunity to that serotype and associated genotypes, but cross protection against other serotypes is generally weak and short-lived, lasting for 2\u20133 months [40]. Dengue virions are spherical, about 50 nm in diameter with a host-derived lipid bilayer containing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome coding for three structural and seven nonstructural proteins [40]. Ancestral dengue virus arose 1000\u20132000 years ago among monkeys in either Africa or Asia, and it is estimated that DENV-1 and DENV-2 emerged more recently, within the past three centuries [41]. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that all four endemic DENVs evolved from sylvatic progenitors in the forest of Asia and only DENV-2 could have emerged from African jungles [22]. The emergence of endemic DENV with humans as the only reservoir may have occurred within the past 2000 years and theoretically should be controllable with an effective vaccine. However, sylvatic DENV still exist in the forests of Asia and Africa, and fitness studies of sylvatic DENV-2 compared with human-circulating endemic/epidemic strains suggest that little genetic adaptation was required for the initial emergence of endemic strains. Hence sylvatic reservoirs in Asia and Africa will remain as a source of reemergence [22].",

There is only one strain recognized to date with three to five clades based on site and place of isolation, i.e., Zika Uganda 47, Senegal 84 [a, b, c], and Yap 2007. Based on phylogenetic analysis of ZIKV sequences, there are only two main virus lineages [African and Asian], and the strain responsible for the Yap Island and Pacific Ocean epidemics and the outbreak in the Americas likely originated in Southeast Asia [42, 43]. It has been estimated that ZIKV emerged in East Africa around 1920, and in the late 1940s, the seropositivity was 6.1% of the population in Uganda, and by the late 1960s, Kenya demonstrated seropositivity of 52% [44]. ZIKV has been isolated from several species of Aedes mosquitoes and wild monkeys, which are considered the natural hosts. In Africa ZIKV still maintains a sylvatic transmission cycle between nonhuman primates by species of Aedes mosquitoes, but in Asia this has not been demonstrated but possibly exists. It was demonstrated in the laboratory that infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes could transmit ZIKV to mice and monkeys and that the extrinsic incubation period in mosquitoes was about 10 days [45]. The virus can be isolated from monkeys 9 days after inoculation and in humans the first day of illness and can be detected up to 11 days after onset [31, 33]. Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are the main vectors of ZIKV, but it is likely the virus can also be transmitted by Ae. albopictus. Most of the ZIKV transmission is from human to mosquito-human spread of the virus, but transmission of infections has been documented through intrauterine infection of the developing fetus, sexual transmission, potential blood transfusion, and laboratory exposure [46\u201349]. Sexual transmission from male returning travelers who acquired infection in South America has been reported, and this may occur before, during, and after development of symptoms [50, 51]. High viral RNA or replicative viral particles have been detected in sperm up to 62 days after onset of symptoms [52, 53]. Preliminary data [one case] indicate that ZIKV can be transmitted by body fluids such as tears or saliva, when the viral load is extremely high [54]. MMWR Morb. Mortal.

            "text": "\nAe. aegypti, the primary mosquito vector for DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV, is distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions between 35\u00b0N and 35\u00b0S [latitude], with the lowest winter temperature of 10 \u00b0C in regions where the species can survive overwintering [55]. Expansion of Ae. aegypti population globally appears to have occurred after the end of eradication programs\nin the 1970s with return of the pre-eradication levels by 1995 [56]. The mosquito was previously widespread in southern Europe where it caused local outbreaks of yellow fever in the nineteenth century. It is well adapted to the urban environment and breed in small puddles of water and water collected in cans, empty containers, or old car tires in yards or homes. The female mosquitoes\nare the vectors of these viruses, and they feed on human hosts from early morning to just before sunset. After acquiring the virus from an infected host, there is an incubation period of 4\u201310 days and the mosquitoes remain infectious for their life-span [56]. Although the mosquitoes have limited range of flight, about 500 m, they are capable of feeding on multiple persons in a short period of time, and the movement of the infected individuals throughout and between the communities may help drive epidemics [56]. Ae. albopictus, another urban or domestic mosquito, is considered a secondary vector for DENV and CHIKV and has been implicated in previous epidemics of both viruses. Ae. aegypti had been eradicated by DDT in some regions and Ae. albopictus emerged to cause outbreaks of DENV and even larger epidemics of CHIKV in the islands of the Indian Ocean between 2006 and 2006 [57]. It appears that CHIKV had undergone adaptive mutations to Ae. albopictus to allow for greater transmissibility with more efficient crossing of the mosquito gut membrane barrier [15]. Ae. albopictus tolerates a wider range of temperature variation and environment than Ae. aegypti, from tropical to temperate climate, due to diapause or mechanism for tolerating harsh winters [57]. Although Ae. aegypti is endemic in some southern US states [Florida, Texas, and California], Ae. albopictus has spread to 36 states with its northernmost boundary in the northeastern USA including parts of New Jersey, southern New York, and Pennsylvania [58]. This mosquito is endemic in southern Europe where it has caused local outbreaks of CHIKV infection and colonized almost all Mediterranean countries [59]; besides its widespread distribution includes throughout the Americas [excluding Canada], Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific [41]. In dengue endemic areas, Ae. aegypti is considered the major vector for transmission, and Ae. albopictus is considered less efficient at transmitting the virus; however, some studies suggest that the latter may be more effective at dengue transmission\nbecause of the longer life-span of this species [60]. It has also been suggested that Ae. albopictus is less adapted to the urban environment than Ae. aegypti and may be involved in maintaining the sylvatic and rural transmission in endemic areas [61]. In a recent unique study, the direct susceptibility of these two species of mosquito to dengue infection after feeding on viremic humans was compared, Ae. albopictus was significantly less likely than Ae. aegypti to develop an infectious phenotype\n14 days after direct feeding for DENV-2 and DENV-4 but not for serotypes 1 and 3 [62].",

Recent studies indicate that CHIKV does not activate leukocytes or dendritic cells for the induction of IFNs, but the type-1 IFNs are produced by infected fibroblasts [74]. Clinical studies indicate that the innate immunity efficiently clears circulating CHIKV within 4\u20137 days [73]. Normally adaptive immune response with activation of specific B and T lymphocytes occurs after a week and likely does not play a role in controlling the acute infection, but the relative role in the chronic phase of the disease is unknown. Generation of CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies to protect against reinfection occurs during convalescence, and recovery and prophylactic administration of specific antibodies can protect against infection or disease in mice, but not 24 h after inducing infection [75]. The role of cellular immunity in CHIKV infection is undetermined, but there is likely a beneficial response, as alphavirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes can eliminate persistently infected macrophages with Old World alphaviruses [76]. Many patients recovering from CHIKV infection have chronic joint disease for several months to years, and the mechanism remains unclear. A single report suggests possible induction of autoimmune response by lymphocytes caused by cross-reactivity between viral and host antigens [77]. It has also been suggested that chronic joint symptoms are due to persistence of the virus\nwith reactive inflammation with persistent virus-specific IgM [78], and persistence of viral RNA has been demonstrated in a patient with chronic arthralgia for 18 months after CHIKV infection [79]. Current evidence indicates that CHIKV infection results in lifelong immunity and there is no significant antigenic variation between genotypes to result in immune escape [8].",

During primary viremia, the virus infects tissue macrophages of several organs, especially the liver and spleen where the virus may continue to replicate after the cessation of the viremia [88]. The initial innate response to the infection consist of the combined effect of type-1 IFNs, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u03b1] , and cell surface receptor-ligand interactions in stimulating the anti-dengue response of primary human natural killer [NK] cells [89]. The NK cells produce cytokines and lysis of target infected cells. There is also recent evidence that activated and apoptotic platelets aggregate with monocyte and signal-specific cytokine [IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP-1] responses that may contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue [90]. During primary infection, IgM antibodies become detectable about day 5 after onset of symptoms, peaks at day 10, and may last for 6 months [86]. Neutralizing IgG antibodies appear after the first week with primary infection and peak during convalescence, 14 days or after, and provide specific serotype protection for life and cross protection for heterologous virus for at least 2\u20133 months after infection and for up to 1\u20133 years [88]. During secondary infection, IgG antibody is produced faster and to higher titers and IgM if produced is diminished and may last for four months.",

Other hypotheses include that virus-antibody complexes activate the complement pathway to enhanced immune response resulting in cytokine storm or dengue-specific antibodies\ncross-react with host proteins to activate the coagulation pathway and alter endothelial cell function [91]. There is evidence that CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation plays a role in protection against dengue infection and aberrant CD8+ cell response may be involved in the cytokine storm in severe disease [88, 92].

ZIKV gains entry to skin fibroblasts and immune cells by the phosphatidylserine receptor AXL and upregulates the autophagy pathway, which enhances replication in autophagosomes [93]. There is evidence that flavivirus replication and pathogenesis involve several cellular pathways such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, cellular signaling response termed unfolded protein response, and autophagy [94]. Limited studies in patients had demonstrated polyfunctional T-cell activation, Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 response, during the acute phase with respective cytokine level increases, followed by a decrease in the recovery phase [95]. ZIKV is sensitive to the antiviral effects of both type-1 and type-2 IFNs [95], which likely result in clearance of the virus. However, flaviviruses in general surmount IFN type 1 signaling in order to proliferate intracellularly. ZIKV accomplish this by degradation of the STAT2 signaling molecule downstream of the IFN receptor in human cells [96].",

            "text": "In utero transmission and congenital abnormalities from ZIKV infection have attained global attention since the large epidemic in Brazil and the Americas, such as microcephaly, spontaneous abortion, and intrauterine growth restriction. Recently, four studies using the mouse pregnant model have investigated the effect of ZIKV on the fetuses [97\u2013100]. Inoculation of different isolates of ZIKV was via peripheral routes or directly into the fetal brain, and all studies demonstrated infection of the fetuses with brain cell damage. One of the studies [97], using deficient-type IFN-signaling mouse model and cutaneous inoculation of an Asian ZIKV strain in the first trimester [human equivalent], showed placental infection\n, injury, and impairment, with fetal brain injury and neuronal cell death. These findings would explain the human experience with ZIKV in the first and second trimester of pregnant women. These studies indicate that ZIKV can cross the placental barrier to gain access to the fetus and infect placental cells and fetal endothelial cells to cause vascular damage and impair growth and development. Moreover, seeding to the fetal brain can injure or cause death of neuroprogenitor cells and inhibit cell differentiation to explain the cortical thinning\n, microcephaly, and brain structure abnormalities in neonates of infected pregnant women [101]. Although ZIKV has been documented in maternal blood 5 days after acute symptoms, it also has been rarely reported 8 weeks and even up to 107 days after the onset of symptoms, suggesting persisting viral replication in the fetus or placenta [102].",

Viremia is believed to occur from several days before onset of illness to a week after illness and has the potential for transmission by blood transfusion [103]. ZIKV-specific IgM antibodies develop during the first week of illness, but data on duration are limited [33]. IgG neutralizing antibodies develop shortly after IgM antibodies and probably persist for many years after infection to confer prolonged and possibly lifelong immunity [104]. However, this presumption is largely based on data from other related flaviviruses such as West Nile virus and yellow fever virus. There is no known antigenic variation of different genotypes; thus, immunity should be cross protective for isolates from different regions\nof origin, as there is no strain subtypes of ZIKV.",

The incubation period ranges from 1 to 12 days but averages 2\u20134 days, but unlike dengue asymptomatic infection is very uncommon, about 3\u201325% of people with serological evidence of infection [8]. A maculopapular, erythematous rash on the trunk with possible involvement of the face, limbs, palms, and soles can be present in 20\u201380% of patients and is rarely bullous in children [10]. Severe polyarthralgia, which can be disabling, is the hallmark of this disease, and debilitating polyarthralgia in endemic countries even with circulating DENV have a positive predictive value of 80% for CHIKV viremia [8, 105]. The arthralgia in dengue fever is usually milder and of shorter duration during first few days with fever. In CHIKV infection, polyarthralgia is usually symmetrical and involves joints of the arms and lower limbs [about 90%] and less often the spine, and large joints and small joints are frequently affected [8, 10]. Joints with previous damage from other disease such as osteoarthritis are often more severely affected with disabling arthritis. Swelling and periarticular edema\nmay be seen especially in the interphalangeal joints, wrists, and ankles and represent active arthritis, but joint effusions have not been a notable feature. Nonspecific symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, confusion, and weakness have been reported in large outbreaks of hospital referred patients [8].",

Autopsy of infected neonates and murine model of CHIKV infection have demonstrated brain pathological changes from the infection. Death rate following CHIKV infection was estimated to be 1:1000 cases in La Reunion outbreak [106] but is usually reported rarely in other outbreaks, and mortality is generally associated with multiple comorbid illness in the elderly or neonatal infection. These complicated cases may be associated with rare complications such as hemorrhage, liver dysfunction, renal failure, heart failure, and myocarditis [8, 10, 66].

Patients with joint pains up to 36% met the criteria for rheumatoid arthritis\nbut with negative rheumatoid factor, and MRI findings may include joint effusion, bony erosions, marrow edema, synovial thickening, tendinitis, and tenosynovitis [110]. Treatment of acute and chronic arthralgia of CHIKV infection is primarily the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [NSAIDs], and although methotrexate has been used for more disabling arthritis, there is no clinical trial with immunosuppressive agents [111].",

The initial phase is usually heralded by high fever, headaches, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea and vomiting, and sometimes a transient macular rash [80, 88]. Mild bleeding, bruising, and petechiae may be evident and an enlarged liver may be palpable. Although children have high fever, the other symptoms may be less severe than adults in this phase.

            "text": "A small proportion of susceptible patients, mainly children and young adults, may progress to the critical phase at the time of resolving fever [80, 88]. This stage of illness is characterized by worsening symptoms of weakness with systemic signs attributable to increased vascular permeability and leaky vessels. These consist of signs of hypotension and shock, associated with worsening and persistent vomiting, abdominal pain with tender hepatomegaly, development of pleural and peritoneal effusions, and subsequently bleeding from the mucosa, restlessness, and lethargy. Failure to institute adequate medical therapy may result in refractory shock, severe gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatorenal failure, encephalopathy, rarely myocarditis, and death. Results of laboratory tests at this phase usually reveal moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts often below 20 \u00d7 10\u22129 per liter, and increase in activated partial-thromboplastin time, and low fibrinogen may exhibit levels resembling but not typical for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy [80]. Up to two-thirds of patients may have hypokalemia, and hypokalemic paralysis is an underemphasized neuromuscular complication of severe DENV infection [113]. Elevated creatine kinase from rhabdomyolysis is seen occasionally [114], and acute kidney failure occurs in 2\u20135% of patients and carries a high mortality [115]. In a recent study of 796 pediatric patients, the most common findings included thrombocytopenia [96%], abdominal pain [71%], and vomiting [59%], but the most important factors associated with severe dengue were rash, severe thrombocytopenia, and anemia [116]. This critical phase is short-lived and lasts for 48\u201372 h with subsequent rapid recovery in the recovery phase in most cases. The mortality in patients with refractory shock, usually from late medical attention, can be up to 20% but with early appropriate treatment is usually very low, from 0.1% to 0.5% [88]. The critical phase is characterized by very low viremia, peak T-cell activation, and vasculopathy. Current evidence suggests that platelet and complement activation through antibody-mediated immune complex results in the combined effect of anaphylatoxins and inflammatory molecules and platelet sequestration results in vasculopathy [117]. Since 2009, the World Health Organization has replaced the 1997 classification of dengue/ dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome with dengue and severe dengue [118].",

A total of 7830 suspected cases were reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health by June 2016. Among a total of 5554 live-born infants with suspected microcephaly, investigation was completed on 1501 suspected cases [27%], of which 602 [40%] were considered definite or probable cases of congenital ZIKV neurological disorder [based on head circumference for gestational age below 2SD and specific neuroimaging findings [141]]. Rashes in the third trimester of pregnancy were associated with brain abnormalities despite normal head size [present in about 20% of definite or probable cases], but rash during pregnancy did not occur in a third of the affected cases. Distinctive neuroimaging findings included brain calcifications, ventricular enlargement, or both with negative serology for syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus; however, some of the probable cases had incomplete data to exclude these other congenital infections. Also reported at the same time is a case series [N = 5] of the pathological findings of congenital ZIKV syndrome [144]. In all three fatal cases with microcephaly, [two also had severe arthrogryposis] viral antigens were localized to glial cells and neurons and associated with microcalcification. ZIKV\nantigens were detected in chorionic villi of one of the first trimester placentas [with spontaneous abortion], and tissue samples from all five cases were positive for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR [144]. Thus, these findings provide strong evidence for ZIKV causing congenital central nervous system malformations, including microcephaly\n, arthrogryposis [flexion contracture of the limb/joint], and spontaneous abortion.",

Chloroquine or its derivative hydroxychloroquine have anti-inflammatory properties and have been used for rheumatological diseases for decades. However, clinical studies with chloroquine in CHIKV infection have produced mixed results. Early, small open clinical trial suggested that chloroquine might be beneficial for chronic arthralgia after CHIKV infection, but a later study of 27 patients with acute CHIKV treated with chloroquine compared to 27 controls showed no benefit and increased incidence of chronic arthralgia [146, 147]. Administration of specific CHIKV immunoglobulins harvested from recovered patients has high neutralizing activity and has been shown to have protective and therapeutic activity [within 24 h after inoculation] in the mouse model [75]. However, the potential use in an outbreak would be limited to specific high-risk scenarios such as neonates born to viremic mothers or adults with underlying rheumatological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Development of an effective CHIKV vaccine should be simpler than producing an effective DENV vaccine because of limited antigenic variation among genotypes and lack of antibody enhancement\n. Although several vaccines in phase 1 or preclinical studies are in development [148], marketing a commercially viable vaccine will be challenging. CHIKV outbreaks have been unpredictable, and to perform a phase 3 clinical trial would be difficult as disease surveillance declines after epidemics. Usually afflicted population would have long-lasting protection, and new outbreaks require a susceptible population at risk.",

The major concern of vaccine-induced disease\nfrom antibody enhancement has not been realized from vaccines that have been tested to date, likely from development of tetravalent vaccines to provide antibodies to all serotypes at the same time. Several DENV vaccines are in development at various stages, but the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine [Dengvaxia], developed over 20 years and the first dengue vaccine to be marketed and approved in Mexico in December 2015, for an initial phase with 40,000 people [children] to be inoculated. [htp://www.sanofipasteur.com/en/articles/dengvaxia-world-s-first-dengue-vaccine-approved-in-mexico.aspx]. The vaccine is a recombinant, live-attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine [CYD-TDV] composed of four chimeric live flaviviruses, each derived from the yellow fever virus genome with gene segments of each of the four DENV serotypes [142]. The vaccine was given to >35,000 children between the ages of 2 and 16 years in Asian-Pacific and Latin American countries as three subcutaneous injections given at months 0, 6, and 12 and assessed in three clinical trials [148\u2013151]. The vaccine efficacy after a 3 year assessment was shown to reduce dengue due to all four serotypes in nearly two-thirds of participants, and pooled analysis showed the vaccine prevented 9 out of 10 cases of severe dengue and 8 out of 10 hospitalizations in ages 9\u201316 years, but there was an unexplained higher incidence of hospitalization in children younger than 9 years of age [151]. This latter observation has to be carefully monitored during long-term follow-up to assess for antibody enhancement-induced disease. The vaccine was found to be safe and serious adverse event in the first 28 days of vaccination in the vaccine and control group was similar [each 1%] [151].",

Further studies by the same investigators have recently shown that three different vaccine platforms protect against ZIKV challenge in rhesus monkeys [155]. The purified inactivated virus vaccine induced ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies and completely protected against ZIKV challenge with strains from both Brazil and Puerto Rico. In addition, adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that purified immunoglobulin from vaccinated monkeys conferred passive protection. A plasmid DNA vaccine and a single-shot recombinant rhesus\nadenovirus vector expressing ZIKV prM-Env also completely protected monkeys against ZIKV challenge. Hence, rapid clinical development of a ZIKV vaccine for humans is a reality.",
