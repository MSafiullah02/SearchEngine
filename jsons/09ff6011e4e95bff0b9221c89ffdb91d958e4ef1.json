Design: a rapid and systematic review/critical appraisal Data sources: COVID-19 Open Research Dataset supplied by Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology as well as PubMed and Embase via Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Results: screening was undertaken 44,000 articles with a final selection of 25 studies referring to 18 different experimental projects related to the estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19. Findings: The majority of extant published estimates offer empirical evidence showing that the incubation period for the virus is a mean of 7.8 days, with a median of 5.01 days, which falls into the ranges proposed by the WHO (0 to 14 days) and the ECDC (2 to 12 days). Nevertheless, a number of authors proposed that quarantine time should be a minimum of 14 days and that for estimates of mortality risks a median time delay of 13 days between illness and mortality should be under consideration. It is unclear as to whether any correlation exists between the age of patients and the length of time they incubate the virus. Finally, it is generally agreed that robust precautions must be put in place for the prevention and/or mitigation of asymptomatic transmission to high-risk patients caused by those incubating the virus.",

            "text": "At the start of 2020, a new form of coronavirus was found to be the source of infection responsible for an epidemic of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, a region in which the first patients began to show symptoms in December 2019. At the time of writing (April 29, 2020) over 3 million people globally have caught the virus, of whom more than 200,000 have died. The novel virus, causing severe acute respiratory disease, is thought to be from the same family as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, but it is unique in its own right. This means that central epidemiological parameters, which includes the incubation period, are being urgently researched in real-time from case reports while the epidemic is continuing [1] . The incubation period of a virus represents the time span from the probable earliest contact with a source of transmission and the earliest recognition of the first symptoms. Accurately estimating the length of incubation period is essential for effective contemporary public health measures to be taken [2] . If health authorities know what the incubation period is then they will know for how long a healthy individual has to be monitored and have their movement restricted (quarantine period) [3] . Correctly estimating the incubation period will also help us to comprehend how infectious COVID-19 is, make estimations of the size of the pandemic, and decide on the best course of action [4, 5, 6, 7] . With insufficient data available to definitively state what the incubation period for this virus is, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is working with a broad range of 0-14 days, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDCDC) is working with a range of 2-14 days, and a number of studies have made the assumption that the incubation period is similar to that of the MERS and SARS coronaviruses [1] .",

            "text": "Various infectious/viral diseases have a variety of incubation periods. Nevertheless, for some infectious diseases, we are relatively certain about the incubation period. For every individual the level of pathogens invading the body, their ability to reproduce and resist treatment will differ, and so for any specific disease the data related to incubation periods should be treated with logarithm normal distribution [8] . Log-normal distribution represents the continuous probability distribution for a random variable with normal logarithm distribution. Incubation periods can usually be measured via biological experimentation and physiological observation. Accurately determining the incubation period will significantly influence controls to prevent transmission of the disease and official policy regarding it. Nevertheless, determining the incubation period for COVID-19 is no simple matter, due to the fact that there is no consistency in the quality of the available data. One reason for this is that generally we can only discover the times when the patient was in contact with persons carrying the virus, and then assume that the incubation period runs from the earliest date of exposure to the appearance of clinical symptoms or medical diagnosis. This way of calculating the incubation period may well be responsible for overestimation. This paper represents a systematic review of the literature in order to answer the essential question of what length the COVID-19 incubation period is. Due to the fact that no method currently exists that can make an accurate estimation of the incubation period, the only option is to draw lessons from past experience/practice.",

The data used by the authors was either directly harvested from government sources or from news websites reporting government statements. The data collection process was real-time, so it was added to as further details emerged. The final data selection represented a selection of reported cases up to January 31, 2020.

Mean time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital (either for treatment or isolation) was estimated to be between three and four days with no truncation and between five and nine days with right truncation.

To prevent the virus spreading, any individual who may have been exposed should go into isolation for 14 days, this being the outer limit of predictions for incubation times. Nevertheless, by analyzing a large dataset for this research, researchers report that no identifiable difference exists between incubation times for SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which highlights the requirement for more extensive and better-annotated datasets. This research covered 49 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who had definite dates for first exposure, end of exposure and beginning of symptoms, 153 patients with SARS-CoV, and 70 MERS-CoV patients; this data was amalgamated from seven separate papers. The results indicated that MERS incubates on average 5.8 days (95% CI: 5-6.5), SARS-CoV 4.7 days (95% CI: 4.3-5.1), and SARS-CoV2 4.9 days (95% CI: 4.4-5.5).

They took individual patient histories from COVID-19 subjects in China (not from Hubei Province) for estimating the distribution of the time for generation, incubation, and the time span between onset of symptoms and isolation/diagnosis. On average, patients were isolated 3.7 days after the onset of symptoms, and diagnosed after 6.6 days. The average patient was found to be infectious 3.9 days prior to displaying any notable symptoms. This militates against effective quarantining or contact tracing. With contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, the baseline reproduction number is estimated at 1.54, with the majority of infection attributable to super spreaders.

The researchers harvested data on the demographics, possible exposure, and time to symptom onset for confirmed cases published by local Chinese authorities. They assessed the possibilities of transmission in the course of the incubation period for 50 clusters of infection; these included 124 cases outwith Wuhan/Hubei province. Every secondary case examined and been in contact with a first-generation case prior to experiencing symptoms. This research found that the mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% CI, 4.4-5.4), with a range of 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile). The infectious curve demonstrated that 73% of secondary cases became infected prior to symptoms appearing for first-generation cases; this was especially the case in the final three days of incubation. These findings demonstrated that COVID-19 is transmitted between those who are in close contact in the course of incubation, which could indicate a weakness in the quarantine system. Robust workable countermeasures are required for the prevention or mitigation of the virus being transmitted asymptomatically amongst high-risk populations in the course of the incubation period. Juanjuan Z. [22] undertook research into the evolution of COVID-19's transmission dynamics and epidemiology outwith Hubei province. It was hoped that being able to understand the evolution of the transmission dynamics and epidemiology outwith the center of the epidemic would provide useful information that could be used as guidance for intervention policies. The researchers harvested data on individuals whose diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory testing in mainland China (apart from Hubei) that was reported by official public sources between January 19 and February 17, 2020. The date of the fourth time the case definition was revised (January 27) was employed as a means of dividing the epidemic into two phases (December 24-January 27 and January 28-February 17) as dates for symptom onset. Trends were estimated in terms of central time-event periods and subject demographics. This research encompassed 8579 cases, covering 30 provinces. The median age of the subjects was 44 years (range 33 to 56); as the epidemic continued, more cases emerged in the younger age groups and for the elderly (those aged over 64). Mean time between symptom onset and hospitalization fell from 4.4 days (% 95% CI 0.0-14.0) between December 24 and January 27, down to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) between January 28 and February 17. For the whole period, mean incubation period was calculated at 5.2 days (1. 8-12.4 ) with the mean serial interval being 5.1 days (1.3-11.6).",

The researchers undertook analysis of clinical data for 34 subjects submitting to elective surgery during the COVID-19 incubation period at four Chinese hospitals (Renmin, Tongji, Zhongnan, and Central) in Wuhan between January 1 and February 5, 2020. The patients had a median age of 55, with 20 of them (58.8%) being female. Every patient exhibited COVID-19 pneumonia symptoms within a short time of surgery, with abnormalities showing on chest CT scans. Symptoms exhibited by these patients encompassed fever (31 (91.2%)), fatigue (25 (73.5%)) and a dry cough (18 (52.9%)). 15 of the patients (44.1%) had to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as the disease progressed, and seven of these died (20.5%). Every patient examined in this research had being directly exposed to the environment in Wuhan before being admitted to hospital; no patient had exhibited any symptoms of COVID-19 prior to surgery. It was notable how swiftly the COVID-19 symptoms appeared once surgery had been completed, with the infection being confirmed by laboratory within a short period. The time gap between hospital admission and surgery (median time 2.5 days) is less than the median incubation period of 5.2 days found in patients with laboratory-confirmed infections in Wuhan [15] ; it is also less than the general incubation time in hospitals in China (median time 4.0 days, from research into infected patients from 552 Chinese hospitals [19] ). Taken together, this evidence is confirmation of the hypothesis that patients within this research were incubating COVID-19 prior to submitting to surgery.",

This research examined three COVID-19 clusters associated with a church in Singapore, a business conference, and a visiting Chinese tour group in February 2020. The research employed inpatient medical records and interviews to harvest clinical and epidemiological data regarding subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19; field investigations were undertaken for assessment of the ways these subjects had interacted with others and the potential ways in which they had acquired the virus. With overseas cases, open-source reports were used. At the time of the research (February 15, 2020) there were 36 infections with epidemiological links to the three Singaporean clusters mentioned above. 425 subjects who had had close contact with people from these clusters were put in quarantine. Those affected had generally had prolonged direct close contact with others, although it was not possible to exclude indirect transmission, e.g. through shared food or fomites. This research found a median incubation period for COVID-19 of four days (IQR 3-6). Serial intervals for transmission pairs were between three and eight days. The researchers came to the conclusion that the virus can be transmitted within communities and that local clusters of infection will appear in countries that welcomed high numbers of Chinese visitors prior to Wuhan being locked down and travel restrictions being imposed. The research further concluded that contact tracing and increased surveillance is necessary to prevent the virus spreading widely across communities. China Pei W. et al [29] undertook an investigation into COVID-19's epidemiological characteristics as found in the Chinese province of Henan, centered on publicly available data related to 1212 patients. The report mentions that these patients are 55% male and 45% female, with 81% being aged from 21 to 60 years. Statistical analysis undertaken with 483 patients on this cohort revealed that the estimated average median period was 7.4 days, the mode 4 days, and the median 7 days. 92% of patients did not have an incubation period in excess of 14 days.

            "text": "On the basis of this research, it appears that the only means of estimating the incubation period for COVID-19 at present is logarithm normal distribution. Novel ways of effecting improvements to the estimation's accuracy in terms of estimating incubation periods should be investigated. This is an important issue because date of infection and/or onset of symptoms are difficult to precisely identify. Nicholas G.R.et al [31] have made a comparison of two means of making such estimates. One method uses doubly interval-censored data, and the other employs data reduction techniques making the calculation more tractable. The researchers used both methods on historical data relating to the incubation periods for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A. The outcomes demonstrate that these methods reduce the demands for computational power to analyze the reduced data and make good estimates of median incubation times in many different experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the researchers do recommend that doubly interval-censored analysis should be used to estimate the distribution tails. The systematic review undertaken by this research has demonstrated that the current published estimations have offered empirical evidence that the virus' incubation period is approximately a median of 5.01 and a mean of 7.8 days, which falls into the 2 to 12 days assumption of the ECDC and the 0 to 14 days of the WHO [11]. Researchers like [2] propose a recommended quarantine length of a minimum of 14 days, suggesting that fatality risks should be estimated using a median time of 13 days between first symptoms and mortality. [14] offered evidence that it is possible for symptoms to appear once patients have left a 14 day period of quarantine or active monitoring; the authors suggest that the median incubation time is around five days, similar to SARS. In [16] , the authors stated that 14-day quarantines may be insufficient to protect the public in 6.7% of cases; they therefore proposed that quarantine should be a minimum of 22 days. In [19] it was found that eight patients developed symptoms after more than 14 days from infection. In [20] the authors referred to a patient who incubated the virus for 19 days, a substantial period but one which falls into the reported range (0-24 days).",

[13] states that COVID-19 has a mean incubation period lower than MERS coronavirus but higher than SARS coronavirus.
