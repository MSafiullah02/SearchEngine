            "text": "In the relatively new field of visual analytics there is a great need for automated approaches to both verify and discover the intentions and schemes of primary actors through time. Data mining and knowledge discovery play critical roles in facilitating the ability to extract meaningful information from large and complex textual-based (digital) collections. In this study, we develop a mathematical strategy based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) to extract and sequence important activities and specific events from sources such as news articles. The ability to automatically reconstruct a plot or confirm involvement in a questionable activity is greatly facilitated by our approach. As a variant of the PARAFAC multidimensional data model, we apply our NTF algorithm to the terrorism-based scenarios of the VAST 2007 Contest data set to demonstrate how term-by-entity associations can be used for scenario/plot discovery and evaluation.",

Tools for visual analytics are designed to synthesize information; derive insight from large, dynamic, and often conflicting data; and facilitate the mining of such data for both expected and unexpected associations that can be both verified and easily communicated. The discipline of visual analytics is very interdisciplinary and extends well beyond traditional scientific and information visualization to include statistics, mathematics, knowledge representation, management and discovery technologies, cognitive and perceptual sciences, and decision sciences. In this study, we use nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) techniques to extract term-by-entity associations from textual data describing the activities and events associated with a possible terrorism-based plot. As shown in [1] , nonnegative tensor factorization based on the well-known PARAFAC [2] model for multidimensional data can be effective in extracting important topics of discussions from media such as electronic mail. How such tensor factorizations would fare for (automatically) exposing the major (or sub-major) plots of a scenario hidden in the details of news stories, blog entries, and similar textual data was the question we sought to address in this work. The fictitious terrorist activities created by Whiting et al. for the VAST 2007 Contest [3] provide an excellent example of textual data that is needed to address that fundamental question. We will first describe the scenario provided by this data set in Section 2 followed by a discussion of our methods of analysis using NTF in Section 3. Details of how the data was processed are provided in Section 4, and our analysis and observations using NTF are summarized in Section 5. Concluding remarks and a brief discussion of future work are given in Section 6.",

The data set associated with the contest consisted of news stories and blog entries, along with background information and some multimedia materials (small maps and data tables). Participants in the contest were asked to investigate a major law enforcement/counter-terrorism scenario, form their hypotheses, and collect supporting evidence. Tasks that each team/entry was expected to address included i) processing the text and multimedia information to identify entities of interest (e.g., people, places and activities), ii) depicting this information visually using interactive visualizations and other tools to aid in the analysis of the information; iii) answering specific contest questions based on the analysis; and iv) producing a video demonstration of their system showing how they arrived at those answers. In our study, we demonstrate the use of nonnegative tensor factorization for (automated) knowledge discovery that would facilitate the first three of the tasks mentioned above.",

Given a third-order tensor X of size m \u00d7 n \u00d7 p and a desired approximation rank r, the PARAFAC model approximates X as a sum of r rank-1 tensors formed by the outer product of three vectors. It is convenient to group each set of r vectors together as matrices A, B, and C, which we call factor matrices. We may express the PARAFAC model in a number of ways using different notations.

These preliminary results are quite promising and suggest that NTF may become an effective tool for the emerging discipline of visual analytics. Further research in the effects of scaling/weighting of the attributes defining the initial tensor (or data array) is needed along with the incorporation of the underlying NTF model into a visual interface more suitable for human steering and querying. \"I urge your readers to not use Global Ways...low survival rates, poor packaging, poor responsiveness. We will never use them again... the packaging on my last shipment of Tigrinus Catfish was abominable. Shipping bags were covered in some noxious substance that caused our handlers hands to go numb and eventually need emergency medical treatment. You can imagine the condition of the fish themselves. Less than 10% survived their trip.\" 2 \"In response to these comments, Global Ways spokesman blamed an inexperienced packer in South America for problems in a very few shipments. We are working with these customers and have guaranteed them satisfaction. A problem occurred in a very small number of the 5000 shipments we handled last quarter.\" 3 \"The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is warning ornamental fish merchants not to handle any shipments of tropical catfish from South America that may have come into the United States through Miami, as the packaging bags may be contaminated with a substance that can cause serious illness.

More than 50 possible cases are being investigated.\" 3 \"But as the monkeypox outbreak shows, there are risks in owning exotic pets. Now that two people have died from a new, more potent strain, the mishmash of regulations leaves loopholes that have allowed sick animals to travel, health officials say. Chinchillas, believed to be the cause of the recent outbreak and on the endangered species lists, are part of that concern.\" 4 \"Cesar Gil, an animal rights activist and chinchilla breeder in the LA area, is currently being sought in connection with the monkeypox outbreak.
