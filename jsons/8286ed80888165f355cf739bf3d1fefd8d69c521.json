            "text": "Background: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China and subsequently developed into an ongoing epidemic. Understanding epidemiological factors characterising the transmission dynamics of this disease is of fundamental importance. Aims: This study aimed to describe key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Methods: We extracted data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from the publicly available information released by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection. We used doubly interval censored likelihood to estimate containment delay and serial interval, by fitting gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions to respective empirical values using Bayesian framework with right truncation. A generalised linear regression model was employed to identify factors associated with containment delay. Secondary attack rate was also estimated. Results: The empirical containment delay was 6.39 days; whereas after adjusting for right truncation with the best-fit Weibull distribution, it was 10.4 days (95% CrI: 7.15 to 19.81). Containment delay increased significantly over time. Local source of infection and number of doctor consultations before isolation were associated with longer containment delay. The empirical serial interval was 4.58-6.06 days; whereas the best-fit lognormal distribution to 26 certain-and-probable infector-infectee paired data gave an estimate of 4.77 days (95% CrI: 3.47 to 6.90) with right-truncation. The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%. Conclusion: With a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement. Our study highlights the transmission risk of social interaction and pivotal role of physical distancing in suppressing the epidemic.",

In fact, for previous outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, such transmission risk is documented. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, 16 .1% probable cases were attributable to household transmission [10] . Three generations of secondary infections, featured by a history of direct contacts, were also observed in the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea [11] . To this end, with the first 53 cases in Hong Kong, this study addresses four epidemiological aspects of COVID-19: (i) quantifying delay in isolating confirmed cases from symptom onset (thereafter denoted as 'containment delay'); (ii) exploring factors associated with the containment delay; (iii) estimating the clinical-onset serial interval (thereafter denoted as 'serial interval'); and (iv) estimating the secondary attack rate.",

Moreover, in Hong Kong the containment delay increased over time whereas it declined considerably in Singapore [25] . Factors affecting the containment delay in Hong Kong were found to be the source of infection (with shorter delays for imported cases than local ones) and the number of doctor consultations before isolation. The progressive increase of the containment delay appeared to reflect the varying transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Most early cases in Hong Kong were imported from other places in China, such that recent travel (in China) was initially considered a risk factor of infection. As the epidemic progressed and restrictions at the border were put in place, travel history could no longer be a criterion for diagnosis. The absence of rapid diagnostic tools, together with the non-specific symptoms of COVID-19, which can overlap with those of other respiratory illnesses that were occurring during the winter influenza season, jointly increased the difficulty to discern SARS-CoV-2 infections. This also explains the positive association between containment delay and the number of doctor consultations before isolation.",

Nevertheless, a longer serial interval was reported by Li and colleagues (mean: 7.5 days; 95% CI: 5.3-19.0) [27] and Bi and colleagues (6.3 days) [24] . It should be noted however, that in the current study, data certainty considerably affected the serial interval estimates (which differed by 1.5 days depending if both certain and probable paired data were used, or if only certain paired data were used).

            "text": "Our study has several public health implications. First the vague differences between COVID-19 and other co-circulating respiratory diseases, which may have impacted on the containment delay, suggest the need for active screening of COVID-19. On 19 February 2020, the Hong Kong government implemented the Enhanced Laboratory Surveillance Programme to collect deepthroat specimens from outpatients for active diagnosis [29] . The extent to which this programme reduced containment delay remains to be quantified. Nevertheless, despite its unclear immediate benefit, this heightened surveillance network could collect data of long-term investigational value. Second, the short serial interval (4.77 days) of COVID-19 can impede contact tracing. As cases were generated quickly through transmission chains, health officials had to race against time to trace contacts. The serial interval also appeared to be somewhat shorter than the reported incubation period for COVID-19 (which is on average 5-6 days [27, 30, 31] , and can be up to 14 days [19] ), suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission could have occurred ( Figure S3 ). This finding was in line with the results of work by Du and colleagues [26] , who delineated that among reports of transmission between infector-infectee, 12.6% were due to pre-symptomatic transmission. The short serial interval, combined with pre-symptomatic transmission, containment delay (which fosters symptomatic transmission) and high secondary attack rate (which is almost double than that of SARS (6.3%) [32] ) suggests that collective and drastic physical-distancing policies, such as limiting the size of people gatherings, issuing stay-at-home order, mass closure of public venues or even city lockdown may be needed to contain the COVID-19 epidemic. Should these non-pharmaceutical interventions not work, we might need to resort to cautiously enhancing population herd immunity [33] .",

Presymptomatic transmission [34] and containment delay (as identified in the current study) eased the penetration of COVID-19 into long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in the United States. Elderly persons with comorbidities have been shown to be vulnerable to COVID-19 and to be likely to experience severe outcomes [35] . The identification in March 2020 of COVID-19 in 30 LTCFs in the United States [36] as well as the report of a considerable number of deaths in elderly homes in Italy [37] point to the potential for imminent outbreaks in these settings. Besides LTCFs, based on past experience from nosocomial outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, such as the ones responsible for SARS in Hong Kong in 2003 [38] and MERS in South Korea in 2015 [11] , attention should be paid to inpatients hospitalised for other illnesses than COVID-19, who might be in the presymptomatic stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, keeping alert to patients who might have symptoms not yet recognised as being due to COVID-19 may also be important. Kraemer et al. reported that from the onset of COVID-19, the time to confirmation (onsetto-confirmation time: 6.17 days) was longer than the No.: number; SI: serial interval in days.",

Model 1 explores the association of the containment delay and different periods of the outbreak after adjusting for age and sex. Model 2 explores the association between the containment delay and the potential source of infection after adjusting for age and sex. Model 3 explores the association between the containment delay and the number of doctor consultations before isolation after adjusting for age, sex and presence of comorbidities.time to hospitalisation (onset-to-hospitalisation time: 2.96 days)[22], suggesting that outbreaks of COVID-19 in hospitals were possible. In fact, among the first 53 cases in Hong Kong, there were three cases (cases 12, 17, and 29) hospitalised for illnesses other than COVID-19 who turned out to be confirmed cases of COVID-19 as well. In addition to LTCFs and hospitals, the positive association between number of doctor consultations and containment delay in our study pinpoints the exposure of outpatient settings to COVID-19. Therefore, guideline on patient flow management for outpatient settings would reduce the cross infections that can arise from their packed environments.Fourth, this study offers useful information to the scientific community and policymakers, particularly input for mathematical forecasting models. It presents several aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and tries to link them up to profile the course of the epidemic. The intrinsic epidemiological properties captured in this study can be of reference value to countries where drastic interventions have not yet been implemented.",
