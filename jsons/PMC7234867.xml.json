We understand the need of some guidelines, but we do not understand the affirmation \u2018prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with systemic anticancer treatment should be considered\u2019,\n1 appearing in different parts of the manuscript and that seems to suggest that during the infection these factors should be used more frequently than what it is recommended in guidelines2 and therefore have a protective role. We do not agree with this suggestion, since the severity of this infection seems to be more correlated with a cytokine release picture than with a conventional sepsis or infection and that the haemophagocytic syndrome that critically ill infected patients present is characterised by the increase in various interleukins, and even the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, among others, and that cytopaenias are more explained by immune phenomenon3 than as a consequence of treatments.",

The patients we have treated in Spain showed that severity is more associated to an hyperinflammatory syndrome than with a standard sepsis situation, in a context of neutropaenic infection and therefore granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for SARS-CoV-2 may not be useful and even harmful if we treat lung cancer patients with G-CSF.",
