Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the transport of salbutamol sulfate through the differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells and Calu-3 cell line (HTB-55). Method: Human primary bronchial epithelial and Calu-3 cells were cultured at an air-liquid interface for at least 21 days and 11 days respectively. Salbutamol sulfate (SS) in dry powder form was deposited on the cell layers using a twin stage impinger (TSI) at the flow rate of 60 L/min for 4 seconds. The transport of the SS was studied over 4 hours. Drug penetration across cell layers was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: The percentage of transported SS through differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (n = 4) at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 180, 210 and 240 mins had a positive relationship with the amount of SS dry powder deposited on the cell layers (p < 0.05). However, this relationship was not apparent with Calu-3 cells (p > 0.05, n = 4). Conclusion: To study the transport of salbutamol sulfate dry powder after deposition on the epithelial cells, differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells would be more representative of in vivo physiological transport rate of SS than Calu-3. Furthermore, the data could suggest that the dose of SS taken by the patients and deposited in the airways correlates with the transport of SS through the airway epithelium, which in turn would affect the concentration of the drug at airway smooth muscle level.",

Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular responses of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) to neat and modified diesel emissions at an air-liquid interface (ALI). Method: Primary HBECs, established at the UQ Thoracic Research Centre, were cultured and differentiated at ALI for 28 days. The functional characteristics of the cell layer were determined with a series of stains assessing cilia growth and mucus production. Primary HBECs were exposed to diesel emissions generated at the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health. HBEC responses to diesel emissions were measured as cell viability and cytokine secretion . Results: The HBECs demonstrated a mucociliary phenotype after 28 days of differentiation at ALI. Neat diesel emissions caused a reduction in cell viability and increases in cytokine secretion. This was attenuated by the removal of the organic content from particles. Results are summarized in the table below. N = 3, \u00b1SEM, *indicates a significant difference (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Primary HBEC responses to diesel emissions are sensitive to composition and organic content may be a strong mediator of the adverse health effects associated with diesel emission exposure.",

            "text": "Background: St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne offers a specialist referral clinic for patients with suspected or proven thoracic malignancy, providing a multidisciplinary diagnostic and management approach. This service is a major tertiary referral centre for regional and metropolitan patients in Victoria. A number of patients referred to the service are found not to have malignant disease. The spectrum of benign diagnoses and tumour characteristics of those patients with malignant diagnoses has not been examined previously. Aim: To evaluate the demographics, final diagnoses (both benign and malignant), tumour characteristics and investigations performed on patients referred to this specialist service for suspected or proven thoracic malignancy. Method: A retrospective audit of the St Vincent's Hospital Combined Lung Clinic database was conducted from January 2009 to January 2013 inclusive. All referrals obtained were reviewed from the initial workup to diagnosis. Results: There were 1236 referrals to the Combined Lung Clinic of which 813 were primary lung cancers, 56 mesotheliomas, 138 metastatic thoracic lesions, 4 malignant lesions with an unidentified primary site and 225 benign lesions. The benign lesions included a wide spectrum of pathology and were diagnosed using combination of modalities including surgical intervention, interventional radiology, bronchial endoscopy and surveillance imaging. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary clinic for the investigation and management of known or suspected thoracic malignancy requires access to a wide range of diagnostic tools and specialty services as well as knowledge of the management of a wide range of benign conditions and malignant disease other than primary lung cancer. Diagnostic and management decisions are complex and require the involvement of multiple specialties. While a thoracic surgical service is an important component of this clinic, there are many patients who have advanced primary lung cancer, benign disease or a secondary malignancy who benefit from the involvement of other specialist services.",

            "text": "Introduction: The time of diagnosis of lung cancer is a very traumatic period for the patient. There is scant literature regarding the needs of the lung cancer patient at the time of diagnosis. This is important to ensure we target resources to needs of patients during this period. The Southern Rapid Access Lung Cancer Clinic is a joint clinic run by specialist physician and a specialist lung cancer nurse. This has a cohort of patients who are jointly evaluated and care coordinated at the time of diagnosis. Aims: To accurately determine the needs of the lung cancer patient at the time of diagnosis. Methods: We identified a cohort of patients in the Southern Rapid Access Lung Cancer Clinic and performed a needs analysis at the time of diagnosis. Results: The following domains were assessed -medical communication, psychological, emotional, daily living, financial, respiratory symptoms, spiritual/ existential, social. Amidst all the domains the highest needs indicated by 71% of respondents were in the domain of medical communication. Interestingly respiratory symptoms and financial issues were the domains were majority of respondents scored where there were no significant needs. Conclusion: This pilot survey suggests the major need felt by the patient with lung cancer at the time of diagnosis is in the domain of medical communication. Resources need to be targeted to supporting the patient by providing prompt and accurate information. This includes results of investigation, staging process, treatment options and prognosis. Respiratory symptoms and finances were minor issues for respondents newly diagnosed to have lung cancer. There is limited published data looking at 5-year survival for primary Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) particularly from Australian cohorts. Methods: Local clinical practice information was collected in a prospective database. Cases presented at a multidisciplinary lung cancer meeting over a 24-month period (April 2006 -March 2008 were analysed. Patients with NSCLC were identified (n = 181). Survival data were obtained for all NSCLC cases (n = 181/181) via hospital and general practitioner records as well as the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. Lung cancer stage was based on the 6th edition IASLC TNM classification. Mortality data and survival times were calculated according to clinical stage. Results: Five year survival was 10.5% (19/181) for all stages of NSCLC. Stratified by stage, 5-year survival was: Stage I 25% (13/52), Stage II 25% (3/12), Stage III 6% (3/52) and Stage IV 0% (0/65). Overall median survival was 7 months and when stratified by stage was: 30 months for Stage I, 5.5 months for Stage II, 9.1 months for Stage III and 3 months for stage IV disease. Patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent had a 60% 5-year survival (13/22) which is in keeping with other published Australian data. Conclusion: The 5-year survival rates for Stage II, III and IV NSCLC were comparable with that of internationally published cohorts. In contrast, all-cause mortality rates for Stage I NSCLC appear higher than expected; however, rates of surgical cure are in keeping with published data.",

MDSC numbers increase in NSCLC and are implicated in response to therapy, potentially reducing immunity through production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and by increasing L-arginine conversion to nitric oxide and nitrite/nitrate (NOx). Aim: This study aimed to assess NOx generation, and IL-10 and S100A9 levels in serum and EBC from patients with NSCLC. Controls included smokers and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as smoking is known to cause NSCLC and many individuals with NSCLC also have COPD. Asthma acted as a benign control inflammatory disorder. Methods: Samples from subjects with NSCLC were compared with those from COPD, asthma, healthy smokers, ex-smokers and never-smokers. S100A9 and IL-10 levels in serum and EBC were assessed using enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and NOx using a modified fluorometric adaptation of the Griess method.",

            "text": "THOMAS R 1, 2, 3 Aim: Human breath contains volatile biomarkers that could be used to diagnose lung diseases, which may be achieved by FAIMS technology. This method separates gas-phase ions at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. Compounds are ionized and passed through an asymmetric charged field. Ions are separated by their mobility under this varying electric field. A compensation voltage (CV) is used to filter the ions through the electrode channel to the detector. Using the range of the dispersion field (DF), different ionizable entities in the breath can be detected. The aim was to adapt FAIMS to first analyse breath from normal subjects intending to later map diagnostic ion patterns in lung diseases. Methods: Breath from normal healthy subjects was cooled on ice. The exhaled breath condensate (EBC) was retained, while the gaseous phase was mixed with dry clean air and drawn into the FAIMS analyser under negative pressure. In a separate experiment, the EBC collected previously was vapourized by negative pressure and analysed in a similar manner. Results: Breath water vapour generates a dominant, overwhelming signal when the humidity of the sample is higher than 10%. At <10% humidity, accomplished by condensing breath water and mixing with dry air, FAIMS showed similar spectra in healthy subjects. Food or beverages consumed by the subjects prior to breath analysis added additional peaks to the spectra, indicating that these will need to be assessed in breathprint analysis. ",

The main outcome was the patient journey from symptom onset to diagnosis. Type of referrer, journey times and diagnosis were extracted from hospital electronic records for all patients referred. Investigation patterns, out-of-pocket expenses, patient-perceptions of care, and travel and accommodation needs were obtained from self-reported questionnaires mailed to consenting patients at the time of referral and one-month following. Results: Of 107 eligible patients identified, 45 (42.1%) returned questionnaires. Times to referral and first specialist appointment; patterns of referral, investigations and diagnosis; and patient perceptions of care were similar for non-urban and urban patients. Total out-of-pocket expenses were significantly greater for non-urban patients (median, $133 non-urban and $40 urban, p = 0.03) and distance from residential address to the hospital correlated strongly with days off paid work (r = 0.90, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Non-urban patients with suspected lung cancer incurred higher out-of-pocket expenses and more days off paid work, but were otherwise not significantly disadvantaged during their journey to diagnosis compared to urban patients.",

However, the performance of EBUS-TBNAhas not been well studied in regional centres. EBUS was first introduced in our centre servicing Northern Tasmania in November 2012. Here, we report our single-operator experience with EBUS-TBNA compared with the existing practice of conventional TBNA with regard to its clinical utility, diagnostic accuracy and safety. EBUS-TBNAwas superior to conventional TBNAin evaluating for malignancy, with higher sensitivity (89.47% vs. 68.42%) and higher negative predictive value (83.3% vs. 50.0%). The diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA for sarcoidosis was 100%. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that EBUS-TBNA can be performed safely and effectively in a regional centre while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy comparable to major tertiary centres. Therefore, we conclude that it is feasible to perform EBUS-TBNA in regional centres. No major complications were observed during the study period.",

Their underlying aetiology may be due to a variety of processes 2 including infection, neoplasms and vasculitides. Moreover, a diagnosis of infection or abscess often requires the exclusion of other processes. A number of investigations are used to identify the cause including bronchoscopy and biopsy. Therefore, the process of achieving a final diagnosis (aetiology of the cavity) can be prolonged and challenging. We sought to determine the aetiology of the lesions diagnosed in our region over the last three years and the clinical utility of diagnostic procedures. Methods: All of the patients (n = 1426) whom underwent bronchoscopy at Flinders Medical Centre from 31/05/2010 to 31/05/2013 were assessed for the radiological evidence of pulmonary cavitary lesion(s). 24 patients were identified and case notes were reviewed. Results: 83.8% of twenty four cases (n = 20) were identified to have infectious aetiology. The total duration to achieve final diagnosis varied from 3 to 139 days however 41.7% were diagnosed in less than 10 days. In 17 out of 24 cases (70.8%), bronchoscopy enabled a diagnosis. CRP and wall thickness were not predictive of, or associated with final diagnosis. Tuberculosis was not identified in this cohort. Conclusion: Bronchoscopy remains a useful tool for diagnosis. Considerable delays in achieving the final diagnosis were observed in a minority of cases. A diagnostic algorithm may reduce the delays in diagnosis. Introduction: Flexible-rigid pleuroscopy is a useful tool in the workup of pleural effusions but the small biopsy channel often limits the size of tissue obtained especially in patients with thickened pleura. This pilot study evaluated the usefulness and safety of using a cryoprobe to obtain parietal pleural biopsies during flexi-rigid pleuroscopy. Method: Single centre prospective pilot study. Diagnostic pleuroscopy was performed in patients with suspected pleural malignancies using a flexi-rigid pleuroscope by one of two experienced operators. Additional cryoprobe biopsies were obtained when the operator has completed the standard pleuroscopic examination and biopsies using flexible forceps (FFB) \u00b1 rigid forceps (RFB) via a second entry port. A flexible autoclavable cryoprobe (2.4 mm diameter) was activated for 3 seconds to obtain cryobiopsies. All biopsy sites were assessed for bleeding. Histological samples were reviewed in random order by a specialist respiratory pathologist blinded to patient identity and biopsy technique. Introduction: Adequate analgesia in pleural procedures remains a challenge in interventional pulmonology. Methoxyflurane has an established profile in managing severe pain in trauma medicine, and has the advantage of being a patient-controlled analgesia with minimal risks of respiratory depression. Aim: To assess the efficacy and tolerance of methoxyflurane during pleural procedures.",

Patients inhaled methoxyflurane prior to standard local anaesthetic infiltration at the procedural site. IV access was available for supplementary opiate analgesia as needed. Patient and operator questionnaires regarding efficacy and tolerance of methoxyflurane were conducted after pleural procedures and the dose of opiate required was recorded. Results: Eighteen invasive pleural procedures were performed during this time period, with mean age of 74 years (range 43-94). Pleural procedures included 12 intercostal catheter insertion (14 Fr, Seldinger technique), one pleural aspiration, two tunnelled intercostal catheters, two medical pleuroscopies and one tunnelled intercostal catheter removal. Underlying pathology was malignant in seven cases. Average pain score was 2.9/10 during and 1.7/10 post-procedure, which correlated well with operator reported pain scores of 2.2/10. Average anxiety levels were 4.4/10. Cough was the most commonly reported side effect occurring in 22%. No patient required additional opiate analgesia during the procedure. Methoxyflurane was well tolerated, and 77% of patients would be happy to use it in future procedures.

In individuals with peanut allergy, asthma is a risk factor for anaphalaxis with risk increasing in proportion to asthma severity. Retrospective studies of childhood peanut allergy demonstrate serum IgE levels against the peanut allergen Ara h2 and skin prick tests (SPT) may help predict a clinical reaction at food challenge. It is unclear whether use of FeNO in conjunction with SPT and/or specific IgE to Ara h2 is of diagnostic value in predicting peanut allergy. Aim: To explore the utility of FeNO as a non-invasive screening tool for children suspected to have peanut allergy before an oral food challenge (OFC). Method: We recruited 53 participants from a cohort of consecutive children scheduled for an open-labelled peanut OFC by their Paediatric Allergist. Participants underwent SPT for sensitization to whole peanut extract and serum was collected for Ara h2 specific IgE. FeNO was also measured in all cooperative children before the challenge. OFC and assessment of reaction was undertaken by clinicians blinded to test results. Introduction: Heated humidified high-flow air via nasal prong (HFNP) with added oxygen (O2) can be used to provide O2 and continuous positive pressure (CPAP) to infants needing inpatient respiratory support. HFNP therapy may be used for the same indications as traditional CPAP delivered via nasopharyngeal tube or face-mask. The technology to deliver HFNP in the outpatient setting has recently become commercially available. Outpatient HFNP therapy may be better tolerated than standard mask CPAP. HFNP also offers more convenient delivery interface, and nasal cannulae may avoid the side effects associated with long term facemask use. Aim: To describe our experience using HFNP therapy for infants in the outpatient setting. Methods: A retrospective chart review of infants <24 months of age discharged home on HFNP therapy between 2012-13 from a tertiary paediatric hospital. Results: 4 infants (3 M/1 F) 24-39 weeks gestation were identified. All required prolonged ventilation and developed chronic lung disease. Co-morbidities included pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, pulmonary hypertension, craniofacial and airway abnormalities (laryngomalacia, tracheobronchomalacia) and genetic conditions (Noonan's, chromosome 9 deletion). All were commenced on HFNP therapy as inpatients (aged 5-15 months) following unsuccessful wean from CPAP to low flow oxygen prior to discharge. Indications for outpatient HFNP therapy included an inability to tolerate face-mask CPAP (2), CPAP unsuccessful due to inappropriate mask fit and parental refusal for tracheostomy, CPAP dependent but care-givers assessed as unable to manage CPAP or tracheostomy. Duration of outpatient HFNP therapy: 1 day (just discharged) to 2 years. No complications secondary to HFNP therapy recorded. Conclusion: HFNP O2 therapy has been used successfully to support the discharge of patients who were unable to wean from standard CPAP to low flow oxygen.",

Although eczema and atopy are recognized as risk factors for severe asthma, the factors associated with recovery following exacerbations are not well understood. Aims: In children with hospitalized and non-hospitalized asthma exacerbations, to (a) describe the point prevalence of respiratory viruses/atypical bacteria using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and (b) evaluate the impact of respiratory viruses/atypical bacteria, eczema and atopy on acute severity and clinical recovery. Methods: 244 children aged 2-16 years presenting with acute asthma to the Emergency Departments of 2 hospitals were recruited. A nasopharyngeal aspirate and allergen skin prick test were performed. Asthma quality of life questionnaires for parents (PACQLQ) and validated daily diary scores for asthma were recorded for 21 and 14 days, respectively. Results: PCR for viruses/atypical bacteria was positive in 81.7% of children (75.1% human rhinovirus, co-detection in 14.2%). M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were rarely detected. The presence of micro-organisms had little impact on acute asthma or recovery outcomes. Children with eczema had significantly slower asthma recovery, i.e. higher asthma diary scores on days 7, 10 and 14 (\u03b2 = 0.47, 95%CI 0.09,0.85, p = 0.015; \u03b2 = 0.49, 95%CI 0.10,0.88, p = 0.015; \u03b2 = 0.40, 95%CI 0.02,0.78, p = 0.041 respectively) whereas children with atopy were significantly more likely to relapse and re-present for medical care by day 14 (OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.00,1.23, p = 0.042). Conclusions: Viruses are associated with asthma exacerbations but do not appear to influence asthma recovery.

            "text": "BANTON G 1,2 , BENNETT C 2 , HALL G 1 , SIMPSON S 1 1 Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, 2 Deakin University Introduction: Recent improvements in neonatal care have resulted in viability of infants at lower gestational ages, and increased numbers of very preterm survivors (<32 weeks gestation), including many with brochopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Little is known about whether this generation of very preterm survivors experience increased persistence of respiratory symptoms compared to their full-term peers. Aim: We aimed to compare persistence of symptoms between preterm and full-term children, and investigate whether there are early life factors that can predict those children likely experience persistent symptoms. Methods: Pearson's chi squared tests were used to compare persistence of symptoms between 400 full-term children and 194 very preterm children, 123 with and 71 without BPD. Retrospectively collected neonatal information and respiratory symptom data including incidence of cough and wheeze at 1, 5 and 8-11 years of age were collated from previously collected research databases. Persistence was deemed as presence of the symptom at any two or more time points. Logistic regression was used to investigate early life predictors for persistent cough and wheeze in preterm children. Results: Preterm children were more likely to experience persistent cough (OR: 4.6, 95% CI 3.1-6.9) and wheeze (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.2) compared to full-term children. There was no difference in persistence of cough and wheeze between very preterm children with and without BPD. Very preterm children who experienced higher incidence of upper and lower respiratory tract infections during the first year of life were more likely to have persistent cough and wheeze. Conclusions: Very preterm children are more likely to have persistent symptoms compared to their full-term peers, and those who experience respiratory tract infections during the first year of life are most at risk. This highlights the importance of protecting these infants from respiratory infections, which may help to reduce persistent symptoms later in life. Aim: Bronchiectasis is a major contributor to chronic respiratory morbidity and mortality worldwide. Wheeze and other asthma-like symptoms and airway hyper-responsiveness may occur in people with bronchiectasis. Physicians often use asthma treatments in patients with bronchiectasis. Method: The Cochrane Airways Group performed a literature search, in accordance with Cochrane methodology. This included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and clinical trial registers. Inclusion criterion were all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of combined ICS and LABA compared to a control (placebo, no treatment, ICS as monotherapy) in children and adults with bronchiectasis not related to cystic fibrosis (CF). Results: 51 abstracts were reviewed. We included one RCT that compared combined ICS and LABA with high dose ICS in 40 adults with non-CF bronchiectasis. We assessed it to be an RCT with overall high risk of bias. Data analysed in this review showed that those who received combined ICS-LABA (in stable state) had significantly better transition dyspnoea index (mean difference [MD] 1.29, 95%CI 0.40, 2.18) and cough-free days (MD 12.30, 95%CI 2.38, 22. 2) compared to those on ICS after 3 months of treatment. There was no significant difference between groups in quality of life, number of people with one or more exacerbation or lung function. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence in the current literature to make reasonable conclusions about the efficacy of combined ICS-LABA in adults or children with bronchiectasis. Until further evidence is available, we recommend that therapy be individualized based on the presence or absence of co-existing airway hyper-responsiveness and consideration of adverse events associated with combined ICS-LABA. We report a young girl who presented with recurrent episodes of cough, wheeze and dyspnoea in early childhood. She was trialled on asthma medication but continued to suffer from frequent lower respiratory tract infections and at 5 years of age was admitted to ICU with bilateral patchy lung consolidations, fever, cough, and severe respiratory distress. She was noted to have melaena, iron deficiency anaemia, and needed a blood transfusion and a Salmonella-positive stool sample was detected. Over the next 6 months she continued to have frequent chest infections and small amounts of haemoptysis for which she was further investigated. Her chest x-ray (CXR) during an acute episode showed bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and bilateral consolidation with ground glass opacities. A CT chest showed bronchiectatic changes in right lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was blood stained and lung biopsy confirmed haemosiderin-laden macrophages. After exclusion of infective, cardiac, immunological and glomerular causes, she was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis.",

Introduction: Exposure to intrauterine hypoxia occurs due to a variety of maternal, foetal and/or placental factors. Respiratory outcome of the infant following birth depends on the duration and/or severity of the hypoxic insult. Aim: Here, we determine the effect of maternal chronic hypoxia during late gestation in sheep on the expression of genes regulating foetal lung liquid reabsorption and maturation of the surfactant system. These are vital processes that aid the successful transition to air-breathing at birth. Methods: Chronically catheterized pregnant sheep were exposed to normoxia (n = 8) or hypoxia (n = 7; 10% O2) from 105-138 d (term, \u223c145 d). At 138 d, foetuses were delivered, measured and their tissues collected. qRT-PCR was used to quantify lung mRNA expression of genes regulating sodium and water reabsorption, as well as the surfactant proteins (SP). These included amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENAC ) -\u03b1, -\u03b2 & -\u03b3 subunits, sodium potassium active transport pump (ATPase) -\u03b11 & -\u03b21 subunits, aquaporin (AQP) -1, -4 & -5 and SP-A, -B, -C & -D. Data were analysed using the Student's unpaired t-test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Exposure to hypoxia reduced the maternal PaO2 (106 \u00b1 2 vs. 47 \u00b1 1 mmHg).

However conventional pulmonary function testing performed in clinical practice does not adequately assess the function of small airways. Newer measures of small airway function such as Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) and Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) may facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis and evolution of small airway disease in children post BMT. Aim: To assess the feasibility of measuring small airway function in children post BMT using MBW and FOT. Methods: A cross sectional study of children over three years of age at a large BMT clinic, at varying times post BMT will be performed. The primary diagnosis of patients recruited are limited to Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) and Myelodysplasia which all share similar conditioning regimens pre BMT. Results: To date, five patients, 3 male, age ranging 4 to 18 years have been recruited and tested. The median age at BMT was 9.0 years (range 3-10) and the median time post BMT was 2.0 years (range 1-9 years). All five patients had allogeneic transplants (4 unrelated donor, 1 fully matched sibling), all patients performed MBW and FOT and 3/5 patients had evidence of peripheral airway abnormalities. Median LCI was 9.2 (range 6.15-12.75). Median Sacin was 0.13 (range 0.080-0.46) and median Scond was 0.073 (range 0.02-0.09). At 6 Hz median resistance was 6.73 (range 3.05-8) and median reactance was \u22122.10 (range \u22121.13-2.71). Conclusion: It is feasible for children post BMT to perform MBW and FOT tests. Small airways involvement as assessed by MBW and FOT can be seen in post BMT patients. The ability to make sensitive small airway measurements in these patients will allow the relationships with clinical parameters and longitudinal changes to be examined. Of subjects with VPC asthma 45% had an urgent GP visit for asthma vs 13% with WC asthma (OR 5.5 (4.4-6.9)) and 18% an ED/hospital visit compared to 7% with WC asthma (OR 3.1 (2.3-4.1)). Conclusions: Many in this cohort did not report WC asthma. 40% of nonusers of ICS (17% study population) had poor control (NWC or VPC). Guidelines suggest this group should use ICS. Poor control is associated with greater use of acute care. Background: Asthma is not controlled in some patients, despite using medium-dose ICS. Methods: Two identical Phase III, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo (pbo)-controlled, parallel-group trials (NCT01172808/821) assessed tiotropium (tio) efficacy/safety. Patients with symptomatic asthma and prebronchodilator FEV1 60-90% predicted, using medium-dose ICS (400-800 \u03bcg budesonide equivalent), were randomized to once-daily tio 5 \u03bcg or 2.5 \u03bcg (via Respimat\u00ae Soft Mist\u2122 Inhaler), salmeterol (sal, active comparator without inferential analysis) or pbo. Other LABAs were not permitted. Pre-specified co-primary end points included peak FEV1(0-3 h) and trough FEV1 response at 24 wks. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar between trials/treatment groups in 2103 randomized patients (2100 treated); mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 88.8% predicted. Both tio doses showed significant improvements vs pbo: mean change from baseline in peak FEV1(0-3 h) at 24 wks: 236 mL (tio 2.5 \u03bcg)/198 mL (tio 5 \u03bcg) greater than pbo in trial 1 (sal 213 mL); 211 mL (tio 2.5 \u03bcg) or 169 mL (tio 5 \u03bcg) greater in trial 2 (all p < 0.0001) (sal 176 mL). FEV1 trough response at 24 wks: 185 mL (tio 2.5 \u03bcg)/152 mL (tio 5 \u03bcg) greater in trial 1 (sal 123 mL); 176 mL (tio 2.5 \u03bcg)/133 mL (tio 5 \u03bcg) greater in trial 2 (all p < 0.0001) (sal 106 mL). Discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs): pbo, 2.5%; tio 2.5 \u03bcg, 1.2%; tio 5 \u03bcg, 1.9%, sal, 1.8%. No fatal events. AEs balanced across treatment groups. Conclusion: In patients with symptomatic asthma and airflow limitation despite medium-dose ICS, addition of once-daily tiotropium provides sustained bronchodilation (efficacy comparable to sal) and is well tolerated. Background: Despite current medications, there remains an unmet need for asthma control in patients with moderate asthma receiving at least ICS. We analysed ACQ data in patients treated with once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium who had symptomatic asthma despite treatment with medium-dose ICS (400-800 \u03bcg budesonide equivalent). Methods: 2103 patients were randomized in 2 identical Phase III, doubleblind, double-dummy, parallel-group studies (NCT01172808 and NCT01172821). Patients received tiotropium 2.5 \u03bcg or 5 \u03bcg or placebo (all doses via Respimat\u00ae Soft Mist\u2122 Inhaler). A salmeterol arm (active comparator) was included with no inferential analysis. Key inclusion criteria included a prebronchodilator FEV1 60-90% of predicted and ACQ score \u22651.5. A preplanned pooled analysis was performed for ACQ responder rate, a co-primary end point; responders were defined as ACQ improvement \u22650.5 at 24 weeks. Results: Baseline characteristics in patients were similar across both trials and all treatment groups. Mean baseline ACQ total score was 2.18 (SD 0.49). Both doses of tiotropium significantly improved the ACQ responder rate at 24 weeks compared with placebo (299/518 responders; 57.7%): tiotropium 2.5 \u03bcg, 332/515 (64.5%; p = 0.03); tiotropium 5 \u03bcg, 330/513 (64.3%; p = 0.03); salmeterol 356/535 (66.5%; p = 0.004). Conclusion: In patients with symptomatic asthma despite ICS therapy, the addition of once-daily tiotropium provided a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in asthma control. A similar ACQ responder rate was observed with tiotropium (2.5 \u03bcg and 5 \u03bcg) and the active comparator salmeterol.",

It is unclear whether children wheezing with HRV are more susceptible to respiratory viruses. Aim: To determine whether children presenting to hospital with a wheezing exacerbation and HRV, HRV-A or HRV-C have an increased rate of recurrent viral detections, particularly with HRV, and whether familial respiratory history plays a role. Methods: Children presenting to hospital with acute wheeze were prospectively recruited and tested for respiratory viruses. Further data on viruses detected in respiratory samples assessed longitudinally from May 1997 through to December 2012 were obtained from hospital microbiology records. This was supplemented with HRV testing on hospital respiratory samples retrieved from September 2009 to December 2012. Parental respiratory history was defined as either parent with reported asthma and/or allergic disease. Results: Children with an acute wheezing episode (n = 373, 0-16 years) had HRV detected in 69.2% of samples at recruitment and HRV-C was the most common of the HRV species (65.5%). Children with a parental history and an HRV-associated wheezing exacerbation at recruitment, had a 14-fold increased incidence rate ratio (IRR) of later HRV detection (IRR 14.0, 95%CI 1.9-104.1, p = 0.010) compared with those that did not have HRV at recruitment. Acute wheezing with HRV-A at recruitment was also associated with an increased rate of recurrent HRV detections (IRR 2.4, 95%CI 1.1-5.1, p = 0.028) in children predisposed to asthma or allergies. Conclusion: Children with an asthmatic or atopic predisposition and an HRV-related wheezing exacerbation that warranted presentation to hospital were more likely to have subsequent HRV detection in a hospital setting, and thus may be inherently more susceptible to HRV-related respiratory illnesses. Introduction: Obesity may be a risk factor for exacerbations of asthma, but the mechanisms of this effect in pregnancy are unknown. Aim: To determine the influence of maternal body mass index (BMI) on the risk of asthma exacerbations during pregnancy, and investigate the role of respiratory viral infection. Method: Women with asthma (n = 164) participated in a prospective cohort study of viral infection and asthma exacerbations during pregnancy. BMI was recorded at baseline (17 weeks gestation) and categorized as healthy weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9) or obese (>30). Exacerbations requiring medical intervention were recorded prospectively. Asthma control (ACQ7), inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), lung function and common colds were assessed at monthly visits, and additional visits were attended during colds and asthma exacerbations. Nasal and throat swabs were collected during suspected viral infections and viruses determined by PCR. Results: Women who were overweight or obese had a higher prevalence of exacerbations during pregnancy (49.5%) than healthy weight women (25%, P = 0.007). ACQ during exacerbation was higher in overweight/obese women (median 2.14) than in healthy weight women (1.69, P = 0.025). FENO during first exacerbation was a median of 13.4 (IQR 8.2, 39.2) in the healthy weight group (n = 8), 19.9 (9.5, 34.1) in the overweight group (n = 22) and 8.8 (6, 20) in the obese group (n = 27, P = 0.1083). Overweight/obese women were more likely to have exacerbations associated with PCR positive respiratory viral infections (24.7%) than healthy weight women (8.3%, P = 0.284). Excess weight gain was not associated with exacerbation risk. Conclusion: Being overweight/obese confers a greater risk of asthma exacerbation during pregnancy, and may be due to increased susceptibility to viral infection. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and determine the mechanisms involved.",

However the clinical implications of these differences using the 2011 ATS FeNO interpretation guidelines has not been described. 1 Aims: To document inter-instrument variability in FeNO measurements from 3 devices. Secondly, to investigate the implications of this variability on how test results are interpreted in an adult clinical cohort. Method: Paired FeNO measurement comparisons between NIOX MINO instruments and both Ecomedics model CLD88 (comparison A) and Sievers NOA 280i (B) systems were performed. ATS cut-point criteria of 25 ppb and 50 ppb for FeNO interpretation were applied to test results. 1 The diagnostic performance of the MINO in correctly identifying abnormal FeNO results was calculated using the Ecomedics and Sievers systems as the standard. Results are expressed as mean (SD). Results: Ninety-four adults (18 M:76 F) with MINO FeNO range of 5-98 ppb were assessed for comparison A and average difference was small at 0.2 (8.8)ppb. MINO interpretation agreement between systems was 94.7% using both cut-points. Comparison B comprised 73 adults (33 M:40 F) with MINO FeNO range of 5-131 ppb and the MINO tended to have lower FeNO values with difference of 8.8 (9.6) ppb. Interpretation agreement for this comparison was 87.7% using both cut-points. For both comparisons there was strong co-linearity across the FeNO ranges with simple linear correction (A:",

Key words: nitric oxide, FeNO, airway inflammation, asthma, eosinophils. Introduction: Respiratory viral infection (RVI), particularly by human rhinovirus (HRV), and environmental tobacco smoke exposure (ETS) are common causes of asthma exacerbation. It is essential that inhaled toxic substances associated with ETS are detoxified to minimize their potential harmful effects. The glutathione defence system is crucial in this regard. We hypothesized that variations in the glutathione genes may influence an individual's ability to detoxify pollutants leading to susceptibility to RVI, such as HRV, and subsequently to asthma exacerbation. Aim: Variants in the glutathione genes, GSTT1 and GSTM1, in combination with ETS exposure are examined to determine their effect on respiratory viral infection. Method: Children with acute asthma (n = 476, 60.3% male, age 0-16 years), presenting to Emergency Department were studied. The presence/absence of the genes were determined by PCR. ETS exposure was determined by questionnaire, which was validated by measuring urinary cotinine levels in a subset of children. RVI to 6 common respiratory pathogens was determined and HRV species were typed using molecular methods. Results: In total, 88.4% (n = 342) of the tested children had a RVI and 35.7% (n = 133) were exposed to smoke. Of these children, 26.1% and 50% were infected by HRV-A and HRV-C, respectively. Children with the GSTT1 or/and GSTM1 genes and exposed to ETS were more likely to be infected by HRV-A (OR = 2.44, 95%CI 1.14-5.23, p = 0.022; OR = 5.00, 95%CI 1.67-14.92, p = 0.004, respectively, and combined OR = 5.54, 95%CI 1.63-18.90, p = 0.006) than by HRV-C. This pattern remained consistent when examining smoke exposure by mother and father separately. Conclusion: The presence of GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes may lead to increased susceptibility to HRV-A in ETS-exposed asthmatic children.",

Aim: To compare airway wall dimensions, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell size and number, percent muscle shortening (PMS), mucus occupying ratio (MOR) and mucus gland area in cases of asthma (fatal and nonfatal) with paucigranulocytic inflammation (PG, n = 37), eosinophilic (Eos, n = 12), neutrophilic (Neu, n = 7) mixed eosinophilic and neutrophilic (Mixed, n = 18) and control subjects (Co, n = 48). Methods: On sections of airway (H&E, 5 \u03bcm) taken from post-mortem lungs, airway wall dimensions, PMS, MOR and the area densities of eosinophils and neutrophils within the inner airway wall were estimated. Cut-offs of mean eosinophil and/or neutrophil density of more/less than 5 cells/mm 2 were used to categorize cases of asthma as above. On contiguous 30 \u03bcm sections stained with haematoxylin, ASM cell size and number were determined using stereological techniques. Results: There were no significant differences in duration, age of onset of asthma or smoking history between case groups, however PG had less numbers of fatal asthma cases (p < 0.05) than other asthma groups. The reticular basement membrane thickness was significantly increased in Eos, Neu and Mixed groups compared with Co (p < 0.05). The thickness of the ASM layer was significantly increased in large airways from all asthma groups compared with Co (p < 0.05). ASM cell number per mm of airway was increased in Eos and Mixed compared with Co (p < 0.05). MOR was increased in Eos and Mixed compared with Co and PG cases. PG cases had increased gland area compared with Co (p < 0.05). These finding were similar when fatal asthma cases were analysed separately. Conclusion: ASM hyperplasia and increased luminal mucus may contribute to airway narrowing in asthma and appear to be related to eosinophilic airway inflammation.",

The extent to which remodelling of the basement membrane perimeter occurs in asthma is thought to be small but has not been quantified. Aim: To compare the Pbm from post-mortem lungs from asthma cases (n = 57) and control subjects (n = 31) from the same anatomical site within the lung. Methods: A stratified technique was used to sample the axial airways from the apical segment of the left upper lobe and the anterior and basal segments of the left lower lobe. Nine equidistant sections ('generations') of airways were taken from each lobe ranging from cartilaginous bronchi to terminal bronchioles. The Pbm (mm) was measured on cross-sections of airway stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Multiple linear regression analysis used Pbm as the dependent variable and gender, age, height, lobe, airway generation and history of asthma were included as independent variables with subject entered as a random effect. Results: Lobe was not significantly related to Pbm and was removed from subsequent analysis. The final model showed that Pbm was related to height (0.037/cm), airway generation (2.98/generation), subject (0.013) gender (-0.835 for female) (all p \u2264 0.001), and age (0.020/year, p < 0.05). The coefficient for having asthma was \u22120.49, that is, in the airways of asthma cases the Pbm would be approximately 0.5 mm shorter than similar airways in control subjects. Conclusion: Asthma is associated with remodelling of the Pbm. This could contribute to an over-estimation of wall thickness in asthma when comparing airways of similar Pbm in control cases. However the effect is small and would not account for published differences in wall area observed in cases of asthma.",

It is unclear if Gal-3 has anti-or proinflammatory roles in asthma. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of Gal-3 and Gal-3 binding protein (BP) in adults with difficult asthma, in relation to their inflammatory subtype. Methods: Participants (n = 80) with uncontrolled (ACQ > 0.7), treated asthma underwent clinical assessment and sputum induction. Sputum was dispersed using dithiotreitol and cytospin slides were prepared. Cell viability and differential cell counts were recorded. Gal-3 and Gal-3BP were measured in sputum supernatant by ELISA and assessed in sputum cells using immunocytochemistry. Eosinophilic asthma was defined as sputum eosinophils \u22653%, Neutrophilic asthma as sputum neutrophils \u226561% and Paucigranulocytic asthma as sputum eosinophils <3% and neutrophils <61%. Results: Sputum Gal-3 (median, (quartile1, quartile 3)) was significantly reduced in neutrophilic asthma (183 ng/mL (91, 287)) compared with eosinophilic (293 ng/mL (188, 471) P = 0.021) and paucigranulocytic asthma (399 ng/mL (213, 514) P = 0.004) while Gal-3BP was significantly elevated in neutrophilic asthma (103 ng/mL (74, 164)) compared with eosinophilic (53 ng/mL (17, 117) P = 0.007) and paucigranulocytic asthma (58 ng/mL (19, 158) P = 0.093). Gal-3 and Gal-3BP expression was present in airway macrophages. Gal-3BP was significantly associated with airway neutrophil, macrophage and lymphocyte proportions (r = 0.371 P < 0.001, r = 368 P < 0.001 and r = 0.254 P = 0.025, respectively). Conclusions: Increased Gal-3BP and reduced Gal-3 suggest that Gal-3 activity may be reduced in neutrophilic asthma. Loss of Gal-3 anti-inflammatory function in neutrophilic asthma may contribute to the inflammatory imbalance occurring in this asthma phenotype.",

Though phenotypic heterogeneity is increasingly recognized in asthma, it is not clear whether impaired anti-viral immunity is present in all asthmatics, or only a subset. This study examined the hypothesis that immune dysfunction in asthma varies across different inflammatory phenotypes. Methods: Innate immune responses to human rhinoviruses were examined in 85 adults with poorly controlled asthma (mean age 59 years, 63% female, mean Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-6 score = 1.7 \u00b1 0.8). Blood mononuclear cells were cultured with two strains of HRV and cytokines measured by ELISA. Inflammatory phenotypes were characterized using induced sputum as eosinophilic (sputum eosinophils >3%), neutrophilic (sputum neutrophils >61%), paucigranulocytic (sputum eosinophils <3% and sputum neutrophils <61%) and mixed granulocytic (sputum eosinophils >3% and sputum neutrophils >61%). Results: Human rhinovirus stimulated IFN\u03b1 release (n; median (q1, q3) pg/ml; P value) at 24 h was significantly lower in those with neutrophilic asthma (n = 12; 55.2 (22.4, 265)pg/ml), than in those with either eosinophilic (n = 35; 606 (281,1114)pg/ml; P < 0.01) or paucigranulocytic asthma (n = 35; 437 (212,1000) pg/ml; P < 0.01) and not different to those with mixed granulocytic asthma (n = 4; 61.4 (36.0,84.0)pg/ml; P = 0.804). HRV-stimulated IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 synthesis did not vary across asthma phenotypes. Basal (unstimulated) release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 was correlated with ACQ scores across all patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated HRV stimulated IFN\u03b1 release was independently correlated with sputum neutrophil proportion and inhaled corticosteroid dose but not age, gender, smoking status, FEV1% predicted or ACQ-6. Conclusions: In asthma anti-viral innate immune dysfunction is evident in responses from patients with neutrophilic asthma. The ability of inhaled corticosteroids to impair important innate immune responses requires further attention and study. The extent to which this predicts subsequent risk of infections and asthma exacerbations remains to be determined.",

            "text": "The altered composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the asthmatic airway may result from an imbalance in the levels of matrikines, endogenous proteases and their inhibitors. There is also uncontrolled vascular remodelling, with an increased number, size and density of blood vessels within the asthmatic airway wall. Tumstatin is a matrikine derived from collagen IV\u03b13, previously reported to be significantly reduced in the asthmatic airway tissue. Tumstatin possesses anti-angiogenic activity by interfering with the integrin signalling of endothelial cells. Aim: To investigate additional indirect angioregulatory roles of tumstatin in the asthmatic airway. Method: Primary human airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) from people without asthma were stimulated for 24 hr with 50 \u03bcg/mL recombinant human tumstatin and gene expression was assessed using a RT-PCR ECM array. The activity of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) when seeded on the ASMC-derived ECM was examined using toluidine blue staining to quantify adhesion; transwell migration through boyden chambers; and metabolic activity by MTT. Results: Following 24 hr treatment with tumstatin, ASMCs showed an increase in matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1; N = 7, P < 0.05), and MMP10 (N = 8, P < 0.05) gene expression. The ECM deposited by tumstatin-treated ASMCs induced greater adhesion of HUVECs after 30 min (N = 3, P < 0.05) and inhibited HUVEC migration after 4 hr (N = 3, P < 0.05), but had no effect on the metabolic activity of HUVECs seeded onto this matrix for 72 hr (N = 3, P > 0.05). Conclusion: Tumstatin alters the angiogenic functional patterning of the ECM via enhanced proteolytic activity with ASMCs. An alteration in tumstatin expression or activity in the airway may contribute to changes in composition and arrangement of the ECM, and increased vasculature seen in the airways of people with asthma. Funding: Asthma Foundation NSW, NH&MRC. Aim: Bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) and obesity are asthma risk factors but studies of obesity-BHR relationships have produced conflicting results. We hypothesized that the method of assessing obesity might influence such findings. Using Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) data, we examined obesity and BHR in middle-age using three obesity measures. Method: TAHS began in 1968 when 99% (n = 8,583) of all 7-year old Tasmanian school-children were enrolled. In 2010, a stratified sub-sample (n = 836) was re-surveyed by questionnaire and clinical study. A standard protocol methacholine bronchial challenge test was conducted. BHR was defined as a PD20 \u2264 2 mg methacholine. BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) assessed obesity. Logistic regression computed odds ratios for BHR, adjusting for sex, smoking, atopy, and childhood BMI. To avoid potential confounding by asthma, analysis was restricted to asthma-free participants (n = 303). For interactions with a p-value <0.1, stratum-specific estimates were computed. Results: BHR prevalence (weighted) was 9.7% (95% CI 5.1-14.4%) with no sex difference. For females, each kg/m 2 increase in BMI was associated with BHR (OR = 1.22; 95%CI 1.09-1.37, p < 0.001) but not for males (OR = 1.05; 0.90-1.21, p = 0.536). BMI > 30 kg/m 2 was associated with BHR (OR = 7.83; 1.70-36.0, p = 0.008) in females but not males (OR = 1.16; 0.21-6.26, p = 0.867). Overweight (25 < BMI < 30 kg/m 2 ) in women was weakly associated with BHR (OR = 3.82; 0.92-15.9, p = 0.066) but not associated in men (OR = 0.60; 0.12-2.87, p = 0.52). Greatly increased WC was associated with BHR in women (OR = 4.05; 1.03-15.96, p = 0.046) but not in men (OR = 2.35; 0.48-11.51, p = 0.292). WHR was not associated with BHR (OR = 1.04; 0.98-1.11, p = 0.219). Conclusion: BMI and WC were associated with BHR in non-asthmatic middle-aged women but not men. No association was found between WHR and BHR suggesting that obesity measurement could influence findings in association studies. ",

Methods: An online survey was conducted of people aged >15 with healthprofessional diagnosed asthma and symptoms or asthma treatment in the past year. The sample was weighted to the New Zealand asthma population by age, gender and region. Using the ACT, asthma control was categorized as well controlled (WC) (20-25), not well controlled (16-19) or very poorly controlled <16.

They were more likely to have discussed asthma with a health professional in the last 12 months, follow a written asthma action plan (37.0% vs 15.5%) and always use a spacer (34.1% vs 25.0%). Conclusions: Participants who felt that their asthma was well controlled despite being not well controlled according to the Asthma Control Test were prescribed more medication and more had management plans. This may suggest that health care providers have identified this asthma group and managed them according to the current guidelines.",

Introduction: The European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) is the largest international study of lung health in young and middle aged adults. Aim: To describe changes in chronic respiratory diseases and symptom prevalence in adults as they age. Methods: 876 young adults participated in ECRHS in Melbourne in 1992. Of 722 eligible surviving subjects, 550 (76.2%) completed postal or telephone screening questionnaires in 2012. 451 were invited for clinical testing including an interviewer-administered questionnaire (main questionnaire), asking about symptoms, treatment, and health service utilization for respiratory disease. 271 main questionnaires (MQs) were analysed. Results: Of the 271 subjects, 139 (51.3%) were female. The mean (SD) age was 56 (6.0) years. The most common respiratory symptoms reported were shortness of breath after exertion 114(42.1 %), wheezing 75(27.7%), nocturnal cough 80 (29.5%), chest tightness 41(15.1%), nocturnal shortness of breath 27(10.0%), daytime cough 46(17.0%), productive cough 23(8.5%), shortness of breath at rest 27(10.0%) and morning cough 23(8.5%). There were no significant differences in respiratory symptoms between sexes. Doctor diagnosed asthma was reported by 80(29.5 %); 28(10.3%) reported an attack within the last 12 months and 29(10.7%) were taking medication for asthma. Chronic bronchitis was reported by 31(11.4%), three reported emphysema and two COPD. Short acting beta agonists (SABA) were used by 45(16.6%) and combination (LABA/ steroid) inhalers by 27(10.0%). Conclusions: The cohort remains symptomatic, although most have not been diagnosed or treated. Longitudinal analysis of the complete data will be conducted to determine whether there have been changes in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms or diseases over 20 years.",

            "text": "Introduction: Fabry's Disease or Anderson-Fabry Disease is a rare X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disease. It is a result of deficiency of alpha galactosidase A, which results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide. It predominantly results in small vessel disease within the heart, kidney and nerve tissues. It is thought that globotriaosylceramide accumulates in airway smooth muscle resulting in airflow obstruction. Previous studies have shown worsening obstruction over time without treatment, and the stabilization of spirometric obstruction with enzyme replacement. Aim: To assess if there is worsening of airflow obstruction with time in patients with Fabry's Disease. To assess if there is a reduction in progression of airflow obstruction with enzyme replacement. Method: We obtained serial spirometry results for 24 patients under regular review within our institute. 19 of those patients were on enzyme replacement therapy, 5 were not. Changes in spirometry were analysed statistically. Results: There was no significant difference in FEV1 and FVC over time between the treated and untreated groups. This is likely accounted for by the small number of patients within the non treatment group. There was a significant difference in decline in FEV1 when comparing age, those below the age of 35 versus those above 35. In one case, there was improvement from severe airflow obstruction back to within normal limits with initiation of enzyme replacement. Conclusions: Within this cohort, it appears that there is worsening of airflow obstruction with age. There appears to be some reduction in the rate of obstruction progression with enzyme replacement, however this was not significant. Enzyme replacement at a younger age appears to be more effective at stabilizing airflow obstruction and in some cases can improve spirometric values.",

Aim: To describe the characteristics of severe refractory allergic asthma (SRAA) in Australia among the AXR participants. Methods: A web-based post marketing surveillance registry (www .australianxolairregister.org) was established to characterize SRAA and the use, efficacy, and adverse effects of omalizumab in the treatment of SRAA. Results: 85 participants (mean age 52 years, 39 male) with SRAA from clinics in NSW (n = 7), Victoria (n = 2) and Queensland (n = 2) were recruited. They had poor asthma control (ACQ5 score 3.4), significant quality of life impairment (AQLQ 3.8) and a prior severe exacerbation rate of 1.1/person/ year. Maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) was used by 46%. Additional maintenance medications included: immunosuppressants (3.5%), macrolides (4.7%), and antifungal agents (2.4%). Participants reported significant comorbidity. Participants with rhinitis (40%) had better baseline lung function but only 23% reported nasal steroid use. Over half (60%) of the 10 participants with nasal polyps used maintenance OCS. OCS use was more common in SRAA complicated by obesity (63% vs 38%; p = 0.028) and comorbid cardiovascular disease (76% vs 42%, p = 0.025). Depression was reported in 13 (15%) and was associated with worse asthma control (ACQ5 = 4.1). Baseline serum IgE ranged from 38 to 2916 IU/ml. 74 patients received PBS approved Xolair at a mean (SD) dose of 459(156)mg. Both ACQ and exacerbations were reduced after treatment. 22 severe adverse events recorded in 17 patients, with one (anaphylaxis) potentially related to xolair. Conclusion: People with SRAA report a high disease burden and have extensive comorbidity and medication requirements. A web based registry can be used to capture the characteristics of this population and monitor treatment responses, adverse effects, and illness burden. Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology. It is often termed an immune paradox as there is peripheral anergy with a reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity to common antigens, despite exaggerated inflammation at disease sites. The inflammation at these sites is T helper-1 (TH1) dominated, which is characterized by IFN\u03b3 production. T-bet is a transcription factor that promotes IFN\u03b3 production by adhering to the promoter region of the IFN\u03b3 gene and increasing IFN\u03b3 transcription. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underpinning the immune paradox by measuring the levels of IFN\u03b3 and T-bet in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of sarcoidosis patients. mRNA levels are poor proxies for protein levels, therefore IFN\u03b3 and T-bet protein levels were also measured in PBMCs of all subjects. Methods: PBMCs were isolated from patients with sarcoidosis and controls by Ficoll separation. Total RNA and total protein was extracted from PBMCs using TRIzol and a cell lysis buffer respectively. IFN\u03b3 and T-bet mRNA were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. IFN\u03b3 protein was measured by ELISA while T-bet was quantitated by western blotting. Results: See table. Parametric results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD while non-parametric results are presented as median (range).",

Administration of recombinant IL-13 protein to mice induces mucus production, eosinophillic inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Aim: To characterize the downstream molecular signalling pathway involved in IL-13 driven AHR as well as lung and oesophageal inflammation. Method: Mice were treated with recombinant murine IL-13 (rIL-13) after receiving Midline -1 (MID-1) targeting siRNA or nonsense control siRNA. AHR was assessed as total lung resistance and dynamic compliance in response to inhaled methacholine, expressed as percentage increase over baseline (PBS). Molecular markers of inflammation were assessed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. PP2A activity was assessed using the Active PP2A DuoSet IC activity assay. Results: Treatment with rIL-13 induced AHR and upregulation of Muc-5Ac. TRAIL and MID-1 expression was increased after rIL-13 treatment and associated with decreased PP2A activity. TRAIL and MID-1 induction was strongly attenuated in STAT6-/-mice. MID-1 siRNA treatment restored PP2A activity, attenuated AHR and inflammatory markers induced by rIL-13 in both the lung and oesophagus. Conclusion: IL-13 signals through the newly discovered TRAIL/MID-1/PP2A axis to induce AHR and inflammation. Restorating PP2A activity with MID-1 targeting siRNAs protects against IL-13 driven pathogenesis in the lung and oesophagus. Murine AB1-FGF-9 knockdown cells (or controls) were injected (5 \u00d7 10 5 cells) subcutaneously into the flank of Balb/c mice. Tumour dimensions were measured thrice weekly and animals sacrificed when tumours reached 100 mm 2 . AB1-FGF-9 knockdown tumour growth was significantly retarded (0.25 \u00b1 0.25 mm 2 ) compared to parent (79 \u00b1 15 mm 2 ) and vector (100 \u00b1 0 mm 2 ). To examine immune system involvement in the regulation of MM tumour growth, cells were grown in nude mice. AB1-FGF-9 knockdown tumours (94 \u00b1 6 mm 2 ) grew at a similar rate to parent (117 \u00b1 5 mm 2 ) and vector (112 \u00b1 8 mm 2 ) which suggests a role of T cells in MM tumour regulation in the absence of FGF-9. To further explore this, T cells were depleted in Balb/c tumour bearing mice using specific antibodies. AB1-FGF-9 knockdown tumours were significantly larger in mice depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells in isolation (CD4-; 38 \u00b1 7 mm 2 , CD8-; 77 \u00b1 12 mm 2 ) or in combination (62 \u00b1 10 mm 2 ) compared to non-depleted controls (17 \u00b1 10 mm 2 ) which suggests a T cell-mediated response. Orthotopic model: Balb/c mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 \u00d7 10 5 AB1-FGF-9 knock-down cells (or controls). At day 13, animals were sacrificed and the number of peritoneal tumour nodules enumerated by blinded investigators.

Background: Hypernatraemia, which is often associated with abnormalities in fluid or sodium balance, is associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. However hyperosmolarity, a secondary effect of hypernatraemia, is lung protective in both cell culture and animal models. Induced hypernatraemia (leading to hyperosmolarity) has not been studied in lung injury. Aim: To investigate whether hypertonic saline is protective in an intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced lung injury rat model. Methods: Immediately following induction of acute lung injury male Sprague Dawley rats received either hypertonic 20% saline (i.v.) or resuscitation fluids at dosages designed to control for either or both sodium or water load (0.9% saline, 4% albumin, 20 % albumin or 5% dextrose). Following 2 hours of non-injurious mechanical ventilation blood gases, lung oedema, respiratory mechanics and histological lung injury score were assessed. Results were analysed with 2-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc analysis. Results: Administration of hypertonic saline resulted in hypernatraemia (serum [Na+] 168 mmol/l and 162 mmol/l) by 30 min, maintained to 2 hours, after initiation of lung injury. Administration of hypertonic saline was associated with reduced lung injury evident as decreased lung oedema (p < 0.001), myeloperoxidase activity (p < 0.0001), bronchoalveolar lavage cell (p < 0.0001), protein (p < 0.001), TNF-\u03b1 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p < 0.001) and lung histology injury score compared with positive fluid control animals. Similarly, lung physiology was improved with higher PaO2 (p < 0.0001) and lower lung elastance (p < 0.0001), which was associated with preservation of surfactant activity as assessed by small to large aggregate ratio of surfactant phospholipids (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Hypernatraemia is lung protective in LPS induced acute lung injury, independent of fluid or sodium load. Introduction: People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have impaired antiviral interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 responses to influenza infection. The mechanisms underlying the reduced IFN-\u03b2 induction in COPD however are unknown. Antiviral stress granule (AvSG) and IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome formation is important in the induction of IFN-\u03b2 production. Aim: We hypothesize that the formations of AvSG and IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome are impaired in COPD primary bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs) to influenza infection, leading to reduced IFN-\u03b2 induction and enhanced viral replication. Methods: pBECs from healthy non-smoking volunteers and subjects with COPD were infected with human influenza A/H1N1 at MOI of 5. AvSG proteins PKR, TIAR, G3BP were detected by immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy, and by western blotting. IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome proteins pIRF3, pATF2, and p300 were also measured. IFN-\u03b2 protein was measured by western blotting. Viral replication was measured by plaque assay. PKR was silenced by specific siRNA 24 before infection. Co-localization test was performed using ImageJ according to instructions. Results: Influenza infection resulted in reduced AvSG component PKR, TIAR, and G3BP expression and decreased formation of AvSG in COPD pBECs. The formation of IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome was also significantly decreased in COPD pBECs with reduced expression of enhanceosome components pIRF3, pATF2, and p300. We then determined that PKR was important in the formation of AvSG, as PKR inhibition by siRNA led to impaired AvSG formation and also IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome. This then led to reduced IFN-\u03b2 induction and increased influenza viral replication in COPD pBECs. Conclusion: COPD pBECs have impaired formation of AvSGs and IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome to influenza infection. This was the result of reduced PKR protein expression, leading to reduced IFN-\u03b2 protein production and increased viral titre. Aim: Portable oxygen concentrators (POC) are lighter and easier to manoeuvre than portable oxygen cylinders, however their ability to meet the oxygen requirements of people with interstitial lung disease (ILD) during exercise has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of ambulatory oxygen delivered during exercise using the EverGo POC to ambulatory oxygen delivered with a portable cylinder in people with ILD. Methods: People with ILD who desaturated to less than 90% during a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) on room air were recruited. Following two practice tests, participants undertook a 6MWT using a portable oxygen cylinder and a 6MWT using the EverGo POC, in random order. The Evergo POC delivered pulsed flow on its maximum setting of 6, whilst the portable cylinder was set on 5 L/minute with continuous flow. Participants pulled their own oxygen devices which were matched for weight. The primary outcome was nadir SpO2 during the 6MWT. Results: Participants were 7 people with ILD (6 IPF, mean age 68(SD 6) years, TLCO 50 (13) Mean duration onset of symptom to diagnosis was \u223c6.5 months (SD5.48). Anti GM-CSF antibody was detected in all 6 cases that were tested. All complained of exertional dyspnoea. Cough, fatigue, weight loss and chest tightness were present in 58%, 33%, 25% and 17% of cases, respectively. Intercurrent infection was seen in 3 patients. 36 single whole lung lavages (WLL) were performed in 11 cases. One anaesthetist performed the majority of these procedures. 1 patient had trialled GM-CSF and Rituximab, while another had GM-CSF trial. Conclusion: PAP is a rare disease underlining the importance of a dedicated team managing these patients. WLL is currently the gold standard treatment and is safe and effective. Toxic particle inhalation may be more frequently associated with PAP in this group. Aim: Skeletal muscle weakness is a common feature of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and correlates strongly with reduced exercise tolerance. Given the potential impact of skeletal muscle function on exercise tolerance, skeletal muscle strength is an important component of assessment in patients with ILD.",

Method: Consecutive patients attending Royal Prince Alfred Hospital ILD clinic (Sept 2010-Jan 2013) with results for serum precipitins were analysed. Diagnoses from multidisciplinary review were recorded. Clinical data, including HP antigen exposure, and serum precipitins were collected by an investigator blinded to the ILD diagnosis. Results for budgerigar (Ge90), pigeon (Ge91) (Jul 2011-Jan 2013) and farmer's lung (GMX7) (Jan 2012-Jan 2013) specific IgG measured on the ImmunoCAP250 (Phadia\u2122), and FSK4 (pigeon, budgerigar and poultry) and FSK3 (farmer's lung) serum precipitins identified using immunoprecipitation (Sept 2010-Dec 2011) were analysed. Results: 144 ILD patients (mean age 63 \u00b1 13 yrs; 74 male) had serum precipitins analysis. Diagnoses included: idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (n = 48); connective tissue disease related ILD (n = 45); HP (n = 24); sarcoidosis (n = 10), other ILD (n = 14) and non-ILD (n = 3). Mean FVC was 77.5 \u00b1 22.4% and DLco was 53.7 \u00b1 20.5%. A relationship between positive serum precipitins and HP diagnosis was demonstrated (OR 2.58; 95%CI 1.03, 6.48; p = 0.04). ROC curve analysis revealed optimal threshold levels of 20.7, 11.0 and 12.5 mg/L to pigeon, budgerigar and farmer's lung antigens respectively, with sensitivities of 42.9, 35.7, 50% and specificities of 78.5, 87.2, 73.1% respectively. ROC analysis within the exposed study population determined optimal threshold levels of 34.2, 11 and 12.5 mg/L to pigeon, budgerigar and farmer's lung antigens respectively, with improved sensitivities of 80, 80, 66.7% and specificities of 100, 84.6, 77.8% respectively. Conclusion: Serum precipitins are predictive of HP diagnosis, although limited by poor sensitivity within unstratified ILD patients. Their diagnostic value is improved in exposed individuals with suspected ILD.",

Aim: To describe the prevalence of VitD deficiency in our ILD cohort, and the relationship between VitD levels and osteopenia on bone density scan. Method: Consecutive patients referred to the RPAH ILD clinic (Mar 2011-Nov 2012) were consented for serum storage (n = 79, 45 male; mean age 64 \u00b1 13 yrs). Serum was analysed for 25-OH VitD levels using the Liaison immunoassay. All patients also had concurrent pulmonary function and 54 had bone density scans within 28 months. VitD insufficiency was defined as 30-60 nmol/L, and VitD deficiency as <30 nmol/L. Results: ILD diagnoses included CTD-ILD (n = 22) and granulomatous disease (n = 19), idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP, n = 30) and other ILD (n = 5). 25 (32%) were using VitD supplements, 39 (49%) corticosteroids, and 8 (10%) bisphosphonates. Mean FVC was 78 \u00b1 23%; DLco was 52 \u00b1 21%, 25-OH VitD levels were 62.5 \u00b1 21.7 nmol/L. 33 (42%) were VitD insufficient and 6 (8%) were VitD deficient. VitD insufficiency was not associated with underlying ILD diagnosis. VitD levels were higher in those taking Vit D supplements, and were weakly negatively correlated with lung function: TLC% (R = \u22120.23, p = 0.04); DLco% (R = \u22120.29, p = 0.01). 28 (52%) had osteopenia, and 8 (15%) had osteoporosis. Aim: Several clinical and case studies show that short-term treatment with anti-fungal medication improved the clinical status of the disease. To further explore this, a study was undertaken where treated patients were followed till healing of the disease. Method: Newly diagnosed cases of sarcoidosis were given corticosteroids (n = 21) or anti-fungal medication (n = 20). Seven patients were given both drugs in view of the severity of their disease. The patients were followed with x-ray, determining the degree of granuloma infiltration and chitotriosidase (CTO) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in serum. The time till clinical healing of the disease was recorded as well as the number of recurrences. Results: The time till healing was 11.9 months for those with anti-fungal treatment and 13.7 months for corticosteroid (NS) . Regarding x-ray scores, there was no difference between the groups at diagnosis. At six months after initiation of treatment and at healing, the granulomatous infiltration was significantly less severe among those with anti-fungal medication (p = 0.025 and 0.003 respectively). The number of recurrences was also lower in the antifungal group (1 vs 7, p = 0.006). Conclusion: There were no differences in the studied parameters, comparing treatment with corticosteroid and anti-fungal medication. The presence of subjects with more severe disease, who were given both medications, suggests that the efficiency of anti-fungal treatment may be limited to the less severe forms of the disease. It may also reflect the cautionary attitude of the clinician administering the medication. Background: In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), exercise oxygen desaturation is associated with poorer outcomes independent of disease severity. The role of supplemental oxygen in patients without resting hypoxia is not clear.",

Methods: IPF subjects displaying oxygen desaturation at 6MWT but without resting hypoxia were studied. Subjects performed two cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) using stationary cycle ergometry, randomized to 60% oxygen or medical air in a cross-over double-blinded fashion. Subjects also completed two endurance shuttle walk tests (ESWT) randomized to 3 L/min oxygen or medical air in a cross-over double-blinded fashion. We studied the difference between endurance distance and other variables between oxygen and medical air using Student's paired t-test. Results: Six subjects (mean age 64.5 \u00b1 6.0 yrs; five males) were studied, with mean FVC 79.5 \u00b1 19.5%, DLco 46.2 \u00b1 10.2%, resting SpO2 95.2 \u00b1 2.5% and 6MWT nadir SpO2 83.9 \u00b1 3.8%.

Introduction: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC's) are rapidly becoming a great source of information on disease processes as well as showing a potential in exerting therapeutic effects in cardiac disease models. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and fatal disease caused by abnormal cellular signalling in the pulmonary vasculature. Despite a new era of therapeutics, survival is still poor. Thus, there is a need to further understand the pathogenesis of this disease as well as develop more effective therapies. Aim: To culture EPC's from whole blood taken from both the pulmonary artery (PA) and left ventricle (LV), characterize these cells and perform functional analysis to compare the disease state with health controls. Methods: Right heart catheterization was performed on a PAH subject, during which 8 mL of blood is taken from the PA and another 8 mL from the LV. Immediately following, mononuclear cells are isolated, washed and seeded in a gelatine (Sigma) coated well. Cells are cultured in endothelial medium (EGM-2MV Lonza) for 6 weeks and characterized using flow cytomtery. Results: Outgrowth cells were observed at 4 weeks in the LV sample only and were cultured to 6 weeks. LV cells were observed to proliferate rapidly from 4-6 weeks, displaying endothelial like morphology of rounded cells with a cobblestone appearance. Flow cytometric analysis characterized the cells as: vonWillibrand factor + , CD144 + , CD146 + , CD31 + , VEGFR2 + , CD133 -, CD14and CD45 dim . Conclusion: This pilot study has identified a highly proliferative endothelial progenitor cell population, displaying mature vascular endothelial cellular markers that may be restricted to the downstream side of the pulmonary vascular bed. These cells have the potential to provide functional information on the pathogenesis of PAH in human subjects, as well as be potentially useful as a surrogate for in situ endothelial cells to evaluate therapeutic gene delivery approaches for PAH.",

Recurrent hospital admissions with dyspnoea had been attributed to acute pulmonary oedema and congestive cardiac failure, treated with diuretics and increasing home oxygen (FiO2 40%). Transthoracic echocardiograms (Echo) over one year identified rapidly progressive severe pulmonary hypertension (RVSP 85 mmHg) with associated significant right ventricular dilatation with reduced systolic function and severe tricuspid regurgitation, from a normal baseline. Pulmonary function tests showed preserved spirometry and lung volumes, but progressively declining gas transfer (DLCO/Va) to 1.42 L (31% predicted). CT pulmonary angiogram showed upper lobe emphysema, lower lobe fibrosis, and no evidence of pulmonary embolus. Right heart catheterization revealed at least moderate pulmonary hypertension (mPAP 39 mmHg). Other causes of pulmonary hypertension were excluded, with negative autoimmune serology, normal Echo bubble study, and normal nuclear medicine shunt study. The patient was commenced on oral sildenafil 20 mg thrice daily, nebulized iloprost 5 micrograms six times daily and warfarin, in addition high flow oxygen (FiO2 40%) and increased diuresis with frusemide 80 mg daily and spironolactone 12.5 mg daily. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) on discharge was 60 metres. Results: Initial stabilization of function was noted, with symptomatic and clinical improvement. At three months 6MWD increased to 90 metres, however one year after commencing treatment 6MWD declined to 40 metres. Aim: To prospectively evaluate the impact of specialist respiratory physiotherapy on health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and/or chronic cough and increased sputum production. Method: Patients attended two outpatient sessions of 45-60 min, 4-6 weeks apart for individualized physiotherapy assessment and education of airway clearance techniques (ACT), exercise, and use of adjunctive inhalation therapies by a senior cardiorespiratory physiotherapist. The focus was on developing an effective, practical and sustainable independent programme. Healthrelated QOL was measured using the Leicester Cough questionnaire (LCQ) and COPD assessment tool (CAT) prior to and after the physiotherapy consultations. Patient rated VAS scales measuring education outcomes and perceived efficacy of the sessions was also collected. Results: 22 patients (16 females); mean age 69.4 \u00b1 10.5 years, BMI 29 \u00b1 6, FEV1 1.54 \u00b1 0.5 l/min, and FEV1% predicted 62.8 \u00b1 15.7. Ten patients (46%) established a home routine using independent breathing techniques and 12 (54%) used adjunct oscillating positive expiratory pressure devices. All patients were prescribed a home exercise programme, eight (36%) attended pulmonary rehabilitation, and eight commenced saline nebulization as an adjunct to ACT. Following the two-session intervention significant improvement in coughrelated health status (mean difference 2.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.5, p < 0.01), all LCQ health-related domains [physical, psychological and social] (p \u2264 0.014) and total CAT scores (mean difference 3.5, 95% CI 0.4 to 6.5). Patients reported increased understanding of bronchiectasis (p < 0.05) and rated the physiotherapy intervention as helpful to their overall management (VAS mean 94 \u00b1 9). Conclusions: This two-session physiotherapy intervention with a specialized respiratory physiotherapist improved health-related QOL in patients with primarily non-CF bronchiectasis and appears to be a clinically cost effective programme. Further study is required to determine if specialist outpatient physiotherapy interventions may improve other hospital cost utilization including reducing hospital admissions. ",

Potential therapies for this disease have thus far failed to translate the success from pre-clinical murine models to clinical settings. Aim: We sought to improve on limitations associated with existing small animal models of fibrosis in using a more physiologically relevant species using a lung segmental model to investigate pulmonary fibrosis in sheep. Methods: Two separate lung segments in eight sheep received two challenges two weeks apart of either 3 U bleomycin (BLM)(1 \u00d7 BLM) and 30 U (10 \u00d7 BLM) in the lung and a third segment received saline as a control. Lung function in these segments was assessed for changes in resistance. BAL samples and lung tissue were used to assess for inflammation, fibrosis and collagen content two weeks after the final dose. Results: Instillation of both 1 \u00d7 BLM and 10 \u00d7 BLM resulted in prominent fibrosis (pathology scores: 1 \u00d7 BLM: 11 and 10 \u00d7 BLM: 11.75 vs. saline: 0.75, p < 0.0001, n = 8) and collagen deposition in the isolated lung segments of sheep, not observed in controls. Compared with 10 \u00d7 BLM dosing, 1 \u00d7 BLM dosed segments reduced inflammatory cells in BAL. Prominent alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) hyperplasia was observed in both these lobes, but a more heterogeneous pattern and less significant loss of alveolar airspace volume of fibrosis was observed in 1 \u00d7 BLM segments (1 \u00d7 BLM 48 \u00b1 2.4% vs. 10 \u00d7 BLM 34 \u00b1 3.5%, p = 0.01, n = 8).

Such patients may develop to acute exacerbations and may require non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Little is known about the distress experienced by these patients, including symptom burden and delirium point prevalence. To date, no studies have quantified symptom burden in this group. Aim: To describe symptom burden and delirium point prevalence in patients requiring NIV. Methods: Consecutive consenting, English speaking, cognitively intact patients treated outside ICU with NIV for hypercapnic respiratory failure at a Sydney teaching hospital were recruited. Assessment occurred within 36 hours of starting NIV. Symptom burden over the previous 72 hours was assessed measured using the Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (CMSAS). This scale assessed the peak bothersomeness of 11 physical symptoms (rated 0-4) and frequency of 3 psychological symptoms (rated 0-4) Delirium point prevalence was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU). Results: Fifty participants were recruited. Participants had a mean pH of 7.30 (SD 0.08) and a mean pCO2 of 58.1 mmHg (SD 11.9). Thirty-eight percent had obstructive lung disease, 14% had heart failure, 30% had both these conditions. The remainder had other causes of respiratory failure. The most prevalent symptoms were breathlessness (92%), dry mouth (88%) and lack of energy (86%). These were also the most bothersome symptoms. The most frequent psychological symptom was worry (64%). The mean total CMSAS was 1.60 (SD 0.66), with the mean physical symptom score of 1.62 (SD 0.63) and the mean psychological score of 1.57 (SD1.22). Four (8%) screened positive for delirium on the CAM-ICU. Conclusions: Breathlessness, dry mouth and lack of energy are highly prevalent and bothersome. The point prevalence of delirium was 8%. This may be an underestimate. These findings highlight the high symptom burden experienced by this population. A greater understanding of this burden could help address the needs of patients requiring NIV.",

Benefits include decreased dyspnoea, improved health-related quality of life (QOL) and decreased health-care utilization. Studies have shown that overall completion rates of PR are poor (30-50%) and impacted by complex health issues. The aim of this study was to review clinical data and 12-month hospitalization rates of patients who had completed the Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service (GCHHS) PR programme versus those who attended less than 80% of sessions. Methods: A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive patients enrolled into the GCHHS PR programme. Hard-copy and electronic medical records were reviewed. Unpaired t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare those who completed and those who failed to complete PR. Paired t-tests and paired Wilcoxon tests were used to compare baseline to post-PR data for those who completed PR and also those who attended less than 80%. Results: Sufficient data were available for 63 patients (50 completed PR and 13 failed to complete PR). There were no significant differences between the two groups in number of hospitalizations within 12 months following PR. There was a significant improvement in St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and 6-minute walk distance from baseline in those who completed PR (p < 0.001 for both) but no significant improvement in SGRQ in those who did not complete PR (p = 0.055). Conclusion: These GCHHS PR programme outcomes match published data suggesting QOL and functional exercise capacity significantly improves with rehabilitation. We did not find a reduction in hospital admissions post rehabilitation. A limitation of the study was the lack of a comparative cohort that did not commence PR.",

            "text": "Introduction: TSANZ guidelines state that supplemental O2 therapy is contraindicated in current smokers. Blood COHb is elevated in smokers and used to screen patients for smoking. Here, we discuss a patient with chronic haemolytic anaemia whose supplemental O2 prescription was delayed due to persistently elevated COHb levels after smoking cessation. Case Description: A patient with severe COPD (ABG: PaO2 54 mmHg, PaCO2 52 mmHg, pH 7.41, bicarbonate 32 mmol/L) and right heart failure stopped smoking in order to qualify for supplemental O2 therapy. His COHb level prior to smoking cessation was 12.2% and 6.5-8.4% post cessation (N < 2.0% in non smokers). The patient denied continued smoking. After 2 measurements of elevated COHb over a 2 week period, increased endogenous COHb production due to his chronic haemolytic anaemia secondary to pyruvate kinase deficiency was considered to be the likely cause of the raised COHb. The patient was prescribed supplemental O2. His COHb fell to 5.5% and his exercise tolerance and right heart failure improved. Such improvements may have resulted in part from supplemental O2 reducing the capacity for endogenous carbon monoxide to bind to haemoglobin. Discussion: COHb is produced endogenously in excess in haemolysis as it is a break-down product of red blood cells. It is raised in haemolytic anaemia, haematoma breakdown and massive transfusion. Other causes of modest increase in COHb include certain drugs, severe COPD and pregnancy. In this case, prescription of supplemental O2 was delayed due to suspicion of smoking from elevated COHb. We recommend that other screening tests such as measurement of Cotinine, a break-down product of nicotine, be used to assist in cases where COHb is raised and smoking status is uncertain. The importance of elevated COHb to O2 transport will be discussed.",

We previously reported our ICU-based NIV service treated fewer patients, had increased intubation rates, and resulted in longer hospital length of stay (LOS) compared to a ward-based service at another institution. Accordingly we implemented a ward-based NIV service. Aim: To compare our transition from an ICU to a ward-model of care. Methods: Prospective single-centre observational study of patients admitted with AECOPD, acute respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.35, PaCO2 > 45 mmHg) and treated with NIV. In the first phase, NIV delivered exclusively in the ICU setting. Subsequently NIV delivered in the ward-setting, but targeted a milder group of AECOPD patients (pH 7.25-7.35, single organ involvement). Patient demographics, survival, intubation rates, LOS and physiological parameters were recorded. Results: 16 cases were treated in the ICU-based service over 16-months and 32 in the ward-based service over 12-months. There was no significant difference in patient demographics and clinical outcomes of mortality [0(0%) vs 3(9%); p = 0.54], intubation [2(25%) vs 0(0%), p = 0.11] or change in ABG indices. However the ward-based service treated more patients per month (1 vs 2.75, p < 0.01) and had shorter LOS (13.4 days 95% CI, 9.3-17.5 vs 8.6 days 95% CI 6.2-10.9, p = 0.03), with a trend towards greater number of days receiving NIV (2 days 95% CI 1.6-3.3, vs 4.2 days 95% CI, 2.9-5.5, p = 0.07) and more total hours of NIV received (16.1 hours 95% CI 6.6-25.7 vs 29.6 hours 95% CI 18.4-40.7; p = 0.12). Conclusion: Transition to a ward-based NIV service enabled us to treat more patients and resulted in shorter LOS, whilst clinical outcomes were non-inferior to an ICU-based delivery model.",

            "text": "Aim: To explore patterns of time use in people with COPD and their spouses. Background: Distinct activities, independent of energy expenditure, can influence health in different ways (i.e. reading and watching TV impact eating behaviours and cognitive loads differently). Use of time recalls allow construction of detailed daily activity profiles, offering unique insights into time use choices. Symbiotic relationships are common in couples where one member has a chronic disease. This is particularly evident in people with COPD where avoidance of dyspnoea inducing activities may lead to spouse reliance. Data detailing how people with COPD and their spouses cohabitate are lacking. Methods: 19 people with COPD and their spouses (COPD Age 74.4 \u00b1 8.4 yrs. FEV1 58% \u00b1 24%, Spouses Age 69.0 \u00b1 11.6 yrs., FEV1 106% \u00b1 20%), recalled four separate 24 hour time use profiles using the Multimedia Activity Recall in Children and Adults (MARCA). Using structured interviews, the MARCA systematically records individual activities, durations and where appropriate, intensities between anchor points (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Over 500 discrete activities are embedded in the adult MARCA. Contextually similar activities are collapsible into one of ten superdomains (sports/exercise, screen time, transport, quiet time, self-care, cultural, work/ study, chores, social and sleep). Deviations from predicted superdomain durations (min/day) were obtained by averaging the four time use profiles from each participant and regressing superdomain durations (min/day) against age according to sex. Differences in superdomain durations between spousal members were assessed using paired t tests. Results: People with COPD devoted more time to superdomains where low energy expenditure activities were prevalent (screen time and quiet time) than their spouses, while spouses spent more time engaging in activities contained in the superdomains chores and social. . Four statistical methods were used to establish the MID of 6MWT distance: one anchor-based and three distribution-based methods. Results: Analysis using an anchor-based method did not fulfil the requirement of having a correlation coefficient above 0.5 between the anchors of health related questionnaires and the 6MWD. Therefore, this analysis was terminated. An analysis based on Cohen's estimate resulted in a MID of 28 metres (0.5\u00d7SD of change pre-post PR in 6MWT distance). Applying the empirical rule of effect of \u223c8% of the range of 6WMD scores (Sloan et al.) gave a MID of 31 metres. Lastly, we compared pre and post PR change scores of the SGRQ and CRQ changes with the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) of the 6MWT (SEM defined as SD\u221a1-r, with baseline SD of 6MWT distances; 19 metres (95%CI 17-22)). Comparing the CRQ and SGRQ change scores that were established, 90.9% (CRQ) and 66.7% (SGRQ) of patients exceeded the MID, compared to 54% for the 6MWT proposed as the average threshold for MID of 28 metres. Conclusion: These analyses conducted in respiratory patients with a wide severity range suggest that a MID for change in 6MWT of 35 metres as previously suggested may be higher than required when evaluating PR outcomes. Aim: To identify participant and environmental factors that may have influenced the outcome of a step test used as a screening tool for subject recruitment into a multi-centre randomized cross-over trial. Method: Patients with stable COPD under supplemental oxygen therapy were considered for inclusion into a multi-centre randomized cross-over study comparing battery powered portable oxygen concentrators to portable cylinders (one month each). A step test was used as a screening tool to ensure that recruited subjects would have a benefit with supplemental oxygen therapy when administered either supplemental oxygen via cylinders or portable concentrators. Comparative analyses were used to investigate participant and environmental factors (including gender, age, Charleston co-morbidity index, step height and season) that may influence the outcome of the screening step test recruitment criteria. Results: Thirty-five subjects out of n = 106 screened (33%) qualified for oxygen according to the criteria of the step test. Of those participants who passed 46% were female, mean age was 72.54 \u00b1 9.06 years, mean Charleston Co-Morbidity Index was 1.68 \u00b1 1.63 and age adjusted index was 4.65 \u00b1 2.12. For participants who failed to pass the step test 35% were female, mean age was 72.06 \u00b1 8.14 years, mean Charleston index was 1.74 \u00b1 1.05 and age adjusted index was 4.55 \u00b1 1.54. Subjects who passed the step test were more likely to have a test performed in Spring (63%) compared to those who failed to pass (46%). Seventy-four per cent of subjects who passed the step test had the greater step height of 16 cm, compared to 57% of subjects who failed to pass (lower step height is 10 cm); however, none of these factors produced statistically significant differences between groups. Conclusion: None of these demographic or environmental factors produced a statistically significant effect on the step test screening outcome. Patients prescribed oxygen supplementation need to be regularly reassessed to ensure they still require oxygen therapy. Key words: oxygen, concentrator, cylinder, COPD, portable, step test, qualify.

This programme aims to improve self-efficacy, which may be advantageous given the high prevalence of anxiety and depression in COPD. The effects of anxiety and depression on CDSM are largely unknown, as are the effects of CDSM on healthcare utilization. Aim: To investigate the impact of anxiety and depression on hospital admissions in participants undergoing CDSM. Methods: Retrospective, exploratory analysis of a multicentre randomized controlled trial of PR vs CDSM (PRSM). 169 participants (mean age 68 years, mean FEV1 52% pred, 73 female) attended PR (8 weeks, 16 sessions; n = 85) or CDSM (6 weeks, 6 sessions; n = 84). Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) scores and self-reported hospital admissions were recorded after 3, 6 and 9 months. Data were analysed via generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: Across both groups, participants with high anxiety scores (\u226510) had a tendency towards more hospital days than others (p = 0.082), whilst anxiety 'responders' (reduction \u22651.5 points) had more frequent hospitalizations (beta = 0.09, SE 0.05; p = 0.043). Within the CDSM group, high anxiety was associated with more hospital days (beta = 2.77, SE = 1.01; p = 0.006) but not a significantly greater need for hospitalization (p = 0.056) or more frequent hospitalizations (p = 0.197). High levels of depression did not affect any outcomes relating to hospital admissions. The effect of CDSM on hospitalizations did not differ between anxiety or depression 'responders' and 'non-responders'. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the Stanford CDSM programme on hospital admissions in people with COPD appears to be influenced by high levels of anxiety but not depression.",

There is a lack of research within Australia on the prevalence and impact of cognitive impairment in COPD. Aim: To assess the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and to assess the impact of this on pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) outcomes. Method: A prospective cross sectional study of COPD patients referred to PR was conducted. Patients were screened for cognitive impairment using the MMSE. Six minute walk test, inhaler device technique, Bristol COPD knowledge questionnaire, self-management scenarios and the St George Respiratory Questionnaire were administered pre and post PR. Results: 29 patients with COPD were recruited. The mean (SD) age was 69.4 (8.8) years and 15 (52%) were male. Mean (SD) baseline FEV1 was 52.27% (19.72).

Conclusion: In this population the majority of patient referred to PR had normal cognition according to the MMSE, almost 1/3 showed only mild impairment. This may reflect clinician selection bias for pulmonary rehabilitation referral. Mild impairment did not impact on their ability to complete PR. Further work is required to assess the effect of more severe cognitive impairment on pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes.",

Repeat testing is recommended during stable disease, however its necessity during an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is unclear. This study investigated the repeatability of the 6MWT during AECOPD. Methods: 17 participants (7 male, mean age 69 years, FEV1 42% pred) who presented to hospital with AECOPD and sputum expectoration were recruited. Two 6MWTs (T1, T2) were performed in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines at hospital discharge. Distance walked (6MWD) at T1 and T2 were compared via Bland-Altman plots. Exploratory comparisons between 'responders' (T2 -T1 \u2265 30 m) and 'non-responders' were performed via unpaired t-tests. Results: Mean 6MWD difference was \u22124.9 m but limits of agreement were wide (\u2212114 to 104 m). Compared to 'non-responders', 'responders' (n = 6) had a significantly lower smoking history 22.1 (14) vs 75.5 (48) years, p = 0.02; shorter length of stay 2.7 (0.7) vs 7.0 (4.6) days, p = 0.04; and a trend towards more rests 1.7 (1) vs 0.6 (0.9), p = 0.052. Conclusion: There is marked variability between two 6MWDs on the same day at the end of a hospital admission for COPD exacerbation. A single 6MWD may not be a reliable measure of functional exercise tolerance immediately following a COPD exacerbation. Aim: To examine the relationship between the in vivo airway response to DI and the structure of the ASM layer. Methods: Subjects (control, asthma or COPD) due to have lung resection surgery completed a questionnaire on respiratory health, had allergy skin tests and had their response to DI assessed before and after bronchodilator inhalation. Response to DI was determined from the ratio of expiratory flow measured after maximal expiration (M) and partial expiration (P) from a submaximal lung volume (i.e. M/P ratio). Post-operative tissue was fixed for structural assessment of the area of ASM, numerical density and mean volume of ASM cells, and estimation of the volume fractions (VV) of ASM, ECM and 'Other' within the ASM layer. Results: M/P ratios were typically <1 in the asthmatic and COPD groups indicating bronchoconstriction following a DI. When all subjects were combined, the pre-bronchodilator M/P ratio positively correlated with the FEV1/FVC ratio and was inversely related to age, but not to subject height or weight. Pre-bronchodilator M/P ratio was positively correlated with the number of ASM cells per volume (favouring reduced bronchoconstriction after DI) but not with mean ASM cell volume or VVASM, VVECM or VVOther. There was no relationship with post-bronchodilator M/P ratios for subject characteristics, lung function or ASM layer parameters. Conclusion: The airway response to DI is related to the volume density of ASM cells before, but not after bronchodilator. Findings suggest that the established relationship between response to DI and ASM structure is determined by contractile rather than passive properties of ASM. Aim: There is little evidence to guide: whether repeat PRP is helpful; the ideal interval between PRP repeats; the indications to repeat; the sub-population that benefits most from PRP repeat. We sought to characterize the patient population that has repeated the PRP in our centre, and to assess outcomes after repetition of PRP. Method: A retrospective review (12 years) of patients with CLD who participated in the PRP on more than one occasion was undertaken to assess outcomes over repeated PRP (increase in 6 minute walk distance [6MWD] and FEV1). Data presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Results: 872 patients completed PRP between September 2001 to September 2013, of whom 140 (16%) had completed PRP more than once. 109 completed twice (PRP2), 23 completed three times (PRP3), 7 completed four times (PRP4), and 1 completed six times (PRP6). The change in 6MWD after PRP1 was 59 m (413 \u00b1 88 m to 472 \u00b1 104 m, p < 0.0001), and this diminished after PRP2 to 31 m (from 374 \u00b1 109 m to 414 \u00b1 112 m, p < 0.0001), and after PRP3 was 26 m (374 \u00b1 101 m to 400 \u00b1 103 m, p < 0.003). The FEV1 was 1.03 \u00b1 0.44 L pre PRP1, 0.92 \u00b1 0.4 L pre PRP2, and 0.84 \u00b1 0.38 L pre PRP3. Conclusion: Patients with CLD who repeated PRP at least twice tended to have worse lung function at the time of repeat, but still had significant gains in 6MWD with repeat PRP, although the increase in 6MWD appeared to diminish with repeat PRP. We speculate that the reason for the decreased improvement in 6MWD over time may relate to worsening lung mechanics.",

Patients with severe COPD have high and often complicated end-of-life needs that are currently not being met by health services. The transition and timing for referral of COPD patients to palliative care services has not been straightforward as prognostication is notoriously difficult. Aim: To investigate the attitudes and opinions of patients with COPD regarding specialist palliative services. Method: Patients with a diagnosis of COPD requiring an admission for non-invasive ventilation were invited to participate in the study. All patients had very severe COPD many with chronic respiratory failure Interviews were conducted focusing on understanding of health, planning for future care and end-of-life issues. Inductive analysis was used to draw out three key themes. Results: Patients with severe COPD did not perceive a role for their General Practitioner in their acute care. Psychologically and emotional support was expected to be provided by acute services. Those with end-stage disease had a connection with secondary care and many wanted to die in hospital surrounded by health professionals they trust. The interviewees did not see the relevance of specialist palliative care services. There was no easy-to-identify entry point into these services or the need to plan for an exit point. As no clear entry point into secondary respiratory services was identifiable, so was there no need to plan for an exit point. Conclusion: Specialist palliative care services are charged with extending services to those with chronic illness however the palliative services developed for cancer patients don't seem to serve COPD patients with a long illness trajectory. We demonstrated a mismatch between perceptions of those leading health systems and those of people living with conditions such as COPD.",

However it is procedure with some risks particularly local injury to artery or nerves, haematoma formation, infection and not to mention adequate knowledge and skill required to obtain a sample. Aims: This study aimed to assess whether venous blood gas(VBG) evaluation can reliably predict ABG levels in patients admitted with AECOPD. This in turn would effectively prevent arterial puncture trauma and related complications. Material and Methods: In this prospective observational study we included 36 patients who presented to Gold Coast Hospital emergency department and were admitted under Respiratory unit with symptoms of AECOPD. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. All underwent ABG and VBG within 24 hours of admission. All patients were treated similarly in terms of AECOPD. Results: 34 patients were enrolled in the study comprising of 16 males (47%) and 18 females (53%). Median age was 70.6 (range 57-89) years. The correlation coefficient between ABG and VBG were: pH (0.699, p < 0.001), pO2 (0.356, p = 0.039), pCO2 (0.683, p < 0.001), HCO3 (0.961, p < 0.001) and base excess (BE) (0.979, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that there is indeed a correlation between ABG and VBG parameters (very strong: HCO3 and BE, moderate: pH and pCO2 and weak: pO2). This suggests that VBG may have clinical utility in the respiratory failure management of AECOPD patients. A limitation of our study is the small sample size and ongoing study will allow us to validate our findings in a larger cohort.",

As the hygiene hypothesis only explains some of these differences, we propose the novel hypothesis that epigenetics, of which DNA methylation is a key component, may have a profound effect by controlling gene expression and thereby cellular phenotype. Aim: To assess the role of CD14 methylation in determining the differences in the levels of IgE as a surrogate for the high allergy disparity observed in the genetically similar Karelian population east and west of the Finnish-Russian border. Methods: Total serum IgE levels were measured using a radioallergosorbent test (UniCAP 1000 v.2). Methylation levels of the 3 CpG sites in the promoter of CD14 gene were determined in 250 Finnish and 250 Russian Karelian children. Bisulfite-treated DNA samples were amplified and subsequently pyrosequenced. CpG site 2 is located at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site (rs2569191: CD14 -1145CT) that is in linkage with a functionally important SNP (rs2569190: CD14 -159/-260 CT). Results: Methylation levels of sites 2 and 3 of the promoter were higher in Finnish Karelian children (59.0% and 92.7%, respectively) compared to Russian children (57.7%, p = 0.006; and 90.1%, p < 0.001, respectively). Methylation levels at all 3 promoter sites correlated with total serum IgE levels only in Russian children ( Introduction: Intrapulmonary airways and arteries are an important therapeutic target in many lung diseases. Endothelin-1 (Et-1) is a potent constrictor of smooth muscle implicated in lung diseases such as asthma and pulmonary hypertension. The lung slice technique allows direct observation of intrapulmonary airway and artery reactivity in situ, and whilst airway reactivity has been extensively characterized, assessment of vascular pharmacology within lung slices is relatively limited. Aims: Our aim was to compare Et-1 reactivity between intrapulmonary airways and arteries in rat intrapulmonary airways. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g) were used for preparation of lung slices. Briefly, heparin (500 IU in HBSS/HEPES) was injected into the right ventricle, followed by agarose (2% in HBSS/HEPES) into the trachea via cannula, and the lungs bathed in cool HBSS/HEPES before slices (150 \u03bcm thickness) were cut using a vibratome. After overnight incubation at 37 o C, changes in airway and artery areas within slices were imaged using phasecontrast microscopy during perfusion with Et-1 \u00b1 antagonists (ETA/Bbosentan, ETA -BQ123, ETB -BQ788), or dilator agents. Results: Rat intrapulmonary airways (\u223c200-300 \u03bcm diameter) and arteries (100-200 \u03bcm) contracted to a similar level in response to Et-1, with pEC50 values of 7.9 \u00b1 0.4 and 7.7 \u00b1 0.2, respectively. Bosentan (10 \u03bcM) significantly antagonized Et-1-induced contraction in both airways and arteries, with contraction mediated via ETB > ETA receptors. The \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol relaxed intrapulmonary airways but not arteries, and the novel dilator rosiglitazone was able to elicit both airway and artery relaxation.",

Aim: The aim of this study was to identify the local barriers to optimum asthma control in our community. Method: Adult patients(n = 50) with asthma admitted to ED, inpatient ward and those in outpatient clinics participated in a structured questionnaire assessing demographic profile, asthma severity, medications, exacerbating factors, socioeconomic factors, asthma education and WAP usage.

Psychological issues were common (70%).While 70% felt their asthma was well controlled the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ5) demonstrated only 30% were well controlled. All could afford the cost of their medications, inhaler technique was correct in over 90%. The median (range) of presentations to the ED last year was 2. Asthma health literacy was poor in 80%; only 30% had a WAP. Most (70%) did not follow their WAP for a variety of reasons and 57% were not confident using it. Physician limitations to use of WAP included lack of time and difficulty in obtaining an action plan easily. Conclusion: The major drivers of poor asthma control identified in our population include poor asthma education coupled with the low uptake and adherence to a WAP. Measures to improve asthma education and self-management skills in addition to increased support and treatment of psychological issues need to be explored. Introduction: In recent years, the incidence of asthma in developed countries has increased markedly. Of particular relevance, epidemiological studies show an inverse correlation between asthma incidence and chronic infection with the gastric bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Aim: We aimed to assess whether H. pylori infection would attenuate an asthmatic phenotype in a mouse model of allergic airways disease. Method: We infected adult female C57BL/6 mice (n = 10 per treatment) with 10 9 cfu of a proprietary strain of live Helicobacter pylori via gavage. The live H. pylori used was fully active and capable of colonizing the gastric mucosa in mice. Control mice were gavaged with saline. Eight weeks after infection, mice were subjected to a standard systemic ovalbumin sensitization protocol. This was followed by five daily ovalbumin aerosol challenges for infected mice and the positive control group. The negative control group received five daily saline aerosols. Twenty four hours after the last aerosol, we assessed responsiveness to methacholine (MCh) via the forced oscillation technique and cellular inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage. Results: Infection was confirmed via bacterial culture. Airway resistance at the maximum dose of MCh was not significantly different between H. pylori infected mice and negative control mice. Both groups had significantly lower airway resistance at the maximum dose of MCh compared to positive controls, (positive control = 1.55 \u00b1 0.45 cm.H2O.s.mL \u22121 , H. pylori infected mice = 1.11 \u00b1 0.21 cm.H2O.s.mL \u22121 , negative control = 0.97 \u00b1 0.18 cm.H2O.s.mL \u22121 ). Infected mice had significantly fewer eosinophils and significantly more lymphocytes (p < 0.05 in both cases) in their lavage compared to positive controls. Conclusion: Infection with live H. pylori significantly attenuated an ovalbumin induced allergic airways disease phenotype in adult mice. Our finding supports the notion that exposure to microbial antigens live H. pylori can contribute to normal immune system development and function. Introduction: Mouse models show that prolonged transforming growth factor alpha (TGF\u03b1) expression promotes chronic lung disease particularly in early growth response-1 (Egr-1) deficient mice. Notably, airway smooth muscle (ASM) is thickened and the exaggerated increase in lung resistance following bronchoconstrictor challenge supports a role in airway disease. Aim: We aimed to determine the effect of short-term TGF\u03b1 expression on ASM thickening and the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Method: TGF\u03b1 was conditionally expressed in the airway epithelium of transgenic mice (Clara cell secretory protein-rtTA(+/\u2212)/[tetO](7)-TGF\u03b1(+/\u2212)) following 10 d exposure to doxycycline in chow. Egr-1 deficient mice on doxycycline (n = 5) were compared with a control group (n = 4) that were wild type for Egr-1 and did not receive doxycycline. Airway and lung mechanics were assessed by the forced oscillation technique and lungs fixed for subsequent airway morphometry. Results: ASM thickening was detected in TGF\u03b1 transgenic Egr-1 deficient mice (P < 0.05) following doxycycline treatment for 10 d. AHR was also demonstrated, defined by an exaggerated increase in Newtonian resistance after methacholine challenge (P < 0.05) compared with controls. In comparison, there was no effect on lung elastance or tissue damping before or after methacholine. Conclusion: Doxycycline induced-TGF\u03b1 expression in Egr-1 deficient mice, after 10 d, produces ASM remodelling and AHR with no change in parenchymal mechanics. Short-term TGF\u03b1 expression in airway epithelial cells promotes features characteristic of asthma. Grant Support: NHMRC (1027218, 1045824), NIH (HL097135).",

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that inflammation in asthmatic and nonasthmatic endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) may be mediated by different types of inflammasomes. Method: Inflammasome-related proteins in sinus biopsies of patients having asthmatic (n = 12) and non-asthmatic CRSwNP (n = 7) (CRSwNPA+ and CRSwNPA-, respectively), and non-inflammatory controls (n = 6), were studied for mRNA expression in whole tissue extracts by RT-PCR, and for protein expression and localization in epithelium of paraffin sections by immunofluorescence. Comparisons between PCR expression values were done using the comparative delta Ct method and significance was tested using Student's t-test. Results: Compared to controls increased mRNA expression (P < 0.001) was detected for AIM2 (3.8 and 3.9 folds), NLRP3 (3.1 and 2.9 folds), and IL-1beta (3.5 and 2.8 folds) in CRSwNPA+ and CRSwNPA-, respectively. At the protein level and within the epithelium, change in NLRP3 expression was not statistically significant. AIM2 protein expression in CRSwNPA+ was increased compared to both controls and CRSwNPA-(\u223c50%, P = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively). Notably, a nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of AIM2 and its concentration near the apex was found specific for epithelium of CRSwNPA+ patients. Activation of caspase-1 was detected at the epithelial apical surface of both CRSwNP endotypes but not controls.",

Aim: To determine the spectrum of planned and urgent health care professional (HCP) interactions over a year in Australians with current asthma. Methods: Members of a large panel were invited to participate in an online survey. The cohort selected was representative of the national population with current asthma aged 15+ by age, gender and State. In analysis, reweighting was applied to ensure that the individual datasets were representative. Within the previous year, the frequencies of planned and urgent General Practitioner (GP) visits, Emergency Department (ED) attendances, hospital visits and discussions with a pharmacist about asthma were recorded. Results: 9388 respondents with ever-diagnosed asthma were identified: after stratification, 3033 subjects with current asthma were selected of whom 2686 completed the survey. 76.3% of the cohort had had an interaction with one or more HCP in the period. The rates of attendance for the weighted population in the period by type of HCP are reported.",

We have found that 59.4% of children presenting to hospital with acute wheeze had human rhinovirus (HRV) group C and that children with HRV-C had increased; exacerbation severity, number of hospital admissions and severity of atopy by skin prick test and IgE, compared to no HRV-C. What is unclear is whether children with acute wheezing illnesses are more susceptible to HRV-C. Aim: To determine the persistence and recurrence of HRV species in children presenting to hospital with acute wheeze and controls over a 12-week period spanning winter. Methods: Cases (n = 20) were recruited on presentation to hospital with an acute wheezing illness and controls (n = 23) from the community. Flocked nasal swabs were collected at Day 1 and every two weeks by study parents. Viral RNA was extracted from nasal aspirates and reverse transcribed. A two-step PCR of the HRV 5\u2032 non-coding region was sequenced for typing. Statistical analyses were completed using SPSS v22. Results: Children were mostly female (cases 8/20 = 40% and controls 12/23 = 47.8%) with a mean age of 5.9 years (cases) compared with 5.1 (controls, p = 0.522) and were followed for a mean 66.4 days, range = 1-86. Between cases and controls there was no difference in the persistence (mean = 13.2 vs 15.7, respectively, p = 0.147) or the rate of recurrence (median = 70.0 days vs 84.0, respectively, p = 0.714). There was no difference in the persistence of HRV-C (mean = 13.6 days, SD = 2.2, p = 0.424) compared with HRV-A (mean = 15.0, SD = 4.1). However, HRV-C and HRV-B recurred more often (n = 16/30) and in fewer days (median = 56 days, 95%CI = 39.8-72.2, p < 0.001) than others (n = 2/31, median = 77). Conclusion: HRV-C recurs faster than HRV-A and thus may be either more pathogenic and/or induces less host protection.",

Aim: To develop a rapid-throughput method for assessing proportional antimicrobial susceptibility of whole CF sputum to identify antibiotic combinations most likely to be effective in mixed pseudomonal infections. Methods: MacConkey broth containing single and combination antibiotics at clinical EUCAST breakpoint concentrations was inoculated with homogenized sputum from pseudomonas-colonized CF patients. Method development involved measurement of antibiotic susceptibility by two methods: inhibition of bacterial growth by optical density measurement at 600 nm (OD600), and inhibition of bacterial metabolic activity using Resazurin. Both assessments were spectrophotometric, and performed in a 48-well plate format. Results: OD600 measurements in 2 sputum samples were highly reproducible, whether measured in samples overall (ICC 0.92, p < 0.001), or as intrasample (CoV 0% to 36%, median 8.5%; CC 0.9-0.98, p < 0.0001) and intersample (CoV 0 to 26%, median 19%; CC 0.95, p < 0.0001) duplicates. In contrast, the third sample was poorly reproducible. However, every result identified the same antibiotic combinations as the 'best' choice (tobramycin/ meropenem for patients 1 and 2, and tobramycin/ceftazadime for patient 3). Metabolic activity measurements were less reproducible overall (ICC 0.71, p = 0.09), and for intersample duplicates (CoV 0-39%, median 11%, CC 0.90, p = 0.01) but good for intrasample triplicates (CoV 0-39%, median 3%, CC's 0.89-0.97, p < 0.001), however this method also identified 'best' antibiotic combinations reliably, although had lower discriminatory power than OD600 measurements for antibiotics with high antimicrobial efficacy. The 2 methods appeared comparable (CC 0.9 for means, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: PST performed in a high throughput format is feasible and in this preliminary evaluation appears to have satisfactory reproducibility by both methods. Even where numeric reproducibility was suboptimal, all samples identified the same best antibiotic combinations, implying utility as a clinical tool. Conclusions: High flow oxygen is used in ambulances and the ED for COPD exacerbations, only 53% being recognized as having COPD and 37% having clinically significant hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 90%). A FiO2 > 0.28 is most often initiated during ambulance transfers and continued in the ED. A larger study would be required to assess any possible harm of this approach, but education of those involved in emergency care may reduce the risk of the complications of hypercapnia in COPD exacerbations. We performed a pilot study to implement the pathway for titrating inspired oxygen to the target saturation of 88-92%. Aim: The aims of the pathway were timely diagnosis of acute respiratory failure (ARF: arterial pH < 7.35 and pCO2 > 45 mmHg), prevention of ARF associated with hyperoxia, and minimization of arterial blood gas (ABG) samples.",

ABGs were recommended for oxygen saturation <88%, or if venous pH < 7.35 or pCO2 > 45 mmHg at presentation. Results: At presentation, oxygen saturation was at or above target while breathing air in 5 patients, <87% on air or oxygen in 8, and above target on supplemental O2 in 11. Inspired O2 was adjusted appropriately in 17 and inappropriately in 7 patients. After 1 hour 16 patients reached target oxygen saturation, and 8 patients exceeded target saturation on supplemental oxygen. AVF was diagnosed by ABGs at presentation in 3 patients.

Aim: Exposure to asbestos can lead to the development of lung cancer and it has been estimated that approximately 2-3% of all male lung cancer deaths are due to asbestos. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of occupational and non-occupational exposures to asbestos between those with lung cancer and a control group. Methods: Structured telephone interviews were conducted with adult subjects who have had lung surgery for either lung cancer (LC group) or other clinical conditions (control group). The interview questionnaire was designed to survey lifetime occupational and residential asbestos history, 'do it yourself' (DIY) home renovation activities and other possible environmental exposures. Results: Interviews were conducted in 75 participants (36 LC, 39 controls) with 51% being males (n = 38). There was no significant difference in the incidence of occupational or non-occupational exposure to asbestos between the groups (Table 1) .

For at least 7 years of his boatbuilding career he was heavily exposed to aluminium dust. CT chest showed bilateral patchy parenchymal infiltrates with a crazy-paving appearance, and calcified mediastinal lymph nodes. Physical examination was unremarkable, but spirometry showed restriction. His sixminute walk distance was 345 m, and he desaturated to 85% after four minutes' walking. Broncho-alveolar lavage returned a milk-white lipoproteinaceous fluid which stained positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Electron microscopy showed lamellar bodies in macrophages and in the fluid itself, suggestive of alveolar proteinosis. The diagnosis was confirmed after GM-CSF antibodies were identified on the lavage fluid. Mediastinal lymph node biopsy revealed high levels of aluminium and aluminium oxide on scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. He underwent periodic whole lung lavages as indicated by lung function testing and symptoms. After two years he left the boatbuilding industry, following which his symptoms improved. Discussion: Alveolar proteinosis is a rare lung disease characterized by the diffuse accumulation of PAS-positive lipoproteinaceous fluid in the alveoli. Symptoms are non-specific, but restrictive change in lung function is typical. Autoimmune (90%) and non-autoimmune (10%) forms of alveolar proteinosis have been described, with the latter encompassing congenital and secondary causes. Silicate inhalation and haematological malignancy are the commonest secondary causes. Only one case linking aluminium to alveolar proteinosis has so far been reported, but metallurgical analysis of tissue in this patient supports the conclusion that aluminium was the cause of his disease. Background: Fungi is a risk factor for some respiratory diseases. Traditional exposure measurements are time consuming and do not take into account the total fungal cell biomass. Analysis of the enzyme \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) has been used as a measure of total fungal biomass. Aims: To assess the usefulness of the NAHAs technique to detect fungal damage and to perform measurements in homes of patients with asthma and sarcoidosis. Methods: Air samples were taken using a filter cassette. An enzyme substrate was added and the fluorescence was read after incubation. The fluorescent readings were expressed as NAHA units (U/m 3 ). Samples were taken in buildings which were later inspected for fungal damage (n = 162). Measurements were also made in the bedrooms of subjects with asthma (n = 80) and sarcoidosis (n = 88). Results: At levels above 30 U/m 3, in buildings there was a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 100% for the presence of fungi. NAHA was higher than controls in homes of persons with nocturnal asthma (31.2 vs 12.5 U/m 3 , p = 0.001). Among . patients with sarcoidosis, the values were higher compared to controls (34.1 vs 18.9 U/m 3, p = 0.002). Those with recurrent sarcoidosis had higher values than those where the disease had healed (39.9 vs 12.0, p = 0.001. There was significant relationship between NAHA and the extent of granulomatous infiltration and the amount of \u03b2-glucan in BAL.",

Introduction: Performing a bronchoscopy is commonly used for investigating patients with possible pulmonary TB when spontaneous sputum is smear negative. Currently there is no evidence that BAL is superior to BW in sputum smear negative pulmonary TB. General consensus varies between clinicians. Aim: To determine if performing a BAL yields a higher diagnostic rate compared to BW alone in pulmonary TB. Method: In a prospective study of subjects (n = 50) with possible active pulmonary tuberculosis, the diagnostic yield of BAL was compared to BW. Subjects either produced no sputum or had (acid fast) smear negative sputum. BAL and BW were performed on all the patients. The order of BAL and BW was randomized.

Background and Aim: The aim for this experiment is to assess the level of expression of ppar\u03b3 in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis subjects as compared to healthy controls. Ppar\u03b3 is an anti-inflammatory nuclear receptor gene expressed widely in the lung. Low levels of airway PPAR\u03b3 is associated with an increased likelihood of P. aeruginosa positivity in the cystic fibrosis lung. It is postulated that the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing molecule 3-oxo-C12homoserine lactone antagonizes ppar\u03b3, inhibiting its transcription. Methods: Forty one non-CF bronchiectasis subjects and 20 healthy controls underwent fibreoptic bronchoscopy sampling for the collection of lavage fluid. Messenger RNA was extracted from the samples and reverse transcribed to total cDNA using random hexamer primers. Expression of the gene encoding PPAR\u03b3 was measured using real time PCR, with levels normalized to beta actin gene expression. Results: Ppar\u03b3 expression was lower in non-CF bronchiectasis subjects compared with controls (p = 0.0001), and lower in those patients who were PCR positive for P. aeruginosa (p = 0.012). There was an inverse correlation with P. aeruginosa load (rs \u22120.531, p = 0.002), which was not seen with either total bacterial load (rs 0.239 p = 0.194) or Haemophilus influenzae load (rs 0.297, p = 0.325). Ppar\u03b3 expression was positively correlated with absolute macrophage count (rs 0.377, p = 0.044), consistent with the inverse correlation of P. aeruginosa with total macrophage level (rs \u22120.403 p = 0.025). Conclusion: Ppar\u03b3 expression in the airways of non-CF bronchiectasis subjects is significantly reduced compared to healthy individuals. This reduction is correlated with lower levels of macrophages (a cell type where the PPAR\u03b3 gene is highly expressed) and increased levels of P. aeruginosa. Whether the reduction in ppar\u03b3 is purely a reflection of low macrophage levels or a due to its interaction with P. aeruginosa warrants further study. Introduction: Neutrophils are important in controlling infections, in particular respiratory virus infections. During these times there are increases in neutrophil numbers and products. Neutrophillic inflammation is associated with more severe asthma symptoms and corticosteroid insensitivity. Their role in viral-induced asthma exacerbations or if neutrophils directly respond to respiratory viruses is not fully understood. Aim: To investigate if neutrophils are activated by viral surrogates (TLR agonists) and different infectious respiratory viruses. To identify whether asthmatic and non-asthmatic neutrophils respond differently to viral surrogates. Method: Peripheral blood samples were collected from mild asthmatic (n = 9-11) and non-asthmatic individuals (n = 13-18). Neutrophils were stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml), FMLP (100 nM), imiquimod (3 \u03bcg/ml), R848 (1.5 \u03bcg/ ml), poly I:C (10 \u03bcg/ml), rhinovirus (RV)-16 (MOI 1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (MOI 1) or influenza virus (MOI 1). Cell free supernatant was collected after 1 h for measurement of neutrophil elastase (NE) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 release or after 24 h for interleukin (IL)-8 release.",

            "text": "Results: LPS, FMLP, imiquimod and R848 stimulated the release of IL-8, NE and MMP-9. However, poly I:C induced only IL-8 release. There was no difference between asthmatic and non-asthmatic neutrophil responses, except for R848 in which neutrophils from asthmatic patients released significantly more IL-8 than control patients (p < 0.01). RSV caused the release of IL-8 and NE but not MMP-9 in neutrophils. However, RV-16 and influenza virus did not cause the release of any of the three mediators measured. Conclusion: Neutrophils can detect and respond to viral surrogates by releasing IL-8, NE and MMP-9. However, neutrophils do not mount a response to RV-16 or influenza virus but they do detect and respond to RSV. Some respiratory viruses may not induce neutrophillic inflammation directly but this form of inflammation may be a result of neutrophil interactions with adjacent infected cells. Background: Obesity is associated with a reduction in FRC which may contribute to increased airway closure during tidal breathing and abnormalities in ventilation distribution. Aim: To determine distribution of airway closure measured as non-ventilated volume (NVV) in obesity before and after bronchoconstriction. Methods: 9 obese and 10 non-obese healthy subjects underwent baseline and post-bronchoprovocation SPECT ventilation scans on separate days. Total lung volume and NVV were calculated from matched CT and SPECT lung scans using a previously described algorithm. For analysis, all lungs were divided into upper, middle and lower thirds of equal lung height. Results: Baseline NVV was similar in the obese and non-obese groups. NVV in each lung third as a proportion of total NVV (NVVprop) was less in the upper third and greater in the middle third in obese compared to non-obese subjects (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004 respectively), but similar in the lower third. Both groups experienced a similar fall in FEV1 after bronchoprovocation. Overall closure (total NVV) increased similarly in both groups following bronchoprovocation. In obese, NVVprop was similar in all thirds compared to baseline, so the increase in airway closure was spread evenly across all thirds.",

VO2-RM has been studied using external dead space (DS) to reflexly increase ventilation in resting subjects. We sought to validate the novel measurement of VO2-RM using DS with steady state exercise, and to compare the repeatability of VO2-RM between control conditions of rest and exercise. Method: This single blind randomized study included replicate visits which examined (1) rest and (2) constant cycle exercise at 50 W, for conditions of: (a) control, (b) a volume of DS targeting ventilation of 45 L/min during exercise, and (c) a volume of DS targeting ventilation of 65 L/min during exercise. A separate visit examined maximal incremental cycle exercise. Ventilation was analysed with off-line correction for flow alinearity. VO2-RM was determined from the linear slope of the increase in VO2 (mLs) per increase in ventilation (L/min) using linear mixed modelling. Limits of agreement were determined from comparison of replicate linear regression slopes from individual visits. Results: 10 healthy male subjects of age 27.5(SE 1.8 years and BMI 22.6(0.5 had VO2-RM 3.10(0.27 mL/L/min with exercise and 2.53(0.40 mL/L/ min with rest (NS). VO2-RM at DS-65 was 4.6(0.7 % of the total VO2 at matched ventilation during incremental exercise. Limits of agreement for VO2-RM were 0.30(bias error) +\u22125.27(random error = 1.96*SD) mL/L/min for rest and 0.79 +\u2212 4.04 mL/L/min for exercise (NS). Conclusion: Observed VO2-RM was similar to other studies of resting VO2-RM, and was an expected proportion of total VO2 during incremental cycle exercise. VO2-RM is able to be validly measured with DS during steady state exercise. Repeatability of VO2-RM within an individual is poor for both rest and exercise, which may limit potential for future clinical use of the current technique. Introduction: Many COPD patients have limited exercise tolerance. We wanted to assess potential predictors of symptoms and six minute walk distance (6MWD). Dynamic hyperinflation (DH) has been shown to limit exercise tolerance in COPD. EFL is a major determinant of COPD and can be measured non-invasively with forced oscillation technique (FOT). EFL may increase DH and symptoms resulting in exercise limitation. Aims: We hypothesized that EFL causes increased dyspnoea and reduced 6MWD. Methods: 6 COPD subjects without cardiac failure or orthopaedic comorbidity affecting exercise capacity were recruited from RNSH Pulmonary Rehabilitation department. Spirometry, lung volumes and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) were obtained prior to 60 seconds tidal breathing FOT measurements at 5 Hz followed by three deep inspirations. Subjects subsequently performed a 6MWT. Borg score of dyspnoea severity was measured every 28 m, and expressed as the slope of Borg vs distance walked (Borg slope). The relationship between EFL, 6MWD and Borg slope were assessed by Spearman's correlation.",

Only 21% (12/56) of patients had PE despite being labelled with a high pre-test probability.Conclusion: Despite evidence and a specific algorithm at FMC for EA in high risk patients, EA remains underused. However, EA may be associated with an increased bleeding risk in this cohort.

Depressed T-bet expression levels in PBMC of sarcoidosis patients may help explain part of the phenomenon of peripheral anergy associated with sarcoidosis. Conflict of Interest: No.IL-27 MRNA AND PROTIEN EXPRESSION IN THE PERIPHERAL BLOOD OF SARCOIDOSIS PATIENTSIntroduction: Sarcoidosis is a systemic non-caseating granulomatous disease characterized by peripheral anergy to common recall antigens but exaggerated CD4 + TH1 responses at sites of disease. This local disease is largely mediated by cytokines which play a crucial role in initiating and perpetuating inflammation. IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine structurally related to IL-12 and has been shown to direct na\u00efve CD4 + T-cells into the TH1 subset by inducing IL12\u00dfR. IL-12 then acts on IL12\u00dfR to produce IFN\u03b3, the canonical TH1 cytokine. Recently, IL-27 has been increasingly considered as an attenuator of inflammatory responses, repressing cytokine production from activated T lymphocytes. This study aimed to investigate the expression of IL-27 mRNA and protein in PBMCs and plasma of sarcoidosis patients. Methods: PBMCs were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs of sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls using TRIzol and IL-27 mRNA expression measured using quantitative real-time PCR with HPRT as a reference control. Plasma IL-27 protein was measured by ELISA in 100 \u03bcl aliquots in sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls. Results: See table. Results are presented as median (range).Conclusion:The inconsistency between the IL-27 mRNA and protein expression levels in sarcoidosis could be due to the short in vivo half-life of IL-27. Nevertheless, increased expression of IL-27 mRNA in PBMCs of patients compared to healthy controls suggests that IL-27 may have a role in the sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis and may be implicated in sarcoidassociated peripheral anergy.Conflict of Interest: No.Background: Bronchiectasis is prevalent in Northern Territory children (1 in every 68 Indigenous children) and occurs very early in life. Poor or inadequate treatment leads to loss of lung function and subsequent reduction in lifeexpectancy. The disease is associated with ongoing infection, colonization of the lower airway with NTHi and neutrophilic inflammation. We hypothesized that a reduced macrophage host response to infection may contribute to the development of bronchiectasis. We investigated the ability of alveolar macrophages (AM) to phagocytose NTHi. As we have previously found defective AM clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) in other chronic lung diseases that may contribute to tissue damage and ongoing inflammation, we also assessed efferocytosis and expression of scavenger receptors involved in phagocytosis/efferocytosis. Methods: 8 controls (mean age 7.8 months) and 35 children with bronchiectasis (mean age 43.5 months) were recruited. Efferocytosis, phagocytosis of NTHi, and expression of mannose receptor, colec12 and scavenger receptor A were assessed by flow cytometry. Results: A small but significant decrease in the ability of AM to phagocytose either NTHi or apoptotic cells was found in children with bronchiectasis vs control children (NTHi 19% vs 15%; apoptotic cells 20% vs 15%). Reduced expression of MR and SRA was noted in the bronchiectasis group vs controls. There were no significant correlations between % phagocytosis/efferocytosis and age, blood or BAL neutrophilia, CRP, or Indigenous status among children with bronchiectasis. Conclusions: Ineffective clearance of NTHi or apoptotic cells in children with bronchiectasis may contribute to colonization of the lower airway with NTHi, chronic inflammation and progressive lung damage.",

Many mediators including prostaglandin (PG) D2 promote asthma, while PGE2 is a major endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator and bronchodilator. Both PGE2 & PGD2 act via multiple receptors, namely, EP1-4 & DP1-2, respectively. We hypothesized that airway inflammation-associated miRNAs target EP and DP receptors in airway epithelial cells. Aim: To determine whether specific microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate EP and DP receptor expression. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis identified miRNAs linked to asthma and inflammation with potential to target 3\u2032UTR sites on EP and DP receptors. We assessed the regulation of these miRNAs with proinflammatory stimuli. Using transfection studies we validated EP and DP targets in A549 and 16HBE cells. miRNA and EP receptor mRNA expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR. Results: PGD2, PGE2 and IL-1\u03b2 modulated the expression of EP and DP receptors as well as the expression of miRNAs predicted to target EP/DP receptors. We identified inverse correlation between EP2 and miR-100, -155 & -200 c; DP1 and miR-499a; and EP3 and miR-16, -21, -126 & miR-223. Additionally, we validated miRNA and EP/DP receptor relationships. Conclusions: Several miRNAs were identified that likely play a role in the rapid regulation of EP and DP in human airway epithelium. This provides us a better insight of the molecular mechanisms involved in PGE2 and PGD2 regulation and possible future management of severe airway inflammation.LUNG CANCER IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED EXPRESSION OF PERFORIN, GRANZYME B AND IFNG BY INFILTRATING T CELLS, NKT-LIKE AND NK CELLS Lung Research, Hanson Institute and Department of Thoracic Medicine, Royal Adelaide Hospital, 2 Department of Medicine, University of Adelaide, 3 Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, University of Tabuk, Saudi ArabiaBackground: Cytotoxic CD8+T cells mount immune responses to cancer via pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic pathways including IFN\u03b3 and perforin/ granzyme B. We have previously shown reduced granzyme B expression by CD8+ T cells in lung cancer tissue resected from lung cancer patients. We hypothesized that lung cancer may also be associated with deficiency of perforin and IFN\u03b3 by T cells and other lymphocyte subsets including NKT-like and NK cells. Methods: Lung cancer and normal tissue was identified by experienced pathologists and tissue disaggregated into single cells. Following adherence and removal of macrophages, intracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines and expression of the cytotoxic mediators granzyme B and perforin were measured in CD4 and CD8+ T, NKT-like cells and NK cells by flow cytometry. Results: There was a significant increase in the percentage of CD3+ T cells in cancer tissue (Ca: 92 \u00b1 14 and N: 71 \u00b1 14 (mean \u00b1 SD) p < 0.05) and a decrease in the percentage of T, NKT-like subsets and NK cells expressing perforin and IFN\u03b3 compared with normal tissue (Ca: 0.4 \u00b1 0.6, 8 \u00b1 7, 6 \u00b1 5 and N: 22 \u00b1 8, 36 \u00b1 23, 93 \u00b1 39 perforin+ T, NKT-like and NK cells). There was also a decrease in the percentage of CD8+ T cells and CD8+ NKT-like cells expressing granzyme B compared with normal tissue (Ca: 6 \u00b1 5 and N: 30 \u00b1 15 CD8+NKT-like GB+ cells). Conclusions: Lung cancer is associated with decreased expression of perforin, granzyme B and IFN\u03b3 by infiltrating T cells, NKT-like and NK cells that may be an important immune evasion mechanism.Introduction: Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (IPAH) is a fatal disease characterized by pulmonary microvascular remodelling. Recent studies show that PAH is associated with reduced BMPR2 and increased TGF-\u00df, and can be ameliorated by BMPR2 gene delivery. Aims and Objectives: To investigate the impact of BMPR2 gene delivery on TGF-\u00df signalling. Methods: BMPR2 was delivered to human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMC, Passage 4) using Adenovirus vector expressing human BMPR2, then cells were stimulated with TGF-\u00df and downstream signalling assessed with western blots and quantitative RT PCR. Results: BMPR2 upregulation led to a decrease in several TGF-\u00df-induced upregulation effects, including phosphorylation of Smad2, AKT, Erk 1/2 and Shc. BMPR2 reversed the TGF-\u00df-induced decrease in Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation. TGF-\u00df-induced upregulation of hNOX4 mRNA was also reduced. NOX4 has been identified as a factor mediating hypoxia induced proliferation of PASMC. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the PAH-modulating effect of BMPR2 gene delivery is in part related to downregulation of 'pro-proliferative' TGF-\u00df signalling.

We describe a novel approach to improve adherence, retention and clinical review rates of Indigenous children. Methods: This descriptive study was nested within a placebo-controlled, randomized trial (RCT) on weekly azithromycin (or placebo) for 3-weeks. Indigenous children aged \u226424 months hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis were recruited from two tertiary hospitals (Darwin and Townsville). Using mobile phones embedded within a culturally-sensitive approach and framework, we report our strategies used and results obtained. Our main outcome measure was rates of adherence to medications, retention in the RCT and self-presentation (with child) to clinic for a clinical review on day-21. Results: Of 301 eligible children, 76 (21%) families declined participation and 39 (10%) did not have access to a mobile phone. 186 Indigenous children were randomized and received their supervised medication dose one in hospital. Subsequently, 182 (99%) children received dose two (day-7), 169 (93%) dose three (day-14) and 180 (97%) attended their clinical review (day-21). A median of 2 calls (IQR 1-3) were needed to verify adherence. Importantly, over 97% of children remained in the RCT until their clinical endpoint at day-21. Conclusions: In our setting, the use of mobile phones within an Indigenousappropriate framework has been an effective strategy to support a RCT in urban and remote Australia. Further research is required to explore other applications of this approach, including the impact on clinical outcomes. Trial Registration: ACTRN12608000150347 (RCT component).

Aim: The aim of our study was to assess the degree of asbestos exposure in a cohort of 110 age and gender matched peritoneal and pleural mesothelioma patients. Method: Detailed historical data of the patients' exposure were provided for each patient as assessed by lawyers involved in the care of the patients. Based on this, exposure was categorized by type and dose. Type of exposure was classified as Domestic (childhood or otherwise); Bystander and Occupational. Dose of exposure was sub-classified to low-dose or substantial. Results: Age and gender matched cohorts of 55 patients with peritoneal and pleural mesothelioma were compared. There were 76% Male and 24% Female in each group. In the Peritoneal Mesothelioma group 36% had occupational exposure while 28% had bystander/domestic exposure to asbestos. In 36% exposure to asbestos was unknown. In the pleural mesothelioma group 29% had occupational exposure, 11% had bystander or domestic exposure while exposure details were unknown in 59%. 23.6% (13/55) of patients with peritoneal mesothelioma had low-dose exposure compared to 14.81% (8/55) of patients with pleural mesothelioma in our study cohort. Conclusion: This study indicates that relatively low dose exposures can result in peritoneal mesothelioma, and it supports the current understanding that there is no threshold of exposure below which peritoneal mesothelioma will not occur, similar to pleural mesothelioma.SELF-REPORTED NON-OCCUPATIONAL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION IN NEW SOUTH WALESPRAZAKOVA S 1,2,4 , JOHNSON A 3 , THOMAS P 1,2 , YATES D 4 1Inflammation and Infection Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine,  University of New South Wales, NSW 2052, 2 Respiratory Medicine, Prince  of Wales Hospital, NSW 2031, 3 Respiratory Medicine, Liverpool Hospital,  NSW 2170, 4 Thoracic Medicine, St Vincent's Hospital, NSW 2010",

Conclusion: Although mesothelioma cells become tolerant to 20 ug/ml carboplatin, we could not propose a mechanistic explanation for this tolerance from changes in expression of genes implicated in known drug resistance mechanisms.

Male sex and smoking are strongly associated risk factors for PSP. We analysed population data on the incidence of SP in Western Australia (WA) between 1969-2012. Methods: We searched the WA Department of Health hospital morbidity database for coded diagnosis of SP and any concurrent or subsequent code for lung disease. Australian Bureau of Statistics data for population number were used to calculate incidence rates and smoking prevalence. As PSP affects teenagers we defined 'adult' as age 14 upwards. Results: 17,151 episodes of SP were retrieved on 12,577 patients (97.4% adults), 2,702 (21.5%) patients had 2 or more admissions. In adults there were 12,484 PSP admissions and 4,294 for SSP. For PSP, median age was 37 (IQR 23-61) years, 67.4% were male; for SSP median age was 65 (IQR 48.5-74) years, 66.1% male. For males with PSP, incidence (per 100,000) in 1971-1980 was 23.08, females 9.00; in 2001-2010 the incidence was 27.96 and 16.01 respectively (Chi-square for trend p = 0.02 for males and p < 0.0001 for females). For males with SSP, incidence (per 100,000) in 1971-1980 was 3.55, females 1.19; in 2001-2010 the incidence was 11.32 and 6.88 respectively (Chi-square for trend p < 0.0001 for males and females). Age standardized rates of current smokers in Australia for males aged over 18 years fell from 45.5% in 1977 to 20.4% in 2011 and declined from 29.1% in 1977 to 16.3% in 2011 for females. Conclusions: The incidence of PSP in the population is rising, and at a greater rate in females, despite falling prevalence of smoking. The incidence of SP is also rising, equally between sexes, perhaps reflecting previous smoking practice.COHORT AND PERIOD EFFECTS ARE EVIDENT IN SPIROMETRY PREDICTIVE EQUATIONSNEWBURY W, LORIMER M, CROCKETT A University of AdelaideAim: Lung age can be used to communicate spirometry results to smokers, as part of smoking cessation counselling; however research results using lung age have been inconclusive. Our aim was to determine if Morris lung age (LA) equations, based on data gathered in the 1960s, are relevant for current-day populations. Methods: New LA equations were created based on recent Australian data. Study 1: Both Morris LA and Newbury LA were applied to two subgroups of an independent dataset (healthy never-smokers (HNS) n = 340, current smokers (CS) n = 50). Paired t-tests compared the mean LA estimates. Study 2: Further LA equations were created from previously published spirometry predictive equations for FEV1. Predicted FEV1 from each equation were plotted against age; and the six estimated LAs were compared by regression analysis in 25-74 year old HNS and CS from a large independent dataset. Earlier and more recent equations from similar regions were able to be compared (USA -Morris/Hankinson; Europe and UK -Quanjer/Falaschetti; Australia -Gore/Newbury). Results: Morris LA equation consistently estimated LA to be approximately 20 years lower than the newest LA equation, in both HNS and CS in both datasets. Predicted FEV1 increased progressively across the 40-year time span covered by these 6 equations; the associated increase in LA is evident in the successive LA equations. For each region, earlier equations predict lower FEV1 than the later equations.Conclusions:The increase in predicted FEV1 over the forty-year time span is indicative of the cohort and period effects which relate to differences in subjects linked to improved health and better nutrition, and differences in equipment used and standards applied over time. Our results support the use of recently-developed equations that are relevant to the population being studied. We hypothesize that more recently developed LA equations might have greater clinical utility for smoking cessation quit attempts.INVESTIGATING DELTA LUNG AGE USING INDEPENDENT DATANEWBURY W, LORIMER M, CROCKETT A University of AdelaideAim: Smokers have lower lung function than healthy never smokers, which results in higher lung age (LA) than chronological age. The Delta LA (DLA) equation based on FEV1/FVC from NHANES III data is multiethnic (Caucasian, African-American, Mexican) and applies to both sexes. It calculates the difference between chronological age and lung age estimates, and is purported to be superior to LA based on FEV1 alone, although this has not been verified using independent data. The aim of this study was to investigate the behaviour of Delta lung age equations in Australian independent datasets, and compare it with three LA equations based on FEV1 alone. Methods: Healthy never smokers and current smokers aged between 25 and 74 years of age were defined in three independent datasets. LA was estimated for each subject using each of the four LA equations, based on height, and observed FEV1 or FEV1/FVC ratio. For statistical analysis, a linear mixed effects model was used, with an unstructured covariance structure to account for the variability in LA equations. Separate analysis was performed for each dataset, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.01 to allow for multiple comparisons. Residuals were also explored. Results: Separate regression equations were defined from the data, for each combination of Equation Group (Hankinson, Hansen, Morris, Newbury) and Sex-Smoking Status (Male HNS, Male CS, Female HNS, Female CS). The DLA equation gives more widely varied and extremely high LA estimates than do the other equations, which is evident in all datasets. This occurs more so in CS than in HNS.Conclusion:The results using three independent datasets indicate that there is no advantage to be gained in using the DLA equation over LA equations based on FEV1 alone.FUNGAL EXPOSURE ASSESSED WITH ENZYME MEASUREMENTS IN HOMES OF PATIENTSWWITH ASTHMAAAND SARCOIDOSISRYLANDER R 1 , TERCELJ M 2 , SOLIBIR B 2 1 BioFact Env Health Research Centre, 2 Univeraity Medical Cebtre, Ljubljana, Slovenia",

However, data on LNTB are sparse. Aim: To describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics of peripheral LNTB in comparison to pulmonary TB (PTB). Methods: We conducted a case-control study comparing patients with peripheral LNTB with randomly selected patients with PTB diagnosed at a Sydney TB clinic, between January 2000 and December 2012. Epidemiological and medical data were extracted from the electronic hospital database and medical records. The data were examined for associations between LNTB and age, sex, ethnicity, BCG vaccination status and comorbidities (HIV, diabetes and chronic kidney disease) in comparison to PTB, using logistic regression in a univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: There were 213 cases with LNTB and 426 randomly selected controls with PTB. Among patients with LNTB, 74% were female and the mean age (SD) was 42 (16) years. Among patients with PTB, 43% were female and the mean age was 44(22)years. Females, 45-64 year olds, and Southern Asians had an increased risk for LNTB (Odds ratio (OR) 2.98, 95% CI 1.99 to 4.48; OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.60 and OR 3.52, 95% CI 1.34 to 9.24 respectively). Patients with diabetes were at a higher risk of PTB (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88 for LNTB). Conclusion: This is the first Australian study comparing the epidemiology of LNTB to that of PTB. An increased risk for LNTB was found among females, people aged 45-64 years and people born in Southern Asia. An increased risk for PTB was found among patients with diabetes.

Aim: To evaluate the treatment success of two community-supported directly observed therapy (cDOT) strategies (home-DOT and lunch-DOT) in comparison to traditional clinic-DOT in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. With 'home-DOT' volunteers delivered treatment at home; with 'lunch-DOT' volunteers provided treatment after patients had a free meal at a cafe contracted by MATA. Methods: We analysed NTP data of all sputum smear-positive patients commenced on TB treatment in 9 districts (aimags) of Ulaanbaatar (2010-2011) to assess treatment outcome with different DOT strategies. Treatment success included 'cure' and 'treatment completed' based on WHO definitions. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, occupation/ socioeconomic status and patient category (new, default, failure, relapse, transfer in). Results: Of 2,315 sputum smear-positive TB patients 1835 (79.3%) received clinic-DOT, 354 (15.3%) home-DOT and 126 (5.4%) lunch-DOT. Patients on cDOT were more likely to be unemployed with 47% of patients on home-DOT and 52% of patients on lunch-DOT being unemployed compared to 41% on clinic-DOT. The median age was 32 (interquartile range, IQR, 19) years in patients on clinic-DOT, 29 (IQR 22) years in patients on home-DOT and 36",

A recent audit of general respiratory units in the UK showed hospital mortality for patients undergoing NIV was 26%. 1 Aim: To assess the intubation rate, mortality rate and ABG outcomes of patients with COPD exacerbation undertaking NIV in a dedicated NIV unit and to determine predictors of intubation and mortality. Method: Data of successive COPD patients admitted with respiratory failure requiring NIV at a dedicated NIV unit in a UK hospital were collected. Intubation rate, in-hospital mortality rates and ABG data (pre NIV and one hour after NIV establishment) were analysed for admissions between February 2004 and February 2010. Results: 708 COPD patients underwent NIV. There were 19 (2.7%) intubations (hospital survival 63%) and 101(14%) deaths. Pre NIV ABG measurements (mean \u00b1 SD) were: pH 7.25 \u00b1 0.07, pCO2 (mmHg) 76. 1 \u00b1 19.1, pO2 (mmHg) 77.3 \u00b1 37.1. After 1 hour of NIV, there was a significant improvement in pH 7.32 \u00b1 0.07 and pCO2 64.2 \u00b1 17.4. pO2 78.2 \u00b1 33.9 remained unchanged. Not all NIV patients were clinically indicated for intubation. Intubated patients were more acidotic when commencing NIV (pH 7.20 \u00b1 0.08) and after 1 hour of NIV (pH 7.26 \u00b1 0.10). The leading causes of death were 1) end stage COPD, 2) elderly with frailty status and 3) other organ failure. Conclusion: NIV can be successfully performed in a dedicated NIV unit on respiratory ward in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure low intubation rates. Of those intubated, hospital survival was 63%. Those intubated were also more acidotic before and 1 hour after NIV. End stage COPD, elderly and frailty and co-morbidities accounted for a high risk of death. Key words: NIV, COPD, respiratory failure. Support: Nil. Conflict of Interest: None. Reference 1. Roberts CM et al. Thorax 2011; 66: 43-8. Aim: To examine the effect of battery powered portable oxygen concentrators (BPPOC) compared to portable oxygen cylinders on quality of life in a cohort of subjects with stable COPD requiring oxygen. Method: Twenty-three subjects with stable COPD and prescribed portable oxygen were randomized to either BPPOC or portable cylinders in a multicentre cross-over study (one month each with one-week wash-out). A standard AQoL-8D algorithm in Stata was used to produce AQoL utility scores with AQoL survey instruments completed at baseline. Eight specific dimensions (independent living, pain, senses, mental health, happiness, coping, relationships, and self-worth) were also calculated. Results: Mean AQoL-8D utility scores did not vary by oxygen modality. Exploratory analyses revealed a mean score on BPPOC of 0.56, which was almost identical to the mean score while on portable oxygen cylinders of 0.57 for patients requiring continuous oxygen (i.e. 16 hours or more a day). Mean scores on independent living, coping, relation and self-worth were slightly higher when on BPPOC than on cylinder. For patients using oxygen for exertional purposes only, the mean utility score was also the same regardless of oxygen modality. Non-parametric tests for paired difference between scores while on BPPOC and cylinder were not statistically significant for either patient group (p = 0.86 for continuous and p = 0.79 for exertional patients). The mean score across all participants and time points was significantly lower than the AQol-8D population norm (0.86). Conclusion: Utility scores are volatile over time with large differences in scores observed across the three data collection points for participants, even where modality of oxygen delivery had not changed. As such reliable conclusions about the impact of BPPOC on quality of life are difficult to discern. Overall no significant effects on quality of life were observed for use with BPPOCs, though some improvement was observed for participants requiring continuous oxygen.

Others have suggested a trend to benefit with reduced cardiovascular events and mortality with no impact on pulmonary functions. Aim: To examine the impact of beta-blockers in COPD patients on readmission, non-invasive ventilation and cardiovascular event rates. Method: Retrospective cohort study of new patients seen at Christchurch Respiratory Clinic for COPD from 01/01/2008 to 01/10/2011. Patients' notes, discharge summaries and investigations were reviewed and followed up for two years. Results: A total of 177 new COPD patients were seen in the study period. Of these 63 patients were not beta-blockers although 27 had a history of ischaemic heart disease. Only 14 patients taking beta-blockers of these 11 had a history of ischaemic heart disease. In patients not on beta-blockers the admission rate for respiratory ailments was 0.4 admissions per patient year and non-invasive ventilation rate of 0.08 (95% CI 0-0.23); patients on betablockers had rates of 0.4 and 0.1 respectively. Cardiac event rates were 0.06 in group not on beta blockers and 0.18 on beta-blockers (p 0.02). When corrected for presence of heart disease, the cardiac event rates were 0.12 and 0.18 respectively (p 0.4). Conclusion: Less than 10% of patients with COPD were taking betablockers despite traditional indications for beta-blocker use. None of the outcome measures reached statistically significant besides a higher number of cardiac event rates in the beta-blocker group; it lost significance when corrected for presence of ischaemic heart disease.

This analysis reports the efficacy and safety of QVA149 vs. SFC in the sub-group population using fixeddose LABA/ICS prior to study enrolment. Method: 122 pts on LABA/ICS prior to study entry were randomized to QVA149 (n = 54) and SFC (n = 68). FEV1 area under the curve for 0-12 h (AUC0-12h), pre-dose trough FEV1, rescue medication use, exacerbations and safety were assessed after 26 wks. Results: QVA149 significantly improved FEV1 AUC0-12h, pre-dose trough FEV1 and reduced rescue medication use in COPD pts regardless of previous LABA/ICS use at study entry (Table) . Number of exacerbations (QVA149: 23; SFC: 41) and pts with incidence of adverse events (QVA149: 50%; SFC: 55.9%) was numerically lower with QVA149. Conclusion: In the subpopulation previously treated with LABA/ICS, QVA149 demonstrated significant improvements in lung function and rescue therapy use compared to SFC. These results were consistent with the overall study population.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether dietary nitrate administered as beetroot juice can enhance exercise capacity in subjects with COPD and if it is a safe dietary supplement for this population. Method: 19 patients with COPD had lung function testing, incremental shuttle walk test and endurance shuttle walk test to assess exercise capacity. Patients also completed a safety phase; postural blood pressure, heart rate and symptoms were recorded periodically up to 4 hours post consumption of beetroot juice. Results: 19 subjects have completed the safety phase. An insignificant change in systolic pressure was observed at post consumption of the beetroot juice (mean decrease 5.03 mmHg; maximum 30 mmHg). An insignificant drop in postural systolic pressure was observed post dose compared to baseline (5.42 vs 8.58 mmHg). Postural heart rate response was similar pre and post consumption (8.26 vs 8.11). Conclusion: Ingestion of dietary nitrate caused an insignificant drop in systolic pressure in subjects with COPD. One patient developed symptomatic postural hypotension and was therefore excluded from the study. On the basis of these results, we believe it is a safe dietary supplement for this patient population. On completion of the study, the effect of dietary nitrate on exercise capacity will be reported. Aim: 1. Examine the relationship between exacerbations of COPD, occurrence of cardiovascular events and mortality and \u00df-blocker therapy. 2. Review utilization of \u00df-blockers in patients admitted with an exacerbation of COPD. Method: Retrospective review of 100 patients admitted to The Prince Charles Hospital prior to 31 December 2012 with an exacerbation of COPD. Medical records were evaluated for history of IHD, heart failure/ cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia. Information on smoking history, lung function and \u00df-blocker prescription was collected. Frequency of cardiovascular events before and after the admission was documented. Results: 86 patient records were evaluated. Fifty-five patients (64%) had a history of cardiac disease. Of the patients with COPD and cardiac disease, 36 patients (65.5%) were not on \u00df-blockers. Of this group, 15 patients had a history of cardiac failure. 21% of patients on \u00df-blockers were either readmitted to hospital with cardiovascular events or died within six months, compared to 19.4% for the group not on \u00df-blockers. The group not on \u00df-blockers had poorer lung function (mean FEV1 1.5 litres, compared with 1.42 litres for those on \u00df-blockers). 25% required readmission to hospital with an exacerbation of COPD within 6 months of the admission compared with 21% in the \u00df-blocker group. Conclusion: Patients with COPD and a cardiac indication for \u00df-blockers are frequently not receiving this therapy. Patients not on \u00df-blocker therapy had a lower average FEV1, which may have contributed to their physicians' decision not to commence \u00df-blocker therapy. The rate of COPD exacerbations however was similar between the two groups. There was no association between \u00df-blocker therapy and reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in patients admitted to hospital with exacerbations of COPD. Our study has identified a patient population with COPD and cardiac disease not receiving \u00df-blocker therapy. Key words: beta blockers, COPD, cardiovascular.",

From 1981 to 2005, the prevalence of obesity has increased while the prevalence of SB has remained stable. 1.140 in 1994 with 2005 being between these two values at 1.096. Thus an increase of 1 kg/m 2 in BMI was associated with a 6.5% to 14.0% increase in the odds of having SB. Further adjustment for smoking, recent wheeze, cough/phlegm, diagnosed asthma, diagnosed bronchitis, dusty job, family history of asthma or family history of hay fever, FEV (% predicted), chest pain/angina & level of exercise only slightly attenuated the OR to 1.060, 1.107 & 1.071 respectively for 1981, 1994 & 2005. In all cases the effect of BMI on SB was stronger in women but was not significant after multivariable adjustment.

[1] Despite this, there are limited approaches to specialist respiratory care in rural and remote communities that are culturally appropriate. The Indigenous Respiratory Outreach Care (IROC) is to enhance specialist respiratory services (both adults and paediatrics) in rural and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and enrich community capacity to reduce the burden of lung disease. Method: A multi-disciplinary steering committee governs the programme. Multi-disciplinary teams (incorporating specialist nurses, doctors, Indigenous Health Workers (IHW's) and scientists) service five Queensland Heath Service Districts. Sites were identified based on a perception of unmet need, burden of respiratory disease and/or capacity to utilize the clinical service and capacity building support offered. IROC services include intensive pre and post support and follow up, ongoing training of IHW's and health staff, enhancing community awareness of respiratory issues and the development and dissemination of culturally appropriate education materials. Results: The service commenced in March 2011. To date, IROC has been implemented or received support for, in 12 communities (both rural and urban). Early data suggest that the service is being received positively by communities and local health service providers with high clinic attendance and IHW's involvement. In some regions, new diagnoses of paediatric chronic lung disease that were not previously recognized have been detected. Conclusion: The delivery of culturally sensitive specialist respiratory services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults and children is critical to addressing the excess burden of disease in this population. IROC provides a successful model for achieving this goal that is readily transferrable to other regions in Australia. Key words: respiratory disease, Indigenous and rural. Aim: Respiratory diseases are the leading cause of hospitalization (1) and the 4th leading cause of mortality of Aboriginal people accounting for 8.7 % of all deaths. (1) Despite this, there is limited understanding of Aboriginal Peoples' perspectives on respiratory health and community attitudes to services aimed at reducing the burden of disease. The aim of this study was to identify from an Aboriginal perspective individual and community knowledge and awareness of, and attitudes to, respiratory health. Method: We employed a mixed methods approach of cross-sectional surveys and yarning circles (focus groups) with young people and adults in two rural/remote Aboriginal Queensland communities. All data were collected by an Aboriginal researcher (LM). Cross sectional data were analysed using both descriptive and analytical statistical methods. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results: Over a two week period in two communities, 233 were screened and 187 enrolled. Of those enrolled, 71.6% were female and 83.4% were aged 18 years and over. One hundred and 21 participants completed a survey and 45 people engaged in yarning's. Major issues identified were a lack of knowledge about respiratory symptoms and the respiratory system and that respiratory health was not a priority unless there were current symptoms. Conclusion: Despite the burden and origins of respiratory disease, lung health is not a priority. To reduce the burden of disease and impact on future lung health, awareness of respiratory health needs to be enhanced. Introduction: There is frequently marked geographical variation in the bacteriology of pleural cultures and differences in nosocomial and community acquired bacteriology. We undertook an analysis of all pleural fluid cultures from the public hospitals in the Perth metro area, Western Australia. Method: Data were extracted from the PathWest microbiology laboratory database on any episodes coded to have a positive pleural fluid culture between 2006 to 2011. Casenote and stored electronic health record data were reviewed for demographics, length of stay, survival, biochemistry and systemic inflammatory markers. Results: 713 cases with 968 positive cultures were available for analysis. Median age was 63.7 years, 502/713 (70.4%) were male and 418/713 (58.6%) right sided. 153 different organisms were isolated; the main isolates are summarized: 11.9% Staphylococcus aureus, 9.49% Streptococcus viridans, 9.11% other aerobes (mixed), 7.12% S. angiosus group, 6.24% gram-negative rods, 5.12% pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.12% E. coli, 3.62% Klebsiella spp., 3.37% MRSA. Analysis also revealed organisms never before reported in association with pleural infection (e.g. Klebsiella oxytoca). Median (IQR) pleural fluid pH was 7.30 (6.69-7.59), glucose 2.7 mmol/L (0.5-5.8), LDH 800 iu/L (248-3188), white cell count 12.7 \u00d7 10 9 (8.98-17.4), c-reactive protein 172 mg/L (74-280). Median survival following infection was 68.0 days (20.0-322.0). 151 cases had community-acquired infection (CAI) and 298 hospital-acquired infection (HAI). Compared to HAI, CAI had more isolates of S. angiosus and S. viridans groups (both p < 0.05) and HAI had more MRSA, Enterococci, Klebsiella spp. (all p < 0.05). One-year survival was greater with CAI (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.55; p = 0.014). Conclusions: Elucidation of local bacteriology for pleural infection may reveal unique isolates and patterns. In this population, pleural infection is associated with a poor prognosis. Important differences exist in the bacteriology and outcomes of community and hospital acquired infection.",

Accurate diagnosis and specific treatment improves outcomes. Galactomannan (GM) is a major constituent of Aspergillus cell walls released during hyphal growth, indicating active replication. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) GM may increase diagnostic accuracy but the optimal optical density (OD) cut-off has not been determined, and our earlier data suggests it may be different in sub-groups of immunocompromised patients. Aims: Evaluate utility and determine optimal OD of BAL GM in diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis in sub-groups of immunocompromised patients. Method: Immunocompromised patients requiring bronchoscopy for surveillance or clinical indications over a three year period. Patients were grouped into the following categories for analysis: human immunodeficiency virus infection, thoracic transplant recipients, other solid-organ transplant, haematological malignancy, bone marrow transplantation recipient etc. BAL specimens were analysed for GM using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Optimal OD was calculated using receiver operating characteristic analysis compared with the current gold standard -direct microscopy and fungal cultures. Results: 233 bronchoscopies were performed. Fungal elements were negative in all but 2 patients. There were 26 positive fungal cultures positive for Aspergillus and this was used as the gold standard in comparison with GM. As an overall group, the optimal OD was 0.6. Subsets of immunocompromised patients were also assessed. The thoracic transplant recipients group and allogenic bone marrow transplant recipients/acute leukaemias group both had an optimal OD of 0.5. Oncological malignancy and lymphoma patients had a higher optimal OD of 0.9. Conclusions: BAL GM increases early detection of pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. The optimal OD cut off differs between subgroups. The reason for immunosuppression should be considered when interpreting GM results. Aim: Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is the leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. The most common cause of viral respiratory infections is human rhinovirus (HRV). Despite high ALRI-associated mortality, the role of viruses in childhood ALRI in sub-Saharan Africa is poorly understood. We aimed to describe the viral aetiology of ALRI in hospitalized children in rural Mozambique. Method: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 180 children <10 years of age admitted to Manhi\u00e7a District Hospital with a fever and (WHO defined) clinical pneumonia as part of a study characterizing children with respiratory distress. HIV and malaria testing was offered and patients underwent chest X-ray and extensive clinical and laboratorial screening. Respiratory viruses (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, metapnuemovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, influenza and coronavirus) were identified using two independent multiplex RT-PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and virus type. HRV species and genotypes were identified using a molecular method involving RNA extraction, semi-nested PCR amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis. Results: A total of 180 children (49.4% male) with a mean age of 20.8 months were recruited. Twenty-five (13.9%) children were HIV-positive. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 150 (83.3%) children while co-infection with two, three and four viruses were identified in 47 (26.1%), 11 (6.1%) and 3 (1.7%) children respectively. HRV was the most common (51.7%) virus identified, followed by adenovirus (15.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.6%), parainfluenza virus (10%), metapnuemovirus (8.3%), bocavirus (8.3%), enterovirus (6.1%), influenza (5.0%) and coronavirus (1.7%). Of the 76 HRV genotyped specimens, 41 (53.9%) were HRV-A, 28 (36.8%) were HRV-C and 7 (9.2%) were HRV-B. HRV was associated with HIV-infection (p = 0.028) and respiratory symptoms including wheezing (p = 0.005). Conclusion: HRV is likely to contribute to ALRI in hospitalized children in Mozambique. HIV has a strong impact on viral infections. Key words: human rhinovirus, acute lower respiratory infections.",

Guidelines suggest antipyretic use; however fever may have a protective effect and antipyretics increase mortality in animal influenza models. We investigated the effects of paracetamol on viral shedding and clinical symptoms in adults with influenza. Methods: In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial 80 participants with an influenza-like illness received paracetamol or placebo for five days. Temperature was recorded for five days and symptom scores were recorded until day 14. Pernasal swabs were taken for quantitative viral load RT-PCR analysis at baseline, day one, two, and five. The primary outcome variable was area under the curve quantitative PCR viral load over days zero to five. Results: 80 subjects were enrolled with none lost to follow up. Twenty two participants in the control group and 24 in the paracetamol group were PCR positive for influenza. There was no significant difference between the groups in the primary outcome measure. The AUC for quantitative PCR Log 10 viral load over days 0 to 5 (control group minus paracetamol group) was \u22120.24, 95% CI \u22120.78 to 0.29 (P = 0.36). There was no significant difference between the groups in the secondary virological or clinical outcomes. Regular paracetamol had no significant effect on temperature or symptoms compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: Regular paracetamol had no significant effect on temperature, symptoms, or viral shedding in patients with influenza. There was a lower than expected positive PCR rate hence the study may have been underpowered to detect a difference. The lack of efficacy of paracetamol as an antipyretic meant we were not able to sufficiently suppress fever. Further work is required in order to define the role of fever in influenza infection. Until then the regular administration of paracetamol as an antipyretic in influenza cannot be recommended.",

Methods: The benign MeT-5A pleural mesothelial cell line was treated with live or heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (reference strains and clinical isolates) or Streptococcal species for up to 24 hr. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release was determined by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. S. aureus-conditioned media was subject to protein fractionation based on molecular weight using Amicon\u00ae Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore). Results: Live, but not heat-killed, S. aureus reference strains induced IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF release from MeT-5A cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner. This result was verified using S. aureus clinical isolates obtained from blood cultures. Conversely, Streptococcus pneumoniae or S. milleri group bacteria did not induce cytokine release from MeT-5A cells. S. aureus-induced IL-6 and VEGF, but not IL-8, release was mediated via a bacterial exoproduct, which was resistant to heat, deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease treatment. Selective ultra-filtration of S. aureus conditioned media revealed that the cytokine-inducing activity was retained in concentrates containing exoproducts <30 kDa in size. Conclusions: Of the most common bacterial empyema pathogens only S. aureus induced the release of the cytokines tested from pleural mesothelial cells in vitro. The results using heat-killed bacteria and conditioned media indicate the causative factor is an actively secreted product from S. aureus.",

Although CPAP is highly effective in controlling OSA, overall adherence rates are poor. Aim: To assess CPAP compliance and outcomes amongst successive patients who attended the Sleep Investigation Service at Royal North Shore Hospital. In addition we evaluated whether patients valued the CPAP education service. Methods: A retrospective audit was conducted for the period January to July 2012. One hundred and fifty, consecutive OSA patients were identified initially as requiring CPAP titration studies and a questionnaire was sent via mail. Attempts to contact the remaining participants by phone were made on a maximum of 2 occasions. Result: Thirty-three out of the 150(22%) surveyed participants responded to the mailed questionnaire. An additional 24 patients completed a verbal questionnaire by phone, giving a total of 57 respondents.Forty-nine out of 57 patients (86%) went on to trial CPAP at home. 60% were still currently using CPAP.

            "text": "Introduction: Excessive daytime sleepiness is common in OSA and can be reversed by CPAP. Reduced daytime sleepiness may enhance BEE, and this effect could potentially be useful for objectively monitoring CPAP efficacy in OSA. Aim: We examined whether BEE increased in OSA patients after commencement of CPAP therapy, and whether increased BEE correlated with improvements in subjective measures of sleepiness and functional outcomes. Methods: 7 men with recently diagnosed OSA (age 46 \u00b1 14 years; apnoeahypopnoea index 32 \u00b1 15/h) were studied. BEE was estimated with a small validated actigraphic device (Actiheart, CamNtech Neurotechnology Ltd, Cambridge UK) which estimates and records BEE over extended periods. BEE was continuously estimated over 3 1-week periods: 1-2 weeks prior to, 1-2 weeks after, and 5-6 weeks after, commencement of CPAP therapy. Each subject also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-30) at the end of each of the three study weeks. Results: During the 8-week study period, significant improvements occurred in BEE (9,527 \u00b1 4,309 vs. 12,038 \u00b1 5,109 kJ/day, P = 0.0011), ESS (10.5 \u00b1 2.5 vs. 3.0 \u00b1 2.2, P < 0.0001) and the FOSQ-30 (3.2 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 3.8 \u00b1 0.1, Introduction: Clinic studies report an association of untreated OSA and diabetes. However, a recent systematic review found little evidence of a longitudinal association. Aim: To examine the relationship between previously undiagnosed OSA with diabetes and pre-diabetes in community-dwelling men aged \u226540 years. Methods: The Men Androgen Inflammation Lifestyle Environment and Stress (MAILES) Study is a longitudinal population-based cohort assessing diabetes status over time. At cohort follow-up only (2011-12), n = 837 underwent full in-home unattended polysomnography (PSG, Embletta X100). Clinic assessments at both stages included anthropometry, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and self-reported chronic conditions (including diabetes) and risk factors. Diabetes was defined as self-reported physician diagnosis/ FPG \u2265 7.0 mmol/L/ HbA1c \u2265 6.5%/ diabetes medication use, and pre-diabetes was FPG 6.1-6.9 or HbA1c 5.7-6.4 (in those without diabetes). Cross-sectional analyses examined relationships between PSG indices and prevalent and incident diabetes/pre-diabetes cases. To determine longitudinal relationships in the absence of baseline PSG data, we identified probable longstanding OSA, defined as apneoa hypopnea index (AHI) \u226510/h at follow-up who also had OSA symptoms at baseline (2006-7) and stable weight over follow-up. Results: In cross-sectional analyses, significant age adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for prevalent diabetes [2.42 (1.41-4.17) ] or incident diabetes [2.15 (1.04-4.43) ] associated with severe OSA (AHI \u2265 30) did not persist after additional adjustment for obesity. Longitudinal analyses showed that longstanding OSA was not significantly associated with incident diabetes [age-adjusted OR: 1.55 (0.74-3.23)] but was significantly associated with incident pre-diabetes [1.83 (1.00-3.35) , p = 0.049] after adjustment for age, obesity, smoking, physical activity, sleepiness and grip strength. There were no significant relationships of oxygen desaturation index (3%) \u226516 or time oxygen saturation <90% \u22654%, persisting after age and obesity adjustment. Conclusions: In a population-based sample of men, longstanding OSA was independently associated with the development of pre-diabetes or impaired glycaemic control.Background: Fabry Disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency in the enzyme alpha-galactosidase resulting in excessive intracellular storage of globotriaosylceramide. There is a paucity of objective sleep data in FD, however important clinical and physiological features of FD include pain, renal impairment, obstructive lung disease, thickening of the soft and hard palate, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral neuropathy. We hypothesize that these abnormalities are likely to increase the prevalence of sleep disorders in FD. Methods: Clinical sleep assessment and analysis of in-laboratory polysomnograms (PSG) of male Fabry patients (n = 11) were recruited from the Victorian Fabry cohort. Analysis of PSG was conducted by a sleep scientist and reported by a sleep physician with particular attention to identifying for sleep-disordered breathing (AHI > 5 events/hour) and/or periodic leg movement disorders (periodic leg movements >15/hour). Results: A total of 11 patients (mean \u00b1 SD), age = 43 \u00b1 8 years completed overnight PSG. Baseline characteristics included: BMI = 23.3 \u00b1 3.7, neck circumference = 38.95 \u00b1 12.19. Sleep disordered breathing was identified in 36% (95% C.I. 15.1, 64.6) of patients and periodic leg movements were present in 91% (95% C.I. 62.2, 98.3) of patients. All patients with sleep-disordered breathing had significant periodic leg movements. Of the tested group 11/11 were on enzyme replacement therapy at the time of testing. Conclusions: Sleep disturbance in FD is likely to be multifactorial with patients having a higher prevalence of periodic leg movement disorder than the general population (approximately 4%). The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing is slightly higher than the prevalence in large population studies (approximately 24%). Interventions are available for these symptoms and may improve quality of life.",

            "text": "Aim: To determine whether SA road safety is harmed by the mandatory reporting law requiring doctors to report any driver whom they believed 'would be likely to endanger the public'. Method: Structured surveys were mailed to all 57 SA doctors who were either sleep qualified consultants, advanced trainees in sleep or electrocardiologists. Results: Response rate was 61% (n = 35) with all respondents indicating awareness of the law, however 74% (n = 26) disagreed with it. Few doctors (23%) thought they were the best person to determine fitness to drive, and only 15% had received any form of training regarding making that determination. Nearly all (97%) had seen patients who 'would be likely to endanger the public' if they drove yet only 12% reported all patients in accordance with current legislation. Most doctors suspected at least some patients of lying (94%), doctor shopping (71%) or discouraging others from seeking medical help (66%) as a consequence of the law. Whilst 52% of sleep doctors used clinical data to determine who should be reported there was little consistency as Epworth Sleepiness Scale reporting thresholds ranged from 8-16 and Apnoea/Hypopnea Index thresholds ranged from 20-50. Eighty per cent of all doctors had received abuse due to the law and 66% knew of other staff members who had also been abused, totalling over 300 incidents of abuse (no known injuries). Conclusion: Widely disliked, the mandatory reporting law is ignored by some doctors and inconsistently applied by most. This coupled with the adverse and even abusive behaviour of patients as a consequence of the law means that a review of the mandatory aspect of the legislation is called for. Aim: To determine the effectiveness of Transcutanous monitoring (tc) of arterial tensions of Oxygen (pO2) and Carbon Dioxide (pCO2) compared to Arterial Blood Gasses (ABG) during the Hypoxic Altitiude Simulation Test (HAST) in patients with COPD and other respiratory diseases. Method: Currently five outpatients have been included as part of a clinically requested HAST procedure to assess fitness for airline travel and the benefit of supplemental O2 during the flight. The HAST was conducted under the condition of FiO215% concentration and FiO215% plus supplemental O2 at 2 L/min or 4 L/min to maintain pO2 \u2265 60 mmHg. pCO2 and pO2 (mmHg) of room air baseline, FiO215% and FiO215% plus supplemental O2 values were compared with ABG sampling and tc by Radiometer Pacific TCM40. Paired t-tests were used to compare differences between ABG results and tc results, p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",

A Bland-Altman plot was used to measure the agreement between the two methods with a smaller range indicating a better clinical utility for tc. For pO2 measurements the 95% CI range from \u22123, 3.3 (baseline); \u22126.8, 8.6 (FiO215%); \u22126.6, 7.6 (FiO215% + O2). For pCO2 measurements the 95% CI range from \u22121.2, 3.8 (baseline); \u22122, 2.4 (FiO215%); \u22122.9, 5 (FiO215% + O2). From this small data set, 78.6% of the measurements for tcpO2 are within 3 mmHg and for tcpCO2 100% are within 3 mmHg. Conclusion: Our sample size to date indicates a close association between the two methods. These findings, coupled with the simpler, continuous and non-invasive nature of Transcutaneous monitoring warrants further investigation. (5), emphysema (4), ILD (4), and drug-related lung disease (3). A diagnosis was also made in seven of the patients with an isolated reduction in DLCO, including ILD (2), drug-related lung disease (2), pulmonary hypertension (1). Conclusion: Isolated reduction in DLCO, whether persistent or not, often leads to a clinical diagnosis. Those with a persistent reduction are more likely to develop spirometric abnormalities.Aim: Standard protocols for physical activity (PA) monitoring require four to five days of monitoring including at least one weekend day. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal duration for PA monitoring in people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS Introduction: Hypoxaemic respiratory failure (HRF) is common and associated with a high mortality. While non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly recognized as an important treatment modality for hypercapnic respiratory failure, the place of NIV in the management of HRF is less well defined. Aim: This study sought to identify clinical factors associated with outcome in patients admitted to a ward-based respiratory high dependency unit (RHDU) with HRF. Method: A retrospective cohort study focused on the Princess Alexandra Hospital RHDU was conducted. All patients admitted to the RHDU with HRF, between January 2007 and December 2011, were included in this study. Details of clinical factors and outcome were obtained from the RHDU database.Results: 213 patients were included in this study. Survival to hospital discharge was more likely to occur in those with acute HRF (p = 0.013), asthma (p = 0.002), obstructive sleep apnoea (p = 0.027) and gastrointestinal comorbidities (p = 0.023). In contrast, death in hospital was more likely to occur in patients with poor performance status, both usual performance status (p < 0.001) and performance status on admission to the RHDU (p = 0.025). Death was also more likely in those with prior use of home oxygen therapy (p = 0.036), interstitial lung disease (p < 0.001), non-small cell lung cancer (p = 0.009), non-respiratory malignancy (p = 0.006) and early discontinuation of NIV (p = 0.002). Intensive care unit transfer was more likely to occur in those with short length of stay in the RHDU (p < 0.001), pneumonia (p = 0.034), acute HRF (p = 0.03), NIV use (p = 0.03), short period of NIV use (p = 0.004), RHDU complications (p < 0.001) and increased number of RHDU complications (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Multiple clinical factors are associated with outcome in patients admitted to a RHDU with HRF.",

Telehealth is a successful niche technology and could be ideally suited to assist in the provision of effective health services in respiratory and sleep medicine especially where discussion between patient and doctor is more important. Aim: To describe the implementation and outcomes of telehealth outpatient consultations from the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) and Alice Springs Hospital (ASH) to remote clinic sites.Method: After liaising with information technology, nursing and administrative staff, a workplace instruction detailing the organization of staff and equipment, triaging of referrals and clinic workflow chart was created. Data were collected on diagnosis, consultation process, patient feedback and cost savings. Results: 37 consultations were performed on 27 patients (predominantly follow-up reviews) between May and October 2013. Consultations were provided in Port Augusta and Whyalla (300 and 381 km from RAH respectively) and Tennant Creek (500 km from ASH) in the presence of a nurse to assist the patient. Main diagnoses seen were obstructive sleep apnoea, restless leg syndrome, COPD and cystic fibrosis. Only 1 consultation required a subsequent face-to-face review. Overall patient feedback was extremely positive with minor suggestions for improvement. Cost savings to Patient Assistance Transport Scheme totalled $2602. Barriers to telehealth implementation include availability of equipment and remote nursing staff.",
