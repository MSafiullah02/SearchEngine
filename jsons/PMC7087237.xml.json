Since its discovery, hMPV has been identified on several continents including America, Australia, Asia and Europe, and was thought to be prevalent worldwide [8, 16, 19, 25]. hMPV resembles human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) with regard to its clinical presentation and ability to infect and cause disease in young children, elderly persons and immunocompromised patients [4, 7, 9, 14, 17, 20, 29]. As reinfection of hMPV may occur frequently throughout a human\u2019s life, the evolution of variant virus, which leads to severe pathologic outcomes, requires extensive attention.",

The genome of hMPV, from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032, is organized as follows: N-P-M-F-M2-1/M2-2-SH-G-L [22, 23, 27, 32]. Similar to the avian metapneumovirus (AMPV), hMPV lacks nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 and posses three surface glycoproteins, the fusion (F), attachment (G), and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. The G protein attaches to host cells, whereas the F protein directly mediates membrane fusion [15]. It is known that the greatest genetic diversity among hMPV strains occurs in the structural genes; therefore, both G and F genes have been widely used for phylogenetic analysis in the context of genetic lineages [2, 3, 10, 28].",

The fusion domain (23 a.a. residues in length) is highly hydrophobic and located at the N-terminus of the F1 subunit. Several heptad repeats (HR) in the F protein are also critical for membrane fusion [2, 15, 27]. HRA (a.a.127\u2013169) is located at the carboxyl terminal end of the fusion peptide.

However, it is currently unclear whether the variations in the F gene that lead to alterations of F protein\u2019s functional motifs are the main determinants of the epidemic features of hMPV. In addition, F protein has been demonstrated to contain major antigenic determinants that mediate extensive cross-lineage neutralization [3, 23] and cross-protective immunity [11]. Detailed analysis of the sequence variation of F genes among clinical isolates is therefore critical for defining the molecular evolution of the F gene and may provide clues to understanding the epidemic features of the virus.",

Viral RNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcl of respiratory specimens or viral culture fluids using the QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and the fusion gene was amplified by one-step RT-PCR (QIAGEN) following manufacturer-suggested procedures. Briefly, 5 \u03bcl of RNA was added to the RT-PCR mixture, which contained 2 \u03bcl of QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR enzyme mixture, 10 \u03bcl of 5\u00d7 QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR buffer, 400 \u03bcM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and 0.6 \u03bcM of each primer in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. Cycling conditions were as follows: 30 min at 50\u00b0C for RT reaction, 5 min at 95\u00b0C for RT inactivation, followed by 35 cycles of PCR reaction (94\u00b0C for 1 min, 54\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min) with an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products derived from approximately 40% (23/59) of the hMPV-positive specimens were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN), and both sense and anti-sense strands of the PCR products were sequenced by an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems).",

The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) showed that two distinct hMPV genogroups (A and B) with at least four possible subgroup lineages (A1, A2, B1, and B2) were co-circulating during the study period. Subgroup A2 was further divided into A2a and A2b lineages with the bootstrap values of 81 and 63%, respectively. Since the A2b bootstrap value was less than the 75% limit, the phylogenic relationship between A2a and A2b was re-evaluated by maximum likelihood and parsimony methods (data not shown). The re-evaluation supported the presence of two distinct lineages for the A2 subgroup. hMPV A2 strains were more frequently identified in children during the study period (15 out of 23 strains), and A1 variants were frequently detected in 2005 from March to May (Table 2).\n\n",

We have previously identified an outbreak of hMPV infection from children in southern Taiwan from March to May 2004, and compared the clinical manifestations of hMPV with other virus-associated respiratory tract infections [30]. In this study, we provide genetic evidence identifying the major circulating viral variants that may contribute to the epidemic features of hMPV infection in a longer period from September 2003 to August 2005. Our results revealed all five defined hMPV lineages in southern Taiwan and indicated that the variants in subgroup A2 were more frequently identified in the study period. Seasonality was observed for hMPV infection in southern Taiwan, as hMPV activities were frequently observed during spring and summer months. Overall, the peak of infection in southern Taiwan was similar to that in California in 2004 [6, 31], with less hMPV activity observed in the fall and winter in southern Taiwan. This trend of hMPV infection was observed during both years of the 2-year study period and was similar to high and low incidences in other reports [10, 24].",

Furthermore, children were infected more frequently by group A strains, which agrees with Boivin et al. [4] and suggests that age may be a critical fitness factor for group A strains. Also, Boivin et al. [4] have noted a possible shift of infection towards A2 strains in recent years. This was supported by our observation that 75% of the strains from the hMPV-positive specimens belonged to the A2 genotype. It is possible that the co-circulation pattern among children in southern Taiwan is similar throughout the world, and the genetic variations in the A2 subgroup may have certain functional relevance critical for the transmission. On the other hand, a recent report has described a complex circulation pattern based on the sequence variations within the G gene, and certain variations were critical for evading preexisting immunity [13].",

Specimens from two of the individuals were obtained from throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates collected on the same day. The third individual contributed 2 hMPV-positive specimens that were obtained 45 days apart and became hMPV-negative after 231 days. No respiratory specimens were collected from this patient during the 45-day period of the two positive specimens. According to the identical F gene of the two strains, we considered these two consecutive positive specimens to be the result of prolonged shedding of hMPV.",

We have previously reported that hMPV also contributes substantially to acute respiratory tract infections in children of Taiwan with respiratory symptoms and signs similar to those of other RV infections, except for the severity of skin rash and duration of fever, together with the presentation of feeding difficulties, tachycardia, and minimal cough [31]. This study further supports the unique epidemic pattern of hMPV in children in southern Taiwan based on the genetic analysis of F gene. These hMPV variants simultaneously circulate with seasonal distribution and may account for many of the undiagnosed infections in Taiwan.",
