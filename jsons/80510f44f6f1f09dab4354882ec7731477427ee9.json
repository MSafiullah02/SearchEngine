The human microbiome project (HMP) was launched by NIH in 2007 as a part of a road map for medical research. The HMP serves as a template for researchers who are studying more than 1,000 microbial genomes with a focus on their role in health and disease. The study samples have been derived from fi ve human body regions that are known to be inhabited by microbial fl ora. These include the gastrointestinal tract, female urogenital tract, mouth, nose, and skin. The techniques being used include fi nger printing, sequencing, dynamic range, and comparison of multiple samples. It is now well accepted that there are more microbial cells than human cells in the human body. Just the gastrointestinal tract harbors more than tenfold micro-bial cells than the number of human cells in the entire body. The understanding of the relationship between microbes and humans is at best rudimentary at this point in time. Similarly, the relationship between humans and microbes in the environment and environmental surfaces is poorly understood except for a few pathogenic microbes.",

In the area of infectious diseases and infection control, we typically look at individual diseases caused by single organisms. Conventionally microbes are thought of as bad actors because the emphasis is on disease rather than interaction between human and microbial cells. The protective role of a large number of bacterial species that exist on and around us has largely been minimized. In fact, these bacteria should be referred to as \"Nature's Bioshield.\" Their association with the areas they were put in by nature is strong and symbiotic. Since they are common to healthy individuals, their transmission from person to person is of no relevance. We know now that the disruption of this bioshield by physical injury and its alteration by the selection process from antibiotic use are the most signifi cant risk factors for developing infectious diseases including those caused by multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their transmission to others in the health-care as well as community settings.",

For example, in 1841, Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, attempted to mandate hand washing and change of coats used in autopsy rooms before examining patients or performing deliveries. He believed that invisible agents can be transferred particularly from autopsy room to delivery room thus infecting mothers during birthing. He built this belief from his observation that the death rates in the ward that was run by physicians were 18 % more than that in the ward run by midwives. He contributed that to the fact that physicians were working in autopsy rooms and the midwives were not. Also one of his colleagues died after he cut himself during an autopsy on a patient who had died from puerperal fever/sepsis. His colleagues did not accept the concept despite the fact that the death rate in the hospital dropped by 66 % after applying the two interventions. It is diffi cult to comprehend why Dr. Semmelweis faced opposition despite the success of his measures. The question was and remains today: Is it hard to apply these practices or are we not able to meaningfully convey the principles?",

Perhaps this is because the consequences of noncompliance are not obvious right away and it is hard to point to a single action that caused the incident. It is a fact that those we ask to comply with infection prevention practices do not have a clear understanding of the microbial world at large and therefore the principles. This has made it diffi cult and at times impossible to have an optimal adherence with these practices. We believe that it is absolutely necessary to convey to health-care providers of all levels the signifi cance of the microbial fl ora on and around us, the factors that put them at risk for acquiring and subsequently transmitting disease-causing pathogens to patients at high risk of developing infectious processes due to multiple factors including age, immunocompromise, and comorbid conditions.

Most aerobic bacteria are able to also grow under anaerobic condition and are facultative anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes, on the other hand, grow only in the absence of oxygen.

S. aureus colonizes the skin and mucous membranes of 30-50 % of healthy adults and children, most commonly in the anterior nares, skin, vagina, and rectum [ 1 ] . In addition to coagulase, S. aureus has a number of virulence factors including exotoxins such as enterotoxin, exfoliative toxin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1. The primary sites of infections caused by S. aureus are the skin and soft tissue; however, infection can become disseminated, causing bloodstream infection and multiple organ involvement including endocarditis. The point of entry of S. aureus maybe obvious such as folliculitis or maybe related to skin disruption which is not obvious. In addition, S. aureus can colonize devices following transcutaneous insertion producing a biofi lm on the device with subsequent potential for bloodstream infection and dissemination. The ingestion of food contaminated with S. aureus can cause food poisoning due to the presence of preformed enterotoxin.",

Three stages of HIV infection have been described. The initial stage of infection (primary infection), which occurs within weeks of acquiring the virus, is characterized by a fl u-or mono-like illness that is seen in about half of the patients and generally resolves within weeks. In this stage there is a rapid increase in plasma viremia, with high viral titers and widespread dissemination targeting lymphoid organs especially the GART. The patients are highly contagious in this stage. This phase is followed by a marked reduction in the virus to steady-state levels probably because of vigorous antivirus cellular responses. The immune response probably accounts for the mono-like or fl u-like acute retroviral syndrome. The second stage, a chronic asymptomatic infection lasts an average of 8-10 years. The third stage is the acquired immune defi ciency syndrome stage in which the patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections, cancers, severe weight loss, and dementia. The most common modes of infection are sexual transmission at the genital or colonic mucosa, exposure to other infected fl uids such as blood or blood products, transmission from mother to infant, and, occasionally, accidental occupational exposure. Due to rapid genetic changes in the virus, there is as yet no vaccine against this infection. Post exposure prophylaxis is used for occupational and nonoccupational exposure and most experts recommend three antiretroviral drugs for 4 weeks.",

During the acute phase, manifestations range from subclinical or anicteric hepatitis (70 %) to icteric hepatitis (30 %) and, in some cases, fulminant hepatitis (0.1-0.5 %). During the chronic phase, manifestations range from an asymptomatic carrier state to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. When symptomatic, a patient with acute infection may have anorexia, nausea, jaundice, and right upper quadrant discomfort that lasts from 1 to 3 months, and 5 % of adults will develop chronic disease compared to 90 % if infected at birth [ 35 ] . The method of acquiring HBV infection varies geographically. Perinatal transmission is most common in high prevalence areas such as the southeast Asia and China, while sexual contact and percutaneous transmission (e.g., intravenous drug use) are most common in the United States, Canada, and western Europe. Vaccination is highly effective (90 % effectiveness in immunocompetent) and it can be given safely to pregnant women. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all children receive their fi rst dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and complete the vaccine series by age 6-18 months. Older children and adolescents who did not previously receive the hepatitis B vaccine should also be vaccinated. After exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), whether it is occupational or nonoccupational, appropriate and timely prophylaxis can prevent HBV infection and subsequent development of chronic infection or liver disease. People who completed hepatitis B vaccine series and did not receive post-vaccination testing should receive a single booster vaccine dose, while unvaccinated persons should receive both hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after exposure (preferably within 24 h). The same approach is used for children born to infected mothers. Hepatitis B vaccine may be administered simultaneously with HBIG through a separate injection site.",

            "text": "Prions are small infectious pathogens containing protein but lack nucleic acid. Prion diseases are neurodegenerative diseases that have long incubation periods and progress rapidly once clinical symptoms appear. Five human prion diseases are currently recognized: kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), Gerstmann-Stra\u00fcssler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), one of a number of prion infections affecting animals, was responsible for bringing these agents to more widespread public attention because of its link to vCJD. Prion diseases appear to result from neurotoxic accumulation of abnormal isoforms of the prion protein. The gene encoding the prion protein in humans is located on the short arm of chromosome 20. A strong link was established between mutations in this gene and forms of prion disease with a familial predisposition (familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Stra\u00fcssler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia). The two diseases that are thought to be due to transmission of prions are kuru and vCJD. In kuru, symptoms begin with tremors, ataxia, and postural instability followed by loss of ambulation and involuntary movements. Dementia progresses in the late stages of the disease, with death typically occurring within 9-24 months from the onset. It is felt to be transmitted from person to person. Cannibalism which was common in New Guinea in the past could be the reason why it was endemic there. Now as this practice has been stopped, kuru has become rare. vCJD presents with a progressive course of cognitive decline with prominent neuropsychiatric features often accompanied by sensory symptoms and leads to death after an average of 14 months. Transmission to humans occurs through ingestion of infected bovine meat products. There is no person-to-person transmission, but it can occur during invasive medical interventions. One of the characteristic features of prions is their resistance to a number of usual decontaminating procedures. Private room and other measures are not required for infection control. But for surgical procedures on any person with confi rmed or suspected prion diseases, every effort should be made to plan carefully not only the procedure but also the infection prevention practices surrounding the procedure, e.g., instrument handling, storage, cleaning and decontamination, or disposal. Written protocols are essential.",

Malaria is the most important parasitic disease of humans, with transmission in over 100 countries affecting close to three billion people and causing one to two million deaths each year [ 36 ] . The initial symptoms and signs are nonspecifi c and may include tachycardia, tachypnea, chills, malaise, fatigue, diaphoresis, headache, cough, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Then periodic attacks of fever occur 48-72. Complications are due to severe anemia and capillary plugging from an adhesion of infected red blood cells with each other and endothelial lining of capillaries resulting in hypoxic injury to the brain and kidney. This occurs especially in P. falciparum infection where the parasitemia is more severe compared to the other species. Malaria is transmitted via the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito, which occurs mainly between dusk and dawn. Other comparatively rare mechanisms for transmission include congenitally acquired disease, blood transfusion, sharing of contaminated needles, and organ transplantation. In areas where malaria is endemic, the groups at high risk for severe malaria and its consequences include young children (6-36 months) and pregnant women. Older children and adults develop partial immunity after repeated infections and are at relatively low risk for severe disease. As disease incidence wanes, older age groups will become more susceptible due to decreasing immunity. Travelers to areas where malaria is endemic generally have no previous exposure to malaria parasites and are at very high risk for severe disease if infected. Modes of preventions include chemoprophylaxis and protection from mosquito bite by netting, protective clothing, and insect repellents which are also effective. Prompt diagnosis and treatment including \"self-treatment\" prevents complications.",

            "text": "Protozoa/diseaseKala-azar occurs in three distinct epidemiologic patterns: 1. In the Mediterranean basin and parts of China and Russia, the reservoir hosts are primarily dogs and foxes. 2. In sub-Saharan Africa, rats and small carnivores are believed to be the main reservoirs.3. In India and the neighboring countries (and Kenya), it is an anthroponosis (there is no other mammalian reservoir host other than human) Symptoms begin with intermittent fever, weakness, diarrhea, and chills and sweating that may resemble malaria symptoms early in the infection. The organisms proliferate and invade cells of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow causing hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and anemiaPrompt treatment of human infections and control of reservoir hosts Protection from sand fl ies by screening and insect repellents The vector is the sand fl y L. tropica complex, L. aethiopica/ old world cutaneous leishmaniasis L. tropica complex is present in many parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe The fi rst sign, a red papule, appears at the site of the fl y's bite. This lesion becomes irritated with intense itching then enlarges and ulcerates Prompt treatment and eradication of ulcers The urban form is thought to be an anthroponosis, while the rural form is zoonosis with human infections occurring only sporadically. The reservoir hosts are rodents Gradually the ulcer becomes hard and crusted and exudes a thin, serous material Control of sand fl ies and reservoir hosts L. aethiopica is endemic in Ethiopia and Kenya. The disease is a zoonosis with hyraxes serving as reservoir hosts The vector is the sand fl y Occurs in South and Central America, especially in the Amazon basin The types of lesions range from oriental sore to disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis Avoiding endemic areas Rodents, monkeys, raccoons, and domesticated dogs serve as reservoirs T. brucei gambiense is limited to tropical west and Central Africa Sleeping sickness starts with an ulcer at the site of the fl y bite. The disease progresses causing lethargy, tremors, and mental retardation. In the fi nal stage the patient develop convulsions, and hemiplegia prior to death Control of breeding sites of tsetse fl ies and use of insecticides An animal reservoir has not been proven for this infection Treatment of human cases T. brucei rhodesiense is found primarily in East Africa, especially the cattle-raising countries Avoiding insect bite by wearing protective clothing and using insect repellants Domestic animal hosts (cattle and sheep) and wild animals act as reservoir hosts The vector is the tsetse fl y Trypanosoma cruzi/ American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease) Found in South and Central America, wild animals are the reservoir hosts May be asymptomatic. One of the earliest signs is development of erythematous and indurated area at the site of the insect bite Insect control, eradication of nests The vector is the blood-sucking triatomine insects or kissing bugs Accompanied with fever, myalgia, and fatigue Infections are transmitted by the fecal-oral route; outbreaks are associated with contamination of water supplies with pig feces Extraintestinal invasion of organs is extremely rare in balantidiasis Person-to-person spread has been implicated The defi nitive host is the domestic cat and other felines. Humans and other mammals are intermediate hosts. T. gondii is usually acquired by ingestion. Transplacental transmission from an infected mother to the fetus can occur. Human-to-human transmission, other than transplacental transmission, does not occur After infecting the intestinal epithelium, the organisms spread to other organs especially the brain, lungs, liver, and eyes Cooking food to safe temperature and avoiding drinking untreated water. Pregnant or immunocompromised. Avoid changing cat litter or wear disposable gloves and wash hands afterwards Most primary infections in immunocompetent adults are asymptomatic. Encephalitis is the most common presentation of toxoplasmosis among AIDS patients. Congenital infection can result in abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal disease with encephalitis, chorioretinitis, and hepatosplenomegaly Cyclospora cayetanensis/ cyclosporiasis Infection occurs worldwide An intestinal protozoan that causes watery diarrhea in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. The diarrhea can be prolonged and relapsing in immunocompromised patients Avoiding food or water that may have been contaminated with feces It is acquired by fecal-oral transmission, especially via contaminated water supplies. There is no evidence for an animal reservoir Chlorine or iodine is unlikely to kill Cyclospora oocysts Isospora belli/ isosporiasis The organism is acquired by fecal-oral transmission of oocysts from either human or animal sources An intestinal protozoan that causes diarrhea, especially in AIDS patients Avoiding food or water that may have been contaminated with feces Chlorine or iodine is unlikely to kill Cyclospora oocysts Cryptosporidium parvum/ cryptosporidiosis The organism is acquired by fecal-oral transmission of oocysts from either human or animal sources The main symptom is diarrhea. It is most severe in AIDS patients Practicing good hygiene Water (drinking water and recreational water) is the most common method of transmission Avoid swimming if you are experiencing diarrhea and If infected, do not swim for at least 2 weeks after diarrhea stops Microsporidia/ microsporidiosis The organisms are transmitted by fecal-oral route. It is uncertain whether an animal reservoir exists Causes severe, persistent, watery diarrhea in AIDS patients Practicing good hygiene Trichomonas vaginalis / trichomoniasis This parasite has worldwide distribution, and sexual intercourse is the primary mode of transmission. Occasionally, infections can be transmitted by fomites (toilet articles and clothing) In women it can cause vaginitis with vaginal discharge and dysuria Both male and female sex partners must be treated to avoid reinfection Rarely infants may be infected by passage through the mother's infected birth canal In men it is mostly asymptomatic and very rarely may cause urethritis Good personal hygiene, avoidance of shared toilet articles and clothing Safe sexual practice",
