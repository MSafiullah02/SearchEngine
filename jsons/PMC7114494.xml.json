            "text": "In September 2012 the first case of a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection was reported (Zaki et al., 2012) and the etiological agent was named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (de Groot et al., 2013). As of 23 May 2014, 635 cases and 193 deaths have been confirmed (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_05_23_mers/en/). An investigation on 47 cases between September 2012 and June 2013 revealed that MERS patients display similar clinical features to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infection, but progress more rapidly towards respiratory failure (Assiri et al., 2013). In addition, a majority of MERS patients (estimated at 75%) has at least one co-morbid condition, in contrast to only 10\u201330% in SARS patients (Assiri et al., 2013, Drosten, 2013, Raj et al., 2014). Mortality rate in MERS-CoV-infected individuals is about 40%, compared to 10% during the SARS outbreak (http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_05_07a/en/). Human-to-human transmission has been reported, although it is still limited and inefficient (Raj et al., 2014). Although there are still no effective treatments, a mouse model suitable for studying MERS-CoV infection has been engineered (Zhao et al., 2014). The genomic sequence of MERS-CoV is closely related to bat CoVs HKU4 and HKU5, which belong to clade c of \u03b2-coronaviruses (Annan et al., 2013, Drexler et al., 2014). Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is thought to have crossed over from bats to humans, although MERS-CoV used camels as an intermediate species (Haagmans et al., 2014).",

The S protein is involved in host recognition and entry into the cell. Recently, the crystal structure of the fusion core (Gao et al., 2013) and the receptor binding domain (Chen et al., 2013) of MERS S protein have been solved. The M protein is the most abundant protein in the lipid envelope of virions and defines their shape (Barcena et al., 2009, Neuman et al., 2011), although high resolution structural data is still not available. The E protein is scarcely present in the virion, but abundantly expressed in the infected cell, mainly distributed in intracellular membranes between ER and Golgi compartments (Lim and Liu, 2001, Nal et al., 2005, Raamsman et al., 2000). In those sites, it participates in virus assembly, budding and intracellular trafficking. In the case of SARS-CoV, the E protein accumulates at the ERGIC (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011).",

The extramembrane C-terminal domain has some hydrophobic character, and could represent in some cases a second TM domain, e.g., in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) E proteins, although this has not been confirmed experimentally. SARS-CoV E protein has been shown unequivocally to have just one TM domain (Li et al., 2014), and is the only E protein for which structural data is available (Li et al., 2014, Pervushin et al., 2009). E proteins have been shown to form ion channels in synthetic membranes (Torres et al., 2007, Wilson et al., 2006), with reported conductance of 20\u201330 pS. However, characterization with properly purified full length and transmembrane peptides of SARS-CoV E protein has produced much higher (>10 times) conductances (Baguena et al., 2012, Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012, Verdia-Baguena et al., 2013a, Verdia-Baguena et al., 2013b). In SARS-CoV, this channel activity has been linked to activation of caspase-1 and maturation of pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 during infection (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014), although a detailed mechanism to explain this functional link is still not available.",

For example, deletion of E gene in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) results in blockage of virus trafficking in the cellular secretory pathway and prevention of virus maturation (Ortego et al., 2002). Mutations at the C-terminal region of MHV E protein results in impaired virion assembly and maturation (Fischer et al., 1998). SARS-CoV lacking the E gene is attenuated (DeDiego et al., 2007), and MERS-CoV lacking the E gene cannot propagate, despite showing similar viral RNA level to wild-type virus (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013). Based on the attenuating effect of E protein removal, a SARS-CoV lacking E gene is currently being studied as potential vaccine (Enjuanes et al., 2011, Fett et al., 2013, Netland et al., 2010), and a similar E-deletion approach has been suggested for controlling the MERS outbreak to obtain a virus that is replication-competent, but propagation-defective (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013).",

To test if MERS-CoV E protein also forms pentamers, Blue-native PAGE electrophoresis and sedimentation experiments were performed. When MERS-CoV E protein was solubilized in 5 mM DPC micelles (1:50 protein-to-detergent molar ratio) it migrated as a single band in a BN-PAGE gel (Fig. 3A). In common with other membrane proteins (Gan et al., 2011), the molecular weight of this band may not correspond to the molecular weight markers used, or to the AQPZ ladder (\u223c25 kDa for the monomer) possibly because of residual detergent bound to the protein. However, after dilution with 25 mM DPC, MERS-CoV E protein dissociated into lower molecular weight oligomers, from monomers to pentamers (Fig. 3A). This ladder conveniently provides an internal reference that serves as a oligomeric size marker. Therefore, by comparison with that ladder, we confidently assign the single band observed in 5 mM DPC to pentameric oligomers. The same oligomeric size was observed when using 50 mM DHPC and 20 mM LMPG (Fig. 3A, right panel), which are potentially good environments for structural characterization.",

The above results suggest that the introduced Cys-to-Ala mutations in the TM domain do not affect oligomer stability. Assuming that the mutual orientation between the TM helices is the same in all CoV E proteins, and therefore to that of SARS-CoV E protein (Pervushin et al., 2009, Torres et al., 2005, Torres et al., 2006), the orientation of the two TM cysteines in MERS-CoV E can be assumed to be near the helix\u2013helix interface (Fig. 3D). The TM helix\u2013helix orientation of coronavirus E proteins has been recently validated by in vivo data, where revertant mutants of SARS-CoV were obtained in mice after introducing a channel-inactivating mutation V25F in its E protein. This mutation was located at an interhelical position in our pentameric model, whereas the mutations that recovered channel activity were at positions 37, 30, 26, 27 and 19, all located at the helix\u2013helix interface and facing V25F (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). The two cysteines at the TM domain of MERS-CoV E are equivalent to positions 30 and 23 in the SARS-CoV E protein. Despite this putative inter-helical orientation, these Cys-to-Ala mutations did not seem to affect oligomer size or stability.",
