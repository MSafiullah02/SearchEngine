The first US cases appeared in California in mid-April 2009 (Ginsberg et al., 2009). Vaccine was rushed into production, and was available in October. In January 2010 the CDC declared vaccine had been successfully made available to targeted populations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). The H1N1 epidemic is of particular interest in academic emergency medicine. It is a time when the public health system, in which emergency departments (EDs) play a key role, should have been operating optimally due to heightened awareness of infection control efforts.",

Sensor data have been examined in comparison to electronic medical system log-in information in an ED setting to determine if the latter has utility in determining contacts (Gundlapalli et al., 2009). Other settings in which such technology has been used include schools (Stehle et al., 2011, Salathe et al., 2010) and scientific conferences (Isella et al., 2011b). Due to the costs associated with such technology, these investigations of contacts have been, with few exceptions, one-time investigations of short duration, e.g., 1 week or less. Such snapshots may not be representative of relationships throughout time, in particular failing to account for seasonal or even week-to-week variation. One study in high school students (Fournet and Barrat, 2014) for 11 days in two years showed that there was little variation in contact matrices by time of day, between days, and between years. However it is not clear how these results generalize to other populations. In general, the few studies involving longer periods of time report summary network measures for the period that do not permit inference to the general population of such networks. There is little information on contacts of patients as they interact with staff and with other patients. It is unknown if there are differences associated with patient age, sex, race, or clinical syndrome. There is also limited information about contacts of staff as they interact with other staff and with patients, particularly with respect to staff role (i.e., provider, nurse, administrative).",

Most staff members had observations in multiple shifts, another source of clustering, but addition of this random effect was found to be unnecessary to the models. Normal linear regression was used except for the following dependent variables: for number of weak components, Poisson regression was used; for indicators of radius >2 or not and diameter >5 or not, logistic regression was used. Regression diagnostic techniques confirmed linearity and lack of multicollinearity. Problematic residual distributions led to the use of bootstrapping (Carroll and Ruppert, 1988) to quantify sampling error, with 95% confidence intervals calculated utilizing 1000 bootstrapped estimates (based on bootstrapped samples of shifts). Before bootstrapping we screened for inclusion of 2-way interaction terms as appropriate: patient arrival mode with patient acuity, ED crowding during individual observation period, and chief complaint; patient acuity with percent population with high acuity, ED crowding during individual observation period, chief complaint, and day/night; day/night with percent population with high acuity and ED crowding during individual observation period; and patient age with chief complaint.

With respect to arrival mode, EMS patients have a more consistent geographic pathway of care while patients arriving by other modes are more ambulatory and therefore more easily moved between various waiting, evaluation and treatment areas (for example waiting room, triage, registration, imaging, treatment rooms). Patients arriving by EMS enter through the ambulance bay entry and are moved directly into a treatment room where traditional arrival activities occur (e.g., registration, triage, specimen collection, EKG, etc.). In contrast, for \u201cambulatory\u201d patients, traditional arrival activities occur in a variety of locations to which the patient moves as opposed to a single treatment room. Thus the increasing number of contacts that is associated with increased crowding does not affect EMS patients \u2013 as it does patients arriving by other modes \u2013 since they are effectively sequestered in a single room, leading to the observed statistical interaction.",

For SS relative degree, providers < nurses < other, which suggests that the non-clinical staff work within smaller spaces filled with other staff colleagues. We will be exploring this possibility further in a planned future analysis of the geography of contacts.",

They also indicate that these staff had 1762 interactions with patients. However, without the number of patients and the number of patient\u2013patient interactions we cannot describe the entire network and thus cannot compare our network to theirs. Isella et al.

The data presented here further emphasize the non-random mixing characteristics of the ED population. These results should help focus designers of emergency care on higher risk situations for the transmission of dangerous pathogens in an emergency department. In particular given the differential in contacts with EMS vs. non-EMS patients, it would appear that infection control efforts should consider non-EMS patients, particularly during times of ED crowding, as high priority targets for engineering or architectural interventions to artificially increase social distance with each other and with staff. Similar measures should also be directed at staff to increase their social distance from one another.",

We have observed repeated shifts while other studies have studied short fixed intervals at one fixed time. Our findings suggest that optimization of the geographic pathway of care is necessary, particularly for patients not arriving by EMS, in order to reduce the number of contacts with other patients, thus reducing cross infection risk. Such optimization might limit intradepartmental motion of patients and thus reduce the number of patient contact events. Therefore we need to examine movement patterns of EMS arrivals vs. other arrivals to verify our conjecture. We also need to better understand not only the geographic pathways of care but also the locations where PP interactions are occurring under crowded conditions (e.g., waiting room, transit areas like hallways) in order to find ways to reduce the number and duration of contacts taking place there. Social network analysis enabled characterization of the ED in a novel manner.
