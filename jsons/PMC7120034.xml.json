Lectins are defined as sugar-binding proteins that are neither antibodies nor enzymes [2]. According to Rudiger and Gabius (2001), a glycoprotein must meet three distinct requirements to qualify as a lectin. Firstly, a lectin is a protein/glycoprotein that binds carbohydrate(s). Secondly, lectins are not immunoglobulins (antibodies). Thirdly, lectins do not biochemically modify the carbohydrates which they bind [3].",

            "text": "Lectins were first discovered more than 100 years ago in plants, when in 1888, Stillmark found that extracts of castor bean (Ricinus communis) seeds contained a protein that could agglutinate animal red blood cells [4]. Following the discovery of Stillmark, a number of other plant seed extracts demonstrated the same ability to agglutinate red blood cells, but escalating interest in lectins was sparked during the Second World War as a result of the awareness of using lectins for blood typing. Because some lectins were found to be specific for various blood types (A, B or O), and others were found to have specificities for different glycans, lectins were used for blood typing before blood transfusions were performed [5, 6]. Lectins have since been found in almost every plant species studied and are particularly abundant in the seeds of leguminous plants. They have also been found in various tissues and organs of many vertebrates and invertebrates [7]. Due to their biochemical properties, lectins have become a beneficial tool in several fields of biological research including immunology [8], study of membrane structure, cell recognition [9], cancer research [10], and clinical microbiology [11]. 10.1007/978-94-007-6214-5_2 in this book provides more interesting stories regarding the history of lectinology.",

            "text": "Plant lectins can be categorized based on their overall mature structure into merolectins, hololectins, chimerolectins and superlectins (Fig. 5.1a). Firstly, merolectins are small monomeric lectins consisting exclusively of a single carbohydrate-binding domain. Due to their monovalent nature, they do not possess agglutinating activity, such as hevein isolated from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis [13]. Figure 5.1b shows the crystal structure of hevein with (4s)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Next are hololectins, also exclusively built up of carbohydrate-binding domains but containing at least two such domains that are either identical or very homologous and bind either the same or structurally similar sugar(s), and most plant lectins are included in this subgroup. One example is Concanavalin A which is a tetrameric protein and binds specifically \u03b1-d-mannosyl and \u03b1-d-glucosyl residues (two hexoses differing only by the alcohol on carbon 2). A refined structure of Concanavalin A with mannose at 2.0 angstroms resolution is shown in Fig. 5.1b [14]. Another example is peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin [15]. It is a 110-kDa, homotetrameric non-glycosylated protein (without RIP activity) and shows a specificity for the tumor-associated T-antigenic disaccharide Gal\u03b21,3GalNAc. The third group is chimerolectins, which are fusion proteins consisting of one or more carbohydrate-binding domain(s) tandemly arrayed to an unrelated domain. An example of this is ricin, which can be classified as both lectin and type II ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) [16]. As shown in Fig. 5.1b, ricin consists of two parts; an A chain (with N-glycosidase activity/RIP activity) and a B chain (hemagglutinating/lectin activity) with the B chain capable of binding different carbohydrates, such as \u03b2-d-glucose and \u03b2-d-galactose as shown in the figure. Lastly, superlectins are a type of chimerolectins which consist of at least two structurally different domains which recognize structurally unrelated carbohydrates [17]. For instance, TxLC-I is a superlectin isolated from tulip bulbs, and it consists of a mannose-binding domain and an unrelated GalNAc-binding domain. Since there is no crystal data on plant superlectin, the crystal structure of a superlectin purified from Burkholderia cepacia (a Gram-negative bacterium), named BC2L-A, is used for demonstration (Fig. 5.1b) [18]. The N-terminal domain of BC2L-A is a novel TNF-\u03b1-like fucose-binding lectin while the C-terminal is a calcium-dependent bacterial lectin.\n",

Other smaller families of plants whose lectins have been characterized are Gramineae (cereals, such as wheat germ) and Solanaceae (potatoes and tomatoes). Monocot-binding lectins exhibit an exclusive specificity towards mannose and are built up of 1, 2, 3, or 4 subunits of about 12 kDa while chitin-binding lectins are composed of hevein domains [20].

This specificity is usually determined by comparing sugars on the basis of the minimum concentration needed to inhibit hemagglutination.

            "text": "Because of their ability to distinguish carbohydrate determinants in human blood cells, lectins have historically been used for blood typing. Serology was the first discipline of medicine that relies on the specific biological activity of lectins [24]. Lectins agglutinate erythrocytes by binding to a carbohydrate-containing moiety on the surface of the cells and forming cross-bridges between them [4]. This useful property of lectins endows them the ability to discriminate between red blood cells that have different terminal, non-reducing sugars in the major glycoprotein that carries the blood group antigens [25]. For example, blood group A is determined by the presence of N-acetyl-galactosamine in the terminal, non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide portion of the receptor protein while group B is determined by galactose in this position. If both of these sugars are lacking, fucose is the terminal sugar and this determines blood group O. In this way, lectins with different specificities can be used in blood typing to differentiate between blood types. For readers seeking a comprehensive compilation of lectins that have been studied for blood group serology, the review by Judd (1980) is recommended [26].",

Mitogenic lectins mimic the action of antigens on lymphocytes, except that they activate a large proportion (as much as 70\u201380 %) of the cells, whereas antigens stimulate only specific clones, each of which compromise a tiny proportion, 0.1 % or less, of the total number of lymphocytes. Because of their ability to stimulate multiple lymphocyte clones, lectins are classified as polyclonal mitogens. One of the most valuable outcomes of this proliferative ability of lectins has been an increased understanding of the relationship between chromosomal abnormality and human diseases, which has tremendously helped in diagnosis [28]. Besides other cells, lymphocytes have been the usual target cells for mitogenic assays, and the study of lectin-lymphocyte interaction has made a significant contribution to elucidating the mechanism of lymphocyte activation and its control, further contributing to the understanding of cell growth and development.",

It has been suggested that mitogenic lectins interact with unique membrane components that may act as \u2018stimulating receptors\u2019, and that non-mitogenic lectins may not bind to these membrane components [28]. Mitogenic lectins are now tools for the study of signal transmission into cells and for the analysis of the biochemical events that occur during lymphocyte stimulation in vitro [36]. Such properties make them useful tools for the isolation and characterization of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, in cancer research, as diagnostic tools for the investigation of early cell-membrane alterations and carbohydrate changes that accompany neoplastic processes, and in immunological studies.",

It also induced apoptosis through both caspase-8/FLICE independent of a death receptor pathway and via a p53-independent pathway following ionizing radiation. Meanwhile, mistletoe lectin-II induced apoptotic death in cancer cells involving the generation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and activation of a caspase- 9-caspase-3 cascade [46].",

Mechanisms of plant lectin action elucidated thus far include preferential binding to cancer cell membranes or their receptors, causing cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor growth. Plant lectins can be internalized into cells, causing cancer cell agglutination and/or aggregation [54]. Ingested lectins can also sequester the available body pool of polyamines, in this manner they prevent cancer cell growth. The immune system is also affected by alterations in the production of various interleukins, or by activation of certain protein kinases. Additionally, lectins can bind to ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. They also alter the cell cycle by inducing non-apoptotic G1-phase accumulation mechanisms, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and can trigger the caspase cascade. Lectins can also down-regulate telomerase activity and inhibit angiogenesis [54].",

The antiviral activity of plant lectins can be based on several mechanisms. The surfaces of retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and many other enveloped viruses are covered by virally-encoded glycoproteins. Glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 present on the HIV envelope are heavily glycosylated, with glycans estimated to contribute almost 50 % of the molecular weight of gp120. Agents that specifically and strongly interact with the glycans may disturb interactions between the proteins of the viral envelope and the cells of the host [58]. Sugar-binding proteins can crosslink glycans on the viral surface and prevent further interactions with the co-receptors.",

The specificity of CV-N, however, is not limited only to different strains of HIV and related retroviruses. CV-N inhibited the development of viral cytopathic effects of Ebola virus, binding to its surface envelope glycoprotein [62] and also blocked influenza A and B strains by binding to the hemagglutinin surface glycoprotein [63]. The results of viral pretreatment studies indicated that CV-N directly neutralized both influenza A and B viruses, including both H1N1 and H3N2 strains. However, the CV-N resistant influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 was completely resistant to any direct neutralizing activity. Results suggested that CV-N bound directly to and inactivated the viral particle, preventing subsequent infection, and that both the likely molecular target for CV-N and the basis of CV-N resistance resided in the viral particle [63].",

Alternatively, it was stated that antifungal activity of some proteins or peptides is associated with chitin binding property and the active proteins should have a specific amino acid sequence and a cysteine/glycine rich chitin binding domain. This chitin binding property might simulate the carbohydrate binding property as chitin is composed of modified glucose subunits (N-acetyl glucose amine) which can be equally recognized by lectin as glucose [69].

The underlying principle behind lectin-mediated drug targeting is that most cell surface proteins and many lipids in cell membranes are glycosylated and these glycans can be the binding sites for lectins. The combination of a small number of sugars can produce a vast range of different chemical structures. Different cell types express different glycan arrays and diseased cells, such as transformed or cancerous cells, often express different glycans compared with their normal counterparts. Therefore, lectins could be used as carrier molecules to target drugs specifically to different cells and tissues [77]. By targeting cell types exclusively, the side effects of drugs could be minimized. Besides targeting specific cells, the lectin\u2013sugar interaction can also been used to trigger vesicular transport into or across epithelial cells. The concept of bio-adhesion via lectins may be applied not only for the gastrointestinal tract [76] but also for other biological barriers like the nasal mucosa, the lungs, the buccal cavity, the eye [78] and the blood\u2013brain barrier [77, 79]. Table 5.5 lists some examples of plant lectins from tomato [76], potato [78], wheat germ [79] and peanut [80] which have been studied to investigate their potential of use as drug targeting agents.\n",
