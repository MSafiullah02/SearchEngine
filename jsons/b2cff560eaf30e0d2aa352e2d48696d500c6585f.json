The responsible estimation of parameters is a main issue of mathematical pandemic models. Especially a good choice of \u03b2 as the number of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day) influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the actual COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University [3] to the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [2] (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown.",

The results are pessimistic in total with respect to a successful fight against the COVID-19-virus. Hopefully the reality is a bit more merciful than the mathematical model.
