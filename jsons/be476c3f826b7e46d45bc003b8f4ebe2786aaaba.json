Rush fulfilled this obligation by attending to patients with yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793, in part because he did not believe that yellow fever was a communicable disease. 6 Gregory and, especially, Percival influenced the 1847 Code of Ethics of the American Medical Association (AMA), the first national code of medical ethics in the history of the United States. The Code made this obligation explicit, listing it among \"the duties of the profession to the public.\" 7 Physicians should identify means to prevent epidemics and educate the public about such prevention. However, physicians' duties go further: \"when pestilence prevails, it is their duty to face the danger, and to continue their labors for the alleviation of suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives.\" 7(p333) The point for learners is that the ethical obligation to take reasonable risk to oneself is historically wellestablished and accepted. 8",

Medical educators should emphasize that the responsible management of scarce resources includes setting evidence-based and ethically justified priorities for access to diagnosis and treatment. 9,10 When such scarcity exists, the beneficence-based ethical obligation to minimize the risk to patients from the involvement of learners requires that learners no longer take part in the processes of patient care. It should be made very clear to learners that the reason for excluding them is to protect both learners and patients, as the AAMC guidance justifiably emphasizes. 11 Medical educators and academic leaders should continue to educate learners about and teach them professional formation in relation to COVID-19 even when direct clinical contact ends by ensuring that didactic teaching occurs. Medical educators should address what is known and what is not known about COVID-19 infection and its clinical management. It is typical early in the experience of new forms of disease for clinical judgment to be made with an incomplete fund of knowledge and clinical skill sets.
