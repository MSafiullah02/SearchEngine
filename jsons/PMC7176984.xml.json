Timely risk identification and designing an educational protocol regarding the widespread outbreak of the virus, and provision of proactive, timely, and effective public education should be considered as well. The widespread acceptance and rapid dissemination of messages generated in cyberspace and a high number of visitors reflect the effective and timely use of this space to solve these health problems. However, new educational technologies and applications and the capacity of national and private media should also be taken into account. Simple, functional, and free online courses should be available to everyone; user-friendly for the illiterate and disabled should also be considered. In addition, the comments by users and visitors on modifying and updating training messages increase the effectiveness of the training method. The educational content in different media formats can be developed and dedicated to the age of the target audience to enhance learning effectiveness. Training enhances the people\u2019s proper readiness and response to the virus; so, to manage the virus, policy-makers in the health system and all organizations involved should take steps in providing innovative, unified, and applied educational content to all people. It is also important and socially responsible for organizations and the people in these educational contexts to promote community resiliency.",
