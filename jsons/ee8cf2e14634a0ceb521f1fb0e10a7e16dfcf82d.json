This increase has been attributed to several contributing factors, the most prominent being the accelerated movements of humans and animals due to increased globalization and international trade, the climatic changes, and the larger and larger populations kept together in animal husbandry and breeding. Some of these diseases, termed transboundary animal diseases (TADs), such as foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever, have a high capacity to spread very rapidly over countries and borders, having a devastating impact on animal productivity and trade, as well as causing other losses in the animal husbandries and in wildlife. Other diseases, such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, and rabies, have more endemic character, establishing themselves in limited areas and showing slower tendency of spread. Considering their importance, many of these infectious diseases are listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as notifi able animal diseases, collectively referred to as OIE-listed diseases. The OIE is also determining and updating the international animal disease status on a regular basis. The current OIE-listed diseases and the latest disease status reports are available at the OIE website ( www.oie.int ).",

Direct detection and identifi cation means that the infectious agents and/or their components, such as nucleic acids or proteins, are detected in the collected samples. Commonly used classical diagnostic methods for direct detection include identifi cation of microorganisms by culture techniques and immunofl uorescence, and the most widely applied molecular diagnostic methods are the various assays of nucleic acid hybridization, e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal amplifi cation methods, such as the loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP), among others. When running indirect diagnosis and identifi cation , the immune responses of the host are investigated, looking for antibodies against various infectious agents, which indicate the occurrence of the infections in the hosts.

The main reasons are that a unique signature of every microorganism is encoded in its genome, which in principle enables perfect specifi city, and that various enzymatic mechanisms can be utilized to manipulate and amplify the genetic material, yielding an exquisite sensitivity of the molecular DNA-based assays. While bacteria have their genome encoded in the form of DNA, some viral genomes are composed of RNA, and an initial reverse transcription step is therefore required before further manipulations and amplifi cation can be carried out. Enzymes typically utilized are polymerases, reverse transcriptases, ligases, glycosylases, and nucleases. Of these, the polymerases require a pair of sequence-specifi c primers, which enables selective target amplifi cation. PCR employs thermostable polymerases to enable amplifi cation by continuous thermocycling and is currently the most commonly used method for amplifi cation of genetic material [ 3 ] . The highly charged phosphodiester backbone of DNA makes the PCR product amenable to high-resolution visualization on agarose gel electrophoresis utilizing DNA-binding fl uorescent dyes such as ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis both provides a means for detection by band visualization and enables at least a tentative verifi cation of specifi city by estimation of the amplicon length.",

The greater sensitivity has been attributed to both a dilution effect of any inhibitory compounds present in the sample, since only a minor fraction of the fi rst reaction volume is used in the second reaction, and the fact that the primer-driven reaction is run twice, using four specifi c primers, rather than two. An intermediate situation is obtained if one of the primers from the fi rst reaction is retained in the second, which yields a semi-nested PCR format.",

Furthermore, it only refl ects the end point of the PCR and, for this reason, doesn't allow the determination of the initial quantity of the detected material, e.g., determination of the viral load. Since it lacks specifi c markers for the targeted amplicon, unspecifi c amplifi cation yielding similar product sizes may lead to false positive detection. Nested PCR has the further disadvantage of being prone to cross-contaminations since reaction tubes with potentially very high quantities of target DNA are opened between the two reactions. Many of these drawbacks were solved by the advent of real-time PCR [ 6 ] . With this technique, the PCR product is monitored in the course of the reaction using DNA-binding moieties that alter their fl uorescence upon binding to the amplifi ed DNA. This allows a closed tube, homogeneous assay format, which reduces the risk for cross-contamination and also removes the laborious gel electrophoresis step. In addition, the cycle number where the fl uorescence reaches a defi ned threshold level will depend on the initial quantity of target DNA or RNA (before reverse transcription).",

The simplest method is to add a fl uorescent dye to the PCR mixture with the property that the fl uorescence intensity changes upon DNA binding. Typical dyes are asymmetric cyanine dyes, such as SYBR green or tiazole orange, that exhibit a fl uorescence increase when bound to DNA [ 7 , 8 ] . These types of realtime PCR have no better specifi city than gel-based PCR, rather the opposite, since no information is provided about the product length. New possibilities are given by tethering the dye to one of the PCR primers that are constructed so that incorporation of the primer into the amplicon leads to an alteration of dye fl uorescence. Several chemistries have been devised to this end, for example, scorpion primers [ 9 ], LUX primers [ 10 ], and Plexor primers [ 11 ] . Although in principle not providing a better specifi city in regard to spurious amplifi cation than the pure dye approach, fl uorescent primers enable multiplexing by co-adding several primer pairs, each with a distinct fl uorophore. The third approach includes addition of a third fl uorescently labeled oligonucleotide, located between the primers, called a probe. The probe can also be labeled with a quencher (dual-labeled probe) but not always, e.g., not for the LightUp probes [ 7 ] or in the PriProET approach [ 12 , 13 ] . Prominent examples of methods based on dual-labeled probes include TaqMan [ 14 ] and molecular beacons [ 15 ] .",

This is achieved by manipulating primer properties, most critically concentration, as well as other factors infl uencing primer melting temperature, such as length and nucleotide sequence. In the LATE-PCR method [ 16 ] , asymmetric PCR has been combined with molecular beacons for readout to achieve a detection format that allows quantifi cation from the end-point fl uorescence.

This technique employs a three level semi-nested PCR format that utilize Plexor [ 11 ] fl uorogenic primers as a detection mechanism. Furthermore, the assay format allows a highly multiplex interrogation of the sample by using primers in two vastly different concentration regimes. Instead of, as hitherto has been the case, requiring nucleotide sequencing over the hemagglutinin and fusion protein genes of avian infl uenza and Newcastle disease viruses, a much faster diagnosis can be obtained by a simple PCR-based method. This method could even be implemented on fi eld PCR instruments for rapid on-site diagnosis and thereby providing means for faster containment of disease outbreaks.",

Addition of loop primers may accelerate the reaction [ 26 ] . As of 8 February 2014, PubMed listed 990 publications with the search term \"loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation.\" LAMP technology has been applied for the detection of viral pathogens such as classical swine fever virus [ 27 ] and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [ 28 ] , bacteria such as Clostridium diffi cile [ 29 ] , and parasites such as malaria [ 30 ] .

            "text": "Genomic partitioning refers to the methodologies used for capture and enrichment of target regions. Within these methodologies, PLP has been used repeatedly for genotyping, localization, and array-based diagnostics. The earliest version of PLP consisted of two oligonucleotide probes of 20 nt connected by a linker region of 40 nt [ 33 ] . As the probes hybridize towards the target, the construct is ligated into a circular detector that can be replicated isothermally by Phi29 polymerase [ 40 ] . The detection can then be performed through incorporation of fl uorophore tagged nucleotides. The PLP concept was further expanded with the introduction of the molecular inversion probe (MIP) technology. Where PLP leaves no gap after hybridization to the target region, MIP aims at leaving a single nucleotide gap. This gap is then fi lled in by addition of a single type of nucleotide into the assay. This approach enables substitutions on nucleotide level to be detected using just four reactions easily set up in a normal lab environment. It also provides a possibility of highly multiplexed designs of assays [ 41 , 42 ] . Building on the same principle as PLP and MIP, the connector inversion probe (CIPer) technology extends the gap up to a few hundred nucleotides. Using DNA polymerase to fi ll the gap generates a product that can be sequenced, revealing the content of the target region [ 43 ] . Applications of PLP methodology and its derivatives for infectious diseases in animals include detection of all hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes of AIV [ 44 ] , as well as multiplex detection of FMDV, swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [ 45 ] . In addition, by designing different probes for the genomic and replicative form of the virus, it is possible to not only detect a virus but also localize it in relation to the host cells and perform semiquantitative analysis of the amount of replicative viruses, as demonstrated with porcine circovirus type 2 [ 46 ] .",

However, regardless of amplifi cation method, it is fi rst necessary to concentrate and lyse the sample material to extract and purify the nucleic acid. As described in the review by Heo et al. [ 57 ] , a variety of alternative solutions have been developed to perform these sequential steps on a microfl uidic chip. Popular strategies for sample concentration include magnetic beads [ 58 ] and dielectrophoresis [ 59 ] . The lysis of enriched samples can then be achieved by various methods, such as thermal energy, optothermal energy, mechanical force, and chemicals [ 60 ] . For the purifi cation of extracted nucleic acid, packed silica beads, microfabricated structures, and magnetic beads have all proved to be useful solutions [ 61 ] . After amplifi cation, the detection of products is most commonly performed with fl uorescence or electrochemical methods, which easily can be miniaturized. A classifi cation into three categories was suggested for microfl uidic chips that use amplifi cation-based detection by Mairhofer et al. [ 52 ] . These categories included microfl uidic chips with (1) a stationary chamber as nano-/picoliter reservoir for conventional thermocycling, (2) a continuous fl ow where the sample is moved between individual temperature zones at different locations for cycling, and (3) a droplet-based system where each amplicon is individually amplifi ed within a water-in-oil droplet. Examples of fully implemented amplifi cation-based systems include devices for detection of different viruses, such as dengue virus and enteroviruses [ 62 ] , as well as various bacteria, most notably Bacillus anthracis [ 63 , 64 ] .",

Among them, PCR has been the most commonly used technology. When considering the development of new technologies, a general trend can be observed towards robust and affordable automatic systems that also integrate sample preparation steps for rapid and highly sensitive multiplex detection of an easily enlarged panel of pathogens, both bacterial and viral. Although few, if any, of the novel systems have successfully incorporated all of these properties, they still represent important technological advancements towards more sensitive and effi cient detection. Even so, only a limited number have so far been developed into commercial diagnostic kits, and only a few molecular tests are offered by veterinary diagnostic laboratories. The full potential and impact of molecular diagnosis is therefore yet to be realized. A possible explanation may be that most new published assays are only analytical validated and not properly evaluated in accordance with the appropriate criteria for fi eld validation. New molecular tests might also not comply with current accreditation standards.",

A \"PCR positive result\" by itself, without analyzing the complex scenario, can be unreliable, even misleading, and may cause serious problems for the veterinary and human medical health authorities during implementation of eradication programs. To avoid such problems and to provide a reliable diagnosis, it is important to obtain a complete medical understanding of the disease scenario. Reliable diagnoses can be reached, of course, even on the basis of single PCR assays, if they are raising the right questions and the results are professionally communicated. On the other hand, there are many cases of infectious diseases where the diagnosis is more reliable if a range of various methods, both direct and indirect approaches, are applied simultaneously. It should therefore be emphasized that in certain cases, the simultaneous application of novel molecular diagnostic methods and classical approaches, such as isolation by culturing, is required for a fully reliable diagnosis.",
