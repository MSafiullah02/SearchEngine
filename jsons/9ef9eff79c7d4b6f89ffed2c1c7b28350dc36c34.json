Here, we investigated the potential extent of T cell cross-reactivity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can be conferred by other coronaviruses and influenza virus, and generated a map of public and private predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes between coronaviruses. Moreover, to assess the potential risk of self-reactivity and/or diminished T cell response for peptides identical or highly similar to the host, we identified predicted epitopes with high sequence similarity with human proteome. Lastly, we compared predicted epitopes from coronaviruses with epitopes from influenza virus deposited in IEDB to support vaccine development against different virus strains. We believe the comprehensive in silico profile of private and public predicted epitopes across coronaviruses and influenza viruses will facilitate design of vaccines capable of protecting against various viral infections.",

We also expanded the map of cross-reactivity from exact matching peptides to those with a high sequence similarity, resulting in addition of 264 and 283 public SARS-CoV-2 predicted epitopes by allowing one and two amino acid mismatches, respectively. Moreover, to assess the risk of self-reactivity and immunopathology, we compared SARS-CoV-2 predicted epitopes with human proteome sequences and detected ten predicted epitopes that are single amino acid variant from their counterparts in the human proteome.

Based on sequence alignments (example alignment of spike protein illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1 ) and phylogenetic trees of encoded proteins, the alpha and betacoronavirus strains shared a high sequence similarity within their own genera, i.e. higher similarity between NL63 and 229E than with betacoronaviruses. In particular, for betacoronavirus strains, phylogenetic analysis showed higher similarity between OC43 and HKU1, and between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Notably, MERS-CoV showed relatively distinct proteome sequences to all other coronavirus strains included in this study ( Figure 1A for spike protein and Supplementary Figure 2 for other encoded proteins).",

Of interest, there were few peptides predicted to bind by at least 7 different HLA alleles, of which 9 peptides were derived from SARS-CoV-2.
