            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is considered one of the major poultry pathogens, being probably endemic in all regions with intensive poultry production (Office, 2004). It is primarily a respiratory pathogen of domestic fowl, although strains can vary in pathogenicity and tissue tropism (Jones and Ambali, 1987, Jones and Jordan, 1970, Winterfield and Hitchner, 1962). IBV is a Group 3 member in the genus Coronavirus (Gonzalez et al., 2003) and its genome consists of a 27 Kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule that encodes for four structural proteins. The nucleoprotein (N) is associated with viral genome to form the nucleocapsid, whereas the remaining structural proteins, the spike (S), small membrane (M), and envelope proteins (E), are inserted in the envelope surrounding the nucleocapsid. In addition, the genome also encodes for the replicase complex responsible for carrying out the unique discontinuous transcription process that leads to the generation of a nested set of six 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (Stern and Kennedy, 1980, Stern and Sefton, 1982).",

            "text": "The continuous emergence of new IBV serotypes has complicated the design of appropriate control programs due to the antigenic variation and the low degree of cross protection observed among IBV serotypes and has pointed out the necessity for accurate techniques to diagnose and classify this viral agent (Cowen and Hitchner, 1975). Nucleotide sequencing and subsequent genetic analysis of the S1 protein gene sequences provides a fast and accurate method to classify and predict IBV serotype, but also a powerful instrument to monitor phylogenetic and epidemiological evolution of IBV subtypes (Adzhar et al., 1997, Cavanagh and Davis, 1986, Cavanagh et al., 1992b, Cavanagh et al., 1986, Kant et al., 1992, Koch et al., 1990, Lee and Jackwood, 2001, Liu et al., 2006, Mase et al., 2004, Moore et al., 1998, Wang and Huang, 2000). Mutation and recombination processes have been demonstrated to be involved in the genetic variation, and therefore in the evolution of IBV, leading to the emergence of new variant strains and giving rise to virus population diversity (Cavanagh et al., 1992a, Kottier et al., 1995, Lee and Jackwood, 2000, Wang et al., 1997). However, very distinct spatiotemporal and epidemiological behaviours are shown among these new strains. Whereas some emergent viruses rapidly spread to other geographic areas and become established, as happened with the 4/91 serotype in Europe or the Georgia serotype in North America, others remain restricted to the region of origin. More interestingly, hardly ever genotypes are exchanged among different continents (Kusters et al., 1987, Zanella et al., 2003). Nevertheless, factors that determine distinct spreading and fitness abilities of the new emergent strains are poorly understood. Hence, monitoring IBV subpopulation dynamics in a specific region over time may reveal molecular features that contributed to the different fitting and spreading abilities of IBV strains.",

In 2002, an epidemiological survey among the most important Spanish poultry companies pointed out IB as one of the main infectious diseases affecting farms and revealed the necessity of an in-depth study to determine the epidemiological situation and to improve the efficacy of vaccination and control programs against the disease. Furthermore, the availability of IBV strains isolated in Spain during the past 14 years provided a unique opportunity for a detailed genetic study to determine not only the prevalent IBV genotypes in our country but also the dynamics of viral subpopulation which is necessary for a deeply understanding of IBV evolution and epidemiology.",

Furthermore, several methods were implemented to identify putative recombination events among these isolates and establish the extent of recombination into IBV evolution.

The present study shows 4/91 as one of the most predominant genotypes also in Spain and demonstrates it has been circulating in our country since 1992. Previous studies of the degree of variation exhibited within the S1 gene sequences of 4/91 serotype isolates reported maximum nucleotide and amino acid differences of 4% and 8% respectively (Cavanagh et al., 2005). In the present investigation, 4/91 Spanish isolates showed higher genetic divergences among them, and more interestingly they were split in two major phylogenetic clusters, suggesting that 4/91 genotype has gone through evident evolutive changes during these years in our country. Furthermore, cross VN results carried out with a field 4/91 Spanish isolate demonstrates that these unique evolutive processes contributed to greatly decrease the antigenic relatedness between the 4/91 Spanish field strains and the reference 4/91 serotype. Hence, these findings suggest that antigenic subtypes may be present in field and in the brink of arising as a new serotype, regardless of the level of genetic variation displayed.",

Although a very rapid evolutive rate from a common ancestor might have lead to a similar situation, no cumulative changes were observed among Spanish 4/91 isolates and unique amino acidic changes observed in one of these two groups were not shared by the other. Moreover, the average dS/dN ratio for the whole S1 gene was not suggestive of a high evolutive rate. Therefore, one possible explanation for this scenario would be that 4/91 strains isolated in Spain evolved from at least two distinct evolutive lineages probably originated in two different ancestors. Taking into account that both isolates assigned to Spanish 4/91 cluster 2 are the more recently isolated, a new reintroduction of 4/91 isolates in our country could be hypothesized as has been previously suspected in other countries (Adzhar et al., 1997). On the other hand, based on the results of recombination analyses carried out in this study, the possibility that recombination processes might have been involved in the rapid evolution of the Spanish 4/91 cluster 2 giving rise to a new lineage cannot be excluded.",

Whereas 4/91 was the predominant genotype in Spain in the nineties, the situation took a turn at the end of that decade when the new Italy 02 genotype appeared and displaced the previous predominant genotype. High sequence divergences and the presence of cumulative changes observed within Spanish Italy 02 isolates further support a fast evolutionary rate of this serotype in our country. A wide variety of causes could have been driving the observed virus subpopulation replacement. However, we found strong evidences of the positive selection of mutations within the S1 epitope regions of Italy 02 isolates which suggest a selection pressure-driven evolution of this genotype in Spain. Evidently, some cautionary remarks should be considered as our analyses were only focused on the S1 protein gene, but selection pressures could have occurred in other regions within IBV genome. Therefore, to accurately discern the evolutionary history of this genotypic shift, whole genome studies should be carried out.",

Our data suggests positive selected mutations of Italy 02 might have lead these new isolates escaping the immune system. Evidences of positive selection pressures acting over specific residues within antigenic sites have been previously reported for other viruses against which partial cross protection is induced after infection or vaccination, similarly to what happens with IBV (Grenfell et al., 2004, Haydon et al., 2001, Hurst, 2002). In this sense, it is noteworthy that at the late nineties, commercial vaccines against the 4/91 became available in Spain. Therefore, it is likely that vaccination implemented against 4/91 serotype was very successful in order to achieve an effective control of infections caused by this serotype in our country, based on the drastic reduction of 4/91 isolations from clinical cases. But on the other hand, it is tempting to speculate that the high immune pressure against 4/91 isolates might have provided an environment in which the novel variant genotype Italy 02 had higher fitness advantage contributing to a faster establishment and spreading of this serotype in Spain.",

Interestingly, most of the recombinant breakpoints identified among Spanish IBV field isolates were clustered in restricted regions within the 5\u2032 half part of the S1 gene and involved Italy 02 isolates, suggesting the presence of sequence or structure motifs that could act as specific \u201chotspots\u201d.

Epidemiological information of these isolates is summarized in Table 1\n. All field viruses were isolated in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs, acquired from Charles Rivers Spafas (North Franklin, USA). Two commercial vaccines currently licensed for use in Spain, IB 4/91 and IB MA5, were also included in the study. The reference IBV serotypes M41, D274, D1466 and 4/91 and antisera against them to be used in the virus neutralization (VN) assay were purchased from the Animal Health Center (Deventer, The Netherlands). The Spanish field virus Spain/00/337, also used in the VN assay, had been previously isolated and characterized as belonging to the Italy 02 serotype in our laboratory (Dolz et al., 2006). To obtain virus stocks for VN assays, allantoic fluid from field isolates Spain/99/319 and Spain/99/325 and reference strains was harvested, frozen at \u2212 80 C and then titrated in SPF chicken embryos. Endpoint dilutions and titres were determined by the Reed and Muench method (Villegas, 1998). Monospecific antisera against field isolates were obtained following the procedure previously described (Dolz et al., 2006, Gelb and Jackwood, 1998).",

Only Spanish field isolates were included in the study because the objective was to investigate the extent of recombination events in field. All field Spanish isolates were aligned using ClustalW program implemented in BioEdit v7.0.5 package. Then, six methods implemented in the RDP v2.0 software package, including RDP, Bootscan, GENECONV, Maxchi, Chimaera and SiScan were employed to identify recombinant breakpoints (Gibbs et al., 2000, Padidam et al., 1999, Posada, 2002, Salminen et al., 1995). General settings used for all methods were as follows: window size = 20, highest acceptable P value = 0.001 and Bonferroni correction. Only recombination breakpoints detected by more than three methods were considered. Also, once potential recombination events were identified, sequence alignment was split at that point and phylogenetic analysis of the two regions was performed to evaluate conflicting evolutionary histories of both regions. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using a maximum parsimony method with 1000 bootstraps (Kumar et al., 2004). Same methods and software have been previously used in recombination studies with SARS (Zhang et al., 2005).",
