The incorporation of Stig resulted in the largest fraction of multilamellar\nstructures and a distinctive phase transition pattern. Camp LNPs showed a thermal pattern\nsimilar to Chol yet possessed a much larger degree of multilamellarity and, potentially, the\ninverted-hexagonal phase at a physiological temperature. Fuco, the only phytosterol in the\nseries containing a double bond in the alkyl chain, likely induces an entirely different\nlipid ordering due to the lipid separation, as evident from both the distinct fraction of\ninternal defects and the thermal pattern. Despite the subtle variations in the chemical\nstructures of these phytosterols, they greatly affect the lipid packing in LNP formulations.\nOverall, we can propose that an increase in multilamellarity and polymorphic shape results\nin higher gene transfection, although future studies are needed to identify the lipid phases\nand their effect on gene delivery.",
