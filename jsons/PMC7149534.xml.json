Additional reports include one incident in farmed ferrets, and a single captive river otter. However, it is likely that this condition could affect any member of the taxa under the right conditions. The pathogenesis of thiamine deficiency is complex, and likely related to its role as a critical cofactor for production of pyruvate decarboxylase and transketolase, with lesion distribution closely paralleling transketolase activity in the brain. The decreased activity of ATP-dependent sodium and water transport results in the intraneuronal swelling progressing to neuronal necrosis as well as vascular degeneration, edema, and hemorrhage. The gross lesions of thiamine deficiency are similar to those in other carnivores and consist of bilaterally symmetrical hemorrhage and necrosis of the periventricular gray matter, caudal colliculi, and vestibular nuclei. Histologically, vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of neurons (with accompanying gliosis) is most easily seen in nuclei within the lateral geniculate bodies, caudal colliculi, and red nuclei. In one report, lesions were present only in adult male mink but not in adult females or kits (Okada et al., 1987). Cardiac lesions, which occur in the dog and fox, have not been described in mink.",

            "text": "\nVitamin E deficiency was first described in farmed mink in the 1940s with intermittent reports in other mustelids (Gorham and Griffiths, 1956). This disease primarily affects healthy young farmed mink in the summer and fall, and may present with no premonitory signs (Gorham and Griffiths, 1956). As an important antioxidant, vitamin E protects cellular membranes against oxidative processes initiated by free radicals, hypovitaminosis E has been associated with diets containing high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (improperly stored fish can contain highly unsaturated fish oils). Affected mustelids suffer from steatitis, and skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration. Mink can also develop microcytic, normochromic anemia (Stowe and Whitehair, 1963). Gross lesions justify the early name associated with this condition, \u201cyellow fat disease.\u201d At necropsy, the abdominal skin appears thickened and doughy, and may exude thin, watery fluid (Ford, 1961). Oxidized abdominal and subcutaneous fat is hardened and yellow-brown, and a fishy odor may permeate the cadaver in severe cases. Histologic lesions include widespread adipocyte necrosis with multifocal saponification, dystrophic mineralization, and mixed suppurative and histiocytic inflammation (Fig. 11.1\n). In severe cases, entire lobules may be replaced by inflammatory cells whose cytoplasm contains acid-fast positive ceroid pigment. Skeletal and cardiac muscle may exhibit varying degrees of myofiber degeneration, swelling, cytoplasmic vacuolation, fragmentation, contraction band necrosis, and fibrosis, with proliferation of satellite nuclei.",

In affected animals, gastric lesions are grossly visible and are often concentrated in the pyloric mucosa, with an adherent surface coating of dark brown to black, partially digested blood (Fig. 11.2\n). Histologically, these lesions in sea otters are typically erosions not ulcers and they are characterized by wedge-shaped areas of mucosal coagulation necrosis and hemorrhage, sometimes with one or more tiny fibrin thrombi in subtending blood vessels. When present in the gastric body, these lesions often concentrate along the tips of the rugal folds. In ferrets, ulcers are often concentrated in the pylorus and may result in full thickness ulceration and significant, often fatal bleeds. In all affected mustelids, while rarely serving as a primary cause of death, gastric erosions/ulcers often contribute to morbidity and mortality through progressive, severe blood loss, and less commonly, acute submucosal vascular rupture. A causal relationship has been proposed for the development of gastric inflammation and erosions/ulcers in older ferrets and sea otters with confirmed Helicobacter mustelae and H. enhydrae infection, respectively; however, a direct causal link has not been established (Fox et al., 1990, Shen et al., 2017).",

            "text": "\nAdrenal-associated endocrinopathy (AAE) is a very common metabolic condition in middle aged and older ferrets. In intact ferrets, seasonal secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus results in secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland, which prepares the ovary and testis for reproduction. The routine practice of early castration or ovariohysterectomy causes chronic luteinizing hormone secretion due to loss of negative gonadal feedback, resulting in hyperplastic and potentially neoplastic proliferation of primitive adrenocortical cells in the juxtamedullary region (Bielinska et al., 2006). Proliferative adrenocortical lesions may be observed in animals less than 1 year of age, and range from multiple hyperplastic nodules to infiltrative carcinoma. Corroborative clinical signs include various patterns of truncal alopecia due to the inhibitory effects of excess estrogen secretion on hair follicles, vulvar swelling in spayed females, and a return to sexual behavior in neutered animals of either sex. Aberrant adrenocortical tissue may secrete estrogen, testosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, or other intermediate metabolites; serum tests for these compounds, especially in neutered animals, establish the diagnosis. Excessive cortisol levels are only rarely encountered in ferrets with this condition, so use of the term \u201cCushing\u2019s disease\u201d is inappropriate. Precise classification of these tumors is not always possible or necessary; with the exception of a myxoid variant of carcinoma, tumor metastasis is uncommon, and occurs late in disease progression (Peterson et al., 2003). Adrenocortical nodular hyperplasia is also very common in sea otters and appears to be age-related; however, no associated clinical signs or clinical pathology have been reported.",

In farmed mink, struvite urolithiasis displays clear seasonal patterns, with pregnant females affected in the spring, and male kits affected in the fall. In the gravid female, stones may hinder parturition, resulting in dystocia and death, while in males; urethral obstruction may result from urolith-mediated blockage at the distal os penis (Gorham and Griffiths, 1956). Concurrent urinary tract infection with Staphylococcus intermedius is common in affected animals. In a review of 408 uroliths from pet ferrets, 202 (67%) uroliths were struvite, 61 (15%) were cystine, and 43 (11%) were calcium oxalate. Uroliths were detected more commonly in males (73%), prevalence increased with age, and most (77%) uroliths were retrieved from the bladder.

This syndrome first appears in ferrets that are \u22656 months, with increasing prevalence in geriatric animals. Both dilatative and hypertrophic forms have been identified in ferrets, but dilative disease is more common. Thoracic and abdominal effusion may be present, and histological lesions include myofiber loss and fibrosis. Mild lesions are often first identified in ventricular perivascular regions and the interventricular septum. The extent of fibrosis on histopathology may not correspond with the severity of clinical signs. In southern sea otters, cardiomyopathy was identified as the third most common primary cause of death in one review of mortality patterns in free-ranging animals (Kreuder et al., 2005). In contrast, this condition is uncommon in Alaskan sea otters. Grossly, affected animals exhibit variably dilated, orange/white-mottled myocardium, often with evidence of left and/or right heart failure (Fig. 11.5\n). Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is presumed to be the end stage of this chronic condition in animals that have survived for longer periods. However, as with ferrets, the extent of myocardial dilation, inflammation, and fibrosis may not always correspond with the severity of clinical diseases. On histopathology, sea otter cardiomyopathy is characterized by mild to severe lymphocytic to pleocellular myocarditis with progressive myofiber loss and replacement fibrosis. In a prior epidemiological study, exposure to Sarcocystis neurona and DA were significant risk factors for myocarditis in sea otters, but only DA exposure was a risk factor for DCM (Kreuder et al., 2005). The lesions associated with sea otter cardiomyopathy are similar to DA-associated cardiac disease of California sea lions (See Chapter 23).",

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is associated with systemic hypereosinophilia, and inflammatory damage to the gastrointestinal tract, abdomen, and thoracic cavity. Eosinophil aggregates within lymph nodes and various organs may produce Splendore-Hoeppli material, and abundant eosinophils are apparent in the vasculature of affected animals.

Clinical signs in mustelids often progress faster than in dogs, with ferret-adapted strains causing death in as little as 12 days. Microscopic lesions include bronchointerstitial pneumonia, alveolar syncytia, mild to moderate meningoencephalitis, and variable numbers of intracytoplasmic and intranuclear, eosinophilic viral inclusions in epithelial and syncytial cells as well as neurons and glial cells. Due to the rapid disease course, sick animals may be seronegative for CDV (Mos et al., 2003, Williams et al., 1988). CDV immunohistochemistry and PCR are available in most of the diagnostic laboratories. Concurrent infections are common secondary to CDV-associated immunosuppression (Kubiski et al., 2016).

In many parts of the world, mustelids serve as important reservoirs for host-adapted rabies viral strains, especially striped skunks in the United States, and ferret badgers in Southeast Asia (Chang et al., 2015). Based on anecdotal reports, river otters are commonly rabies-positive in some eastern US state rabies monitoring programs. However, many of these cases are not reported in the peer-reviewed literature, which leads to the misperception of rabies being uncommon in the species. In most cases, affected animals were described as unusually aggressive or tame, and often bit or approached humans prior to euthanasia and rabies testing. In one report from Massachusetts (US), 3 of 8 river otters submitted for testing were rabies-positive, while a published review of historical cases revealed 24 confirmed cases in US river otters from 1971 to 1994. Rabies was also diagnosed in a river otter intended for a reintroduction program, illustrating the importance of pathogen screening in wildlife transportation and release programs (Serfass et al., 1995). Vaccination has dramatically reduced case prevalence in zoos; any unexpected behavioral signs or sudden death, especially in unvaccinated animals, necessitates consideration of rabies, in part due to significant human health risk.",

Ferrets are susceptible to both Type A and B influenza stains, and are commonly used as models for influenza research (Zitzow et al., 2002). Free-ranging striped skunks and ranched mink have been implicated as potential conduits for influenza viral amplification and spread from infected humans and other animals. Based on the necropsy findings and experimental infection, both groups may shed influenza virus for extended periods, facilitating transmission (Britton et al., 2010, Englund et al., 1986, Root et al., 2014). Clinical signs of influenza in mustelids are similar to humans: malaise, serous nasal discharge, and lower respiratory tract disease due to viral infection and/or secondary, opportunistic bacterial infections. In free-ranging skunks infected with highly pathogenic H1N1 influenza virus, lesions and clinical signs included purulent nasal exudate, splenomegaly and severe pneumonia characterized by heavy, dark red to purple lungs. Microscopic examination revealed moderate rhinitis and severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia (Britton et al., 2010). Influenza A encephalitis has also been reported in a stone martin that had diffuse nonsuppsurative panencephalitis with perivascular cuffing, multifocal gliosis, neuronal necrosis, and focal necrosis of pancreatic islet cells (Klopfleisch et al., 2007). Both northern and southern sea otters have been reported as seropositive for influenza A infection, but associated clinical disease or pathology was not seen (Li et al., 2014).",

Rotaviruses have been identified in young ferrets and mink, with group A and C strains infecting ferret kits (Wise et al., 2009). Preweaning diarrhea syndrome of mink kits in Europe has been purported to be caused by mink calicivirus or astrovirus (Hammer et al., 2012). Coronaviruses are best described in the mink and ferret, where they can be clinically silent, or can cause epizootics characterized by rapid spread of diarrhea through naive colonies. The associated clinical disease is called epizootic catarrhal gastritis in mink, and epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE) in ferrets. Morbidity can be up to 100% in naive individuals, but overall mortality tends to be low. Viral cytopathic effects are most severe for enterocytes at the tips of intestinal villi, resulting in marked villous blunting and fusion, followed by lymphocytic infiltration into the subtending lamina propria. In ferrets, these lesions may be apparent up to 8 months postinfection. Feline coronavirus anti-gp70 antibody successfully cross-reacts with ferret coronavirus; immunohistochemical staining is readily demonstrated within villous epithelium, although it wanes with time. In ferrets, a fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-like syndrome was recently correlated with ferret enteric coronavirus infection. While unproven, the pathophysiology of feline enteric coronaviral infection characterized by viral mutation within infected individuals that facilitates persistence within macrophages is likely for ferrets as well. Affected ferrets develop multifocal granulomas, especially in the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes that contain ferret coronavirus (FeCov) antigen. The majority of cases resemble the \u201cdry form\u201d of FIP, with fewer cases resembling the \u201cwet\u201d form (Garner et al., 2008).",

AMD antibodies have been detected in mink, ferrets, otters, weasels, fisher, martens, raccoons, polecats, genets, and foxes (Allender et al., 2008). All color phases of mink may be infected, but color-dilute varieties genetically related to Aleutian strains are especially susceptible. Clinical infection is often associated with high antibody titers. Over months to years, chronic infection can produce high levels of circulating antigen\u2013antibody complexes that are deposited in host basement membranes and cause systemic arteritis and glomerulonephritis. Infected mink often have lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis and nephritis, and are especially susceptible to death from glomerulonephritis. Multifocal hemorrhage may occur due to vascular damage, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders related to severe monoclonal gammopathy; acute, severe hematuria may distend the bladder, resulting in a \u201ccherry-like\u201d appearance. Striped skunks often present differently, with lymphoplasmacytic nephritis, hepatitis, perivasculitis, and neuronal degeneration, but without glomerulonephritis. Counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) testing remains the gold standard for AMD diagnosis, especially in large, captive facilities, although ELISA tests are available. The clinical course of AMD in Aleutian strains of mink may be as rapid as 4 months, with environmental stress often accelerating disease progression. For other color strains and ferrets, a 2-year subclinical (and potentially infectious) phase is common.\n",

This bacterium was the major cause of death in 30% of Northern sea otters in one study of over 600 necropsied animals between 2004 and 2010.

S. lutetiensis sp. nov. is a primary pathogen for northern sea otters, and infection is associated with fatal meningoencephalitis and infective endocarditis that occurs in prime-age animals with no preexisting conditions (Counihan-Edgar et al., 2012, Counihan et al., 2015). Some infected animals die acutely in good nutritional condition with meningoencephalitis. Others die from chronic, severe vegetative valvular endocarditis of the left atrioventricular and/or aortic valves, often with a dilated, thin-walled left ventricle (Fig. 11.11\n), massive pulmonary edema, effusion, and multifocal thromboemboli with coagulation necrosis in the myocardium, kidneys, spleen, or descending aorta (secondary to saddle thrombus).

As part of in situ conservation programs, colonies located in areas where black-footed ferrets are concentrated or released are dusted with pesticides to control fleas to reduce disease risk. At necropsy, plague-infected ferrets display lesions similar to infected wild felids, with prominent vasculitis and necrohemorrhagic inflammation and perivascular accumulations of bacilli in submandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes (Williams et al., 1994). Vasculitis also occurs in the skin and lungs, resulting in subcutaneous hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, respectively. Myriad peri- and intravascular bacilli may be seen in other organs. The Siberian polecat appears to serve as a suitable model for plague in black-footed ferrets (Williams et al., 1991).

Supplemental Table e1 lists common and important metazoan and protozoan parasites in this family. This list is not all-inclusive; it simply reflects those that are reported in the literature. Expanded information on many of these parasites is available in the online Supplemental Materials. A metazoan parasite of note in the mustelids is Skrjabingylus nasicola. When infections are moderate to severe, there can be considerable remodeling of the frontal bone. In spite of this, the parasite is not a significant mortality factor in mustelids. Its lifecycle includes a mollusk intermediary host and a shrew or small rodent as a paratenic host. Adult worms are found in the nasal and frontal sinuses of mustelids. Skrjabingylus lutrae is a related nematode found in the sinuses of otters (Fig. 11.14\n).",

Wild and domestic felids are the only known definitive hosts, and mustelids serve as accidental, intermediate hosts. Terrestrial run-off from urban and agricultural areas is thought to transport the parasite to coastal marine waters, where invertebrates serving as prey for sea otters ingest and accumulate the parasite (Arkush et al., 2003, Miller et al., 2002, Miller et al., 2008b). In one study, 52% of necropsied southern sea otters, and 38% of live-sampled animals were seropositive to T. gondii (Conrad et al., 2005). Up to 16% mortality has been attributed to toxoplasmosis in fresh southern sea otters carcasses; subclinical infection is also common (Miller et al., 2004). No gross lesions are reported. Microscopic lesions include nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and lymphadenitis. Less commonly reported conditions are placentitis, abortion, and a single case of toxoplasmosis that was associated with congenital brain malformation (Miller et al., 2008b).",
