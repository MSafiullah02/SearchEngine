            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report of AOM caused by C. rectus. AOM is often considered to be a bacterial infection, but its pathogenesis actually involves complex interactions among viruses and bacteria [6]. In most children who develop AOM, viral infection of the upper respiratory tract initiates the cascade of events that finally leads to this condition [17]. Inflammation of the nasopharynx and Eustachian tube caused by viruses may allow bacteria to infect the middle ear. In the present patient, C. rectus could not be isolated by conventional culture at clinical laboratory in our hospital. However, we identified C. rectus by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and excluded the major bacterial and viral pathogens of AOM by PCR, RT-PCR, or real-time PCR. As a result, C. rectus was found to be the causative organism of severe AOM in this patient. C. rectus is difficult to culture and identify. It requires anaerobic conditions for optimal isolation, although the reported composition of the atmosphere needed for successful culture varies among authors [1]. Mahlene et al. obtained the isolate at the same culture conditions with us after 7 days incubation [1]. The supposable reasons why we could not obtain the isolate in spite of the same culture condition of the literature might be attributed to the prior administration of antimicrobial or short time cultivation time. Currently, identification of C. rectus is based on analysis of 16S rRNA. For clinical diagnosis of C. rectus infections, routine methods allowing accurate identification by microbiological laboratories are needed.",

Familial transmission of oral bacteria is generally accepted [18] and it had been recently suggested that oral bacteria could also be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs. Kato et al. reported that 92.3% of pet dogs analyzed in Japan had C. rectus in their oral flora [19]. In addition, Yamasaki et al. found that 66.7% of companion dogs and 21.0% of their owners were positive for C. rectus in oral samples [20]. C. rectus was detected in fecal samples of healthy or diarrheic pet dogs [21], and the fecal-oral transmission might be one of the possible rote. Because the present patient had dogs, it may be suggested that the origin of C. rectus infection was his companion pets. The route of spread was suspected to be from the oral cavity via the Eustachian tube to the middle ear. To clarify the relationship between C. rectus and AOM, further clinical and epidemiological studies among this organism, human and pet animals are needed.",

The present patient had several different characteristics from the previous 7 cases. First, all of the previous patients were adults, while this patient was an adolescent. Second, the previous patients had underlying diseases, while this patient had no predisposing factors except for keeping pets. Third, culture was positive in all of the previous patients, while it was negative in this case, although this may have been related to prior antimicrobial therapy. We previously reported that 16S rRNA gene analysis was useful in patients with culture negative infection [7], and we employed this technique to identify the microorganism in the middle ear fluid of this patient. Although 7/8 cases, including this patient, responded to surgery and/or antimicrobial therapy, it is noteworthy that one patient died of ruptured intracranial mycotic aneurysm. Thus, C. rectus infections can occur in previously healthy young people and are occasionally fatal, and C. rectus is a potential causative pathogen of culture negative AOM. Therefore, further investigation of this microorganism in patients with AOM seems to be warranted.",

This case suggests that C. rectus may be a possible causative pathogen of AOM. Accordingly, we need to perform culture while taking C. rectus into consideration in patients with AOM, and methods for its accurate identification by clinical microbiological laboratories are required. For adequate treatment of C. rectus infection, antibiotic selection guidelines and surveillance of its antimicrobial susceptibility profile are also required. Further clinical and epidemiological studies will be needed to clarify the relationship between C. rectus and AOM.",
