The doctor-patient relationship is complex and is built upon trust. That trust can be affected by many different factors, as discussed in Chap. 8. What happens when the ethical principles that create and strengthen the doctor-patient relationship conflict? In this chapter, we address many of the ethical principles that create a foundation for this relationship. Some of the principles that we explore include beneficence, acting in a patient's best interests, and doing no harm. Balancing these principles with a patient's right to make autonomous decisions to guide their own medical care, especially when a patient refuses a recommended treatment, can be difficult. Providing a patient with the appropriate information needed to make informed decisions and give consent to treatment can strengthen the trust held in the doctor-patient relationship, but giving insufficient information or not disclosing health information can harm that relationship, while at other times nondisclosure may be beneficial. Confidentiality is essential in maintaining a trusting relationship; however, there are times when those confidences may need to be broken. Lastly, acting justly and in an unbiased way and treating patients with respect is vital. But, what happens when a physician forms assumptions or biases towards their patient? How do we as",

A long-time patient of yours, Ann J., is coming in today to discuss the results of her tests and scans. Ann is a 52-year old who has managed to avoid the typical health problems of her peers through a health-conscious lifestyle. She is postmenopausal and has never been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She is well educated, reads up on current health issues, and sees you only for recommended checkups, flu shots, and the occasional sinusitis. A couple of weeks ago, she noticed a lump in her right breast while showering. Mammogram shows a BI-RADS 4 lesion; a subsequent core needle biopsy confirms an estrogen receptor (ER) + ductal carcinoma. Ann comes in with her husband, apprehensive that you asked for an office visit rather than just giving her results in a phone call. After you confirm that she does in fact have stage II breast cancer, you discuss treatment options and the necessary referrals, arrangements, and benefits/risks for those treatment options, including side effects and likely survival rates. You recommend that Ann be referred to a breast surgeon and an oncologist for a lumpectomy and radiation. Given that her tumor is ER positive, you tell her that the oncologist may recommend that she be on tamoxifen for several years after the tumor is removed. Ann is understandably stunned and overwhelmed by all of the information you just gave her, but you assure her that you will be there for her and are willing to try to answer any questions she might have.",

She agrees readily to the lumpectomy; however, she has done some research of her own. She and her husband are opposed to her taking unnatural, laboratory-produced chemicals or radiation into her body; they feel that her excellent health to this point has been secondary to her avoidance of such things. She has looked into an alternative natural herbal therapy offered by a physician out of the country. Her insurance will not pay for this treatment; however, she has the means and desire to pursue this treatment on her own. She contacts you to advise you of her plans and asks if you would be willing to research the alternative treatment for her before she goes.",

These medical decision-making modalities often involve trying to find a balance between beneficence and non-maleficence, as well as the concepts of paternalism and autonomy. Historically paternalism was the dominant model and the way that most physicians practiced. Paternalism is best described by the old adage \"the Doctor knows best.\" It is the concept that a person in authority knows best, and therefore their opinion can/should override the patient's preferences. In paternalism, beneficence is valued over autonomy (Jonsen et al. 2006 ). In the 1960s and 1970s, however, with societal and social changes, patients began to demand more involvement in the medical decision and choices that were made regarding their own bodies, and what is known as the \"Age of Autonomy\" began. Autonomy, taken literally, means \"self-rule\" (Lo 2013) . And autonomous decision-making refers to a physician's duty to respect a patient's preferences (Jonsen 9 Clinical Ethics and Professionalism et al. 2006) . Autonomy requires that a patient is, first, informed and, second, can then act on that information and make a decision regarding their treatment plan.",

The clinician should take into account what they know of the patient's values when giving their professional opinion (Jonsen et al. 2006) .

Finally, qualitative futility is the judgment that the goal that might be attained is not worthwhile. Considerations of these latter definitions of futility may include factors such as likelihood of success, quality of life, and use of resources (Jonsen et al. 2006; Lo 2013) . In Ann's case, the neurosurgeon made a decision of probabilistic futility. In his experience, he felt that surgery was likely to fail. In his despair, Ann's husband was requesting medical treatments that to our knowledge are inconsistent with her beliefs, wishes, and goals of care. Are her previous preferences important in knowing how to proceed with her case? and multiple smaller lesions in Ann's lungs and liver; it appears that her breast cancer has metastasized. Ann is not able to make decisions for herself given her altered mental state, but her husband is desperate to have any and all treatments given to his wife. He is sure that resection of the brain lesion accompanied by radiation and treatment with tamoxifen will result in a return of her mental function and shrinkage of the lung and liver lesions with an ultimate cure. Neurosurgery is consulted; their note states that \"surgical resection of Mrs. J.'s brain tumor, given the multiple metastases seen on CT, is futile and not worth the inherent risk of the procedure.\" Ann's husband is understandably upset and demands that you explain how any treatment that would prolong her life could be futile.",

Mr. Jones is a 72-year-old male patient with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and no other diagnosed medical conditions, largely due to the fact that he has never really sought medical care before. He presents with chest pain and describes the pain as a feeling of heaviness and pressure that spreads across his chest and up into his jaw. The pain has been occurring with activity for several weeks but has occurred at rest for two nights this past week. He has an impressive smoking history: He has smoked > 2 packs per day since he was 15 years old. He quit smoking 7 years ago when he was diagnosed with COPD but has not had any further medical treatment since that time. The electrocardiogram (EKG) is largely normal, and troponins are negative; however, the resting angina is concerning for acute coronary syndrome. You consult the cardiologist, who recommends that the patient go for angiogram and possible stenting. You happen to be outside the room when the cardiologist's staff obtains consent from your patient for the procedure, and you notice that none of the major complications of catheterization are mentioned: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or even death. In fact, the procedure is not explained well; it is explained to the patient as a very minor procedure that is necessary to prevent death. After the consent form is signed, you go in to talk to your patient; he is very concerned. He asks you if there is any way that medicine could be tried prior to angiogram and/or stenting. \"Is this procedure really safe? Is there any chance I could die?\"",

However, there are some general standards that all physicians should be aware of. In years past, most states used the reasonable physician standard: What would a reasonable and prudent physician tell a patient (regarding a specific treatment or procedure)? Today most state laws have changed their requirements to the reasonable patient standard: What information would a reasonable patient need to know to make a rational decision? Taking these standards one step further is the subjective standard or individual preference standard. This would involve a patient being informed on the basis of his individual attitudes/ beliefs/culture/lifestyle/goals of care. The information provided is specifically tailored to a particular patient's need for information and understanding. This standard requires that the physician get to know their patient reasonably well enough to know some of their preferences, beliefs, values, and goals. For example, while a 0.001 % change of numbness and decreased mobility of the patient's pinky finger following a procedure may not be a risk factor that would be important to mention to most patients, if the patient is a world famous concert pianist, using the subjective standard, it may be a risk that needs to be discussed.

They propose a process whereby the benefits of nondisclosure or the disclosure of biased, partial, or altered information is viewed in the context of minimizing the patient's suffering and/or increasing the patient's overall well-being. In the situation with Mr. Jones above, this would entail the clinician asking themselves whether nondisclosure would prevent suffering and then further exploring whether the benefits of nondisclosure outweigh the consequences of withholding the truth.

You have a long discussion with Mr. Jones's son about the newly diagnosed CHF and his prognosis. His son is understandably upset at this turn of events. He asks about treatment and palliation options. You describe in detail the medical management of CHF along with best and worst case prognoses. At the end of your discussion, Mr. Jones's son implores, \"Please don't tell him about this. Dad was having a tough time before all of this happened, and I'm afraid that after hearing the worst case scenario you just described, he might just lose any hope for recovery and will have no motivation to take the medications you prescribe.

Indeed, \"trust is fundamental to a moral community and arguably 'the fundamental virtue at the heart of being a good doctor'\" (Stirrat and Gill 2005) . It is impossible for this trust to be built on untruthfulness. In addition, the argument that full disclosure might upset the patient and impair their ability to make a truly informed decision is flawed, as people will get upset throughout their lives, but this does not mean that they are unable to make a rational decision.

The last couple of days he has complained to the nurse that he has been having stomachaches, occasional vomiting, and headaches, and he has voiced concerns that these symptoms may be a side effect of his medication. He has also become increasingly upset about these daily appointments, stating that having to drive across town every single day is causing his gas usage to significantly increase. The clinic nurse addresses and treats some of the side effects that he seems to be having, and enrolls him into an incentive program that helps pay for his gas expenses if he continues to show good compliance with the program for one more week. The next day, however, he does not show up for his appointment. The nurse notifies the doctor in charge at the clinic, who decides to give him one to two more days to re-present for his medications. Three days later, he still has not returned for his treatment medication, and the hospital laboratory calls to notify the clinic that Mr. L.'s test results came back. He is not only positive for AFB but it is also a multidrug resistant strain.",

The use of quarantine and isolation, particularly when done forcibly and against someone's will, can be ethically problematic. Some feel that quarantine measures are necessary in order to protect public health and are essential to prevent and control communicable disease spread; however, others believe that it violates a person's right of liberty, selfdetermination, and autonomy. The American Medical Association has developed a report addressing this particular issue (American Medical Association 2006) .

Further complicating this assessment is the frequent overlap between patients with genuine pain issues and coexisting medication misuse. As a health-care provider, it is imperative that you do not facilitate a drug habit; however, it is equally vital that you address any legitimate pain your patient is having. Indeed, pain is a common reason for patients to seek health care. Pain agreements are a way to equitably manage pain issues with patients. Components of a pain agreement may include an agreement to avoid improper use of pain medications, agreements to only obtain pain medication from one provider (you), limitations on replacing medication, agreement for random drug screening, appointment terms, and terms for disciplinary termination of the pain contract (Fishman et al. 1999) . As physicians can be liable for both facilitating a drug habit and for failure to address a patient's medical issues, a pain contract may help protect them legally. It is important, however, to have equal implementation and enforcement of pain contracts in order to avoid bias. Many patients with uncontrollable chronic pain could benefit from a referral to a pain management clinic, if one is available.",

Forming a treatment plan based on subjective assumptions rather than more objective assessments can result in an inappropriate treatment plan. For example, an assumption that a patient is unreliable can deny the patient appropriate, albeit more complicated treatment. An assumption of a patient's motives (such as labeling a patient as just seeking pain medication, as in this case) can deny the patient appropriate and needed treatment. An assumption about a patient's assets and access to health-care resources may result in a patient not being notified of resources available to them. Assuming that a patient will not comprehend technical information about their condition can result in a patient making a less informed treatment decision. At its worst, an assumption about a patient can cause a clinician to dismiss vital physical complaints. Physicians should attempt to refute or confirm their assumptions, prior to any negative impact that can occur with regard to medical decision-making. Clinicians must learn to skillfully navigate the fine line between clinical judgment and assumption (Rhodes 2005) .",

When examining his back, you see a large tattoo and shake your head. As you continue your exam, you come across another tattoo on his upper arm. This one catches your eye, and you notice it is a military rifle, standing upright on the ground next to a pair of soldier's boots and a helmet resting on the end of the rifle. Further discussion with him reveals that he is a veteran of the US Army where he was a lieutenant. He was wounded while in Afghanistan when an improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated near the vehicle he was in. Two of the four occupants were wounded severely, while the other two died. All were under his command. He suffered a significant back injury, which has left him in chronic pain. Since leaving the army, he has been seeking a job and is excited that he has an interview the next day for a position for which he can use his degree in communications. He is somewhat nervous about the interview, though, since he travels by public transportation and does not want to be late. Fiester (2012) states that anywhere from 15-60 % of patients are deemed \"difficult\" patients; patients with more complaints or conditions (this patient in this vignette had multiple) are more likely to be deemed \"difficult\" by their health-care provider. Interestingly, however, it is physicians who score lower on empathy scales that are more likely to perceive patients as difficult. At a glance, the patient described above could be described as difficult, especially given his less than amicable separation from his previous health-care provider and his stated purpose of seeking narcotics. How would this patient's care have been affected if the provider had not noticed his military-related tattoo and assumed the worst? Patients often complain that doctors do not listen to them; clinicians need be aware of their preconceived perceptions and utilize listening skills that will help clinical facts overcome these preconceived perceptions (Fiester 2012 ).",

Your patient refuses to comply with a recommended treatment regimen due to concerns of potential side effects and the belief that alternative treatment modalities will be as effective as the ones prescribed by you. In respecting their decision to pursue alternative treatments you are respecting their right to:a. Practice paternalistic medicine b. Make autonomous decisions c. Justice and equality in health care d. Confidentiality and adherence to HIPAA regulations Answer: B. Your patient is exercising their right to make autonomous decisions regarding their health care. Autonomous decision-making refers to a physician's duty to respect a patient's preferences.2. Short answer: The differences between legal and ethical standards for informed consent are:Answer: The law requires that patients be informed regarding their illness and recommended treatments or procedures. It in general gives physicians some guidance for minimum standards and information that needs to be provided to patients. Ethical guidelines, however, push those standards a little farther. Ethical ideals recommend that informed consent be individualized to include information that may be considered important to each particular patient based upon what the physician knows about that patient's beliefs, culture, life goals, etc.",
