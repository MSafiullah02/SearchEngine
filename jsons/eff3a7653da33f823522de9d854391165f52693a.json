Although local disasters such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes have impacted segments of our country, no currently practicing physician has ever before experienced a national pandemic of the magnitude and severity of the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, we have never before had to acknowledge and evaluate the impact that a pandemic of this type will have on Graduate Medical Education and Board Certification. The primary concern of the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) is protecting the public while also ensuring the well-being and competency of orthopaedic surgeons as we treat and suffer from this disease. We applaud the extraordinary efforts being made by our nation's healthcare professionals including many of our ABOS Diplomates and Candidates. We recognize that our focus in the near term will remain on the global crisis from both the professional and personal standpoints. The primary objective for our residents, fellows, and Diplomates should be to safely and successfully manage our families, patients, practices, and hospitals through this crisis collaboratively across all specialties. The ABOS will make every attempt to allow physicians to focus on the needs of their community and minimize the impact on their ABOS Board Certification processes. We are committed to flexibility in all our programs as we fight through the challenges ahead.",

The ability to average time away from education year over year was designed to provide flexibility for extended absences, including illness and paternity/maternity leave. This policy may allow for an ability to deal with time loss secondary to the viral pandemic and potential quarantine or illness issues. If the COVID-19 crisis follows a time course that is not prolonged, residents should be able to meet these time requirements without extending their residency training period. If that is not possible, the ABOS is committed to working with Program Directors on a case-by-case basis.",

In light of this potential issue, the ABOS has modified its approach for the 2021 Case List collection process. This modification was designed to help those individuals whose practice caseloads have been negatively affected by the pandemic, ensuring each Candidate every opportunity to reach the caseload minimum and effectively represent their typical practice pattern. Based on the past year's applicant case logs, we estimate that more than 200 candidates would have failed to meet the minimum number of surgical cases performed in 6 months (35) to be eligible to sit for the examination. Thus, the case collection period has been expanded to make up for low volume months. The case collection period will be back dated to January 1, 2020, and extended until September 30, 2020. Starting with the first day in January, Candidates must collect and submit all consecutive surgical cases that they perform as primary surgeons for a minimum of six consecutive months. At that point, if the candidate has reached 250 or greater surgical cases, they can cease collecting. If not, they will continue to collect until 250 cases or the date September 30 is reached, whichever comes first.",

Orthopaedic surgeons have reached out to the ABOS offices inquiring as to opening the ABOS WLA Assessment window sooner than the expected date April 15 so that they could begin answering the assigned questions for their 15 Knowledge Sources. In response to the pandemic and our Diplomates' needs, we extended the time to participate by opening the examination window earlier (April 1, 2020) and making it available until June 1, 2020.
