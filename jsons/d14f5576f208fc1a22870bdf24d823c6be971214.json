According to the Law of Prevention of Infectious Diseases of mainland China, there are 35 notifiable infectious diseases, divided into three classes, i.e. classes A, B, and C. Of these, 27 must be reported. For example, if local hospitals found cases of plague or cholera (both class A), or AIDS or pulmonary anthrax (both class B), they had to inform the district \u2044 county CDC and local HD by telephone within 6 h in urban and within 12 h in rural areas and complete the reporting form for infectious diseases immediately. Then, the district \u2044 county CDC investigated the case at once, notified the provincial \u2044 city CDC and concurrently forwarded the information to the local HD (PRC 1989) . Forms reporting cases of infectious diseases were sent or mailed to the district \u2044 county CDC. After integration of all data from the whole district \u2044 county, summary data of infectious diseases were sent to the provincial CDC and district \u2044 county every month. In the same way, summary data integrated by provincial CDC were sent to the national CDC and to the same level HD. (Figure 1 ).

An effective response system relies on a sound surveillance system for infectious diseases. The quality of data collection plays an important role in the process of infectious diseases control and prevention (Pan 2004) . The national infectious disease reporting system, which covered all levels of CDCs based on a network for reporting data of notifiable infectious disease by month, could not meet the need of daily data collection in emergency situations. At the time, rather than a surveillance system for new and existing infectious diseases, it was a data management system for existing ones (Pan 2004) . The system could not detect emerging infectious diseases as it did not possess a monitoring and alert function. There was also a lack of coordination and collaboration among fragmented governmental HDs. Furthermore, the hospital information system is indepen- dent of the infectious disease management system and the data of infectious disease reported by level. Thus, information on the SARS epidemic was not exchanged and the chance missed to detect the outbreak early and to put in place adequate control measures (Pan 2004 ). Finally, there was a lack of reflection on the information about cases, which could not be modified over time by local CDCs, once the cases were submitted to be included in the national database (Tang et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2004a,b; Xie et al. 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 280, "end": 290, "text": "(Pan 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 670, "end": 680, "text": "(Pan 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1209, "text": "(Pan 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1426, "text": "(Tang et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1446, "text": "Liu et al. 2004a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1463, "text": "Xie et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The case definition for 'atypical infectious pneumonia', later termed SARS, was modified during the course of the SARS epidemic in mainland China. Table 1 presents the clinical criteria of SARS cases during the epidemic (CDC 2003a-c,e). The first clinical criterion of probable SARS was mainly used for diagnosis for the cases in Guangdong province until 31 January 2003. It was based on symptoms and signs of febrile respiratory illness, decreased white blood cells, abnormal chest X-ray, close contact with SARS cases, being a member of an infectious cluster, having infected another person, or failed antibiotic treatment within 72 h. Data of probable cases during that time were collected retrospectively (PRC 2003) . This definition became the national criterion for the diagnosis of SARS cases whose onset date was after 1 February (CDC 2003a), and was recommended to other provinces and cities on 14 April by the Chinese Ministry of Health (MOH). The first clinical definition of SARS was revised on 3 May by adding the epidemiological criterion of having visited or resided in a city or area, where SARS cases were reported during 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. in addition, criteria for 'probable', 'suspected', and 'excluded' cases of SARS were defined. After 1 May, the criteria for a SARS case included evidence of laboratory findings of SARS-CoV (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003) , when laboratory testing became available . Bias and misdiagnosis in data collection were inevitable once SARS emerged in China. Both case definition and standard and sensitive diagnostic criteria were updated over the course of the epidemic. Diagnosis of a SARS case was by exclusion, meaning that a case could be excluded as SARS if it matched the diagnostic criterion of another disease (WHO 2003b) . Most of the SARS cases in the various databases are probable cases as diagnosed by the SARS clinical criterion of the Chinese Ministry of Health, WHO, United States CDC, and Hong Kong since. Clinical diagnosis was the only means to recognise SARS, because reliable serological detection methods for SARS did not yet exist. Misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis may have resulted from limited knowledge about SARS, especially early in the epidemic, from the often mild clinical appearance of cases, and from the old age of some cases, usually combined with chronic disease (Anonymous 2003c; Liu et al. 2003a Liu et al. , 2004a Liu et al. ,b, 2005 Liang et al. 2004a; Shi et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2004; Che et al. 2006; Si et al. 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 709, "end": 719, "text": "(PRC 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1383, "text": "(Drosten et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1404, "text": "Ksiazek et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1807, "text": "(WHO 2003b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2374, "end": 2391, "text": "(Anonymous 2003c;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2408, "text": "Liu et al. 2003a", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2427, "text": "Liu et al. , 2004a", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2447, "text": "Liu et al. ,b, 2005", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2467, "text": "Liang et al. 2004a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2468, "end": 2484, "text": "Shi et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2485, "end": 2500, "text": "Wu et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2501, "end": 2517, "text": "Che et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2518, "end": 2533, "text": "Si et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 154, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Definition of SARS"}, {"text": "We integrated all databases derived from the various levels of the Chinese national and military health systems, which contained individual reported information of all probable and suspected cases.

Among these, lack of an effective surveillance system is of primary importance. Surveillance is the key to containment efforts and provides ready access to timely information on the number of new cases, the likely source of exposure, the number of cases not previously identified as contacts, and the number of contacts with high-risk exposures to known cases (Parashar & Anderson 2004) . First, an effective national integrated data reporting system is the foundation of a public health system. Such systems did exist for infectious and occupational diseases and food or environmental poisoning . But, data were still submitted by telephone level-by-level, without feedback and evaluation of the quality of reported data, and possible missing or duplicated cases. Neither did those systems involve information of clinical case tracing or results of laboratory tests. Efficient surveillance for infectious diseases should link clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data on cases and to disseminate this information locally, nationally and globally.
