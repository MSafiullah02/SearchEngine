Since the late nineties of the 20th century, due to the improved sequencing techniques and high throughput sequencing machines, the number of sequences submitted to databases like GenBank\u00ae has increased exponentially. This results in an enormous increase of identified variants and quasi-species as well as sequences of newly discovered pathogens from all over the world. A few examples are the discovery of coronaviruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Nipah and Hendra viruses, atypical pestiviruses, atypical and new serotypes of bluetongue virus, Schmallenberg virus and new variants of avian influenza viruses (Chua et al., 2000; Demmler and Ligon, 2003; Drosten et al., 2003; Hoffmann et al., 2012; Hofmann et al., 2008; Maan et al., 2011; Marcacci et al., 2018; Schirrmeier et al., 2004; van Boheemen et al., 2012; Wang, 2011; Zientara et al., 2014).",

Favourably, PCR tests can be highly sensitive and specific, and are often designed to detect all variants of a defined family, genus or species, while not detecting closely related pathogens. In addition, PCRv can also be used to validate in silico PCR assays that differentiate between lineages, serotypes or variants. Therefore, PCR targets must be unique, and highly conserved. Nonetheless, false negative results can arise by genetic drifting or by emergence of new variants, while false positive results can be caused by new variants of closely related pathogens. It is therefore important to frequently re-evaluate and, if necessary, redesign PCR tests taking sequences of newly discovered pathogen variants into account.",

In silico validation covers the study on inventory of matching and non-matching sequences of the PCR target sequence in a nucleotide database. Matching sequences enable in silico sensitivity (detection of all variants), while non-matching sequences support in silico specificity (selective detection of variants of the respective group of pathogens). In vitro and in vivo validation include testing of cultured pathogens, and field samples of defined positive and negative status. In vitro and in vivo validation for all virus variants is practically impossible and extremely costly. Even more, not every pathogen variant has been cultured or isolated, and transport and handling of pathogens could imply safety issues. In contrast, sequences are rapidly becoming available by high throughput and deep sequencing, even without culturing of pathogens. Therefore, in silico re-evaluation of validated PCR diagnostics is and will be an attractive alternative to obtain detailed insight in detection of circulating and (re-) emerging virus variants, and should be frequently executed. It will however become an increasing task due to the rapid increase of available sequences and full genome sequences of numerous species.",

            "text": "The sequences of a target organism are downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/) by using the respective taxonomy ID number as search query. This guarantees that all available sequences of the defined taxon in the database are downloaded. To generate a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of these sequences, a full genome sequence was selected as a reference sequence. Genome segments of pathogens with a segmented genome were concatenated to serve as an artificial full length genome. If a full genome sequence was not available, a representative large sequence of the taxon was selected as a reference sequence. A prerequisite is that this partial sequence contained the full target of the PCR test being validated. In order to drastically reduce computing time, pairwise alignments were calculated for each downloaded sequence to the reference sequence by using software program ClustalW 2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007). To correct for orientation errors in the database sequences, alignment in the reverse complement orientation was also attempted. A score was calculated using a scoring scheme as follows: match (+1), mismatch (-2), point deletion or gap (-3), every next adjacent point deletion (-2). The aligned orientation with the highest score was selected. To enable efficient alignment of large sequences, these large sequences were segmented in fragments of 10,000 nucleotides in length and individually aligned to the reference sequence and subsequently combined into one pairwise alignment. PCRv combined all individual pairwise alignments into one multiple sequence alignment (MSA), including the pairwise alignments of primers and probes. The calculation of the MSA was performed by a computer with an Intel\u00ae Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v2 @ 3.50 GHz processor and 16 Gb of internal computer memory. The regions corresponding to primers and probes were selected from the MSA to construct a conservation plot sorted in decreasing total number of mismatches. The in silico sensitivity was expressed as the percentage of hits with a cut-off value of a maximum of one mismatch per primer or probe.",

            "text": "The entire nucleotide sequence database (compressed gzip file: nt.gz) was downloaded from the NCBI FTP-website (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/) using PCRv. The integrity of the download was confirmed by calculation of the MD5 checksum and subsequent comparison with the checksum published on the FTP-website (file nt.gz.md5). PCRv processed the data stream during download by several optimizations to improve the analysis. Nucleotide code \u2018N\u2019 was replaced by the meaningless code \u2018Z\u2019, which prevents infinite number of hits by the alignment search. The data stream was unpacked and subdivided into multiple fasta formatted text files. Fasta files with a maximum size of 500 MB were sequentially numbered and stored because the NCBI nucleotide database is too large to be analysed all at once. To increase the accuracy of the alignment search (see Discussion), large sequences were fragmented in sequences of maximal 3000 nucleotides with an overlap of 50 nucleotides to prevent the loss of hits of primer or probe sequences spanning the split site. Fragmented sequences were tagged with a unique code allowing reconstruction of the original sequence. Any nucleotide database in fasta format is compatible and could be added. Flagged internal control sequences (FICS) were added to enable validation of the alignment search. FICS consisted of randomly generated sequences of 3000 nucleotides in length containing primer and probe sequences of the PCR test being validated. Primer and probe sequences were inserted in all possible combinations and orientations potentially initiating amplification (Fig. 1\n). Multiple copies of each combination were inserted with an increasing number of randomly introduced mismatches from 0\u201310 in each primer and probe sequence (Fig. 1). In total, ten copies of each control sequence per number of mismatches were linearly spread in each 500 MB fasta file. An alignment search was performed with the default expectancy threshold value on all fasta files using primers and probes of the PCR test as search queries and the program SSEARCH available in the FASTA sequence analysis package (Brenner et al., 1998; Pearson, 1991; Pearson et al., 2017; Smith and Waterman, 1981; Smith et al., 1981). PCRv produced a list of hits of the alignment search of all possible primer/probe combinations potentially leading to detectable amplicons. Hits of FICS were stored separately. The percentage of returned hits of control sequences with an increasing number of mismatches was indicative for the sensitivity and accuracy of the alignment search per 500 MB fasta file. The maximum number of returned mismatches in the control sequences was determined by use of the Spearman-K\u00e4rber method and demonstrated the validity of the computing process (Wulff et al., 2012). An aborted search caused by an unknown error was visible by the incompleteness of returned FICS. If the accuracy of the alignment search was not acceptable, the alignment search was repeated with a higher expectancy threshold value, which usually resulted in a longer analysis time. The specificity check was limited to a maximum of 5000 nucleotides in amplicon length and up to four mismatches per primer or probe. This limitation was however not applied to the FICS in order to fully ascertain the validity of the executed alignment search. Hits were interpreted as specific or nonspecific according to the taxonomy classified sequences as used to generate the MSA. The in silico specificity is expressed as the percentage of specific hits of taxonomy classified sequences with a maximum of one mismatch per primer or probe as these are considered to be detected with the respective PCR test.",

The regions corresponding to primers and probes were taken from the alignment in order to construct a conservation plot. Detailed results were sorted according to the number of mismatches to easily select individual sequences with >1 mismatch in order to check their origin (Supplemented data A). Note, sequences incorrectly classified as WNV as well as synthetically derived sequences should be discarded as these are irrelevant. Results of the conservation plot were summarized according to the number of mismatches to a maximum of four mismatches per primer or probe (Table 2\n).The overall in silico sensitivity of each PCR test was calculated and expressed as the percentage of sequences with a maximum of one mismatch per primer or probe.

The download was valid according to the calculated MD5 checksum compared to the one published on the FTP-website. The data stream was processed using PCRv as described (Methods). Briefly, downloaded large sequences were fragmented, all sequences were stored in separate fasta formatted text files of 500 MB, and FICS were added. A total of 371 files (215 GB) were stored containing 49,967,663 sequences. An alignment search with primer and probe sequences was performed with a cut-off expectation value E of 5000. The search per PCR test was completed in less than two hours. About 3.7\u20136.9 million individual primer and probe alignment hits were found and processed by PCRv as described (Fig. 2). FICS were found homogeneously in all 371 database files indicating that the alignment search was completed properly. FICS for each PCR test were returned with a mean of 3.7\u20134.3 mismatches per primer or probe demonstrating completeness and acceptable accuracy of the alignment search (Table 2). Potential amplicons were interpreted as specific or non-specific according to the presence of its NCBI accession number in the list of sequences as used for the in silico sensitivity check (Table 2). We noticed that the number of specific hits differed from the numbers as scored by the in silico sensitivity check (Table 2). However, several reasons for this apparent inconsistency can be considered, see Discussion. In summary, using WNV PCR tests as an example, PCRv easily determined the in silico sensitivity and specificity of these PCR tests of different formats in a highly automated manner. All results are included in the validation report generated by PCRv, such as a summarizing table of results, conservation plot and a list of nonspecific hits. The summarizing table clearly demonstrates the differences of the in silico sensitivity and specificity between these PCR tests (Table 2). In addition, the detailed conservation plot (Supplemented data A) and detailed list of nonspecific hits up to 4 mismatches per primer or probe (Supplemented data B) support manual check of individual sequences on correctness, background, submission details, and other information.",

Because of the availability of sequences of pathogens in databases, checking conservation and uniqueness of primer and probe sequences, so-called in silico validation, has become an attractive and reliable alternative to (re-) evaluate specificity and sensitivity of molecular diagnostics. Exponential expansion of available sequences, genetic drift of pathogens, and discovery of new pathogens drive the need to frequently validate established PCR tests. This, however, will also become an increasing significant effort. We automated the in silico validation process by integrating freely available software programs into a single tool named PCRv. Public databases, such as NCBI as well as other available databases and sequences formatted in single sequence fasta files are compatible with PCRv.",

Software program ClustalW2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007) is used to calculate pair-wise alignments of each sequence to the reference sequence, and subsequently a MSA is generated using these pair-wise alignments. This strategy exponentially reduces calculation time, in particular for large numbers of sequences. Additionally, more than one reference sequence could be used to improve the generation of a MSA in case of extreme variability among a group of pathogens. The MSA is used to determine the in silico sensitivity, since this is less prone to mismatches in primers or probes (not shown). For example, sequences with numerous mismatches in one of the primers or probes will not be found by an alignment search using these primer or probe sequences as search queries. However, such sequences will be present in the MSA, see conservation plots of WNV PCR tests. Supplemented data A shows the summarised - without accession numbers - conservation plots of the three WNV PCR tests. PCRv generates a conservation plot listing all hits according to decreasing number of mismatches. Hits with the most mismatches needs attention as these could lead to false negative PCR results. We calculated and defined the in silico sensitivity as the percentage of hits with a maximum of one mismatch per primer or probe as these are assumed to be detected with the respective PCR test.",

In contrast, the percentage of returns with BlastN is slightly less than 100% for three mismatches and rapidly declines by an increasing number of mismatches. We conclude that SSEARCH is much more accurate, and thus more suitable than BlastN to determine the in silico specificity. We also noticed that BlastN tends to find partial/fractional nucleotide alignment hits which is not desirable for primers and probes. In addition, PCRv using SSEARCH is suitable for use in a laboratory quality control system, since the search process is monitored per 500 MB fasta file for completeness and accuracy/sensitivity by returned hits of flagged internal control sequences (FICS). An overview of this monitoring is added to the validation report. Examples of incomplete, inaccurate or alignment searches with a low sensitivity are presented (Supplemented data C).

This can result in more hits for the in silico specificity check by SSEARCH than for the in silico sensitivity check by ClustalW 2.1.

We used PCRv to analyse OIE-recommended and published PCR tests for other pathogens in order to select the best option for implementation in laboratory diagnostics.
