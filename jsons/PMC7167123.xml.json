However, the main limitation of these techniques is that the maximum number of viruses detectable in a single assay is relatively small. DNA microarray has gained much attention in detecting pathogens due to its high\u2010throughput and the explosive growth of pathogen genomic sequences available in public databases. In recent years, low\u2010density microarrays with short oligonucleotide probes (such as 20\u201330 mer that are sensitive to single\u2010base mismatches) have been used to detect or identify subtypes of known viruses [Sengupta et al., 2003; Boriskin et al., 2004; Korimbocus et al., 2005;J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen et al., 2006]. High\u2010density microarray with long oligonucleotide probes (such as 60\u201370 mer) have been explored to detect a large number of viruses and identify unknown or unsequenced members of existing viral families [Wang et al., 2002, 2003; Palacios et al., 2007]. However, relatively low specificity and sensitivity and complex analytical processes are the major limitations when pan\u2010viral oligonucleotide arrays are used to detect viral pathogens [Chou et al., 2006]. One reason for low sensitivity and low specificity is the low level of viral nucleic acids compared with that of the host genome within the sample preparation. As nucleic acids from unknown viruses can only be amplified with sequence\u2010independent PCR methods before microarray hybridization, the low level of viral nucleic acids in a sample make it probable that the vast majority of amplicons produced by random amplification do not contain the target sequences of interest, which in turn, reduces hybridization specificity and detection sensitivity. Thousands of oligonucleotide probes printed on arrays also make the analysis of hybridization unwieldy.",

By using oligonucleotide probes only at the genus level, the numbers of oligonucleotide probes printed on arrays was decreased dramatically, which in turn, made the analytical process more straightforward. To improve the specificity and accuracy of the microarray, the host genomic DNA and RNA were removed before viral RNA extraction [Chou et al., 2006]. Furthermore, to reduce the interference of host genomes on microarray hybridization, non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides were used for reverse transcription. All the known genomic\u2010size viral sequences include non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides [Allander et al., 2005], therefore, non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides can reverse transcribe viral RNA more efficiently than ribosomal RNA of host cells. Finally, the specificity of the microarray was validated by using cultured viruses from different genera.",

A total of 32 RNA viral genera from 14 viral families were included in this study. Viral genome sequences were downloaded from Genbank. To select the most conserved regions, viral sequences in each genus were aligned by software ClustalX (version 1.83). Arraydesigner 4.0 was employed for designing the oligonucleotide probes. Some probes published by other groups [Wang et al., 2002, 2003; Chou et al., 2006] were adopted and modified for this study. Generally, 10\u201330 oligonucleotides of 63\u2010mer were designed and selected to cover all the isolates in each genus, and in total, 628 viral oligonucleotide probes were included. Tm value of these oligonucleotides was 75 \u00b1 5\u00b0C, which was necessary to ensure that all the oligonucleotides had similar hybridization dynamics. By sequence alignment analysis, the significant homology of each oligonucleotide sequence with the sequences in the same genus was >25 nt.

The mixture contained 96 non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides [Endoh et al., 2005]; each linked to a specific primer sequence (GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TC). After RNase H digestion, synthesized cDNA was amplified with a 1:9 mixture of the non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotide mixture and a primer that targeted the specific primer sequence, as previously described [Wang et al., 2002].

A total of six cultured viruses were used for comparison and validation of the microarray.

The hybridization results of non\u2010pretreated viruses were difficult to interpret due to cross\u2010hybridization (data not shown). The number of oligonucleotide probes decreased dramatically compared to other pan\u2010viral microarrays [Wang et al., 2002, 2003; Palacios et al., 2007], therefore, analysis of the hybridization results was simplified significantly because of the reduction in intensive computation. Although non\u2010specific hybridization could not be avoided completely, the positive results could easily be judged by TreeView\u2010analyzed graphs. Furthermore, the specificity of the assays using pretreated cultures was improved significantly compared with non\u2010pretreated cultures (Fig. 2). From the hybridization imaging and TreeView\u2010analyzed graphs, non\u2010specific hybridization was decreased significantly.

Due to the tolerance of long oligonucleotides to sequence mismatches, these arrays have been used to detect many known viruses and to identify unknown or unsequenced members of existing viral families. Derisi's group first designed 1,600 viral oligonucleotides (70\u2010mers) that represented about 140 viruses in 2002 [Wang et al., 2002], and the number was increased to 10,000, which covered about 1,000 viruses in 2003 [Wang et al., 2003]. They identified the novel SARS coronavirus and confirmed that the combination of array hybridization followed by direct viral sequence recovery can serve as a general strategy. With this strategy, novel viruses and emerging infectious disease can be rapidly identified and characterized. Lipkin's group have developed GreeneChipVr version 1.0 that contains 9,477 probes for all vertebrate viruses in the integrated ICTV/NCBI database (1,710 species) [Palacios et al., 2007]. These studies have highlighted the potential of pan\u2010viral microarrays for detection of many known and unknown viral isolate. To increase the specificity, Chou et al. [2006] have developed a new method to design probes using genus and species probe sets to facilitate a cross\u2010examination strategy. The identity of a virus is established by the concordant results for the genus\u2010 and species\u2010specific probes. However, too many oligonucleotides make the analytical program rather complicated.

            "text": "Compared with the host genomes, the relatively low number of viral nucleic acids is another drawback of microarrays for broad virus screening. The over\u2010representation of the host genome in the total nucleic acid population is a major factor that interferes with microarray analysis. In pan\u2010microbial microarray detection, unknown pathogens are amplified with sequence\u2010independent PCR methods, such as random\u2010primed PCR [Froussard, 1992; Vora et al., 2004; Allander et al., 2005] and sequence\u2010independent single primer amplification (SISPA) [Reyes and Kim, 1991; Linnen et al., 1996; Ambrose and Clewley, 2006]. Both methods are efficient but non\u2010selectively amplify all DNA in the sample. Inevitably, the host genomes are abundantly amplified due to their high representation within total nucleic acids during sample preparations, either from viral cultures or virus\u2010infected clinical specimens. To improve the detection specificity of microarrays, DNase I/RNase T1 digestion was used before RNA extraction, and reversely transcribed RNA with non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotide mixed primers. As viral nucleic acids are generally protected from DNase degradation by the more stable protein capsids, and sometimes also by a lipid envelope [Allander et al., 2001], DNase I/RNase T1 treatment can effectively remove the host genomes. A large quantity of rRNA from host genomes reduces the efficiency of reverse transcription of viral RNA, therefore, the adoption of non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides as primers can enhance the reverse transcription of viral RNA. Daiji et al. [2005] have confirmed that sequences of selected non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides are normally present in known viral sequences. Based on this finding, reverse transcription was performed by using these 96 non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides; each of which was linked to a specific tag sequence as the primer. This can further decrease the interference of host genomes.",

The results confirmed the feasibility of this microarray method. The genus\u2010specific oligonucleotide microarray hybridization combined with degenerate or specific RT\u2010PCR, followed by sequencing analysis, could serve as a feasible strategy for the rapid identification and characterization of RNA viruses. As with unknown viral isolate, once it is known to which genus the unknown isolate belongs, subsequent specific RT\u2010PCR and sequencing identification are relatively easy to perform.",
