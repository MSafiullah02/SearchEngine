            "text": "Respiratory infections can cause wheezing illnesses in children of all ages and also influence the development and severity of asthma in several ways. First, viral wheezing episodes during infancy are a critical risk factor for asthma inception. Once asthma is established, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most common trigger for acute exacerbations. Furthermore, a potential role for particular bacterial pathogens in the development of wheezing and asthma exacerbations has been identified. This chapter will review the relationships between infections and asthma inception and exacerbation. Additionally, we discuss mechanisms by which infections lead to lower respiratory inflammation and airway dysfunction. Finally, we discuss treatment strategies for virus-induced wheezing and exacerbations of asthma.",

            "text": "VIRUSES Viral respiratory illnesses leading to wheezing are one of the most common causes of hospitalization during infancy. Using multiple virus detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Jartti and colleagues 1 investigated the etiology of wheezing illness in 293 hospitalized children. Of the 76 infants with virus detected, 54% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 42% had picornaviruses (human rhinovirus [RV] and enterovirus) and 1% had human metapneumovirus (hMPV). In older children, respiratory picornaviruses, most commonly RV, dominated (65% of children aged 1 to 2 years and 82% of children aged \u2265 3 years). Outpatient wheezing illnesses are also extremely common in young children, and viruses have been implicated in 67% to 90% of these episodes in different populations. 2, 3 Wheezing with viruses during infancy is often an early manifestation of asthma. Several large, long-term prospective studies of children have demonstrated that RSV bronchiolitis is a significant independent risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma, at least within the first decade of life. 4, 5 A recent clinical trial comparing palivizumab (anti-RSV monoclonal antibody) to placebo in near preterm infants demonstrated reductions in recurrent wheezing during the first year of life in the children treated with palivizumab. 6 This is the strongest level of evidence to date in support of a causal role for RSV in recurrent wheezing. However, a longitudinal, population-based cohort study has demonstrated that the association between RSV lower respiratory infections during early life and both frequent (more than three episodes) and infrequent wheezing (less than three episodes) decreases with age and becomes nonsignificant by the age of 13 years. 4 These data suggest that although RSV infections contribute substantially to the risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma in early childhood, other co-factors (e.g. genetic, environmental, developmental) also contribute to the expression of asthma or modification of phenotypes over time. Interestingly, a 2013 study identified unique immune response profiles during and after RSV bronchiolitis in comparison with bronchiolitis caused by other viruses. 7 With the development of molecular diagnostics, significant evidence has emerged to suggest that wheezing illnesses caused by RV identify children at highest risk for childhood asthma. 2, 8 The Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) birth cohort study confirmed prior associations between RSV wheezing in the first 3 years of life and childhood asthma, but demonstrated that RV wheezing during this time is associated with a greater, 10-fold increased risk of childhood asthma. 2 Mechanisms by which recurrent RV infections may lead to wheezing and airway remodeling, particularly in susceptible hosts, have been described. 9 A new species of RV, RV-C, was recently discovered, 10, 11 and has been shown to be an important cause of lower respiratory illnesses and wheezing in children. [12] [13] [14] A longitudinal analysis within the COAST study demonstrated that both RV-A and RV-C were more likely than RV-B to cause moderateto-severe respiratory illnesses in infants. 15 Whether RV-C wheezing illnesses confer a greater risk of childhood asthma development is currently unknown.",

With the advent of these more sensitive diagnostic tools, information linking common cold infections with exacerbations of asthma has come from a number of sources. Prospective studies of children with asthma have demonstrated that up to 85% of exacerbations of wheezing or asthma in children are associated with viral infections. 34 Although many respiratory viruses can provoke acute asthma symptoms, RVs are most often detected, especially during the spring and fall RV seasons. In fact, the spring and fall peaks in hospitalizations because of asthma closely coincide with patterns of RV isolation within the community. 35 RV infections, most commonly RV-C, are frequently detected in children who present to emergency departments with acute wheezing and in children hospitalized for acute asthma. 12, 14, 36 Influenza and RSV are somewhat more likely to trigger acute asthma symptoms in the winter but appear to account for a smaller fraction of total asthma flares. Other viruses that are less frequently associated with wheezing and exacerbations of asthma include bocavirus, 37 metapneumovirus 38 and coronaviruses. 39 Together, these studies provide evidence of a strong relationship between viral infections, particularly those associated with RV, and acute exacerbations of asthma.",

            "text": "The nature of the association between asthma and sinusitis in children (and adults) has been the subject of debate for many years. Much of the difficulty in defining this relationship results from the uncertainties in making the clinical diagnosis of sinusitis, because the signs and symptoms of sinusitis in children overlap with many common childhood respiratory disorders, including the common cold, allergic rhinitis and asthma. As reviewed in Chapter 26, untreated sinus disease may contribute to unstable asthma control in some patients. Because bacterial infections are clearly involved in acute and chronic sinus disease, the mechanisms by which these microbes may promote hyperreactivity in the lower airway have been of great interest. These relationships are covered in depth elsewhere in this text and therefore are not further reviewed in this chapter. in delineating risk is an important one. Bronchiolitis during infancy is associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of early childhood asthma; however, this risk differs by season of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis occurring during RV-predominant months (spring and fall) was associated with an estimated 25% increased risk of early childhood asthma compared with RSV-predominant (winter) months. However, the proportion of associated asthma after winter season bronchiolitis is greater than RV-predominant months because of higher rates of bronchiolitis during the RSV season. 16 Season of birth also appears relevant: children born close to the onset of the winter virus season are most prone to the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms, and this is likely due to a developmental component in relationship to the timing of the winter virus peak. 17, 18 BACTERIA It has been proposed that chronic bacterial infections or colonization with pathogenic bacteria could initiate chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, increased mucus production and ultimately asthma. 19, 20 Organisms primarily implicated in this process include Chlamydophila pneumoniae, [21] [22] [23] Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 24, 25 Streptococcus pneu moniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. 20 Studies of chronic mycobacterial or Chlamydophila infection and asthma in children have yielded conflicting results, potentially in part due to the limitations of current diagnostics. Findings of diagnostic tests in the upper and lower airways are not always concurrent, and diagnosis of infection by serology leads to inaccuracies. The role of these bacteria in acute wheezing in young children is also unclear.",

[30] [31] [32] [33] These studies of the role of microbial exposures and the microbiome in asthma inception are intriguing, and additional studies are a high priority to establish causality/protection and the specificity of these observations to asthma pathogenesis, and to define immunoinflammatory mechanisms contributing to these associations in both pediatric and adult patients.",

In fact, lower airway temperatures are conducive to RV replication down to fourth-generation bronchi and exceed 35\u00b0C only in the periphery of the lung. 45 Moreover, some RV types, including RV-C isolates, replicate equally well at 33 and 37\u00b0C. 46 ,47 RV appears to replicate equally well in cultured epithelial cells derived from either upper or lower airway epithelium. 48 Finally, RV has been detected in lower airway cells and secretions by several techniques after experimental inoculation.

In animal models, respiratory viral infections lead to a prominent expansion of mature dendritic cells in the lung. 63 Significantly, pulmonary dendritic cells express high levels of Toll-like receptors, and secrete large amounts of interferons in response to viral infection. Dendritic cell interferon responses are impaired in early life, which likely contributes to increased susceptibility to viral infections in infancy. 64 Acute respiratory viral infections are often accompanied by pronounced neutrophilia of upper and lower respiratory secretions, and products of neutrophil activation contribute to airway obstruction and lower airway symptoms. For example, neutrophil elastase can up-regulate goblet cell secretion of mucus. 65 P2X7 is a cation channel expressed by leukocytes and airway epithelial cells that is important to pathogen control and neutrophilic inflammation. Attenuated P2X7 function, which is common in mild to moderate asthma, is associated with reduced recruitment of neutrophils to the airway during RV colds, and an increased risk of acute asthma symptoms. 66 Lymphocytes are recruited into the upper and lower airways during the early stages of a viral respiratory infection, and it is presumed that these cells help to limit the extent of infection and to clear virus-infected epithelial cells. This is consistent with reports of severe viral lower respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. 67 B cell responses to respiratory viruses also serve to limit duration and severity of illness, as indicated by the finding of frequent and prolonged viral illnesses in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. 68 ",

Moreover, in studies that have been conducted in this age group, the results are conflicting. [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] Limitations of these studies include inclusion of multiple who develop both risk factors in early life are at highest risk for subsequent asthma. 2, 91 There is convincing evidence to implicate respiratory allergy as a risk factor for wheezing with common cold infections later on in childhood. In studies conducted in an emergency department, risk factors for developing acute wheezing episodes were determined. 85, 92, 93 Individual risk factors for developing wheezing included detection of a respiratory virus, most commonly RV, positive allergen-specific IgE and presence of eosinophilic inflammation. Notably, viral infections and allergic inflammation synergistically enhanced the risk of wheezing, and higher levels of allergen-specific IgE conferred the greatest risk. This synergism may be particularly notable for RV-C. 14 There are multiple mechanisms by which viral infections are thought to interact with allergic inflammation in order to lead to airway dysfunction, wheezing and asthma exacerbations. 94 First, viral infections can damage the barrier function of the airway epithelium, leading to enhanced absorption of aeroallergens across the airway wall and enhanced inflammation, while allergic inflammation may also lead to enhanced viral replication. 95, 96 Next, allergic inflammation enhances airway responsiveness to RV. 97 There is also significant evidence that allergic asthmatic individuals have impaired antiviral responses as noted above. Furthermore, allergen exposure and highaffinity IgE receptor cross-linking has been shown to impair virus-induced type I and III interferon production in peripheral blood cells. 98, 99 This may lead to both enhanced viral replication and also type 2 inflammation. 100,101",

Therefore, a 1-year randomized, double-blind comparison among intermittent treatment with high-dose ICS, a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast) and scheduled albuterol (so-called 'standard of care') was conducted in preschool children with histories consistent with this type of respiratory pattern. 120 Therapy was initiated by the family, based on the participant achieving a symptom profile threshold that the child had exhibited in the past that would usually foreshadow the development of more significant lower airway involvement. After 1 year of treatment, the three groups did not differ in proportions of episode-free days (primary outcome), oral corticosteroid use, healthcare utilization, quality of life or linear growth. However, during respiratory tract illnesses, both ICS and montelukast therapy led to modest reductions in trouble breathing and interference with activity scores compared to those children only treated with albuterol. These differences were significant only in those children with a positive asthma predictive index prior to enrollment. In a post hoc analysis, similar findings were obtained when the cohort was stratified by oral corticosteroid use (0 vs \u2265 1 course) during the year preceding participation in the trial.",

Inclusion of a placebo group was not permitted by the various human subjects committees of the clinical centers participating in this wheezing phenotypes, 116, 118 relatively small sample sizes, poor adherence to study medication and protocol in the outpatient studies, 115, 118 and episodes of relatively mild severity in both outpatient and inpatient studies. 115, 118 A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared a 5-day course of oral prednisolone (10 mg once a day for children 10-24 months of age and 20 mg once a day for older children for a total of 5 days) with placebo in over 650 children between the ages of 10 months and 60 months. The primary outcome, the duration of hospitalization, was no different between the treatment groups. 116 An accompanying editorial for this published study challenged the clinical research community to conduct additional prospective trials to clearly establish the efficacy of oral corticosteroid treatment of these 'asthma-like' episodes in preschool children. 119 To address these concerns further, the Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) network investigated whether oral corticosteroids reduced symptom scores during acute lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) in preschool children with recurrent wheeze. The investigators performed post hoc and replication analyses in two outpatient cohorts of children 120,121 aged 1 to 5 years with episodic wheezing that had participated in previous CARE-conducted studies. 122 Comparisons were made of symptom scores during LRTIs that were or were not treated with oral corticosteroids, adjusting for differences in disease and episode severity. The primary outcome was the area under the curve of total symptom scores among the more severe episodes. In both of the two cohorts studied independently, oral corticosteroid treatment did not reduce symptom severity during acute LRTIs. Moreover, subgroups of children who might have been more likely to experience benefit, such as those with asthma risk factors (positive modified asthma predictive index, 123 personal eczema and/or family history of asthma), did not appear to have a greater benefit than those without such characteristics. The investigators emphasized, however, that these results were hypothesis generating and needed to be confirmed in randomized prospective studies. 124 Taken together, however, these studies indicate that acute asthma-like episodes of airway obstruction in preschool children appear to respond less well to oral corticosteroid administration than do similar episodes in older children and adults.",

Treatment was for 2 years followed by a 1-year observation period off all study medication. The primary outcome measure was episode-free days. During the active treatment phase, children receiving inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) had a significantly increased number of episode-free days. In addition, they had seasonal variation in exacerbation rates, with the summer months having less frequent exacerbations and no observed treatment effects.

In contrast, in a follow-up study in children 3 to 24 months of age conducted over a period of 24 weeks, montelukast treatment did not alleviate post RSV-induced respiratory tract symptoms. 135 In school-aged children, montelukast has been shown to be less effective compared to inhaled corticosteroid treatment in reducing the need for oral corticosteroid use and time to treatment failure over a 1-year time period. 131 Both of these outcomes could be considered surrogates for respiratory pathogen-induced asthma exacerbations or worsening of overall asthma control.",

In addition, leukotrienes are released during acute asthma episodes. As a result of the potential for these mediators to influence airway tone, inflammatory cascades and mucus secretion, antagonists for their receptors have been developed and extensively studied. The cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast, has been the most frequently studied in both preschool and school-aged children. 120, [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] In one of the initial clinical trials designed to primarily evaluate safety, patients aged 2 to 5 years were treated for over 12 weeks with montelukast administered as a 4-mg chewable tablet. 129 Efficacy outcomes were also evaluated secondarily. Compared with placebo, montelukast produced significant improvements in multiple parameters of asthma control including: daytime asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, trouble breathing and activity limitation); overnight asthma symptoms (cough); the percentage of days with asthma symptoms; the percentage of days without asthma; the need for beta-agonist or oral corticosteroids; physician global evaluations; and peripheral blood eosinophils. The clinical benefit of montelukast was evident within 1 day of starting therapy. Improvements in asthma control were consistent across age, sex, race and study center, and whether or not patients had a positive in vitro allergen-specific IgE test.",

Over 12 months of therapy, montelukast significantly reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 31.9% compared with placebo. The average rate of exacerbation episodes per patient was 1.60 episodes per year on montelukast compared with 2.34 episodes on placebo. Montelukast also delayed the median time to first exacerbation by approximately 2 months and the rate of inhaled corticosteroid courses compared with placebo. Unfortunately, treatment did not reduce the necessity for oral corticosteroid administration. One of the remarkable aspects of this trial was the marked narrowly focussed intervention for type I hypersensitivity. In a placebo-controlled trial of guidelines-based asthma treatment compared to omalizumab added to standard therapy, omalizumab prevented the seasonal increases in exacerbations during the fall and spring, which are peak times for viral exacerbations (Figure 31-1) . 158 Analysis of viruses in nasal secretions during a subset of exacerbations confirmed that the treatment group had fewer viral and nonviral exacerbations. This study provides direct evidence that IgE-mediated inflammation contributes to the risk of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. These observations indicate that interactions between allergic sensitization (antigen-specific IgE antibody formation) and viral respiratory illnesses play an important role in asthma control. Finally, it will be of interest to determine whether other drugs targeting specific type-2 cytokines (e.g. mepolizumab and IL-5) 159 can also reduce the risk of virus-induced exacerbations.",

Nonetheless, oral antibiotics are frequently prescribed for wheezing illnesses in preschool children (650 antibiotic prescriptions/1,000 wheezing children). 160 Furthermore, recent data indicate that 28% of preschool children who make a physician visit for wheezing receive a prescription for an antibiotic within 2 days of the visit, and 77% receive a prescription for an antibiotic within 7 days. These prescriptions are dominated by azithromycin, the use of which increased 15-fold between 1995 and 2001. 160 As noted previously, bacteria (either alone or in combination with viral pathogens) have now been demonstrated to potentially play a role in acute wheezing episodes and increases in asthma symptoms in children. 27, 84 These observations might be an explanation as to why antibiotic administration has been observed to provide some clinical benefit by practitioners. Recent findings indicate that certain antimicrobials may have and both RV and RSV are obvious targets. Attempts at developing an RSV vaccine have so far been unsuccessful; however, recent data have provided renewed encouragement. 142, 143 Unfortunately, vaccination to prevent RV infection is even more challenging due to the large number of serotypes.

[144] [145] [146] Anti-ICAM-1 and soluble ICAM-1 were developed to prevent binding of major group viruses to their receptor. [147] [148] [149] Capsid binding agents that bind to the VP1 pocket and inhibit viral binding and/or uncoating [150] [151] [152] have shown modest antiviral effects and efficacy in clinical trials. 153, 154 An inhibitor to the 3C protease (rupintrivir) also showed broad anti-HRV activity in vitro and efficacy in clinical trials. 155 Unfortunately, these antiviral approaches have not so far led to development of a clinically useful medication. The molecules tested to date have been limited by combinations of modest efficacy, side-effects and/or drug interactions. 156 Another new approach has been to boost antiviral defenses in the lung with inhaled IFN-\u03b2. In a randomized study, subjects with persistent asthma and a history of exacerbations with colds were treated with either nebulized IFN-\u03b2 or placebo within 24 hours of the onset of cold symptoms. 157 In the intent-to-treat population, there were no significant effects on the asthma symptoms scores (which was the primary outcome) but IFN-\u03b2 treatment improved recovery of peak expiratory flow. Notably, IFN-\u03b2 was well tolerated and also induced expression of innate antiviral effectors in the blood and sputum. In a subgroup analysis of study subjects with more severe asthma (British Thoracic Society Step 4 and 5), colds were associated with increased symptoms in the placebo group but not in IFN-\u03b2treated subjects. These exciting new findings, if confirmed, suggest that inhaled IFN-\u03b2 used at the first sign of a cold could be a useful adjunct to standard therapy in patients with more severe asthma.",

The first trial studied the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial: 429 otherwise healthy preterm (33-35 weeks' gestational age) infants were randomly assigned to receive either monthly palivizumab injections or placebo during the RSV season. The prespecified primary outcome was the total number of parent-reported wheezing days in the first year of life. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken during respiratory episodes for viral analysis. Palivizumab treatment resulted in a relative reduction of 61% in the total number of wheezing days during the first year of life (1.8% vs 4.5% in the placebo group). During this time, the proportion of infants with recurrent wheeze was 10 percentage points lower in patients treated with palivizumab (11% vs 21%). As discussed above, the data generated thus far cannot ascertain what effect such treatment may have on the subsequent development of asthma in later childhood.",

They found that this treatment intervention did not further improve asthma control. Although there was an improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness with clarithromycin, this benefit was not accompanied by improvements in other secondary outcomes. 172 One additional study suggested that some benefit might be possible following intervention with this antimicrobial class. Johnston et al administered the ketolide telithromycin (a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin) for 10 days to adults with asthma seen within the first 24 hours of acute asthma episodes. This intervention resulted in significant improvements in symptom scores and lung function over the next 7 days relative to placebo. 173 However, there was no relationship between bacteriologic status and the response to telithromycin treatment, suggesting a mechanism of action unrelated to the antimicrobial properties of telithromycin.",

Viral infections, particularly those caused by RV, are associated with neutrophilic inflammation and increased IL-8 expression. 163 Neutrophils are the predominant inflammatory cell at the onset of most infections, 164 including those with RV, 163, 165 and although many chemoattractants participate in summoning neutrophils to the site of infection, IL-8 seems to play a central role. 166 Neutrophils are relatively insensitive to the therapeutic effects of corticosteroids 167 but, interestingly, azithromycin has been demonstrated to attenuate immunoinflammatory responses and may reduce the ensuing destructive neutrophilic inflammation. In addition, recent data demonstrated that azithromycin reduces RV replication and increases interferon gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells. 168 These effects may have substantial clinical relevance, as recent studies have demonstrated that primary bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics have deficient ex vivo induction of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb after infection with RV, 81 and the levels of IFN-\u03bb were inversely related to severity of RV-induced asthma exacerbations in terms of decline in FEV 1 and viral load. These findings are especially important because, in children, viral infections have been shown by many investigators to be a major etiologic agent in episodes of clinically significant lower respiratory tract symptoms. 3, 92, 169 In contrast to in vitro observations indicating a potential useful role of these agents in treating infection-induced loss of asthma control or exacerbations, their efficacy in humans has not been consistently shown. Black et al were one of the first groups to demonstrate a potential beneficial effect. They studied the effect of roxithromycin in subjects with asthma and immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgA antibodies to Chlamydophila pneu moniae. Subjects were randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with roxithromycin or placebo. This intervention led to improvements in asthma control but the benefit was not sustained. 170 Kraft and colleagues performed an additional study using a different antimicrobial.
