Whether the presence of a specific coinfectious organism is neutral, antagonistic, or synergistic in interaction with Pc has been largely unaddressed.

PVM andPc were identified on serial sections of infected scid lung by capillary gap technology using a robotic immunohistochemistry workstation (9) (Code-On; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).

Sections were then incubated for 30 rain with biotinylated goat anti-rat Ig, then streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase (SA-HPO; Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL), and finally with chromagen 3-amino, 9-ethylcarbazole (AEC; Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Pc was revealed (without trypsinization) on adjacent serial sections by 30-rain incubations with polyclonal mouse anti-Pc (10), biotinylated goat anti-mouse Ig r, and finally SA-HPO and AEC as above. Stained slides were viewed and representative fields were digitized using an Olympus research microscope equipped with a Sony DXC-930 CCD color video camera and a Macintosh Ilci computer with a Scion LG-3 8-bit grayscale frame grabber (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Acquisition and initial manipulation of the images were done using the public domain National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image 1.47 program written by W. Rasband (available by anonymous Interuet FTP from ziplv.nimh.nih.gov ). The superimposed images of PVM-and Pc-stained tissue (from adjacent serial sections of a dually infected scid lung; see Fig. 2 ) were produced by merging the NIH Image-produced TIFF files using Adobe Photoshop followed by printing on a ColorTone dye-sublimation printer (GCC Technologies, Bedford, MA).",

PVM, alone among the microorganisms tested, caused an increase in the density of Pc organisms, an increase in the severity of histopathologically defined PCP, and earlier morbidity than those ofscid mice not coinfected. The uniqueness of PVM's influence is suggested by the observations that MHV-Y, SV, and Pp were infective and caused morbidity but did not increase the density of Pc or augment the severity of PCP. Coinfection with human RSV was not detrimental to scid mice. That scid mice (deficient in both ceU-mediated and humoral immunity) were readily infected with PVM (considered an apathogenic virus) is not surprising based on earlier studies of the respiratory disease produced in T cell-deficient nude (nu) mice singularly challenged with PVM (12) .

PVM infection of an immunocompromised host has marked intraalveolar hemorrhage and substantial fibrin deposition, whereas PCP typically has an extensive intraalveolar accumulation of trophozoite-rich foamy matrix. It should be emphasized that all dually infected scid mice necropsied had typical PCP pathology. The hallmarks of PVM infection were seen only in diminished form in less than a quarter of the cases. At present, we can only speculate regarding the possible mechanisms underlying the synergism of PVM and Pc. We demonstrated that PVM and Pc were diffusely scattered throughout the lung parenchyma, but only infrequently colocalized. Thus, a contact-dependent effect of PVM on enhancing the proliferation of Pc organisms seems unlikely. The possibility that PVM could sufficiently alter the biochemical microenvironment (pH, metabolic factors, etc.) to the benefit of Pc should be considered. Alternatively, PVM may detrimentally affect the number or function of alveolar macrophages, the principle means of controlling Pc organisms in scid mice. Since macrophages are dominant in the inflammatory responses to both Pc and FVM, infection by PVM may saturate the capacity for production, immigration, or activation of these phagocytes, resulting in increased numbers of Pc. Also, as morbidity in PCP seems to be related to pulmonary (c).",

In support of this scenario, we have previously shown that scid mice have heightened morbidity due to the hyperresponsiveness of macrophages after the transfer of immunocompetent Pc-sensitized CD4 + T cells (10) . Finally, the nonspecific host response to PVM may lead to an altered balance of cytokines critical to the anti-Pc response. For example, TNF-o~ produced by alveolar macrophages has been reported to play a major role in the control of PCP in AIDS patients (19) . Human (and bovine) RSV (HRSV) and PVM are classified by morphological criteria as unique members of the genus Pneumovirus (20) but are reported to either share (21) or not share (22) antigenic surface determinants. Recent molecular studies have shown weak homology between proteins coded by genes 1 and 2 of PVM and analogous genes 1C and 1B of HKSV (23) . Thus, the fatal synergism of PVM and Pc described here may or may not be predictive of similar consequences in HRSV-Pc dual infections in immunodeficient (e.g., AIDS) patients.",
