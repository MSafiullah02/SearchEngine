            "text": "The benzimidazole scaffold is a structural isostere of naturally occurring nucleobases. Many approved drugs bear a benzimidazole ring as their main unit or important substructure [1,2]. Benzimidazole-based agents are also considered for antimicrobial purposes, such as antituberculosis, antiprotozoan or antiviral activities [3,4]. Maribavir, a benzimidazole riboside with strong activity against cytomegalovirus (HCMV), is undergoing Phase III evaluation (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02927067 and NCT02931539) (Figure 1). Different substitutions on the benzimidazole nucleus of maribavir were reported to entail activity against flaviviruses, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5]. Besides, a few non-nucleoside benzimidazole derivatives interfering with RSV F protein-mediated fusion, namely, JNJ-2408068 (R-170591), BMS-433771 and TMC353121, have reached a far stage of (pre)clinical development, but have been halted after a negative outcome [6,7] (Figure 1). Two FDA-approved inhibitors of the HCV NS5A protein, pibrentasvir and velpatasvir, contain a benzimidazole nucleus (Figure 1). The benzimidazole derivative B5, under clinical evaluation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, was shown to delay HCV infection in a humanized mouse model [8] (Figure 1). The literature further contains examples of other benzimidazole derivatives with activity against unrelated viruses, such as influenza virus or poliovirus.",

Compounds containing this structure may interfere with processes that are essential for microbe survival, such as deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, bacterial cell wall synthesis or maintenance of thiol content [9,10]. Interest in their antiviral properties dates back to the discovery of methysazone (Marboran\u00ae), which was used to treat smallpox prior to its global eradication [11]. More recent studies have reported activity against other poxviruses, herpes simplex virus or influenza virus [12]. Transformation of some 5-acetyl-2-phenylbenzimidazoles into the corresponding (thio)semicarbazone analogues yielded new agents with activity against HCV and the related bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [13]. Inhibition of the BVDV RNA polymerase was reported for 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone-derived thiosemicarbazones [14].",

Indeed, on the 1H NMR spectra our compounds do not exhibit the signal at 4.00 ppm, attributable to \u2013SH proton, suggesting that the thione form is the only tautomer. The Schiff base of our thiosemicarbazone moiety acquires E isomerism since the hydrazinic proton (-C(=S)NH-N=) falls in the 9\u201312 ppm range [22]. In fact this signal appears at ca 10.18 ppm, whilst the thioamide protons (-C(=S)NH2) exhibit two different chemical shifts at ca 8.25 ppm and 7.94 ppm. The same consideration can be made for semicarbazones with the exception of the signal of amide group (CONH2) which appears as a broad singlet (ca 6.50 ppm) with the two protons being indistinguishable. The different behaviors of the two series may be explained by the restricted free rotation brought about by the formation of the carbon\u2013nitrogen double bond character relative to thione-thiol tautomerism [23]. In addition, it is noteworthy that the sulfur atom of the thione tautomer has a greater atomic radius than oxygen atom of the corresponding semicarbazone, thereby making the thioamide protons magnetically different for steric hindrance.",

Accordingly, compound 19 exhibited a comparable docking mode with that of the analogue 21, lacking the key contacts with F137 at the thiosemicarbazone moiety or amine chain group (Figure S2).

Fouchier, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) were tested in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, a kind gift from M. Matrosovich (Marburg, Germany). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; strain Long) was evaluated on human epithelial type 2 cells (Hep-2), and human coronavirus 229E was assessed on human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast cells (all from ATCC). For the other viruses, we refer to our previous report [25]. Semiconfluent cultures of MDCK, Hep-2, Vero or HEL cells in 96-well plates were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 100 CCID50 (50% cell culture infective dose). At the same time, serial compound dilutions were added. The plates were incubated (at 35 \u00b0C for influenza and coronavirus, and at 37 \u00b0C for the other viruses) for 4 to 6 days, until full-blown cytopathic effect (CPE) was visible. At that time, microscopy was performed to score the viral CPE and compound cytotoxicity (assessed in mock-infected plates). Next, the MTS cell viability reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega) was added, and after 3 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the OD490nm values were measured in a plate reader. The compounds\u2019 EC50 (50% antivirally effective concentration) values were calculated by interpolation using semi-log dose response curves. For the MTS data, the percentage of protection against virus was defined as: ((ODCpd)virus \u2212 (ODContr)virus))/((ODContr)mock \u2212 (ODContr)virus) \u00d7 100, where (ODCpd)virus is the OD for a given concentration of the compound in virus-infected cells; (ODContr)virus is the OD for the untreated virus control; and (ODContr)mock is the OD for the untreated mock-infected control. The values for CC50 (50% cytotoxic concentration) were also calculated by interpolation using semi-log dose response curves. The percentage of cytotoxicity was defined as: (1 \u2212 (ODCpd)mock/((ODContr)mock) \u00d7 100, where (ODCpd)mock is the OD for a given concentration of the compound in mock-infected wells.",

            "text": "All the compounds were built, parameterized (Gasteiger-Huckel method) and energy minimized within MOE using MMFF94 forcefield [34]. All ligands were used in their protonated state. Docking calculations within the X-ray structure of RSV F protein (pdb code = 5KWW) were done using the LeadIT 2.1.8 software suite (www.biosolveit.com) including the FlexX scoring algorithm, which is based on binding free energy calculations by means of Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation [35,36,37]. The software detects the binding site defining a radius of 10 \u00c5 far from the co-crystallized ligand, in order to set up a spherical search space for the docking approach. The standard settings for the docking strategy were followed, choosing the so-called hybrid approach (enthalpy and entropy criteria); the related scoring function evaluation is described in the literature [38]. The derived docking poses were prioritized by the score values of the lowest energy pose of the compounds docked to the protein structure. All ligands were refined and rescored by assessment with the algorithm HYDE, included in the LeadIT 2.1.8 software. The HYDE module considers dehydration enthalpy and hydrogen bonding [39,40]. Finally, the reliability of the selected docking poses was assessed using a short ~1 ps run of molecular dynamics (MD) at constant temperature, followed by an all-atom energy minimization (LowModeMD implemented in MOE software). This represents a conformational search method that uses implicit vibrational analysis to focus a MD trajectory along the low-mode vibrations [41,42,43]. This has the effect of searching for minima along the valleys and troughs on the potential energy surface, thereby performing an exhaustive conformational analysis of the ligand\u2013receptor binding site complex, as we previously discussed about other case studies [44,45,46].",

Acute viral respiratory illnesses are usually the result of infections with a heterogeneous group of respiratory viruses, including some of the most notable RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, coronavirus and RSV. The relative infections continue to cause frequent morbidity, and sometimes cause severe outcomes, including about 3.9 million deaths worldwide each year, particularly among children under five years, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals [47,48].

It is worth noting that, although the efficacy against human coronavirus (229E) is moderate, these compounds are the first benzimidazole derivatives to be found as active against this virus. Their chemical optimization might acquire greater importance in light of the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); WHO is calling for the urgent setting up of a complex network of strategies, which also look for accelerating the development of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics to contain the pandemic proportion of 2019-nCoV infections [49].",

In particular, with the aim of obtaining more effective and drug-like anti-RSV agents, the design process will be driven by the previously built CoMFA and CoMSIA models, filtering tools predicting the safety trend of any new analogue prior to synthesis [19].
