            "text": "Motion estimation is an important component of video codecs and various applications in computer vision. Especially in video compression the compact representation of motion fields is crucial, as modern video codecs use them for inter frame prediction. In recent years compression methods relying on diffusion-based inpainting have been becoming an increasingly competitive alternative to classical transform-based codecs. They perform particularly well on piecewise smooth data, suggesting that motion fields can be efficiently represented by such approaches. However, they have so far not been used for the compression of motion data. Therefore, we assess the potential of flow field compression based on homogeneous diffusion with a specifically designed new framework: Our codec stores only a few representative flow vectors and reconstructs the flow field with edge-aware homogeneous diffusion inpainting. Additionally stored edge data thereby ensure the accurate representation of discontinuities in the flow field. Our experiments show that this approach can outperform state-of-the-art codecs such as JPEG2000 and BPG/HEVC intra.",

As both methods are not designed to handle float-valued pixel data, we quantise the input flow fields to integer values in the range {0, ..., 255} with the uniform quantisation described in Section III. We also use these quantised flow fields as input to our method. As an implementation of JPEG2000 we choose Kakadu [21] and use the original implementation of Fabrice Bellard [5] for BPG. We select two ground truth flow fields of the MPI Sintel Flow Dataset [22] as test images. This provides us with high quality flow fields with realistic complexity. We choose a simple flow field of the scene alley1 and a more complex one of the scene market2 shown in Fig. 3 . To optimise the parameters of our approach we perform a simple grid search. We fix the standard deviation \u03c3 in the edge detection step to 0.5 as this gives good results for sharp edges. Fig. 4 shows the results for JPEG2000, BPG, and our edgeaware approach for a compression ratio of 400 : 1. Note that the compression ratio is computed relative to the quantised input flow fields. Transform-based codecs like JPEG2000 have problems preserving sharp edges. This results in unpleasant wave-like artefacts around object boundaries. BPG performs much better than JPEG2000 in preserving edges, but still blurs boundaries slightly. In contrast, our edge-aware homogeneous diffusion inpainting reconstructs all important edges very well.",

A concrete implementation with straightforward edge detection achieves a remarkable quality and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors such as JPEG2000 and BPG. This shows the significant potential of inpainting-based compression for motion data. The modular nature of our framework allows to adapt and improve our method by simply changing the different components. For example, more advanced edge detection or even segmentation might improve the quality of our method for flow fields with blurry edges.",
