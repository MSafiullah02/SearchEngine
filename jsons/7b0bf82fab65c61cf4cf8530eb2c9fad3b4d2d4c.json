            "text": "1. We present data on the temporal dynamics of six viruses that infect lions (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. These populations have been studied continuously for the past 30 years, and previous research has documented their seroprevalence for feline herpesvirus, feline immunode\u00aeciency virus (FIV), feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus (CDV). A seventh virus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), was absent from these animals. 2. Comprehensive analysis reveals that feline herpesvirus and FIV were consistently prevalent at high levels, indicating that they were endemic in the host populations. Feline calici-, parvo-and coronavirus, and CDV repeatedly showed a pattern of seroprevalence that was indicative of discrete disease epidemics: a brief period of high exposure for each virus was followed by declining seroprevalence. 3. The timing of viral invasion suggests that dierent epidemic viruses are associated with dierent minimum threshold densities of susceptible hosts. Furthermore, the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during disease outbreaks was positively correlated with the number of susceptible hosts at the beginning of each outbreak. 4. Examination of the relationship between disease outbreaks and host \u00aetness suggest that these viruses do not aect birth and death rates in lions, with the exception of the 1994 outbreak of canine distemper virus. Although the endemic viruses (FHV and FIV) were too prevalent to measure precise health eects, there was no evidence that FIV infection reduced host longevity.",

In general, viruses that show low pathogenicity and prolonged infectious-ness are likely to exhibit relatively high and constant prevalence (Anderson & May 1979a ) and can therefore be termed`endemic.' In contrast, viruses that spread rapidly, have a shorter duration of infectiousness and cause higher host mortality (or immunity) are more likely to generate discrete epidemics (Anderson & May 1979b) . Epidemic diseases are characterized by rapid changes in the prevalence of infection and may disappear from the host population for extended periods. Such pathogens are likely to require high host densities for invasion and persistence, and the extent of outbreaks should increase with the size of the susceptible host population (May 1983; Onstad & Carruthers 1990; Anderson & May 1982; Jaee et al. 1992) .",

For example, canine distemper virus (CDV) killed over 70% of the last remaining colony of freeliving black-footed ferrets (Thorne & Williams 1988) and phocine distemper killed over 18 000 harbour seals in northern Europe (Osterhaus & Vedder 1988) . Rabies has been suggested to cause population decline in wolves, Ethiopian wolves and African wild dogs (e.g. MacDonald 1980; Kat et al. 1995; Weiler, Garner & Ritter 1995; Sillero, King & MacDonald 1996; Ballard & Krausman 1997; Laurenson et al. 1998) . Perhaps the best-studied example is the canine distemper virus (CDV) outbreak that struck the Serengeti lions and several other species in late 1993\u00b1early 1994 (Roelke-Parker et al. 1996 ; also see Alexander & Appel 1994; Alexander et al. 1995) . CDV originated from the large population of domestic dogs surrounding the Serengeti ecosystem and killed 35% of the Serengeti lions within 6 months. Over 85% of the lions were infected, and many victims showed neurological disorders, encephalitis, and pneumonia. While this outbreak followed a well-de\u00aened onset, many other viral epidemics have been inferred solely from crosssectional serological surveys (e.g. Olmsted et al. 1992; Spencer & Morkel 1993; Creel et al. 1997 ) and detailed/long-term investigations of virus\u00b1carnivore interactions are rare (Grenfell & Gulland 1995; Dobson & McCallum 1995) .",

These viruses show a variety of transmission modes, symptoms and durations of infectiousness in domestic carnivores (Table 1) . For example, both feline immunode\u00aeciency virus (FIV, a lentivirus closely associated with HIV) and feline herpesvirus permanently infect their hosts and do not elicit lasting immunity (Table 1 ). In contrast, canine distemper virus (CDV), feline calicivirus, feline coronavirus and feline parvovirus generally cause only temporary infection, although a small proportion of infected hosts may persist as asymptomatic carriers. Using serological data from two different lion populations, we \u00aerst classify these viruses as either endemic or epidemic. We estimate the timing of each epidemic by combining the temporal pattern of seroprevalence with information on the lions' ages at the time of sampling. We then examine the relationship between the extent of each epidemic, and the proportion and density of susceptible hosts in the population. Finally, we measure the impact of viral infection on lion mortality and birth rates.",

In the case of CDV, it is important to note that the lions should not be measured in isolation: CDV infected large numbers of Serengeti canids in the late 1970s and early 1980s, so the true number of susceptibles in the ecosystem should also include these other host species. Table 4 . Dates when viral epidemics are presumed to have ended.`Pattern' distinguishes between two situations;`presence/ absence' indicates that consecutive cohorts were seronegative whereas older cohorts were largely seropositive; and`stairstep' designates when consecutive cohorts were moderately seropositive, while older cohorts showed even higher seroprevalence.`Signi\u00aecance' refers to the dierence in seroprevalence between cohorts born within the 4 years prior to the endpoint vs. those born in the \u00aerst 4 years thereafter (as tested by w 2 with 1 d.f.). The 1976 parvovirus, and 1988 and 1993 coronavirus epidemics all showed the same qualitative pattern as the statistically robust outbreaks, and are therefore included in subsequent analyses. However, the 1987 calicivirus outbreak is omitted from further consideration, because only a small proportion of at-risk individuals became seropositive, and all three of these animals lived in the same pride at the edge of the study area Presence/absence P < 0\u00b4001, n = 54 Fig. 6 . Seroprevalence plotted as a function of the number of years that had elapsed after the presumed end of each epidemic. Data are restricted to animals who were alive during the putative outbreak and thus who could have been exposed to the virus. The decline in seroprevalence through time was statistically signi\u00aecant for all four viruses (CDV: T = \u00b14\u00b488, P < 0\u00b4001, n = 223, logistic regression; parvovirus: T = \u00b14\u00b481, P < 0\u00b4001, n = 277; coronavirus: T = \u00b12\u00b446, 0 = 0\u00b4014, n = 293; calicivirus: T = \u00b14\u00b431, P = 0\u00b4001, n = 240). These all remain signi\u00aecant when other age eects are included in a multivariate logisticregression analysis.",

In this analysis, we assumed that seronegative animals had never been infected between birth and the time they were sampled. We assumed that seropositive animals had been seropositive each year following the most recent outbreak for that particular virus, but we made no assumptions about their serostatus prior to the most recent outbreak. In this way, the age and serostatus of sampled lions was used not only to estimate seroprevalence in the year sampled, but also in previous years (thus reducing the random variance produced by small sample sizes). These estimates are presented in Fig. 9 , and they are broadly similar to the raw data presented in Fig. 3 . However, these estimates interpolate data for the years 1988\u00b192 (when few samples were collected) and extrapolate backwards to years before our serological samples were collected. Most important, Fig. 9 provides an approximation of the magnitude of each outbreak. For example, the 1993\u00b194 CDV outbreak struck when the population was entirely seronegative and over 85% of the population seroconverted in the course of the epidemic. In contrast, the 1990 calicivirus epidemic struck when nearly 30% of the population was seropositive for calicivirus, and seroprevalence only increased to about 50%.",

This suggests that epidemics of parvovirus and coronavirus each spread with a typical magnitude and each strike at a typical level of seroprevalence.

In domestic cats, FIV infection is permanent and in\u00aficts most mortality 3\u00b15 years after the initial infection (see Fig. 8 . Estimated number of`new' susceptibles for each virus each year in the Serengeti.`New susceptibles' only include animals that were born subsequent to an outbreak and they only remain susceptible until the next successive outbreak, whereupon further cubs contribute to the next set of new susceptibles. Table 1 ). If FIV is similarly harmful to lions, we would expect FIV+ lions to suer a shorter life expectancy than FIV\u00b1 lions of a comparable age. Note, though, that all the FIV\u00b1 animals presumably contracted the virus by their fourth birthday, and our analysis therefore contrasts the survival of animals infected early in life vs. those that would have been infected at a later age. Figure 11 shows the annual age-speci\u00aec mortality of lions according to their FIV status as yearlings (top) or as 2-year-olds (bottom). Data are plotted separately for males and females because of their contrasting life histories as subadults (Packer et al. 1988 ). FIV did not measurably increase mortality either in the short term (when FIV\u00b1 animals were presumably still uninfected) or in the long term (overall, seven FIV+ animals survived > 10 years). Although these data are too limited to detect subtle eects on mortality, we have seen no clinical signs of immune de\u00aeciency except during the CDV outbreak in 1994. CDV is immunosuppressive, but there was no association between clinical pathology and FIV status of CDV victims (Roelke-Parker et al. 1996) .

Because of high adult seroprevalence for all viruses, adult females could only have been`susceptible' to a virus if the interval between outbreaks was suciently long. This analysis is therefore restricted to seven widely-spaced outbreaks in the Serengeti and only includes young (and hence susceptible) females. Because of age-related changes in fecundity (Packer et al. 1998) , as well as medium-term ecological variations , we compare the reproductive performance of 4\u00b113-year-old females over the \u00aerst 2 years before and/or after each outbreak. As in the mortality analysis, none of the four viruses consistently in\u00aficted a signi\u00aecant loss in fecundity, although there seems to be a recurring eect of CDV (Fig. 13 ). Again, it is possible that there were strain dierences, as fecundity was slightly lowered during the 1985 parvovirus and calicivirus out-breaks. The high annual variation around the 1990 calicivirus and 1993 coronavirus epidemics is dicult to interpret and presumably re\u00afects other ecological factors (such as annual variations in prey availability, population density, and social disruption; see Packer et al. 1988) ",

Both show consistently high prevalence (Figs 1 and 2) and both appear to be relatively harmless, although it is dicult to compare the \u00aetness of infected and uninfected hosts. In domestic cats, FIV follows a similar aetiology as HIV in humans (Pedersen et al. 1987; Yamamoto et al. 1988; Torten et al. 1991 ) and, like HIV in humans, FIV appears to have infected domestic cats only recently (Rigby et al. 1993; Carpenter & O'Brien 1995) . We could \u00aend no evidence that FIV status in\u00afuenced lion mortality (Fig. 11) , nor did we observe any obvious signs of immunode\u00aeciency or clinical pathology in FIV+ individuals (but see Poli et al. 1995) . Phylogenetic analysis of FIV sequences in our study animals suggests that lions have been hosts to the virus for long periods of time (Brown et al. 1994) , and an attenuated eect from FIV infection may have arisen through a variety of co-evolutionary mechanisms (reviewed by Carpenter & O'Brien 1995) . Alternatively, studies of domestic cats suggest that FIV may be more pathogenic in individuals that are co-infected with FeLV (Courchamp et al. 1997) . Thus, the low impact of FIV in these lions may be because they are not co-infected with FeLV.",

In contrast, parvovirus required a larger number of susceptibles and infected a larger proportion of susceptibles during outbreaks. CDV is both the exception and the rule for this pattern. CDV infected numerous carnivore species in the late 1970s, as well as in 1994 (reviewed in Roelke-Parker et al. 1996; Cleaveland 1996) , so the`susceptible population' of only 75 lions in 1981 and over 200 lions in 1994 actually included uncounted numbers of susceptible canids, hyenas and other large felids.

Indeed, none of these viruses regularly in\u00aficted the same degree of mortality observed in domestic cats (Table 1) . Sequence data are only available for the 1994 CDV strain (Roelke-Parker et al. 1996) , so we cannot make similar assessments of co-evolutionary history as for FIV, nor can we comment on genetic dierences between strains of the same virus. However, strain dierences in pathogenicity have been well documented in other morbiliviruses besides CDV (e.g. rinderpest, Plowright 1982) . It is also possible that all of these viruses were harmful to some extent, but our demographic analysis was too coarse-grained to detect their eects. The timing of each outbreak was estimated retrospectively, we could not control for confounding interactions with other ecological variables, and the lions were no doubt co-infected with additional pathogens and parasites. No \u00aeeld analysis could ever provide the sort of comparisons that would be available from controlled experiments (Dobson & McCallum 1995) . Dobson & McCallum (1995) and Jaenike (1998) have shown that host populations can be limited by pathogens that in\u00afict moderate eects on host mortality and moderate to large eects on fertility. Out of all the viruses included in this study, only CDV appears to be suciently virulent to cause measurable declines in the Serengeti/Ngorongoro lion populations. CDV caused considerable mortality in 1994 and may have lowered host fertility during the 1981 and 1994 outbreaks. However, CDV entered the lion population in discrete, widely-spaced epidemics, and these epidemics have been suciently infrequent to in\u00afict lasting consequences. The Serengeti population recovered rapidly from the 1994 epidemic, regaining its former size by the middle of 1997 (Fig. 7) . Domestic dogs are the primary reservoir for CDV in the Serengeti/Ngorongoro region (Cleaveland 1996) , and the dog population has grown dramatically with the growing human population over the past 30 years, raising the prospects of more frequent, extensive, and virulent CDV epidemics in the lions and other wild carnivores. Attempts to inoculate this reservoir against CDV are currently underway (Kaare & Cleaveland 1997) .",
