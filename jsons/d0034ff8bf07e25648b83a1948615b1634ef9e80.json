A few of them, most notably cytomegalovirus, are primarily opportunistic pathogens affecting immunocompromised hosts. However, almost all of the pathogens have been associated with infections in the compromised individuals which may result in substantial morbidity and mortality. The pathology and pathogenesis of viral LRTI can involve both direct injuries by the viruses and immunopathological damages. In a number of viral pneumonias such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza caused by influenza A/H5N1 virus, there is evidence that high viral loads at the respiratory tract is associated with worse prognosis or mortality. 2, 3 Effective suppression of viral replication at an early stage of the infection would therefore be potentially beneficial. Chemoprophylaxis with antivirals has also been used in institutional settings (as in Table 2 .",

            "text": "Effective antiviral therapy for viral RTI is problematic. First, there are the inherent limitations in the number of available agents. Second, antiviral therapy is generally not recommended for healthy immunocompetent individuals because benefits on the clinical course of the disease are often limited. For example, while treatment of influenza by amantadine or neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) does shorten the duration of illness, the benefit is a mere one day if only the antiviral are given within 48 h after the onset of disease. Clinical benefits of antiviral treatment are likely to be greater in immunocompromised patients with more severe diseases. Third, early institution of antivirals is essential to limit the multiplication of viruses and the concomitant tissue damage and activation of the pro-inflammatory response. Unfortunately, unlike most of the common bacterial pathogens in which aetiological identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing can be completed within a few days and proper empirical antibacterial coverage generally covers most of the relevant pathogens, rapid viral diagnosis is only possible for a handful of agents. Although PCR and RT-PCR broadened the range of pathogens that can be detected, these are still not widely available in most routine laboratories and they usually do not offer same-day testing results. Antiviral susceptibility testing is virtually non-existent under such settings, though genotypic testing for mutations conferring resistance can be done rapidly in some centres.",

            "text": "The 51 serotypes of human adenoviruses (HAdV) are classified into six species, human adenovirus A-F. 4 Adenoviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses and they are common causes of sporadic or outbreaks of community-acquired infections such as pharyngoconjunctival fever, keratoconjunctivitis and gastroenteritis. Severe or disseminated infections are extremely rare in the immunocompetent hosts, 5 and most of these cases have been associated with immunosuppression, including bone marrow transplantation (BMT), solid organ transplantation (SOT), HIV infection and underlying malignancies. Patients could have asymptomatic viraemia or shedding of the virus in stool or urine, or they may present with pneumonia, enteritis and colitis, haemorrhagic cystitis and nephritis, hepatitis, encephalitis, myocarditis or disseminated infection. 6 In immunocompromised patients, adenoviraemia (as detected by PCR) precedes the onset of systemic infection, 7 and the persistent presence of high-level viraemia is associated with worse outcomes and death. [8] [9] [10] In paediatric BMT recipients, the presence of viraemia in serum or plasma at levels above 10 6 -10 7 copies/mL is considered to be a risk factor for severe complications. 10 In the setting of BMT, disease is more commonly seen in recipients of allogeneic transplantation, graft from unrelated donors, and among children as compared with autologous transplantation, graft from matched siblings and adults respectively. 11 Pneumonia (with or without other organ system involvement) is the presenting syndrome in 11-20% of BMT recipients who developed adenovirus infection. 11, 12 Among the adult BMT recipients, mortality due to adenovirus infection is highest in those suffering from disseminated disease with pneumonia (80%), isolated pneumonia (75%) and disseminated disease without pneumonia (50%). 12 Ribavirin, cidofovir and vidarabine have been used for the treatment of adenovirus infections. Vidarabine demonstrates in vitro activities against adenoviruses and has been used for the treatment of adenovirusassociated haemorrhagic cystitis. 13, 14 It was ineffective in the treatment of adenovirus infection in the BMT setting. 15 Ribavirin has been used for adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompromised patients delivered via oral, intravenous or nebulized routes, either alone or in combination with intravenous Ig (IVIG) or donor leucocyte infusion (in BMT recipients). [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] There are no controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the benefits of ribavirin. The major side-effect of ribavirin is haemolytic anaemia. Although clinical and virological response is seen in some patients, treatment failure is frequent and sometimes associated with increases in the plasma viral load. 15, [20] [21] [22] No significant benefit was noticed in the small number of patients who received combination therapy with ribavirin and cidofovir. 21 Susceptibility to ribavirin is not uniform among all adenovirus isolates, with only HAdV C being susceptible. 23 The susceptibility of species C is also variable depending on the cell type used for in vitro susceptibility testing.",

            "text": "Cidofovir is superior to ribavirin in the treatment of severe adenovirus infections. Unlike ribavirin, susceptibility of HAdV to cidofovir is independent of the species. 23 The most significant adverse reaction to cidofovir is nephrotoxicity which occurs in about 25% of the patients who received the drug for cytomegalovirus infection. 24 To reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity, pre-hydration therapy with normal saline and probenecid are essential before each dose of cidofovir. Concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided if possible. Although there are no randomized controlled trials to determine the efficacy of cidofovir in adenovirus infections, results from previous case series have been favourable. The response rate ranged from 62.5% to 98%. 9, 15, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The occurrence of serious nephrotoxicity appeared to be uncommon when the necessary precautions were taken and it seldom requires cessation of treatment. 24, 26 The use of IVIG in addition to other antiviral agents cannot be recommended at the moment. 27 Two approaches to anti-adenovirus therapy have been suggested. The conventional approach is to start treatment when the patient develops laboratoryproven HAdV clinical disease. Another approach is pre-emptive therapy; antiviral therapy is started in asymptomatic individuals when virological surveillance is positive for HAdV. 15 There are no clinical trials on the preferred strategy of management, although pre-emptive therapy may be preferable because commencement of antiviral therapy at the time of overt clinical disease may not offer substantial improvement. 20 There is evidence that the level of viral load in peripheral blood is correlated with the presence and severity of disease. 26 Starting antiviral treatment at a time when the viral load is still low may prevent the development of more severe disease and end-organ damage. The duration of antiviral therapy has not been standardized. Patients have to be monitored for the clinical, radiological and virological progress. It has been suggested that treatment needs to be continued until adenovirus is negative on two to three consecutive specimens previously positive for adenovirus. 11, 26 The duration is also determined by the level of immunosuppression, the severity of graft-versushost disease or the presence of graft rejection in the transplant setting.",

Few cases of pneumonitis had been reported in the immunocompetent patient complicating primary EBV infection and infectious mononucleosis. [29] [30] [31] [32] Hypoxaemia is a prominent finding in many cases. Although the aetiological role of EBV has been questioned in some earlier reports, more recent cases have documented the presence of EBV in the lungs by in situ hybridization or quantitative PCR. 30, 33 Even in the immunocompromised patients, EBV pneumonitis is rare, with cases occurring in the setting of severe aplastic anaemia, BMT or in association with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. [33] [34] [35] No recommendations on antiviral therapy of EBV pneumonitis can be made at the moment. Although acyclovir suppresses EBV shedding in vivo, no clinical benefits have been demonstrated in the treatment of EBV-associated infections such as infectious mononucleosis. In patients whose pulmonary disease is related to post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, treatment should include withdrawal of immunosuppressants and rituximab (anti-CD20). [33] [34] [35] Some patients may develop respiratory tract manifestations such as acute epiglottitis as a complication of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The treatment of EBV-related haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis involves the control of hypercytokinaemia (using corticosteroids and IVIG), immunosuppressants and chemotherapeutic agents (such as etoposides, cyclosporine A, antithymocyte globulin), with or without antiviral agents. A combination of acyclovir (3 g/day i.v.), IVIG (30 g/day for 5 days) and prednisolone (100 mg/day for 10 days) had been used with success in a patient with pneumonitis due to primary EBV infection. 31 The role of rituximab for EBV-related haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis has not been established.",

In the BMT setting, seropositivity of the transplant recipient and the presence of acute graft-versus-host disease are important risk factors while for SOT, high risk of disease is seen in seronegative recipients of organs from seropositive donors, and in patients receiving antilymphocyte globulins. The disease is very rarely reported in immunocompetent patients. 37 Histopathology of the lungs and viral culture are the gold standards for diagnosis, though in recent years the diagnosis is mainly based on other tests such as pp65 antigenaemia and quantitative PCR to determine the viral load in peripheral blood and BAL. 38 The key agents for antiviral therapy of HCMV pneumonitis are ganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir and more recently, oral valganciclovir (Table 2) . 39 The main adverse reactions to ganciclovir and foscarnet are myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity respectively. These agents can be used for prophylaxis in at-risk patients, pre-emptive therapy, and treatment of established HCMV disease. Pre-emptive therapy rather than universal prophylaxis has become a widely accepted strategy for prevention as it limits the use of antiviral agents to those who are at highest risk of developing HCMV disease, thereby reducing the potential adverse reactions and cost.",

This strategy is based on the routine monitoring for HCMV activity, usually by pp65 antigenaemia. Intravenous ganciclovir is generally used as the first-line agent, though myelosuppression can occur in 20-30% of patients. Foscarnet and cidofovir are used when the patient is intolerant of ganciclovir or when ganciclovir resistance is suspected clinically or confirmed virologically. Foscarnet has similar efficacy as ganciclovir when used for pre-emptive treatment in BMT recipients. 48, 49 Combined foscarnet and ganciclovir therapy for BMT recipients has been suggested but has not been widely used. 50 A study using half-doses of combined foscarnet and ganciclovir failed to show clinical benefits over conventional full-dose ganciclovir regimen. 51 Treatment of HCMV pneumonitis is different from other forms of HCMV disease in BMT recipients for whom high-dose IVIG (500 mg/kg q48h for 10 doses then 500 mg/kg twice a week for 8 doses) or HCMV hyperimmune globulin is often recommended in addition to antivirals. 52 The value of IVIG, however, has not been demonstrated in most series. 53 Leflunomide is an immunosuppressive agent currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It also possesses in vitro activities against HCMV and herpes simplex viruses (HSV). 54 A few BMT and renal transplant recipients had received leflunomide for the treatment of HCMV viraemia or disease (though none with pneumonitis) with resolution of viraemia and disease, though not all reports had a favourable outcome. [55] [56] [57] [58] The place of leflunomide in the treatment of HCMV requires further studies. The antimalarial compound artesunate showed in vitro and in vivo activities on HCMV. 59, 60 There is currently only one report of using artesunate for treating drug-resistant HCMV infection in a BMT recipient. 61 ",

However, with better and more widely available viral diagnostic methods, HSV is increasingly being found in LRT specimens with HSV-1 being the predominant serotype. Although HSV can be a primary respiratory pathogen causing tracheobronchitis or pneumonitis, the significance of finding HSV in LRT secretions, which can result from oropharyngeal contamination, has been controversial. 62 There are no pathognomonic clinical and radiological signs of HSV pneumonia, and clinical diagnosis is often based on a positive virological finding and exclusion of other pathogens. In the hospital setting, HSV haemorrhagic tracheobronchitis with or without pneumonitis is usually found in critically ill, severe burn or trauma patients, patients who have undergone major surgery, intensive care patients who had received prolonged mechanical ventilation (often with ARDS), and immunosuppressed patients such as those with underlying malignancies or transplant recipients. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] The incidence of finding HSV in the respiratory secretions in these situations ranged from 2% to 50%. 62 The presence of HSV in these patients has been associated with a higher mortality and more prolonged mechanical ventilation. Patients with HSV pneumonia tend to have higher viral loads in the respiratory tract and this parameter has been suggested to be useful in differentiating patients with genuine HSV infections of the lower respiratory tract. 64, 67 Clustering of cases of HSV pneumonia in intensive care units has been reported. 68, 69 Intravenous acyclovir is the drug of choice for the treatment of serious HSV infections. 62, 70 Oral valacyclovir may be considered in less severe diseases but there is little information on this agent in this setting. In the rare occurrence of acyclovir resistance, foscarnet and cidofovir may be used. 71 Cross-resistance to ganciclovir and famciclovir is usually complete in strains with thymidine kinase mutations. Treatment is usually recommended in patients with otherwise unexplained pneumonia, herpetic oral or mucocutaneous lesions, or in immunocompromised individuals with a positive virological finding.",

[79] [80] [81] Treatment of serious HHV-6 infections is similar to HCMV. In vitro, ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir are active against HHV-6, with cidofovir and foscarnet having the best antiviral selectivity index. 82, 83 Immunocompromised patients with HHV-6 diseases have commonly been treated with ganciclovir (dosages similar to that for HCMV diseases). 84 In BMT recipients, ganciclovir prophylaxis is effective in preventing reactivation of HHV-6 and is superior to acyclovir prophylaxis. 84, 85 ",

The commonest complications are secondary bacterial infection of the skin lesions and pneumonia in children and adults respectively. Symptomatic varicella pneumonia occurs in 1 in 200 000 cases in children and 1 in 200-400 healthy adults, but the incidence of asymptomatic pulmonary involvement as shown by radiological changes can be ten times commoner, with reported figures ranging from 5% to 50% of the patients. 86, 87 Varicella pneumonia is the commonest cause of death associated with varicella in adults. The mortality rate in adults is 25 times higher than that in children, and in the UK and USA, adults accounted for 54.3-64% of total deaths due to varicella. 88 The mortality rate of varicella pneumonia in healthy non-pregnant adults is 5-23%, but ranges from 35% to 40% in pregnant women with a perinatal mortality rate of up to 65%. 88, 89 Maternal mortality is highest during the third trimester. Primary infection in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy is also associated with the congenital varicella syndrome in 0.4-2% of life births. 90 Smokers, patients with chronic lung diseases and immunocompromised individuals are also at higher risk of developing varicella pneumonia and have higher mortality. At least five confirmed cases of pneumonia were caused by the vaccine strain of VZV. 91 Although there were no randomized controlled trials of antiviral treatment for varicella pneumonia, acyclovir is considered to be the drug of choice. 88, 92 Foscarnet is a possible alternative but few reported cases had received this agent. [92] [93] [94] Vidarabine is a third option and appeared to be effective in disseminated VZV infection including pneumonia. 92, 95, 96 Oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir should be avoided for this serious infection.",

            "text": "The emergence of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in late 2002 led to a global epidemic involving more than 8000 cases and a case fatality ratio of 11%. 113 Recent studies suggested that bats are probably the reservoir of a related virus and various game animals served as the amplification host before transmission to human. 114 Nosocomial transmission to health-care workers was a prominent feature during the epidemic, with 21% of all the cases being health-care workers. 113 Ventilatory support, in particular, the use of noninvasive ventilation under proper isolation facilities and appropriate antibacterial coverage to control secondary bacterial infections are essential. No randomized controlled trials have addressed the issue of optimal antiviral therapy for SARS. Based on serial viral load studies, effective antiviral therapy is important because the viral load in respiratory tract secretions is significantly correlated with subsequent organ dysfunction and death. 115, 116 These studies also showed that the viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirate peaked at 10-15 days after the onset of disease; therefore, there is potentially a window of opportunity for antiviral therapy. 117 Ribavirin was the earliest antiviral to be used for the treatment of SARS. Its in vitro activity on SARS-CoV is variable and is dependent on the cell type used. 118 Animal studies and efficacies in clinical series have been disappointing and was associated with significant adverse reactions such as haemolytic anaemia and electrolyte disturbances. 117, [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] Two other groups of compounds are more promising for the treatment of SARS. The first group is the protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir and nelfinavir. 124, 125 They inhibit the main protease 3CL pro of SARS-CoV which is crucial for viral replication. Two studies in Hong Kong using lopinavir/ritonavir plus ribavirin demonstrated more favourable outcomes as compared with a regimen using ribavirin alone. These included overall death rate, intubation rate, incidence of ARDS, nosocomial infection, rate of use and mean dose of corticosteroids, viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirate and peripheral lymphocyte count. 126, 127 The second group of potentially useful agents are interferons. 124 Several interferons were active against SARS-CoV in vitro, with interferon-b1a and -b1b being the most active. In an uncontrolled clinical trial, the use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 (a synthetic interferon-a) resulted in improvements in oxygenation and more rapid resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities. 128 Therapeutic use of convalescent plasma from SARS patients has been described. [129] [130] [131] Clinical and virological improvements were seen, including a decrease of plasma viral load from 10 5 copies/mL to undetectable levels after plasma transfusion. 131 A stock of convalescent sera from SARS patients was maintained by some centres such as the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service.",

HA and NA are the antigenic determinants of FLUAV, which form the basis for their subtype classification. Among FLUAV, there are 16 HA (H1-16) and 9 NA types (N1-9). HA mediates viral attachment and entry into host cells by binding to cellular sialic acid receptors. NA cleaves the glycosidic linkages to sialic acid on host cells and the surface of the viral particles and therefore facilitates the spread of the virions in the host.

Human infection is most commonly caused by FLUAV A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and FLUBV. Other serotypes such as A/H1N2 are less commonly seen and A/H2N2 has not been circulating in human populations for five decades. Large-scale crossspecies infection of human by AIV occurred in 1997 in Hong Kong which was caused by A/H5N1. 141 Since then, there is a steady increase in the number of cases of mainly poultry-to-human transmission in Asia and Africa, but the epicentre of the infection is now in Southeast Asia where the disease has become endemic. At the time of writing there were 382 human cases reported to the World Health Organization with 241 fatalities (case fatality rate, 63%) since 2003, with most of the cases (133) and deaths (108) being reported from Indonesia. 142 In addition, A/H5N1 has been spreading geographically to large areas of the Eurasian and African continents among the waterfowls and poultry. 143 The clinical and epidemiological features of A/H5N1 infection in humans have been reviewed elsewhere. [144] [145] [146] The typical manifestation of the disease starts with an influenza-like illness (ILI), with rapid progression to pneumonia, ARDS and multiorgan failure. Diarrhoea is seen in up to 70% of the patients. Other types of AIV have also been found to cause human infections. The A/H9N2 virus had caused mild respiratory illnesses in Hong Kong. [147] [148] [149] In the Netherlands, the A/H7N7 virus had caused a major human outbreak associated with poultry with one fatal case. 150, 151 Typical symptoms were conjunctivitis, an ILI and occasionally pneumonia. In 2004, an outbreak of human A/H7N3 infection associated with poultry occurred in British Columbia, Canada, and the symptoms were primarily conjunctivitis and an ILI. 152, 153 In addition to AIV, clinically mild human infections due to other mammalian influenza viruses, such as the swine A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses, have been reported. [154] [155] [156] Seasonal human influenza is an extremely common cause of RTI in both the community and health-care settings. The disease ranges from a febrile URTI to fulminant primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. Primary viral pneumonia is typically seen in patients with underlying comorbidities such as chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, but 25% and 13% of the cases occur in otherwise healthy adults and pregnant women respectively. The disease can be rapidly fatal in 1-4 days. There is frequently a distinct seasonal pattern in temperate countries with the peak incidence in the winter months. In tropical countries the disease may be prevalent year round or have two yearly peaks in both summer and winter months.",

            "text": "Antiviral therapy for uncomplicated influenza in the immunocompetent host is not normally necessary. The reasons include the usual delay of more than 48 h from onset of illness to medical attention, difficulties in differentiating influenza from other viral RTI, potential for antiviral resistance, cost of the medications and potential adverse reactions to the drugs. Although antiviral treatment for influenza is available, all the currently available agents must be given within 48 h (preferably 36 h or less) after the onset of illness to be effective. This can be explained by the dynamics of viral multiplication and shedding of influenza viruses. Influenza is generally a very acute infection. Incubation period of influenza is about 48 h (ranges 24-96 h), and shedding of viruses from the respiratory tract peaks at 24-72 h after infection. This means that virus shedding is already substantial even before the onset of illness. Early diagnosis of influenza is therefore crucial if antiviral therapy is going to be effective. However, specific virological diagnosis is often not available in the primary care setting. The clinical diagnosis of influenza is usually made as ILI, the definition of which also varies between different studies and surveillance programmes. Agents other than influenza viruses and the proportion of ILI cases caused by influenza viruses are affected by the seasonality of different infections. The positive predictive value of ILI for confirmed influenza varies from 30% to 87% during influenza seasons, while the figure drops to 23-30% during off-seasons. [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] Thus, antiviral treatment of influenza is usually only recommended for at-risk patients and those who develop severe disease and complications. 162 The two main groups of anti-influenza agents are the adamantanes and NAI (Table 3 ). Amantadine and rimantadine share similar clinical efficacies, the main difference is the adverse effect profile. Amantadine is noted for its neurotoxicity. Common adverse neurological effects include dizziness, confusion, disorientation, depression, seizures and insomnia. Amantadine is excreted by the kidneys. Dosage reduction is necessary in patients with renal impairment and in elderly people over 65 years of age. Amantadine is effective for prophylaxis and treatment of human influenza. When given within 48 h of onset of illness, it reduces the duration of symptoms for 1-2 days. Resistance emerges rapidly following therapeutic use of adamantanes in human influenza and the resistant viruses are fully transmissible and pathogenic. Up to 30% of patients with human influenza A being treated with amantadine may shed resistant viruses, sometimes as early as 2-3 days after treatment. The incidence of adamantane resistance among human influenza viruses (A/H3N2) is increasing in many parts of the world, especially in China. 163 For this reason, amantadine is no longer recommended as the first-line antiviral therapy for seasonal influenza. 162, 164 The efficacy of the adamantanes against AIV, in particular, A/H5N1 viruses, is unknown. There are no controlled clinical trials of any antiviral agent for the treatment of AIV infections. The prevalence of amantadine resistance among A/H5N1 viruses in poultry is very high in countries like China. 165 The situation is attributed to the extensive use of amantadine in poultry farming. 165 In Vietnam and Thailand, 95% of 638 A/H5N1 isolates are amantadine resistant. 166 Isolates of A/H5N1 from the Indochina clade in Cambodia-Thailand-Vietnam often carry mutations in the M2 gene conferring resistance to adamantanes. However, the China-Indonesia clade of viruses remains susceptible to amantadine.",

            "text": "Despite the problems and limitations, the role of adamantanes should not be completely dismissed. First, amantadine has an extremely long shelf life of over 25 years and is relatively inexpensive. Therefore, they are useful agents for stockpiling against pandemic influenza. As it is not possible to predict the nature of the viral strain responsible for future influenza pandemics, they may still have a role for therapy and prophylaxis. Second, in vitro synergistic antiviral effects were seen when rimantadine was combined with NAI. 167 Animal studies showed that when rimantadine is combined with oseltamivir for treatment of A/H3N2 infection, a synergistic effect was seen in preventing animal mortality. 168 Low-dose combinations of oseltamivir and amantadine for chemoprophylaxis against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 infection in mice were effective. 169 Against the A/H5N1 virus, a protective effect was seen when mice were challenged by the virus 24 h after receiving an amantadine-oseltamivir combination. 170 The adamantanes are commonly used in the control of institutional outbreaks of seasonal influenza. They are given to both patients or residents and staff for a minimum of 2 weeks or 1 week after the last new case appeared. 164 In the setting of influenza A outbreaks in long-term care facilities, it is important to initiate chemoprophylaxis within 5 days after the onset of the outbreak. Delayed initiation was associated with longer durations of outbreaks, higher incidence rates and case fatality rates. 171 Susceptibility to the NAI may be variable according to the different NA types of FLUAV. 172 Oseltamivir is available orally while zanamivir is available as dry powders and delivered by oral inhalation. Both NAI are effective for treatment and prophylaxis (pre-or post-exposure) of human influenza infection in clinical trials. 173 As in the case of adamantanes, when the drugs are given within 36-48 h of onset of symptoms, a mean reduction of the duration symptoms for 1-2 days can be achieved. Early administration of oseltamivir (within 12 h after the onset of symptoms) appears to increase the effectiveness of therapy for both influenzas A and B. There are differences between the response of influenzas A and B towards oseltamivir. In Japan, the clinical response to oseltamivir is lower for influenza B than influenza A in terms of a longer duration of fever. 174 The effectiveness of oseltamivir on influenza B is also lower in the 2004-2005 season compared with the 2002-2003 season. Whether this is due to antigenic variation or reduced oseltamivir susceptibility is unknown.",

            "text": "The NAI are remarkably free from major sideeffects. Reports from Japan suggested that oseltamivir might be associated with neurotoxicity in adolescents. Oseltamivir and its metabolites may have excitatory effects on the central nervous system of the rat, which may account for some of the neuropsychiatric side-effects noticed in the past few years with more widespread use of the drug. 175, 176 The safety of these agents in infants and pregnant women is unknown. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are currently approved for children over 1 and 7 years of age respectively. Limited studies from Japan showed that oseltamivir is probably safe in infants under 1 year old. 177, 178 Both oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective in animal models in preventing death and improving survival following infection by A/H5N1 viruses. Early commencement of therapy (within 48 h of infection) is critical in improving the survival of animals. The length of this window of opportunity for human AIV infection is unknown. In Thailand, patients who survived A/H5N1 infection after oseltamivir treatment appeared to have received the agent earlier than those who subsequently died (4.5 vs 9 days after disease onset). 179 Nonetheless, therapeutic efficacy of oseltamivir in human A/H5N1 infection has not been favourable. The case fatality ratio remains extremely high at 63% and up to 81% in Indonesia even though oseltamivir has been used in most patients. 142 The lack of major beneficial effects is often attributed to the late presentation of the patients to medical treatment, high initial viral loads, poor oral bioavailability of oseltamivir, lack of parenteral preparations of NAI, a cytokine storm resulting in multi-organ failure and the emergence of oseltamivir resistance.",

            "text": "Primary resistance to the NAI among wild strains of human influenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) used to be extremely rare. 180 10 mg q24h by oral inhalation for 10-28 days 10 mg q12h by oral inhalation for 5 days resistance following oseltamivir treatment occurred in 0.33-5.5% of the treated patients. [181] [182] [183] However, a worrying trend of oseltamivir resistance has been emerging. The first report came from Japan where oseltamivir resistance was encountered in up to 18% of A/H3N2 viruses from children being treated with oseltamivir. 184 In the 2004-2005 season, FLUBV with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir was detected in Japan. 185 In the 2005-2006 season in France, two human A/H1N1 isolates were found to be resistant to zanamivir, one A/H1N1 isolate was resistant to oseltamivir but susceptible to zanamivir, and an FLUBV isolate was resistant to both zanamivir and oseltamivir. 186 In the 2007-2008 season, a high prevalence of oseltamivir resistance was reported among human A/H1N1 viruses in at least nine European countries; overall, 14% of 437 strains tested were resistant to oseltamivir (range 6-70%). 187 The H274Y mutation in the NA gene is responsible for some of the cases of oseltamivir resistance seen in Europe. The emergence of oseltamivir resistance among A/H5N1 viruses is also alarming. The first case was described in a Vietnamese girl who had received 4 days of post-exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis. The level of resistance apparently did not lead to treatment failure. 188 Subsequently, two more Vietnamese patients were found to have infection due to oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 viruses. 3 In the patients who died from oseltamivirresistant A/H5N1 infections, a rising viral load was detected in their throat swabs. 189 A study involving A/H5N1 viruses of avian origins in Southeast Asia obtained in 2005 showed that while all the viruses were susceptible to zanamivir and all clade 1 isolates from 2004 were susceptible to oseltamivir, some clade 1 isolates from Cambodia and some clade 2 isolates from Indonesia in 2005 showed a 15-to 30-fold reduction in oseltamivir susceptibility. 190 Resistance to the NAI occur as a result of mutations in the NA gene of the virus. A number of mutations have been described; a common mutation is H274Y, which is found in N1 viruses and confers high-level resistance to oseltamivir. 191, 192 With few exceptions, most of the oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses (including those with the H274Y mutation) remained susceptible to zanamivir. The lack of cross-resistance between these two NAI is due to the differences in their chemical structure and binding properties to the NA molecule. 193 Oseltamivir has a hydrophobic pentyloxy substitution at the C6 position while zanamivir has a polar glycerol group. Binding of oseltamivir to the wild-type NA molecule requires a conformational change in the NA to accommodate the hydrophobic side-chain, while such a change is not necessary for the binding of zanamivir. The H274Y mutation prevents this conformational change from occurring, thereby conferring resistance to oseltamivir but does not affect the binding of zanamivir. Earlier experiments demonstrated the reduced fitness of NAIresistant viruses in vitro and in animal studies. A/H3N2 viruses with NA mutations of R292K and E119V as well as A/H1N1 with H274Y have lower transmissibility, infectivity and pathogenicity in ferrets, as well as reduced replication in vitro. [194] [195] [196] [197] However, the loss in fitness and virulence is not a uniform charac-teristic of all NAI-resistant mutants, and close monitoring for their pathogenicity is essential. 198, 199 In view of the increasing concern for oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses, relative rarity of zanamivir-resistant isolates especially among A/H5N1, and the difficulty in administering zanamivir powder to the severely ill patient, other modes of therapy need to be explored. A special preparation of zanamivir in saline was used for nebulization in a study and was well tolerated. 200 Nebulized zanamivir may improve the delivery of drugs to the LRT in severely ill patients and those put on mechanical ventilation. In preclinical trials, intravenous zanamivir has been given at very high doses to volunteers and was well tolerated. 201, 202 The availability of an intravenous formulation of zanamivir can prove life-saving in patients suffering from severe disseminated infections by yielding high drug concentrations both in the consolidated lungs and at other extrapulmonary foci of infection.",

Unfortunately, a consistent benefit has not been observed in all clinical trials and ribavirin is currently not considered to be a drug of choice for influenza. Data on the activity of ribavirin on AIV are limited. 207 An investigational agent is viramidine which is a carboxamidine analogue of ribavirin and it possesses anti-influenza activity in vitro and animal studies. 207 Convalescent plasma is another potentially useful form of therapy for severe influenza and infection due to A/H5N1. Convalescent plasma has been used in one patient with A/H5N1 infection with good clinical and virological responses. 208 A meta-analysis on the use of convalescent blood products during the Spanish influenza pandemic showed that there was a survival benefit in those who received this treatment, and the benefit was greater if treatment was begun within 4 days of onset of pneumonia. 209 Another approach to therapy of A/H5N1 infection is the use of immunomodulators in an attempt to limit the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm and the resultant tissue damage. Corticosteroids has been used in some cases but has not been shown to be beneficial. 210 A recent animal study showed that a combination of intraperitoneal zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine protects mice from a high inoculum of A/H5N1 viruses even if treatment was started 48 h after challenge. 211 To be effective, immunomodulators should be carefully chosen to target the detrimental pathways of the inflammatory cascade while preserving the protective immunity.",

            "text": "The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first described in 2001 and has a global occurrence. 221 There are two genetic lineages, A and B, in hMPV, each of which are further divided into sublineages 1 and 2. 222 Infection by hMPV is common, and most of the population would have been exposed to the virus by early adulthood. [223] [224] [225] Infection is especially common in children 3 years of age or younger. The prevalence of hMPV in children hospitalized for RTI ranged from 3% to 10%, often second only to RSV in prevalence. [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] [231] The infection manifests as fever, URTI symptoms, croup, exacerbation of asthma, bronchitis, bronchiolitis or pneumonia. 232 The disease is not clinically distinguishable from other causes of viral RTI, though the severity may be less than RSV infection. 233, 234 Community-acquired infection in immunocompetent children is usually uncomplicated. Severe pneumonia and even mortality have been reported in immunocompromised patients such as BMT and SOT recipients. 235, 236 The viral load of hMPV is correlated with the disease severity in children. 237 Infected adults may develop an ILI, exacerbation of COPD, congestive heart failure, asthma and pneumonia. A recent prospective study showed that hMPV is the cause of CAP in 4% of adults, all of whom had underlying chronic heart and/or lung diseases. 238 It was the second commonest viral respiratory pathogen in a series of adult patients with haematological malignancies with or without BMT. 235, 239 Outbreak of hMPV infection in elderly residents of a long-term care facility has also been reported. 240 Like many other clinically important paramyxoviruses, hMPV is susceptible to ribavirin. In vitro, the activity of ribavirin against hMPV is similar to RSV. 241 In a mouse model of infection, ribavirin reduced the viral load in the lungs by 5 log10 after 5 days of treatment. 242 Although controlled clinical trials have not been performed, a lung transplant recipient with hMPV pneumonia had been treated with intravenous ribavirin and its use is recommended for severe infections in immunocompromised hosts. 243, 244 Human parainfluenza viruses There are four human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) serotypes placed in two genera under the family Paramyxoviridae. These include Respirovirus (HPIV-1 and 3) and Rubulavirus (HPIV-2 and 4, also includes the mumps virus). They are enveloped, singlestranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. Most human infections are caused by HPIV-1, 2 and 3. 245 HPIV-4, which is not normally detected by rapid antigen assays, has been found to be associated with RTI and community outbreaks of RTI in recent years. [245] [246] [247] [248] Human parainfluenza viruses are very common causes of community-acquired RTI, especially in the paediatric population. Manifestations in children ranges from croup (for which HPIV are the commonest aetiological agents), bronchiolitis, tracheobronchitis, to pneumonia. 245 HPIV-1 and -2 are often associated with URTI such as croup, while HPIV-3 predominates in causing LRTI in very young infants. 245, 249 HPIV infection in adults is generally less severe and often present with URTI. However, immunocompromised individuals, both children and adults, are prone to develop severe illness as a result of HPIV infection. Severe diseases are often seen among BMT and SOT (such as lung transplant) recipients, as well as those with haematological malignancies and congenital immunodeficiencies. [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] [257] [258] Prolonged (up to 121 days) and sometimes asymptomatic shedding of HPIV from the respiratory tract of the patients has been documented, potentially adding to the risk of transmission in health-care facilities. 254, 258 Nosocomial acquisition or outbreaks of HPIV infection have also been reported among these compromised patients. 252, 253 In some studies, a high viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate is associated with symptomatic infection and severity of disease. 258 In these compromised hosts, HPIV-3 is the commonest serotype causing severe LRTI. The mortality-up to 80% or above-is highest among those who developed pneumonia. 255 The mortality of HPIV-3 pneumonia in transplant recipients used to be very high with 30-day mortality of 35%, but some other series had a much lower 30-day mortality of 4%. 254, 257 Antiviral therapy of uncomplicated HPIV infection in the immunocompetent patients is not generally indicated. HPIV pneumonia in the immunocompromised host is usually treated with antivirals. As in the case of other paramyxoviruses, HPIV are susceptible to ribavirin, which is the commonest antiviral agent used clinically for severe infections. In vitro and in animal studies, ribavirin suppresses viral multiplication and improves survival of animals. [259] [260] [261] Immunocompromised patients with serious HPIV infections are treated with ribavirin given by the intravenous or aerosolized routes, though its efficacy has not been studied in randomized controlled trials. 251, 252, 254, 262 In at least two of the case series, aerosolized ribavirin did not result in improved clinical outcomes. 254, 255 It is uncertain whether this ineffectiveness is due to the lack of in vitro activities of ribavirin against HPIV, poor penetration of the drug to the lower airways or late commencement of antiviral treatment.",

            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is one of the species in the genus Pneumovirus under the family Paramyxoviridae. The species consists of two subtypes A and B and both subtypes often co-circulate in the community at the same time. HRSV shows a seasonality with the peak incidence commonly seen in winter and early spring in temperate countries. 265, 266 The main burden of the disease is in young children in whom it is one of the more serious pathogens because of its propensity to cause LRTI such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In children, HRSV causes 50-90%, 5-40% and 10-30% of the hospitalizations for bronchiolitis, pneumonia and tracheobrochitis respectively. 267 Owing to the lack of a durable immunity, re-infection is common; the subsequent episodes are, however, less severe than the first attack. Risk factors for more severe disease in childhood include prematurity, presence of chronic lung diseases, congenital heart disease and congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies. 268 Persistent wheezing after HRSV infection is common but its role in causing asthma and atopy has not been conclusively demonstrated. HRSV is also the commonest virus causing outbreaks in paediatric wards. 265, 269 Human respiratory syncytial virus is a common but under-appreciated pathogen in the adults. In one of the studies, HRSV caused 1.0-4.4% of CAP in otherwise healthy adults, and was one of the four commonest pathogens identified. Patients with HRSV infection tend to have more wheezing and rhonchi compared with other pathogens. 270 Communitydwelling elderly and elderly individuals living in long-term care facilities have significant morbidity and mortality from HRSV infections. 271, 272 Attack rates during outbreaks in long-term care facilities ranged from 12% to 89%. In a prospective study, HRSV infection occurred in 3-7% of healthy community-dwelling elderly and 4-10% of high-risk adults, and accounted for 10.6% of hospitalizations for pneumonia. 271 In elderly patients hospitalized for HRSV infection, the length of hospital stay, rate of intensive care use and mortality are similar to influenza A. Mortality is also high in the immunocompromised patients who develop HRSV pneumonia. 273, 274 Antiviral treatment of HRSV infection is traditionally based on ribavirin. Ribavirin is often given in the nebulized form via a SPAG-2 aerosol generator. A potential problem in giving nebulized ribavirin to intubated patients is the precipitation of the drug in the tubing, thereby causing malfunction of the ventilator. Another problem associated with the use of nebulized ribavirin is the teratogenicity of the drug; pregnant or potentially pregnant health-care workers must avoid close contacts with patients on this mode of therapy. Administration of nebulized ribavirin by the high-dose short-duration regimen ( Table 1 ) may reduce environmental contamination by the drug. 275 Oral ribavirin has been used for a median duration of 16 days (range 4-64 days) in patients with haematological diseases. 276 Intravenous ribavirin has also been used in BMT and lung transplant recipients. 277, 278 The optimal duration of ribavirin is unknown, courses of 3 days to over 14 days have been used. 279 IVIG (500 mg/kg q48h) is sometimes used in the immunocompromised patients together with ribavirin. 274, 280 Although ribavirin is licensed for HRSV infection and has been shown to reduce the viral load in BMT patients, clinical trials have not been uniformly in favour of its efficacy. 281 Systematic reviews of the efficacy of ribavirin in HRSV infection in infants and young children showed a trend towards shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of hospital stay in the ribavirin-treated group. 265, 282 The current recommendation is that ribavirin should not be routinely given to patients with HRSV infection, but may be considered in high-risk patients such as the immunocompromised, those with significant comorbidities, or those with severe infections. 276, 283, 284 Corticosteroids have also been commonly used for HRSV infection. Agents such as hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, budesonide and dexamethasone have been given by mouth, by nebulization, intramuscularly or intravenously. 265 The results have been conflicting. In one of the metaanalyses, the use of corticosteroids in HRSV bronchiolitis infants lead to a statistically significant reduction of length of hospital stay-by only 0.43 day. 285 In mechanically ventilated patients, the steroid-treated patients overall tended to have a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (by 1.6 days, statistically insignificant), the benefit is most prominent in the bronchiolitis group in whom the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shortened by 4.3 days. 286 A major breakthrough in the management of HRSV infection is in immunoprophylaxis and possible immunotherapy of the disease. Immunoprophylaxis of HRSV infection in the high-risk individuals can be achieved using RSV immune globulin (RSVIG). RSVIG is given at a dose of 750 mg/kg i.v. once a month for up to 5 months during the peak HRSV season. This has been shown to be highly effective in reducing the number of RSV hospitalization, duration of hospitalization and the severity of disease. 276 The disadvantages of RSVIG being the need for intravenous infusion, the use of human blood products and the high cost of the product. RSVIG is no longer produced by its manufacturer MedImmune since 2003. Subsequently, palivizumab was developed. Palivizumab is a humanized IgG mAb against the F (fusion) protein of HRSV and it is 50-100 times more potent than RSVIG. The F protein is conserved between different strains of HRSV and it serves the pivotal function of viral fusion with cell membrane as well as intercellular spread of the virus. Palivizumab is given at 15 mg/kg once a month by intramuscular injection for 5 months, starting 2 weeks before the HRSV season is expected to begin. Significant reduction in the hospitalization rate of palivizumab-treated high-risk infants (especially the premature and those with chronic lung diseases) was seen. 287 Compared with placebo, palivizumab reduces the incidence of hospitalization due to HRSV infection by 55%, compared with 41% by RSVIG. The reduction in premature infants without bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 78% while the figure for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 39%. Palivizumab also led to a significantly reduced admission rate to intensive care, shorter duration of hospital stay and shorter duration of moderate to severe respiratory illness. RSVIG and palivizumab have also been used for therapeutic purposes in a small number of patients. 274, [288] [289] [290] [291] [292] [293] Concrete benefits of using Ig for treatment of HRSV infection is lacking. 294 Currently, another anti-RSV mAb, motavizumab, is being developed. 295, 296 Motavizumab has a much higher affinity to the F protein of HRSV than palivizumab with significantly enhanced binding to F protein and in vitro neutralization of the virus.",

The HRV-QPM strain was found to be associated with LRTI symptoms in about half of the cases and it is almost identical to the newly described species HRV-C. 311, 312 The HRV are arguably the commonest of all known viral causes of RTI. 313 Although certain months of the year are characterized by a high prevalence of particular respiratory viruses (such as the 'flu season' in temperate countries), some studies showed that year-round, HRV are the cause of the majority of acute community-acquired viral RTI. 314 Human rhinoviruses are typically stereotyped as the 'common cold viruses' because they accounted for over 50% of common colds. During the peak seasons of HRV infections-often in early spring and autumn-up to 90% of colds are due to HRV. 315 The infection is a self-limiting disease with a median duration of illness of 1 week, but a quarter of them can last for 2 weeks. It can occur in any age groups owing to the large number of serotypes. Involvement of the LRT by HRV has been less well studied until the past decade with the wider availability of better diagnostic techniques such as RT-PCR. It is now well documented that HRV causes LRTI, manifesting as bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia in both children and adults. 315, 316 They are also important causes of exacerbations in patients with chronic airway diseases such as asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis. 315 In children hospitalized for acute RTI, HRV can be detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirate in 35.4% of the individuals in one recent study, and pneumonia was diagnosed in 11.3% of the patients in that cohort. 317 Apart from the children, elderly individuals living in the community can also develop HRVassociated LRTI. 318, 319 In another series which used RT-PCR to detect the viruses, HRV accounted for 57% of episodes of viral RTI among the elderly individuals in whom an aetiological agent was found. In the majority of these cases, HRV were the sole pathogens found. 318 Symptoms of LRTI were noted in 62.5% of the individuals. HRV are also important respiratory pathogens in the immunocompromised hosts, in particular the transplant recipients. 315, 320 Patients who developed HRV pneumonia appeared to have a poor prognosis with 100% mortality reported in a series of BMT recipients. 320 While not as commonly reported as influenza viruses or HRSV as a cause of nosocomial infection, HRV has been associated with outbreaks in hospitals which can lead to substantial mortality in the compromised populations. 321, 322 No antiviral agent is currently licensed for the treatment of HRV infections. One of the earlier and more successful trials used intranasal interferon a-2 for rhinoviral colds. In double-blind placebo controlled trials involving healthy volunteers, the use of intranasal interferons were shown to be effective for prophylaxis in experimental infections with HRV. [323] [324] [325] Intranasal interferon was also effective for prophylaxis against natural infections and postexposure prophylaxis. [326] [327] [328] This mode of delivery was, however, ineffective for therapy of established infections. 329, 330 A large number of experimental agents have been tested for their anti-picornavirus activities and some had undergone early phases of clinical trials. [331] [332] [333] [334] Pleconaril is the best studied of these agents. It binds to the hydrophobic pocket in the viral capsid VP1, thereby inhibiting the attachment, entry and uncoating of the virus. 334 Pleconaril is orally bioavailable and achieves excellent penetration into body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid. In vitro, most HRV are inhibited by pleconaril but at least seven serotypes belonging to HRV-B are resistant to pleconaril. 335 Resistance is related to the amino acid sequence at the binding site of the capsid pocket. Clinical trials with pleconaril have been performed on enteroviral meningoencephalitis, myocarditis and neonatal sepsis. 336 In the double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled trials which investigated the efficacy of pleconaril for picornavirus colds in adults (in which 99% of the viruses detected were rhinoviruses), the use of pleconaril resulted in a 1.5-day reduction in the time to alleviation of illness and decreased viral load in the nasal mucus. 337 A 15-month-old leukaemia child who developed severe HRV pneumonia after BMT was being treated with pleconaril and had marked improvement clinically and radiologically. 336 Pleconaril may be the most promising agent for the treatment of severe HRV infections. Unfortunately, the drug is not yet routinely available for clinical therapy.",

            "text": "Viral RTI carry a substantial burden of disease and each pathogen shows specific clinical and epidemiological characteristics. Most of the agents are common causes of respiratory illness in the community affecting immunocompetent individuals. In this regard, the infants and children are frequently the commonest age group to develop symptomatic illness. Some are noted for their preponderance to cause severe infections in the immunosuppressed hosts (such as HCMV), while most of the rest produce more serious illnesses in the immunocompromised than the immunocompetent individuals. The influenza viruses are unique in their pandemic potential, and others are notable for having an animal reservoir (as in AIV and SARS-CoV). Nosocomial transmission of respiratory viruses is a common cause of outbreaks in hospitals and other health-care facilities. Diligent infection control measures (primarily contact and droplet precautions, with airborne precautions in some special situations) are crucial. Antiviral agents are available for some of these pathogens. The herpesviruses are often susceptible to the guanosine analogues (such as acyclovir), ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir. Ribavirin is a broadspectrum agent active on many RNA and some DNA viruses. Influenza viruses are specifically targeted by the adamantanes and NAI. The interferons deserve more intensive investigations to assess their therapeutic and prophylactic roles. Unfortunately, only a few of these agents have undergone stringent clinical trials to assess their clinical efficacies. The choice of a specific agent is often based on in vitro susceptibility and clinical experience, sometimes supported by efficacies in experimental animal models. Randomized controlled trials are, however, not always feasible, especially in life-threatening infections. Immunological agents may become an important aspect in the therapy or prophylaxis of some infections. Examples include the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of SARS and A/H5N1 infections. Palivizumab is a successful example in this respect. In general, lifethreatening infections such as HCMV pneumonitis and A/H5N1 infections must be treated with antivirals despite the lack of clinical trials in some settings. For other respiratory viruses, antiviral treatment is often recommended only for immunocompromised individuals or for severe infections in the competent host. In some viral RTI, such as SARS and avian influenza infections due to FLUAV A/H5N1, immunopathological damage or excessive activation of the pro-inflammatory cascade is thought to contribute to the organ damage and mortality. Immunomodulating agents are used for these infections in the hope of reducing these tissue damages. Corticosteroids are the most commonly used of these agents because of the potency in suppressing inflammatory reactions. However, the value of corticosteroids has not been encouraging for most of theses infections. One possibility for the lack of beneficial effects of corticosteroids could be the broad and non-specific suppressive effects on the immune system, which may also inhibit the protective cellular immunity crucial to control viral multiplication. Corticosteroids or other immunomodulators should be used only when an effective antiviral agent is available, lest the immunosuppression may lead to uncontrolled viral replication. More targeted modulation of the immune system should be explored in the future.",
