Such measures impose a hurtful toll on the economy, and are difficult to sustain for extended periods. The challenge is that selective isolation of the sick, an often viable and effective strategy, is insufficient against COVID-19, due to its relatively long incubation period, in which exposed individuals experience no symptoms, but still contribute to the spread. Here we propose an alternating lock-down strategy, in which at every instance, half of the population remains under lock-down while the other half continues to be active, maintaining a routine of weekly succession between activity and lock-down. All symptomatic individuals continue to remain in isolation. Under this regime, if an individual was exposed during their active week, by the time they complete their lock-down they will already begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the majority of exposed individuals during their asymptomatic phase. We find that this strategy not only overcomes the pandemic, but also allows for some level of flexibility, withstanding a fraction of defectors or essential workers that remain continuously active. We examine our strategy based on current epidemiological models with parameters relevant for COVID-19. We wish, however, following this communication, to further test and fine-tune our scheme based more refined data, and assess its actual effectiveness.",

Lacking therapeutic interventions, such as drugs or vaccines, we resort to social distancing, aimed primarily at lowering the reproduction rate R 0 and flattening the curve, i.e. reducing the total number of infected individuals, while spreading their infection over an extended period [1-3]. Such measures are designed to avoid shocking the health-care system, reducing the medical burden, and slowing its onset, hence keeping it within the bounds of the system's capacity. To achieve this many countries have imposed social restrictions [3], from complete lock-downs, to severe mobility constraints, indeed, slowing down the viral propagation, but at the same time, taking a sever toll on social and economic stability. Most current projections on COVID-19 indicate that such social distancing policies must be put in place for extended periods (typically months) to avoid reemergence of the epidemic once lifted [4] . This, however, may be unsustainable, as individual social and economic needs will, at some point surpass the perceived risk of the pandemic.",

We arrived at an efficient policy of an alternating lock-down, based on two principals: (i) Complete isolation of the infected individuals, as already practiced at present [3] ; (ii) Partitioning of the remaining population into two groups that undergo weekly successions of lock-downs and routine activity. Hence while group 1 remains active, group 2 stays at home and vice versa. This allows half of the population to remain active at any instance, by enabling each individual to participate in the work force and partake in social activities for half of the time. Of course, at all times, infected individuals, who already exhibit COVID-19 symptoms should remain in isolation, regardless of their group affiliation. It is also crucial that the partition is at a household level, rather than per individual (e.g., based on address), such that all people sharing the same habitat are in the same group, avoiding inter-group spillover.",

At the same time it treats one of the main obstacles for COVID-19 mitigation -the 5 day incubation period. Indeed, isolating people for, e.g., an entire week after they have been socially active, ensures that the majority of the exposed individuals are confined to their homes. To understand this consider an individual in Group 1 who was active during week 1, and therefore might have been infected. According to the proposed routine, this individual will anyway enter lock-down in week 2, and hence will be isolated precisely during their suspected incubation period. If, at the end of week 2 they remain asymptomatic, most chances are that they are, in fact, healthy, and can, therefore, resume activity at week 3 according to the planned routine. Conversely, if they do develop symptoms during their lock-down week, they must remain in isolation, similar to all symptomatic individuals. Hence, the weekly succession is in resonance with the natural COVID-19 disease cycle, and in practice, leads to isolation of the majority of invisible spreaders.",

This is despite the potential variability in incubation times, in which a fraction of individuals may remain asymptomatic for more than the typical 5 days. We also examine the case of imperfect implementation by including a percentage of social defectors who violate their lock-down terms and remain active at all times. We find that our strategy is generally robust against such violations. As defection levels increase, however, the steep decline of the epidemic is replaced by a more minor reduction in R 0 and, hence, an effective flattening of the curve.

We assume that, even without employing major social distancing measures, such as lock-downs or quarantines, the infected individuals (I), who exhibit symptoms, are generally isolated, and hence do not contribute to the spread.

This leads to an exponential decay in E(t) that begins upon infection, representing a memory-less process, whose probability is independent of the time since exposure. In reality, however, incubation has a typical time-scale, and therefore, the transition to I occurs preferably around that time after initial exposure. Hence, in our implementation, to model the incubation period more realistically, we assume that incubation times follow an arbitrary distribution g(t), describing the probability density for an individual to remain asymptomatic for a period t \u2208 (t, t + dt). The density g(t) captures both the average incubation time, as well as its potential variability across the population. Denoting the fraction of individuals in each state by S(t), E(t), I(t) and R(t), i.e. S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1, we can model transitions (1) -(3) as shown in Appendix A.",

This captures the evolution of the unmitigated epidemic, absent any intervention policy, aside from isolation of the sick, i.e. people in the I state. We set the parameters to match the observed epidemiological data obtained for COVID-19: for the incubation period we set g(t) \u223c N (\u00b5, \u03c3 2 ), a normal distribution with mean \u00b5 = 5 days and \u03c3 = 0.5 [5, 6] . Assuming an average 11 day recovery from the onset of symptoms [8] , we set \u03b1 = 0.09 (days \u22121 ). To evaluate the infection rate \u03b2 we collected data capturing all diagnosed cases in Israel over a period of 20 days, providing an empirical observation of I(t).

This fraction f may also capture a limited amount of essential workers who are officially exempt from the lock-down. Despite the presence of potential defectors or essential workers, it remains crucial that individuals exhibiting symptoms (I state) continue to be isolated. Indeed, while asymptomatic E state individuals may have the audacity to defect, we assume that once they become symptomatic, even they will choose to abide by the social distancing norms.

The peak infection, I Peak (5), as well as the total infection, R \u221e (4), become orders of magnitude lower compared to the unmitigated spread (grey).

Setting f = 0.3, we begin to observe a decline in the performance of our strategy, as now the viral spread continues, albeit at a lower rate. Indeed, under these conditions instead of fully eliminating the spread, the alternating lock-down scheme allows to merely flatten the curve.

Below this value, alternating lock-downs effectively push R 0 below unity, and hence eliminate the epidemic: I(t) rapidly decays, and R \u221e and I Peak both approach zero, similar to the behavior below the pandemic threshold [9, 10] . Above this defection level, our strategy no longer eliminates, but flattens the epidemic curve: I(t) continues to grow, however R \u221e and I Peak become smaller, equivalent to the effect of reducing R 0 . This transition is also observed in the behavior of T . Indeed in the elimination phase (f < 0.17) the epidemic rapidly decays within a short time, while under flattening (f > 0.17) the duration is extended, and T becomes large.

Quite strikingly, we find that even extreme levels of heterogeneity in incubation time, with \u03c3 as high as 5 or 10 (namely, two times the mean), still have little impact on the performance of our strategy. In fact, under all values of \u03c3 the peak infection remains at a level of less than 1%. The only exception is when t 0 = 50, a late response in which I(t) was already above 1%, and hence I Peak reached, at its maximum level 3% (Fig. 2i, red) . For the duration T we continue to observe a similar trend, where T is low under small \u03c3, but becomes higher as \u03c3 is increased, and the I(t) curve is flattened rather than eliminated.

Indeed, while a complete lock-down is extremely stressful for the individual, the bi-weekly routine offered here relaxes the burden, and may encourage compliance.

The only enforcement of the lock-down that will still be required is for recreational activities, beyond school and work.

The epidemic is rapidly eliminated, to the extent that the blue curve in undecipherable. To observe it we include the log-scale representation (inset), showing that our mitigation reduces I(t) by orders of magnitude. As our response time is increased (blue -red gradient, see legend in panel j), we observe higher infection levels. However, under all conditions alternating lock-downs rapidly eliminate the disease.

In each of these groups there is a fraction f of defectors D and 1 \u2212 f of cooperators C. This divides all individuals into four distinct classes: LC, LD, FC and FD, capturing the cooperators/defectors in the locked-down/free groups. We use superscript to denote an individual's class, hence, e.g., E LC (t) represents the amount of exposed individuals who are in the lock-down group and are cooperative. These individuals will not contribute to the infection, as they comply with the stay-home instructions. Conversely, E LD (t) captures the defective individuals, who choose to remains active and violate the lock-down. Together with E FC (t) and E FD (t), the exposed individuals in the F group, they will contribute to spreading the virus. This results in two sets of equations. For the lock-down group L we obtainTo set the initial conditions we consider the response time t 0 when we employ our intervention. At this time point the state of the system is given by S(t 0 ), E(t 0 ), I(t 0 ), R(t 0 ). We first partition them into two equal groups, each with a fraction f of defectors. Hence at the intervention point t 0 we haveSetting the initial condition according to Eq. (35) we solve Eqs. (18) -(34) for a period of 7 days. We then switch between the L and F groups, setting S LC (t) = S FC (t), E LC (t) = E FC (t) . . . and vice versa, proceeding to solve the equations for an additional 7 days. We continue with such weekly iterations, until we reach steady-state where I(t \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 0.",
