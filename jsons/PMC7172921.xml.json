            "text": "The therapeutic potentials of approaches aiming to interfere with the blood supply can be easily appreciated when one considers the estimate that 100 tumor cells are fed by a single endothelial cell (Folkman 1997). Thus, the number of endothelial target cells is limited, in contrast to the number of tumor cells to be killed by a tumor cell-directed approach. Proofs of concept from many studies support the hypothesis put forward more than 3 decades ago that selectively interfering with the tumor blood supply would lead to strong antitumor effects.",

            "text": "Once specific vascular targets are identified, several different effector molecules could be targeted to the tumor vasculature, including radiolabeled, or cytotoxic agents (Oh et al. 2004, Veenendaal et al. 2002) as well as antiangiogenic and immunostimulatory cytokines (Halin et al. 2002). Another notable effector molecule is tissue factor (TF), which initiates the blood coagulation cascade. In the seminal work, the cell surface domain of TF was targeted to tumor blood vessels (Huang et al. 1997). This truncated extracellular domain of TF is soluble and five orders of magnitude less potent than the membrane form because the TF\u2013factor VIIa complex requires negatively charged cell surface phospholipids to activate the downstream factors IX and X, which in turn catalyze the formation of thrombin (Ruf et al. 1991). Soluble TF targeted to tumor vasculature initiates an explosive coagulation cascade that leads to intravascular thrombosis and tumor infarction (Ran et al. 1998). Targeting TF to tumor vessels has been accomplished with antibodies and peptides against tumor vasculature markers including major histocompatibility complex class II (Burrows and Thorpe 1993).",

VCAM-1 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is generally not expressed by quiescent endothelium but is induced by inflammation. The tumor vasculature and some tumor cells generally express VCAM-1. The authors observed tumor tissue necrosis and intratumor vascular fibrin thrombosis after a single systemic administration of the infusion protein. In addition, long-term treatment produced delays in tumor growth under certain conditions. Of note, after extensive analyses, the authors could find no evidence of treatment-related vascular thrombosis and necrosis in normal tissues and no evidence of systemic activation of the coagulation cascade. This work adds further support to the notion that strategies aimed at producing vascular occlusion in tumor tissues can be effective and selective.",

Interestingly, although fibronectin- and \u03b1v-integrin-targeted tissue factor induced thrombosis in small- and medium-sized blood vessels, DNA-targeted tissue factor did so in large blood vessels. Combining all three so-called \u201ccoaguligands\u201d was the most effective treatment strategy to inhibit tumor outgrowth. Thus, it is possible that controlling vascular diversity of the endothelium during tumor progression will require such multitarget approach.",

            "text": "To identify probes that home selectively to various vascular beds of normal and tumor angiogenic vasculatures, our group and others have developed an in vivo phage display technology to isolate peptides that bind selectively to target receptors that are expressed only on certain blood vessels. Both tissue-specific (Rajotte et al. 1998, Arap et al. 2002, Kolonin et al. 2002, Kolonin et al. 2004) and angiogenesis-related (Pasqualini et al. 1997, Pasqualini et al. 2000a, Arap et al. 1998, Arap et al. 2002, Arap et al. 2004, Koivunen et al. 1999, Marchi\u00f2 et al. 2004) vascular ligand receptor pairs have been identified through this technology (Pasqualini et al. 2000b). In this method, phage libraries are directly administered to mice into the tail vein, and tissues are collected and examined for phage bound to tissue-specific endothelial cell markers. Within a short circulation time (~5 min), the phage particles are unlikely to be able to leave the circulation; thus, after perfusion, only the phage population bound to the endothelium (vascular receptors) is recovered from the tissues. In vivo panning has the advantage that the isolated phage-displayed peptides home selectively to \u201cintact\u201d targets of interest; moreover, these ligand peptides may be useful for the functional analysis of the corresponding receptors and potential identification of novel drug target candidates because some of the isolated peptides have been found to bind to endothelial receptors expressed in the vasculature of specific tissues. Although monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated clinical potentials as tumor-targeting agents, poor tumor penetration of the antibodies due to the size of molecules and liver/bone marrow toxicity by nonspecific uptake of the antibodies remain the two major limitations of antibody-based therapy (Shockley et al. 1991). Peptidic targeting agents may ease the problems associated with antibody cancer therapy. Peptides obtained from in vivo phage display technology can exert anticancer effect by inhibiting angiogenesis, decreasing tumor metastasis activity, or inhibiting enzymes important for neoplastic cell spread. They can also be used themselves as targeting molecules of receptor-targeted toxins and gene therapy, imaging and/or therapeutic agents, and nanomedical devices. Thus, our approach provides a straightforward way to identify drug-accessible tumor cell surface receptors and to discover peptide ligands that can serve as mimetic prototype drugs. Unlike genomic or proteomic-based approaches that rely on differential expression levels of transcripts or protein products, this discovery platform directly addresses functional protein\u2013protein interactions at the level of physical binding. In contrast to protein array systems, it is possible to select binding peptides even if the ligand\u2013receptor interaction is mediated by conformational (rather than linear) epitopes. In summary, ligand-directed screening of combinatorial libraries on tumor cell surfaces may lead to improved selection of functionally relevant peptides that can be developed for targeting \u201cdruggable\u201d molecular targets.",

            "text": "We have also devised a means of identifying peptides that home to the angiogenic vasculature of tumors (Table 1). Moreover, we have assembled a panel of peptide motifs that target the blood vessels of tumor xenografts (reviewed in Kolonin et al. 2001). These motifs include the sequences CDCRGDCFC (termed RGD-4C), NGR, CPRECES, and GSL. The RGD-4C peptide has previously been identified as selectively binding \u03b1v integrins and has been shown to home to the vasculature of tumor xenografts in nude mice. The tumor homing is possible because \u03b1v integrins play an important role in angiogenesis: the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins are absent or expressed at low levels in normal endothelial cells but are induced in the angiogenic vasculature of tumors (Pasqualini et al. 1997, Brooks et al. 1994a, Brooks et al. 1994b, Hammes et al. 1996, Wickham et al. 1997, Sipkins et al. 1998, Hood et al. 2002, Dickerson et al. 2004). Phage displaying a double cyclic RGD-4C peptide exhibited 10\u201320 times higher tumor-homing ability than the negative control phages (Arap et al. 1998, Pasqualini et al. 1997). To date, \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, VEGF receptors, and the EDB domain of fibronectin have been extensively studied as targets for the delivery of toxic drugs into tumor endothelial cells. We reported that RGD-4C or the cyclic CNGRC conjugated to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin or to the proapoptotic peptide (KLAKLAK)2 increases the therapeutic index and reduces toxicity in vivo (Arap et al. 1998, Ellerby et al. 1999). Moreover, the NGR peptide has been shown to improve the antitumor effects of tumor necrosis factor and interferon-\u03b3 when fused to these cytokines (Curnis et al. 2000, Curnis et al. 2005). We recently identified aminopeptidase N/CD13 as the angiogenic receptor for the NGR motif (Pasqualini et al. 2000a) and aminopeptidase A (APA) as the angiogenic receptor for the CPRECESIC motif (Marchi\u00f2 et al. 2004). Our group showed that APA is strongly up-regulated in angiogenic tumor blood vessels but barely detectable in normal blood vessels; the enzymatic activity of APA colocalizes to its expression pattern in human tumors. We showed that the CPRECESIC motif inhibits its enzymatic activity, homes to tumor vasculature in vivo, and inhibits tumor growth (Marchi\u00f2 et al. 2004). Some of the targets in tumor blood vessels turned out to be matrix metalloproteinases (Koivunen et al. 1999, Marchi\u00f2 et al. 2004). Similarly, selective peptide inhibitors of gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 localized to murine tumors and prevented tumor growth upon intravenous injection (Koivunen et al. 1999).",

Markers in the angiogenic neovasculature are either expressed at very low levels or not at all in nonproliferating endothelial cells. Interestingly, many of these tumor vascular markers are proteases (somewhat intuitive, given that malignant tumors are invasive); some of the markers also serve as viral receptors, such as \u03b1v integrins, receptors for adenoviruses (Wickham et al. 1993); CD13, a receptor for coronaviruses (Yeager et al. 1992); and MMP-2 and MMP-9, recently shown to be receptors for echoviruses (Pulli et al. 1997). It is tempting to speculate that bacteriophage (i.e., prokaryotic viruses) may use the same cellular receptors as do eukaryotic viruses. In fact, the structure of the phage capsid protein provides good evidence that bacteriophage share ancestry with animal viruses (Hendrix 1999). More than an evolutionary biology footnote, these findings do suggest that the receptors isolated by in vivo phage display will have cell internalization capability, a key feature if one wishes to use peptide motifs as therapy carriers targeted to selective cell subpopulations.",

This condition is the leading cause of death in developed countries. The development of targeted imaging agents for timely identification of unstable atherosclerotic lesions is an unmet need because the rupture of these plaques often results in myocardial infarctions and strokes (Fuster 1994). Several targeted nuclear imaging agents have been developed to report on high-risk features of atherosclerotic lesions (Mari and Strauss 2002). Molecular changes on the endothelial surface are considered important contributors to the initiation, progression, and thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis (Ross 1993a, Ross 1993b, Fuster 1994). However, the profile of the endothelial surface protein display during atherogenesis is still poorly characterized. Although adhesive cell-surface glycoproteins, such as selectin (Dong et al. 1998) and VCAM-1 (Cybulsky and Gimbrone 1991), appear to play a role in atherogenesis, systematic exploration of the affected endothelial surfaces has been hampered by technical limitations. Liu et al. (2003), have used in vivo phage display technology for identification of peptide probes that selectively bind to atherosclerotic lesions induced in apoE knockout mice. The cellular events in this model are thought to mimic, at least in part, molecular changes that occur in the hypercholesterolemic animal models and perhaps in the human disease (Boisvert et al. 1999, Curtiss and Boisvert 2000). Strikingly, GRP78 has again been identified as the endothelial surface target of one selected peptide. This peptide preferentially bound ex vivo to resected human arterial atherosclerotic lesions. The three other selected peptides homologous to TIMP-2 recapitulated the binding to lesions and were, in turn, inhibited by TIMP-2 protein.",

            "text": "Progress in gene therapy depends on the development of ligand-directed vectors that will enable the systemic targeted delivery of genes. The rational design, construction, and testing of vascular-targeted gene delivery vectors is a promising route to improve the safety and efficacy of gene therapy. It would be highly advantageous if gene delivery to vascular cells could be improved in efficiency (thus enabling reduced doses to be used and potentially reduced immunogenicity) and improved selectivity (thus reducing potential deleterious side-effects of transgene expression at nontarget sites). Vector targeting strategies have advanced substantially in the recent past, enabling construction of vectors that can home to defined sites in vivo after systemic application. Adenovirus (Ad) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) are commonly used for cardiovascular gene therapy. The most commonly used Ad vectors for gene therapy are based on serotypes 2 and 5. In cardiovascular disease, adenoviruses can transduce the endothelium and smooth muscle cells within the blood vessel wall, albeit only upon administration of high titers (Lemarchand et al. 1993, French et al. 1994). This has not hindered preclinical progression of Ad serotype 5 vectors to clinical trials for ischemia (Grines et al. 2002, Hedman et al. 2003). It would therefore be of benefit for cardiovascular gene therapy to develop adenoviruses with a more favorable profile. This can be achieved in several ways, including the use of antibodies to retarget the virus to alternative receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme or E-selectin (Harari et al. 1999, Reynolds et al. 2000), targeting peptides inserted into the HI loop of the fiber structure to modulate receptor binding (Nicklin et al. 2000, Nicklin et al. 2004), molecular adaptors (Trepel et al. 2000a, Trepel et al. 2000b), or by pseudotyping (involving the exchange of the Ad fiber for a fiber from an alternative serotype that possesses a more favorable cell binding profile (Chillon et al. 1999, Havenga et al. 2001). All these strategies have provided proof of concept for improvement in the transduction of vascular cells (Nicklin and Baker 2002).",

Unfortunately, endothelial cells are apparently poorly transduced by AAV-2 (Richter et al. 2000, Nicklin et al. 2001). Indeed, the deficiency of AAV-2 for endothelial transduction was recognized by Richter et al., (2000), who showed that local delivery of AAV-2 to blood vessels led to transduction of underlying vascular smooth muscle cells, even in the presence of intact endothelium. Subsequent studies have reported that sequestration of AAV-2 within the extracellular matrix around endothelial cells (thus preventing cell binding and entry) and degradation of internalized AAV-2 particles in the proteasome are the two factors responsible for the inefficient transduction of endothelial cells by AAV-2 (Nicklin et al. 2001, Pajusola et al. 2002).",

In the case of targeting peptides, two main methods have been assessed thus far for vascular cells. First, phage-display-derived peptides have been incorporated into AAV-2 capsids at position 587 (for optimal peptide insertion within the capsid to display the inserted peptide on the surface of the virion (Girod et al. 1999). Subsequent studies showed increased efficiency and selectivity of endothelial cell transduction in vitro and in vivo after intravenous administrations using either targeting peptides with seven or 12 residues (Nicklin et al. 2001, White et al. 2004). In an elegant alternative, Muller et al. (2003) introduced random peptide libraries displayed on the capsid of AAV-2. Screening of this AAV library on human primary coronary artery endothelial cells yielded a motif that enhanced infectivity of these endothelial cells, as compared with nonendothelial cells. It remains to be determined whether this approach will be successful in vivo (Muller et al. 2003, Lieber 2003).",

Prokaryotic viruses such as bacteriophage (phage) might offer an attractive alternative to other viral and nonviral vectors because they can, in theory, overcome the drawbacks of other animal vectors. For example, a major advantage of phage over eukaryotic viral vectors is their lack of tropism for mammalian cells (Barrow and Soothill 1997, Barbas et al. 2000). Phage can also be safely administered to patients, as evidenced by the fact that humans received bacteriophage during the preantibiotic era without adverse effects (Barrow and Soothill 1997). Therefore, they can be engineered to deliver genes to such cells without the need to eliminate native tropism, a concern for current animal viral\u2013vector targeting (Ivanenkov et al. 1999, Poul and Marks 1999, Larocca et al. 1999). Delivery of reporter genes has been achieved by genetically modified phage particles displaying peptides for surface receptors such as FGF-2, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor (Larocca et al. 1998) and ErbB-2 (Monaci et al. 2001). However, current phage-based vectors are otherwise generally considered poor gene therapy vectors. Recently, Piersanti et al. (2004), reported the construction of a lambda-phage-based vector displaying the full-length of the penton base of adenovirus. The penton base, which mediates attachment entry, endosomal escape, and proteasome resistance of adenovirus in mammalian cells, was able to confer these characteristics to the phage particles.",

Ligand-directed vascular targeting agents have proven their mode of action and antitumoral efficacy in several preclinical animal models. Currently there are more than a dozen vascular targeting agents under preclinical or clinical investigation being tested for systemic treatment of disseminated tumor disease. Endothelial cell surface receptors of the neovasculature are candidate therapeutic targets in cancer. In the last decade, the phage display library technique has been successfully used to discover cell surface binding peptides. Peptides are excellent alternative targeting agents for human cancers, and they may alleviate some of the problems associated to antibody targeting.",
