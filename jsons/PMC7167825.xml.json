Conversely, many pneumonia cases (as defined clinically and radiologically) at this age are caused by viruses.19, 20 In a Chilean study of pneumonia in the first year of life, the only significant risk factor found was wheezing during the first 3 months after birth, and the only protective factor was exclusive breast feeding for at least 4 months.21\n",

            "text": "It seems quite clear that children prone to RW are also prone to suffer from pneumonia. To what extent this is just reflecting a common infective cause for either condition; or the sharing of similar risk factors, either environmental or familial, is difficult to say. If, as some studies have shown,19, 20 many pneumonia cases are due to viral infections, the idea of a common infective cause of the two conditions acting on predisposed lungs seems reasonable; also, the reduced airway caliber in wheezy infants, hampering mucociliary clearance, may predispose to infections. Recently, a study performed in a high\u2010risk cohort of children up to the age of 3 years in Denmark have shown that wheezing during the first months of life was associated to bacterial respiratory infections.18 In that study, wheezy episodes were associated (OR 2.9; 95%CI: 1.9\u20134.3) with Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; and clinical pneumonia was associated to the same bacteria, although the association was stronger (OR 5.6; 95%CI: 2.4\u201313). Viruses (picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, or bocavirus) were also associated to wheezing episodes (aOR 2.8; 95%CI: 1.7\u20134.4) and to pneumonia (aOR 4.2; 95%CI: 2.4\u20137.4). In a birth cohort from a low\u2010income area in Santiago (Chile),21 the association between wheezing episodes and X\u2010ray pneumonia during the first year of life was highly significant (aOR 7.69; 95%CI: 1.32\u201344.9) and similar to that found in the present study for LA centers (aOR 6.8; 95%CI: 6.22\u20137.47). An additional potential explanation of the association between RW and pneumonia is diagnostic confusion between the two conditions: many physicians call a virus\u2010induced wheezing episode in an infant \u201cpneumonia\u201d or prescribe a course of antibiotics. A recent retrospective study from the Netherlands suggests that this diagnostic confusion may be, at least in part, an explanation for the identification of asthma as a risk factor for recurrent pneumonia in older children.25 To end, being born with a lower lung function for reasons, such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or low birth weight, could explain the association of both diseases in certain cases.",

If diagnostic confusion can be excluded, the latter suggests that RW is a potent and transversally acting risk for pneumonia very early in life, and suggests that preventive treatment in infants with RW may help avoid this complication.",

Interestingly, several factors were not shared by both the continents: male gender, parental asthma, and factors related to crowding were associated to higher prevalence of pneumonia in LA, but not in EU; while high (university) maternal education was a protective factor in LA but not in EU (although this may be more related to university education accessibility due to socioeconomic status than to continent). The scenario was quite similar when the analysis was restricted to those infants who had recurrent wheeze. This may indicate that certain familial and environmental factors predispose to both conditions. Alternatively, it suggests that diagnostic criteria for pneumonia differ between continents, in particular, when it relates to wheezing episodes associated with an upper respiratory tract infection with fever and respiratory distress.",

            "text": "The main limitation of the present study relates to classification bias both in the diagnosis of RW and of pneumonia. Although there is some feeling among pediatricians that the relationship between what parents and doctors call wheezing is low, due to certain studies carried out in the English language in the past,26, 27 this might not apply to other languages for several reasons. Firstly, one of those past studies actually found a very good agreement between parents (direct auscultation after training) and doctors (stethoscope auscultation) when parents heard the sound easily (94%) or did not heard it at all (99%). It was just when physicians barely heard it when disagreement was relatively high (32%), as parents tended not to hear the sound.26 This would indicate that certain non\u2010wheezing children in our study might in fact have suffered from mild wheezing in the first year without parents knowing, and thus be classified as non\u2010wheezers. If this was the case, our findings are even more robust as the differences between wheezers and non\u2010wheezers would have been lower. In other words, misclassification bias, if random (as it could be assumed in this case), would have tended to reducing differences between groups. Secondly, some of those validation studies are actually focused on what doctors and parents understand by the word \u201cwheezing\u201d, and not necessarily on the agreement on a specific question,27 such as the one in the present study, which specifies \u201cin the chest\u201d. Thirdly, infants included as cases had at least three wheezing episodes, which make agreement between parents and pediatricians quite probable after the first episode. Finally, and which has even greater importance, the results of studies performed in the English language cannot be extended to the languages used in the present study, as none of them has the term \u201cwheezing\u201d in their dictionary. Accordingly, the local term for \u201cwhistling\u201d was used, specifying \u201cin the chest\u201d to avoid sounds coming from the upper airways. The three validation studies22, 23, 24 carried out by EISL groups using the same question, either in the emergency or in the primary care settings, allow us to be quite reassured that the potential classification bias is not affecting the results significantly. Contrary to wheezing, pneumonia was classified according to the diagnosis made by doctors (independently of the prescription of a specific medication, such as antibiotics) from very different backgrounds and cultures; thus, criteria might have been different. We could not check whether the diagnosis was made after an X ray was performed in every instance, but have relied on the diagnosis made by a doctor, which probably included an X ray. On the other hand, it is unlikely that parents have been confused or have invented such a diagnosis. Moreover, a previous cohort study in Chile, conducted in a pediatric pulmonology unit, found a fairly similar association between wheeze and X\u2010ray pneumonia21; thus, misclassification of both conditions does not appear to have played a major role in the present study. Furthermore, the prevalence of pneumonia in LA in the EISL study (15.5%) is consistent with that found in the aforementioned birth cohort (13.3%). Moreover, if misclassification of pneumonia had been random among centers, which is a reasonable scenario, the shift would have been, as said, toward the null hypothesis, thus reinforcing all significant associations found. A second important limitation is derived from the cross\u2010sectional nature of the study, which precludes causal inference. Finally, although a statistical analysis using the center as a panel variable and stratification by continent was performed, variability between centers might be important enough to avoid the general results from being applied everywhere.",

Breast feeding for at least 3 months was the most consistent protective factor in both continents and in all populations, while infant eczema was the most consistent risk factor. Other risk or protective factors varied in LA and EU, the difference between continents being more pronounced in the population of non\u2010wheezing children. The association between pneumonia and RW provides some evidence for preventive interventions in infants with RW or asthma\u2010like symptoms.",
