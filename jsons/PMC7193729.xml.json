Influenza virus falls into type A, type B, and type C in light of the antigen of nucleoprotein (NP). Influenza virus type A could be further divided into subtypes according to the antigen difference of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) embedded in the lipid bilayer outer membrane. Avian influenza virus (AIV) of different types or subtypes demonstrates varying pathogenicity due to the difference in viral genome structure and sequence expressing protein polypeptide. Some mutant viruses could even surmount genus and order barriers to infect humans, such as H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, and H7N9, among which H5N1 or H7N9 infection could induce severe conditions and high mortality.",

In the course of infection, HA, could be hydrolyzed into peptide chain HA1 and HA2, with the former able to combine with host cell receptors and the latter as a critical subunit to mediate fusion of the virus and host cell membranes. Therefore, the influenza virus could integrate with host cell receptors mediated by HA1 and fuse with cell membrane mediated by HA2 to promote release of ribonucleoprotein (RNP).",

Alveolar space is seen with fibrinous exudation, bleeding, formation, and mechanization of hyaloid membrane. Interstitium is detected with vascular congestion, reactive fibroblast proliferation, and light lymphocyte infiltration. Part lung tissues are found with fungal infections.

Part alveolar epithelium is revealed with necrosis and exfoliation as well as reactive proliferation (Figs. 3.1 and 3.2) but without viral inclusion body in epithelial cells. Alveolar spaces are observed with effusion of plasma fluid, fibrin, red cells, and neutrophilic granulocytes, formation of hyaloid membrane, organization of squamous epithelia, and mechanization of exudates (Fig. 3.3). Part alveoli are detected with collapse or compensatory emphysema. Pulmonary interstitium is seen with fibrosis and occasional presence of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and reactive hemophagocytes. Pulmonary interstitial capillaries are viewed with transparent emboli and DIC as well as occasionally obliteration (Fig. 3.4). Pulmonary bleeding and secondary infection could also be seen.\n\n\n\n",

The majority foci of patients with human avian influenza virus pneumonia free of secondary infections are completely absorbed within 30 days, while the lungs of part of the patients may present with fibrosis or proliferation of lung interstitium. For a few severe patients, the foci absorption is relatively slow, and absorption of lung shadows still takes a relatively long time, even years, resulting in interstitial fibrosis. Imaging presentations in the phase of recovery: (1) The large patchy pulmonary consolidation shadows are gradually absorbed and become smaller and light in color, and the consolidation pulmonary tissues gradually swell. Imaging presentations are characterized by plaque-shaped and striped consolidation shadows. (2) Ground-glass-density shadows shrink gradually or are completely absorbed. (3) Pulmonary interstitium presents with fibrosis typical of lobular septum thickening, subpleural curvature shadows, paraseptal emphysema, paramediastinal pulmonary bulla, and bronchiolar dilation (Figs. 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11). (4) The pleura shows limited thickening and adhesion. (5) Pulmonary air sacs are observable during absorption of lesions, which might be induced by pulmonary parenchymal necrosis and formation of valves and could be absorbed after treatment (Figs. 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12).\n\n",

In the advanced phase, the femur head becomes fragmented and deformed, and the absorption of sclerotin between fragmented bones presents irregular low-density area, with the stellate sign absent. Based on MRI presentations, aseptic necrosis of the femur head may be divided into the following four phases: Phase I shows homogenous or inhomogeneous low-signal areas adjacent to joints above the femur head on weighted T1 and T2 imaging; phase II manifests wedge-shaped mixed low-signal band; phase III is typical of sequestrum crescent sign and cortical collapse; phase IV manifests phase III signs accompanied by joint degeneration and joint space stenosis.",
