The method is tested on an analysis of the association between heart disease incidence and a pool of socio-economic variables in Calgary over two consecutive census surveys. The method provides a reliable model, which can guide locational decisions to mitigate present and future disease incidence. The model is underpinned by a quantitative definition of neighbourhood connectivity throughout the city. Such connectivity, usually described by Euclidean distance, can be more effectively described by a specifically calibrated distance metric. The analytical results are meaningful, robust to neighbourhood size, and relatively constant over time. Owing to its effectiveness and simplicity, the procedure is generalizable to other health and socioeconomic analysis. An automatic implementation is suggested, to assist in the definition of reliable spatial regression models.",

Many of the most urgent health concerns of today's society are fundamentally spatial in nature: effective accessibility to health care services; prompt and efficient response to epidemic outbreaks; detection and monitoring of environmental health hazards; and consequent urban planning. Spatial analytical methods can be useful management and policy tools to address these concerns, but their use rests on assumptions that are often violated by empirical processes, with the result that much current applied research fails to bring this toolset to its full potential. Presently, management decisions are often supported by quantitative models, specifically regression models; these are potentially desirable tools that can link, for example, disease incidence to residents' age, thus providing a realistic picture of where health care services will be most needed in the near future. Unfortunately, current models are often uncertain or unreliable. In the best cases, unreliable models provide decision makers with a realistic, but blurry picture of the factors they need to manage, potentially leading to ineffective decisions; in the worst cases the picture is so blurry that it may lead to management decisions that are not just ineffective, but harmful. The uncertainty stems from two properties of geographical phenomena: spatial non-stationarity (things tend to vary unevenly in space), and spatial dependence (near things tend to be more similar than distant things) [1] . Addressing the limitations of regression models is key to improving the reliability of much current quantitative analysis, if, as noted by Griffith and Amrhein [2] , most of the multivariate techniques commonly used by geographers can be formulated or reformulated in terms of regression analysis.",

In turn, the spatial weight matrix is specified by a small number of parameters: an appropriate measurement of distance, a correct definition of the range of the observed spatial dependence, and a correct definition of the distance decay effect within the defined neighbourhood [3] .

The spatial regression model analyzes the association of demographic and socio-economic factors with the incidence of heart disease in Calgary, a large Canadian city. Population distribution within the city, clustering of age groups, and socioeconomic pattern are the main factors considered; urban connectivity enters the model through the measurement of distance among spatial units. By optimizing the distance measurement and specifying an appropriate spatial weight metric, this study provides a method for enhancing the reliability of the estimated model parameters. As a consequence, the model represents an effective analytical support tool for policy and planning decisions. The same spatial regression analysis is estimated for two temporal intervals, hinging on two consecutive census surveys (2001 and 2006) . The comparison of the analytical results constitutes a preliminary but important exploration of spatio-temporal dynamics within the city, its health and demographic characteristics, and its socio-economic structure. The analytical findings provide the foundation for more advanced computational developments.",

In addition to the individual characteristics that correlate with the disease, there are a number of factors that are related to a complex variable usually referred to as \"lifestyle\". Individual characteristics, such as genetic background or simultaneous presence of other conditions, are known as non-modifiable risk factors, in contrast with modifiable risk factors, which include such factors as physical activity, smoking, and diet. These modifiable risk factors tend to correlate with demographic and socio-economic characteristics of individuals [4] . At most geographical scales, demographic and socio-economic characteristics tend to display a pattern, or spatial clustering; disease prevalence, likewise, presents a characteristic geographical distribution, or spatial pattern. For this reason a spatial regression model is an appropriate tool to analyze the spatial pattern of disease occurrence as a function of localized demographic and socio-economic characteristics. This is also the reason why this type of phenomena tends to manifest spatial dependence and non-stationarity. Spatial autoregressive modelling is therefore an effective analytical tool, capable of providing estimates of the coefficients linking disease prevalence to each demographic and socioeconomic factor. The reliable parameters obtained with this method can later be used for analysis and prediction, to ultimately design proactive policy solutions aimed at alleviating and mitigating disease prevalence over the study region.",

The medical records represent disease prevalence, and the census variables represent demographic and socio-economic factors. Cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure for patients experiencing cardiovascular symptoms, which provides important prognostic information for individuals affected by cardiovascular conditions [5] . For the present analysis, a subset of patient records were selected from the provincial database, obtaining a sample of patients undergoing the procedure in Calgary from 1998 to 2002 1 , and from 2003 to 2007 2 . Patient address is released at the postal code level; postal code conversion files (PCCFs) from Census Canada were used to calculate the geographic coordinates in latitude and longitude, which were subsequently converted to easting and northing coordinates prior to performing distance computations.",

These variables are available at the dissemination area 3 and census tract levels: for this analysis, the census tract aggregation level was used. At this spatial resolution the spatial dependence is more severe; hence there is a stronger need to implement efficient spatial regression models. In addition, these relatively large units are more meaningful in terms or urban planning and health policies; therefore, a model calibrated at this scale is more useful and applicable than one calibrated at the dissemination area level. The cardiac data were spatially aggregated to match the census tracts, resulting in 182 valid census tract records for the period around the 2001 census, and 186 records for the period around the 2006 census. Fig. 1 shows the Calgary census tracts and the distribution of catheterization cases over the two study periods: Fig. 1a for the 2001 census and Fig. 1b for the 2006 census. It may be worth noting that during the study period, the procedure was available only at the Foothills Hospital, located in the northwest sector of Calgary. Calgary's urban structure is a combination of numerous development episteme. Local patterns of connectivity vary according to local design. For instance, grid pattern road development of the inner city offers different travel options than the circular, cul-de-sac design of its outlying suburban counterparts. Furthermore, large variations in both physical size and shape of neighbourhood form are very apparent in the city. Thus, there is a need to capture how varying urban patterns affect neighbourhood connectivity.",

On the normalized variables, descriptive spatial and statistical analyses were conducted, to test their normality and other statistical properties. Cross-correlation analysis (Pearson's coefficient) was used to test the strength of the correlation between each explanatory variable and the dependent variable, as well as the cross-correlation among explanatory variables.

The values of Moran's I can vary between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates perfect negative spatial autocorrelation, 0 indicates absence of spatial autocorrelation, and + 1 indicates perfect positive spatial autocorrelation. The computation of this index requires the specification of a model of spatial dependence, defined by a spatial weight matrix. The matrix defined for the calculation of the spatial autocorrelation index will also be used for the estimation of the spatial autoregressive models (Section 3.2). In its simplest form, the matrix is a binary structure, but it is common to use more complex specifications, which include various types of weights to describe distance decay effects. There are several ways of specifying spatial contiguity [7, 8] : a common method is the definition of k orders of spatial neighbours; an alternative method is a threshold distance; a third method is based on shared borders (for areal units only). While some methods are heavily dependent on the topology of the spatial units, the computation of spatial neighbours is a very general method. In all cases, the extent of the spatial dependence must be defined, either via a maximum distance parameter, or via a number (k) of nearest neighbours.",

Perhaps the most critical of these properties is spatial dependence, which results in a redundancy of information that inflates the variance (uncertainty) associated with the parameter estimates.

Unlike distances measured empirically along a given road network, the use of a specific distance metric provides a consistent model of distance throughout a city or a region, which provides the benefits of generalization but filters out local detail. These distance measurements have been usefully applied in practice for the effective provision and accessibility of health care services [22] . Preliminary analysis has suggested a value of p=1.54 as the best Minkowski value to represent travel along the Calgary road network [23] . Our purpose is not to mimic the city road network but to select a distance metric that best represents neighbourhood connectivity, which in turn is defined by the interplay of road network and urban design. 4) is used in this application to experiment with a systematic sample of p values (i.e., p = 1.1, p = 1.2, etc.) in the interval [1 \u2264 p \u2264 2], to evaluate the performance of alternative spatial neighbourhood definitions based on the various p values for a given order of neighbourhood and distance decay functions. The criterion for choosing an optimal p value is the minimization of the variance of the estimates of the spatial regression (SAR) model (Section 3.1). The correlation is modeled in the spatial weight matrix not only by a distance metric but also by a distance decay function and a distance range, defined by the number of nearest neighbours. Even though these three parameters are not mutually independent, the method discussed in this paper focuses on the distance metric. Through a series of empirical experiments, the best value of the other parameters was also identified (number of nearest neighbours and distance decay function, respectively). Given these parameters, we determine the distance metric that minimizes the variance of the model estimates. This process leads to the specification of a set of alternative spatial regression models, based on an array of spatial weight matrices and distance metrics. For each survey period, an iterative process guides us to the selection of the metric that, all else being equal, leads to the lowest model variance. It is our intention to extend this line of work to encompass the definition of an algorithm for the selection of the optimal metric.",

Those analyses indeed suggest that the spatial autocorrelation observed in the disease pattern may be driven by the spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of senior citizens. The pattern of crosscorrelation observed for the 2006 period (Section 4.3) suggests, instead, a lower correlation between disease and senior citizens, accompanied by higher correlations between disease and younger age groups. These observations can explain the lower spatial autocorrelation observed in the disease pattern: younger age groups tend to be less clustered in Calgary, therefore less spatially autocorrelated. As a consequence also the disease pattern displays a lower spatial autocorrelation for the 2006 survey period.",

The economic boom experienced by the city during the 2003-2007 period caused a massive population increase, mainly constituted by young individuals, which in turn caused an increase in the number of residents, particularly in the suburbs [26] . The spatial autocorrelation index is a joint measure of distance and correlation: these results indicate that it is correlation that drives the change in the spatial autocorrelation index, and therefore the p value of the distance metric evolves, to best capture the new correlation pattern.

The positive relationship between disease incidence and low education (grade 13 or less) suggests a relationship with old age and fringes of poverty and low social status. The negative coefficient linking disease incidence and areas dominated by post-secondary, non-university education identifies trade workers and professionals: a category with fairly high income levels. Overall, the education variables suggest that higher education levels are associated with greater income and lower disease incidence, suggesting that higher education levels may lead to healthier lifestyle and lower risk of disease.

All the indicators have been scaled and plotted in one single graph so that they can be compared more easily.

Conversely, the use of alternative distance metrics has only a negligible impact on the goodness-of-fit indicators. The indices that are most affected are the autoregressive coefficient, rho, and the spatial autocorrelation index on the model residuals, Moran's I.

The rho value displays a distinct peak at p=1.6, suggesting that with that metric the autoregressive coefficient is most effective at capturing the spatial dependence in the model's residuals. For the same p value, a corresponding trough is displayed by residual standard error and sigma square. Visually, the latter features appear to be much less pronounced than the rho value, but range and scaling of these indices should be considered. Somewhat in contrast with the above values, the spatial autocorrelation index in the model's residuals (Moran's I) displays an overall decreasing trend, reaching its lowest value at p = 1.9. The interpretation of this trend presents some difficulties, in that all its values are negative, indicating that negative spatial autocorrelation increases for increasing p values. Moreover, the values of residual Moran's I over the [1 \u2264 p \u2264 2] interval are not only insignificant, but very low, as its maximum value is -0.001 for p = 1 and its minimum value is -0.030 for p = 1.9. For all these reasons, the trend of the rho coefficient and of the variance indicators will be weighed more heavily than residual Moran's I in the identification of a suitable p value. A p value of 1.6 is therefore the most suitable value emerging from this analysis.",

The variable most highly correlated with disease in 2006 is no longer \"age 65 plus\", but \"single\". Most likely this is due to the recent phenomenon of internal immigration (from less wealthy parts of the country) of young persons seeking work in the booming Alberta economy (see also Section 4.2).

The model consists of only two variables, i.e., \"single\" (negative coefficient) and \"grade 13 and less\" (positive coefficient) suggesting that the disease incidence is inversely correlated with family status and directly correlated with lower education. Compared with the 2001 model, this is a simpler, but less informative model. The presence of the variable \"grade 13 and less\" confirms the importance of education attainment in explaining the disease incidence. The variable \"single\" may indicate a social evolution, in that the negative correlation between disease and of families with children has been replaced by a negative correlation between disease and singles. These results are likely related to the demographic and social transformations induced by the recent economic boom experienced by the city of Calgary.",

Following this method, it is possible to maintain a uniform framework, and simply modify the p value to reflect variations in the correlation pattern or the physical network connectivity, as shown by the shift in the best p value from p=1.6 to p=1.8 over the interval between the 2001 and the 2006 census surveys (Section 4.2).",

This series of spatial weight matrices is initially used to compute the spatial autocorrelation index for the variable of interest. This analysis identifies a potential best p value that maximizes the value of the spatial autocorrelation index for that variable. The consequent estimation of a series of spatial regression models has consistently confirmed that the p value preliminarily identified by the spatial autocorrelation analysis is also the best p value for the multivariate spatial regression models, as indicated most strongly by the variation of the spatial autoregressive coefficient (rho). This is a vital point, which suggests that one can simply identify an optimal p value from the spatial autocorrelation analysis, and then proceed to the definition and selection of the spatial regression model using the spatial weight matrix based on that p value.",

Conversely, the impact of such variation is constantly negligible on the indicators of goodness-of-fit. These results corroborate the indication that the spatial regression model can be specified and selected independently of the spatial weight matrix specification, thereby suggesting a simplified procedure that can pursue the two main processes, (1) spatial weight matrix definition and (2) model specification and selection, independently.",
