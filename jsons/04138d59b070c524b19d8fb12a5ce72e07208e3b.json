We hypothesize that measurement of cTnI values at the time of hospital admission and following up the values longitudinally may help us identify the subset of patients with COVID 19, who may progress towards severe complications and death. This might help in focussing more on this subset of patients which in turn might help in lowering the morbidity and mortality associated with the current pandemic worldwide. Further studies on this topic is urgently required which will help in further investigations into this topic and help in controlling the current outbreak and deaths associated with it worldwide.",
