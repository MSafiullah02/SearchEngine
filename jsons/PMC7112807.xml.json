The nonspecific binding of DNA molecules to the paper's fibers as well as paper self-fluorescence, negatively influence the noise level and thus the LOD.

            "text": "Therefore, LAMP has its merits, as the heating system is simpler, and there is no temperature cycling and cooling as required for PCR. Also, the sample pretreatment module is easier to incorporate due to a more robust LAMP process compared to PCR. The results analysis of LAMP is also much easier, as the resulting fluorescence after amplification can be observed by the naked eye. A lower LOD can be better achieved by LAMP in food-borne pathogen detection than PCR [26]. Moreover, the simple structure of LAMP chips provides opportunities for mass production and industrialization. As a result, LAMP-based integrated systems [92] are more suitable for application in POC diagnostics [93] than PCRs. LAMP-based diagnostics are not likely to replace conventional techniques such as PCR; they will coexist in parallel, as each one has its strengths and weaknesses.",

The utilization of LAMP was demonstrated for the diagnosis of viruses, bacteria, and allergens in food. Nevertheless, there is still much room for improvement in detection methods for the integration of LAMP in POC applications. Ideally, the detection modules have to be miniaturized and integrated with the on-chip LAMP system. Thus, developing a mobile biosensor with a LAMP technology application may result in significant advancement towards the detection of pathogens directly from clinical samples, which is especially important in cash-strapped countries or when working with highly contagious clinical samples. Due to its high specificity, LAMP can also be used for the early detection of genetic disorders, an important aspect of prevention diseases associated with them and their treatment. In summary, LAMP could be the ideal method for diagnostics in an everyday POC setting.",
