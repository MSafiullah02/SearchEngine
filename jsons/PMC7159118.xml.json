It has been shown that RSV infections in infancy are associated with a TH2\u2010like cytokine response (see https://doi.org/10.5694/j.1326-5377.2002.tb04823.x\n\n3\n) in the upper airway, whether or not the infant is atopic.\n4\n TH2 cytokine patterns are known to be associated with viral immunopathology and allergic\u2010type responses, in contrast to TH1 cytokine patterns, which are classically associated with viral elimination. It has also been shown that levels of at least one cytokine (IL\u20102) are similar in upper and lower respiratory tract secretions during RSV infection, suggesting that upper respiratory tract levels can be used as an indicator of lower respiratory tract levels.\n5\n Interestingly, the nasal cytokine responses to rhinoviruses are of the TH1 type,\n4\n as are the responses to other viruses (except RSV). This could explain the propensity for RSV to cause wheezing, but not the association between other respiratory viruses and wheezing.",
