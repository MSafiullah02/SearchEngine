Malnutrition and traditional infectious diseases have been replaced by chronic non-communicable diseases and emerging infectious diseases. In China, more than 80% of deaths are caused by chronic non-communicable diseases. These increasing worldwide needs have placed biomedicine centre stage. The development of biomedical research in China, a country with 1\u00b73 billion people, is a massive and unique challenge.1 Initially when China opened its doors via policy reform, economic issues were the major concern and Deng Xiaoping advocated the notion of \u201cscience and technology constituting a primary productive force\u201d.2 In the mid-1980s, when the national high-technology programme (863) was launched,3 biotechnology was the main priority.",
