To avoid the loss of isoflurane by diffusion, we took excised turbinates immediately to the laboratory where they were brushed and the ciliated epithelium was examined.

For the first time we have shown that the decrease in ciliary beat frequency following isoflurane is not accompanied by significant ciliary dyskinesia. It is possible that anaesthetic agents, such as isoflurane, may play a part in nasal symptoms following general anaesthesia by depressing ciliary function. Whether direct exposure of the nasal epithelium or lower respiratory tract to higher concentrations of isoflurane would result in a greater degree of ciliary slowing, or whether this would then have an effect on ciliary beat pattern, requires further investigation.",
