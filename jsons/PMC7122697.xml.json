            "text": "\nTurkey coronaviral enteritis caused by turkey coronavirus (TCoV) has been reported with varied severity in clinical signs in the affected turkey flocks from different states in the USA [1, 2], Canada [3], Brazil [4], and Europe [5]. The major clinical signs of TCoV infection include depression, ruffled feathers, watery diarrhea, decreased body weight gain, and uneven flock growth. The most striking gross lesions are markedly distended intestine with gaseous and watery content, especially in the ileum and ceca. The salient histopathologic findings include shortening of the intestinal villi, increase in crypt depth, and widening of intervillous spaces [1]. TCoV belongs to species coronavirus of the genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. The genome of TCoV is a linear positive-sense single-stranded RNA encoding three major structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein. While M and N genes are conserved, S gene is a more common target used for coronavirus (CoV) differentiation because S gene is highly variable among different CoVs. The S gene sequences among different TCoV isolates (93\u201399.7 %) are relatively conserved as compared to different infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains, although both TCoV and IBV belong to the same species Avian coronavirus [6\u20138]. Because the pair-wise comparison of S gene sequences revealed only 34 % of similarity between TCoV isolates and IBV strains while the remaining 3\u2032-end encoding region shared over 80 % of similarity, it has been suggested that TCoV arose through a recombination of S gene from IBV [6, 9\u201311].",

In step 1, intestine tissues are collected from TCoV-infected turkeys and TCoV is purified through ultracentrifugation on continuous sucrose gradient. In step 2, TCoV RNA is extracted from intestines and reverse transcribed to cDNA. In step 3, the full-length S gene of TCoV is amplified and sequenced. In step 4, the nucleotide sequence of the full-length S gene of TCoV is assembled from 12 sequence fragments flanking the entire length of S gene. The S gene sequences of TCoV isolates and those from other coronaviruses published in GenBank are further analyzed by alignment and phylogenetic tree and thus TCoV genotypes are determined.",

Sequence alignment can arrange the sequences of DNA and deduced amino acids to identify regions of similarity resulting from evolutionary relationships among the compared sequences.Open MEGA6 program, click \u201cAlign\u201d on the tool bar, choose \u201cEdit/Build Alignment,\u201d check the option of \u201ccreate a new alignment\u201d in the first dialog box, push \u201cOK,\u201d and then choose either \u201c DNA\u201d or \u201cProtein\u201d sequence alignment, and the Alignment Explorer window will open.There are three ways to add sequences into alignment program. For the first two ways, go to \u201cEdit\u201d menu and click either \u201cInsert Blank Sequence\u201d to key in each sequence manually or \u201cInsert Sequence From File\u201d to import the selected sequences in Text (*.txt, *.seq) or FASTA file formats. For the third way, go to \u201cWeb\u201d menu and click \u201cQuery GenBank\u201d to import Web-based sequences by checking the \u201cAdd to Alignment\u201d option for each interested sequence.After all sequences for alignment are added, go to \u201cEdit\u201d menu in the Alignment Explorer window to select all sequences for alignment, and then go to \u201cAlignment\u201d menu to select \u201cAlign by Clustal W (Codons)\u201d for the process of alignment. Choose Align Codons for DNA alignment to avoid introducing gaps into positions that would result in frame shifts in the real sequences. Use the default settings of Clustal W method for DNA alignment but change the Multiple Alignment Gap Opening penalty to 3 and the Multiple Alignment Gap Extension penalty to 1.8 for protein alignment. When the alignment is complete, go to \u201cData\u201d menu and choose \u201cSave Session\u201d to save the alignment result as Aln session (*.mas) format. For further construct of phylogenetic tree, go to \u201cData\u201d: menu and click \u201cExport Alignment\u201d to choose \u201cMEGA Format\u201d to save the alignment result as .meg extension.A phylogenetic tree can be constructed by many methods used widely and maximum likelihood (ML) method is chosen based on previous coronaviral studies.ML uses a variety of substitution models to correct for multiple changes at the same site during the evolutionary history of the sequences, like Tamura 3-parameter and Kimura 2-parameter models, and the best model to use for each analysis can be calculated by MEGA6 program. Go to MEGA6 main window and choose \u201cModels\u201d to select \u201cFind Best DNA/Protein Models (ML).\u201d Choose the alignment file saved before for calculation. Note the preferred model to construct a phylogenetic tree based on the list of models in order of preferences.Go to MEGA6 main window and choose \u201cPhylogeny\u201d to select \u201cConstruct/Test Maximum Likelihood Tree.\u201d Fill in the parameters of \u201cModel/Method\u201d and \u201cRates among Sites\u201d based on the preferred parameters calculated previously in the preference dialog appearing. Select \u201cPartial Deletion\u201d in \u201cGap/Missing Data Treatment\u201d to avoid losing too much information. Set \u201cNo. of Bootstrap Replicates\u201d to 1000 under \u201cPhylogeny Test\u201d to estimate the reliability of the tree.After computing, a tree explorer window will open the tree. Save the tree as a (*.mts) file, choose \u201cExport Current Tree (Newick)\u201d from \u201cFile\u201d menu for further modification in other tree drawing program, choose \u201cSave as PDF File\u201d from \u201cImage\u201d menu for graphic file format accepted for publishing, or choose \u201cSave as PNG File\u201d or \u201cSave as Enhanced Meta File\u201d for further process.\n\n\n",

If the volume of intestines reaches 5 mL mark of 50 mL tube, add 25 mL (5 volumes) of chill sterile PBS for homogenization. It is recommended to homogenize the intestine tissue for 30 s and cool the tube in ice in cycles until the intestine tissue is homogenized thoroughly because the heat produced by the process of homogenization can damage the integrity of RNA in intestine tissues.To prepare 40\u201360 % sucrose continuous gradient, Bio-Rad Model 395 Gradient former or equivalent gradient maker is used. Put 5 mL of 40 % sucrose and 5 mL of 60 % sucrose in two connected compartments of Gradient former, respectively. Place a stirrer bar in the compartment with 40 % sucrose (lower extreme concentration of sucrose gradient). There is a valve to control the connection between two compartments and a plastic tube leading to an ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter) from the compartment with 40 % sucrose. Put the Gradient former on top of magnetic stirrer. Open the stirrer and wait till the stirrer bar stir steady and then open the valve. Collect the mixed sucrose in an ultracentrifuge tube to get 10 mL of 40\u201360 % sucrose continuous gradient.To increase the successful rate of TA cloning, a 3\u2032 A-overhangs post-amplification is performed. Add Taq polymerase buffer, dATP (10 mM), and 0.5 U of Taq polymerase to the purified PCR product. Incubate the reaction for 10\u201315 min at 72 \u00b0C. For further TA cloning, mix 1 \u03bcL of pCRII-TOPO vector, 1 \u03bcL of Salt Solution provided by the kit, and 4 \u03bcL of the purified PCR product gently and incubate the reaction at room temperature for 30 min. For further transformation, add 2 \u03bcL of TA cloning reaction to 50 \u03bcL of Top10F\u2032 E. coli and incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat-shock the cells for 30 s at 42 \u00b0C without shaking and transfer the cells to ice immediately. Add 250 \u03bcL of room temperature S.O.C. medium provided by the kit. Cap the tube tightly and shake the tube horizontally (200 rpm) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Spread 10\u201350 \u03bcL from the transformation on a pre-warmed selective plate and incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C. To ensure even spreading of small volumes, add 20 \u03bcL of super optimal broth with catabolite repression (S.O.C.) medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Pick about ten white or light blue colonies for analysis. Do not pick dark blue colonies.\n",
