Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASC) and Office Based Anesthesia Practices are unique healthcare environments that necessitate specific emergency planning for disasters and other emergencies. There is currently wide variability in emergency preparedness amongst Ambulatory Surgery Centers and Office Based Anesthesia Practices (OBAs). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently estimated that of 5,485 ASCs in the United States, 1,414 were accredited by some regulatory agency while 4,071 ASCs were non-accredited [4] . There is no standard for emergency preparedness in non-accredited practices. Even those ASCs with accreditation may have different levels of emergency preparedness as accreditation organizations can have different standards or no standards at all for emergency preparedness. It is important that healthcare providers at all ambulatory surgery centers and office based anesthesia practices are aware of existing regulations for emergency preparedness and work to ensure patients and staff as well as physical resources are protected during natural disasters and other emergencies.",

Natural disasters can include earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, or tsunamis. Natural disasters generally affect a large number of people and can require coordination of both local and national resources to respond to healthcare needs [1] . The earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan in 2011 as well as Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding in Louisiana in 2005 are examples of the widespread destruction that can be caused by natural disasters. In both of these cases, healthcare systems were disrupted and largescale resources were needed to respond to the subsequent healthcare emergencies [7, 8] .",

            "text": "The dialysis community provides perspective on the importance of emergency preparedness. In response to an earthquake in Armenia in 1998 that disrupted dialysis services in the country, the International Society of Nephrology formed the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force. This task force provides expertise or resources to communities dealing with natural disasters. In response to an earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the organization provided 25 volunteers over a 2 month period to treat patients with both acute and chronic kidney injury [3] . Despite major organizational difficulties in Haiti, the task force organized renal care for patients in Haiti and arranged transfer of patients to the neighboring Dominican Republic when needed. The experience in Haiti highlights the efforts of an outside organization to organize dialysis care when the existing resources are not sufficient to adequately respond to a natural disaster. A major earthquake also struck the country of Chile in 2010 near the country's second largest city of Concepci\u00f3n. The earthquake disrupted dialysis care for 2500 people [3] . In Chile, local nephrologists were able to coordinate patient care including transfer of patients and adjustment in dialysis schedules. As a result, 100% of the affected patients had access to dialysis six days after the earthquake despite less than 60% of dialysis centers being operational [3] . In this case the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force served in an advisory role to the local nephrologists organizing care [3] . While it is difficult to compare earthquakes or other natural disasters, it is clear that having an emergency plan and resources in place prior to an emergency aids in patient care during an emergency.",

Infectious disease emergencies can be local or global in nature. Recent well publicized outbreaks of the Avian influenza, SARS and the Ebola virus are examples of infectious disease emergencies with global implications. However, a local outbreak of influenza could also require a response from an ambulatory surgery center. Acts of terrorism including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive attacks are a separate class of emergency. Active shooter events in the United States have prompted a greater awareness of these events and the need to create an emergency plan for such events. Local events that could disrupt ambulatory surgery centers or office based anesthesia practices include severe weather or the loss of utilities or other services at the practice site. In addition to all these emergencies, surgery specific emergencies like local anesthetic systemic toxicity events or onset of malignant hyperthermia are patient emergencies requiring rapid responses. Due to the large and varied types of emergencies that can affect an ambulatory surgery center or office based anesthesia practice, it is important to assess a facility's need and ability to respond to various emergencies.",

It should also consider the patient and staff population typically present at the facility including consideration for children, the elderly, or patients with disabilities [4] . Once all possible emergencies are identified they are evaluated for the likelihood that they would occur. To use recent natural disasters as an example, it would be appropriate for an ambulatory surgery center in coastal Louisiana to prioritize planning for a hurricane or flooding whereas a facility in Los Angeles might more appropriately plan for an earthquake. In addition to natural disasters, emergencies that every ambulatory surgery center or office based anesthesia practice should assess are severe weather, active shooter in the facility or nearby area, loss of utilities at the practice, and medical emergencies like malignant hyperthermia, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, or an unresponsive patient.",

This could include having assigned roles for staff in a LAST event such as bringing emergency airway equipment to the patient bedside, bringing lipid emulsion therapy to the bedside, or assisting with airway management. The plan could also ensure availability of lipid emulsion therapy and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine's Checklist for the Treatment of Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity for any such event [13] . The plan could include annual LAST drills with staff so resources and roles are well established prior to such an event.

CMS requires that a facility's emergency plan include a list of services it is able to provide during an emergency [4] . Obviously, most ambulatory surgery centers and office based anesthesia practices that provide elective surgical care would not continue to provide elective care during a true emergency.

In any emergency situation, effective communication is key to saving lives. One effective communication method is the SBAR mnemonic: Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (Figure 19.1) . It was first developed by the military then adapted to the aviation industry to combat communication barriers inherent in the work environment, which were causing life threatening crashes. In 2002, it was introduced into the healthcare system by Kaiser Permanente after the realization that there are fundamental similarities between healthcare and aviation/ military environments--both are high stress, high risk, time sensitive environments, where wrong decisions can be life threatening. It was initially introduced into rapid response teams with the goal of improving patient safety by having a standardized process for early intervention before a patient's condition deteriorates. The goal of SBAR is to overcome communication barriers by providing a standard concise framework for conveying pertinent information between members of the healthcare team, which is essential for fostering a culture of patient safety [15] .",

This is where simulation based drills could play a very important role. Simulation based training can increase emergency preparedness by exposing healthcare staff to real world emergency situations. Benefits of team based simulation include assessment of the current internal emergency disaster plans and the team's readiness to deal with the situation at hand, development and application of clinical and critical thinking skills, promotion of team based collaboration and communication skills, discovery of flawed processes, and problem solving through corrective action plans [17] .",

Prioritization can also identify significant deficiencies that should be reported to management and corrected as quickly as possible. Criteria or categories for corrective action may include the following: 1) hazards to health and safety, 2) regulatory compliance, 3) hazards to property, operations, the environment or the entity 4) conformity to national standards. Action on deficiencies should be assigned to the person or department best able to address the issue. A due date should be assigned and the corrective action database reviewed regularly to track progress.

Such practices typically do not have rapid response or code teams on site and often have leaner staffing than other parts of a health system. CMS has developed a series of guidelines to establish consistent emergency preparedness requirements for healthcare providers specifically in the ambulatory surgery setting. Components of emergency preparedness consist of planning, organizing, communicating, equipping, training, and exercising (Figure 19 .2). While the development of an emergency plan is an important first step in the process of emergency preparedness, it is also important to continuously reevaluate the emergency plan through drills, simulation, and corrective action plans.
