Often, global health has been and still is being taught and practised precisely in this way, too often without critical reflection about expertise, accountability and inefficiency, as pointed out by the authors. From our experience of teaching global health, two themes both confirm and challenge the notion of global health as public health somewhere else: the experience and demands of global health students, and the existence of global health problems in our local setting. In this commentary, drawing on examples from global health education, we call for an urgent revision of current teaching practices. In order to do so, we propose a reframing of the global health definition with a move away from a focus on geographical boundaries and instead focus on the global scope of the discipline.",

            "text": "Global health curricula often focus on health issues not only 'somewhere else', but specifically in low-income countries. In our global health teaching, we often encounter students from low-income countries who are disappointed to learn about their countries of origin-of which they may be the true experts. While originating from somewhere does not automatically make you an expert, there are examples where students have even been offended because of the simplistic way in which their countries have been described by lecturers. Moreover, students who want to do a global health master thesis on a health issue in Sweden have been discouraged to do so and are instead asked to focus on a lowincome country. We feel that it is paramount that global health education is relevant to all students, not only those from high-income countries. In particular, we applaud the student-led 'Decolonize Global Health' movement, which is challenging not only such simplistic notions of global health, but also the 'depoliticized and ahistorical' manner in which global health is taught. 2 Pressing health issues exist in all countries, and in the best of worlds, global health education can provide both tools and curiosity to explore these issues in any setting, including high-income settings. Meanwhile, global health courses particularly in undergraduate medical education including medical schools frequently include field visits to lowincome countries. These courses are very popular, but not entirely unproblematic. On the one hand, experiencing a context different from one's own can be a transformative experience, hard to come by without travelling, but on the other hand they may reinforce the idea that global health is about health somewhere else, decreasing interest in health issues at home while carrying a huge carbon footprint and perpetuating colonial or neocolonial practices. The latter is particularly true when such experiential learning is BMJ Global Health not sufficiently narrated by teachers. 3 4 In a similar vein, we have observed that medical students often appear to lack interest in traditional public health and social medicine courses within the medical curriculum, but 'global health', which covers much the same subjects, is seen as interesting, perhaps due to the perception that it is somehow exotic and involves international travel.",

Moreover, because global health has its history in tropical medicine, many global health teaching programmes are located in schools or faculties of medicine, rendering it challenging to shift towards a curriculum highlighting the social sciences.",

We suggest that teaching global health should prioritise the development skills and perspectives necessary to understand health and how it can be improved, which can be applied to any setting or context, and less about learning about health issues in low-income countries. Topics such as health equity, health systems and global health politics invariably generate discussion about students' local context and experiences, wherever they may be. We believe that separating such discussions between a local and a global context-particularly when it involves the common phrase in definitions of global health: 'those health issues that transcend national boundaries'-is counterproductive. It is not clear when a health issue transcends a national boundary, and frequently, understanding health issues in their national, subnational, historical, political, cultural and economic context is far more helpful, even if it is not 'somewhere else'. Therefore, we believe that it is crucial that the definition of global health moves beyond geographical boundaries. We interpret the word 'global' in its abstract sense-'of, relating to, or applying to a whole'. 6 Thus global health is about taking a holistic perspective of 'health', or about the disciplinary scope rather than its geographical reach.",

For example, the recent renaming of the Karolinska Institute Department of Global Public Health suggests that the separation between those working in global health and those working in local health is reducing. The elective Global Medicine course for medical students at Uppsala University offers students to remain in Sweden as opposed to going abroad to gain practical experience in global health. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of local and online global health learning activities replacing international travel. While such examples are promising, we propose further efforts to emphasise the global scope of health as opposed to the geographical reach. This includes getting students in our global health courses to reflect on health inequalities in their own society. We believe that the notion that global health is something that occurs abroad contributes to a demand for short international electives-usually presented without mention of ethical issues and their carbon footprint-while at the same time undercutting efforts to address health issues at home. Indeed, while there is great enthusiasm for 'doing global health' by travelling abroad to practise as a nurse or doctor, exceedingly few are interested in contributing to health equity at home. For example, primary care centres in deprived areas such as Roseng\u00e5rd, outside Malm\u00f6, Sweden, experience chronic vacancies.",

However, health issues exist, in varying degrees, in all communities, and improving health demands a 'global' view, in the widest sense of the word. We further propose that local study visits and trips should be encouraged, such as non-governmental organisations addressing social determinants of health, migration, and health centres and local health councils.",
