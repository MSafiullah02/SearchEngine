As of Mar 5, 2020, more than 80,000 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in China, while around 16,000 cases outside, of which the youngest was 30 h. All general people are vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly the population with relatively weaker immunity, including the minor, elderly, and pregnant women. Existing evidence demonstrated the person-to-person transmission, mostly at a family or a cluster [1], [2]. Respiratory droplets and close physical contact are thought to be the main transmission route, although the aerosols transmission is highly suspected recently. The possibility of mother-to-child transmission is of great concern to the obstetrics and neonatologist. However, due to the shortage of reagent for virus detection, a vast majority of patients only underwent oropharyngeal swab testing, which is not sufficient to prove or rule out the presence of mother-to-child transmission.",

The birth weight was 2.6 kg, and the Apgar score was 9 in 1 min and 10 in 5 min. The amniotic fluid was clear, and the grossing of the placenta was unremarkable. During the third trimester of pregnancy, the pregnant woman was admitted to the hospital because of the symptoms of fever, fatigue, shortness of breath. Her chest CT scan showed multiple patchy nodular opacities bilaterally, intermingled with ground-glass opacity in both sub-pleural spaces. On 6d of symptom onset, her throat swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is considered the causative agent of COVID-19, by means of the real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction with primers and probes targeting the ORF1ab and N gene. The mother was isolated in the hospital and received interferon nebulization, oral lopinavir, intravenous antibiotics, and oxygen supplement. Besides, she was given one single course of dexamethasone to promote fetal lung development, for the possibility of preterm delivery. The mother was not affected by hypertension, diabetes, or other pregnancy-associated complications throughout the pregnancy. She received the cesarean section on 7d of symptom onset. The entire procedure was done in a negative pressure operation room. The droplet, contact, and airborne precautions were implemented throughout the operation, including all medical staff wearing the N95 mask, goggles, gown, and gloves, and mother wearing an N95 mask and not in contact with her child. After delivery, the nucleic acid test from the mother's amniotic fluid, vaginal secretions, placenta, cord blood, serum, and breast milk were all negative (Table 1\n).",

Gentamycin and ampicillin were also empirically prescribed because of the significant elevation of white blood cells and procalcitonin, which was discontinued at 48 h due to negative blood and sputum cultures. This baby was successfully weaned from the nasal continuous positive airway pressure on 5d.

            "text": "A novel coronavirus was isolated from COVID-19 patients, which was initially named novel coronavirus-2019 and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the 7th coronavirus that could produce human infection, with the previous six species including 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3]. A recently published article showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a 79.5% identity with SARS-CoV and 96% with a bat coronavirus [1]. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are very similar to SARS [2], ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia. Vertical transmission is a common transmission routine for some contagious disease, by which the pathogens passed from mother to the child across the placenta, through direct contact during delivery, or in the breast milk. Some coronavirus, such as 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, are common respiratory viruses, which have proven to be characteristic of vertical transmission [4]. However, based on the limited evidence, the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus is still not confirmed [5], [6], [7], [8]. On Feb 5, 2020, a neonatal patient with COVID-19, born to a mother with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, was diagnosed based on a positive nucleic acid test from the oropharyngeal swab 30 h after birth. It raises concerns among obstetricians, neonatologists, and public health agencies about the possibility of mother-to-child transmission of this novel coronavirus. Medical experts said it could be a case where the infection was contracted in uterine, but it is also possible the baby was infected after birth from having close contact with the mother [9].",

The nucleic acid test was performed on pharyngeal swab samples collected from 9 neonates from 1 to 9 days after birth, and all tests were negative [10]. The similar results were presented on another subsequent study, which sent the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from 6 pregnant women with COVID-19 for nucleic acid test and all samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 [11]. In our case, amniotic fluid, vaginal secretions, placenta, cord blood, breast milk, venous blood from mother, and the throat and anal swab, sputum, venous blood, urine samples from the newborn were all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the published studies. These existing pieces of evidence are predictive of low risk of mother-to-child transmission for SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive tested case in the world, providing the most convincing evidence to the question of whether there is a mother-to-child vertical transmission of this novel coronavirus. However, the possibility of viral load influencing the transmission risk should be of concern. Published studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between the viral load of some viruses and their ability to spread from mother to child [12], [13]; it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics. In this case, we cannot estimate the mother's highest viral load before delivery, because she received the initial test on 6d of symptom onset, already after viral load reached the peak at 3 to 5d [14], [15], [16]. Therefore, at this time point, although the risk is minimal, it still cannot exclude the possibility that a much higher viral load might lead to vertical transmission.",
