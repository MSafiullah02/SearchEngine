Two other institutions with responsibilities for specific surveillance networks are the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \u201cProf. Dr. Matei Bals\u201d for HIV/AIDS and the Institute for Pneumology \u201cMarius Nasta\u201d for tuberculosis, but they did not directly participate in the PHARE project.",
