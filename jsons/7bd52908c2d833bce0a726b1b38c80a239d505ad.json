In human cells, the telomerase holoenzyme consists of a high-molecular weight complex with a template-containing RNA subunit, hTR, and protein components including the catalytic subunit human telomerase reverse transcriptase, hTERT. In addition, several additional molecules might play a role in regulating in vivo activity of telomerase such as the chaperone HSP90/p32. In most normal somatic cells telomerase activity is absent and telomere repeats are lost with cell division and with ageing. Telomere attrition beyond a certain threshold is assumed to uncap chromosome ends which subsequently induces DNA damage and onset of replicative senescence.
