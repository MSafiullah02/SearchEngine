Antigenic competition between high and low frequency T cells as well as between multiple antigens expressed at different levels and competing for presentation on shared antigen-presenting cells (APCs) may favor generation of lines dominated by responses to a single virus or to a restricted spectrum of viral antigens,11,12 thus limiting the antiviral coverage provided by a single T cell product. In addition, our current manufacturing process is complex, requiring infectious virus material (EBV/Adv), production of a clinical grade vector, and prolonged (10\u201312 weeks) in vitro culture.8,9 To address this latter problem some groups have evaluated more rapid approaches for producing T cell products for adoptive transfer. These include multimer selection to directly isolate virus-specific CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood,13 as well as the selection of cells based on cytokine production [interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)] or expression of activation markers (e.g., CD154) following antigen exposure.14,15,16 However, these approaches are expensive, require a large starting blood volume, which is not always available, particularly in the matched unrelated donor setting, and cannot be applied to viruses with low circulating T cell precursor frequencies.",

To determine whether the superior cell numbers were a consequence of improved T cell proliferation, enhanced survival, or the combination, cells were labeled with CFSE on day 0 and then analyzed every 2\u20133 days to measure cell doubling, while live and apoptotic/necrotic cells were distinguished by Annexin-PI staining (data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated no difference in the number of cell divisions from day 0\u20135. However, from day 5 onward cells cultured in cytokines continued to divide, whereas in their absence, cell division was reduced and viability was consistently lower (Figure 1b).

Our data confirm that IL4+7-supplemented cultures contained antigen-specific IFN\u03b3-producing T cells in both compartments (CD4+ 39.3% \u00b1 16.4%, CD8+ 22.2% \u00b1 2.2%), at levels substantially higher than in other conditions (no cytokine: CD4+ 2.3% \u00b1 3.9%, CD8+ 0.8% \u00b1 0.5%; IL15: CD4+ 1.7% \u00b1 1.4%, CD8+ 13.9% \u00b1 2.8% and IL2: CD4+ 2.2% \u00b1 3.1%, CD8+ 12.6% \u00b1 2.6%, n = 3). Similar results were obtained using pepmixes from subdominant Adv (Penton) and EBV (LMP2) viral antigens; indeed outgrowth of NK cells was even more evident in the IL2 and IL15-supplemented conditions (Supplementary Figure S1).",

Figure 2c shows that both the recognition of a given peptide and the magnitude of the response thereto were little changed by the antigen source. Finally, we compared the functional avidity of our polyclonal CTL lines by IFN\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) using log dilutions of the pp65 pepmix or epitope peptides (A2-NLV and A24-QYD) as a stimulus.

To determine whether antigenic competition would preclude pooling we segregated the pepmixes and stimulated PBMCs with minipools-containing pepmixes from (i) each virus; (ii) immunodominant (CMV, RSV, Flu, HHV6) and subdominant (Adv, EBV, BK) viruses; (iii) lytic (Adv, RSV, Flu) and latent (EBV, CMV, HHV6, BK) viruses, or (iv) a mastermix of all pepmixes (Figure 5a). There was no difference in either the rate of expansion (Supplementary Figure S4), the overall specificity or magnitude of the response directed against each antigen, irrespective of the composition of the stimulating pepmix pool (Figure 5b). Thus, all further studies used the mastermix (condition D). Figure 5c shows eight additional CTL lines with consistent multivirus specificity. The highest responses were seen against CMV-pp65 and Adv-Hexon (951.6 \u00b1 82.1 and 461.4 \u00b1 19.2 SFC/1 \u00d7 105 CTL) whereas activity against HHV6-U90, EBV-BZLF1 and EBV-LMP2 was weakest (26.9 \u00b1 4.2, 35.6 \u00b1 5, 39.6 \u00b1 2.6 SFC/1 \u00d7 105 CTL). Adv-Penton, Influenza-MP1, and RSV-F demonstrated intermediate response rates (191 \u00b1 13.7, 117.6 \u00b1 8.6, 90.1 \u00b1 10.3 SFC/1 \u00d7 105 CTL, respectively) (Figure 5c). The lines were polyclonal and polyfunctional with activity against the stimulating viruses detectable in both CD4+ and CD8+ fractions (Figure 5d), and reactive cells produced both IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 after stimulation, a profile associated with superior in vivo activity.20,21\nFigure 5e shows the results for one representative donor in whom 63% of all Adv, 55% of CMV, 40% of EBV, 46% of RSV, 36% of Influenza, and 28% of HHV6-specific CTLs produced both IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 after antigenic stimulation. Intracellular cytokine staining for IFN\u03b3 and/or TNF\u03b1 in a total of six CTL lines generated and screened showed that 67.7 \u00b1 13.3% of all T cells in multivirus cultures were antigen-specific (data not shown). This percentage is likely an underestimate since some virus-specific CTLs do not produce cytokines or produce effector cytokines other than IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. Finally, even though these CTLs had received only a single stimulation there was no evidence of alloreactivity, assessed by Cr51 release assay using HLA-mismatched PHA blasts as targets (Supplementary Figure S5), an important consideration if these cells are to be used for the treatment of allogeneic HSCT recipients.",

            "text": "In our present clinical trials of virus-specific T cells, we have used EBV-LCL, adenovectors and/or viral antigen-encoding DNA plasmids to generate virus-directed T cells.8,9,33 The use of full-length antigen ensures that CTL can be generated from all donors, irrespective of HLA, and that the antigen is physiologically processed by APCs and produces CTLs that recognize multiple CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes and have sufficient avidity to kill virus-infected targets. The induction of lines that recognize multiple epitopes also minimizes virus escape due to epitope loss and produces potent and sustained antiviral activity in vivo.34 However, the requirements for live virus/vectors are barriers to broader and late phase clinical studies, and also limit the number of pathogens to which a single T cell line can be directed.8,9 We therefore evaluated whether clinically applicable pepmixes could be used as an alternative. Though clinical studies using minimal epitope peptides as vaccines have resulted in immune tolerance or the activation of low avidity T cells, Melief and colleagues recently demonstrated improved results with long (22-45aa) peptides containing both CD4+ and CD8+ epitope sequences.35 They observed that these long peptides were processed endogenously, presented to T cells by APCs, and induced both helper and cytotoxic T cells, resulting in robust and effective CTL responses.35 Based on these data, we chose to use a whole antigen source in the form of overlapping peptide libraries, but for optimal induction of polyclonal CTL we compared peptides of different lengths (15mers, 20mers, and 30mers) for stimulation. When using Hexon, which is predominantly recognized by CD4+ T cells, as a model antigen we saw no difference in the phenotype, specificity or epitope breadth of our lines. However, Maecker and colleagues found that 20mers were suboptimal for activating pp65-directed CD8+ T cells.36 Thus, though still rather controversial, the optimal length of peptide for the activation of T cell lines containing both CD4+ and CD8+ cells appears to be 15aa. This analysis also highlights the differences between delivering peptides as a vaccine, where one relies on endogenous APCs to take up and process antigen versus in vitro T cell activation using professional APCs within PBMCs at optimal effector:target ratios, where peptides are either endogenously processed or edited by exoproteases following binding to cell surface HLA molecules.37,38,39,40 Given the ready clinical availability of pepmixes containing 15mer peptides that cover all possible CD8+ and the majority of CD4+ epitopes, we substituted this antigen source and were able to demonstrate equivalency to \u201cconventionally generated\u201d CTLs with respect to both epitope specificity and avidity.",

            "text": "We next addressed how best to extend the breadth of antigen/epitope specificities that could be accommodated within a single CTL line. Physiologically, T cells are activated when they receive signals from T-cell receptor stimulation (signal 1), costimulation (signal 2), and cytokines (signal 3). Our \u201cconventional CTLs\u201d are activated in the absence of exogenous cytokines, a deficit that appears to adversely affect their proliferative capacity in vitro and also increases their susceptibility to activation-induced cell death, likely resulting in a more restricted repertoire of epitope recognition. Consistent with this possibility, we found that both the frequency and breadth of cells with viral specificity could be increased by supplementing cultures with inflammatory and prosurvival cytokines at initiation. We chose to test cytokines that support cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo (IL2, IL15),41,42 as well as combinations (IL4+7) that also support the retention of a central memory phenotype, and promote the survival of activated T cells by upregulation of anti-apoptotic molecules e.g., Bcl-2.43,44,45,46 Only lines supplemented with IL4+7 selectively promoted the expansion and survival of both CD4+ and CD8+ virus-specific T cells recognizing multiple epitopes, a combination that should favor the subsequent sustained expansion of transferred cells in vivo.34 Of note, the induced cells were Th1-polarized despite exposure to IL4, a prototypic Th2 cytokine. Given the clinical availability of both cytokines and their safety in human clinical trials,47,48 IL4+7 fulfilled the requirements of the current study, however, other proinflammatory cytokines capable of mimicking the milieu present during viral infection may produce similar benefits. For example, von Rossum and colleagues recently reported that CD3/28-activated CD8+ T cells cultured in an inflammatory cocktail consisting of IL1+IL6+IL23 underwent significantly less cell death after activation as compared with cells activated in any of the cytokines alone or activated in the presence of IL12.49",

            "text": "The direct stimulation of PBMCs with pepmixes and culture in cytokine-supplemented conditions also allowed us to overcome a second major barrier to increasing the spectrum of viruses targeted in a single CTL line, namely antigenic competition resulting from the use of a common APC to simultaneously present multiple antigenic components from different viruses.8,9 Antigenic competition results both from limited access of peptides to HLA molecules and physical constraints on the simultaneous stimulation of both high and low frequency T cells.11,12 To overcome these issues, investigators have used artificial APCs that are engineered with molecules to provide the necessary T-cell receptor and co-stimulatory events required for immune synapse formation.50 However, to avoid the inevitable complexities and costs of introducing a gene-modified cellular product into the manufacturing process, we evaluated whether patient PBMCs themselves could act as both a source of antigen-presenting and responding cells. B cells, monocytes and macrophages may all have the capacity to present antigen to T cells and these APCs can utilize endo- and exopeptidases to liberate class I or class II epitopes from 15mer peptides. By taking advantage of these properties, we can avoid reliance on a single APC endogenously expressing multiple antigens at different levels as a shared T cell stimulator, and instead have a diverse group of APCs in which each cell has the potential to display a diverse repertoire of peptides, allowing sufficient access for both high and low frequency T cells. Thus, antigenic competition both within the APC and between T cells could be alleviated. As proof of principal we generated a single culture of T cells with reactivity for 15 antigens derived from 7 latent and lytic viruses (EBV, CMV, BK, HHV6, Adv, Flu, and RSV) using pooled pepmixes as a stimulus and saw no evidence of competition. Additional pathogens may be included in this platform, although ultimately APC numbers will likely eventually become limiting, thus additions must be performed in a stepwise manner and one must evaluate changes in the frequency and breadth of T cell recognition of all peptides in the mix.",

By seeding just 1.5 \u00d7 107 PBMCs in the G-Rex and a single in vitro stimulation we could regularly manufacture 1 \u00d7 108 CTLs within 10 days, with a >10-fold enrichment in virus-specific cells and a corresponding reduction in alloreactive T cells to levels observed in repetitively stimulated conventional CTLs, which have a proven safety record in vivo. Thus, using our new manufacturing technology we predict that multivirus-specific CTL will be safe for infusion after a single exposure to pepmixes and will provide broad spectrum antiviral protection without GvHD. Should additional cells be required, for example if banked virus-specific CTLs are established for 3rd party recipients, a second stimulation using pepmix-pulsed PHA blasts can expand the total number of CTLs without impairing their epitope specificity or breadth.",
