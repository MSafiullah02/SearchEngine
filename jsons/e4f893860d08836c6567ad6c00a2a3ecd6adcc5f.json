Neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease, but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection. In contrast, the role of memory CD8 T cells in protecting against a secondary RSV infection is less established. We recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following RSV infection, but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by IFN-\u03b3. To evaluate the ability of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology, mice with high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to RSV challenge. Neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following RSV challenge compared with IgG-treated controls. Neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication, which caused a substantial reduction in memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-\u03b3 production, directly resulting in survival. In contrast, therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity, mortality, or IFN-\u03b3 levels, despite significantly reducing lung viral titers. Therefore, only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection. Overall, our results have important implications for the development of future RSV vaccines.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] RSV causes an estimated 33 million acute lower respiratory tract infections annually in children under 5 years of age, with over three million episodes requiring hospitalization. 6 Despite the immense healthcare burden attributed to RSV infection, there is currently no licensed RSV vaccine. A lack of complete understanding of the correlates of immunity against RSV has remained a major impediment in RSV vaccine development. Neutralizing antibodies have been shown to reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease and thus remain an important goal of RSV vaccination. [7] [8] [9] [10] However, high levels of neutralizing antibodies are not able to prevent RSV-induced disease in all individuals. 11, 12 In addition, high neutralizing antibody titers alone are insufficient to prevent reinfection with RSV in infants, young children, and adults. 9, 11, [13] [14] [15] Therefore, RSV vaccines in which neutralizing antibodies are the sole immune mediator for preventing secondary infection will likely not provide long-term protection in all individuals.",

            "text": "In contrast to neutralizing antibodies, the protective capacity of cell-mediated immunity against RSV infection has received substantially less attention. It has been well established that CD8 T cells provide protection during an acute RSV infection by mediating viral clearance. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Thus, memory CD8 T cells may also provide protection against reinfection with RSV and may be desirable to elicit through vaccination. We recently evaluated the capacity for RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells to provide protection against secondary RSV infection in the absence of RSV-specific memory CD4 T cells and antibodies. 22 Utilizing a dendritic cell-Listeria monocytogenes (DC-LM) prime-boost immunization approach, high-magnitude, systemic memory CD8 T cells specific to the M2 82-90 (M2 82 ) immunodominant CD8 T cell epitope were generated in BALB/c mice. M2 82 -immunized mice exhibited a significant reduction in lung viral titers following RSV challenge compared with controls undergoing an acute RSV infection. However, despite enhanced viral clearance, M2 82 -immunized mice unexpectedly exhibited enhanced weight loss, pulmonary dysfunction, and mortality. The exacerbated morbidity and mortality observed in M2 82 -immunized mice was mediated by the rapid IFN\u03b3 production by memory CD8 T cells in the lung and airways. 22 These results indicate that CD8 T cell epitope-specific vaccinations could have detrimental consequences following a subsequent, natural RSV infection in humans. However, given the established capacity of neutralizing antibodies to prevent RSV-associated disease severity, it is likely that the combined induction of both memory CD8 T cells and neutralizing antibodies could be an efficacious vaccine strategy.",

Interestingly, D25 administration reduced weight loss and enhanced pause (Penh) to a greater degree than motavizumab treatment, correlating with the potency of their in vitro neutralizing activity (Fig. 1c, d) . 25 In contrast, mAb43-treated mice exhibited weight loss and parameters of pulmonary dysfunction similar to IgG control-treated mice (Fig. 1c-e) . Consistent with these results, neutralizing antibody treatment also provided protection against lung pathology as evaluated by histology. IgG-treated M2 82 -immunized mice exhibited extensive hyaline membrane formation (HM), scattered cellular debris, and leukocytes in airspaces, consistent with diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 1f , g; Supplementary Fig. 1) . 27, 28 In contrast, D25-treated mice showed rare evidence of HM but extensive perivascular aggregation of leukocytes (PVA), an indicator of acute lung inflammation, compared to IgG treatment ( Fig. 1f-h; Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Thus, while D25-treated mice demonstrate acute lung inflammation, their lungs are significantly protected against the more severe lung pathology associated with diffuse alveolar damage observed in IgG-treated mice. Overall, these results suggest that pre-existing neutralizing antibodies provide protection against memory CD8 T cell-mediated weight loss, pulmonary dysfunction, and severe lung pathology and completely prevent mortality following RSV infection.",

We observed an increase in the total number of memory CD8 T cells in the lungs by day 4 p.i. in IgG-treated M2 82 -immunized mice (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, treatment with either mAb43 or D25 resulted in significantly increased numbers of memory CD8 T cells in the lung compared with IgG controls, while motavizumabtreated mice exhibited a trending, but not significant, elevation ( Fig. 3a) . Similar results were observed with both the total number of memory CD8 T cells in the lung expressing the surrogate activation marker CD11a and memory CD8 T cells specific to the M2 82 CD8 T cell epitope (Fig. 3b, c) . 29 This is consistent with the increased PVA observed by histology, suggesting an increase in trafficking to the lung on day 4 p.i. in D25-treated mice compared with IgG controls (Fig. 1f, g) . In addition, the total number of M2 82 - g h specific memory CD8 T cells in the BAL were similar between IgG-, mAb43-, motavizumab-, and D25-treated mice following RSV infection (Fig. 3d) . These results suggest that although prophylactic neutralizing antibody treatment restricts early virus replication, it does not significantly impact the expansion of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung and airways following RSV infection. We next determined the impact of neutralizing antibody treatment on the reactivation of M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cells following RSV infection. Memory CD8 T cells rapidly upregulate activation markers including CD25 and CD69 after secondary infection. 30 Therefore, we evaluated the expression of CD25 and CD69 on RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung as a measure of their activation status. M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cells expressed low levels of both CD25 and CD69 in the lung prior to secondary RSV infection on day 0 p.i. (Fig. 4b, d) . Control IgG and mAb43-treated M2 82 -immunized mice exhibited upregulation of CD25 expression on day 2 p.i., which was significantly elevated compared with either motavizumab-or D25-treated mice ( Fig. 4a, b) . IgG treatment resulted in significantly increased CD25 expression compared with mAb43, motavizumab, and D25 treatment on day 4 p.i. in the lung (Fig. 4a, b) . Similar to CD25 expression, IgG and mAb43 administration resulted in an increase in CD69 expression compared with either motavizumab or D25 treatment on day 2 p.i., although the increase compared with motavizumab-treated mice did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4c, d) . Overall, these results suggest that while neutralizing antibody treatment does not impact the accumulation of M2 82specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung, it substantially reduces their reactivation.",

Memory CD8 T cells in IgG-treated mice robustly produced IFN-\u03b3 in the lung on day 2 p.i. compared with mock controls administered PBS (Fig. 5a,  b) . Similarly, mAb43 treatment did not significantly alter the frequency of memory CD8 T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 on day 2 p.i. (Fig. 5a, b) . In contrast, administration of either motavizumab or D25 neutralizing antibodies substantially reduced the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells on day 2 p.i. compared with IgGtreated mice, with D25 treatment resulting in less than 5% of IFN\u03b3 + CD8 T cells in the lung (Fig. 5a, b) . Similar results were observed when evaluating IFN-\u03b3 production by M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung on day 2 p.i. (Fig. 5c ). M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cell IFN-\u03b3 production on day 4 p.i. was decreased compared with day 2 p.i. in all treatment groups, which is consistent with our previous data (Fig. 5c) . 22 In contrast to the lung, mAb43 treatment Fig. 1 Prophylactic neutralizing antibody treatment prevents memory CD8 T cell-mediated morbidity and mortality. a Schematic depicting immunization protocol and antibody administration.

Motavizumab and D25 treatment also significantly reduced the IFN-\u03b3 production by M2 82 -specific CD8 T cells in the BAL (Fig. 5d) . These results suggest that neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduces the capacity of memory CD8 T cells in the lung and airway to produce IFN-\u03b3 following secondary RSV infection. We previously demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 mediated the exacerbated morbidity and mortality observed following RSV infection in M2 82 -immunized mice. 22 Here, we have shown that M2 82immunized mice treated prophylactically with neutralizing antibodies exhibited significantly reduced IFN-\u03b3 levels and memory CD8 T cell IFN-\u03b3 production compared with IgG-treated controls. Given these results, we evaluated whether the lack of IFN-\u03b3 in mice treated with neutralizing antibodies was the mechanism leading to their survival following RSV challenge. To demonstrate that low IFN-\u03b3 production resulted in protection against morbidity and mortality, IgG-, motavizumab-, and D25-treated M2 82 -immunized mice were administered either recombinant IFN-\u03b3 protein or PBS following RSV challenge and monitored daily for morbidity and mortality (Fig. 6a) . Mice were treated systemically with four doses of recombinant IFN-\u03b3 every 12 h starting 12 h p.i. to mimic the rapid and robust induction of IFN-\u03b3 protein levels in both the lung and serum of M2 82 -immunized mice (Fig. 2b, c) . As expected, IgG-treated M2 82 -immunized mice administered recombinant IFN\u03b3 exhibited similar mortality, weight loss, and pulmonary dysfunction as PBS controls (Fig. 6b-e) . Consistent with our results in Fig. 1 , M2 82 -immunized mice treated with either motavizumab or D25 and administered PBS were completely protected against mortality and experienced reduced weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction compared with IgG controls (Fig. 6b-e) . Remarkably, motavizumab-and D25-treated mice administered recombinant IFN-\u03b3 exhibited increased mortality following RSV challenge in contrast to their PBS control counterparts (Fig. 6b ). In addition, IFN-\u03b3 administration resulted in a significant increase in weight loss and Penh, and a trending increase in MVb compared with PBS controls in both motavizumab-and D25-treated M2 82 -immunized mice (Fig. 6c-e) . These results clearly demonstrate that the substantially decreased IFN-\u03b3 levels induced in neutralizing antibody-treated mice resulted in their protection against memory CD8 T cell-mediated morbidity and mortality. Overall, our data indicates that pre-existing neutralizing antibodies provide protection against memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology by preventing early virus replication, which results in reduced memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-\u03b3 production.",

M2 82 -immunized mice were challenged with RSV, treated with control IgG, mAb43, motavizumab, and D25 antibodies i.p. 1 day later, and monitored daily for morbidity and mortality (Fig. 7a) . Similar to what was observed with prophylactic treatment, mAb43 administration 1 day following infection did not prevent memory CD8 T cellmediated mortality (Fig. 7b) . Surprisingly, therapeutic treatment with either motavizumab or D25 after RSV infection also did not substantially alter the survival of M2 82 -immunized mice compared with IgG-treated controls (Fig. 7b) . Although motavizumab treatment reduced the percentage of mice succumbing to RSV infection to 50% mortality compared with the 90% observed in IgG-treated mice, this change was not statistically significant (p = 0.07) (Fig. 7b) . In addition to failing to prevent mortality, therapeutic neutralizing antibody treatment also did not ameliorate memory CD8 T cell-mediated weight loss or pulmonary dysfunction, as both motavizumab-and D25-treated mice exhibited disease symptoms that were nearly identical to those treated with either control IgG or mAb43 (Fig. 7c-e) . This was in stark contrast to what we observed with prophylactic neutralizing antibody treatment (Fig. 1b-e) . Similarly, naive mice given neutralizing antibody treatment 1 day after a primary RSV infection exhibited significantly decreased weight loss and Penh compared with IgG-treated controls ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . These results indicate that therapeutic neutralizing antibody treatment is sufficient to reduce T cell-mediated disease during a primary RSV infection, but is too late to prevent the accelerated immunopathology induced following a secondary RSV challenge in mice with pre-existing memory CD8 T cell immunity. These results suggest that although pre-existing neutralizing antibodies efficiently provide protection in M2 82 -immunized mice, therapeutic treatment after RSV infection is not sufficient to overcome the rapid induction of memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology.",

Therefore, neutralizing antibody administration even 1 day p.i. was too late to prevent immunopathology mediated by robust memory CD8 T cell responses.

            "text": "Despite binding to the RSV F protein with high affinity, mAb43 does not exhibit neutralizing activity against RSV in vitro. 26 Consistent with these results, mAb43 administration both prior to and following RSV infection did not impact morbidity and mortality in M2 82 -immunized mice. However, our data indicate that mAb43 exerts some function in M2 82 -immunized mice following RSV infection, and is not biologically inert. mAb43treated mice exhibited a significant reduction in lung viral titers on day 2 p.i. compared with IgG controls. Similarly, prophylactic mAb43 administration resulted in significantly reduced lung and serum IFN-\u03b3 levels on day 2 p.i. compared with IgG-treated mice. In contrast, mAb43 administration prior to RSV infection did not significantly alter CD8 T cell activation and IFN-\u03b3 production. These results suggest that mAb43 contributes to reducing the early inflammatory response in M2 82 -immunized mice independently of the CD8 T cell response. In addition to direct antibody-mediated pathogen neutralization, antibodies may contribute to viral clearance by complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through activity of their crystallizable fragment (Fc) domains. 32 Antibody Fc domains can form immune complexes that activate the complement system, resulting in the recruitment of phagocytes, opsonization, and assembly of the membrane attack complex to destroy infected target cells. 33, 34 Antibody immune complex-mediated activation of complement has been previously implicated in the exacerbation of vaccineenhanced disease following RSV challenge of formalin-inactivated RSV-immunized mice. 35 ADCC is mediated by antibodies binding to Fc receptors expressed on NK cells, which triggers the release of perforin and granzymes to eliminate infected target cells. ADCC contributes to antibody-mediated protection against other respiratory viruses, including influenza virus. 36 Further, human RSV-specific antibodies exhibit potent ADCC activity in vitro. 37 Thus, mAb43 administration may be contributing to the reduction of lung viral titers through either complement activation or ADCC. Motavizumab is the affinity-optimized, next-generation monoclonal antibody of its predecessor, palivizumab that binds to site II on both the pre-F and post-F confirmations of the RSV F protein. 23, 38 Indeed, motavizumab exhibited 10-20-fold higher in vitro neutralizing activity than palivizumab. 23, 38 In addition, motavizumab demonstrated 3-4-fold higher potency compared with palivizumab in the elimination of RSV titers in vivo in cotton rats. 23 More recently, the monoclonal antibody D25 was identified, which binds with high affinity to site \u2205 exclusively on the pre-F confirmation. 24,25 D25 exhibited significantly increased in vitro neutralizing activity compared with either palivizumab or motavizumab. 24, 25 Further optimization of D25 yielded the highly potent, humanized monoclonal antibody, MEDI18897. 39 MEDI18897 demonstrated in vitro neutralizing activity that was 20-fold and 150-fold more potent than motavizumab and palivizumab, respectively. 39 Furthermore, MEDI18897 was ninefold more potent than palivizumab at inhibiting RSV replication in cotton rats. 39 Together, these results indicate that antibodies specific exclusively to the pre-F confirmation are more effective than those capable of binding to both the pre-F and post-F forms. In addition to exerting higher neutralizing activity, our results suggest that antibodies specific to pre-F are more effective at preventing memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection in mice. Motavizumab-treated mice exhibited nearly 20% body weight loss and notable elevations in Penh from baseline, although these parameters were significantly reduced compared with IgG controls at multiple days following infection. In contrast, D25 treatment nearly eliminated all clinical disease manifestations, as little change in weight loss and Penh values from baseline were observed. Therefore, although both motavizumab and D25 are capable of preventing memory CD8 T cell-mediated mortality following RSV infection, D25 is more efficacious in reducing clinical disease symptoms, including weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that the severe memory CD8 T cellmediated disease observed following RSV infection can be prevented by the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. Thus, vaccines developed to induce high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells in combination with neutralizing antibody responses may be efficacious while maintaining a suitable safety profile. Our results are consistent with those observed in human clinical trials evaluating either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment with RSVspecific neutralizing antibodies in infants. Phase III clinical trials demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with either palivizumab or motavizumab resulted in reduced RSV-associated hospitalization rates in pre-term infants. 40, 41 In contrast, therapeutic administration of either palivizumab or motavizumab to RSVinfected infants after hospitalization did not alter disease severity and the duration of hospitalization compared with placebotreated RSV-infected infants. 42, 43 Thus, only pre-existing RSVspecific neutralizing antibodies are sufficient to reduce RSVassociated disease in humans, similar to our results reported here evaluating RSV-specific memory CD8 T cell-mediated disease in mice. Given the demonstrated ability for prophylactic administration of neutralizing antibodies to prevent RSV-associated disease in humans, it is likely that they will also be capable of mitigating potentially pathological responses mediated by human memory CD8 T cells. Overall, our findings suggest that eliciting both neutralizing antibodies and memory CD8 T cells may be an effective strategy for the development of future CD8 T cell epitope-based vaccines against RSV. Prime-boost immunizations M2 82 -specific memory CD8 T cells were induced using a DC-LM prime-boost immunization regimen as previously described. 22 Briefly, LPS-matured DCs were pulsed with M2 82-90 peptide and sorted via positive selection with anti-CD11c microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Naive BALB/c mice were primed with 5 \u00d7 10 5 DC-M2 82 intravenously (i.v.) and boosted 7 days later i.v. with 5 \u00d7 10 6 recombinant actA-deficient LM expressing the M2 82-90 epitope.",

For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stained for surface markers as indicated above and subsequently stained intracellularly for IFN-\u03b3 (clone XMG1.2) in FACS buffer containing 0.5% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. All antibodies were purchased from eBioscience unless otherwise indicated. Samples were run on a BD LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). Cell types were phenotyped as follows: CD8 T cells (CD90.2 + CD8 + ), CD4 T cells (CD90.2 + CD4 + ), B cells (CD3 \u2212 CD19 + B220 + ), NK cells (CD3 \u2212 CD49b + NKp46 + ), monocytes (Ly6G \u2212 Siglec F \u2212 SSC-A lo MHC class II lo CD64 hi CD11b hi ), dendritic cells (Ly6G \u2212 Siglec F -CD11c + MHCII + ), and neutrophils (Siglec F \u2212 Ly6G + ).",

Data were evaluated using either a one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer's post test for more than two groups to determine a statistical significance of at least \u03b1 = 0.05 as indicated in the figure legends. Fig. 8 Therapeutic neutralizing antibody treatment inhibits early virus replication, but does not impact lung and serum IFN-\u03b3 levels. M2 82 -immunized mice were challenged with RSV and treated with IgG, mAb43, motavizumab, or D25 antibodies i.p. one day later. a Lungs were harvested on days 2 and 4 p.i., and plaque assays were performed to determine RSV titers. b-c Lungs were harvested on days 0, 2, and 4 p.i., and IFN-\u03b3 protein levels in the (b) lung and (c) serum were determined by ELISA. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM of two independent experiments (n = 8 for day 2 and n = 10 for day 4). Dashed lines indicate the limit of detection of each assay. Groups were compared using a two-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.",
