As such, the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases is sometimes perceived to be the responsibility of the clinical realm. Yet, the reality is that both nonclinical and clinical public health responses are required\u2014and sometimes we need to relax professional boundaries to work collaboratively for the health and wellbeing of our communities. We need to work in partnership with health surveillance teams, epidemiologists, environmental health scientists, public health physicians, infectious disease physicians, general practitioners, nurses, allied health professions, health policy\u2010makers, health planners, health geographers and many others, to reduce the risks associated with pandemics. We also need to work across sectors to achieve the best possible outcomes.",

Messaging about health and hygiene, particularly hand\u2010washing, is one example of the role that health promotion has played\u2014ultimately drawing on our expertise in delivering health education, and implementing health\u2010related mass media and social marketing campaigns. Over the last two decades, information technology and social media have transformed the way we can reach people during pandemics. Indeed, social media has catapulted the ability to reach large populations, while also simultaneously targeting vulnerable and at\u2010risk populations, to deliver health messages, such as those associated with hand\u2010washing. Over the past few weeks, there has been a steady flow of memes urging people to wash their hands, often with thoughtful use of graphics alongside a successful use of humour. JS's personal favourite, was an online post from Round Rock Texas that read: \u2018Texas Coronavirus Protection\u2014wash your hands like you just got done slicing jalapenos for a batch of nachos and you need to take your contacts out (that's like 20 seconds scrubbing, y'all)\u2019. It delivers an essential public health message in a factual, yet contextually relevant and humorous way. However, social media can also have its pitfalls. Misinformation and fake news are rampant. This has the potential to stifle health promotion efforts in times of need, such as during the current COVID\u201019 pandemic. Therefore, it is important to know who is saying what, why, and with what level of authority.",

As an example, JS received 12 emails from his children's schools and 14 from his current workplaces about COVID\u201019\u2014a total of 26 emails from educational institutions in both Australia and the United States. Email topics ranged from: hygiene issues such as hand washing and sanitiser use; social distancing, self\u2010isolation and self\u2010quarantining strategies such as cancellation of school activities and fundraisers; proposed adoption of online learning options, and flexibility about attendance at school/work, including possible closures; travel restrictions imposed by schools and universities associated with concerts, plays, public events/seminars and conferences; guidance to limit travel on public transport; and advice about when to seek help and access local health services if myself or my family members experience symptoms associated with COVID\u201019. This bombardment of communication, albeit extremely useful, emphasises the importance of coordination in key messaging between health, education and various other sectors, when planning and implementing effective pandemic responses.",

We also need to be careful how we convey content through electronic communication channels and consider an appropriate level of frequency of such communication to achieve optimal impact. Without doing so, there is potential to reinforce community ambivalence at one end of the spectrum and create panic at the other. The recent toilet paper saga in Australia, whereby stocks of toilet paper were rapidly depleted from grocery stores in response to the perceived likelihood of home quarantining measures, is one such example (albeit somewhat humorous and embarrassing). Panic buying like this reinforces the powerful ramifications of communication gone wrong. Health literacy research that embraces new and emerging technologies will be particularly important to guide online health promotion efforts of this nature in the future.",

The Australian Government has since committed a $2.4 billion health package to protect all Australians from COVID\u201019, including vulnerable groups such as the elderly, those with chronic conditions and Indigenous communities.\n5\n The US Government pledged $50 billion on the same day. Importantly, the Australian health package includes $30 million for implementing an information campaign to provide people with practical advice on how they can play their part in containing the virus and staying healthy.\n5\n We trust health promotion professionals with expertise in health literacy, health communication, and social marketing will be consulted throughout its development. We also trust that health promoters will be involved in the multi\u2010million dollar primary care and research responses outlined by the Australian Prime Minister.",

While COVID\u201019 has the potential to impact everyone in society, these impacts will be felt differentially. That is, the way we prepare, protect, treat, reduce transmission and innovate, needs to be viewed from a health equity lens. It is essential to recognise that pandemics\u2014and the respective Government and corporate decisions that emanate\u2014both influence and are influenced by social, economic and political determinants of health. As the WHO Director\u2010General has recently stated\u2014\u2018all countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights\u2019.\n3\n However, knowing what this \u2018fine balance\u2019 constitutes can be difficult.

While hand\u2010washing is a significant health promotion intervention, it can also act as a useful fa\u00e7ade for advancing actions that enhance equitable social and economic outcomes for those most vulnerable during pandemics. The WHO has encouraged us to think innovatively.\n1\n, \n3\n The health promotion profession can lead this charge and advocate for a national public health social media campaign and other pragmatic measures that reach people most in need.
