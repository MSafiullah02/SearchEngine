Patients were aged 11-84 years, and the median age of patients was 47.13 years. The percentage of male patients was 52.94%. Consistent with previous studies, many patients had fever (80.88%), cough (73.53%), and sputum (32.36%) upon admission. The prevalence of other symptoms (e.g., headache, diarrhea) was relatively low (Supplementary Table 1 ). The clinical features of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was consistent with those reported by Chen and colleagues. 4 Upon admission, the neutrophil count was remarkably higher in SD patients than in MD cases, whereas the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in SD cases than in MD cases. The concentration of total bilirubin, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase in blood was higher in SD patients than that in MD patients. Levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were slightly higher in SD cases than those in MD cases. Levels of albumin and hemoglobin were lower in SD patients than those in MD patients (Supplementary Table 2 ). Specifically, T cell and CD8 + T cell counts were decreased significantly in MD and SD patients compared with those in healthy controls (HCs). The number of T cells and CD8 + T cells was significantly lower in SD patients than that in MD cases. The counts of NK cells were reduced remarkably in SD patients compared with those in MD cases and HCs (Fig. 1a) .",

Comparison of the total number of cytotoxic lymphocytes (including CTLs and NK cells) after therapy was carried out. The total number of T cells and NK cells recovered in the convalescent period in four of the five patients, and the total count of CTLs was restored in the convalescent period in three of the five patients (Fig. 1d) . Hence, efficacious therapy was accompanied by an increased number of T cells, CTLs, and NK cells. Importantly, the percentage of NKG2A + NK cells was decreased in the convalescent period compared with that before treatment among five patients.

Also, the percentage of NKG2A + cytotoxic lymphocytes was decreased in recovered patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, which strongly suggests that NKG2A expression may be correlated with functional exhaustion of cytotoxic lymphocytes and disease progression in the early stage of COVID-19. Although exhaustion of T and NK cells occurs in human chronic infection and tumorigenesis, T cell apoptosis (which is regarded as the host mechanism involved in chronic infection and cancer) also occurs in SARS-CoV infection. 7 Thus exhausted NKG2A + cytotoxic lymphocytes may be present in COVID-19 patients. With regard to our finding that the percentage of NKG2A + cytotoxic lymphocytes was decreased after antiviral therapy in COVID-19 patients, efficacious control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is related to reduce expression of NKG2A on cytotoxic lymphocytes. Therefore, in COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary inflammation, SARS-CoV-2-induced NKG2A expression may be correlated with functional exhaustion of cytotoxic lymphocytes at the early stage, which may result in disease progression. Moreover, immune inhibitory \"checkpoint\" receptors that result in exhaustion of NK and T cells have been demonstrated in chronic infection and cancer. Importantly, checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT help to reinvigorate exhausted responses from T or NK cells in the context of chronic infection and cancer. 8, 9 NKG2A is thought to be a novel inhibitory molecule on immune-checkpoint blockade. 10 Taken together, these data highlight the importance of improving the immune response of NK cells and CTLs and avoiding exhaustion of cytotoxic lymphocytes at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, targeting NKG2A may prevent the functional exhaustion of cytotoxic lymphocytes and consequently contribute to virus elimination in the early stage of SRAS-CoV-2 infection. b Percentages of NKG2A + NK cells and NKG2A + CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood of healthy controls (n = 25) and patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 68). c Expression of intracellular CD107a, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and granzyme-B in gated NK cells and CD8 + T cells and percentage of TNF-\u03b1 + NK cells in the peripheral blood of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and healthy controls. d Total number of T cells, CTLs, and NK cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and convalescing patients. e Percentages of NKG2A + NK cells and NKG2A + CTL in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and convalescing patients.
