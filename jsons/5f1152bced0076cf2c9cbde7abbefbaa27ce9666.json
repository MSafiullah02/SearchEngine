We focus on implications for local microfinance institutions in Pakistan, a country with a mature microfinance sector, serving a large number of households. The institutions serve populations poorly-served by traditional commercial banks, helping customers invest in microenterprises, save, and maintain liquidity. We report results from 'rapid response' phone surveys of about 1,000 microenterprise owners, a survey of about 200 microfinance loan officers, and interviews with regulators and senior representatives of microfinance institutions. We ran these surveys starting about a week after the country went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. We find that, on average, week-on-week sales and household income both fell by about 90%. Households' primary immediate concern in early April became how to secure food. As a result, 70% of the sample of current microfinance borrowers reported that they could not repay their loans; loan officers anticipated a repayment rate of just 34% in April 2020. We build from the results to argue that COVID-19 represents a crisis for microfinance in low-income communities. It is also a chance to consider the future of microfinance, and we suggest insights for policy reform.",

Who is regulated by whom shapes who is accountable to whomand also who is in line for help. In Pakistan, 'microfinance banks' (MFBs) take deposits and are regulated by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), and tend to serve somewhat better-off customers. 'Microfinance non-bank financial companies' (NBFCs) are not allowed to hold deposits, and their regulation is relatively light. 7 Most of the NBFCs were once NGOs, and they include organizations that serve relatively poor communities. The present crisis makes the trade-offs between levels of regulation and access to support from regulators much more explicit: the NBFCs are not connected to the State Bank of Pakistan, most likely the lender of last resort, 8 yet they are the organizations serving the most vulnerable populations and are plausibly most in need of support.",

            "text": "Third, a basic principle of bank regulation is that serious oversight is needed for deposit-taking institutions but not for others. The idea is that deposit-taking institutions (like Pakistan's MFBs) hold the money of citizens, and the government has an interest in ensuring that the money will be available to the population when needed. A corollary explains why NBFCs are not regulated by the State Bank of Pakistan. One line of thinking is that if the NBFCs collapse, borrowers do not lose their money, since they hold deposits elsewhere. Instead, borrowers might even come out ahead, since the lender may be unable to collect loan obligations. But the crisis shows that this regulatory distinction provides an unreliable guide. Even microfinance institutions that do not take deposits need regulatory oversight, particularly with consumer protection in mind. The early days of the COVID-19 crisis in Pakistan reveal why such regulation (by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan) is so important. We document instances of problems with loan officers in which customerswho were in highly vulnerable positionswere left confused about their obligations and means of recourse. Industry efforts to promote self-regulation are laudable, but they 7 NBFCs are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). 8 The State Bank of Pakistan actively monitors the liquidity position of MFBs, and has reported to us that there are no signs of liquidity problems as of mid-April 2020. In order to provide a buffer for MFBs to absorb liquidity shocks, the SBP requires them to hold a cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 5% and a statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of 10% of their deposits (consisting of both time and demand liabilities). are imperfect substitutes for real regulation with real teeth. 9 Moreover, the idea that the collapse of lenders won't hurt borrowers ignores how important maintaining liquidity is in low-income economies.",

            "text": "Fourth, best practices in normal times can be bad practices during a crisis. One example is the way that loan officers are paid, sometimes with large incentives intended to motivate hard work and to maximize effort. In most MFIs, a significant proportion of the total income earned by loan officers is comprised of performance-related payments based on new loan disbursements and the repayment of existing loans (Pakistan Microfinance Network, 2019) . Economists call these 'high-powered incentives', and they make sense when objectives are clear and those objectives are aligned with the best outcomes for communities. In normal times, they enhance the efficiency of organisations. But these are not normal times, and these circumstances may now call for 'low-powered incentives' in which loan officers are paid a steady income that is not closely tied to loan disbursements and collections. This lets loan officers focus on helping customers in the most effective ways without having to worry about their own earnings. 10 With high-powered incentives still in place, the data we have collected suggests that some loan officers are still demanding repayments from customers, even when senior staff have established policies creating repayment moratoriums.",

Communication should be transparent, and loan officers should be given incentives to put customers' needs first. Microfinance institutions need to limit their losses, but for their struggling customers microfinance debt obligations may serve to heap further misery upon an intolerable situation. Some microfinance institutions have taken steps to provide charitable resources during the crisis. Some loans may need to be written off.

Typically, microfinance clients have a poverty score between 35 and 60. There is just one large microfinance institution that specifically targets as clients households with poverty scores between 16.17 and 35. 13 Portfolio at risk (over a 30 day period) has also been low, at about 1.6% of the gross loan portfolio (Pakistan Microfinance Network, 2019) . Of all loans, approximately 70% are structured as individual-liability. 14 The NBFCs can further be divided into non-bank microfinance institutions (of which there are 25), and the Rural Support Programmes (of which there are 10). Rural Support Programmes differ from other NBFCs in that they have a purely rural focus; like other NBFCs, they are not permitted to accept deposits. 15 On the regulation of MFBs by the SBP, see the Prudential Regulations for Microfinance Banks (2014) and the Financial Consumer Protection Circular (2014). On the regulation of NBFCs by the SECP, see the amendment to the Non-Banking Finance Companies (Establishment and Regulation) Rules (2003) and the Non-Banking Finance Companies and Notified Entities Regulations, 2008. portfolio; about 80% of the total outreach of the sector can be attributed to a combination of eight MFBs and two NBFCs. MFBs' primary source of funding is public deposits, with borrowing constituting less than 10% (borrowing is mostly from local banks and development finance institutions). About 75% of funds for NBFCs come from debt, provided mainly from the apex funding agency, the Pakistan Microfinance Investment Company (PMIC); owing to strict guarantee requirements and currency risks, local commercial banks loans and international loans comprise a relatively small proportion of total debt in the sector (Pakistan Microfinance Network, 2019 Basharat and Sheikh, 2019) . 16",

By not extending the relief to loans that were previously categorised as non-performing (many of which were still generating partial repayments), this negatively affects profitability as these technically non-performing loans (NPL) gradually move across 'NPL buckets' (from '30 days overdue' to '60 days overdue', and so on). size was $304 and median $260).

In Figure 6 (in the appendix), we compare sales in the week before the lockdown to sales in the week preceding that; we find that the relationship was remarkably stable, with the best fit lying close to the 45-degree line. 22 It should be noted that loan officers do not map directly to microenterprises, in that we did not attempt to match them to microenterprise's regions; nonetheless, this provides a useful piece of information, and demonstrates that loan officers do have a reasonably good sense of clients' performance both in absolute terms and in terms of the impact of the lockdown. To further explore the types of microenterprise that experienced a complete shutdown, we created a dummy variable for having experienced a 100% decrease in sales; we then regressed this on demographic variables and business characteristics. We findunsurprisinglythat businesses selling food or operating general retail stores and kiosks were less likely to experience a complete shutdown. 23 We also find that female-run businesses were 8 percentage points more likely to experience a 100% decrease in business revenue than those run by men, even after controlling for sector and MFI fixed effects (a result that is statistically significant with p = 0.034).

Almost no borrowers suggested that they were able to repay their loan partially; this may reflect the practical reality that MFIs do not typically offer a mechanism for part-repayment. 27 We also asked loan officers what the repayment rates were for their loan portfolios in February, March and April. The average repayment rate in February was 98%, decreasing to 81% in March (which partially reflects the effect of the lockdown in the third week of the month), and significantly decreasing to 34% predicted in April. As described in Section 4.5, these numbers are consistent with the predictions given by CEOs on their overall portfolio repayment rates.

In general, it seems that compliance with the CIB rules was high amongst MFBs and NBFCs, but the rules stipulate that smaller loans are not subject to reporting, which makes it difficult to know exactly how indebted borrowers are and from how many institutions they are taking smaller loans.

Specifically, the policy that allows deferral of principal while continuing to collect interest may not be feasible due to the small notional amounts of the loans, which imply a very small monthly interest payment.

MFI Transparency (2011) explains: \"The flat rate calculation method has become prevalent in markets where there is a lack of transparency and the mechanisms to facilitate it. The flat rate allows financial institutions to advertise costs that are nearly twice as high as they appear. To most borrowers, especially those with minimal financial education, the flat rate seems cheaper. Once one institution begins to calculate their prices this way it is difficult for others to compete using a declining balance rate that appears higher but may actually be less expensive. For example, a lender using declining balance calculation must set the interest rate as high as 56.3% per year to collect the same amount of total interest payment as another one who is using a 36% per year flat rate. Without policy or standards in place to prevent this, institutions must resort to non-transparent practices in order to be competitive.\" 38 Those MFIs for whom this applied stated that the accruing of interest was necessary for them and reflected the cost of keeping the loans active and staying in touch with clients.",

While many MFIs mentioned better risk-sharing in the instruments that provide them with capital, and some suggested that clients also need to be provided with better risk-sharing in terms of products they are offered, the overwhelming call by MFBs in particular was for a credit guarantee scheme (CGS). Such a scheme would offer risk sharing to lenders by taking a portion of the lenders' losses in the event of loan defaults. A CGS can provide risk mitigation either by sharing losses on a pari passu basis between the CGS and the lender, and / or with the CGS covering a fixed percentage of the first loss. Our interviews with senior representatives at the State Bank of Pakistan revealed that such a CGS had 39 Many of our enumerators highlighted a concern that loan officers only expressed to them informally while conducting the interviews --that they will be losing a large share of their own incomes. Many MFIs structure their loan officer salaries to include high-powered incentives: a bonus based on repayment rates and new disbursements.

Effectively coping with a volatile and unpredictable income is made easier by ready access to financial services, but the small transactions begotten by low incomes combined with fixed administrative costs make it exceedingly difficult for the market to provide those services. That has historically been the rock on which attempts to bring low-income households into the formal financial services market have crashed. 40 The Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility, involving both first-loss and pari passu loss sharing, was meant to facilitate wholesale funding to the microfinance industry under a risk-sharing mechanism.

Further, a CGS is being offered by the SBP for Micro, Small Medium Enterprises (MSME) through participating financial institutions, which include both MFBs and commercial banks. We have been informed that this facility will shortly be spun off into the Pakistan Credit Guarantee Company (PCGC), which is being established to facilitate affordable risk sharing solutions for the MSME sector. 41 For details, see https://dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/Access-to-Finance/ SME-Credit-Guarantee-Scheme/.

Our interviews with microfinance leaders indicate a high level of sophistication and well-reasoned thinking about possible solutions; further, even if such leaders overestimate the value of a CGS, the fact that they mention this as a way to help them recover from the crisis and provide them with greater confidence in disbursing capital to clients who need it (for example, those in sectors not as adversely affected by the crisis, such as agriculture), and to those businesses that are expected to bounce back quickly, suggests that a CGS is worth considering as a policy option.",

Recognizing that microfinance is primarily about managing liquidity has many implications, especially for regulation and oversight.",

When investment loans become unavailable, growth is certainly a casualty and recession is likely. But when sources of 43 There are, of course, households and microenterprises that use microcredit to invest in business assets, as demonstrated in a number of studiesbut those same studies show that the majority of clients use funds in ways that do not materially increase revenues or profits; clients often spend primarily on inventory or other working capital rather than on capital investments that increase their profitability (Banerjee et al., 2019; Karlan et al., 2016; Meager, 2019) . liquidity dry up, consequences can be much more severe in a much shorter time frame and with devastating effects for both sides of a market. That is a different rationale for prudential regulation of microfinance and its role in the economy of lower-income households and microenterprises. While microfinance institutions are quite diverse, there may be some common need for regulation and supervision due to the similar roles the institutions play in the financial lives of their customers, and the overlap in the customer base. Specifically, the surveys point to significant near-term and, absent action to provide future access to financial services including borrowing, long-term suffering of most microfinance customers. That is a powerful argument for regulators and central bank authorities to quickly expand their efforts at stabilizing the financial sector to include all forms of microfinance.",

While such regulation would not have prevented the current crisis, the depth and seriousness of the crisis requires it sooner rather than later to protect customers from even more harm. 44 The MFI CEOs we surveyed shared concerns about the behaviour of field staff; loan officers and customer reports showed they were right to be concerned. When a product plays such a large role in poor households' financial lives, it behooves governments to ensure that those households are protected from exploitation by the providers of that product. (Cull et al., 2011 )more regulation means higher costs, which means that the most marginalized and poorest (read, most expensive to serve) will likely find that they are no longer part of the target market of many institutions (which may in turn struggle to find funding if they can't make the case they are serving the most excluded). Along with the rhetoric about microcredit financing investment, the rhetoric that there are 'no tradeoffs' in investing in microfinance, and that the model is self-sustaining and subsidy is not needed, will likely need to be jettisoned (Cull et al., 2017) . To name just one part of the global funding mechanism, loan guarantees to microfinance institutions have been marketed to social investors and philanthropists as risk-free uses of their capital (O'Neil, 2015) . Clearly MFIs and microfinance investment vehicles are going to have to update their appeals and expected risk-adjusted returns.",

The current crisis illustrates just how far there is to go before digital financial services change operating procedures in the industry (with obvious heterogeneity from country to country). Deploying technological solutions is capital intensiveboth in terms of financial and of human capital. That's why the leaders in digital financial services tend to be either well-funded existing corporations with a steady revenue stream (like mobile network operators) or fintechs with access to large amounts of risk capital (see Tala and Branch, two prominent digital lenders, as examples). The hope had been that MFIs could 'ride the rails' of digital financial infrastructure without having to invest substantially themselves. The current crisis illustrates that this has not happened.

In the aftermath of the pandemic, this trend could accelerate. MFIs' capital, again both financial and human, is likely to be very constrained and will need to be devoted to lending operations to restore positive cash flow before MFIs can begin to invest in a digital transition.

Regardless, as survey participants noted, it is unclear whether borrowers will ever be able to fully repay these loans, especially absent new lending. What does consumer protection and responsible lending look like in the aftermath of a pandemic? Letting individual MFIs decide for themselves may not produce optimal outcomes for the lenders or for the44  The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan regulates microfinance institutions with an eye to consumer protection and ensuring that customers have a form of redress. The challenge is to extend such regulation to more countries and to ensure that regulations are adequately enforced.borrowers (see point six below for more discussion of this issue).Fourth, the global microfinance business model may need to be significantly rethoughtand additional innovation may be needed. While it's clear that MFIs are facing a liquidity crunch, and absent bailouts may quickly face insolvency, it is unclear what happens next. Even if bailouts are forthcoming, capital markets may be much more wary of investing in MFIs now that there is experience of how quickly normal operating procedure can turn into insolvency. Given that there is considerable uncertainty as to how the pandemic will play out, including possible recurrences of COVID-19, or of other epidemics or pandemics (there have now been three novel coronavirus epidemics in 17 years), there should also be uncertainty that the way microfinance has been funded for the last 40 years will remain viable. On the customer side, additional regulation and supervision imposes costs. There is a clear trade-off between the amount of regulation and who gets served",

The was followed the next day by a circular (SC/NBFC-81/ 2020) that aimed to facilitate the process of non-banking financial institutions rescheduling the loans of their borrowers as a result of COVID-19. Specifically, the policy permits all NBFCs, including Non-bank Microfinance Companies (NBFCs), to (amongst other things):(i). Defer the repayment of the loan principal amount for one year, upon a written request from the borrower up until 30 June 2020, provided that the borrower will continue to service the interest payments (officially referred to as 'mark-up'). The NBFC is permitted to decline the request, but must provide the reason, and reply within 15 working days of the request. If they allow this, it will not affect the credit history of the borrower and will not be reported as restructuring in the Credit Information Bureau (ECIB).(ii). Those borrowers who cannot service the interest payments or repay the principal within one year can request a rescheduling within 90 days of their loans being overdue for microfiannce loans, and will be 'treated as regular and reported in the ECIB accordingly'.This was distributed to all CEOs of NBFCs, NBFCs, the Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN), and the non-bank financial institution and Modaraba Association. (i). MFBs are permitted to defer the payment of loan principal by one year for their borrowers who request it in writing by 30 June 2020; however, payments of interest (officially referred to as 'mark-up') will continue to be due. MFBs must convey their decision withing 15 days of the request, and if they refuse must provide reasons to the borrower. MFBs must submit details of deferments granted to borrowers to the SBP on a weekly basis, and the deferment will not affect the credit history of the obligor nor will it be reported in the ECIB as restructuring.",
