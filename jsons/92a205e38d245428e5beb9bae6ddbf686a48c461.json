In this study, one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays were developed to differentiate B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages. The assays were evaluated using in vitro transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R 2 = 0.99), and high specificity. Using the developed rRT-PCR assays, 169 clinical specimens collected between 2010 and 2013 were then tested, resulting in the identification of 20 clinical specimens as positive for influenza B virus. Of these, 14 and 6 samples were identified as positive for the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, respectively, whereas 149 samples were negative for the influenza B virus. The rRT-PCR assays were also examined using 20 clinical isolates from 20 influenza B virus-positive specimens, revealing that there was no discrepancy between the results from the rRT-PCR assays and the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, with the exception that one clinical isolate with different antigenicity could not be discriminated by the HI test.

No discrepancy was found between the results from the duplex rRT-PCR assay and the B/Vic and B/Yam rRT-PCR assays for 20 clinical specimens and 20 clinical isolates (Table 3 and Fig. 2) . It is noteworthy that the duplex assay could be performed using clinical isolates without an RNA purification step, since a sufficient amount of viral RNA may be released from the virion under the RT conditions (50 \u2022 C, 20 min). When considering the handling of a large number of clinical isolates, this assay can be performed rapidly and simply with a lower risk of cross-contamination because an RNA purification step is unnecessary.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 341, "end": 349, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 354, "end": 361, "text": "Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the highly sensitive and specific B/NS, B/Vic, and B/Yam rRT-PCR assays developed in this study will be very useful not only for laboratory diagnostic tests but also for speeding up surveillance by discriminating the lineages of influenza B viruses in clinical specimens.
