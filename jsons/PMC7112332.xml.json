In addition to this, humans pass genetic information onto their offspring and, with it, any genetic mutations or polymorphisms. It is believed that at least 1 in 10 people have, or will eventually develop, a disease caused by mutation or variation at the gene level. Understanding how genetic mutations increase risk for human disease is critical in our understanding and treatment of the majority of human ailments that are caused by interactions between the organism and the environment.",

Proteins, including membrane\u2010bound receptors, secreted enzymes, and antibodies, begin their journey by entering the early secretory pathway at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the first stage of quality control along the secretory pathway. Proteins destined for secretion (e.g., hormones), the plasma membrane (e.g., membrane\u2010bound receptors), or other intracellular membrane compartments such as the lysosome (e.g., lysosomal proteases) are cotranslationally inserted into the ER lumen through a protein complex referred to as the Sec61 translocon (Swanton and Bulleid, 2003). Here they are folded, glycosylated, and, in some cases, assembled into oligomeric complexes before passage along the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus. Proteins in transit through the Golgi apparatus can be subject to the action of proteases and glycosylating enzymes, resulting in modifications characteristic of passage through a specific subcompartment. Secreted proteins and lipids are finally sorted at the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN) to their final destination. The ER therefore plays a rate\u2010determining role as the first compartment along this route by ensuring proteins are assembled and folded correctly before ER export. The ER thus contains a variety of resident enzymes, lectins, and chaperones that perform the quality control steps involved in protein assembly and export. A protein that does not pass this initial quality assessment, perhaps because of a mutation that does not allow correct folding or oligomerization, will be retained within the ER and subsequently degraded (Section III.A.2). In severe cases, where the ER cannot remove such a misfolded protein, an ER stress response is initiated that results in apoptosis, or cell suicide, in an attempt to preserve the functionality of the tissue or organ (Kaufman, 1999).",

These changes lead to a net increase in water absorption and a characteristic thickening of lung mucus in CF patients. Whereas both wild\u2010type CFTR and CFTR\u0394F508 interact with ER chaperones, mutant CFTR shows prolonged interaction with ER chaperones Hsp70/Hdj\u20101 and calnexin (Amaral 2004, Pind 1994).",

Here, the mutant protein is retained within the ER, resulting in either dilation of the organelle, such as in congenital hyperthyroidism (Medeiros\u2010Neto et al., 1996) and hypofibrinogenemia (Callea et al., 1992), or chronic ER stress as is the case for hereditary emphysema (Perlmutter, 2003). In Pelizaeus\u2010Merzbacher disease, an X\u2010linked leukodystrophy disease, ER accumulation of proteolipid protein (PLP) results in oligodendrocyte apoptosis (Gow et al., 1998) and the subsequent disruption of white matter formation in the brain observed in humans and mouse models. PLP is a central nervous system protein that is the major component of myelin and, when expressed in cultured fibroblasts, is localized to the plasma membrane (Gow et al., 1994). The link between PLP and the ER stress response provides a tool for elucidating the cellular response to misfolded protein accumulation (Swanton et al., 2003).",

When a mammalian protein such as CFTR is expressed in budding yeast, it matures relatively slowly within the yeast ER, leading to retrotranslocation to the cytoplasm and degradation (Ward et al., 1995). A further example is that of \u03b11\u2010antitrypsin deficiency. \u03b11\u2010Antitrypsin is responsible for inactivating the enzyme elastase produced by lung neutrophils. In this inherited disease, a mutated form of \u03b11\u2010antitrypsin is retrotranslocated and degraded in proteasomes, leading to retention of active elastase in lung tissues and thus is a cause of lung emphysema (Rutishauser and Spiess, 2002).",

(2003) identified eight mutations in the Sar1p gene product and COPII component associated with these lipid absorption diseases, thus strongly implicating a role for the COPII vesicular transport system in the movement of dietary fats from the intestine to the circulating bloodstream.",

            "text": "COPII mediates anterograde traffic from the ER to the Golgi apparatus; however, COPI vesicles appear to function primarily in the retrograde (backward) transfer of proteins from the Golgi and ERGIC back to the ER. This retrograde traffic is necessary for recovering escaped ER resident proteins, coat and SNARE proteins that have arrived at the ERGIC and Golgi from COPII vesicles, or glycosylation enzymes that have been incorrectly modified (Duden 2003, Lee 2004). The Golgi\u2010associated COPI coatomer is a complex of seven polypeptides: \u03b1\u2010, \u03b2\u2010, \u03b2\u2032\u2010, \u03b3\u2010, \u03b4\u2010, \u03b5\u2010, and \u03b6\u2010COP gene products, which interact with the donor membrane to form COPI vesicles. Vesicle formation is triggered by the GTPase ADP\u2010ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), which recruits COPI coatomer to the donor membrane. Transmembrane proteins containing cytoplasmic lysine\u2010based motifs such as KKXX or KXKXX, or soluble proteins containing the C\u2010terminal KDEL motif, are recycled by COPI\u2010coated vesicles from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER. The KDEL motif, present in soluble ER chaperones such as BiP and protein disulfide isomerase, is recognized by the membrane\u2010bound KDEL receptor (Majoul et al., 2001). In both cases, cytoplasmic motifs in these transmembrane proteins are recognized and bound by COPI coatomer, promoting inclusion into vesicles destined for the ER. Actin microfilaments are also involved in this retrograde transport step (Valderrama et al., 2001). This Golgi\u2013ER step is regulated by the GTPase Cdc42 and N\u2010WASP protein (Luna et al., 2002), factors previously implicated in actin\u2010linked processes at the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "Controversy exists regarding the mechanism for anterograde movement of cargo proteins within the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus contains secretory proteins that can vary in physical size, from relatively small polypeptides to large, bulky multisubunit complexes; all need to reach the TGN for final sorting into transport intermediates. There are also resident glycosylation enzymes that have spatially restricted functions within the Golgi, that is, enzymes that function within specific subcompartments to ensure the correct addition or trimming of N\u2010 and O\u2010linked sugars on secreted proteins as they progress through the pathway. This raises a key question: how do protein and lipid cargo move through the Golgi apparatus while resident enzymes retain their localization? We know that many Golgi enzymes contain transmembrane Golgi localization signals that mediate targeting to a specific compartment (Munro, 1998). Two models have been proposed: the cisternal maturation model and the vesicular transport model (Elsner 2003, Storrie 2000). Briefly, the cisternal maturation model suggests that large proteins or aggregates remain within a single Golgi cisterna, which matures through the retrograde transfer of resident enzymes via COPI vesicles. In contrast, the vesicular transport model proposes that newly synthesized protein is trafficked from cisterna to cisterna via COPI\u2010coated vesicles that sequentially bud off membranes and fuse with the next subcompartment. In either case, COPI\u2010coated vesicles play a central role in intra\u2010Golgi transport. A number of SNARE proteins, such as membrin, rbet1, GS27, and syntaxin\u20105, have also been localized to the Golgi apparatus and are required for intra\u2010Golgi transport and homeostasis (Nichols and Pelham, 1998).",

The reader is pointed to an in\u2010depth review that covers golgins in more detail (Short et al., 2005). In brief, the golgins can be anchored to Golgi membranes through various mechanisms and contain characteristic coiled\u2010coil domains that extend from the membranes as a rod\u2010like structure (Burkhard et al., 2001). Golgins such as giantin and golgin\u201084 are securely anchored to the membrane via a transmembrane domain near their C terminus. Electrostatic or ionic interactions mediate the attachment of other golgins to membranes. For example, proteins of the GRASP family (GRASP65 and GRASP55) bind to GM130 and golgin\u201045 to recruit these factors to the cis and medial Golgi membranes, respectively. Moreover, a large number of golgins are recruited to membranes via interactions with the Rab, ARF, and ARL (ARF\u2010like) GTPases. Vesicular and cis\u2010Golgi membrane recruitment of golgin p115 is regulated by Rab1, whereas membrane attachment of yeast golgin Rud3p is regulated by ARF1p. Golgin\u201097 binds to membranes by interaction with ARL1p, a member of a new class of ARF\u2010like GTPases termed ARLs (Short et al., 2005). Interestingly, autoantibodies directed against giantin, golgin\u2010245, golgin\u2010160, GM130, and golgin\u201097 golgins and GRASPs are present in patients with autoimmune conditions such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.",

Mammalian p115 is crucial for maintenance of the stacked nature of the Golgi cisternae (Puthenveedu and Linstedt, 2004). During mitosis, the Golgi stack disperses into clustered vesicles. These vesicles then fuse in the daughter cells to form new cisternae, alignment and stacking of which result in the formation of a fully functional organelle. GRASP65 tethers have been proposed to hold cisternae in close proximity through interactions with p115 and GM130 (Shorter and Warren, 1999). The golgin p115 is also involved in tethering COPI vesicles to Golgi membranes (Sonnichsen et al., 1998) and may be needed for SNARE complex assembly (Shorter et al., 2002).

At steady state, ATP7A (Menkes disease copper transporter; Section III.A.1) resides in the TGN, where it provides newly synthesized cuproenzymes such as lysyl oxidase with copper ions as they traverse the secretory pathway. When intracellular copper ion levels rise, ATP7A responds to this environmental danger by redistributing to the plasma membrane in a Cdc42\u2010regulated manner (Cobbold et al., 2002). Here, ATP7A acts as a copper efflux pump to remove copper ions from the cytoplasm to maintain homeostatic function and prevent toxicity. When copper levels are reduced, ATP7A recycles back to the TGN. This endocytic internalization and sorting event is independent of both clathrin and caveolae (Cobbold et al., 2003), although relying on a cytoplasmic dileucine motif present in the ATP7A C\u2013terminus (Francis 1999, Petris 1999).",

Members of a class of clathrin\u2010associated factor termed adaptor protein (AP) complexes are recruited to donor membranes through interactions with a docking complex, which then further interacts with motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of cargo proteins, resulting in \u201ccargo capture.\u201d This leads to clathrin cage assembly and the concomitant polymerization of the clathrin triskelion and resultant deformation of the donor membrane. Scission, or vesicle release from the plasma membrane, is believed to occur through the action of the GTPase dynamin and other accessory proteins, such as amphiphysin (Wigge et al., 1997). In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a dynamin gene mutation (shibire) causes temperature\u2010sensitive paralysis. This is likely due to a block in the endocytic uptake of synaptic vesicle proteins at the plasma membrane, leading to a block in recycling and reformation of competent synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals (Chen 1991, Koenig 1989, Kosaka 1983, van der Bliek 1991). The expression of a dominant\u2010negative GDP\u2010bound dynamin mutant, K44A, results in compromised CCV formation (Herskovits 1993, van der Bliek 1993) and inhibition of clathrin\u2010mediated internalization of the glucose transporter GLUT4 (Al\u2010Hasani et al., 1998), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Daecke et al., 2005), and influenza virus (Roy et al., 2000). The scission function of dynamin is assisted by specific lipid\u2010modifying enzymes such as endophilin, synaptojanin, and phospholipase D (Bi 1997, Haffner 1997, Ringstad 1999, Schmidt 1999, Woscholski 1997). Finally, CCV uncoating at the target membrane occurs through the actions of the heat shock protein Hsc70 (Schlossman et al., 1984) and auxilin (Ungewickell et al., 1995).",

Four adaptor protein complexes (AP1\u2013AP4), each comprising four different subunits, have been identified (Robinson, 2004). The AP1 complex is involved in clathrin\u2010coated vesicle formation at the TGN for transport to late endosomes; evidence has also implicated a role for this complex in a TGN\u2010to\u2010plasma membrane step (Folsch et al., 2003). AP2 is the best\u2010studied of the four complexes and mediates internalization of transmembrane receptors at the plasma membrane via clathrin\u2010coated vesicles. The AP3 complex is involved in trafficking from early endosomes to either late endosomes or lysosome\u2010related organelles such as melanosomes, platelet\u2010dense bodies, and antigen\u2010processing compartments. Finally, the AP4 complex was the last to be cloned (Hirst 1999, Dell'Angelica 1999a). In contrast to AP1\u2013AP3, AP4 does not possess the \u03b2 \u201cear\u201d domain (see below), which allows interaction with clathrin and other cytosolic factors such as Eps15 and auxilin 2 (Lundmark and Carlsson, 2002). By electron microscopy, AP4 has been localized to vesicles at the TGN, plasma membrane, and early endosomes, although there is debate as to whether these vesicles are clathrin\u2010coated (Hirst 1999, Barois 2005). Interestingly, AP3 and AP4 may function independently of clathrin (Hirst 1999, Vowels 1998), suggesting the existence of another, as yet unidentified, coat protein that is analogous to clathrin.",

Such motifs include NPXY, YXX\u00d8, and dileucine\u2010based sequences (\u00d8 represents a bulky hydrophobic amino acid). One such motif, NPXY, is present in key cellular receptors such as low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or Erb1), and insulin receptor, and mediates endocytosis and sorting. Importantly, the JD mutation (Y807C) in LDLR lies within this key motif and causes familial hypercholesterolemia (Knoblauch et al., 2000). The second tyrosine\u2010based motif, YXX\u00d8, mediates plasma membrane internalization, lysosomal targeting, and basolateral targeting of cargo. This motif is found in lysosomal residents such as LAMP\u20101 and \u20102, CD63, the recycling transferrin receptor (TfR), and TGN\u2010associated recycling membrane proteins, furin and TGN38. Di\u2010leucine motifs present on transmembrane transporters such as GLUT4 (glucose transporter), ATP7A, and mannose\u20106\u2010phosphate receptors (M6PR) can fall into two categories: [DE]XXX[LI] and DXXLL related motifs.

            "text": "The disease oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) is an X\u2010linked disorder caused by mutations in the OCRL1 gene (Lowe, 2005). The gene product is an inositol 5\u2032\u2010phosphatase that catalyzes the removal of the phosphate from this position on the inositol moiety. The preferred OCRL1 substrate is PI(4,5)P2, a phosphoinositide shown to be important in endocytosis because of its central role in recruiting accessory proteins to CCVs (Padron et al., 2003). OCRL1 has been localized to clathrin\u2010coated vesicles associated with endosomal and TGN membranes (Choudhury et al., 2005). This is not surprising as OCRL1 interacts with clathrin and promotes its assembly into clathrin lattices and cages (Choudhury 2005, Ungewickell 2004). OCRL1 also interacts with the Rac1 GTPase that regulates actin dynamics, possibly via a GTPase activation domain to accelerate GTP hydrolysis (Faucherre et al., 2003). Although the exact function of OCRL1 is still unclear, the disease phenotype hints to OCRL1 function in membrane trafficking. OCRL1 mutations can cause loss of protein expression and phosphatase activity. RNAi\u2010mediated inhibition of OCRL1 expression in cultured human cells results in partial redistribution of a cation\u2010independent mannose\u20106\u2010phosphate receptor and a TGN recycling protein (TGN46) to early endosomes (Choudhury et al., 2005). This suggests that loss of OCRL1 perturbs endosome\u2010to\u2010TGN vesicle transport, suggesting a functional requirement for this membrane traffic step. It is possible that OCRL1 plays a role in anterograde trafficking from the TGN\u2010to\u2010endosomes as well, since OCRL1 is abundantly present on TGN\u2010associated clathrin buds destined for the endocytic pathway.",

The caveolin\u20101 and caveolin\u20102 genes are located on human 7q31.1 near the microsatellite repeat marker D7S522. This region is commonly deleted in various cancers (Engelman et al., 1998), hinting that caveolin gene deletion may be advantageous for tumor progression. In one report, the caveolin\u20101 P132L mutation was present in 16% of breast cancer patients studied (Hayashi et al., 2001). The P132L mutation was also linked to the metastatic potential of tumors and disease prognosis. The caveolin\u20101 P132L mutation also conferred increased cell migration and altered morphology. Caveolin\u20101 protein levels can be reduced or absent from a number of human breast cancer cell lines compared with normal mammary cells (Lee et al., 1998). Similarly, silent and missense mutations in caveolin\u20101 have also been associated with oral carcinomas (Han et al., 2004). Caveolin\u20101, and to a lesser extent caveolin\u20102, gene expression is downregulated in some cases of thyroid carcinoma (Aldred et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Although it remains unclear as to why the loss of caveolin causes cell proliferation diseases such as cancer, one can speculate on the role of caveolin in regulating signaling pathways. In endothelial cells, which have a high abundance of caveolin, the key vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) has been shown to be inactive when localized to caveolae (Labrecque et al., 2003). This receptor tyrosine kinase modulates the endothelial response to the key VEGF\u2010A cytokine and controls angiogenesis and new blood vessel formation, thus regulating neovascularization and tumor growth (Neufeld et al., 1999). Similarly, platelet\u2010derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase activity is reduced when associated with caveolae (Yamamoto et al., 1999). In addition to VEGFR2 and PDGFR, a number of G protein\u2010coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to interact with caveola\u2010associated factors (Insel et al., 2005). GPCRs are a large family of transmembrane receptors involved in a variety of signal transduction events. These receptors are activated by a range of ligands, including hormones and peptides, and have been linked to a number of cancers such as thyroid, lung, and gastric. The presence of a number of GPCRs in caveolae suggests that these plasma membrane structures may interact with GPCRs and modulate their signaling potential. Lisanti and others (Li et al., 1995a) have shown that caveolin\u20101 interacts solely with inactive forms of G\u2010protein \u03b1 subunits, lending credence to the negative regulation hypothesis caused by the association of caveolae with transmembrane signaling receptors.",

Fc\u2010mediated binding can trigger a complex signaling response involving extrusion of fine plasma membrane projections (pseudopodia) from the macrophage to surround and engulf the pathogen, forming a phagosome. The signaling response is reviewed in greater detail elsewhere (Bokoch 2005, Chimini 2000, Niedergang 2005). In brief, the activation of tyrosine kinases and Rho GTPases is triggered through FcR signaling. The Rac and Cdc42 GTPases, in conjunction with the downstream effector WASP, mediate remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to pseudopodium formation and phagosome closure (Castellano 2001, Chimini 2000). In contrast, the complement mediated\u2010uptake of opsonized particles differs such that they appear to \u201cfall\u201d into the cell in a process that requires Rho, but not Rac or Cdc42 (Bokoch, 2005).",

Mycobacterium can evade host degradation by secreting a soluble serine/threonine protein kinase G molecule into the phagosome.

One key endosomal regulator is the ubiquitously expressed Rab5a GTPase. Rab5a is present on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane, vesicles, and tubular endosomal profiles (Chavrier et al., 1990). A number of Rab5a\u2010associated effector proteins regulate endosomal fusion and mediate protein cargo movement and endosomal sorting (Zerial and McBride, 2001). Such effector proteins, including Rabaptin\u20105, Rabex\u20105, and Rabenosyn\u20105, are clustered on the cytosolic face of the early endosome and stabilize the GTP\u2010bound Rab5a in an activated state (Horiuchi et al., 1997). GTP\u2010bound Rab5a directly binds to early endosome antigen EEA1 to regulate vesicular and endosomal tethering. EEA1 contains a C\u2010terminal Rab5a\u2010binding domain, and a phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010phosphate\u2010binding zinc finger domain referred to as an FYVE (conserved in Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1) domain (Gaullier 1998, Stenmark 1996). Overexpression of wild\u2010type Rab5a, or a constitutively active Rab5a mutant, causes endosome enlargement and defective trafficking through this compartment, whereas expression of a constitutively inactive Rab5a mutant leads to formation of small endosomes and decreased endocytosis (Bucci et al., 1992). A family of effector proteins that accelerate GTPase hydrolysis (RabGAPs) have been identified: RabGAP\u20105 binds to Rab5a and regulates trafficking through the endocytic pathway (Haas et al., 2005).",

Interestingly, the TSC2 gene product (tuberin) is implicated in regulating GTP/GDP exchange on Rab5a, thus regulating trafficking through this endosome system (Xiao et al., 1997). In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) a genetic translocation causes fusion of Rab5a effector Rabaptin\u20105 and the PDGF\u03b2R (Magnusson et al., 2001). This chromosomal translocation results in enhanced cellular proliferation by compromising endosomal fusion and trafficking, and thus regulation of growth factor degradation.

Late endosome and lysosome interactions in the kiss\u2010and\u2010run model are thought to be regulated by the Rab7 GTPase, which is present on late endosomes; a Vps complex, homologous to budding yeast vacuole fusion regulators, is also implicated in sorting and delivery to lysosomes (Seals et al., 2000). The mammalian form of the Vps complex interacts with syntaxin\u20107, a t\u2010SNARE that is concerned in regulating membrane dynamics along this route (Kim et al., 2001).",

Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, leading to degradation for provision of molecules for cellular homeostasis.

It is classified into five types (A\u2013E), each distinguished by either clinical severity or age\u2010related disease phenotype. Niemann\u2010Pick type A (NPA) is most common, with death occurring before 3 years of age. NPA patients have point mutations in the SMPD1 gene that encodes a lysosomal sphingomyelinase (Levran 1991, Takahashi 1992). Interestingly, in NPC patients, endocytosed LDL particles are not fully degraded in lysosomes, leading to defects in cholesterol metabolism (Li et al., 2005a). The NPC disease is caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene, which encodes a lysosomal resident protein with similarity to sterol\u2010sensing enzymes and proteins (Scott and Ioannou, 2004).",

In the rare, fatal disease familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) SLs congregate at the plasma membrane in CTLs, where they can dock but cannot fuse with the membrane. In one group of FHL patients, this disease is due to a mutation in the gene encoding Munc13\u20104; this is closely related to the neuronal Munc13\u20101 gene product that is involved in SNARE complex formation in neuronal cells (Feldmann et al., 2003). Assembly of this neuronal syntaxin\u20101, SNAP\u201025, and synaptobrevin complex is regulated by Munc18\u20101, which binds and locks syntaxin\u20101 (t\u2010SNARE) in a closed, inactive conformation, thus preventing it from interacting with SNAP\u201025 (Yang et al., 2000). However, Munc13\u20101 (Sassa et al., 1999) and RIM (Rab3a\u2010interacting protein effector) (Koushika et al., 2001) can compete with Munc18\u20101 and displace it from syntaxin\u20101. This reinforces the syntaxin\u20101 open conformation and allows SNARE complex formation to occur. Munc13\u20101 may act as a conformational switch to promote t\u2010SNARE into an \u201copen\u201d state, thus allowing formation of the SNARE complex that mediates synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. From observations of FHL patients, one speculation is that Munc13\u20104 has a role similar to that of Munc13\u20101 in regulating SNARE complex formation for SL docking and fusion in CTLs (Yang et al., 2000).",

In melanocytes, cells responsible for pigment storage and production, Rab27a is required to recruit melanophilin to pigment granules called melanosomes (SLs). Melanophilin binds the myosin motor protein myosin Va and regulates melanosome movement along actin cables to the plasma membrane (Hume 2002, Strom 2002, Wu 2002). In type 1 Griscelli syndrome patients, Rab27a GTPase is missing or defective, whereas in type 2 Griscelli syndrome patients the myosin Va motor protein is absent. These defects are also evident in mouse models such as ashen (Rab27a defective), dilate (myosin Va defective), and leaden (melanophilin defective). In both the human Griscelli syndromes and the mouse models, melanosomes are clustered in a perinuclear location, a defect attributed to Rab27a dysfunction (Wilson 2000, Wu 2001). Interestingly, CTLs isolated from type 1 Griscelli syndrome patients and ashen mice (Rab27a deficient) are unable to kill target cells, whereas type 2 Griscelli syndrome patient and dilate mouse CTLs are functional. This suggests that Rab27a interacts with different effectors to induce SL fusion with the plasma membrane in different cell types (Haddad et al., 2001).",

However, HPS cannot be viewed as a single disease but a group of at least seven autosomal genetic disorders. Each of the seven subgroups (HPS1\u20137) is due to mutations in individual genes, most of which encode components of multisubunit protein complexes involved in vesicle trafficking (Li et al., 2003), whereas the function of others remains unclear. Three of these complexes, termed BLOCs (biogenesis of lysosome\u2010related organelle complexes), play a role in regulating trafficking involved in platelet and melanosome secretion, but their exact functions are unclear (Di Pietro and Dell'Angelica, 2005). In HPS2 patients a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the \u03b23A subunit of the AP3 adaptor protein prevents expression of this subunit (Huizing et al., 2002). As previously mentioned, AP3 is involved in the recruitment of transmembrane proteins into vesicles at the early endosome for delivery to the lysosome (Peden et al., 2004). In melanocytes derived from HPS2 patients, the tyrosinase that catalyzes the formation of melanin is not transported to maturing melanosomes (Huizing et al., 2001). This leads to the characteristic pattern of albinism seen in patients with this condition.",

The LIS1 protein regulates microtubule motor function by binding dynein1 and p150Glued, a component of the dynactin complex that binds to and activates dynein (Smith et al., 2000). It is proposed that LIS1 regulates retrograde axonal transport.

In Alzheimer's disease, a classical sign is hyperphosphorylated aggregates of the microtubule\u2010associated protein, tau, in neuronal cells and tissues. Tau protein can influence vesicular transport (Ebneth et al., 1998) by regulating the attachment of motors to microtubules (Trinczek et al., 1999). One theory is that the tau protein can interfere with kinesin\u2010dependent transport by blocking motor access to microtubules, thus slowing or preventing vesicle movement along axons (Mandelkow et al., 2003). Moreover, an early sign of Alzheimer's disease is the loss of synapses and retrograde degeneration of neurons, complemented by a breakdown in intracellular transport.",

It has been demonstrated that Htt enhances vesicular transport of brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) along microtubules (Gauthier et al., 2004). Htt is localized in the cytoplasm and is associated with vesicular and microtubule\u2010based traffic through its ability to bind Huntingtin\u2010associated protein 1 (HAP1) (Li et al., 1995b), a protein that has affinity for the dynactin p150Glued subunit (Engelender et al., 1997). Dysfunctional polyQ\u2010Htt associated with the disease state may disrupt the transport of BDNF by binding and blocking the HAP1/dynactin\u2010mediated delivery of BDNF vesicles along microtubules (Gauthier et al., 2004). This is further supported by the finding that BDNF levels are decreased in brains of Huntington's disease patients (Ferrer et al., 2000).",

These are often lipid\u2010based reagents (e.g., liposomes) that bind to the plasmid DNA and fuse with the plasma membrane, thus enabling cytosolic delivery of the gene. The plasmid DNA would then be transported into the host nucleus by endogenous cellular machinery. This type of gene delivery can only be performed ex vivo and can be limited by the poor DNA transfection efficiency of primary cells or tissues. This type of method, however, is a potentially useful method for delivering genes into progenitors or precursors (e.g., stem cells) before cellular differentiation and tissue formation within a particular microenvironment in the body (Mendell et al., 1995).",

Chemical chaperones such as glycerol and trimethylamine N\u2010oxide (TMAO) can restore the wild\u2010type trafficking and activity of CFTR\u0394F508 in cultured epithelial cells (Brown et al., 1996), and porcine kidney epithelial cells expressing CFTR\u0394F508 and treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) increased plasma membrane levels of the channel protein (Bebok et al., 1998).

Plant\u2010 and microorganism\u2010derived polyhydroxylated alkaloids referred to as iminosugars have been used in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease (Cox et al., 2000). Gaucher disease type I and type II is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the acid \u03b2\u2010glucosidase (GBA) enzyme and results in the accumulation of toxic glucosylceramide in a patient's spleen, liver, and bones; manifesting itself in enlargement of these organs, as well as heart and lung disease. Iminosugars act on glycosylating enzymes present within the ER and Golgi and inhibit their ability to transfer sugar moieties onto proteins. One member of the iminosugar family, N\u2010butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB\u2010DNJ; also called miglustat or Zavesca) inhibits the enzyme important in the maturation of the GBA substrate glucocerebroside, namely ceramide glucosyltransferase (CGT) (Butters et al., 2003). Inhibition of CGT has resulted in significantly reduced levels of glucocerebroside in the liver and spleen of patient in clinical trials (Cox et al., 2000). However, nearly 80% of patients in the trials displayed osmotic diarrhea as a side effect of the treatment. In a mouse model for human Tay\u2010Sachs disease, which is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding hexosamidase A, levels of the harmful glycophospholipid GM2 were significantly reduced on treatment with NB\u2010DNJ (Platt et al., 1997). In addition to the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases, an NB\u2010DNJ derivative called miglitol has been used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, resulting in reduced activity of the sucrose\u2013isomaltase enzyme complex and reduction of carbohydrate digestion (Mitrakou et al., 1998).",

Cellular proliferation can be regulated by growth factor binding to a cell surface receptor and signaling through either the mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphoinositide\u20103\u2010kinase (PI3K) cascades. Activation of these pathways induces the expression of oncogenes such as c\u2010jun and c\u2010fos and inhibits apoptosis through a sequence of protein phosphorylation events. Shelton et al. (2003) demonstrated that inhibition of the MAPK pathway with small molecule inhibitors specific for Raf\u20101 or MEK reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in conditionally transformed hematopoietic cells. However, such pathways also regulate other cellular functions besides proliferation or apoptosis and there are likely to be consequences for cellular homeostasis.",

The enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps in \u03b2\u2010amyloid synthesis, \u03b3\u2010secretase, is an attractive target for prevention of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease patients (Churcher and Beher, 2005). Such small molecule inhibitors could also be used to treat pathogenic infections such as those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, HIV, or hepatitis C viruses. Attractive targets are virus\u2010encoded or host proteases required for processing of viral proteins to generate infectious virus particles from the host cell. In the case of the SARS virus, a viral chymotrypsin\u2010like cysteine protease is responsible for processing SARS viral proteins required for viral replication. Inhibition of this protease would effectively inhibit viral replication. A molecule referred to as CS11 was found to inhibit the replication of human SARS with no toxic effect on normal cells (Dooley et al., 2006). Much work is also being carried out in targeting host proteases required for the processing of HIV envelope glycoproteins by the biosynthetic secretory pathway to generate viral gp120 and gp41 polypeptides.",

As noted in this review, a number of examples exist in which a single gene mutation can have devastating effects on human function. At present, the symptoms of some mild forms of genetic diseases can be modulated through diet or drug regimens, and some success has been achieved with organ transplantation. Gene therapy has attracted much attention but has suffered setbacks due to viral toxicity issues. An alternative strategy is the use of small molecule therapeutics, which may override specific defects or target specific pathways to compensate for gene defect(s). In addition, our understanding of how we respond at a genetic level to pathological infection will enable us to design effective drug strategies to presently chronic infections. In essence, understanding the cell biological basis for human diseases will enable us to design effective methods to deliver therapeutic strategies to patients.",

Proteins destined for the secretory pathway (this example shows a transmembrane protein) are cotranslationally translocated from the ribosome into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a portal referred to as the Sec61 translocon. As the newly synthesized protein enters the ER, quality control mechanisms in the form of protein chaperones bind to it and fold it to its correct conformation. Further processing occurs through interactions with other chaperones before the successfully folded protein is loaded into COPII\u2010coated vesicles and shuttled from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. However, if the protein carries a mutation that causes it to take on an aberrant conformation the ER chaperones will trigger a misfolded protein response. This has two outcomes: either the chaperones will remain bound to the misfolded protein, preventing its escape from the organelle (ER retention), or the protein will be ubiquitinated and retrotranslocated through the Sec61 complex for proteasomal degradation in the cell cytoplasm. A number of human genetic diseases are a result of key proteins failing to traffic through the secretory pathway and as a consequence are retained or degraded in this manner.",

Cargo protein (C) continues along the secretory pathway through the Golgi apparatus to the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN). Retention signals in ER resident proteins (R) ensure they undergo retrograde trafficking from the Golgi in COPI vesicles. Retrograde transport of Golgi enzymes that may have escaped their resident cisternae also occurs in COPI\u2010coated vesicles. At the distal face of the Golgi the TGN ensures the correct targeting of proteins, either constitutively or regulated to the plasma membrane, or to intracellular membrane compartments such as proteolytic or secretory lysosomes.",
