After the burn center was emptied and sterilized, all bus attack patients were shifted to the burn ward. The SAHZU burn center did not admit any new burn patients until the earlier bus attack patients were stabilized or discharged; the other two area hospitals would handle this function (Fig. 4a).(2)As the care, wound dressing, and surgery of patients with severe burns is both time consuming and labor intensive, doctors and nurses trained in our burn center (including those from other hospitals) were called in for reinforcement in shifts.(3)Multidisciplinary care was provided for critically injured patients. Several specialized teams were intimately involved: life/vital organ support, ICU physicians and nurses; inhalation injury management, respiratory therapists and bronchoscope operators (Fig. 4b); venous pathway maintenance, an intravenous (IV) team consisting of a specialized catheter anesthesiologist and nurse (Fig. 4c); and infection control, a hospital infection control/surveillance specialist and antibiotic experts. Moreover, a multidisciplinary conference attended by these experts, department directors, and hospital leaders was held at 16:00 every day for team members to discuss and solve problems of the most critically injured patients (Fig. 4d).(4)Logistic and material support was organized to ensure adequate supplies for intensive care. Both the hospital and government supported the clinical enterprise by acquiring the required drugs, equipment, instruments, plasma, and other blood products. Two operation rooms were exclusively assigned to the burn center, allowing us to conduct operations when needed.\n",

In 2006, the International Society for Burn Injuries (ISBI) published guidelines for managing disasters involving large numbers of patients with severe burns [11]. The guidelines include a set of fundamental concepts for reference provided by medical personnel and government officials involved in disaster planning and management. It describes in detail the facilities, specialized burn teams, equipment, and facility\u2013society communication needed to prepare for massive burn disasters.",

These teams are usually composed of burn surgeons, nurses, respiratory therapists, anesthesiologists, and intensive care specialists [13]. In the present case, SAHZU also established such an interdisciplinary team to conduct burn-centered intensive therapy. Later in 2014, SAHZU sent this team to Kunshan to help local hospitals treat the 150 severely injured victims of an accidental factory explosion.",

The victims were completely engulfed in fire and smoke. Although the bus capacity limited the number of victims, their average total burn area, degree of inhalation injury, and proportion of severe burn were significantly greater than those seen in similar disasters, for example, the 2003 Rhode Island nightclub fire, the 1998 discotheque fire in Gothenburg, and the 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire [8], [14], [15].3.Bus attacks are more likely to occur in crowded downtown areas, where spontaneous rescue attempts by untrained civilians may dramatically decrease the on-scene mortality. Lastly, almost half of the victims were retired tourists much older than the victims of the nightclub fires. Their preexisting chronic comorbidities may have been aggravated by the injury, stress, and hypoxia of the fire, which may have interfered with the treatment.\n",

In the treatment stage, this mechanism also supplied us with adequate blood products, special drugs, and the needed equipment.3.The burn-centered multidisciplinary teams and daily/interim consult conferences to treat the most critically injured patients were successful components of our disaster response. The highly efficient cooperation of these specialized teams allowed the burn surgeon to conduct 53 excision-and-graft operations within the first month, thus significantly reducing the incidence of wound-related infections. Five critical situations were successfully addressed with the consult conferences, with no in-hospital mortality.\n",

Therefore, to prevent massive casualties in such burn disasters, it is important to mobilize civilians to report and stop suspicious persons before the attack, as well as to train drivers and passengers to extinguish the fire and evacuate the victims.2.The golden period of emergency treatment for thermal injury is critical for successful resuscitation of mass burn casualties. However, public education has failed to inform civilians to triage the burn patient to the hospital with the largest and most advanced burn unit. Ten patients \u2013 more than half \u2013 were driven to the nearest hospitals without a burn ward, delaying treatment and subsequently requiring secondary triage. Therefore, the public should be educated on their responses to such circumstances.3.We took 2 days to arrange the transfer of the original burn patients to a central hospital and to sterilize the burn ward for concentrated treatment of the bus attack victims. The ICU physicians were unfamiliar with postburn fluid resuscitation therapy, which may have contributed to the early renal failure of one patient with severe burns, who subsequently survived. The experience of this bus fire attack could help us address these shortcomings.\n",
