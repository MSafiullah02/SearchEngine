While previously a death sentence, combination therapy transformed HIV infection into a largely manageable, chronic condition, leading to the majority of people with HIV being over age 50 [1]. We have little understanding of the physical and psychosocial needs of this first cohort to age with HIV. Challenges associated with aging with HIV are compounded by discrimination due to race, gender, and sexual orientation. Many people aging with HIV have also endured significant trauma due to AIDS, including personal losses of friends and loved ones, contributing to high rates of depression [2].",

Older adults living with HIV are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 complications due several factors including accentuated aging, being immunocompromised, and having higher rates of serious co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases [3, 4]. People with complicating health factors are cautioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take extra precautions to avoid COVID-19. So while physical distancing is a necessary strategy to flatten the curve, ease pressure on the healthcare system, and protect the most vulnerable, the order further increases the isolation faced by people aging with HIV, and creates barriers to accessing medications, health services, and other resources. For many long-term HIV survivors, the current COVID-19 pandemic parallels the early days of AIDS in many ways, with mirrored delays in acknowledging and responding to the pandemic and lack of testing and treatment.",

We obtained a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) engagement award, which was meant to build local capacity to conduct research through community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches. Located in Palm Springs, California (a popular retirement community in the Coachella Valley with the highest proportion of people aging with HIV in the United States), we have been working over the past five years to prepare stakeholders to conduct innovative and local research. As part of this, we formed a steering committee led by research and community member co-leaders, and including older adults living with HIV, non-medical caregivers of older adults with HIV, community-based organizations that serve people living with HIV, researchers, and healthcare providers. The steering committee meets on a monthly basis, with a core team meeting weekly to be able to rapidly respond to emerging health concerns and priorities. As the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, and the committee shifted to remote meetings, the urgency of the pandemic and understanding the unmet needs of the community aging with HIV became apparent. Since the committee is responsive to current needs, they shifted their efforts to COVID-19 with the idea to conduct a needs and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) assessment survey of older adults living with HIV in the Coachella Valley. All stakeholders played a role in developing question topics and helped guide the creation of the survey to be most beneficial to people aging with HIV.",

We utilized tools from the National Institutes of Health Disaster Research Response database (www.dr2.nlm.nih.gov), and instruments from researchers engaged in the field of HIV and aging. The initial survey was presented virtually at a steering committee meeting, and extensive feedback was received from community members and other stakeholders. Once we reached consensus on questions, we then piloted the survey with 10 participants to identify steps in the outreach protocol or instruments that needed refinement. In the implementation phase of the study, we reached out to local service-based groups in the Coachella Valley known to assist older adults living with HIV and distributed recruitment emails to their members through their mailing lists. We were able to move from idea germination to survey implementation in less than three weeks.",

In terms of substance use behaviors, 20.0% reported increases in alcohol use, 14.3% reported increases in marijuana use, and 5.7% reported increases in other substance use during the pandemic. One-third experienced financial challenges because of COVID-19, 20.0% experienced difficulty paying for basic needs like food, electricity, and rent, and 34.3% state that they or someone in their household have requested unemployment benefits.

The speed at which we were able to respond was due to several factors: (1) our team\u2019s existing networks of experts in HIV and aging, (2) an established steering committee with members who are familiar with reviewing and providing feedback about research, (3) relationships that have cultivated trust between academics and community members over time, and (4) a responsive institutional review board.",
