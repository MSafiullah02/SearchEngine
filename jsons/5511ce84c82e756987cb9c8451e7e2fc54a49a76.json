            "text": "There are currently no therapeutic options for mitigating this disease due to lack of a vaccine and limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology. As a result, there is an urgent need to create new disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 biology and to screen for therapeutics using human disease-relevant tissues. COVID-19 patients typically present with respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, but nearly 25% of patients have gastrointestinal indications including anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, these symptoms are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes 1 . Here, we report using human pluripotent stem cell-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the permissiveness of colonic cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining showed that the putative viral entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple hESC-derived colonic cell types, but highly enriched in enterocytes. Multiple cell types in the COs can be infected by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, which was further validated in vivo using a humanized mouse model. We used hPSC-derived COs in a high throughput platform to screen 1280 FDA-approved drugs against viral infection. Mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride were found to block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoentry virus in COs both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed to block infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study established both in vitro and in vivo organoid models to investigate infection of SARS-CoV-2 disease-relevant human colonic cell types and identified drugs that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection, suitable for rapid clinical testing.",

In brief, hPSC-COs were cultured in 384-well plates. After overnight incubation, organoids were treated with drugs from the library at 10 \u03bc M. One hour post-exposure with drugs, the organoids were innoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus. 24 hpi, the organoids were analyzed for luciferase activity (Fig. 3a) . Drugs that decreased the luciferase activity by at least 75% were chosen as primary hit drugs (Fig. 3b) . Eight drugs (Extended Data Table 1 ) were identified as lead hits and further tested for their capacities to decrease the luciferase signal in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 3) . These drugs could potentially function through blocking virus entry, by decreased cell survival, or even by directly inhibiting luciferase activity. To distinguish these possibilities, the lead hit drugs 7 were tested in comparison to hPSC-COs infected with a control VSVG-luciferase reporter virus. Four of the lead hit drugs showed specificity to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoentry virus, including mycophenolic acid (MPA, Fig. 3c ) (SARS-CoV-2: IC 50 =0.54 \u03bc M; VSVG: IC 50 =6.4 \u03bc M), quinacrine dihydrochloride (QNHC, Fig. 3d) (SARS-CoV-2: IC 50 =1.6 \u03bc M; VSVG: IC 50 =5.5 \u03bc M), chloroquine (SARS-CoV-2: IC 50 =6.8 \u03bc M; VSVG: IC 50 =19.1 \u03bc M), and resveratrol (SARS-CoV-2: IC 50 =5.7 \u03bc M; VSVG: IC 50 =39.3 \u03bc M) (Fig. 3e-g, and Extended Data Fig. 3). The IC 50 of MPA is 10 times lower and the IC 50 of QNHC is 5 times lower than that of chloroquine, a drug recently authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19 patients 7 . Immunostaining confirmed few luciferase positive cells in hPSC-COs treated with 3 \u03bc M MPA or 4.5 \u03bc M QNHC at 24 hpi (Fig . 3h) . CO-explanted humanized mice were treated with 50 mg/kg MPA by IP injection, followed by local inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus. At 24 hpi, the mice were euthanized, and xenografts were analyzed by immunostaining.

We adapted a hPSC-derived CO platform for high throughput drug screening. Using disease-relevant normal colonic human cells, we screened 1280 FDA-approved compounds and identified MPA and QNHC, two drugs that can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. Strikingly, in this assay, the efficacies of MPA and QNHC for blocking viral entry are more than 5 times higher than chloroquine, a drug recently authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the MPA concentrations effective in blocking viral entry and replication are below that which is routinely used in clinical therapy 13 . MPA is a 9 reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase and is used widely and safely as an immunosuppressive drug (mycophenolate mofetil; CellCept) to prevent organ rejection after transplantation and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases 14 . MPA has been reported to block replication of human immunodeficiency virus 15 , dengue 16 , as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 17 . Several studies on MERS-CoV suggest that MPA may noncompetitively inhibit the viral papain-like protease while also altering host interferon response 17,18 . A recent study also predicts MPA would modulate the interaction between host protein inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) and SARS-CoV-2 protein nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) 19 . Furthermore, a clinical study of MERS-CoV suggested that the patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil has 0% mortality rate, which is significantly lower than the overall mortality rate as 37% 20 . QNHC (Acriquine \u00ae , Atabrine \u00ae , Atebrin \u00ae , Mepacrine \u00ae ) is an FDA-approved antimalarial drug used more recently as an anthelmintic, antiprotozoal, antineoplastic agent, and antirheumatic 21 . Recent studies have shown that quinacrine protects mice against Ebola virus infection in vivo 22 . Both MPA and QNHC can be considered candidates for clinical trials of COVID-19 therapy. 1 0 Figure Legends",

As a result, there is an urgent need to create new disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 biology and to screen for therapeutics using human disease-relevant tissues. COVID-19 patients typically present with respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, but nearly 25% of patients have gastrointestinal indications including anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, these symptoms are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes 1 . Here, we report using human pluripotent stem cell-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the permissiveness of colonic cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining showed that the putative viral entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple hESC-derived colonic cell types, but highly enriched in enterocytes. Multiple cell types in the COs can be infected by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, which was further validated in vivo using a humanized mouse model. We used hPSC-derived COs in a high throughput platform to Previously, we reported a chemically-defined protocol to derive COs from hPSCs 2 , which we modified slightly based on published studies 3 . In brief, HUES8 hESCs were induced with CHIR99021 (CHIR) and Activin A to generate definitive endoderm (DE) (Extended Data Fig. 1a) . After 4 days of culture with CHIR +FGF4 to induce hindgut endoderm (HE), cells were treated with BMP2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and CHIR for 3 days to promote specification of colon progenitors (CPs). Starting on day 11, CPs were treated with a colonic medium containing CHIR, LDN193189 (LDN), and EGF.",

In brief, hPSC-COs were cultured in 384-well plates. After overnight incubation, organoids were treated with drugs from the library at 10 \u03bc M. One hour post-exposure with drugs, the organoids were innoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus. 24 hpi, the organoids were analyzed for luciferase activity (Fig. 3a) . Drugs that decreased the luciferase activity by at least 75% were chosen as primary hit drugs (Fig. 3b) . Eight drugs (Extended Data Table 1 ) were identified as lead hits and further tested for their capacities to decrease the luciferase signal in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 3) . These drugs could potentially function through blocking virus entry, by decreased cell survival, or even by directly inhibiting luciferase activity. To distinguish these possibilities, the lead hit drugs were tested in comparison to hPSC-COs infected with a control VSVG-luciferase reporter virus. Four of the lead hit drugs showed specificity to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoentry virus, including mycophenolic acid (MPA, Fig. 3c Fig. 3h) . CO-explanted humanized mice were treated with 50 mg/kg MPA by IP injection, followed by local inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus. At 24 hpi, the mice were euthanized, and xenografts were analyzed by immunostaining. Luc + cells in the xenografts of MPA-treated mice were significantly lower than those of vehicletreated mice (Fig. 3i-k) .",

Bulk RNA sequencing confirmed viral transcripts in the SARS-CoV-2 infected hPSC-COs (MOI=0 .1, Fig. 4b) . The MOCK and infected hPSC-COs separated clearly into two distinct clusters in a PCA plot (Fig. 4c) . Differential gene expression analysis showed striking induction of chemokine gene expression, including for IL1A, CXCL8, CXCL6, CXCL11, and IL1B, yet with no detectable levels of IFN-I or IFN-III, which is consistent with recent reports [8] [9] [10] (Fig. 4d) . Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the differential gene expression list highlighted the production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, oxidative phosphorylation, as well as IL-15 production (Fig. 4e) . The hPSC-COs were pre-treated with MPA or QNHC and infected with a relatively high titer of SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI=0.1). Immunostaining confirmed the decrease of SARS-CoV-2 + cells in MPA or QNHC-treated hPSC-COs (Fig. 4f) . In summary, we report that hPSC-derived COs express ACE2 and TMPRS2S2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is currently a lack of physiologically relevant models for COVID-19 disease that enable drug screens. Previous studies were based on clinical data or transgenic animals, for example mice that express human ACE2.",

We adapted a hPSC-derived CO platform for high throughput drug screening. Using disease-relevant normal colonic human cells, we screened 1280 FDA-approved compounds and identified MPA and QNHC, two drugs that can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. Strikingly, in this assay, the efficacies of MPA and QNHC for blocking viral entry are more than 5 times higher than chloroquine, a drug recently authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the MPA concentrations effective in blocking viral entry and replication are below that which is routinely used in clinical therapy 13 . MPA is a reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase and is used widely and safely as an immunosuppressive drug (mycophenolate mofetil; CellCept) to prevent organ rejection after transplantation and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases 14 . MPA has been reported to block replication of human immunodeficiency virus 15 , dengue 16 , as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 17 . Several studies on MERS-CoV suggest that MPA may noncompetitively inhibit the viral papain-like protease while also altering host interferon response 17, 18 . A recent study also predicts MPA would modulate the interaction between host protein inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) and SARS-CoV-2 protein nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) 19 . Furthermore, a clinical study of MERS-CoV suggested that the patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil has 0% mortality rate, which is significantly lower than the overall mortality rate as 37% 20 . QNHC (Acriquine \u00ae , Atabrine \u00ae , Atebrin \u00ae , Mepacrine \u00ae ) is an FDA-approved antimalarial drug used more recently as an anthelmintic, antiprotozoal, antineoplastic agent, and antirheumatic 21 .",

We normalized the gene expression UMI counts for each sample separately using a deconvolution strategy 24 implemented by the R scran package (v.1.14.1). In particular, we pre-clustered cells in each sample using the quickCluster function; we computed size factor per cell within each cluster and rescaled the size factors by normalization between clusters using the computeSumFactors function; and we normalized the UMI counts per cell by the size factors and took a logarithm transform using the normalize function. We further normalized the UMI counts across samples using the multiBatchNorm function in the R batchelor package (v1.2.1). We identified highly variable genes using the FindVariableFeatures function in the R Seurat (v3.1.0) 25 , and selected the top 3000 variable genes after excluding mitochondria genes, ribosomal genes and dissociation-related genes. The list of dissociation-related genes was originally built on mouse data 26 , we converted them to human ortholog genes using Ensembl BioMart. We aligned the two samples based on their mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) using the fastMNN function in the R batchelor package, this was done by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) on the highly variable genes and then correcting the principal components (PCs) according to their MNNs. We selected the corrected top 50 PCs for downstream visualization and clustering analysis. We ran the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction using the RunUMAP function in the R Seurat 25 package with training epochs setting to 2000. We clustered cells into eight clusters by constructing a shared nearest neighbor graph and then grouping cells of similar transcriptome profiles using the FindNeighbors function and FindClusters function (resolution set to 0.2) in the R Seurat package. We identified marker genes for each cluster by performing differential expression analysis between cells inside and outside that cluster using the FindMarkers function in the R Seurat package. After reviewing the clusters, we merged four clusters that were likely from stem cell population into a single cluster (LGR5 + or BMI1 + stem cells) and kept the other four clusters (KRT20 + epithelial cells, MUC2 + goblet cells, EPHB2 + TA cells, and CHGA + NE cells) for further analysis. We re-identified marker genes for the merged five clusters and selected the top 10 positive marker genes per cluster for heatmap plot using the DoHeatmap function in the R Seurat package 25 .",

For definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation, hESCs were cultured to achieve 80-90% confluency, and treated with 3 \u03bc M CHIR99021 (CHIR, Stem-RD) and 100 ng/ml Activin A (R&D systems) in basal medium RPMI1640 (Cellgro) supplemented with 1X Pen-Strep (Gibco) for 1 day, and changed to the basal medium containing only 100 ng/ml Activin A the next day. To induce CDX2 + hindgut endoderm, DE were treated with 3 \u03bc M CHIR99021 and 500 ng/ml FGF4 (Peprotech) in RPMI1640 supplemented with 1X B27 supplement (Gibco) and 1X Pen-Strep (Gibco) for 4 days with daily changing of fresh media. Organoids began to bud out from the 2D culture during the hindgut differentiation process. The hindgut endoderm was then subjected to colonic lineage induction by treatment with 100 ng/ml BMP2 (Peprotech), 3 \u03bc M CHIR99021 and 100 ng/ml hEGF (Peprotech) in Advance DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 1X B27 supplement (Gibco), 1X GlutaMax (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco) and 1X Pen-Strep (Gibco) for 3 days with daily changing of fresh medium. After colonic fate induction, the colon progenitor organoids were collected from the initial 2D cultures and embedded in a 100% Matrigel dome in a 24-well plate. Differentiation to mature colonic cell types was achieved by culturing these colon progenitor organoids in differentiation medium containing 600 nM LDN193189 (Axon), 3 \u03bc M CHIR99021 and 100 ng/ml hEGF in Advance DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 1X B27 supplement, 1X GlutaMax, 10 mM HEPES and 1X Pen-Strep. The differentiation medium was refreshed every 3 days for at least 40 days to achieve full colonic differentiation. The colon organoids were passaged and expanded every 10 -14 days at 1:6 density. To passage the organoids, the Matrigel domes containing the organoids were scrapped off the plate and resuspended in cold splitting media (Advance DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 1X GlutaMax, 10 mM HEPES and 1X Pen-Strep). The organoids were mechanically dislodged from the Matrigel dome and fragmented by pipetting in cold splitting media. The old Matrigel and splitting media were removed after pelleting cells and the organoids were resuspended in 100% Matrigel. 50 \u00b5L Matrigel containing fragmentized colon organoids were plated in one well of a pre-warmed 24-well plate. Cell Lines HEK293T (human [Homo sapiens] fetal kidney) and Vero E6 (African green monkey [Chlorocebus aethiops] kidney) were obtained from ATCC (https://www.atcc.org/).

A total of 10,000 cells were loaded into each channel of the Single-Cell A Chip to target 8000 cells. Briefly, according to manufacturer's instruction, the sorted cells were washed with 1x PBS + 0.04% BSA, counted by a Bio-Rad TC20 Cell Counter, and cell viability was assessed and visualized. A total of 10,000 cells and Master Mixes were loaded into each channel of the cartridge to generate the droplets on Chromium Controller. Beadsin-Emulsion (GEMs) were transferred and GEMs-RT was undertaken in droplets by PCR incubation. GEMs were then broken and pooled fractions recovered. After purification of the first-strand cDNA from the post GEM-RT reaction mixture, barcoded, full-length cDNA was amplified via PCR to generate sufficient mass for library construction. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection were used to optimize the cDNA amplicon size. TruSeq Read 1 (read 1 primer sequence) was added to the molecules during GEM incubation. P5, P7, a sample index, and TruSeq Read 2 (read 2 primer sequence) were added via End Repair, A-tailing, Adaptor Ligation, and PCR.
