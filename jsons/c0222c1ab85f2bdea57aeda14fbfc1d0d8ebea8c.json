Demographic variables (gender and age) and variables that were significantly associated (P < .05) with disease progression were included in the multivariable analysis. Areas under the curve (AUCs; with 95% confidence intervals) were computed to assess the diagnostic values of C-reactive protein (CRP); AUCs >0.70 were considered clinically relevant [11] . The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve and the log-rank test were applied to further assess the potential risk factors associated with progression. The Youden index was implemented to set cutoff values.

In this study, a small fraction of nonsevere patients developed into severe cases in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset. Therefore, health care institutions should also pay close attention to the mild patients, identify progressors early, and provide appropriate treatment to reduce mortality. As reported in a recent article [12] , severe COVID-19 patients were older and were more likely to have underlying disease, which is consistent with our study. Nonsevere patients who progressed to severe cases were older and had a higher probability of having underlying diseases. In terms of the symptoms, patients who progressed from nonsevere to severe were more likely to have shortness of breath. Several published articles have also reported a higher rate of shortness of breath in severe COVID-19 patients [5, 12] . Although these exacerbated patients felt dyspnea at an early stage, their blood oxygen saturation did not reach the standard of severe cases, which may be explained by the compensatory effect of faster breathing.",

To our surprise, many COVID-19 patients in this study showed elevated CRP levels, which is in agreement with other studies [12, 19] . Moreover, aggravated cases in this study showed significantly higher levels of CRP than nonsevere patients, which suggested that CRP may be a serum marker of disease aggravation in COVID-19 patients. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CRP was indeed related to disease progression, and ROC analysis and a KM curve confirmed that CRP was a valuable predictor of disease progression in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. What' s more, the elevated CRP levels occurred before the disease progressed. Therefore, we believe that COVID-19 patients with high levels of CRP should be adequately monitored and treated even though their respiratory function indicators do not meet the criteria for severe cases.",
