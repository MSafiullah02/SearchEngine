Pre-hospital physicians have the potential to restore adequate flow and physiology in severely sick or injured patients, but the subject remains debated [1\u20136]. P-EMS are resource demanding compared with standard paramedic-staffed services [7], and more research is needed to evaluate any potential effects of p-EMS [1, 8, 9]. High-quality research relies on data quality and uniform documentation is essential to ensure reliable and valid data. Currently, p-EMS data are low quality, and the lack of systematic documentation complicates comparison, creating a barrier for high-quality outcome research [10].",

Templates for uniform documentation may facilitate international multi-centre studies, thereby increasing the quality of evidence [11]. Such templates, designed through expert agreement, are valuable and feasible, but they need to be updated on a regular basis due to developments in available equipment and treatment options [12\u201315]. The p-EMS template has been incorporated for daily use in Finland, but it has not yet been implemented in other European countries. A recent study concluded that the published template is feasible for use in p-EMS and that a large amount of data may be captured, facilitating collaborative research [16]. However, the feasibility study revealed areas for improvement of the template. To make the template even more relevant, further revisions should be made.",

To capture these important trends, templates need to be updated regularly. Additionally, the variables shown to be not feasible to document should either be changed or removed. Physiological variables are often reported to be the most often missing variables [38, 39]. In the original template we found the feasibility of collecting physiological data to be good [16], and these variables were not substantially changed in the updated template. Thus, we expect feasibility to be good for physiological variables in the updated template as well.",

Automated data capture from monitors and updated digitized data catchment tools could allow for complete template data to be imported directly into a common registry. This would provide a substantial opportunity for joint research. If such a registry could also link template data to outcomes and standardized coding systems for process and outcome issues, we may be able to assess e.g. for which patients p-EMS are useful, which procedures should be performed out-of-hospital and which procedures should not.
