In the last decades, substantial reductions have been made in the number of measles cases, with an estimated 20 million deaths averted from 2000-2017 [2]. Yet, an important feature of epidemic dynamics is that large outbreaks can occur following years of apparently successful control [3] . Such 'post-honeymoon period' outbreaks are a result of the non-linear dynamics of epidemics [3] . Anticipating post-honeymoon outbreaks could lead to substantial gains in public health, helping to guide the timing, age-range and location of catch-up vaccination campaigns [4] . Theoretical conditions for such outbreaks are well-understood for measles, yet the information required to make these calculations policy-relevant is largely lacking. We propose that a major extension of serological studies to directly characterize measles susceptibility is a high priority.",

Following extinction, the shortest possible waiting time until a post-honeymoon outbreak is determined by the growth of the susceptible population, i.e., the cumulative number of births subsequently unimmunized by vaccination and susceptible individuals who enter the population ( Figure 1B) . Outbreaks can only occur if the size of the susceptible pool is above the threshold for herd immunity, most simply defined as 1/R 0 (the basic reproduction number, R 0 , or expected number of new infections per one infectious individual in a completely susceptible population, which for measles typically ranges from 15 to 20).

Every community is likely to be at risk of re-introduction of measles given current travel patterns and measles incidence ( Figure 1E ). We argue that the key issue is therefore to know how far the population is from the threshold for herd immunity: once the size of the susceptible population exceeds this threshold, longer delays allow a larger pool of susceptibles, and bigger eventual outbreaks. Theoretically, knowledge of vaccination history and incidence are sufficient to project population immunity and characterize the risk and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f urgency of interventions to prevent a post-honeymoon outbreak. In reality, heterogeneity in vaccination coverage [9] combined with uncertainty in vaccination data [6] , and underreporting of disease incidence (also a source of immunity) makes this indirect calculation intractable [10] .",

More recently, analysis of a serological convenience sample taken from fever/rash surveillance estimated a large susceptible population in Madagascar, suggesting the country had been experiencing a `honeymoon period' and was at considerable risk of a measles outbreak [12] . This subsequently occurred ( Figure 1A ).",

            "text": "In practice, serological data necessary for such predictions are rare. We can approach this problem via two immediately available sources of samples, allowing increasing granularity of prediction; there is also potential for a much more comprehensive approach. First, samples that could be leveraged for serological analysis are often available, collected as part of efforts for routine surveillance (such as fever and rash surveillance [12] ), and stored at national reference laboratories in countries around the world. Second, large cross-sectional surveys [11] that include blood samples taken to test for other health outcomes (e.g., HIV prevalence studies) are widespread, often multi-national (e.g., the Demographic Health Surveys) and may be repeated across years, providing the important perspective of changes across time. However, these existing sources of data and samples are not sufficient to provide a systematic assessment of susceptibility in all key contexts. A Global Immunological Observatory [13] , that unified and significantly extended current samples, would allow much more systematic prediction of risk, severity and, importantly, the likely age ranges of measles cases following outbreaks in many settings. Inevitably, no sampling scheme for serological data (whether opportunistic or systematic) will be without uncertainties in terms of range and characteristics of individuals reached, or in our ability to delineate heterogeneities in space and time. Additionally, the measles serological assay has its own challenges including a small by existing probability of false negatives and the necessity for both a laboratory and laboratory expertise to conduct the assay with quality control and assurance. Nevertheless, these threads are likely to bring another key angle on the data already available, and would prove a powerful asset for targeting vaccination campaigns to those communities, age groups or subpopulations at highest risk, ultimately improving the efficiency of campaigns. Furthermore, expanding research in this area could lead to important innovations [13] , such as the ability to distinguish natural and vaccine-induced immunity, which will improve our understanding of vaccination coverage, arguably the critical known unknown. Such advances will yield dividends both in low and middle income countries, where low vaccination coverage is generally driven by logistical barriers; but also in countries where vaccine hesitancy is the main barrier to achieving population immunity, yet vaccination rates are often uncertain in key settings [14] . With the potential for the current COVID-19 pandemic to disrupt vaccination programs, evaluating population measles immunity will become increasingly important to impact on outbreak risk.",
