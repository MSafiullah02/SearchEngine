            "text": "High-density resequencing microarrays were developed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and so produce detailed genetic sequence reads. A resequencing microarray comprises \u201cprobe sets\u201d \u2013 high-density arrangements of short highly specific oligonucleotide probes (25 and 29 used currently) where each base in a reference sequence is queried by four probes. One probe is an exact match of the reference sequence and the other three represent the same section of reference sequence with the central base position replaced by one of the possible SNP variants. In practical use, the number of probes is doubled so that for each base both the forward (sense) and reverse (antisense) directions are contained in a probe set. It is possible to completely \u201cresequence,\u201d resolve every base in the sequence of an unknown sample, the reference sequence itself or any other sequence that differs from the reference by one mismatch or fewer per 25 base pair (bp) (\n1\n). At higher mismatch rates, a large number of bases can still be identified, but an increasing number will fail as the differences increase. This array-based format, combined with specific PCR, has proven ideal for SNP genotyping and phylogenetic analysis (\n2\u20136\n). Initial work demonstrated the advantages of using a resequencing array with many short reference sequences to detect multiple bacterial and viral pathogens (\n7\u201311\n). Taking full advantage of the sequential base resolution capability of resequencing microarrays, similarity searches of DNA databases have been incorporated into the analysis allowing for fine detailed discrimination of closely related pathogens and tracking mutations within the targeted pathogen even with only partial base call resolution in a reference sequence (\n8,\n10\u201312\n).",

            "text": "The effective use of resequencing microarrays for respiratory pathogen detection or any large collection of organisms relies on the integration of several components. The overall design for the resequencing microarray and selection of primers for amplification must occur first. This consists of several tasks: First, selection of organisms and desired level of discrimination for each organism and whether specific nucleic acid markers must be tested for; second, determination from known sequence data of sequence regions to choose reference sequences from; third, selection of reference sequences and check for possible conflicts; fourth, primer selection. The order of several of these steps can be interchanged and refinements consist of repeating several of these steps after making changes. Once fabricated, an amplification method is required in order to achieve the sensitivity required for diagnosis/surveillance applications, so that any of the target pathogens can be detected directly from collected samples. Finally, because so many potential organism detection events are to be dealt with, a standardized algorithm is applied to determine if pathogens are detected and report the maximum level of detail possible using the resolved base sequence information from the multiple-pathogen resequencing microarrays.",

            "text": "Selection of partial genomic sequences from pathogens (reference or target sequences) for placement on a resequencing microarray to provide direct sequence-based identification of multiple pathogens depends on what specific knowledge is required for the various pathogens. For example, the respiratory pathogen microarray v.1 (RPM v.1) chip design includes 57 target genes, partial sequences from the genes containing diagnostic regions of each pathogen (i.e., E1A, hexon, and fiber for human adenoviruses (HAdVs); hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and the matrix genes for influenza A viruses). The targets for both HAdVs and influenza are both long enough that RPM v.1 not only allows identification but also produce strain-specific sequence data at the same time. The remaining respiratory pathogens only required detection, so fewer and shorter partial sequences were selected allowing resequencing of 29.7 kb of sequences to provide at least species level identification of 26 distinct organisms (\n10\n) (Note 8). For the RPM v.1 chip, selection of partial sequences to generate probe sets on the microarray was based on the same rules used in selecting probes for long-oligonucleotide spotted microarrays even though such rules do not account for the strengths and weaknesses of a resequencing microarray. Overall, the detection and discrimination performance of such sequences was good. In fact, probes that for a spotted array would only discern to a particular level such as serotype will at least give the same level of discrimination on a resequencing array and often provide more detailed discrimination such as strain differentiation. Using these selection rules can however lead to wasted space on the resequencing microarray because in some cases where two probes were required on a spotted microarray, the information from only one is sufficient to provide equivalent or greater detection and discrimination on a resequencing microarray. Design methods have since been refined to reduce redundancy and better incorporate the advantages of resequencing arrays into probe selection. Once selected, the sequence file was sent to Affymetrix for fabrication (Note 9).",

A list of sequences that may potentially hybridize to the reference sequence is constructed using a BLAST query. Primers are selected from consensus sequences of well-conserved regions flanking the reference sequence from the list. All potential primers that are 18\u201324 bases in length with \u223c50% GC content, with no repetitive sequences and have annealing temperature range from 55 to 60\u00b0C without potential for self annealing and hairpin formation are considered. This list is further filtered to ensure uniqueness with respect to the other pathogens and human genome by using a full search of the GenBank database with the BLAST program. This insured that the potential primers for an organism have a number of mismatches with these two groups of sequences and would not mis-prime on a sequence region not of interest in the assay (Note 10).Once selected, all primers in the same primer cocktails are checked for potential hybridization to other primers to reduce the potential of primer-dimer formation. The primers that form conceivable primer dimers, 8 or more contiguous base matches between the primers, are replaced with new ones until all potential primer dimers are removed. Also, we adapt a method developed by Shuber et al. and Brownie et al. (\n13,\n14\n) to further suppress primer-dimer formation by adding a linker sequence of 22 bp (primer L) to the 5\u2032-end of primers used (Note 11).To minimize the possibility of intra-primer interactions, the number of primers in a mix is kept to no more than 100. For RPM v.1, the primers were divided into two independent reactions to satisfy this requirement. Fine-tuning adjustments to both mixtures (swapping primers that amplified poorly for new ones) were carried out to ensure all target genes from the 26 targeted pathogens (West Nile Virus is included on the array but not in this amplification scheme) would amplify sufficiently to generate detectable hybridization.

The set of resolved bases resulting from hybridization is instead subjected to a filtering process. Each references sequence is examined by itself and split into possible subsequences (SubSeqs) suitable for BLAST search. SubSeqs are found by finding seed locations within the sequence that have at least 18 of 20 bases resolved. One of these locations is increased in size while the total called base percentage stays above 40% unless a contiguous stretch of at least 18 or 19 bases of N calls is encountered. The section is marked as its own SubSeq if its length is at least 30 bases and the remaining seed locations are examined in a similar manner.BLAST is used to perform a similarity search of the NCBI nr database using the SubSeqs as the queries. The BLAST program used is the NCBI Blastall \u2013p blastn with a defined set of parameters. Masking of low complex regions is performed for the seeding phase; however, such regions are included in the actual scoring. The default gap penalty and nucleotide match score are used. The nucleotide mismatch penalty, \u2013q, parameter is set to \u20131 rather than the default. The results of any BLAST query with an expected value <0.0001 are returned in tabular format from the blastall program. If any SubSeq has a value of 10\u20136 or less then it is considered positive for identification of whatever organism is reported in the return.A SubSeq might return many records from the database with the same score. The identified organism is whatever taxonomic classification encompasses all tied best scoring returns when there are more than one (Note 25). If only a single return has the best score then that is considered the closest specific strain to the organism in the sample.Different SubSeq for the same reference sequence are required to result in a single pathogen identification for that reference sequence. If one SubSeq has a significantly better score and more detailed identification than others that is taken as the identification of the reference sequence. If all SubSeqs have similar scores, then the taxonomic classification that is consistent for all of them is considered the best identification that can be made.A final examination can be made for the results from reference sequences that targeted the same organism to insure that they are reporting consistent results. It is not required that all reference sequences identify an organism nor is strictly required that they make the same exact identification. This process can be very laborious and time consuming considering the large number of reference sequences and automation of this process is possible (Note 26).\n",

GeneChip\u00ae Resequencing Assay Kit also contains control forward 7.5 kb PCR primers (20 \u03bcM) which can replace control forward 1.0 kb PCR primers. However, the 7.5 kb IQ-EX amplification requires using Taq DNA polymerase designed for long-range PCR amplification.Other transcription kits can also be used to generate RNA controls.The MasterPure\u2122 DNA and RNA purification kit gave us the highest yield of nucleic acids, but other nucleic acid extraction kits can also be used for this purpose.For multiplex PCR, it is highly recommended that you test different Taq DNA polymerase. We tested several different Taq DNA polymerases from various companies; our experience suggests that Platinum Taq or GoTaq\u00ae Flexi DNA polymerase give the highest amplification yield.Good laboratory practice, e.g., always use filtered pipette tips, clear gloves, and UV irradiate PCR hood after each PCR set up, is necessary to prevent contamination issue in the PCR. Additionally, 50x dNTPs (ACGU) and uracil-DNA glycosylase are used to prevent trace amount of carry-over contamination from the previous PCR.Other PCR purification kit can also be used for cleaning up PCR products.The fragmentation reagent is an equivalent of DNase I. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and biotinylated ddNTP from other sources can also be used for labeling reaction.The resequencing microarray platform is generally more flexible at target selection. However, the design process can still be very complicated. Fortunately, the RPM v.1 chips are available through Tessarae Inc. (Potomac Falls, VA) with the permission from US Naval Research Laboratory. Newer version of RPM (RPM v.3.x) can be also obtained through Tessarae, Inc. (Potomac Falls, VA) with complete protocol. So initial use of the assay does not require design of a microarray.The details of how to make Affymetrix CustomSeq resequencing microarray is described in GeneChip\u00ae CustomSeq Custom Resequencing Array Design Guide (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/other/customseq_design_manual.pdf). Briefly, the first step is to identify and generate the base sequences of interest in FASTA format. Once the content of the array has been selected, the total number of bases is calculated and an array format (different formats have different sequence capacities) is chosen. The sequence submission documents can then be prepared from this information (design request form, sequence and instruction files and purchase order). During the fabrication process at Affymetrix, their chip design group will perform a design clarification process which will check and suggest removing ambiguous, repetitive and homologous sequences. Upon completion of this step, the masks required to produce chips are fabricated and checked for quality. Finally, the arrays will be manufactured. The clarification process can take as little as 2 weeks if little feedback is required but can run longer and the production of chips depends upon scheduling constraints to meet delivery to all their customers.Primers selected should have at least three base mismatches with human genome sequences to avoid non-specific amplification.Short linker primers can also be used, but the linker primers must be unique with higher melting temperature and unrelated to the target pathogens and background genome sequences that the samples may contain.Try to avoid lipid and small white powdery protein substances in the supernatant.If you air dry the pellet too long, you will need to add nuclease-free water to the pellet and store at 4\u00b0C overnight to ensure the complete suspension of the nucleic acids.Internal control is not absolutely necessary for the reaction, but it is good to ensure there is no false negative result due to the RT or PCR step. Other genes besides NAC1 and TIM can also be used for internal controls provided the custom design chip has reference sequences to hybridize with the control genes.Do not use 50x dNTPs (ACGU, Sigma) at this step.Two-step PCR are used here to shorten the cycling time, alternatively, a three-step PCR can be used as long as the annealing temperature is raised enough to switch to linker only priming.Smaller amount of elution buffer can be used; EB buffer can be used to bring up the volume for the next step.Longer incubation time is recommended for both fragmentation (30 min) and labeling (2 h) by Affymetrix. However, our experience suggested that a shorter incubation time is sufficient.It is recommended that the chip should be warm up to room temperature before performing pre-hybridization. Our experiences suggested that this is not a critical step.It is recommended that the hybridization should be carried out for 16 h in order to reach equilibrium. Our experience indicates that 4 h hybridization can generate sufficient base call for pathogen identification.Wash A can also be used to fill the chip at this stage. Chips can be stored for up to 24 h before washing.Chips can still be scanned after storing for more than 24 h and less than 1 week, although the fluorescence signal will be weaker.The base calling algorithm for resequencing microarray is changed to allow for the most \u201cpermissive\u201d base calling to be executed compared to \u201cconservative\u201d settings that are defaults for GDAS. The parameters are listed below:\n\u201cPermissive\u201d Base Calling Algorithm Settings \u2013Filter Conditions  i.No Signal threshold = 0.500 (default = 1.000000)  ii.Weak Signal Fold threshold = 20000.000 (default = 20.000000)  iii.Large SNR threshold = 20.000000 (default = 20.000000)\nAlgorithm Parameters  i.Strand Quality Threshold = 0.000 (default = 0.000000)  ii.Total Quality Threshold = 25.0000 (default = 75.000000)  iii.Maximum Fraction of Heterozygote Calls = 0.99000 (default = 0.900000)  iv.Model Type (0 = Heterozygote, 1 = Homozygote) = 1  v.Perfect Call Quality Threshold = 0.500 (default = 2.000000)\nFinal Reliability Rules  i.Min Fraction of Calls in Neighboring Probes = 1.0000 (disables filter)  ii.Min Fraction of Calls of Samples = 1.0000 (disables filter)\n\nResequencing arrays provide positional information which allows for the use of similarity searches; however, because of how the information is obtained they can potentially bias for or against variants with insertions or deletions depending on the reference sequence selected. Splitting regions that are separated by large sections of N calls reduces this bias.The organism identified may not necessarily be the primary organism the reference sequence is intended to identify but a near-neighbor species.The algorithm as described was built into a new software program, Computer-Implemented Biological Sequence-based Identifier system, version 2 (CIBSI 2.0) to automate the pathogen identification process for the RPM v.1 array (\n12\n). CIBSI 2.0 besides determining what each reference sequence detects furthermore, whether the identifications from separate targets support a common organism identification and determine whether detected organisms belong to the target set that the assay was designed to detect or are related to close genetic near neighbors. Target pathogens are the organisms the assay was specifically designed to detect.\n",
