The Herpesviridae family (GenBank TaxID 10292, with 73 completely sequenced virus genomes as of May 2017) includes viruses that infect amniotes; typically, a pair of virus species from this family shares dozens of protein-coding genes recognized by high amino acid sequence similarity (Davison, 2010). The family Alloherpesviridae (TaxID 548682, 8 completely sequenced genomes) includes viruses of fishes and amphibians. These viruses have been reported to share only 13 core orthologous genes with each other, suggesting that this group is more divergent than the family Herpesviridae (van Beurden and Engelsma, 2012). The third family, Malacoherpesviridae (TaxID 548685), includes two ICTV-approved members, Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) and Haliotid herpesvirus 1 (HaHV-1), which infect bivalve and gastropod molluscs, respectively. In addition to the herpesvirus-like morphology of their virions and capsids, as well as the genomic repeat features, these two viruses were reported to have 39 orthologous genes in common (Savin et al., 2010), some of which are related to enzymes that play essential roles in other herpesviruses, for example, the large subunit of virus terminase ATPase and family B replicative DNA polymerase. However, no gene products with similarity to herpesvirus structural proteins have been reported in Malacoherpesviridae. Interestingly, a putative virus related to mollusc herpesviruses has been detected by sequence database searches, among the contigs co-assembled with the portions of the draft genome of a cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae (Savin et al., 2010). Taken together, these genomic data suggest that the order Herpesvirales is characterized by higher genomic diversity, broader host range, and, likely, deeper phylogeny than was assumed just a decade ago.",

            "text": "In contrast to our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within Herpesivirales, the evolutionary origin of this order as a whole remains uncertain. The picture is clearer in the case of structural proteins. One domain, \u201cthe floor domain\u201d, in the large multi-domain capsid proteins of vertebrate herpesviruses, whose structure has been determined by a cryoEM approach, is structurally similar to bacteriophage capsid proteins with the HK97 fold (Baker et al., 2005, Yu et al., 2017). Moreover, mechanistic similarities in the maturation pathways of these diverse virus particles have been noted (Casjens and King, 1975, Booy et al., 1991, Davison, 2002, Mettenleiter et al., 2009, Veesler and Johnson, 2012), and sequence comparisons have established the ancestral relationship of the capsid maturation protease between phages and Herpesviridae (Cheng et al., 2004, Liu and Mushegian, 2004). That relationship is further supported by the demonstration that the high-resolution structure of phage protease is folded very similarly to the herpesvirus assemblin proteases, whose structure has been determined earlier (Fokine and Rossmann, 2016). Along with the long-known monophyly of the large (ATPase) subunit of phage and virus terminases (Mitchell et al., 2002), these observations point at the common origin of the entire head/capsid formation module in Herpesviridae and in a subset of tailed viruses of bacteria and archaea.",

Searches were done with the BLAST family of programs (Altschul et al., 1997) with the \u201cComposition-based statistics\u201d option. The HHPred server (S\u00f6ding et al., 2005; Alva et al., 2016) was used to compare profile-Hidden Markov Models (HMM) of virus proteins to profile-HMMs built from the entries in the NCBI CDD database (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2017), with multiple sequence alignment generation method set to PSI-BLAST, re-aligning the results with MAC set to 0.3, and the remaining options set to default values. Multiple sequence alignments were computed using the MUSCLE program (Edgar, 2004), joining closely related (family level and below) sequences, and combining the alignments obtained at that first step using the -profile option of MUSCLE. When distantly related proteins were to be aligned with structural constraints, the PROMALS3D server was used (Pei and Grishin, 2014).

Less is known about the base itself, other than that its structure comprises mostly loops and a few helices (Bowman et al., 2003). Our results, however, indicate that the base is made of the best-conserved portion of the MCP sequence; indeed, conserved regions 1 and 2, distal in the sequence as they are, come together in the three-dimensional structure to account for almost the entirety of the base (visualized in Additional files 1 and 2).

Very recently, the atomic structure of the entire MCP of HHV-5 has been determined by cryo-EM to 3.9 \u00c5 resolution, revealing that a modified HK97 fold is present in the structure, but it is assembled in space from several distal segments of the peptide chain. This can be explained as a series of insertions of several very large domains into the loops of the HK97 \u201cfloor\u201d domain. The relative arrangement of the predicted secondary structure elements along much of the lengths of ORF68 and VP5 homologs is similar (Additional file 3), suggesting structural conservation of multiple domains in these proteins; the structural discontinuity of the HK97 domain helps to understand the difficulties of establishing sequence homology in these regions of herpesvirus MCPs. The conserved region 3 (Fig. 1A) corresponds to the \u201cbuttress domain\u201d, which appears to play a role in interactions between MCP subunits within the capsomer, as well as between MCP and \u201ctriplexes\u201d that stabilize the capsomers (Yu et al., 2017). A better understanding of the role of conserved sequence elements within the buttress domain shown in Fig. 1A awaits the atomic model of this region.",

Interestingly, the configuration of putative catalytic residues in malacoherpesvirus proteases is reminiscent of phage capsid proteases, in that the most C-terminal member of the predicted catalytic triad is an acidic residue as in phage enzymes, rather than by histidine as in assemblins of Herpesviridae. The C-terminal part of the ORF73 product has a reduced compositional complexity; this is similar to the scaffold protein domains, which in some other herpesviruses are likewise compositionally biased and form a fusion with the protease that self-cleaves following the capsid assembly (Newcomb et al., 2000; Veesler et al., 2014). Here again, sequences from Alloherpesviridae are outliers: we did not recognize any sequence homolog of assemblin among alloherpesvirid genes, including ORF78 product of Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 and its orthologs, for which such role has been assigned based on several lines of circumstantial evidence (Michel et al., 2010, Davison et al., 2013).",

Nonetheless, identification of sequence similarities in three structural components of the capsid and in the capsid maturation protease, together with the catalytic subunit of terminase ATPase detected earlier, suggests that the structural module of malacoherpesviruses is mostly or entirely homologous to other herpesviruses, and the ancient connections to ancestors from viruses of prokaryotes are retained in morphogenetic modules of diverse Herpesvirales.",

Interestingly, a pair of paralogous proteins (products of ORF25 and ORF102 in HaHV-1) is found in all malacoherpesviruses. Database searches demonstrated that homologs of ORF25 and ORF102 are found in many animal genomes, including diverse aquatic invertebrates and terrestrial arthropods. In addition, an initial BLASTP search seeded with ORF25 recovered a match (p-value < 10\u22126) to a putative glycoprotein of Hubei myriapoda virus 8, an RNA virus with a negative-strand RNA genome that has been characterized in a large-scale arthropod metagenomic effort (Shi et al., 2016). Further searches suggest that these proteins are related to structural proteins from several other animal viruses with different types of genome organization. Their distant homologs include spike proteins of positive-strand RNA toroviruses and coronaviruses, as well as baculovirus F proteins (see full list of matches in Additional File 4). All these genes encode virus membrane envelope proteins that facilitate virus contact with the host receptor, virus-cell membrane fusion and virus entry into the cell (Belouzard et al., 2012, Baquero et al., 2015, Palgen et al., 2015). More distant relationships (Additional File 4) link a sub-region within these proteins to the envelope proteins of the Ty3-copia-class retrotransposons in insects (virus family Metaviridae), as well as their domesticated homologs of those proteins, such as the Iris gene product in Drosophila (Malik and Henikoff, 2005). Conservation of this region in integrated copies of metaviruses would explain the matches between ORF25/ORF102 family to other animal genomes.",

One gene product, ORF105, appears to belong to the herpesvirus UL92 family, which in betaherpesviruses and gammaherpesviruses is essential for the expression of the true-late transcripts encoding the virion proteins (Omoto and Mocarski, 2014). Another gene product, ORF86, is erroneously annotated in the database as a methyltransferase, but appears to be a homolog of the TnpB protein, known to occur in the IS200/IS605 class of transposons in prokaryotes, as well as in various eukaryotic transposable elements and NCLDV genomes (Bao and Jurka, 2013); it contains an N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain and RuvC-like putative nuclease domain with inserted Zn ribbon (Bao and Jurka, 2013, Makarova and Koonin, 2015).

The orthologs of the first two gene products are also found in all Herpesvirales. To understand the phylogenetic relationships between these two virus groups, we assessed the phylogenetic position of herpesvirus DNA polymerases. A multiple alignment of viral and cellular Family B polymerases was constructed, and the alignment of 364 amino acid positions was used to infer an unrooted maximum-likelihood tree, shown in\nFig. 2 (the source file of the tree in Newick format is available as Additional File 5). The known monophyletic groups of eukaryotic and archaeal DNA polymerases are observed in the tree, and most of the virus taxa approved by ICTV are seen as statistically supported clades, though neither of the two orders, proposed Megavirales and approved Herpesvirales, resolved as monophyletic. Instead, both orders were split by a well-supported (bootstrap value 0.88) internal partition in the tree. On the one side of the split, DNA polymerases of Herpesviridae join an assembly of NCLDV families and, at a longer evolutionary distance, eukaryotic DNA polymerases delta. The other side includes DNA polymerases of Alloherpesviridae and Malacoherpesviridae, together with their poxvirus, baculovirus and bacteriophage homologs and an assembly of various eukaryotic and archaeal polymerases.",

However, the topology of the tree shown in Fig. 2 should be interpreted with caution; viral sequences evolve at a high rate, resulting in long branches in the trees and ensuing topological artifacts, the best-studied of which is long branch attraction (Bergsten, 2005). Indeed, most virus branches in the tree are long, and the branches leading to Alloherpesviridae and Malacoherpesviridae DNA polymerases are the longest ones; together with generally high divergence in the family, this may obscure the identity of their true nearest evolutionary neighbors. An earlier study (Yutin and Koonin, 2012) also showed that in the DNA polymerase tree Megavirales do not resolve as a clade unless the tree topologies are pre-constrained. More recently, another phylogeny of DNA polymerases has been presented, in which Megavirales and Herpesvirales are seen as two monophyletic lineages (Kazlauskas et al., 2016), albeit the sampling of herpesviruses was much narrower in that study than in the current case.",

Putative herpesvirus-like isolated from other aquatic Metazoa, such as two species of stony corals and wild-caught Hydra sp., have been reported (Vega Thurber et al., 2008, Grasis et al., 2014, Correa et al., 2016). Caution has been advised in interpreting these results (Houldcroft and Breuer, 2015; Wood-Charlson et al., 2015; Sweet and Bythell, 2016), and our reanalysis of the three publicly available short sequences from these studies annotated as fragments of anthozoan herpesvirus DNA suggests that they are in fact of bacterial and fungal provenance (Additional File 6). The existence of herpesviruses of coelenterates is nevertheless likely, given that particles with herpesvirus-like morphology have been observed in coral Acropora (Correa et al., 2016). Another recent report of a virus with herpes-like virion morphology in blue king crab Paralithodes platypus (Ryazanova et al., 2015) appears to be corroborated by sequence similarity analysis, which suggests that the DNA fragment specifically amplified from the diseased tissue is closely related to alloherpesvirus DNA polymerase (Additional file 6).",

To study this possibility further, we tested whether the herpes-like contigs found within assembled genomes of Branchiostoma and Capitella show evidence of relaxed selective constraints. We used the RELAX method (Wertheim et al., 2015), which contrasts two probabilistic evolutionary models, one in which relaxation of selection is allowed in a specific branch and the other in which relaxation is not allowed. The test then compares the log-likelihoods of the two competing models. The results of this analysis, summarized in\nTable 2, show no evidence of relaxed selection in the Capitella and Branchiostoma virus-like genes. This may suggest that these sequences represent bona fide viruses that were sequenced together with their host. If, on the other hand, this DNA is integrated into the host genome (the possibility supported in the case of B. floridae by the recent deposition in the database of shotgun sequence of the gonad-derived genomic DNA of another cephalochordate, B. belcheri, which also includes a complement of herpesvirus genes, including for example the major capsid protein homolog XP_019628941), the integration event must have taken place recently enough so that a change in selective constraints had no time to leave an imprint on the protein-coding sequences.",

We expect that re-sequencing of virus-like replicons associated with the amphioxus and annelid genomes will reveal more gene products shared with other herpesviruses. Based on these data and the evidence in the literature, the fraction of widely conserved genes (in the first approximation, having homologs beyond the family level) in herpesviruses may be at least 30% and perhaps closer to 50%, similarly to what has been suggested for bacteriophages with similarly-sized DNA genomes (Kristensen et al., 2011, Grazziotin et al., 2017).

A general principle of virus evolution has emerged, i.e., that the hallmark genes in major groups of viruses of eukaryotes are related, sometimes distantly, to phage genes with similar functions, with additional contribution of genes acquired from mobile elements and host genomes. The genome replication gene modules in many groups of viruses are derived from different phage sources than the structural genes. Putative order Megavirales, all RNA viruses, and certain classes of DNA viruses with smaller genomes represent distinct variations on this general theme (Koonin et al., 2015; Iranzo et al., 2017).",

A core set of morphogenetic genes appears to be conserved in at least two families of Herpesvirales and is more distantly related to homologs in phages with HK97-type capsids. In contrast, several essential herpesvirus genome replication factors, such as Family B DNA polymerase and DNA Prim-Pol primase, appear to have an ancient origin and possible ancestral relationship to the hallmark genes of Megavirales, whose structural module is distinct from that of herpesviruses.",

These genes may have been confined to each lineage of eukaryotic viruses ever since; unlike several other enzymes with roles in DNA synthesis in the same virus orders, these essential replication genes do not appear to have been horizontally transferred between these viruses and their hosts, except for occasional integration of the whole virus DNA into the host genome.",

Curiously, the capsid proteins of the former type are relatively narrowly distributed in the known phages, but are found, either in single jelly-roll or in an internally duplicated form, in eukaryotic viruses that infect nearly all major clades of eukaryotes (Krupovic and Koonin, 2017). The latter type of capsid displays the opposite trend, i.e., it is found in many groups of bacterial and archaeal viruses, but among eukaryotic viruses it has been identified in just one order infecting Metazoa. The reasons for these asymmetries and for the association of a specific capsid type with nuclear vs. nucleocytoplasmic replication cycle are unknown. It is quite likely, however, that better sampling of viruses from diverse hosts and from the environment will improve virus phylogeny and provide better understanding of the emergence of the two major lineages of eukaryotic large dsDNA viruses with their distinct replication strategies.",
