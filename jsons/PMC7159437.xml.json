Moreover, wide experimentation with GM technologies is currently taking place within the public research systems of developing countries. The challenge for developing countries thus seems to be how to manage the risks associated with biotechnology, not whether to deploy it, particularly since biotechnological benefits would be mostly domestic\u2014to their own producers and consumers. Yet due to the popular opinion against these technologies and the regulatory requirements prompted by these concerns, in the European Union and East Asia, the costs of environmental and other risk assessment are large\u2014and they are mounting.",

From an ethical as well as developing country perspective, in an interconnected world, there is an urgent need for the global community to develop holistic, credible, independent, scientific standards and procedures for assessing the net socioeconomic and environmental impacts of biotechnologies, together with the necessary complementary global, regional, and national public policies, institutions, and investments. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), with its large gene banks, 16 international centers spread around the world and track record of helping with food security of millions of the poor could possibly be positioned to perform some of the global functions.",

The new tools are already being applied in a variety of human and animal health\u2010related issues\u2014for example, to develop vaccines for AIDS and malaria, immunization for other commonly encountered diseases, and to improve diagnostic tools for tropical diseases, among others. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and bilateral donors have provided several million dollars for such research (Govindaraj and Sarna). Biotechnology is helping the developing countries and the CGIAR centers in germplasm enhancement including gene identification and characterization, marker assisted selection, DNA sequencing and finger printing, transformation for herbicide and drought resistance, enhancement of nutritional quality, and control of animal diseases (Lele et al., p. 44). Animal disease control in developing countries has far reaching global health implications. Foot and mouth disease alone causes losses estimated at $12 billion. An estimated 50% of organisms are naturally transmitted from livestock and wild species to humans. The recent rapid DNA sequencing of the SARS virus demonstrated the high return to the new biological tools. SARS caused damage of well over $30 billion to China and East Asian economies.",

Credible empirical evidence is emerging from the studies of the early trials and/or adoption of Bt cotton in China (Pray et al., pp. 423\u2013430), India (Quim and Zilberman, pp. 900\u2013902), Mexico (Traxler et al.) and Bt maize in South Africa (Ismael, Bennet, and Morse) that suggests more stable and/or higher yields in selected locales compared to conventional varieties under comparable circumstances. The new GM technology (in the form of seed and related inputs) is highly divisible and per unit of output farm production costs are reported to be low due to the reduced use of pesticides and labor. Using these studies Traxler estimated positive incremental profits per hectare in Bt cotton production relative to conventional varieties across countries although with substantial variation in the level of profits among countries. Less visible but important benefits reported by Pray et al. in China include improved human health and well being as a result of the reduced application of chemical inputs and less use of labor. They report well over 4 million farmers had planted GM cotton in the Yellow River Delta by 2001 with substantial increase in cotton production.",

Area under transgenic crops is growing more rapidly in developing than developed countries, albeit from a smaller base (James, p. 8). Six developing countries had over 25% of the global share of 150 odd million acres of transgenic crops in 2002. China leads, but India, with the largest acreage of cotton, and Mexico, the cradle of biodiversity in maize, are following in the case of cotton, along with Indonesia, South Africa, and Kenya in other crops. From their Next Harvest Study of public GM crops, Luijben and Cohen report 52 crops under transformation and field testing events in 16 transition and developing economies, more than twice the number of the crops covered by the CGIAR (Luijben and Cohen). Crops entering international trade\u2014soybeans, maize, cotton, and canola\u2014dominate, but \u201corphan crops\u201d grown by the poor are beginning to attract attention.",

            "text": "A rare early comparative study of biotechnlogy in an entire system of genetic improvement chain from technology development to adoption and bringing in developed and developing countries' perspective, draws on the studies of Pray and others in China, Mexico, and the United States (Traxler). It suggests farmer share in total benefits as high as 88% and 86% from GM crops in developing countries like China and Mexico, respectively, compared to the farmer share of 45% in the U.S. cotton industry. Traxler argues that although the high cost of basic research on biotechnology is confined to a handful of multinational companies, the process of plant breeding using the particular genes is relatively low cost and can be afforded by most developing countries (Traxler). Technology transfer takes place through licensing. Absence of enforcement of IPRs benefits farmers and maximizes the production of GM crops, Giannakas argues that zero enforcement is an optimal strategy for developing country governments wishing to maximize adoption and maintain competitiveness of their producers vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis producers in competing countries. Multinational private companies, nevertheless, are conducting most of the trials in developing countries. Excluding China during the 1991\u201399 period, as many as 630 trials were undertaken by multinational companies compared to 87 by the developing country private sector and 97 by the developing country public sector (Traxler). But this proportion may be changing rapidly. The number of commercial seed companies in developing countries, virtually absent around the time of the green revolution in the 1970s is growing. Furthermore, many multinational corporations have acquired seed companies in developing countries.",

Well over 70% of developed country private sector research was on genomics with 80% of the intellectual property emanating from it. Although multinational acquisitions of private sector companies in developing countries has increased considerably, private sector research by multinationals in developing countries has perhaps not increased to the same extent, most of the investments being for the \u201cDevelopment\u201d aspect of the Research and Development (R&D) chain.",

First, despite a handful of multinationals controlling intellectual property, fragmented ownership of intellectual property is a huge problem. The example of 40 to 70 IPRs needing negotiations in the case of golden rice is often cited (Lele et al.; Nottenberg, Pardey, and Wright). There are the related issues of asymmetric information on patents, the high transaction costs of negotiations, the highly variable and confused regulatory environment for IPRs among countries, the reduced freedom to operate and generally higher than necessary costs of conversion of research into commercial products (Nottenberg, Pardey, and Wright; Cohen and Paarlberg; Graff and Zilberman). These interrelated phenomena are leading some analysts of the evolving IPR situation to describe the growing phenomenon of IPRs as the \u201cglobal anti\u2010commons\u201d (Commission on International Property Rights). It is also leading to the emergence of new innovative approaches to establish clearing houses and information networks.",

This will depend in part on the protection of IPRs. Concurrently, investment in biotechnology by the public sectors of large developing countries such as China, India, and Brazil is growing. However, information on these public sector investments and the nature of their interaction with the private sector is still incomplete. Moreover, even large developing countries cannot match the resources of multinational companies. And all acknowledge that small and/or low income developing countries, especially in Africa, do not have the capacity to invest in biotechnology research and particularly to support research on crops with limited market prospects (and therefore of limited interest to multinational corporations) but of substantial interest to poor farmers with low risk tolerance. Hence the importance of public sector investment at the global level through such entities as the CGIAR, as well as of South\u2010South cooperation, both issues are discussed in the recently conducted meta evaluation of the CGIAR in the World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (Lele et al.).",

Only some of these issues are resolvable through increased research, testing, and assessment. Although costly, particularly from the perspective of resource\u2010strapped developing countries, such research and the labeling of biotechnology products will have to grow in response to the EU requirements and guidelines for labeling.

Land use changes prompted even from traditional plant breeding have tended to be complex and highly controversial depending on the precise nature of technical change and factor endowments. For instance, at the ecosystem level, the green revolution in the land short labor surplus India saved millions of hectares of land and diversified land use but at the farming system level increased mono cropping of wheat and rice. In contrast, improved soybean production in Brazil's land surplus labor\u2010short Amazon region resulted in increased land clearing for soybean production (Angelsen and Kaimowitz, pp. 73\u201378). Proponents argue that genetic engineering permits a more diversified cropping pattern. Yet it does pose the risk of gene escape.",

This was notwithstanding active maize trade under NAFTA with the United States, a producer of transgenic corn. But the controversy surrounding the alleged discovery of transgenic DNA in traditional varieties of maize grown in the remote highlands of Oaxaca region in Mexico has already involved prestigious scientific establishments such as the University of California, Berkley scientists, the Nature magazine, multinational corporations involved in GM crops, and NGOs (Mann, 1617\u201318). The controversy goes to show the high stakes, the high costs, as well as the fundamental importance of urgently putting in place credible, independent scientific assessments and broadly accepted procedures. The need for such international standards and procedures is particularly high, although costly in terms of time, resources, and expertise, from the perspective of developing countries because the claims also touched CGIAR's Centro International de Mejorameinto de Maiz y Trigo (CIMMYT) but turned out to be without foundation. These claims potentially jeopardize food security not simply of the poor in Mexico but of those other developing countries that rely on the CGIAR maize germplasm to increase maize productivity in their countries.",

Whereas overall international trade has become more open, agricultural trade is highly managed. Overall OECD agricultural trade policies, costing well over $350 billion annually, lower world market prices, and cause lower agricultural exports, higher food imports, higher poverty rates and increased debt for developing countries (Nogues; Gardner). The subsidies are also regressive in terms of income distribution both within and across countries. In the case of cotton, the mainstay of several poor countries in West Africa, 25,000 large U.S. cotton producers received $3.6 billion of agricultural subsidies in 2001, with price declines in Benin alone leading 250,000 cotton\u2010dependent people to fall below the poverty line (Watkins, pp. 10\u201312). Tariffs imposed by industrial countries on processed agricultural commodities from developing countries are several times higher than tariffs on nonprocessed commodities. Thus the future import dependence of developing countries depends not only on how well they manage their domestic policies and natural resources and embrace technical change to remain internationally competitive but on the agricultural policies of OECD countries.",
