However, produced by humans and their activities, it has harmful effects on man\u2019s environment and resources (Mendil and Ulu\u00f6zlu 2007). The discharge of various pollutants into the aquatic environments is the outcome of countless anthropogenic activities, threatening the health of the living beings and damaging the quality of the environment by rendering water bodies unsuitable (Abowel and Sikoki 2005; Ekubo and Abowel 2011). Aquatic environments are pickers for anthropogenic contamination and industrial wastes and leaks, whether chemicals or solid pollutants (Hampel et al. 2015; Bhat et al. 2017). These wastes can be \u201cheavy metals, detergents, microfibers, plastic or non-plastic origin,\u201d etc., and contribute to \u201caquatic pollution problems\u201d (Hampel et al. 2015). Aquatic environs are addressee for plenty of pollutants and their outrageous toxic actions (Hampel et al. 2015). \u201cChemicals reaching aquatic ecosystems include radioactive elements\u201d (\u201cstrontium, cesium, radon\u201d), metals (\u201ccadmium, mercury, lead\u201d), industrial solvents and \u201cvolatile organic compounds\u201d (\u201ctri- and tetrachloroethylene, chlorofluorocarbons, benzene, xylenes, formaldehyde\u201d), \u201cagrochemicals\u201d (\u201cfertilizers and pesticides\u201d), household products (\u201cdetergents, cleaners, paints\u201d), \u201cfuel combustion\u201d (\u201cN and sulfur oxides,\u201d \u201cpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,\u201d \u201ccarbon monoxide,\u201d and \u201ccarbon dioxide\u201d), \u201cnanoparticles,\u201d personal care products, \u201cmicroplastics, antibiotics,\u201d as well as a huge variety of prescription (Hampel et al. 2015)\u201d and \u201cnonprescription drugs and pharmaceuticals of human and veterinary medicine\u201d (Hughes et al. 2013; Larsson 2014; Malaj et al. 2014; Hampel et al. 2015).",

            "text": "\u201c Aquatic ecosystems, particularly the freshwater ecosystems, are exposed to supplementary contamination than other environs, as water is used in various industrial practices as well as release of discharges commencing from industry\u201d and urban growths (Demirak et al. 2006; Fernandesa et al. 2007). \u201c Water pollution is a worldwide task that has augmented in both advanced and emerging nations\u201d (Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017). \u201cUniversally, 80% of municipal wastewater is discharged into water bodies untreated, and industry is responsible for dumping millions of tons of heavy metals\u201d (Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017), \u201csolvents, toxic sludge and other wastes into water bodies each year\u201d (WWAP 2017; Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017). Agriculture, exploits \u201c70% of water globally and plays a key part in water contamination\u201d (Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017). Huge amounts of \u201cagrochemicals,\u201d \u201corganic matter,\u201d \u201cdrug residues,\u201d \u201csediments,\u201d and \u201csaline drainage\u201d from agricultural lands are released into water bodies (Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017) and hence poses significant threats to \u201caquatic environments,\u201d \u201chuman health,\u201d and \u201cproductive activities\u201d (UNEP 2016; Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017). Most aquatic ecosystems have a natural tendency to dilute pollution to some extent, but severe contamination of aquatic ecosystems results in alteration in the fauna and flora of the community (Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017). The onset of human civilization in itself discloses the history of aquatic pollution (Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017). Moreover, aquatic pollution did not receive significant consideration until a threshold level was reached with hostile outcomes on the \u201cecosystems\u201d and \u201cliving organisms\u201d including \u201chumans\u201d (Halpern et al. 2008; Mateo-Sagasta et al. 2017). Therefore, \u201cpollution and its effects are considered as one of man\u2019s greatest crimes against himself. Pollutants may cause primary damage, with direct identifiable impact on the environment, or secondary damage in the form of minor perturbations in the delicate balance of the biological food web that are detectable only over long time periods\u201d (Sharma 2012; Al Naggar et al. 2014; Ghani 2015). Thus, \u201cmaintaining the quality of aquatic ecosystems represents one of the most formidable challenges facing global society in the twenty-first century\u201d (Hampel et al. 2015).",

            "text": "The greatest volume of \u201cwaste discharged into the aquatic ecosystems is sewage.\u201d Sewage contains \u201cindustrial wastes, municipal wastes and domestic wastes which include wastes from baths, washing machines, kitchens and faecal matter.\u201d Fresh water sources \u201cserve as best sinks for the discharge of these wastes\u201d (Das and Acharya 2003; Tukura et al. 2009). It is estimated that \u201c58% of the wastewater from urban areas and 81% of industrial wastes are discharged directly into water bodies with no or inadequate treatment results in contamination of ~73% of the water bodies\u201d (Vargas-Gonzalez et al. 2014). The release of \u201csewage has led to the increase in water pollution and depletion of clean water resources\u201d (Avalon Global Research 2012). \u201cHuge loads of such wastes are generated daily from highly populated cities and are finally washed out by the drainage systems which generally open into nearby rivers or aquatic systems\u201d (Tukura et al. 2009). It has resulted in \u201cextensive ecological degradation such as a decline in water quality and availability, intense flooding, loss of species, and changes in the distribution and structure of the aquatic biota\u201d (Oberdorff et al. 2002). The \u201cnegative impact of sewage is based on the composition and concentration of the contaminants as well as the volume and frequency of wastewater effluents entering water bodies\u201d (Akpor and Muchie 2011; Bhat et al. 2017). \u201cSewage is comprised of several microorganisms, heavy metals, nutrients, radionuclides, pharmaceutical, and personal care products.\u201d Sewage is primarily organic in nature; owing to the organic load of sewage, the \u201coxygen concentration in the receiving waters is reduced, thus sewage is said to have a high BOD.\u201d The \u201ceffect of maltreated sewage on surface water is largely determined by the oxygen balance of the aquatic ecosystem, and its presence is essential in maintaining biological life within the system\u201d (DFID 1999; Morrison et al. 2001; Momba et al. 2006). \u201cDO concentrations below 5 mg/L can have a negative effect on the living organisms in the aquatic ecosystem\u201d (Momba et al. 2006). Low dissolved oxygen concentration can affect \u201cfunctioning of some fish species and can eventually lead to the death of fish population\u201d (Igbinosa and Okoh 2009; Mehmood et al. 2019). Decaying \u201c organic matter\u201d and \u201cnutrients such as nitrites, nitrates, and phosphorus\u201d in sewage can induce \u201ceutrophication of water courses.\u201d \u201cEutrophication can lead to growth of plants and algae blooms\u201d in the \u201caquatic ecosystem\u201d (Bhat et al. 2017). \u201cAlgal blooms result in toxin production.\u201d Fish species \u201cfeeding in water contaminated\u201d by \u201calgal toxins will absorb these toxins and are subject to mass mortality\u201d (Hernandez et al. 1998). Due to \u201ceutrophication turbidity of the water increases, plant and animals\u2019 biomass increases, sedimentation rate increases, species diversity decreases, and anoxic conditions may develop, and this could give rise to change in dominant species of the aquatic biota\u201d (Edokpayi 2016).",

Under \u201ccertain environmental conditions,\u201d heavy metals may \u201caccumulate to a highly toxic concentration and cause ecological damage\u201d (Harguinteguy et al. 2014). Once released in aquatic environments, they are generally \u201cbound to particulate matter, which eventually settle down and become incorporated into sediments and are released into the water under the suitable conditions such as pH values and Eh, leading to further contamination of aquatic environment\u201d (Xu and Yang 1996). Accordingly, sediments represent one of the \u201cultimate sinks for heavy metals discharged into aquatic environment\u201d (Gibbs 1973; Bryan and Langston 1992; Harguinteguy et al. 2014). \u201cMore and more attention has been drawn due to the wide spread occurrence of metal pollution in aquatic system\u201d (Zhou et al. 2008). Some \u201cheavy metals\u201d may transform into the \u201cpersistent metallic compounds with high toxicity\u201d (Zhou et al. 2008), which can be \u201cbioaccumulated in the organisms\u201d (Zhou et al. 2008), \u201cmagnified in the food chain, thus threatening human health\u201d (Jin 1992; Zhou et al. 2008). \u201cVarious harmful effects including abnormal development of fetus, procreation failure, and immune deficiency has exhibited due to aquatic metal exposure\u201d (Chang et al. 2000; Zhou et al. 2008). Some heavy metals, including mercury, chromium, cadmium, nickel, copper, and lead, introduced into water systems may pose high toxicities on the aquatic organisms (Wu and Zhao 2006). As an example, \u201ccadmium is a priority environmental contaminant with consequences for human health and the maintenance of bio-diversity in affected ecosystems\u201d (Zhou et al. 2008) and \u201cthe timeliness of a broader, ecosystem-based approach to cadmium research is highlighted based on the overview of recent developments in the field\u201d (Campbell 2006; Zhou et al. 2008).",

            "text": " Eutrophication is a leading cause of destruction of many freshwater and marine ecosystems in the world. It is characterized by \u201cexcessive plant and algal growth due to the increased availability of one or more limiting growth factors needed for photosynthesis\u201d (Schindler 2006), such as sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. \u201cEutrophication occurs naturally over centuries as lakes age and are filled in with sediments\u201d (Carpenter 1981). However, \u201chuman activities have accelerated the rate and extent of eutrophication through both point-source discharges and non-point loadings of limiting nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, into aquatic ecosystems (i.e. cultural eutrophication), with dramatic consequences for drinking water sources, fisheries, and recreational water bodies\u201d (Carpenter et al. 1998; Bhat et al. 2017). However, \u201cduring 1960s and 1970s, scientists linked algal blooms to nutrient enrichment resulting from anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, industry and sewage disposal\u201d (Schindler 1974). The known \u201cconsequences of cultural eutrophication include blooms of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), tainted drinking water supplies, degradation of recreational opportunities and hypoxia\u201d (Bhat et al. 2017). The most obvious effect of cultural eutrophication is the creation of dense blooms of noxious, foul \u201csmelling phytoplankton\u201d that reduce water clarity and \u201charm water quality.\u201d \u201cAlgal blooms limit light penetration, reduce growth and cause death of plants in littoral zones and also lower the success of predators that need light to catch prey\u201d (Lehtiniemi et al. 2005). Furthermore, high rates of photosynthesis associated with eutrophication can deplete dissolved inorganic carbon and raise pH to extreme levels during the day. \u201cElevated pH can in turn \u2018blind\u2019 organisms that rely on perception of dissolved chemical cues for their survival by impairing their chemosensory abilities\u201d (Turner and Chislock 2010). When these \u201cdense algal blooms eventually die, microbial decomposition severely depletes DO, creating a hypoxic dead zone, lacking sufficient oxygen to support most organisms.\u201d Dead zones are found in many \u201cfreshwater lakes including the Laurentian Great Lakes\u201d (e.g., central basin of Lake Erie; Arend et al. 2011) during the summer. Furthermore, such \u201chypoxic events are particularly common in marine coastal environments surrounding large, nutrient-rich rivers\u201d (e.g., Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico; Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay) and have been shown to affect more than 245,000 square kilometers in over 400 near-shore systems (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). \u201c Hypoxia and anoxia as a result of eutrophication continue to threaten profitable commercial and recreational fisheries worldwide. Some algal blooms pose an additional threat because they produce noxious toxins\u201d (e.g., microcystin and anatoxin-a) (Chorus and Bartram 1999). Over the past century, \u201charmful algal blooms (HABs) have been linked with (1) degradation of water quality\u201d (Francis 1878), (2) \u201cdestruction of economically important fisheries\u201d (Burkholder et al. 1992), and (3) \u201cpublic health risks\u201d (Morris 1999). Within freshwater ecosystems, \u201c cyanobacteria are the most important phytoplankton associated with HABs\u201d (Paerl 1988). \u201cToxigenic cyanobacteria, including Anabaena, Cylindrospermopsis, Microcystis, and Oscillatoria (Planktothrix), tend to dominate nutrient-rich, freshwater systems due to their superior competitive abilities under high nutrient concentrations, low nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios, low light levels, reduced mixing, and high temperatures\u201d (Downing et al. 2001; Paerl and Huisman 2009; Paerl and Paul 2012). Poisonings of \u201cdomestic animals, wildlife and even humans by blooms of toxic cyanobacteria\u201d have been recognized throughout the world. Francis (1878) has first observed dead livestock due to \u201calgal bloom of cyanobacteria\u201d (Bhat et al. 2017). Also, cyanobacteria is responsible for several off-flavor compounds (e.g., methylisoborneal and geosmin) found in municipal drinking water systems as well as in aquaculture-raised fishes, resulting in large financial losses for state and regional economies (Crews and Chappell 2007). In addition to posing \u201csignificant public health risks, cyanobacteria have been shown to be poor quality food for most zooplankton grazers in laboratory studies\u201d (Tillmanns et al. 2008; Wilson et al. 2006), thus reducing the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic food webs and potentially preventing zooplankton from controlling algal blooms. Eutrophication is also associated with major changes in aquatic community structure. During \u201ccyanobacterial blooms, small-bodied zooplankton tend to dominate plankton communities, and past observational studies have attributed this pattern to anti-herbivore traits of cyanobacteria\u201d (e.g., toxicity, morphology, and poor food quality) (Porter 1977). However, the biomass of planktivorous fish is often positively related to nutrient levels and ecosystem productivity. Piscivorous fishes (e.g., bass, pike) tend to dominate the fish community of nutrient-poor, oligotrophic lakes, while planktivorous fishes (e.g., shad, bream) become increasingly \u201cdominant with nutrient enrichment\u201d (Jeppesen et al. 1997). Thus, an alternative explanation for the lack of zooplankton control of cyanobacterial blooms could include consumption of zooplankton by planktivores.",

Because of \u201chigh mobility, plastic debris has practically permeated the global marine environment\u201d (Cole et al. 2011; Ivar do sul and Costa 2014), including the \u201cpolar region\u201d (Barnes et al. 2009), \u201cmid-ocean islands\u201d (Ivar do sul et al. 2013), and \u201cthe deep sea\u201d (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013). The sources of marine plastics are not very well characterized. A rough estimation predicts that \u201c70 to 80% of marine litter, most of it is plastics, originate from inland sources and are emitted by rivers to the oceans\u201d (GESAMP 2010). Rivers transport considerable amounts of plastics and \u201cthus contribute significantly to the marine plastics pollution\u201d (Moore et al. 2005; Lechner et al. 2014). \u201cPlastics are dumped in huge volumes in beaches, lakes, navigation channels and other forms of water masses\u201d (Lechner et al. 2014). The volume of plastic is even bigger in low-income countries with poor waste disposal regulations. In the marine environment, \u201cplastics of various size classes and origins are omnipresent and affect numerous species that become entangled in or ingest plastics as well as an aesthetic problem\u201d (Gregory 1999, 2009). \u201cPlastics have been reported as a problem in the marine environment since the 1970s, but only recently the issue of plastic pollution in marine and freshwater environments been identified as a global problem\u201d (Carpenter and Smith 1972). It has been reported that \u201csingle-use plastics (plastic bags and micro beads) are a major source of this pollution\u201d (Desforges et al. 2014; Perkins 2015).",

Another \u201cpotential source is sewage sludge that typically contains more MPs than effluents\u201d (Leslie et al. 2012). A \u201cbroad spectrum of aquatic organisms are prone to MP ingestion ranging from plankton and fish to birds and even mammals, and accumulate throughout the aquatic food web\u201d (Wright et al. 2013). Due to their large \u201csurface-to-volume ratio and chemical composition, MPs accumulate environmental chemicals from the surrounding environment including metals\u201d (Ashton et al. 2010) and \u201cpersistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic compounds\u201d (Koelmans et al. 2013) transferring these contaminants from water to biota. \u201cPlastic particles are also dominated by certain human pathogens like specific members of the genus Vibrio\u201d. Therefore, MPs can act as a vector for waterborne \u201chuman pathogens\u201d influencing the water quality. In addition, \u201cplastics contain and release a multitude of chemical additives\u201d (Rochman 2013; Dekiff et al. 2014) and adsorb organic contaminants from the surrounding media (Bakir et al. 2012). Compounds such as MPs can transfered to organisms upon ingestion (Zarfl and Matthies 2010), this may increase \u201cthe chemical exposure of the ingesting organism and thus, toxicity\u201d (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Teuten et al. 2009).",

The majority of this oil is due to general shipping and industrial activities\u201d (ITOPF 1990). During the Iran\u2013Iraq war (1980\u20131988), approximately 2 million barrels of oil were discharged into the Arabian Gulf sea water. These included \u201c1.5 million barrels from the Nawruz blow-out in 1983\u201d (Watt 1994). Following the \u201cGulf War in 1991, 4 to 8 million barrels of oil were released into the Gulf and the Kuwaiti Desert and, making this the largest oil spill in the history at that time\u201d (Purvis 1999). Previous observations indicated that the number of large \u201coil spills (>700 tons) has decreased significantly over the last 30 years\u201d (ITOPF 1990). During the 1990s, the average number of large oil spills per year was about a third of the amount that was witnessed during the 1970s. It should be noted that \u201c1,133,000 tons of oil was lost in the 1990s and 2000s, during 2010\u20132013, about 22,000 tons of oil was lost\u201d (Levy and Gopalakrishnan 2010; Carriger and Barron 2011). The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill on April 20, 2010, caused the discharge of more than 2.6 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico over just about 3 months. This \u201coil spill was the second largest in human history\u201d (Levy and Gopalakrishnan 2010; Carriger and Barron 2011).

These systems are high-risk because they allow unchecked interactions between the farmed fish and surrounding environment, which leads to \u201cfree exchange of diseases, parasites and fecal matter\u201d (Ali 2006). The recent study has revealed \u201ca parasite transmission of sea lice from captive to wild salmon\u201d (Krkosek et al. 2007). The only barrier between the harvested fish and the wild population is a rigid cage or netting system. When these netting systems are damaged during inclement weather such as snowstorms or hurricanes, it allows \u201cfish to escape from the open systems\u201d (Centre for Food Safety 2012). There were \u201c25 million reported fish escapes worldwide and the majority occurred when netting was damaged during severe weather conditions\u201d (Centre for Food Safety 2012). The escaping of \u201cexotic aquaculture species into the natural ecosystem causes the displacement of native populations, competition for food, space, mates and prey\u201d (Naylor et al. 2005).",
