Type I IFNs signal through a common cellular IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor complex composed of two unique subunits, IFN-\u03b1R1 and IFN-\u03b1R2, which are ubiquitously expressed.12, 15 However, type III IFNs signal through an IFN-\u03bb receptor complex, which consists of a unique IFN-\u03bbR1 chain and a shared IL-10R2 chain, the latter also being the second subunit of the IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26 receptor complexes.1 In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor subunits and the IL-10R2 chain, the IFN-\u03bbR1 chain is expressed primarily by epithelial cells and dendritic cells restricting action of type III IFNs to epithelial cells.13, 14 IL-10 has been shown to have low affinity for the IL-10R2 component of the receptor complex16 and IFN-\u03bb1 is presumed to have low affinity for IL-10R2 as well.",

IFN-\u03bbs have been shown to reduce proliferation of several cancer cell lines such as the colorectal-cancer-derived HCT116 cells,9 glioblastoma LN319 cells,4 and aneuroendocrine BON1 tumor cells.17 In certain esophageal cancer cell lines, it has been found that IFN-\u03bb1 can inhibit their growth through G1 phase arrest and have enhanced antitumor effects in combination with anticancer chemotherapeutics.18 Other agents such as IFN-\u03b3 or the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib can augment the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of IFN-\u03bb in cancer cells.19, 20 With the use of murine tumor models, IFN-\u03bb has been shown to inhibit the growth of MCA205 fibrosarcoma cells in vivo\n21 and retard or suppress the growth of B16 melanoma cells13, 22 and BNL hepatoma cells in mice.23 These studies suggested that investigation of IFN-\u03bb could have benefits not only for treatment of viral diseases such as chronic hepatitis C but also as a cancer chemotherapeutic. Given the more limited expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 throughout the body, it is also likely that use of IFN-\u03bb as a treatment option would be generally tolerated better than treatment with more ubiquitously recognized IFNs, such as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2.",

The known IFN and IL receptor subunits including IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 are structurally related, share a low degree of amino acid similarity in their extracellular domains (with the identity to IL-10R1 ranging from 11% to 13%), and belong to the family of class II cytokine receptors.25, 26\n",

The ligand\u2013receptor interface consists of residues residing on helix A, loop AB, and helix F of IL-10 and on inter-domain loops of IL-10R1, primarily stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. It has been suggested, based on the structure of IL-10 bound to IL-10R1,35 that the receptor-binding site on IL-10 is shared by both IL-10R1 and IL-10R2. EBV IL-10 binds to IL-10R1 with 1000-fold lower affinity than IL-10 due to small changes in both EBV IL-10 positioning on IL-10R1 and inter-helix loops of EBV IL-10.16 In contrast, CMV IL-10 exhibits affinity for IL-10R1 similar to IL-10 but differs in its inter-domain angle by 40\u00b0 as compared to IL-10.36 A model for binding of IL-10 to IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 has been proposed recently based on site-directed mutagenesis experiments,28 updating the previously published model of the ternary IL-10/IL-10R1/IL-10R2 complex.34 In addition, a model for the binding of CMV IL-10 to IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 has been proposed.28\n",

The structures show a 1:1 complex between monomeric IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bbR1, as opposed to the 1:2 complexes seen for IL-10/IL-10R1.

The overall folding of IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bbR1 are similar to other cytokines and cytokine receptors, respectively, and the complex offers hints about how subtle variations between IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 might influence the activity of the cytokines toward HCV.",

The inter-domain angles were measured using C\u03b1 carbon positions of Glu104, Pro30, and His173 of IFN-\u03bbR1, which are equivalent to residues used to define the inter-domain angle of IL-22R1.39 The inter-domain angle is smaller than that reported for IL-22R1 but very similar to the value reported at equivalent positions in IL-10R1.39 Of the 13 loops joining \u03b2-strands, 5 (L3, L5, L7, L9, and L13) participate in the interactions with ligand and are labeled in Fig. 1.

Specifically, the model indicates that interactions occur between IL-22 residues Glu101, Phe105, Asp109, and Gln116 with residues Tyr56, Tyr59, Arg10, and Gln63 from IL-10R2. Few residues corresponding to the IL-22 residues are found in IFN-\u03bb1 when a structural alignment is made, making modeling of a full IFN-\u03bb1/IFN-\u03bbR1/IL-10R2 complex difficult. This also suggests that IFN-\u03bb1 may engage both components of the full receptor complex primarily through association with the high-affinity IFN-\u03bbR1 and that interactions with IL-10R2 may be bridged through interactions between IFN-\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2.",

Second, the binding of IL-10 to its receptor may be influenced by the formation of dimers of IL-10. Given that the dimer of IL-10 is thought to be the functional form of the cytokine, the interaction with IL-10R1 may require a slightly different surface to accommodate IL-10.

Both the ligand and the receptor exhibit topology similar to that of other known cytokines and cytokine receptors, respectively, with a number of subtle variations. The structure of the complex suggests that long-range electrostatic interactions help to orient IFN-\u03bb1 for binding to IFN-\u03bbR1, while hydrophobic and nonpolar interactions solidify the interface between the ligand and the receptor. The structure offers insights into the phenotypes of IFN-\u03bb3 mutations in regard to its antiviral activity and suggests how variances between IFN-\u03bb members influence the differential antiviral activity of these cytokines. However, an experimentally derived structure of the ternary complex that also would include the IL-10R2 receptor molecule is needed for the fuller understanding of the antiviral activity of type III IFNs.",
