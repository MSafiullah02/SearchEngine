Mortality in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) management was very high (Lew et al., 2003).

During the SARS outbreak, tremendous burden was placed on hospitals to provide isolation facilities because of the highly infectious nature of the coronavirus. It would be helpful if some routine laboratory tests could help to stratify patients with compatible clinical features early to allow for efficient use of limited isolation facilities.

This has hampered progress in its diagnosis and effective management. One of the main symptoms of SARS is fever. Fever is also common in other viral infections including dengue which is very common in Asia where the possibility of another SARS outbreak exists. Due to the highly infectious nature of the coronavirus, every febrile patient suspected of SARS screened at the screening centre need to be isolated. This led to a high demand for isolation beds, which is a limited resource in most acute care hospitals, during the SARS outbreak. Furthermore, the more specific serological test only becomes positive late in the course of the disease (Peiris et al., 2003b), whilst RT\u2010PCR for the coronavirus RNA have a detection rate of 79 and 80% in nasopharyngeal aspirate and plasma respectively during the first 3 days of illness (Grant et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2003). Any laboratory features in the first few days of fever that could suggest that the patient is unlikely to have SARS may obviate the need to isolate them in hospital.",

This is comparable with other reported figures of 69.6 and 54% (Booth et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003). The more recent Hong Kong study reported that 98% of their patients have moderate lymphopenia during the course of their illness (Wong et al., 2003). This is comparable with our figure of 81% of patients having moderate lymphopenia by day 10 of illness. One of the notable features in SARS was that reactive lymphocytes were not commonly seen in the peripheral blood film. This contrasts with the common finding of reactive lymphocytes around the fourth and fifth day of fever in dengue which coincided with the recovery of the lymphocyte counts in these patients (Thisyakorn et al., 1984).",

Only 11.6% of our patients had a platelet count < 150 \u00d7 109/l by day 10 of illness. In fact, within the first 5 days of illness, no patients had a platelet count < 80 \u00d7 109/l or a WCC < 2 \u00d7 109/l. By day 10, only two patients had a platelet count < 80 \u00d7 109/l. One of these patients had pre\u2010existing hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis. The source of these differences between our study and the Hong Kong studies is uncertain and may be due to different variants of the coronavirus (Ruan et al., 2003) exerting different effects on the patients or differences in treatment and study design. In contrast to our patients, the Hong Kong patients were routinely treated with prednisolone and ribavarin which may affect platelet and white cell count (Choi et al., 2003). The analysis from Hong Kong included results from patients even after they were admitted to ICU. We only included blood results prior to ICU admission. This made our results more reflective of changes as a result of the coronavirus infection as they are not affected by the treatment given.",

The same applies to patients presenting with a WCC < 2 \u00d7 109/l.
