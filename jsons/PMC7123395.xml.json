However, the United States ignored these warnings. In the early winter of 1950, the American aggressors crossed the 38th parallel and attacked the areas around Yalu River and Tumen River as well as the airspace of Northeast China. Many a Chinese were killed in bomb attacks and property was ruined. As the national security was seriously threatened, the Chinese People\u2019s Volunteer Army entered Korea on October 19, 1950, and began the great war of \u201caiding Korea and defending the homeland.\u201d",

It quickly grew into the largest industrial power in the world. At that time, the US industrial output value accounted for more than half of the total capitalist world industrial output value. US steel production reached 87.72 million tons in 1950; wheat production accounted for more than 30 % of production of the capitalist countries; the industrial and agricultural output value reached 150.7 billion US dollars. In 1949, the US gold reserves were valued at more than 24.7 billion USD, accounting for 70 % of the total gold reserves of the entire capitalist world. In the aggression against Korea, the direct expenses of the war of the United States reached more than 20 billion USD. War material destined for North Korea totaled 73 million tons (Peng Dehuai 1953). In comparison, the nascent PRC from the ruins of wars did not even completely liberate all its territory. Successive wars not only crippled China\u2019s modern industry but also damaged its primitive agriculture. In 1950, New China\u2019s industrial and agricultural output value was only 57.4 billion yuan, less than a fractional amount of that of the United States if converted into US dollars.",

Far from being merely a process of \u201cmedical progress,\u201d the modern system of Western medicine was also a social process in which the technology for social organization and social control continuously improved and intensified. The medical system virtually became the origin of the \u201cmodern political system.\u201d In defining what is \u201chealthy\u201d and what is \u201cunhealthy,\u201d what is hygienic and what is unhygienic, modern medicine also implies political or moral judgments of being \u201csinful\u201d or \u201cdecadent.\u201d More importantly, Foucault believed that the modern medical system, which originated from state behavior, such as controlling the spread of epidemics, was also an \u201caggressive system\u201d full of \u201cwar mentality.\u201d In etiology, all diseases come from the infection of bacteria (microorganisms), to practice medicine is to fight with microbes, and to be a doctor is to be a warrior. Diseases cannot be wiped out without a social system of well-organized, combative doctor-police. That is why the practice of the Western colonial countries or imperialistic countries was discovered to have a close connection with modern hygiene when they were rebuilding the world order. Apartheid was necessary because the colonized people were thought to be the sources of communicable diseases in addition to being cheap labor resources. The metaphor of the \u201cSick Man of East Asia\u201d implied physical and moral denigration to the oppressed state and its people; in addition, the world police system is to prevent, control, and eradicate what was, in their eyes, the physical diseases as well as the social \u201cdiseases\u201d \u2013 resistance, revolts, rebels, etc.6\n",

Organized violence of the state not only became a space construction instrument dividing the borders and establishing boundaries but also played a crucial role in the process of colonization when the original pattern of world trade drastically changed, a new world order and market order were created, and the advantageous position of the Western counties was assured. The premodern agrarian countries were defenseless when confronted with such organized, monopolized, and industrialized state violence. The fiasco of combating the Western countries undermined the sense of superiority and confidence these agricultural countries originally enjoyed. More often than not, they felt hopeless and shameful in being forced to cede their territory and pay indemnities. The frequent attacks of feelings of hopelessness and shamefulness would suppress their original resistance awareness and let them accept the status quo.
