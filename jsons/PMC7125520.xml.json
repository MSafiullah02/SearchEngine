            "text": "Dairy production systems that use cows that have been highly selected for milk production in recent decades have suffered a decline in cow fertility. This has occurred in countries and regions that operate diverse production systems, from continuously calving herds found mostly in the UK and North America to seasonal calving herds found mostly in Ireland, New Zealand and Australia (Lucy, 2001, Dillon et al., 2006, Macdonald et al., 2008). Reproductive efficiency is high priority in all systems yet is considered higher in seasonal calving systems as the opportunity for a cow to calve and become pregnant is time limited to ensure a calf per cow per year in synchrony with grass growth (Dillon et al., 2006). Consequently, one of the greatest challenges of reproductive biologists, nutritionists and geneticists is to gain an understanding of the underlying biology of the dairy cow that contributes to low fertility and develop strategies to improve fertility. Fertility is a multi-factorial trait and its deterioration has been caused by a network of genetic, environmental and managerial factors and their complex interactions make it difficult to determine the exact reason for this decline. Despite this, researchers have identified key causes during the productive life of the dairy cow that negatively impact on her reproductive efficiency. This review focuses on factors in the early post partum period (Fig. 1\n) that affect subsequent fertility during the breeding period and the successful establishment of a viable/sustainable pregnancy within 83 days of calving in 80% of dairy cows (Fig. 2\n).",

            "text": "Over the last 30 years, genetic selection for increased milk production, particularly within the North American Holstein-Friesian genotype, has been very successful. Between 1985 and 2003, the rate of phenotypic gain in milk production per cow per year has been 193 kg for the United States, 131 kg for the Netherlands, 35 kg for New Zealand and 46 kg for Ireland (Dillon et al., 2006). Despite these countries having diverse production systems, genetic selection criteria and climatic conditions, they all report a substantial decline in reproductive performance during the same period. In seasonal pasture based systems of milk production, such as in Ireland and New Zealand, studies have reported conception rates to first service between 39 and 52% (Dillon et al., 2006, Macdonald et al., 2008). In US and UK feedlot systems of milk production, conception rates to first service as low as 30\u201340% have also been reported (Pryce et al., 2004, Norman et al., 2009). In recent years, the emphasis within selection indices for Holstein-Friesians has shifted from predominantly production to functional nonproduction traits associated with improved health and fertility (Miglior et al., 2005). There is now evidence that the phenotypic historical decline in fertility has reached a nadir and begun to improve (Crowe, 2007, Norman et al., 2009); however, future studies are needed to confirm this trend and to determine the alleviating factors. In a recent review (LeBlanc, 2010) readers are urged to critically evaluate studies that have made conclusions on the association between level of milk production and fertility based on incomplete or biased datasets. Other reasons for the decline in fertility such as poor nutrition, management and environmental factors are often not evaluated in these studies although they have a significant impact on reproductive performance. Hence, inappropriate management of high milk producing dairy cows may significantly contribute to the cause of poor fertility rather than direct genetic effects (LeBlanc, 2010).",

            "text": "Understanding genotype by environment interactions is crucial in determining the best health and management practices to achieve high levels of productive and reproductive efficiency. Recent studies have reported higher reproductive performance in high milk producing herds (herd average of >10,000 kg milk production per lactation) than low producing herds and concluded that this was likely due to better nutritional and reproductive management (LeBlanc, 2010). In addition to increases in milk production, increases in herd size, changes in housing conditions and increases in do-it-yourself artificial insemination have all contributed to increased difficulty in managing the high producing dairy cow to achieve high fertility (Rodriguez-Martinez et al., 2008). However, unlike lactating dairy cows, nulliparous dairy heifers with similar genetic merit for milk production have higher conception rates (39% vs 64%, respectively) and this has not decreased during the period of genetic improvement in milk yield (Pryce et al., 2004). Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that demands of high milk production negatively impact a number of physiological pathways to reduce the likelihood of the concomitant establishment of pregnancy and that changes in management practices may go a long way to providing solutions to poor fertility in high producing cows.",

This requirement is only partially met by increased feed consumption (due to limitations in intake and appetite) with the remainder being met by mobilisation of body reserves resulting in animals entering negative energy balance (NEB) (Grummer, 2007). The consequences of severe NEB are an increased risk of metabolic diseases (see below), that largely occur within the first month of lactation, reduced immune function and a reduction in subsequent fertility (Roche et al., 2009).",

It has been correlated with reproductive performance, both phenotypically (Buckley et al., 2003b) and genetically (Berry et al., 2003a) and supports the premise that nutritional status affects reproductive function. Cows in low BCS at calving, or that suffer excess BCS loss early postpartum, are less likely to ovulate, have a reduced submission rate to artificial insemination, conception rate to first service, 6-week in-calf rate and also have an increased likelihood for pregnancy loss and increased calving to conception interval (Berry et al., 2007, Roche et al., 2009). This can partly be attributed to impaired oocyte competence associated with a low BCS (1.5\u20132.5; 5-point scale) (Snijders et al., 2000). Fertility in cows that are over conditioned at calving (BCS \u2265 3.5; 5-point scale) is also compromised as they have reduced dry matter intake (DMI) just prior to calving, take longer to increase DMI postpartum, tend to have greater fat mobilisation and therefore a more severe NEB early postpartum than cows with an optimum BCS at calving (Roche et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Heat stress can further exacerbate the effects of NEB. During periods of heat stress, lactating cows have a reduced appetite and higher BCS loss early postpartum compared to non heat stressed cows (Shehab-El-Deen et al., 2010). Furthermore, concentrations of glucose, IGF-I and cholesterol are lower, while concentrations of NEFA and urea are higher in blood and follicular fluid of heat stressed animals (Shehab-El-Deen et al., 2010). These changes, along with a decrease in dominant follicle diameter, and coupled with a more severe NEB in heat stressed cows make achieving high reproductive efficiency in subtropical and tropical climates a greater challenge. Thus, this highlights the importance of monitoring body condition score pre- and postpartum as an aid to nutritional and management decisions in order to ensure a mild, but not severe NEB occurs early postpartum and to minimise its carry-over effects into the remainder of the lactation (Roche, 2006, Chagas et al., 2007). It is also important to note that partitioning of nutrients is under genetic control; hence different nutritional and management strategies are required for individual animals. Recent reviews (Chagas et al., 2007, Thatcher et al., 2010) have expanded on different nutritional strategies to optimise BCS at critical stages of the productive life of the dairy cow and should be referred to for a more comprehensive analysis.",

Thus cows enter a period of NEB characterised by marked changes in endocrine, metabolic and physiological status. This time period is also associated with increased oxidative stress in the dairy cow and this, coupled with the aforementioned stressors, may play a role in compromising the immune and inflammatory response of the cow to these changes (Sordillo and Aitken, 2009). Immunocompromised dairy cows are at risk of developing metabolic disorders, which include acidosis, fatty liver disease, retained placenta and displaced abomasums (Roche, 2006, Mulligan and Doherty, 2008). Metabolic disorders, caused by a mismatch between macromineral requirements and availability in the diet such as clinical hypocalcaemia (milk fever), hypomagnesaemia and ketosis can further exacerbate the degree of immunocompromisation experienced in early lactation (Mulligan and Doherty, 2008). Cows that suffer from metabolic disorders in the peri parturient period are more likely to have increased incidence of mastitis, lameness and endometritis (Roche, 2006) all of which contribute to reduced reproductive efficiency (see below). Furthermore, these production diseases cause serious economic loss to the dairy industry and also have animal welfare implications (Ouweltjes et al., 1996, Ahmadzadeh et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The onset of lactation is associated with an increase in growth hormone that drives nutrient partitioning (mainly in the liver and adipose) that supports milk production (Lucy, 2008). Due to NEB, insulin concentrations remain low which prevents an increase in liver growth hormone receptors and IGF-I secretion causing the somatotropic axis to be uncoupled (Lucy, 2008). This negatively impacts reproduction as insulin and IGF-I are unable to synergise with the gonadotrophins on ovarian cells preventing the dominant follicle from ovulating (Beam and Butler, 1999) and delaying the resumption of cyclicity (Gutierrez et al., 1999). Conversely, cows that have greater plasma IGF-I concentrations during the first 2 weeks postpartum have an increased likelihood of a shorter calving to commencement of luteal activity (Patton et al., 2007). Similarly, the percent of cows ovulating within 50 days postpartum increased from 55 to 90% in cows fed a high starch diet that promoted greater insulin release in response to feeding (Gong et al., 2002). While an insulin promoting diet has the potential to hasten the onset of cyclicity after calving there is some evidence that maintaining cows on such a diet may have deleterious effects on embryo survival rates (Fouladi-Nashta et al., 2005). However, it has been suggested that this may be overcome by adopting a sequential feeding system whereby a glucogenic diet is offered early postpartum to enhance follicle development and resumption of ovarian cycles and a lipogenic diet is offered during the breeding season to increase availability of fatty acids which has beneficial effects on oocyte quality and embryo development (Garnsworthy et al., 2009). As lactation progresses, the somatotropic axis becomes recoupled due to greater nutrient intake and improved energy balance resulting in increased insulin concentrations, expression of growth hormone receptors in the liver and finally liver production of IGF-I (Lucy, 2008).",

The incidence of mastitis within the first 30 days postpartum is reported to be 23% (Zwald et al., 2004). A positive genetic correlation between mastitis and milk yield (range 0.15\u20130.68) has been reported (Ingvartsen et al., 2003) and consequently high yielding cows have an increased risk of developing mastitis. The effect of mastitis, particularly mastitis caused by gram-negative pathogens, on reproductive function has only recently been highlighted. Cows that experienced clinical mastitis (diagnosed when visible abnormalities in milk were observed) in the first 28 days after calving had delayed onset of oestrous behaviour (91 days) compared to their healthy herdmates (84 days) (Huszenicza et al., 2005). Cows with clinical mastitis required more services per conception compared to their healthy herdmates (2.1 vs. 1.6, respectively) and had longer days empty (140 vs. 80, respectively) (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2009). Moreover, the number of days to first AI was greater in cows where clinical mastitis occurred before first AI (93.6 days) than if it occurred between first AI and pregnancy or after 50\u201360 days after first AI (71 days) (Barker et al., 1998). Furthermore, cows that had a clinical mastitis case between AI and within 50 days of pregnancy had lower conception rates and were 2.80 times more likely to suffer late embryonic loss compared to cows with no symptoms of mastitis (Chebel et al., 2004, Santos et al., 2004). Additionally increased embryonic loss has been reported in cows that developed clinical mastitis after 50 days of pregnancy (Santos et al., 2004). These studies indicate that clinical mastitis in the early postpartum period had a profound effect on reproductive success.",

Melendez et al. (2003) proposed three hypotheses for the negative effect of lameness on fertility based on reviews of the literature and findings from his research group. Firstly, histamine and endotoxins released during the decline of ruminal pH in animals suffering rumen acidosis act indirectly to destroy the microvasculature of the corium causing laminitis. These substances can also potentiate their affects at the neuroendocrine and ovarian level and compromise the LH surge system (Nocek, 1997). Secondly, stress induced hormones may alter the GnRH and/or LH surge system. Finally, the degree of NEB may be greater in lame cows and hence affect the somatotropic axis (Melendez et al., 2003).",

However, in seasonal grass based production systems, the incidence of anovulatory anoestrus can range between 13 and 48% prior to the start of the breeding season while in year-round non-grazing dairy production systems the incidence of anoestrus can range between 11 and 38% 60 days or more after calving (Rhodes et al., 2003). This wide variation can be attributed to differences in feed quality, composition, availability and also definitional differences. Up to 50% of modern dairy cows have abnormal oestrous cycles postpartum resulting in increased calving to first insemination intervals (Opsomer et al., 1998) and decreased conception rates (Garnsworthy et al., 2009).",

Primiparous cows had more days to first ovulation (31.8 \u00b1 8.3 days) than multiparous cows (17.3 \u00b1 6.3 days) (Tanaka et al., 2008). Additionally, primiparous cows have energetic demands for growth as well as lactation and may be in greater NEB than multiparous cows (Lucy, 2001). Other risk factors cited for delayed resumption of cyclicity include periparturient disorders, season of calving, management, mastitis, lameness and severe BCS loss (Crowe, 2008, Garnsworthy et al., 2008). In mastitic and lame cows, a delay in the resumption of cyclicity could add an extra 7 and 17 days, respectively to the calving to conception interval (Dobson et al., 2008). Compared to their healthy herdmates, cows with clinical endometritis were 4.5 times more likely to have delayed resumption of ovarian cyclicity and 4.4 times more likely to have prolonged postpartum luteal phases (Opsomer et al., 2000). Endometrial epithelial cells respond to uterine infection by altering the secretion and thereby function of prostaglandins from luteolytic (prostaglandin F2\u03b1) to luteotropic (prostaglandin E2) action. This mechanism has been proposed to explain delayed resumption of cyclicity in infected cows (Peter et al., 2009, Sheldon et al., 2009b).",

Coupled with poor expression, an inability to easily detect oestrus further hinders insemination at the correct time. Different methods of oestrus detection yield different detection efficiencies (Roelofs et al., 2010). Based on visual observation for standing heat and use of tail paint as an aid to detection an average oestrus detection rate of 70% has been reported with individual herd rates ranging from 25 to 96% (Mee et al., 2002). Studies that investigated oestrus detection rates using pedometers reported efficiencies between 80 and 100% (Roelofs et al., 2010). Risk factors for poor expression of oestrus are classified as either cow or environmental factors where cow factors include silent or anovulatory anoestrus, parity, milk production and health, and environmental factors include nutrition, housing, season and number of herd mates in oestrus simultaneously (Roelofs et al., 2010).",

            "text": "In modern dairy producing systems, the incidence of lameness can range from 2 to 20% (Bergsten, 2001) and most frequently occurs in the first 60\u201390 days of lactation (Rowlands et al., 1985). Following normal resumption of cyclicity after calving, lameness has no effect on the observation of oestrus but does lower the intensity of expression of oestrus, decreases locomotion and isolation from the sexually active group (Walker et al., 2008). In tie stall compared to free stall housing, overt signs of oestrus are reduced in cows. Furthermore, compared to free stall housing, cows on pasture exhibited less mounts per hour during oestrus (11.2 vs 5.4 mounts, respectively) and is partly explained because cows spend more time grazing than cows in confined housing. A reduced duration of oestrus behaviour was also observed in cows that were housed on concrete surface compared to those that had access to both concrete and exercise yard (approximately 5.5 vs 1.3 h, respectively). The reader is referred to a recent review for a more comprehensive look at the factors that disrupt on oestrus (Roelofs et al., 2010).",

            "text": "A number of physiological events also affect the expression of oestrus. Firstly, high producing dairy cows (\u226539.5 kg/day) have shorter oestrus (6.2 h vs 10.9 h), less total standing time (21.7 s vs 28.2 s) and lower serum oestradiol concentrations (6.8 pg/ml vs 8.6 pg/ml) compared to lower producing dairy cows (<39.5 kg/day) (Lopez et al., 2004). One hypothesis explaining the reduced oestradiol concentrations in high producing dairy cows is an increased metabolic clearance rate of oestradiol (Sangsritavong et al., 2002) due to the higher dry matter intakes in high producing dairy cows. In support of this, nulliparous heifers have higher circulating concentrations of oestradiol around the time of oestrus (Sartori et al., 2004, Wolfenson et al., 2004) and this may account for the longer duration of oestrus (11.3 \u00b1 6.9 h) and longer standing oestruses (16.8 \u00b1 12.8) observed in nulliparous heifers when compared to multiparous cows (Nebel et al., 1997). Secondly, NEB has been linked to decreased pulsatile LH secretion and IGF-I concentrations (Diskin et al., 2003). Both LH and IGF-I act synergistically to promote follicular development (Lucy, 2000) therefore follicular competence is compromised in these animals which leads to lower oestradiol concentrations resulting in poorer expression of oestrus. Finally, stressors such as lameness and mastitis reduce GnRH and hence LH pulse frequency, leading to short term decreases in follicular oestradiol production as well as delaying and reducing the magnitude of the LH surge (Dobson et al., 2007a). Heat stressed animals (tropical and subtropical regions) also experience an increased incidence of anoestrus and silent ovulation (De Rensis and Scaramuzzi, 2003). Ovulation failure after insemination to a given oestrus can range between 6 and 16% (L\u00f3pez-Gatius et al., 2005, Demetrio et al., 2007) and is 3.9 times more likely to occur during high (>25 \u00b0C) ambient temperatures (L\u00f3pez-Gatius et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Fertilisation rates in the 1980s in Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were greater than 95%; however, in a recent review of the literature, it was estimated that this figure has declined to 83% (Sartori et al., 2010). In contrast, fertilisation rates in heifers have remained consistently high at and greater than 90% (Diskin and Morris, 2008, Sartori et al., 2010). What are the reasons for high fertilisation failure observed in high producing dairy cows? Factors such as heat stress, oocyte quality and sperm characteristics have received some attention and are expanded upon here. High ambient temperatures can have a deleterious effect on fertilisation success. Heat stress between 50 and 20 days prior to AI has been associated with a reduction in oocyte quality and early embryo development (Roth et al., 2001b). Similarly, cows exposed to heat stress prior to AI were 31\u201333% less likely to conceive than those not exposed to heat stress (Chebel et al., 2004). Similar fertilisation rates between lactating and non-lactating cows have been observed (87.8 and 89.5%, respectively) during the cool season; however, lactating dairy cows had lower fertilisation rates than heifers during high ambient temperatures (55.6 and 100%, respectively) (Sartori et al., 2010). These findings indicate that in addition to heat stress, physiological status (lactating and non-lactating) can significantly compromise fertilisation success. As previously mentioned in Section 3.1, the effects of heat stress on oocyte quality are likely a consequence of altered biochemical composition in follicular fluid (lower glucose, IGF-I and cholesterol and higher NEFA and urea) observed in lactating dairy cows during summer compared to winter months (Shehab-El-Deen et al., 2010). These findings support the hypothesis that exposure of ovarian oocytes to unfavourable physiological events during follicle development from primordial to pre-ovulatory stage may result in the ovulation of defective oocytes up to 3 months after the insult (Britt, 1992, Fair, 2010). Therefore, early postpartum disorders such as NEB, abnormal gonadotropin secretion, uterine infection and other disorders discussed earlier could have subsequent deleterious effects on oocyte development and competence.",

            "text": "The causes of very early embryo mortality focus on the early embryos inability to develop as a consequence of poor oocyte quality or an inadequate uterine environment. As mentioned earlier, several studies have reported factors that act directly or indirectly on oocyte quality with consequential effects on embryo development after fertilisation. There is general agreement that in vitro embryo development (to day 7) of oocytes from cows with high-genetic merit for milk production is inferior compared to oocytes from cows of medium-genetic merit, irrespective of actual milk production (Snijders et al., 2000). Furthermore, physiological status (lactating or non-lactating) has a significant effect on embryo quality. Embryos recovered at day 7 from non-lactating Holstein-Friesian heifers and beef heifers were of higher quality compared to lactating Holstein-Friesian cows (Leroy et al., 2005). Higher quality embryos were also recovered at day 5 from non-lactating Holstein-Friesian heifers compared to lactating Holstein-Friesian cows (Sartori et al., 2010). The very early embryo remains in the oviduct for 4\u20135 days after ovulation before travelling into the uterus. The oviduct provides nutrients (e.g. ions, amino acids and glucose) and local growth factors (e.g. IGF-I and IGF-II) to the developing zygote (Robinson et al., 2008) that can be modified by maternal nutrition (McGuire et al., 1992) (Pushpakumara et al., 2002), energy balance (Fenwick et al., 2008) and lactation. These studies implicate the IGF signalling pathway within the oviduct as perturbing early embryo development in lactating cows but it should also be noted that disrupting the mechanism of oviductal muscular and ciliary movement for sperm and oocyte transport may present the embryo at the wrong stage of development (too early or too late) to the uterus resulting in early embryo mortality (Wiebold, 1988).",

In a recent study using a state of-the-art endoscopic transfer technique, 1800 in vitro-produced embryos were transferred (on day 2 of the cycle) to the oviducts of nulliparous Holstein-Friesian heifers and postpartum lactating Holstein-Friesian cows at approximately 60 days postpartum and recovered five days after transfer (Rizos et al., 2010). The recovery rate was significantly higher in heifers (80%) than cows (57%) and, of the embryos recovered, 34% had developed to the blastocyst stage in heifers compared with 18% in lactating cows. This suggests that the reproductive tract of the lactating dairy cow provides a less favourable environment for very early embryo development than that of the heifer.",

While interest has mostly been on luteal phase maternal progesterone concentrations after day 7 new information on concentrations before day 7 is now emerging. Animals that have an earlier increase in progesterone concentrations between days 4 and 7 after insemination (i.e. greater concentrations during this period) have a greater chance of maintaining a pregnancy than animals with a slower rise (Diskin and Morris, 2008). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that a five-fold increase in systemic progesterone concentrations early post conception was associated with an increase in embryo size on days 13 and 16 of pregnancy (Carter et al., 2008). Furthermore, a delay in the post-ovulatory rise of progesterone has been associated with decreased pregnancy rate both in cows and in heifers (Diskin and Morris, 2008). The present thinking is that progesterone has limited or no direct effect on the embryo (Clemente et al., 2009) but that an early rise in progesterone alters endometrial secretions (the histotroph) that stimulate embryo development after day 7 leading to a large conceptus that is better able to signal maternal recognition of pregnancy.",

This is more easily achieved by a larger than a smaller embryo. Early embryo loss due to the failure of maternal recognition of pregnancy is thought to account for up to 25% of failures of conception in dairy cows (Sreenan and Diskin, 1983).

Inbreeding also contributes to a higher incidence of dystocia and stillbirth while crossbreeding can be used as a tool to alleviate its effects (Berglund, 2008). Twin calving events also increase the risk of perinatal mortality; one or both calves are reported as dead in 28.2% of twin calving events compared with 7.2% in single births.

We now prioritise a number of these for improvement and summarise them in Fig. 3\n. The first consideration is of NEB that leads to many negative outcomes and is a major factor contributing to the pathogenesis of infertility. In addition recovery from uterine inflammation and infection after parturition are critical for the uterus to provide a favourable environment for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Therefore, future strategies to improve fertility focusing on the early postpartum period should be based upon minimising the duration and degree of NEB and resolving uterine infection. On day 0 of the cycle (and pregnancy) detection of oestrus and insemination at the correct time relative to ovulation is paramount and needs to be followed by ovulation and fertilisation of a high quality oocyte (day 1). Once this has been achieved an early rise in progesterone concentrations (between days 3 and 7) is required to alter uterine endometrial secretions that stimulate embryo development (days 6\u201313) leading to a large embryo that produces adequate quantities of interferon tau (days 14\u201318) to alter uterine prostaglandin secretion and to signal maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 16\u201318) to the dam. The reductionist approach has investigated many of these issues in isolation; however, a holistic approach is now needed and future efforts to improve fertility in dairy cows needs to focus on genetic and management solutions to improve the physiological events associated with the establishment of pregnancy.",
