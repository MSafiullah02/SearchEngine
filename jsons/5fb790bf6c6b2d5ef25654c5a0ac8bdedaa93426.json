            "text": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia is defined as pneumonia in patients treated by mechanical ventilation, occurring 48 hr after intubation. Ventilatorassociated pneumonia is the most common hospital acquired infection in intensive care patients, occurring in 9-27% of intubated patients [Chastre and Fagon, 2002; Rello et al., 2002] . Ventilator-associated pneumonia is associated with a high mortality, ranging from 20% to 70%, depending on the microorganism involved [Chastre and Fagon, 2002] . Apart from the high mortality associated with ventilatorassociated pneumonia, it has been demonstrated that ventilator-associated pneumonia prolongs both the duration of mechanical ventilation and the stay in the intensive care unit [Chastre and Fagon, 2002; Rello et al., 2002] . Ventilator-associated pneumonia can be caused by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus [Chastre and Fagon, 2002] . However, using criteria described previously [Baselski, 1993; Allaouchiche et al., 1996] , approximately 30-40% of patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia have a bacterial ventilator-associated pneumonia which is confirmed microbiologically. Often, the cause of infection is not found in the remaining 60-70% of patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. In recent years, viruses have been suggested as the cause of respiratory infections in non-immunocompromised critically ill patients.",

Other amoeba-associated microorganisms, such as Legionella pneumophila, are known to cause pneumonia in different patient groups. Various studies have suggested the possible pathogenicity of APMV. Seroconversion to APMV was shown in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [La Scola et al., 2005] or nosocomial pneumonia [Berger et al., 2006] . In these studies, antibodies against APMV were found in respectively 9.7% and 7.1% of the patients included. In addition, in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, positive serology for APMV was associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the intensive care unit [Vincent et al., 2009] . The virus itself was found only in one patient in one particular study [La Scola et al., 2005] . Because of the potential role of APMV as a respiratory pathogen and the significant proportion of patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia without a causative microorganism found, the aim of the present study was to assess the presence of APMV in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of critically ill patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia by real-time PCR (RT-PCR).",

Purified DNA was resuspended in a final volume of 120 ml. Each sample was spiked with a control plasmid (murine cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B gene [mCMV-gb]) [Vliegen et al., 2004] before DNA isolation as an isolation and amplification control. An in-house PCR was performed using primers and probes, designed with the Primer3 software, which target the Mimi L396 VV A18 helicase gene (Table I) . Assays were performed in a 96well Optical Reaction plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a total volume of 50 ml which contained 0.3 mM forward primer, 0.3 mM reverse primer, 0.1 mM probe, 25 ml ABsolute QPCR Mastermix (ABgene, Epsom, UK), and 10 ml DNA. The PCR reactions for the isolation and amplification control (mCMV-gb) were carried out using primers and a probe described previously [Vliegen et al., 2004] . The PCR thermal profile for both APMV and mCMV-ie consisted of an initial incubation of 15 min at 95\u02daC followed by a total of 43 cycles of amplification (15 sec at 95\u02daC and 1 min at 60\u02daC). Amplification was performed using the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System and data were interpreted using the ABI Prism SDS software. A positive control containing APMV was supplied by professor D. Raoult . This positive control was included during each PCR run.",

Since the virus is able to induce pneumonia in mice, it was hypothesized that it would also be able to induce pneumonia in humans. Several studies have been conducted to detect APMV DNA in different patient groups [Larcher et al., 2006; Dare et al., 2008] . Until now, evidence of APMV as a respiratory pathogen has been based mainly on serologic studies. La Scola et al. [2005] performed a study in Canada showing the presence of antibodies to APMV in 9.7% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Berger et al. [2006] collected blood samples from all patients admitted to the intensive care unit suspected clinically of pneumonia. A total of 210 episodes of pneumonia were included. Antibodies against APMV were detected in 7.1% of these patients. Another study performed on an intensive care unit determined the APMV sero-status of the admitted patients [Vincent et al., 2009] . All patients with a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia were sampled. Acute and covalescent-phase serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies against APMV by an immunofluorescence assay. A total of 19.7% of the intensive care unit patients with a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia were sero-positive for APMV. Furthermore, seropositivity for APMV was associated with an increased duration of both mechanical ventilation and stay at the intensive care unit. All these studies show a possible role for APMV in respiratory infections. However, the presence of antibodies against APMV does not prove an active infection caused by the virus. In order to establish a causal link between APMV and pulmonary infections the criteria described in an article by Robinson [1958] could be used. These specific criteria are based on Koch's postulates but adapted to fit (the majority of) viruses. These criteria state that the virus should be present in respiratory specimens of a significant percentage of patients with a suspicion of the infection and should be absent in the majority of healthy people.",

The results of the present study are in line with two previous studies. APMV DNA could not be detected in neither patients with community-acquired pneumonia nor in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia in nasal and nasopharyngeal aspirates of nine different patient-groups consisting of 496 patients [Dare et al., 2008] . The patients included in the present study were all critically ill patients with a suspicion of ventilatorassociated pneumonia opposed to the study performed by Dare et al. [2008] consequently, the patient-groups may not be fully comparable. The patient material on which the PCR was performed also differed; the present study only used bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples, whilst the PCR in the study of Dare et al. [2008] was conducted on nasal and nasopharyngeal aspirates. In a study conducted by Larcher et al. [2006] , a total of 214 nasopharyngeal aspirates from children, hospitalized for respiratory tract infections, were tested for the presence of different respiratory viruses, including APMV. APMV could not be detected in any of the respiratory samples tested by APMV-specific PCR. Only one study currently describes a patient in whom APMV DNA was detected in a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. La Scola et al. [2005] performed a study in a Canadian population consisting of 376 patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and 511 healthy controls. The patient in whom APMV was detected was a 60-year-old critically ill patient who had two episodes of hospital-acquired pneumonia during hospitalization. APMV DNA was only detected in the sample from the second episode; unfortunately no serum was tested for the presence of antibodies against APMV in this patient. Since APMV was only detected during the second episode of suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia it suggests it was acquired during hospitalization, probably through water present on the intensive care unit. Since APMV has only been isolated once in a single patients with a clinical respiratory infection [La Scola et al., 2005] , APMV might not be a major cause of respiratory infections in intensive care patients.",

Since the discovery and description of the first AMPV strain, many other APMV-related viruses have been de-tected. The probe used in the present study matches with both AMPV and mamavirus, but not with other closely related viruses of the Mimivirus family. Therefore, the patient in the present study could be positive for other viruses of the Mimivirus family. Since the viruses of the Mimivirus family are prone to polymorphisms at the nucleotide level, designing a universal PCR model, with a high sensitivity, for the complete Mimivirus family is difficult. One of the limitations of the present study was the lacking of serology results of the patients. Therefore, the extent of exposure of the studied patients to APMV is yet to be unraveled. Likewise, to the authors' best knowledge the seroprevalence of antibodies against APMV in the general Dutch population is also not known, making it impossible to predict the population at risk for a possible APMV infection. Another limitation might be the retrospective nature of the study. Due to the duration of the study, all bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were stored and frozen, some of them for a long time. This might have altered the composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. A third limitation of the study is the amount of excluded bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. Due to the amount of other test already performed on the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples for diagnostic and research purposes, a proportion of samples did not contain enough material to perform the DNA extraction for APMV correctly.",
