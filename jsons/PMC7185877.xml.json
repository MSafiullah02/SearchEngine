His experiments led him to conclude that the immune system is normally focused on responding to foreign materials; it has an inherent tendency to avoid attacking self tissues. Nevertheless, when this process goes wrong, the immune system can attack self tissues, resulting in autoimmune disease (Bell and Bird, 2005). Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (MS), can create life-long disability and increased mortality.",

            "text": "Even in 2008, we do not completely understand the primary initiators or causes of many of these autoimmune diseases. No single theory or mechanism can adequately explain all features or pathogeneses of autoimmune diseases. The clinically wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases is best considered as the mosaic of autoimmunity. The many factors involved are genetic, hormonal, immunological, and environmental (Deodhar, 1992). In particular, virus infections have long been associated with autoimmune diseases, whether MS, diabetes, or myocarditis (Fujinami, 2004, Fujinami et al., 2006, Horwitz and Sarvetnick, 1999, von Herrath and Oldstone, 1996). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain virus triggers of autoimmune diseases. One mechanism is \u201cmolecular mimicry\u201d (Fujinami, 2001, Fujinami et al., 2006, Libbey and Fujinami, 2002), which represents a shared immunologic epitope with a microbe and the host. For example, molecular mimicry has been assigned a presumptive role in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type-1 (IDDM), ankylosing spondylitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and MS (Fujinami, 2001, Horwitz and Sarvetnick, 1999, Janewa et al., 2004). The immune response to the virus cross-reacts with self because of molecular mimicry, which engenders autoimmunity as follows (Fujinami et al., 2006); virus-infected-antigen presenting cells (APCs) present viral peptides in the contexts of MHC class I and II, respectively, to naive CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells. Activation of T cells engenders IFN-\u03b3 production, which further activates APCs, leading to production of IL-12, a potent T-cell-differentiating cytokine. Effector CD4+ T cells release proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, thereby stimulating T cells to differentiate into effector T cells. Activated T cells can also secrete IFN-\u03b3 and TNF, which can engender macrophage activation. The activated macrophages in turn release TNF, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen intermediates, which can kill infected cells and uninfected cells. Dead and dying cells are then phagocytosed by macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which can present self antigens to autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Similarly, effector CD8+ T cells can kill infected cells via perforin and granzyme granules. Cell debris is taken up by APCs, which can present self antigens to autoreactive CD8+ T cells. The generation of such cells can engender autoimmune responses with enhanced inflammation if not modulated by regulatory T cells releasing IL-10 and/or TGF-\u03b3. Consequently, patients can develop autoimmune disease through virus-induced autoimmunity.",

Possible mechanisms of protecting against autoimmune disease are considered as \u201caltered peptide ligand\u201d, which activates regulatory cells that modulate the disease (Barnett et al., 1996, Fujinami et al., 2006), and \u201cactivation-induced cell death\u201d (AICD) which engenders anergy or unresponsiveness of T cells (Fujinami, 2001). These imply that viruses having molecular mimicry with self proteins are useful to vaccinate against autoimmune disease. Using molecular biology and DNA manipulation methods, it has also been possible to express mimic proteins in adequate live vectors (Arnon and Ben-Yedidia, 2003) and thereby design transgenic vector vaccines (Janewa et al., 2004, Roitt et al., 1998) against autoimmune disease. The development of vaccines has been an important contribution of autoimmune disease therapy and public health.",

            "text": "The breaking of tolerance or unresponsiveness to self antigens, involving the activation of autoreactive lymphocytes, is a critical event in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease (von Herrath and Oldstone, 1996). The molecular mimicry theory has become an important paradigm to explain the triggering of autoaggressive T lymphocytes (Anderton, 2006). Viruses and microbial agents might possess protein structures or shapes that mimic normal host self proteins. An immune response elicited against the pathogen will eliminate it and will cross-react with one or more self antigens that share determinants with the agent (von Herrath and Oldstone, 1996). The cross-reactive immune response can break a tolerance for self antigens and might engender autoimmune disease. We consider a viral infection that can induce cross-reactive immune responses with a self antigen caused by molecular mimicry (see Fig. 1\n). To explore effects of the viral infection and dynamical behavior of the vicious cycle of autoimmunity, we propose the following mathematical model based on the autoimmune disease model proposed in Iwami et al. (2007a) and Iwami (2007);T\u2032=g(T)-\u03b2^1TI,D\u2032=\u03b2^1TI-\u03b1D,I\u2032=f(D,V)-\u03b3I,V\u2032=(k-u-\u03b22I)V.Variables T, D, I, and V, respectively, signify the number of target (uninfected) cells, damaged cells (which implies a concentration of self antigen), cross-reactive immune cells, and viral agents with molecular mimicry. The immune responses eliminate target cells and viral agents at a rate of \u03b2^1 and \u03b22, respectively. We assume a \u201cMalthusian growth rate\u201d k in viral agents, which decay at a rate u as considered in Nowak et al. (1991). The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b3 represent the decay rate of damaged and cross-reactive immune cells, respectively. The function g(T) is the \u201ctarget cell growth function\u201d. In Iwami et al. (2007a), we consider two target cell growth functions g1(T)=\u03bb-\u03bcT, which means a constant growth and g2(T)=\u03bb-\u03bcT+pT(1-T/L) which means a logistic growth. A form of this function considerably affects the dynamics of autoimmune disease (Iwami et al., 2007a, Iwami, 2007). However, to examine the effect of viral infection with molecular mimicry specifically, we consider that target cells are always constant T=T* (we omit target cell dynamics). This assumption is justified by some homeostatic ability of organs, which exactly balances the growth of target cells with the damage. A modeling approach of this kind is used in Nowak and May (1994). On the other hand, the assumption is not biologically unnatural if the target cells are abundant in the organ. We leave the inclusion of target cell dynamics as a subject for future work. We can model the vicious cycle in the following form:(1)D\u2032=\u03b21I-\u03b1D,I\u2032=f(D,V)-\u03b3I,V\u2032=(k-u-\u03b22I)V,where \u03b21=\u03b2^1T*. Therein, \u03b21 and \u03b22, respectively, represent a degree of affinity to self and viral antigens (non-self antigen). A property of molecular mimicry can be described using these parameters. The function f(D,V) is the \u201cimmune response function\u201d (see Iwami et al., 2007a). In general, the proliferation ability is saturated for a sufficiently large amount of antigens (Borghans and de Boer, 1995, Borghans et al., 1998, De Boer and Perelson, 1995). We consider that the proliferation of immune response is dependent on the total number of self and viral antigens as f1(D,V)=m(D+V)h+D+V,f2(D,V)=m(D+V)2h2+(D+V)2.The forms of f1 and f2 can be regarded, respectively, as functional responses of Holling types II and III. Parameters m and h, respectively, signify the maximum proliferation rate and the efficiency of the proliferation.",

First we assume that autoimmune disease has already developed before the patient is infected with the virus having molecular mimicry with self proteins (V(0)=0). In model (2), we assume that Ea is stable (\u03b21>\u03b1\u03b3h/m) with V(0)=0, which corresponds to Fig. 2(c), irrespective of the sign of k-u (we remark that the infection with k-u>0 persists and initiates autoimmune disease even if \u03b21<\u03b1\u03b3h/m). Furthermore, to avoid the obvious result, we assume that the immune affinity with viral antigen is high (\u03b22>\u03b3(k-u)/m). Actually, if the affinity with viral antigen is low (\u03b22<\u03b3(k-u)/m), then the viral population explodes (see Appendix C) and the number of damaged cells (D\u221e) represents its maximum value, which implies that the viral infection detrimental affects the patients. We also exclude the high affinity with self antigen (\u03b21>H(\u03b22)) because the viral infection cannot affect the disease progression. Consequently, we assume the following conditions: k-u>0,\u03b1\u03b3hm<\u03b21<H(\u03b22),\u03b22>\u03b3(k-u)m.We evaluate the effect of viral infection as follows. Let V(0)>0; then the stable equilibrium changes from Ea to Ec (the patients get the viral infection). We then have the following relations: \u03b21<H(\u03b22)\u21d2Da<Dc,Ia<Ic.They imply that the viral infection always imparts a detrimental effect on patients and accelerates autoimmune disease on the region because the viral infection increases damaged cells (Da<Dc) and cross-reactive immune responses (Ia<Ic) (see Fig. 6\n).",

After emergence of autoimmunity, the vector vaccine can reproduce itself, induce a cross-reactive immune response, and be removed by the immune response in patients as a similar mechanism for viral infection with molecular mimicry (see Fig. 7\n). Therefore, we can consider that the vaccine can be described similarly as the viral infection in terms of the mathematical model. Fujinami (2001) and Fujinami et al. (2006), explained that a possible mechanism of protection from EAE by the viral infection might be suppression of autoreactive immune cells caused by regulatory cells, AICD, and so on. However, our results demonstrate that a viral infection in model (3) can be effective for autoimmune disease without involving these suppressive effects. This shows that, when the immune response function is f2, the vector vaccine can reduce the cross-reactive immune response (Ia+>Ic*) and relieve symptoms of autoimmune disease (Da+>Dc*), which implies that the vector vaccine can be effective by itself even if we consider no additional suppressive abilities in our immune system.",

The affinities with self and non-self antigen are in the beneficial region, as shown in Fig. 6. Actually, our immune system has high affinity with non-self antigen and low affinity with self antigen because, in the process of differentiation thymic, lymphocytes undergo positive and negative selection. Positive selection generates a functional T cell repertoire restricted to self MHC expressed on the epithelial cells of the thymic cortex. Negative selection eliminates T cells that are aggressively reactive to self antigen (Goldrath and Bevan, 1999, Janewa et al., 2004). Consequently, the beneficial region, which has high affinity with non-self antigen and low affinity with self antigen, is biologically realistic. Furthermore, the vector vaccine must replicate effectively in autoimmune disease patients, which means that the orbit converges to Ec*. We remark that the vaccine might be unable to replicate (the orbit converges to Ea+) according to patients\u2019 states because of bistability. Therefore, the vector vaccine might have to be used with other immunosuppressive drugs to switch the patient state from Ea+ to Ec*. Although many restrictions discussed above exist for the success of therapeutic vaccine, we can theoretically design the transgenic vector vaccine (because of these stringent restrictions, it is also true that the transgenic vector vaccine might only be effective to certain specific patient states). Moreover, if we consider the additional effects for suppression of autoreactive immune cells, these restrictions can be relaxed. However, we leave the inclusion of additional effects as a subject for future work.",

Viruses are an important factor that can precipitate autoimmune disease by various mechanisms (Fujinami, 2004, Pender, 2004, von Herrath et al., 2003). For example, viruses that stimulate the production of IL-12, such as herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus, have been isolated from or have been associated with exacerbation of MS (Fujinami, 2001, Libbey and Fujinami, 2002, Monteiro et al., 1998, Whitton and Fujinami, 1999). On the other hand, viruses can abrogate an ongoing autoimmune reaction by inducing apoptosis of autoreactive cells, by secreting various cytokines, or by immune suppression (Fujinami, 2001). Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain direct evidence for virus-induced initiation of autoimmune disease or protection from autoimmune disease because we are all infected by multiple viruses (Fujinami et al., 2006).",

We demonstrated that sigmoid function such as f2 can induce a bistable structure and periodic behavior. As described in this paper, we omit the target cell dynamics and add the viral replication cycle compared with the model considered in Iwami et al. (2007a). The difference of immune response functions also strongly affects the autoimmune disease symptoms. If the virus cannot establish a persistent infection (k-u<0), then f2 induces bistability (Fig. 3(c)) but f1 does not, then (Fig. 2(c)). On the other hand, if the virus can replicate itself (k-u>0), then f2 induces bistability and a periodic orbit (Fig. 3(d)), but f1 does not, then (Fig. 2(d)). Consequently, the sigmoid function f2, which is biologically more reasonable (because APCs only slightly induce immune cells when only a few antigens exist, Iwami et al., 2007a) than the convex function f1 represents various symptoms such as relapse in autoimmune disease. That slight inducement implies that the various symptoms of autoimmune disease might be related with the function. However, the results might not be sufficiently robust to the form of immune proliferation function. We need to know an appropriate proliferation function that has biological relevance. For example, APCs are known to induce immune cells only slightly when many antigens exist (high zone tolerance) (Janewa et al., 2004). For that reason, we might have to use a bell-shaped proliferation function to consider high zone tolerance instead of the proliferation as an increasing function of antigen load (De Boer et al., 1993, De Boer et al., 1996). Consequently, a more complete understanding of immune proliferation must be the foundation for the development of a therapeutic vaccine.",

It has been suggested that a determinant spreading (self-antigen diversification) is a relapse mechanism (Lehmann et al., 1993). Furthermore, in Borghans et al. (1998), they showed that T cell regulatory circuitry induces autoimmune relapse using a simple mathematical model. Another possible mechanism of the relapse is considered as cross-reactive immune responses through a process of molecular mimicry. In our model, relapses can also occur under the viral infection with molecular mimicry (in the absence of determinant spreading). The immune response function f2 can induce a limit cycle that corresponds to relapse of autoimmune disease only when the virus can replicate itself (see Fig. 4). This implies that the viral infection engenders the relapse. Therefore, our model supports that the cross-reactive immune response is also a relapse mechanism.",
