However, trial findings and guideline recommendations continue to be conflicting, making the translation of evidence into practice challenging. Further, it is becoming evident that the stage of critical illness and individual factors such as body composition may be important when considering how individuals might respond to nutrition interventions [3, 4]. This narrative review aims to provide a summary and interpretation of the adult critical care nutrition literature, with a particular focus on continuing practice gaps and areas with new data, to help clinicians make practical, yet evidence-based decisions regarding nutrition management during critical illness.",

It is essential that clinicians understand these processes and the impact on nutrient metabolism [4]. In 1942, Cuthbertson described two distinct metabolic phases during acute illness\u2014the \u2018ebb\u2019 or early shock phase, followed by the \u2018flow\u2019 or catabolic phase [6]. In brief, the \u2018ebb\u2019 phase is characterised by haemodynamic instability and hormonal changes (including insulin resistance) in order to prioritise the delivery of energy substrates to vital tissues [6, 7]. This survival mechanism results in endogenous glucose production as well as lower energy expenditure compared to pre-injury [4]. The \u2018flow\u2019 phase involves the breakdown of tissue (including lean muscle tissue) in order to provide substrates to cover the immediate needs for the \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response and to reduce the risk of bleeding and infection [4]. More recently, a third, anabolic recovery phase has been described [3]. It is during this recovery phase when resynthesis of lost tissue can take place and the body may be more metabolically able to process delivered nutrients [3, 4]. Currently, there is no known clinical marker to identify when an individual shifts from one phase of critical illness to another. For the purposes of this review which aims to provide practical recommendations, we have adapted the terminology from the 2019 European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) critical care guideline to describe the different stages of critical illness: ICU day 1\u20132 (acute early phase), ICU day 3\u20137 (acute late phase), and after ICU day 7 (recovery phase) [2].",

            "text": "While it is considered that nutrition may be more physiologically available and hence more important in the later phase of illness, due to the average intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), the majority of nutrition trials have provided nutrition interventions in the acute phases of illness (regardless of the intended trial intervention period). Traditionally, it was thought that aggressive nutrition in the early stages of critical illness may improve clinical outcomes. However, evidence from recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) does not support this, finding no benefit or harm with early nutrition delivery [8\u201311]. An explanation for this may be because a substantial amount of energy was provided in a period of critical illness where energy expenditure is decreased and endogenous production is enhanced [4]. Specifically, harm was observed in The Early Parenteral Nutrition Completing Enteral Nutrition in Adult Critically ill Patients (EPaNIC) trial, the largest nutrition trial in critical illness [10]. In a study of 4640 mixed ICU patients (n = 2818 (61%) cardiac surgery patients) who were eligible to receive EN, late initiation of PN (started on day 8 of the ICU stay) led to an increase in the proportion of patients discharged alive and earlier from ICU and hospital (hazard ratio (HR) 1.06; 95% CI 1.00\u20131.13; p = 0.04 for both) when compared to PN commenced within 48 h of ICU admission [10]. Late initiation PN also led to a reduction in infectious complications (22.8% vs 26.2%, p = 0.008), cholestasis, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), duration of renal replacement therapy, and health care costs [10]. Most recently, results from the largest enteral nutrition (EN) trial, The Augmented versus Routine approach to Giving Energy Trial (TARGET), support the theory that augmented energy delivery in the early phase of illness does not improve clinical outcomes compared to standard care [8]. This pragmatic prospective RCT of 3957 patients assessed 90-day mortality with augmented energy delivery (based on a predictive estimate of 1 ml/kg ideal body weight for height per day), compared to routine care [8]. Energy delivery was 50% higher in the intervention group (~ 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) over the median 6-day nutrition delivery period (and approximated clinician estimated energy aims) but did not impact mortality or any secondary clinical outcomes [8]. However, it must be noted this study included a very \u2018general\u2019 (or unselected) population and that overfeeding may have occurred. Further post hoc work may increase the understanding and clinical implications of these results. Lack of benefit has also been observed with hypocaloric (low energy and adequate protein) and trophic (low energy and protein) feeding strategies compared to standard care, also provided early in critical illness and for short periods [9, 12]. The results of these trials support the hypothesis that for mixed ICU patients, nutrition interventions in the acute early and acute late phase of critical illness may not impact clinical outcomes and may cause harm in some groups. Therefore, less than 100% of energy expenditure should be targeted in this period due to endogenous glucose production. It remains unknown whether nutrition interventions continued for longer, impact functional recovery and quality of life [3].",

A recent study in 84 critically ill patients reported a higher level of agreement between energy requirements estimated by the VCO2 method and measured REE compared to other predictive equations [20]. There are methodological limitations to note with this method: an assumed normal respiratory quotient (RQ) of 0.85 is used, which is the RQ of most nutritional products (with RQ = VCO2/VO2, normally ranging between 0.67 and 1.2 depending on the proportion of carbohydrate, fat, and protein being combusted) [23]. However, in critical illness, RQ may also be influenced by endogenous glucose production and by periods of hypo- and hyper-ventilation, and is likely to fluctuate between populations [19, 20].",

The first, published in 2011, included 130 patients and observed a trend towards reduced hospital mortality (primary outcome) in the intervention group using intention to treat (ITT) analysis (n = 21/65, 32.3%, vs 31/65, 47.7%, p = 0.058) [25]. However, infectious complications (n = 37 vs 20, p = 0.05) and mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) duration of MV (16.1 \u00b1 14.7 vs 10.5 \u00b1 8.3 days, p = 0.03) and ICU LOS (17.2 \u00b1 14.6 vs 11.7 \u00b1 8.4 days, p = 0.04) were increased in the intervention group compared to standard care [25]. In a more recent and slightly larger trial of 203 patients, no differences were observed in the primary outcome (self-reported physical component summary score of SF-36 at 6 months) between intervention and control in the ITT analysis (n = 199, 22.9 vs 23.0, p = 0.99, respectively) or in any clinically important secondary outcomes [11].

Lastly, in a pilot study (n = 40), no statistically significant differences were observed between groups in the primary outcome of change in bioelectrical impedance phase angle (related to nutritional status and prognosis) from baseline to ICU discharge [26]. However, a declining trend in mean phase angle was observed in the standard care group (3.31 \u00b1 1.34\u00b0 to 2.95 \u00b1 1.15\u00b0, p = 0.077), and a significantly shorter ICU LOS was reported in the intervention versus the standard care group (13 \u00b1 8 vs 24 \u00b1 20 days, p < 0.05) [26].",

Further, these studies aimed to meet 100% of indirect calorimetry targets early in the ICU admission, which recent evidence suggests is not beneficial, and there was limited investigation into high-risk subgroups in which indirect calorimetry may have avoided harm by under- or overfeeding (i.e. obesity).

Based on current evidence, the most significant benefit of using indirect calorimetry is to personalise energy prescription and avoid under- or overdelivery of energy across the different phases of critical illness. For this reason, it is the opinion of the authors that if indirect calorimetry is available, it should be used primarily in patients where the clinicians are concerned about under- or overestimating energy needs (i.e. obese and underweight individuals) [27]. When used, clinicians should aim for high-quality tests by reaching a steady test state (defined as a variation in VO2 and VCO2 less than 10% over five consecutive minutes), conduct tests for \u2265 30 min, and repeat tests at least weekly (or more frequently if clinically indicated) [24].",

Clinicians must be aware that accurate estimation of energy expenditure with a predictive equation requires considerable knowledge of the underlying patient condition, the factors that alter the metabolic response to illness, and the limitations of the equation being used. It is also important to consider that delivery of calories to meet measured or estimated energy expenditure may not equate to what should be provided to improve outcomes. This may be particularly relevant in the acute early phase of critical illness where endogenous substrate mobilisation provides a substantial portion of the energy requirement and insulin resistance occurs, and therefore, a conservative energy target should be the aim [28]. Energy prescription and energy delivery (including non-nutritional sources such as dextrose and propofol) should be regularly reviewed in the context of the patient\u2019s clinical condition and metabolic phase to prevent considerable under- or overfeeding [29].",

In the largest study (n = 2253), early protein delivery (> 0.7 g/kg/day versus \u2264 0.7 g/kg/day) was associated with increased survival (adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71\u20130.97, p = 0.017) [33]. Contrary to these findings, in a post hoc secondary analysis of the EPaNIC trial, a cumulative protein dose, rather than the cumulative glucose dose, early during ICU stay was associated with delayed ICU discharge [41]. Further, a single-centre retrospective cohort study (n = 455) reported a lower protein intake (< 0.8 g/kg/day) before day 3 and high protein intake (> 0.8 g/kg/day) after day 3 was associated with lower 6-month mortality (adjusted HR 0.609; 95% CI 0.480\u20130.772, p < 0.001) compared to patients with overall high protein intake [42]. Prospective, randomised data is required to inform the most appropriate amount and timing of protein to deliver to critically ill patients. Adequately powered RCTs are urgently needed to better understand the impact of both protein dose and timing on clinical outcomes in critical illness. Such trials should ideally control for energy delivery, by ensuring it is consistent across both the intervention and control groups.",

However, this continuous supply of nutrients does not mimic normal volitional intake which is most commonly in the form of boluses followed by periods of fasting. Recently, it has been proposed that bolus (intermittent) feeding may be more physiologic and therefore superior to continuous feeding [48]. A systematic review was conducted as part of the recent ESPEN guidelines to investigate whether bolus EN has an advantage over continuously administered EN [2]. Including 5 small prospective studies and 236 patients, a significant reduction in diarrhoea was observed with continuous versus bolus administration of EN (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19\u20130.91, p = 0.03) [2]. No differences in gastric residual volume, rates of aspiration, or pneumonia were observed. It has also been suggested that muscle protein synthesis may be improved when EN is delivered via a bolus when compared to continuous delivery, and a phase II multicentre RCT has recently completed recruitment to investigate this question (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02358512) [5, 48]. Moving from continuous to bolus delivery of EN in the ICU is a significant change to practice in most countries, which would require a variation in feeding protocols and extensive education of clinical staff. Due to the considerable practice change associated, until definitive evidence is available to support one method of delivery over the other, it is reasonable that clinicians continue to deliver EN via a continuous infusion.",

Guideline recommendations for when to commence PN differ and are outlined in Table 1.

Currently, these methods for assessing muscle mass and quality are mostly limited to research [64\u201366].

For this reason, RCT evidence attempting to investigate if patients who may be malnourished respond differently to nutrition is limited to subgroup analysis in patients with differing BMI categories or nutrition risk scores [10, 12, 67]. To date, no benefit has been observed when more or less nutrition is provided in these subgroups although the numbers included are often small. Further, BMI is a poor surrogate measure for malnutrition, and commonly used nutrition risk scores have not been well validated, which limits any conclusions on how nutrition therapy may affect outcomes in this vulnerable subgroup [2]. Despite the lack of evidence in this area, the authors support minimising progression of malnutrition. Where possible, clinicians should use local hospital guidelines or the recent GLIM criteria, combined with clinical judgement to diagnose malnutrition. As outlined in Fig. 1, in severely malnourished patients, we encourage early low dose nutrition therapy in the acute early phase, with a slow progression to target during the acute late phase, while carefully monitoring for refeeding syndrome.",

The median [interquartile range] energy and protein intake was 79% [41\u2013108%] and 73% [44\u201398%], respectively; however, considerable variation was observed depending on the type of nutrition therapy provided, with energy and protein provision the lowest in patients who received no additional oral nutrition supplements (37% [21\u201366%] of target energy and 48% [13\u201363%] protein) [71]. A second single-centre study of patients with traumatic brain injury indicated poorer intake post-ICU compared to in ICU, and nutritional deficit was significantly greater in patients who consumed oral nutrition alone compared to those receiving artificial nutrition support [72]. Despite this, dietitians spent just 20% of their time managing patients receiving oral nutrition therapy and saw the patients a mean of 2.2 (1.0) times per week for 34 (20) min per occasion on the post-ICU ward [72]. The predominant issues impacting nutrition intake are reported as appetite, disinterest in food, and taste changes [73].",

In one of the only studies investigating processes that impact nutrition in the post-ICU period, it was found that of nine patients transferred to the post-ICU ward, six had their gastric tube removed on the advice of the medical team without assessment of nutrition intake [73]. Early removal of gastric tubes may improve patient comfort and is encouraged by many post-surgical protocols, but has the potential to negatively impact nutrition intake [73]. The decision to remove a tube should be made on a case-by-case basis and after consultation with the patient, the treating team, and the dietitian [74]. Among other possible causes, it is plausible that inadequate nutrition following critical illness may result in significant energy and protein deficit and may explain the lack of benefit in long-term outcomes observed in nutrition studies that have delivered an intervention in the acute early and late phases. This is an important knowledge gap for investigation and to provide initial insights; a multicentre RCT is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03292237).",
