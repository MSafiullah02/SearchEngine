We show that the envelope glycoprotein Gn of hantaviruses binds genomic RNA through its cytoplasmic tail (CT). The nucleic acid binding of Gn-CT is unspecific, as demonstrated by interactions with unrelated RNA and with singlestranded DNA. Peptide scan and protein deletions of Gn-CT mapped the nucleic acid binding to regions that overlap with the previously characterized N protein binding sites and demonstrated the carboxyl-terminal part of Gn-CT to be the most potent nucleic acid-binding site. We conclude that recognition of the RNP complex by the Gn-CT could be mediated by interactions with both genomic RNA and the N protein. This would provide the required selectivity for the genome packaging of hantaviruses.",

However, members of the family Bunyaviridae do not contain a separate matrix protein and therefore interactions between the spike complex and RNPs are assumed to initiate assembly of the virions. Of the two hantavirus glycoprotein CTs, Gn-CT is considerably larger and capable of forming domain structures (~110 amino acids) while Gc-CT represents an intraviral insertion of a transmembrane anchor (~10 amino acids). The Gn-CT harbors a tandem zinc finger (ZF) fold, the structure of which was resolved by nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) (Estrada et al., 2009) . Gn-CT carries also a conserved endocytosis signal YxxL, functionally characterized in many cell surface proteins (Owen and Evans, 1998) , but its role in hantaviruses remains elusive. This motif resembles a class of late domain (L-domain) motifs (Bieniasz, 2006; Groseth et al., 2010) , that are commonly utilized by matrix proteins to drive the budding process of viruses. Taken together, the Gn-CT is assumed to operate as a surrogate matrix protein of hantaviruses.",

For CCHFV this interaction was shown to involve a ZF domain of Gn-CT that closely resembles the one found in hantaviruses. However, in the same study the ZF domain of hantaviruses could not bind RNA when expressed without the flanking regions. In this report we aimed to investigate the ability of the full Gn-CT of hantaviruses to interact with genomic RNA. We show an interaction between PUUV Gn (but not Gc) and exogenous 32 P-labeled genomic RNA by cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The nucleic acid binding site is pin-pointed to Gn-CT using GST-fused recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides. The results indicate that the binding ability of Gn-CT towards nucleic acids is rather unspecific since in addition to genomic RNA, also unrelated RNA as well as single-stranded DNA was able to interact with Gn-CTs of PUUV and TULV. The nucleic acid binding activity of hantavirus Gn-CT resided predominantly at the C-terminal part of the protein. In conclusion we hypothesize the RNA-Gn-CT interaction to be linked to the assembly process of hantaviruses.",

Purified, lysed and micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-treated virus preparation and in vitro transcribed and radiolabeled genomic PUUV S segment were allowed to form RNA-protein complexes prior to UV cross-linking. Samples were subsequently treated with RNase A in order to facilitate separation of proteins according to their molecular size in SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Western blotting using N, Gn and Gc antibodies. The RNA binding to viral proteins was studied in parallel by separating identically treated sample in SDS-PAGE and using autoradiography for detection. Firstly, the successful transcriptions of the S segment (~2 kilobases {kB}) together with an unrelated marker RNA (unRNA of 2 kB) were verified on a TBE-Urea gel (Fig. 1A) . From Fig. 1B it is evident that the bands migrating above 250 kDa and at 50 kDa remained radiolabeled after RNase A-treatment, indicating cross-linking of RNA to proteins of the indicated sizes. Interestingly, the most intense radioactivity (above 250 kDa) overlapped with the band recognized by anti-Gn immunoblot which suggested that the genomic RNA interacts with Gn. The band detected by autoradiography at 50 kDa overlapped with the band recognized by N protein immunoblot. This was expected since the RNAbinding properties of N protein are well-characterized (Gott et al., 1993; Mir and Panganiban, 2004; Severson et al., 1999) .",

In addition to the genomic S segment RNA of PUUV, we used an excessive amount of radiolabeled unrelated RNA (unRNA) as a non-genomic RNA substrate to analyze the RNA-binding specificity of viral proteins. Similarly to what was observed using PUUV, the radioactivity after RNase A-treatment was retained in the bands that by migration represent Gn and N proteins. The same pattern of RNA-bound proteins was observed with exogenous hantavirus S segment and the unRNA. The capacity of both N and Gn protein to bind both viral and unRNA suggests that the RNA-binding activity of these proteins did not absolutely require a specific sequence or structure of the RNA substrate. However, our experimental set-up was not optimized to study the binding affinity of proteins to different RNA sequences since the amounts of added RNAs differed and thus we cannot rule out the possibility that viral proteins was incubated with purified MNase-treated PUUV lysate, UV cross-linked, treated with RNase A and the proteins were separated in 6% SDS-PAGE (B). As indicated, the PUUV proteins were detected by immunoblotting using Gn-or Gc-specific PAb and N-specific MAb 5E1, a combination of appropriate IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies and Odyssey infrared imaging. Protein-bound nucleotides were detected by autoradiography. M indicates the marker lane. Fig. 2 . Cross-linking of exogenous 32 P-RNA to TULV proteins. TULV RNA-binding proteins were detected by Western blotting (using Gn-or Gc-specific PAb and N-specific MAb 3C11) and autoradiography as described in Fig. 1B (A) . Two different autoradiography exposures (long and short) emphasize the difference in the concentrations of the applied exogenous S-RNA vs. unRNA (500 vs. 2500 CPM; specific activities of the probes were similar). Reduced mobility of Gn in SDS-PAGE due to UV-induced cross-linking is shown (B). TULV preparations were treated and immunoblotted as described in Fig. 1B but without exogenous RNA. would prefer genomic RNA over unrelated. We further observed that while N and Gc proteins migrated mainly as monomers, the mobility of PUUV and TULV Gn were drastically reduced after RNA-binding and UV-induced cross-linking (Figs. 1B and 2A) . To assess whether this phenomenon is due to cross-linking alone we treated TULV as before but without the addition of exogenous RNA (Fig. 2B ). The mobility of Gn was clearly reduced by UV cross-linking thereby showing that the exogenously applied RNA is probably not responsible for the reduced mobility of Gn in SDS-PAGE.",

Since these PAbs are known to cross-react with TULV proteins in Western blot, we firstly wanted to verify their ability also to immunoprecipitate the envelope proteins of TULV. For this purpose we used metabolically radiolabeled lysates of both PUUV and TULV as the source of viral proteins in immunoprecipitation with Gn-and Gc-specific PAbs. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography according to their typical migration pattern (Fig. 3A) . The results demonstrated that the Gn-and Gc-specific PAbs cross-react between PUUV and TULV and in both cases precipitate, in addition to their respective target antigens, also a complex formed of Gn and Gc. Unexpectedly the PUUV Gc PAb seemed to precipitate TULV Gc more efficiently than its native antigen. This suggests differences in the accessibility between Gc of PUUV and TULV towards this PAb. Both PAbs favor their target antigens over the Gn-Gc complex which is in contrast to the PUUV Gn-and Gc-specific MAbs 5A2 and 4G2 that both precipitate close to equimolar amounts of Gn and Gc (Hepojoki et al., 2010a; Hepojoki et al., 2010b; Strandin et al., 2011) .",

The amount of precipitated RNA is reported as a fold of increase compared to the value obtained with negative PAb. The Gn-specific antibodies precipitated the highest amount of RNA in the case of both PUUV and TULV, and thus the RNA-binding activity of Gn was further solidified. The substantially higher amount of RNA precipitated by TULV Gn compared to PUUV Gn is at least partially explained by the different amounts of applied RNA (approximately 5 times more of unRNA than S segment RNA). The amount of viral proteins in precipitates of PUUV and TULV was nearly the same ( Fig. 3A) suggesting that the maximum RNA-binding capacity of PUUV Gn could be considerably higher than detected with the amount of exogenous S segment RNA used in this experiment.",

This would also explain the fairly low amount of exogenous RNA cross-linked to N protein as compared to Gn in the cross-linking experiments (Figs. 1B and 2A) .

We compared the amounts of Gn-CT bound nucleic acids to plain GST and report the results as fold change (Fig. 4B ). The results indicated that the Gn-CTs of PUUV and TULV bind to both RNA and DNA. The observed difference in nucleic acid binding between Gn-CT of TULV and Gn-CT of PUUV is likely due to a higher level of expression of TULV Gn-CT as compared to PUUV Gn-CT as demonstrated in Fig. 4A . It seems that there is also more plain GST in the PUUV Gn-CT preparation as compared to TULV Gn-CT. However, since plain GST as negative control did not show significant binding to nucleic acids, this should not influence the obtained results. The fact that the unrelated RNA bound both CTs more efficiently than the genomic RNA and the ability of Gn-CT to bind also relative short DNAs further solidifies the unspecific nature of the nucleic acid recognition of Gn-CT.

The mapping indicated that the same peptides that were previously shown to interact with RNP and N protein (Hepojoki et al., 2010b) were capable of binding also nucleic acids (Fig. 5A ). Next we wanted to study the nucleic acid binding capacity of the three binding sites individually using biotinylated soluble peptides Gn N , Gn M and Gn C , which represent the N-binding sites 1, 2 and 3 of PUUV Gn-CT as described earlier (Hepojoki et al., 2010b) . Schematic presentation of the peptides with respect to the primary sequence of PUUV Gn-CT is shown in Fig. 6 . We also used the synthetic peptide corresponding to Gc-CT, which in the earlier study was also shown to bind N protein (Hepojoki et al., 2010b) . The peptides were pre-bound to avidin beads through biotin and analyzed for RNA-or DNA-binding activity similarly as was done for GST-fused proteins (Fig. 4) . The Gn C showed the strongest binding of the analyzed peptides irrespective of the applied nucleic acids (Fig. 5B) . Also Gn M showed significant RNA-binding capacity but only very little DNA-binding activity. The binding levels of Gn N and Gc-CT were above control (biotin-bound avidin beads) but clearly lower than those of Gn M or Gn C .

The strongest DNA-binding peptides of TULV Gn-CT (Fig. 7A) located to the C-terminal part of the protein and overlapped with the corresponding sequence of PUUV Gn C peptide. This result suggested that the main nucleic acid binding site in Gn is conserved among hantaviruses and locates to the Cterminal part of the Gn-CT which contains the putative late domain motif YRTL and is adjacent to the membrane-spanning signal sequence for Gc. To confirm the significance of this region to nucleic acid binding we used a previously described (Wang et al., 2010) truncated GST-fusion protein of TULV Gn-CT lacking the C-terminal DNA-binding sequence (Figs. 6 and 7B) . When comparing the RNAand DNA-binding activities of this mutant (Gn-CTdel13) to the fulllength Gn-CT of TULV in a similar GST pull-down as before, we observed that the RNA-binding capacity of the mutant was completely abolished (Fig. 7C) . However, the DNA-binding activity was seen only to diminish due to the deletion of the C-terminal part, and thus we conclude that while the whole Gn-CT containing the ZF domain might be important in regulating nucleic acid binding it is the C-terminal part that is mainly responsible for this activity.

            "text": "In this report we show using several techniques that the Gn protein of hantaviruses is able to bind nucleic acids and map this interaction to its CT. Furthermore, by using peptide array we were able to pin-point this interaction to the very C-terminus of Gn-CT. In our previous study we demonstrated that the CTs of both Gn and Gc interact with the native RNP consisting of N protein and N proteinencapsidated genomic RNA (Hepojoki et al., 2010b; Wang et al., 2010) . We also showed recombinant N protein to be able to mediate binding to Gn-and Gc-CT; however, we were unable to rule out the involvement of nucleic acids in these interactions. The results in this report show that the N protein encapsidated genomic RNA could be directly involved in the interaction between glycoprotein CTs and RNP. This is supported by the fact that the binding sites of nucleic acids and N protein either overlap or are contiguous in the primary sequence of Gn-CT. Thus amino acid residues of N protein and nucleotides from genomic RNA would form the interaction surface in RNP that mediates the binding to glycoprotein CTs. Our results corroborate recent findings suggesting that Gn-CTs of other bunyaviruses could bind genomic RNA. For RVFV of phleboviruses it was demonstrated that genomic RNA is required for the efficient release of infectious VLPs and the authors hypothesized that this would occur through direct recognition of viral RNA by Gn-CT (Piper et al., 2011) . Furthermore a ZF domain in Gn-CT of CCHFV (nairovirus), closely resembling the one found in hantavirus Gn-CT (Estrada et al., 2009) , was found to bind viral RNA and again a role for this interaction in virus assembly was suggested (Estrada and De Guzman, 2011) .",

During infection the cells may contain various types of nucleic acids encapsidated by the viral nucleoproteins; however, mainly the genomic RNA is incorporated into virions and this requires accentuated regulation of genome packaging. Several enveloped viruses encode a matrix protein that bridges between the RNP and the viral envelope. Hantaviruses do not possess an individual matrix protein and based on recent evidence, instead, the relatively large Gn-CT substitutes for this activity (Battisti et al., 2010; Hepojoki et al., 2010a; Huiskonen et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010) . The matrix protein of both family Bornaviridae (Neumann et al., 2009) and Orthomyxoviridae (Elster et al., 1997; Wakefield and Brownlee, 1989; Ye et al., 1989) viruses have been shown to bind, in addition to the viral core proteins, also the genomic RNA. Thus our results suggest by analogy the Gn-CT of hantaviruses to be equivalent of a matrix protein in the family Bunyaviridae. Prior to recent reports for CCHFV and RVFV (Estrada and De Guzman, 2011; Piper et al., 2011) , interaction involving a viral envelope protein and its genomic RNA has only been shown for the family Coronaviridae, where the envelope protein M recognizes the viral RNA packaging signal and incorporates itself in to the nascent virions independently of the core protein (Narayanan et al., 2003) . However, the M protein of coronaviruses possesses only a tiny extracellular domain, thus differing from the spikeforming glycoprotein Gn of hantaviruses.",

Mapping of the nucleic acid binding sites in the Gn-CT of PUUV. The Gn-CT (amino acids 525-638) was synthesized in CelluSpot\u2122 format as partially overlapping 20-residue peptides with a 3-residue shift. The CelluSpot TM slide was probed with the IRdye800-conjugated 42-mer single-stranded DNA (A). The signal detected in Odyssey infrared imaging for each individual peptide is shown on the left side next to the amino acid sequence of the respective peptide. The indicated binding sites 1-3 were determined for N protein using SPOT peptide assay as previously described (Hepojoki et al., 2010b; Wang et al., 2010) , and are colored grey. PUUV Gn-CT peptides were used to pull-down nucleic acids (B). Monomeric avidin beads preloaded to saturation by the biotinylated peptides Gn N , Gn M , Gn C and Gc-CT were used to pull-down RNA ( 32 P-S-RNA in 400 CPM and 32 P-unRNA in 500 CPM) or IRdye800-conjugated DNA (IRdye800conjugated 42mer 3\u2032-end of hantavirus S-segment, 100 nM) and detections were done by scintillation counting and Odyssey infrared imaging, respectively. Results are indicated as a fold increase in respect to biotin-saturated avidin beads. Fig. 6 . Scheme of Gn-CT peptides and proteins used to map nucleic acid-binding sites in PUUV and TULV. The full length cytoplasmic tails of PUUV and TULV Gn (111 amino acids) and TULV Gn-CT with 13 residue C-terminal deletion (Gn-CTdel13) were expressed as N-terminal GST-fusion proteins (Wang et al., 2010) . Biotinylated peptides (Gn N , Gn M and Gn C ) derived from PUUV Gn-CT was synthesized as described previously (Hepojoki et al., 2010b) . The amino acid numbers in the image refer to the PUUV or TULV glycoprotein precursors. influenza viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae, the eight-segmented genome is recognized via packaging signals formed of secondary structures in RNA (Hutchinson et al., 2010) . Although the exact mechanism of genome incorporation in to virions is not known, it has been shown that the matrix protein M1 interacts with RNP (Baudin et al., 2001; Elster et al., 1997; Noton et al., 2007; Ye et al., 1999) . The M1 protein harbors a ZF and a nuclear localization signal with RNA-binding abilities (Elster et al., 1997; Wakefield and Brownlee, 1989; Ye et al., 1999; Ye et al., 1989) . Interestingly, the influenza M1 has been shown to repress endogenous viral transcription through its RNA-binding domains (Perez and Donis, 1998; Watanabe et al., 1996; Ye et al., 1989) . This activity could be biologically relevant in the late stages of infection where it would halt viral mRNA production and thereby trigger the packaging of viral genome eventually leading to the egress of virions. Similarly to influenza M1, the matrix protein Z of arenaviruses also acts as a transcriptional repressor (Cornu and de la Torre, 2001; Cornu and de la Torre, 2002; Lopez et al., 2001) , and a ZF domain is required for this activity. Curiously, most bunyavirus Gn-CTs also contain a ZF domain (Estrada et al., 2009 ) the functions of which are currently unknown. Unlike the ZF domain of CCHFV, the ZF-domain of hantavirus Gn-CT is unable to bind RNA directly (Estrada and De Guzman, 2011) . However, according to the results of the present study there are other motifs in Gn-CT capable of binding RNA and thus a regulatory role in viral transcription for the hantavirus ZF cannot be ruled out. Since the matrix proteins of some non-segmented negativesense RNA viruses have also been described to regulate transcription through interaction with the RNP (Ghildyal et al., 2002; Iwasaki et al., 2009; Suryanarayana et al., 1994) , it is intriguing to speculate that hantavirus Gn-CT would, through binding to RNP, mediate regulatory functions in gene expression and in virion packaging. Further studies regarding the functions of Gn-CT in hantavirus assembly or replication would greatly benefit from reverse genetics or infectious virus-like particle generation systems that are unfortunately still lacking today for these viruses.",

For the binding of DNA, the IRdye800-conjugated singlestranded oligonucleotide (100 nM) was incubated for 1 h under shaking at RT and the bound DNA was eluted after two washes with BB by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. 1 \u03bcl of the LSB eluate (corresponding to 1 \u03bcl bead volume) was dot-blotted on to nitrocellulose, cross-linked by UV and the amount of IRdye800-conjugated oligonucleotide quantified using Odyssey. The results are presented as a fold change as compared to negative control.",
