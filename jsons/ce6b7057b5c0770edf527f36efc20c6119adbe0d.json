The recommended antiviral drugs are interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), lopinavir/ ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine diphosphate and arbidol [2] which have been used in the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. Based on the available evidences, IFN-\u03b1 nebulization can be used in children, and it has shown good safety profiles under most circumstances. However, children are particularly sensitive to the accumulation of chloroquine phosphate in the body, which could possibly induce severe retinopathy, ototoxicity and cardiotoxicity. On the other hand, it lacks data on the safety of using lopinavir/ritonavir and abidor for children under 2 years of age. In the absence of adequate evidence for efficacy and safety, experts have not reached on an agreement on using ribavirin in the pediatric population. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children (Second Edition) recommend the use of IFN-\u03b1, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin in children, without specifying age limitation [10] . The recommended dosage of ribavirin infusion varies in different medical literatures. Some suggest intravenous infusion of ribavirin administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every time (maximum 500 mg every time), 2-3 times daily [10] , whereas others recommend 10-15 mg/ kg per day, divided into 2-3 times daily [11] .",

These children may have no clinical manifestations, such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms, etc. A case of a 1.5-month-old infant diagnosed with COVID-19 experienced frequent vomiting [1, 2, 4, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children are different from those in adults, and it is likely that differences also exist between children at different ages. It is unknown whether the disease process, treatment response and exposure response relationship of children with COVID-19 are like those of adults. According to the guidelines for clinical trials of pediatric drugs, it is not suitable to perform extrapolation on drug efficacy from adults to children. And children are not little adults. So comprehensive and systematic drug safety and efficacy clinical trials in pediatric population should be planned and conducted as early as possible once the clinical trial data of preliminary safety and potential benefits for adults have been acquired [19] .",
