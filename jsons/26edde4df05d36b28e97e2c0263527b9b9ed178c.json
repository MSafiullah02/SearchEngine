The characteristics of participants are shown in supplementary file S2. A total of 405 (43.7%) reported moderate-to-much exacerbation of psoriasis. After adjustments, outdoor activity restriction was positively associated with the exacerbation of psoriasis, stress, and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a dose-response manner, but was not associated with nonadherence (Table 1) . Similarly, income loss was associated with the exacerbation of psoriasis, stress, and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Table 2) . Differently, income loss was significantly associated with nonadherence to treatment, but was not associated with healthcare utilization. To further determine the independent factors, stepwise regression was 4 conducted, and we found that nonadherence to treatment (aOR=3.69; 95%CI: 2.67-5.18), stress (aOR=1.17; 95%CI: 1.11-1.23), quarantine (aOR=2.05; 95%CI: 1.33-3.18), and income loss (aOR=1.51; 95%CI: 1.06-2.15) were independently associated with the exacerbation of psoriasis.",

Isolation and temporarily closed outpatient service further limited the patients' accessibility to healthcare, especially for those who were not familiar with or accessible to teledermatology, resulting in discontinued treatment and deteriorated condition. 5 In conclusion, telemedicine and supply of drug in addition to mental health intervention are needed for patients with psoriasis to improve their health outcomes.
