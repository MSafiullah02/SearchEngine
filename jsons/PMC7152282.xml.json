Cyclophosphamide-containing regimens predispose patients to hemorrhagic cystitis. Fludarabine is less cytotoxic but intensely immunosuppressive and is often included in reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens.9 Antithymocyte globulin, which alters the function of or depletes T cells and other lymphocytes, can be used as conditioning regimen for aplastic anemia and, at times, for GVHD prevention or treatment.10 Serum sickness\u2014a syndrome of fever, arthralgia, and rash\u2014can occur with antithymocyte globulin or other xenoprotein therapy; it is treated with corticosteroid therapy. Antilymphoid antibodies, including alemtuzumab or rituximab, can induce prolonged and profound lymphopenia. Some GVHD prevention strategies include ex vivo graft manipulation (CD34+ or CD3\u2212 selection) for T-lymphocyte depletion. A new approach is post-HSCT cyclophosphamide (on days 3 and 4 after grafting) to lyse proliferating alloreactive lymphoid cells. Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, or sirolimus (and other agents) are often used for weeks to months after allografting to lessen the risks and severity of GVHD. Although all these may reduce the risks for GVHD, these maneuvers also substantially delay immune recovery, particularly in haploidentical (one HLA haplotype matched) or HLA-mismatched HSCT.",

Allogeneic HSCT has the highest chance of prompt engraftment when fully HLA-matched sibling donor transplants are used, but fewer than 30% of intended recipients have a matched sibling donor available.19, 20, 21 Well-matched unrelated donor or umbilical cord blood or partial matched related donor grafts are also suitable for some patients.

Cystitis that occurs within the first weeks after marrow infusion usually is noninfectious in origin, caused instead by the administration of high-dose cyclophosphamide in the conditioning regimen.28 Prophylactic measures include mesna (for binding and elimination of the alkylator metabolites of cyclophosphamide), forced diuresis, and continuous bladder irrigation. Supportive care for established cystitis may also necessitate large-bore catheter drainage or bladder irrigation and transfusions. Later in the post-transplantation period, GVHD and infection are contributing causes of cystitis.29 The majority of infectious agents inducing cystitis are viral, usually either the polyomavirus BK virus or adenovirus. Infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), the polyomavirus JC virus, human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), various bacteria, and Strongyloides occurs in lower frequencies.30, 31, 32 Use of fluoroquinolone antibacterial prophylaxis may be preventive for BK viruria.33 Polyomaviruses are shed in the urine in many HSCT patients without clinical symptoms (see Chapter 147).34 Higher urine or detectable blood viral loads of BK virus may indicate a higher risk for hemorrhagic cystitis.35 No standard antiviral treatment is currently available for viruria caused by BK virus or adenovirus, although intravesicular cidofovir or low-dose intravenous cidofovir has been administered when ongoing hemorrhage or large mucosal clots persist despite continuous bladder irrigation.36\n",

The rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria are responsible for catheter exit site infections, tunnel infections, bacteremia (with waterborne Mycobacterium mucogenicum), or pneumonia.124, 125 Infection with Mycobacterium tuber\u00adculosis occurs predominantly in countries with high endemic rates; the number of cases may be increasing worldwide as transplantation becomes available globally.126, 127, 128, 129, 130 Transplantation candidates and donors who are at risk for reactivation of latent tuberculosis can be readily identified during the pretransplantation evaluation on the basis of residence in endemic areas or close contact with another person with known or suspected tuberculosis. For these transplantation candidates, screening is recommended with tuberculin skin testing or an ex vivo interferon-\u03b3 release assay, such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold.131, 132, 133, 134 Clinically significant infection can be prevented by extended-duration antituberculous prophylaxis when QuantiFERON-TB Gold assays or reactive tuberculin skin testing yields positive results. Potential transplantation patients and donors should also receive screening if they have a history of abnormal chest radiographic findings before HSCT, have recently traveled to a foreign country for longer than 3 months, have been employed in an institution with tuberculous clients, have a history of alcoholism or intravenous drug use, or are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). QuantiFERON-TB Gold has 96% to 99% specificity that is unaffected by the vaccine for bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin.135 For patients with a positive result of a screening test but no signs of active tuberculosis and no previous antituberculous therapy, a chest radiograph and liver function studies should be obtained, in addition to peritransplantation and 9-month post-transplantation therapy with isoniazid and pyridoxine.",

These species include Legionella feeleii, Legionella micdadei, and Legionella bozemanae.\n139 Infection can persist or relapse after 3 weeks of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, which suggests that prolonged antibiotic treatment is indicated for HSCT recipients with legionellosis.138 Medical therapies for nocardiosis often consist of administration of sulfonamide in combination with a synergistic agent such as ceftazidime or imipenem-cilastatin; adjunctive surgical d\u00e9bridement may be useful for catheter-related infections with this organism.

Patients who do not respond to acyclovir after engraftment, and particularly those who have received prolonged or repeated courses of acyclovir, may have acyclovir-resistant HSV. Foscarnet or cidofovir may be beneficial in that setting. In uncommon cases, HSV infection causes Bell's palsy, hepatitis, or encephalitis.

Upper respiratory tract illness with parainfluenza usually resolves without serious sequelae. Lower tract infection has a mortality rate of 80% for respiratory syncytial virus and 30% to 35% for parainfluenza virus.193, 203, 204 Therapy with aerosolized ribavirin or a combination of ribavirin and IVIG has been used for respiratory syncytial virus, although rigorous trials to determine its efficacy are not available.191, 205 The survival rate appears to be higher when treatment is initiated before significant hypoxia is present, and aerosolized ribavirin may help to decrease the viral burden.205, 206 There are only anecdotal case reports regarding the effectiveness of ribavirin for treatment of other respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza, adenovirus, and influenza. Preemptive therapy with aerosolized ribavirin in patients with positive nasopharyngeal cultures for respiratory syncytial virus appears promising. Patients who develop respiratory viral pneumonia before engraftment have poorer outcomes. Aerosolized ribavirin (Virazole) is administered by a face mask to adults through a small-particle aerosol generator. This device can be used for patients on a ventilator. Although there are no data on what dose may be effective, 6 g (one vial) per 12 hours once daily is a schedule that has been used. Contamination of the patient's room with this possibly teratogenic agent is of concern to pregnant hospital staff (see Chapter 44).",

GVHD is a risk factor for the suppression of cell-mediated immunity that is critical for host defense against Toxoplasma gondii.\n292 The clinical presentation includes fever, encephalitis with focal cerebral lesions, pneumonitis, or myocarditis. One postmortem diagnosis of disseminated toxoplasmosis was associated with hemophagocytic syndrome.293 Parasitemia is a feature of reactivation that may be identified in tissue culture, although many diagnoses are now made with PCR.294, 295 In countries where the prevalence of this infection is high, pretransplant detection of DNA using PCR may indicate those at highest risk for infection after transplant.296 Stereotactic brain biopsy is also useful in diagnosis of the infection.297 The identifiable risk period is 2 to 8 weeks after HSCT, and toxoplasmosis is more common among those receiving myeloablative conditioning.298 Seropositive patients not receiving TMP-SMX are at risk for breakthrough toxoplasmosis.299 For these patients, Toxoplasma reactivation can be monitored through PCR assay during the first 1 to 3 months after HSCT.300 However, in countries where the prevalence is low, routine prophylaxis is not justified.",

Such patients should be revaccinated every 10 years with the combined tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis toxoid, absorbed. Vaccination with acellular pertussis does not generate enough immunity, so vaccines with higher-dose pertussis toxoid should be used until transplant recipients are further studied.305 At 6 months, they should also be immunized against polio by the inactivated intramuscular vaccine, H. influenzae type B, hepatitis B, and S. pneumoniae. If the patient was previously immunized, only one dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given. Postvaccine titers of hepatitis B virus should be documented to ensure response and adequate protection, even when the vaccine is given at the specified time interval after HSCT.306 At 2 years, a second dose of pneumococcal vaccine is optional; it provides a second opportunity to vaccinate persons who failed to respond to the first dose, especially patients with chronic GVHD. Lifelong, seasonal administration of influenza vaccine should begin before HSCT and resume by 2 to 6 months after HSCT. Children younger than 9 years who are receiving influenza vaccination for the first time require two doses yearly. Adults do not benefit from receiving two influenza vaccine doses.307 Influenza vaccine for HSCT ward employees, clinical health care workers, and household contacts may be especially necessary within the first year or for patients with ongoing GVHD, in whom protective responses may be impaired. For health care workers directly caring for HSCT recipients, the live, attenuated intranasal vaccine should be avoided to limit inadvertent exposure to patients. Vaccination with the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine has not been studied but may be appropriate for male and female long-term transplant recipients ages 9 to 26 years and perhaps for women older than age 26 who are at risk for squamous intraepithelial lesions.308, 309\n",

IVIG does not prevent infections when given weekly during the preengraftment or late risk periods, but it does reduce rates of septicemia and localized infection when given in the postengraftment risk period after transplantation.313, 314, 315 It may modulate the severity of GVHD.316 Replacement IVIG (200 to 500 mg/kg every 1 to 2 weeks) may be beneficial for patients with immunoglobulin G levels lower than 400 mg/dL; however, in one prospective trial, routine use of IVIG delayed the recovery of antigen (viral)\u2013specific immunity.314\n",

High-titer CMV globulin for prevention of CMV infection and treatment of end-organ CMV disease has proved to be of clear benefit in comparison with IVIG. However, antiviral drugs are effective in providing protection against CMV disease. Therefore, because of its limited availability, as well as cost considerations, the use of CMV-specific globulin is minimal at most transplantation centers. Hyperimmune respiratory syncytial virus globulin provided only a very modest increase in neutralizing antibody when given in the first 6 weeks after HSCT.208 Hepatitis B, human rabies, and tetanus immune globulin should be used as needed in the event of exposures. VariZIG is a human polyclonal immunoglobulin G available for intramuscular or intravenous administration under an expanded access program through Cangene Corporation for patients at high risk within the first 10 days of exposure.317 VariZIG administration may extend the varicella incubation period from 10 days to as much as 28 days, is expensive, and is not uniformly effective in preventing chickenpox in patients who have undergone HSCT.",
