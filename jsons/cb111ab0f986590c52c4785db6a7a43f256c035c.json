Temporal analysis applied to this type of scenarios could be an additional tool for limiting disruption among civilians allowing for recognizing typical temporal progression and duration of symptoms in first infected people. We propose the application of a fuzzy temporal reasoning system we have developed for biomedical temporal data analysis in different scenarios after a hypothetical attack. The system is able to handle both qualitative and metric temporal knowledge affected by vagueness and uncertainty, taking into account in this way the vagueness of patients reports expressed in natural language.",

It may be less clear in a civilian population [1] , supposed to be in a period of peace. For this reason establishing a diagnosis is critical to the public health response to a bioterrorism-related epidemic, since the diagnosis will guide the use of vaccinations, medications, and other interventions [2] . Moreover, new or reemerging infectious diseases have relevant implications: during the past 20 years, over 30 new lethal pathogens have been identified; for example the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Southeast Asia rapidly spread to 29 countries in less than 90 days [3] . Emerging disease outbreaks may be difficult to distinguish from the intentional introduction of infectious diseases for nefarious purposes, when considering that Genetic Engineering of biological warfare agents can alter their pathogenicity, incubation periods, or even the clinical syndromes they cause. For this reason, it is important to develop automatic Syndromic Surveillance Systems [2] able to notify as soon as possible the early manifestations of bioterrorism-related diseases from population monitoring. A preliminary step towards the design of a component of such a System could be based on the use of temporal reasoning techniques in order to identify typical temporal progression of diseases.",
