Open reading frames (ORFs) are defined as DNA sequences with translation potential, consisting of a string of in\u2010frame codons flanked by a start codon and a stop codon. Traditionally, the definition of ORFs was sequences that potentially code for peptides of 100 amino acids (aa) or more, this length limit originates from bioinformatic approaches that were used for annotations. Since it was assumed that the majority of coding genes would code for larger proteins and a stretch of 100 codons without a stop codon provides a statistically significant signal, using 100 aa as a cut\u2010off provided a straightforward strategy to annotate genomes. However, in recent years there have been accumulating evidence for the prevalence of functional translation events from short ORFs (sORFs) encoding proteins with a length of 100 aa or less.1, 2\n",

An important functional subclass of translated sORFs are upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are located at the 5\u2032 leader sequence of mRNAs, upstream of the initiation codon of the main coding ORF. These have been shown to regulate translation efficiency via different mechanisms.3 In most of the cases studied to date, uORFs are cis acting and regulate their downstream ORF. Some examples of uORFs were described, termed peptoswitches, that respond to environmental cues.1 In these cases, small molecules bind to the nascent peptide leading to inhibition of translation of the main ORF by different mechanisms including non\u2010sense mediated decay4 and ribosome stalling.5 In addition, molecular functions were also assigned to sORF\u2010encoded peptides (SEPs), these include regulation of post\u2010translational modifications,6 regulation of metabolite transport,7 and inhibition of kinase activity.8 As expected by their different molecular functions, SEPs are involved in various biological processes including cell communication, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism.",

Ribosome footprints can indicate the positions of ribosomes with sub\u2010codon precision. Such high\u2010resolution information identifies the precise boundaries of translated regions as well as the specific reading frame in which translation occurs. While the ribosome decodes only a single codon at a time, it protects a much larger footprint, typically 28\u201332 nucleotides.9 The signature of the triplet genetic code is present in these larger footprints, as the footprint positions show a three\u2010nucleotide periodicity reflecting the translocation steps of the ribosome. This bias in footprint position provides a robust statistical signal that indicates which specific reading frame is being translated on an mRNA.9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n",

Detection of SEPs could provide insight into their stability and abundance and therefore can point to functionality. Improvements on the experimental and computational aspects of proteomic approaches30 assisted in discovery of tens of novel SEPs.31 For this, Slavoff et al. used peptidomics, a mass spectrometry\u2013based approach that is augmented for preservation and enrichment of small peptides, mainly by reducing proteolysis during sample processing. Generation of a dataset based on the human transcriptome taking into account out\u2010of\u2010frame alternative translation products has led to the discovery of 1259 alternative proteins, many of which derived from sORFs in different tissues and cell lines.32 Interestingly, many of these alternative proteins were found to be secreted. Thus, computational and proteomic approaches still have limitations when applied to search for SEPs, however they are constantly upgraded and improve our discovery capacity of the variety of these peptides. In this review, we will concentrate on sORFs in viruses focusing on known functions of virally encoded short proteins and how viral systems\u2014due to their high transcriptional levels, manipulatable genomes, and measurable phenotypes\u2014could provide opportunities to better decipher sORFs functions.",

Indeed, short transmembrane proteins were identified in a range of both RNA and DNA animal viruses and were shown to be involved in various viral processes including entry, genome replication, particle assembly and release as well as interfere with host processes. Some of these transmembrane proteins belong to a group of proteins named viroporins35, 36 which contain hydrophobic regions that upon oligomerization form aqueous pores in the host cellular membranes. Viroporins were mainly implicated in viral assembly and release.35 For example, a role in viral release was demonstrated for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vpu protein. Vpu is a \u223c80 aa viroporins that oligomerizes to form a selective ion channel37, 38, 39 that may enhance viral release through its ion channel activity and/or by inhibiting tetherin, a cellular factor which inhibits viral release.40, 41 Another extensively characterized viroporin is the 97 aa M2 influenza A virus (IAV) protein which oligomerizes to form an ion channel.42 During infection M2 localizes to the Golgi where it plays an important role in viral replication and assembly by perturbing protein trafficking due to its effect on the ion gradient in the secretory pathway.43 Furthermore, M2 is essential for viral release, mediating membrane curvature and scission.44, 45 M2 may also have a role in viral entry by mediating virion acidification46 which is required for the uncoating of the virus.47 Other short viral transmembrane proteins, which are not part of the viroporin family as they do not oligomerize, are vital for viral entry. The vaccinia 35 aa O3L protein has a hydrophobic domain and is incorporated into the membrane of the mature virion. Importantly, O3L associates with the virus entry/fusion complex and is essential for viral entry,48 a function which is conserved across many other poxviruses.49 Interestingly, vaccinia encodes many more short transmembrane proteins that were shown to have a role in viral entry and biogenesis.34\n",

By forming aqueous pores in cellular membranes viroporins perturb membrane permeability leading to alterations in cellular ionic homeostasis and thus to cytopathic effects.35 In addition, some of the short transmembrane viral proteins interfere with various cellular processes. A key role for the HIV vpu proteins is the downregulation of CD4 by targeting newly synthesized CD4 molecules in the ER and mediating its proteosomal degradation. This process is critical for the virus as CD4 expression on the cell surface interferes with HIV viral propagation.50 Short viral transmembrane proteins can also induce cell death. M2, the IAV viroporin, inhibits autophagosome degradation which compromises the survival of infected cells.51 Viruses of the paramyxovirus family encode short hydrophobic (SH) integral membrane proteins 44\u201360 aa long, which were shown to inhibit apoptosis.52, 53 Papillomaviruses encode e5 proteins, ranging in size from 40 to 85 aa long transmembrane oncoproteins.34 The well\u2010studied Bovine papillomavirus E5 protein induces stable transformation of cultured fibroblasts by strongly and specifically activating the platelet\u2010derived growth factor \u03b2 receptor (PDGF\u03b2\u2010R).

The translation of these two proteins is regulated by translation of two uORFs, which inhibit translation from the adjacent ORF35.

The HIV Vpr is 96 aa long, conserved between all HIV and SIV and important for viral replication. This small protein has been implicated in different processes during the viral life cycle, including reverse transcription, nuclear import of viral DNA in non\u2010dividing cells, induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.67 The PB1\u2010F2 \u223c90 aa long protein encoded by IAV localizes to mitochondria and also induces apoptosis.68 Intriguingly, this conserved protein is translated from a +1 reading frame of the PB1 transcript which encodes one of the polymerase subunits.68 In KSHV, a 3 kb polyadenylated RNA is transcribed from the opposite strand of the replication and transcription activator (RTA) encoding ORF50. It has been annotated as a non\u2010coding RNA following identification because no large ORF was found in the transcript.69 However, later this transcript was found to encode a 48 aa long peptide, designated viral small peptide 1 (vSP\u20101) which interacts with RTA and prevents its degradation through the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, facilitating the virus gene expression and lytic replication.70 A different example is the recent exciting discovery of a communication system in phages that relies on a small peptide secreted to the medium. A 43 aa long peptide is translated from the phage aimP locus and this sORF is then processed to form the mature short communication peptide.71 Significantly, homologs of the aimP gene as well as other components of this communication pathway were found in many other Bacillus phages demonstrating the prevalence of this system.",

            "text": "As discussed above ribosome profiling has great potential for depicting the full variety of translated ORFs and has been successfully applied to a number of viruses in the past few years. HCMV was the first virus to be analyzed by ribosome profiling and revealed numerous previously unidentified ORFs, a large number of which are sORFs.13 A class of uORFs located upstream of canonical ORFs were found, two of them were shown to downregulate translation efficiency of the downstream ORF using a reporter. Interestingly, changes in the 5\u2032 ends of these transcripts along infection led to inclusion of the uORFs in the transcripts, therefore reducing translation from these ORFs at late stages of infection. Translation of many other sORFs was demonstrated, initiating within known ORFs or encoded by distinct transcripts. Multiple sORFs were found to be translated from transcripts previously annotated as non\u2010coding, more than ten were translated from the long non\u2010coding RNA b2.7, four of which are highly conserved across different HCMV strains. Translation of two short proteins encoded by RNA1.2 and additional sORFs were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Intriguingly, initiation of translation from a near\u2010cognate codon was observed for both long and short ORFs. Similarly, in another DNA double stranded herpes virus, KSHV, ribosome profiling identified many uORFs which are widely spread in the KSHV genome.72 Significantly, 24 out of the 85 annotated genes contained 1\u20136 uORFs, encoding peptides consisting of <100 aa, translating either in or out of frame and in many cases from a non\u2010canonical start codon. The KSHV data also supported the existence and regulatory role of two uORFs previously described.57, 58 Ribosome profiling analysis was also done on the well characterized bacteriophage lambda during lysogeny and at different time points along the lytic process, revealing translation of tens of previously uncharacterized sORFs.73 In vaccinia virus (VACV), a prototype poxvirus, ribosome profiling revealed translation from 596 unannotated ORFs that add to the 162 annotated ORFs.74 Many of these novel ORFs are sORFs and include uORFs, truncated ORFs that resulted from translation initiation from non\u2010annotated initiation site, ORFs that result from frameshifting, and ORFs from regions annotated as non\u2010coding. In MHV, an RNA virus of the Coronavirus family, triplet phasing of the ribosome profiling data allowed precise determination of translated reading frames, revealing several translated sORFs upstream of, or within, annotated virus protein coding regions, some of which are conserved in different MHV strains.14 One of them, a previously reported uORF upstream of ORF161 was confirmed and furthermore, a potential role for it in temporal regulation of replication protein synthesis was suggested.",

Significantly, dissecting the variety of viral peptides produced during infection is important, as even the non\u2010functional peptides could be an important part of the immunological repertoire of the virus as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I bound peptides.

To explore if there is any selection for the immunogenicity of viral sORFs we used netMHC 4.0, which is an artificial neural network trained platform for predicting MHC class I binding affinities of peptides, based on their sequence.79, 80 The number of fragments that strongly bind MHC\u2010I (high binders) was counted for each ORF. To take into account the effect of the ORF length, we calculated the ratio between the number of high binders in each ORF and its random set as a function of its length. We calculated the spearmen correlation and although some specific sORFs showed deviation from the median of random sequences, we found no significant correlation (Figure 4), suggesting that MHC\u2010I presentation is not a dominating negative selection force for sORFs translation in these viruses.",

False detection of spurious ORFs as well as falsely missing real ORFs are bound to occur. The analyses presented above were performed on data from three ribosome profiling studies. These studies used similar experimental approaches to generate the libraries but different computational approaches to predict the translated ORFs. Stern\u2010Ginossar et al. and Arias et al. used a machine learning approach and the false negative rate was assessed as 13 and 36% for the HCMV and KSHV data, respectively and 1% false positive rate for the HCMV data.13, 72 Yang et al. used a rule\u2010based approach hence it is harder to assess the false discovery rate.74 We estimate that the use of different computational approaches in these studies has no major impact on the analyses we performed, however, further studies defining new viral sORFs will help to shed more light on the characteristics of these fascinating group of molecules.",

It has been demonstrated that translated sORFs have essential roles during viral infection, however, the overwhelming majority of them remain to be characterized. To date, biological roles have been assigned to a small fraction of the translation products that have been mapped and a huge amount of work remains to be done to prove their existence and elucidate their functions. The outstanding challenge is to discriminate between ORFs that provide regulatory or protein\u2010based functions to random translational events, and to identify their roles. Using sequence predictions, we show that viral sORFs are enriched for specific functional features, suggesting that some of these translation products may act at the protein level. Notably, differences between the functional enrichments we discovered in the different viruses can stem from genuine biological differences or may be due to variations in experimental approaches that were used to generate these datasets. Designing mutations that will distinguish between the function of the translated product and the act of translation itself and studying their phenotypic consequences could provide an important platform for future studies. Advancement in gene editing strategies and use of reporters provide powerful strategies to study the effects of mutating these translated regions and validating their expression.",
