            "text": "Elderly subjects, especially those with mental disorders, need to be considered more vulnerable than other individuals to the tragic effects of COVID-19 outbreak for the following reasons. First, the case-fatality rate and the proportion of deaths in aged individuals aged 65 or above is higher than other populations. 3 Moreover, elderly subjects were more likely to manifest medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer than younger subjects. A specific risk factor for poorer outcome in the elderly is the higher occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome which is an important predictor of fatal outcomes. 4 Additionally, individuals aged 65 or above may be cognitively impaired and more susceptible to the effects of stress and major depression than younger individuals. 5 The rapid transmission of COVID-19 infection as well as the higher case-fatality might exacerbate existing psychiatric disorders, and enhance the risk of new psychopathological episodes. In addition, elderly subjects usually suffer from lower social support and require long-term care due to existing disabilities; this may significantly enhance loneliness, despair and hopelessness which are independent predictors of suicide. Furthermore, older patients may be not adequately treated particularly in territories where the activities of mental health services are drastically restricted due to quarantine, and only a limited access to Internet services and smart phones is allowed. 6 Last but not least, prejudices and discrimination towards marginalized individuals such as aged subjects with mental disorders may be generally reinforced in situations of social crisis, fear, frustration, and uncertainty. Stigma is a relevant predictor of negative outcome and represents an important barrier to care, particularly when it coexists with social isolation.",

In order to manage infected patients with acute psychiatric conditions, the regional authorities established that all psychiatric hospitals dedicated specific beds or, alternatively, guaranteed the continuous support of psychiatric staff in medical settings. Specifically, we directly observed a rapidly growing request of psychiatric interventions in aged patients with COVID-19 infection due to the emergence of severe delirium (mainly hyperkinetic) which was reported in approximately 30% \u221250% of cases increasing with age, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. When compared with younger subjects, we found that subjects aged 65 or above with prolonged hospitalization in our hospital are more vulnerable to: 1) environmental factors (e.g., social isolation and distance from family members, stay in intensive/subintensive units, communication difficulties due to therapeutic devices); 2) individual factors (e.g., COVID-19 possible neurotropic properties, impairments in insight and cognitive dysfunctions, comorbid medical conditions, and use of multiple medications).",

We firmly believe that the management of older adults with psychiatric disorders really represents a major challenge in this difficult period. Unfortunately, inadequate attention has been provided for this vulnerable population while targeted interventions aimed to remove barriers to care need to be carefully planned.",
