DESIGN: Observational. SETTING: Thirty-three Boston-area LTCFs over a 3-year period. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of long-term care who had previously participated in a trial of vitamin E supplementation and had paired serum samples available for viral analysis. MEASUREMENTS: Viral antibody titers to eight respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus serotype three (PIV-3), PIV-2, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and coronaviruses 229E and OC43) were measured using enzyme immunoassay at baseline and 53 weeks. Infection was defined as a more than quadrupling of viral titers. Clinical data on respiratory illnesses were collected throughout the study period. RESULTS: A total of 617 persons were enrolled in the trial. Of these, 382 (62%) had sera available for viral analysis. A total of 204 viral infections were documented in 157 subjects. Serological responses to all eight viruses were documented, with hMPV (12.8%) and coronavirus 229E (10.5%) being the most common and PIV-2 (2.4%) the least common. The occurrence of bronchitis (P 5.007), pneumonia (P 5.02), and any lower respiratory tract infection (P 5.002) was significantly associated with having a viral diagnosis.

In the current study, 24 and 19 residents were diagnosed with influenza A and B, respectively. None of the subjects infected with influenza A showed antibody rises to influenza B, and vice versa, suggesting that antibody rises were not vaccine induced. In addition, vaccine effect was less likely, because serum samples were obtained 7 to 9 months after immunization, when vaccine induced antibody has typically decreased to near baseline. 22 Another limitation of serology for viral diagnosis is the inability to identify rhinovirus. Rhinovirus is a ubiquitous pathogen that has been shown to cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in nursing homes, but serological diagnosis is not possible, because multiple serotypes exist. 23 Because rhinoviruses are a frequent cause of the common cold, it is not surprising that no association was found between URI and serological viral diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 402, "end": 404, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 405, "end": 407, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 994, "end": 996, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1284, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Presently, there are limited data in elderly people on the newly described virus hMPV and its role as a cause of illness in LTCFs.

Walsh, MD, for his thoughtful review of the manuscript and the staff of the Metabolic Research Unit and Nutritional Evaluation Laboratory of Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University and the participating nursing homes for help in recruitment of subjects and analysis of blood micronutrients.Conflict of Interest: Dr. Falsey has received research grants from Sanofi-pasteur. She serves on the advisory board for Quidel Inc. and has consulted with Sanofipasteur, Glaxo-Smith Kline, Alnylam, Medimmune, and Merck and has received received honoraria. Dr. Hamer is on the speaker's bureau for Glaxo Smith Kline and owns shares of Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc., a company that makes respiratory diagnostics products. Dr. Meydani has funding in this area of study from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute on Aging (NIA), and Roche (for provision of the supplements for the study). This work was supported by NIA, National Institutes of Health Grant 1R01-AG13975 and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreement 58-1950-9-001. The study was also supported by HRCA/Harvard Research Nursing Home PO1 AG004390 to Dr. Lipsitz, which facilitated recruitment of subjects and conduct of the study at Hebrew Rehabilitation Center.Author Contributions: Dr. Falsey analyzed the viral data and wrote the manuscript. Dr. Dallal assisted with the analysis of data and reviewed and had a final say about the manuscript. Maria Formica and Gloria Andolina performed the viral assays and assisted with analysis of the viral data. Dr. Hamer was involved in the conceptualization of the study design, was responsible for data acquisition, and assisted with data interpretation and editing of the final manuscript. Lynette Leka was responsible for data acquisition. Dr. Meydani had full access to all of the data in the study and was responsible for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis, as well as its acquisition. Dr. Meydani was responsible for the study concept and design and interpretation of study findings and assisted in the drafting and final editing of the manuscript.Sponsor's Role: The sponsor provided the funding for the original vitamin E study but did not provide funds for virologic testing or analysis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"}]}
