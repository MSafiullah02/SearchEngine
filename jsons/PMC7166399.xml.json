Genome sequences of SARS\u2010CoV isolates obtained from a number of index patients have been published and have provided important information on the phylogeny and variability 3, 4.

Two representative catalytic motifs, 10\u201323 and 8\u201317 (Figure 1), were reported by Santoro and Joyce through in vitro selection from a combinatorial library of DNA sequences 8. The most efficient DNAzyme, termed \u201810\u201323\u2019, consists of a conserved catalytic core of 15 nucleotides, flanked by two variable hybridizing arms that can theoretically be designed to be complementary to any target RNA. It can cleave between any unpaired purine and a paired pyrimidine residue, which endow them with tremendous potential for applications in down\u2010regulation of targeted genes. To date, a number of groups have explored the potential of the 10\u201323 DNAzyme in biological systems. Banerjea and co\u2010workers have attempted to inhibit HIV\u20101 gene expression by DNAzymes targeted at the HIV\u20101 tar, gag, tat/rev RNA, and coreceptor CCR5 9, 10, 11, 12. Sun and co\u2010workers targeted the viral sequences from the HPV16 E6 and E7 genes 13 and the c\u2010myc gene in smooth muscle cells 14 by DNAzymes. The biological activity of DNAzymes that cleave RNA derived from the bcr\u2010abl, Egr\u20101, huntingtin, the env gene of HIV and PB2 mRNA of influenza virus A have also been examined 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
