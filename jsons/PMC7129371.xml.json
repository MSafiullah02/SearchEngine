The patient may cough, vomit, and breathe hard to produce a large number of droplets or aerosols, increasing the risk of cross-infection.

Early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine and isolation strategies of patients with COVID-19 can significantly prevent and control the transmission of the virus. By appropriately identifying the infected individuals and minimizing the transmission of the virus in the community, it is possible to effectively control the spread of infection. The early clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lack specificity, and its etiology is difficult to identify through computed tomography scans. Therefore, the handbook guide [1] suggests that the gold standard of diagnosing COVID-19 is real-time fluorescence-based real-time polymerase chain reaction of the upper respiratory tract samples (e.g., throat swab, nasal swab), lower respiratory tract samples (e.g., bronchial lavage, alveolar lavage), and blood or other samples. Currently, the nucleic acid testing of COVID-19 mainly involves the nasopharyngeal swabs.",

This can lead to small environmental contamination around the patient and is an important resource of nosocomial infection [4], largely increasing the risk of patient cross-infection and transmission to healthcare professionals. Air purification in the hospital is an important measure in the prevention and control of respiratory tract-transmitted diseases, specifically airborne diseases [5]. According to the requirements of the Hospital Air Purification Management Standard WS/T368-2012 (referred to as \u201cthe regulation\u201d below), locations with respiratory tract-transmitted disease patients can use negative pressure isolation rooms and install air purification systems. Therefore, our hospital designed and set up a special room under negative pressure for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with an air change rate of 12 times per hour. To prevent close contact between suspected cases and the sampling collector, a transparent acrylic board with two openings for sampling was set up to separate the two areas for them (Fig. 1\n). The room was installed with air disinfectors and ultraviolet air purifiers.",
