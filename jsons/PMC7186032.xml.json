Typically, public health professionals approach the surveillance or detection of a probable outbreak as an event for which all related data are dotted and analyzed in spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, the value of an IDI system is generally determined by the extent to which the system can present data and analysis results through intuitively comprehensible and cognitively efficient visualization. Ultimately, an IDI system must facilitate and enhance task performance by enabling public health professionals to use heuristics and preferred analysis methods to generate more accurate analysis results within a shorter time window.\n\n",

In Section IV, we summarize our findings and note that our data support most of the hypotheses tested.

As needed, these systems transmit WNV/botulism information through secure links to the BioPortal using mutually agreed protocols.

Technically speaking, we adopt a data warehousing approach, rather than alternative approaches such as query translation, information linkage, or terminology mapping [9] to address the distributed data integration challenges in IDI. This choice of approach is primarily based on the following characteristics of infectious disease data sources and associated analysis needs. First, unlike many other biomedical applications for which it has become increasingly easy to query data sources automatically from remote locations, most infectious disease data sets have been developed primarily for internal use. Although accessing the underlying databases through remote queries is technologically feasible, in practice, most IDI data providers are unwilling to \u201copen up\u201d their databases. Instead, they prefer pushing preprocessed data to (or preprocessing data waiting to be pulled by) a data warehousing system such as BioPortal while retaining full control over data fields to be shared (directly at the data level as opposed to at the data access control level). Second, the types of queries performed on IDI data sources typically are confined to data aggregation requests over particular geographical regions and time periods. Therefore, there is no need to strategize complex distributed queries. However, processing speed of the data aggregation is important because such operations must be carried out in large numbers for some outbreak detection analysis approaches (see Section II-C). Third, the amount of IDI data is relatively small in terms of storage volume because epidemiological information tends to contain a few short data fields, which makes a data warehousing approach feasible. Furthermore, overlaps between epidemiological data coverage are rare; therefore, the data warehousing effort becomes relatively manageable.",

In Section II-B, we provide the details of each component in more detail; here, we summarize BioPortal's implementation environment and the assumptions made on the user's end. BioPortal follows a standard three-tier web architecture. The data store component, developed using SQL Server, provides a data warehouse with information pulled from or pushed by contributing data sources. The communication backbone uses standard-compliant XML formats, and is built as multiple standalone Java applications that interface with various data sources using different messaging protocols. Most system functions are developed in Java using JSP pages to interact with the user. As such, all except one major component of BioPortal can be accessed by users through a standard Web browser. The exception is the visualization module, which is developed as a standalone Java application for improved performance, enhanced interactivity, and greater user interface control and is deployable through the Web Start technology (assuming that the Sun JRE environment is installed on the client machine).",

Typically, data from different organizations have different designs and are stored in different formats. To enable data interoperability, we use HL7 standards internally as the main storage format. Some data providers (e.g., New York state's HIN) have already adopted HL7 and can, thus, send HL7-compliant data to BioPortal directly. Additional steps are needed to ensure data interoperability for those data providers that do not yet have HL7-compliant data. First, we reach an agreement with them regarding the format (typically a simple home-grown XML format) for their data. Second, the data providers modify their data export module to implement this mutually agreed format. Third, when data from these providers reach BioPortal, a data normalization module maps the customized XML format on to HL7 using predetermined mapping rules implemented by the BioPortal team. In effect, the data from the HL7-compliant data providers also are processed by this module, because it removes from them unneeded data attributes, duplications, and common misspellings (based on a customized home-grown dictionary). This normalization module is not intended to resolve structural or semantic incompatibilities in an automated fashion; rather, it converts data to a predetermined format and performs shallow syntactic checking.",

When an underlying data set changes its data structure, a portal data store based on the consolidated database must be redesigned and reloaded to reflect the changes, which severely limits system scalability and extensibility. To alleviate potential computational performance problems with our XML-based design, we identify a core set of data fields based on the queries that are likely to be performed frequently. These fields are extracted from all XML messages and stored in a separate database table to enable fast retrieval.",

The third mechanism is cellular phone notification through an automated Web-based short text message interface for urgent alerts.",

Fig. 2 illustrates how these three views can be used to explore infectious disease data sets; the top left panel shows the GIS view. The user can select multiple data sets to be shown on the map in a layered manner using the checkboxes (e.g., disease cases, natural land features, land-use elements). The top-right panel corresponds to the timeline view and displays the occurrences of various cases using a Gantt chart-like display. The user can also access case details easily using the tree display located to the left of the timeline display. Below the timeline view is the periodic view with which the user can identify periodic temporal patterns (e.g., months with an unusually high number of cases). The bottom portion of the interface allows the user to specify subsets of data to be displayed and analyzed.\n\n",

In recent years, interest has increased in answering several central questions, which have great practical importance in outbreak detection and arise from spatial\u2013temporal data analysis and related predictive modeling: How can areas with exceptionally high or low measures be identified? How can observers determine whether unusual measures can be attributed to known random variations or are statistically significant? In the latter case, how should the explanatory factors be assessed? How can statistically significant changes be identified in a timely manner in specific geographic areas?

As a result, when the real underlying clusters do not conform to such shapes, the identified regions are often poorly localized. To overcome this major computational limitation, as part of the BioPortal technical research effort, we have developed an alternative and complementary modeling approach called risk-adjusted support vector clustering (RSVC). Hotspot analysis differs from standard clustering in that clustering must be performed relative to baseline data points (representing a \u201cnormal\u201d situation). In RSVC, we apply the \u201crisk adjustment\u201d concept from a crime hotspot analysis approach [12] to incorporate baseline information in the clustering process. The basic intuition behind RSVC is as follows: A robust, SVM-based clustering mechanism called support vector clustering allows detection of clusters with arbitrary shapes based on the distances defined over pairs of data points. By adjusting distance measures proportionally to the estimated density of the baseline factor, areas with high baseline density make it more difficult to group data points together as clusters, because the distances between these data points have been adjusted upward. We have also extended our RSVC approach to perform prospective hotspot analysis aimed at monitoring data sources on a continuous basis. For technical details of this BioPortal spatial\u2013temporal data analysis work, interested readers are referred to [13] and [14].",

We adopted the QUIS instrument [19] with a nine-point Likert scale to evaluate system usability. 11Details of the scale used in QUIS are available in [19]. In general, lower scores represent more favorable usability assessments (e.g., easy, wonderful, clear) than higher scores (e.g., difficult, terrible, confusing), with one being most favorable and nine being the most unfavorable.",

We provided each subject with an overview of his or her assigned system and a training session based on sample tasks to illustrate how to use that system. In the experiment, each subject was asked to complete all analysis tasks grouped by analysis scenario and sequenced in increasing complexity, i.e., tasks progressing from low to high complexity. After completing all the tasks, each subject had to complete a questionnaire survey to provide his or her assessment of the system's usability, usefulness, and ease of use, as well as his or her satisfaction with the information support by the system.
