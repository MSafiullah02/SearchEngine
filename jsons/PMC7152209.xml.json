Furthermore, Ministry of Culture and Tourism MCT, 2003) have claimed that the 2002 Football World Cup and the 2002 Busan Asian Games also boosted South Koreans\u2019 self-confidence and pride, and helped further develop tour products and infrastructures. For example, in 1965 South Korea had only 37 hotels with 1837 rooms (Hall, 1997a; Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Korea National Tourism Corporation (KNTC) ( = former Korea National Tourism Organisation (KNTO)), 1980) compared to 127 hotels with 19,296 rooms in 1981. At the time of the 1988 Olympics 265 hotels accounted for a total of 33,189 rooms (Chon and Shin, 1990). In the year of the World Cup, there were 526 hotels, which provided 55,579 rooms. This number had increased by 6.7% for hotels and 4.8% for rooms from the year 2001 (when there were 493 hotels and 53,017 rooms in South Korea). By 2005, this figure had increased to 558 hotels with a total of 58,950 rooms (MCT and KNTO, 2006). The increased interest in South Korea from foreign tourists, and greater leisure time and disposable income for South Koreans has also corresponded with this growth in accommodation (Chon and Shin, 1990; Hall, 1997a; MCT, 2003).",

Furthermore, there has been a tendency to focus on assessing the economic impacts of events in an extemporal context with relatively little attention having been given to the event as part of a broader longitudinal process (Crompton and McKay, 1994; Crompton et al., 2001; Delpy and Li, 1998; Hall, 1992; Hiller, 1998; Mitchell and Wall, 1986; Marsh, 1984). Political/administrative impacts as well as the social/cultural and psychological/perceptual impacts of events are among the least studied of the six potential impacts identified in the literature (Hall, 1992; Shultis et al., 1996).",

Events have also been recognised for their role in highlighting the international profile and increased awareness of the host country or region (Deccio and Baloglu, 2002; Jeong and Faulkner, 1996; Ritchie and Smith, 1991), and improving the host community's quality of life (Deccio and Baloglu, 2002; Goeldner and Long, 1987). Hall (1989) indicated that a mega-event has the power to strengthen regional values and traditions and even lead to cultural understanding among visitors and residents. Increased long- and short-term employment opportunities are one of the perceived benefits of holding a mega-event (Deccio and Balcoglu, 2002; Hall, 1989; Jeong and Faulkner, 1996; Ritchie and Lyons, 1990).",

It also increases tax burdens, and mismanagement of public funds by organisers in host communities (Ritchie and Aitken, 1984). Specifically on the issue of housing, local tenants have to live with the mega-event prices which are relevant to the Seoul case of post-Olympics in Seoul (McKay and Plumb, 2001). Traffic congestion, increased crime, overcrowding and environmental damage are also potential negative impacts (Deccio and Balcoglu, 2002; Hall, 1992; Mihalik and Cummings 1995; Ritchie, 1984). In addition, employment opportunities could be limited due to the short-term nature/season of the mega-event (Burgan and Mules, 1992; Wang and Gitelson, 1988). In other words, events generally produce positive impacts for some, and negative effects for others (Getz, 2004; Hall, 1992).",

Secondly, hotels provide the largest number of jobs, generate the greatest multiplier effect outside the industry and are major foreign currency earners (Kim and Uysal, 1998). Thirdly, in order to bid for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, one of FIFA's requirements of the host country to have compliance with under FIFA's stipulation was secure accommodation for the FIFA's family and delegation (Lee, 2000; WCOIA, 1995). Fourthly, it has been claimed that the hotel sector is the most affected by events due to the direct impact of event related visitor arrivals and the resulting demand for short-term accommodation (Dwyer et al., 2006; McKay and Plumb, 2001). Finally, little research has been specifically undertaken on the perspectives of the hotel sector on the hosting of mega-events (Shultis et al., 1996; Byeon, 2002; Byeon and Hall, 2003; Byeon, 2008).",

The questionnaire was first draughted in English and then translated into Korean by the researcher, who is Korean. The questionnaire was designed to identify the Korean hotel industry's perspective on the positive and negative aspects of the Football World Cup 2002 on their individual hotel. A five-point Likert scale ranging from \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 (1) to \u2018strongly agree\u2019 (5) was used to rate 24 impact variables of the 2002 Football World Cup for the pre-event impacts study. However, when present results, percentage of \u2018strongly agree\u2019 and \u2018agree\u2019 were combined as \u2018agree\u2019 and \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 and \u2018disagree\u2019 were joined as \u2018disagree\u2019. Alreck & Settle (1995), Alreck & Settle (2004) noted that scales are used to obtain responses which will be comparable to one another and may be regarded as both efficient and practical. Twenty-four impact variables were generated from a combination of several sources of information including Ritchie's (1984) article concerning the analysis of the impact of hallmark events, Hall's (1992) hallmark tourist events book and a review of the Seoul Olympics by Jeong (1987), Jeong (1992). Table 5.1\npresents 24 pre-event impact study's variables. To make a comparison between the two points in time, including total 24 impact variables of the pre-event impacts study and adding 3 more impact variables which derived from limitation of pre-event impacts study were used to rate. Thus, a total of 27 impact variables were used in the post-event impacts study (see Table 5.2\n).",

Pilot testing was required so that the survey could be modified slightly in content and in structure, and to ensure that mail surveying would do the job reliably (Alreck & Settle (1995), Alreck & Settle (2004)). Thus, the questionnaire was pilot tested on 15 hotels in South Korea. Since a high response rate was expected from pilot testing, mainly deluxe 1st and 2nd class and first class hotels in 10 HCs were randomly chosen for the pilot test. The results of this research did indeed confirm that deluxe 1st and 2nd class and first class hotels presented high response rates compared with the other hotel classes. The pilot test recorded a 60% (n = 9) result, so no amendments were found to be necessary. While conducting the actual survey a few more questionnaires were returned from the pilot survey.

Even though, judged by mean score, the hotel sector perceived that it did not receive benefit from the co-hosted 2002 World Cup. This consistent finding in both the pre- and post-event study supports previous literature that resulting events brings international visitors to the country (Hall, 1992; Ritchie, 1984) thus increased international guests to the hotel sector (Dwyer et al., 2006). However, there were also domestic guests displacement occurred during the event. This result indicates that domestic guests probably stayed away during the World Cup because of a possible perception that the event would be marked by inflated prices, crowds and difficulties in finding accommodation. Regular tourists can be displaced when events take up available accommodation (Getz, 2004).\n",

Since the 11 September terror in 2001, visitor numbers to South Korea already decreased which was a global phenomenon (e.g. in the Asia Pacific region international arrivals decreased by 7.4% in 2001) (MCT and KNTO, 2002; MINTeL International Group, 2002; WTTC, 2002). In addition after the World Cup in 2003 the tourism industry experienced a decrease in international arrivals due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the war in Iraq (MCT and KNTO, 2004). Global circumstances were not good for South Korea utilising co-hosted Football event to increase international visitors to South Korea before, during and after the World Cup. Specifically, during the World Cup periods in June 2002 a total of 403,466 visitors travelled to South Korea, a decrease of 12.4% over 2001 (460,330) (MCT and KNTO, 2002). A main cause of the decrease was the declining number of Japanese tourists by 45% who used to account for 46% of the total inbound travellers (MCT, 2003).",

This is evidence that prior to the games the hotel sector mispredicted the impact of the hosted World Cup. There were many other causes for the decrease of inbound travellers. One of South Korea's major inbound markets, the USA, remains uncertain in the overall economic environment. The most numerous visitors to South Korea, Japan, were in the throes of yet another recession (MINTeL International Group, 2002). Moreover, because of the co-hosted World Cup with Japan, benefits may have been split and the inspiring performance of its soccer team held them watching at home. The rise of travel costs in Korea including the hotel room prices also played a role to make them hesitate to come to South Korea (MCT, 2003). Chinese tourists to South Korea for the event were held back to generate a mere 60,000 decrease from the expected maximum 100,000 due to Chinese travel agents requiring excessive deposit money for returning home (scales from 5 million won up to 10 million won) and the poor performance of the Chinese soccer team (3 defeats in a row with no goals).",

Both of these areas are under researched in the event literature. This longitudinal study revealed that the hotel sector's expectation of the benefits from the co-hosted World Cup was higher before the event but reality was not satisfied as they expected. However, deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels and HCs received benefits from the hosted World Cup the results of which this longitudinal study answered the question of who gets benefit from the hosted sport event even though hotel sector's high expectation was not satisfied in the reality of the games.",

Thus, from the largest of mega-events through to the smallest non-profit event, the perspective of many stakeholders must be considered. Different planning and policies are thus required to suit different hallmark events in order to maximise benefits and minimise or ameliorate costs and negative impacts. Therefore, on-going monitoring is also required to better manage impacts generated from hallmark events (Hall, 1992).",
