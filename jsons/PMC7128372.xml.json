Significant antigenic and pathogenic differences have been reported between and within genotypes (Stadejek et al., 2006, Stadejek et al., 2008, Darwich et al., 2011), correlated with a lack of cross-protection by vaccines (Geldhof et al., 2012). Highly pathogenic strains of PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) have been identified within both genotypes (Xiao et al., 2010, Hu et al., 2012).",

PIMs are found within the pulmonary capillaries, adherent to endothelial cells; they remove foreign particles from the blood and are able to migrate to sites of injury. PIMs release pro-inflammatory mediators, such as metabolites of arachidonic acid and cytokines that modulate pulmonary microvascular physiology (Bertram et al., 1988, Chitko-McKown et al., 1991, Carrasco et al., 2002).",

Whereas PRRSV replicates mainly in PAMs, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been observed mainly in septal macrophages, pointing to different roles of PAMs and septal macrophages in PRRS. The main function of PAMs is to provide the first line of phagocytic defence against microbial invasion (Cheung et al., 2000, De Baere et al., 2012). Septal macrophages, which mostly are activated indirectly by the replication of PRRSV in bystander cells, may modulate local inflammatory and immune responses through secretion of cytokines (G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010b).

Concomitant infections with PRRSV and swine influenza virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or PCV2 are common. More severe clinical signs and growth retardation occur in co-infected pigs than in pigs infected with PRRSV alone (Van Reeth et al., 1996, Harms et al., 2001, Jung et al., 2009, Renukaradhya et al., 2010, Opriessnig et al., 2011). In pigs dually infected with PRRSV and PRCV, exacerbation of clinical signs is associated with an impaired innate immune response in the lungs, specifically a decrease in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity due to decreased expression of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1. The adaptive immune response is also impaired, leading to enhanced apoptosis of PAMs as a consequence of increased concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 (Jung et al., 2009, Renukaradhya et al., 2010).",

Enhanced expression of these molecules in the lungs increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection. Although there is upregulation of CD14 in PRRSV-infected septal macrophages and PAMs, most CD14 enhancement in the lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs is probably due to infiltration of CD14-positive monocytes into the pulmonary interstitium; these may later differentiate into septal macrophages (Van Gucht et al., 2005, Qiao et al., 2011). PRRSV and bacterial endotoxin act synergistically to amplify the inflammatory response of infected macrophages (Qiao et al., 2011). Higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is observed in septal macrophages of PRRSV-infected pigs (G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010b). These findings suggest a role for septal macrophages in the immunopathogenesis of secondary bacterial infections in PRRS through upregulation of CD14 and activation of a cytokine cascade (Fig. 2).",

Low expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, both at mRNA and protein levels, has been reported in pigs infected with PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2001, G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010c, Renukaradhya et al., 2010, Garc\u00eda-Nicol\u00e1s et al., 2011). This may be related to the typically mild respiratory and systemic clinical signs in experimental PRRSV infections, in which absence of fever is correlated with development of more severe interstitial pneumonia (Van Reeth et al., 1999, Van Gucht et al., 2003, G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2009). There appears to be a correlation between the virulence of the PRRSV strain, the severity of clinical signs and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines; in pigs infected with HP-PRRSV, marked inappetence and severe respiratory signs are related to severe interstitial pneumonia and high levels of expression of IL-1\u03b1 in the lungs in comparison with other classical PRRSV strains (Amarilla et al., 2012, Hu et al., 2012).

The lack of substantial changes in serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines may reflect a strategy by which PRRSV evades the host immune response. Therefore, samples of blood and/or serum do not necessarily reflect the events occurring in lungs of PRRSV-infected animals at a given time, although these are very accessible samples.",

TNF-\u03b1 plays an important role in the inflammatory response; this cytokine may act as an antiviral cytokine, protecting cells from infection against viruses or enhancing selective elimination of virus-infected cells through an IFN-independent mechanism. Recombinant porcine TNF-\u03b1 inhibits PRRSV replication in vitro and PRRSV-infected PAMs have reduced expression of TNF-\u03b1 (L\u00f3pez-Fuertes et al., 2000). Several PRRSV strains are weak inducers of TNF-\u03b1 and also impair TNF-\u03b1 production by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway; this mechanism may contribute to the virulence of HP-PRRSV (Hou et al., 2012). Promoter and post-transcriptional downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 has been associated with PRRSV non-structural proteins (NSPs) 1\u03b1, 1\u03b2 and 2 (Chen et al., 2010, Subramaniam et al., 2010, Subramaniam et al., 2012, Darwich et al., 2011). Specific amino acid residues of NSP1\u03b1 and NSP1\u03b2 have been identified that affect TNF-\u03b1 promoter activity; substitution of specific NSP1\u03b2 amino acids is potential tool for the generation of attenuated PRRSV vaccines (Subramaniam et al., 2012). The limited expression of TNF-\u03b1 in experimental infections with some PRRSV strains may be a mechanism by which these strains impair the host immune response and prevent viral clearance (Table 1; Fig. 1\n).",

There is a significant correlation between PRRSV antigen expression and the expression of regulatory cytokines, such IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, in the lungs, but not in the lymphoid organs, of infected pigs (Barranco et al., 2012, G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010b, G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2012a). One hypothesis suggested by these findings is that cells recruited to the pulmonary parenchyma are modulated to secrete IL-10 and/or TGF-\u03b2, among other immune mediators. An alternative hypothesis is that the expression of regulatory cytokines plays a key role in the modulation of the inflammatory response within the lung, reducing infiltration and proliferation of inflammatory cells (Spight et al., 2005, Charavaryamath et al., 2006, Backus et al., 2010).",

Expression of regulatory cytokines by different subsets of lung macrophages may impair bacterial killing by PAMs and PIMs, as well reduce the efficiency of the local host immune response by septal macrophages. Production of TGF-\u03b2 occurs in recall responses to some PRRSV-1 strains and is more marked after homologous reinfection, suggesting the presence of TGF-\u03b2 producing T cell clones dependent on the PRRSV strain (D\u00edaz et al., 2012).",

Expression of CD163 is upregulated by IL-10 and IL-6, promoting PRRSV entry and replication, but downregulated by TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (Buechler et al., 2000, Sulahian et al., 2000, Pioli et al., 2004, Weaver et al., 2007, Patton et al., 2009).

PRRSV decreases the bactericidal activity of macrophages, resulting in increased susceptibility to secondary infections. The variability in cytokine profiles induced by different PRRSV strains, as well as the emergence of HP-PRRSV in Asia and Eastern Europe, highlight the need to evaluate differences in immunobiology among PRRSV strains. PRRSV is able to modulate the immune response by increasing the expression of Hp in the early stages of infection, which may interact with the viral receptor CD163 and induce the synthesis of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-10. There is a need for improved knowledge of the immune response in PRRSV infections in order to improve the efficacy of vaccines to control PRRS.",
