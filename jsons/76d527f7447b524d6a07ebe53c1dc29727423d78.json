By mid-March, a shelter-in-place order was Suddenly, PubMed and UpToDate no longer had the answers. I turned to Twitter discussions, where STEMI protocols developed by doctors in China started circulating. Upon first glance, they seemed thrombolytic heavy. But only weeks later, after the cases in the United States had swelled to more than 300,000, with almost 10,000 deaths (4) we recognized the rationale. Our new hospital STEMI policy, which would normally require approval from multiple layers of bureaucracy, now came down to my \"expert\" opinion. I had to lean on the experience of doctors who did not even speak the same language as me, who quickly became colleagues through ACC webinars (5).",

From inside make-shift parking lot tents to the cath lab, we shared our experiences as young doctors on the frontlines and supported each other through our biggest fears. While our response to COVID-19 required social isolation, in reality, it was bringing us together in unprecedented ways. We worked together to reduce our personal risk, find work life balance, keep up with education, and innovate to find solutions for this battle that had only just begun.",

I watched a YouTube video of a Chinese nurse teaching donning and doffing to learn how, which only made me realize how woefully ill-equipped we were. Especially since I had been designated the \"COVID-19 interventionalist\" in efforts to minimize staff exposures, I recognized the substantial risk I would encounter without adequate PPE. I heard reports that Italian cardiologists suffered the highest COVID-19 rates of all doctors, likely due to low PPE use with cardiac patients lacking typical COVID-19 symptoms (6) . With fewer procedures, the cath lab nursing station became a craft studio, where nurses used tape to create makeshift PPE for our team -with no idea about efficacy. Twitter feeds like #GetMePPE started. My son's elementary school started a mask donation bin for our hospital, and my gradeschool friend collected masks from 2019 California wildfire survivors.",

It quickly became clear that working from home while watching a 2-, 4-, and 6-year-old was impossible. Some of my peers have a stay-at-home spouse, but many were reliant on daycares that closed. The university wellness program emailed us about backup childcare, with a website and phone number that did not work. I finally gave up when I found out their primary placements were at in-home daycares -a scenario that did not seem safe given CDC orders to not convene in groups more than 10 (8). We reluctantly called my parents to come stay with us to help watch the kids, and we are eternally grateful for their help. But at close to 80 years old, they could suffer a 10% risk of death if they contracted the virus (9).

All courses, conferences, seminars, grand rounds and other educational activities moved online. Our first cardiology grand rounds by Zoom was on a non-COVID19 topic. At first it seemed strange to be talking about anything except the looming battle in front of us, but it turned out to be a refreshing hour without the \"c-word\" and a reminder that one day, a world beyond this would be waiting for us. Our second grand rounds online focused on the topic of cardiovascular complications of COVID-19, with the highest attendance in the history of our program, including participants from multiple states across the country dialing in. And while grand rounds is usually reserved for world-renowned experts, this joint session was delivered by fellows and faculty alike -whoever had good information about this novel virus was worthy of the podium.",

Our current fellows will not achieve close to the numbers they need, and in the case of procedures, hands-on experience cannot be replaced. Yet it seems unfair to require longer training due to the pandemic. Beyond the cath lab, volumes of all procedures and imaging are down as well. How will the fellows reach their Core Cardiology Training Statement (COCATS) requirements? How will they concentrate on preparing for ABIM exams, while now also watching their children at home, and fighting the burnout of a war that puts their lives at risk everyday?",
