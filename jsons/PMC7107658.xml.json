The Pneumocystis genomes sequenced to date have all demonstrated a contracted genome compared to those of other closely related fungi, revealing adaptative mechanisms to live exclusively in mammalian hosts, very similar to a parasite/host relationship.6,7",

Cats receiving renal transplants, for example, have never developed PCP despite being susceptible to numerous other opportunistic pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptococcus neoformans/ Cryptococcus gattii because of prednisone and cyclosporine administration.15 PCP can, however, be produced in contrived experimental settings.16",

There was no evidence of symptomatic PCP in these cats, which therefore were considered to be colonized or infected subclinically. Later, a small number of studies investigated cats as potential animal models for Pneumocystis infection, probably drawing upon the notion that cats might be susceptible to recrudescent Pneumocystis infection, as they are to toxoplasmosis following reactivation of Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoite cysts. In these studies, cats were administered extremely high doses of corticosteroids, and as a result, a proportion of them developed PCP pneumonia16,20 (Table 1).",

In the mtLSU rRNA tree, the ST LSU-L1 grouped in the clades isolated from the Artyodactila, while LSU-L2 was grouped with the Carnivora clade, showing greater similarity to dog Pneumocystis than ferret Pneumocystis (Fig. 3). In both mtSSU rRNA and mtLSU rRNA dendrograms, Carnivora and Artyodactila were paraphyletic and well separated from primate and rodent clades, used as outgroups.

Thus, the natural route for transmission of Pneumocystis is most likely queen (mother) to kitten, and this would impact on the evolution of Pneumocystis in cats.

The same is true also for macrobats, where, for example, Histoplasma capsulatum coexists with Pneumocystis spp. in many individuals.45 In contrast, in pigs there seems to be a general tendency that concurrent viral and bacterial infections are less frequently observed in Pneumocystis-positive cases than in Pneumocystis-negative individuals.29 A negative association between the presence of P. jirovecii and bacterial colonization was also shown in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.46 Thus, which factor(s) trigger multiplication of trophic forms and whether a simple infection with Pneumocystis (without the presence of other infectious agents) can induce lung injury and dysfunction appears to be unique in different host-environment-pathogen systems.",

In one study of FeLV-infected cats, acute bronchopneumonia, leukemic infiltrates, interstitial pneumonitis, and adenomatosis were all observed13 (Table 1), but despite a concerted search, there was no microscopic evidence for Pneumocystis infection. These findings suggested that Pneumocystis is not commonly a complication of FeLV infection, nor a cause of lethal interstitial pneumonia in cats13 (Table 1). Along similar lines, FIV is a very well-studied lentivirus of cats, and despite great scrutiny in both experimental and naturally occurring settings, no association has ever been made between development of PCP and long-standing FIV infection in cats with greatly reduced numbers of circulating CD4 cells.14",

As in humans, young cats seem more likely to be Pneumocystis-positive, but no other factors (sex, lifestyle, cause of death, etc.) in this study were associated with colonized cats. In experimental animal model studies, cats have been shown to be less susceptible to Pneumocystis infection when compared with rodents28 (Table 1). Indeed, corticosteroid treated cats generally developed only a mild Pneumocystis infection, in marked contradistinction with the heavy symptomatic PCP that developed in corticosteroid treated rats,28 suggesting that cats are less susceptible to Pneumocystis disease than other mammals. Without evidence of Pneumocystis in a specimen (BAL or lung biopsy) from a cat with respiratory distress and radiological findings consistent with PCP, we cannot confirm or deny any role for Pneumocystis in the pathogenesis of feline lung disease. In addition, modern metagenomics tools open the possibility to hypothesize that the presence/absence of Pneumocystis might be affected not only by the microbiota of lungs, but also of intestinal microbial community interfering in metabolic pathways,46,48,49 a field of research yet to be well explored in veterinary patients.",
