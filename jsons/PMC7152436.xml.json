            "text": "\nSince the last few decades, nanostructured materials (NsM) have been explored and investigated curiously worldwide in various applications including energy and environmental. NsM could be defined as the solids composed of structural elements\u2014mostly crystallites\u2014with a characteristic size (in at least one direction) of a few nanometers (1\u2013100 nm). These materials exhibit outstanding and often superior physical and chemical properties compared with their bulk counterpart because of different chemical composition, arrangement of the atoms, and size. The growth of NsM in one, two, and three dimensions generates new interesting properties, which remarkably enhanced functions for device fabrication in various fields, including energy, medical, biological, opto-electronics, optics, magnetic, electronic, and many others. Particularly, metal and metal oxide nanostructures have been studied potentially due to their high specific surface to volume ratio, showed quantum size effect, properties can be controlled just adjusting shape and size and high interfacial reactivity. NsM could be classified into four types\u2014zero: clusters of any aspect ratio from 1 to \u221e; one: multilayers; two: ultrafine-grained overlayers or buried layers; and three: nanophase materials depend on their dimensional grain growth (Figure 2.1\n). The properties of NsM are examined by their size distribution, shape, chemical composition and interfacial reactivity, and type of grains present at the interfaces [1]. The change in the size makes these materials have different electronic changes in terms of energy and number of levels. This makes these materials behave electronically different. The origin of the size-induced properties in nanomaterials depends basically on the surface phenomena (extrinsic contribution) and quantum confinement effects (intrinsic contribution). This chapter gives a detailed summary about NsM and their outstanding properties [2].\n",

Let us consider a sphere of radius \u201cr,\u201d surface area, and volume of sphere given in (2.1), (2.2). The ratio of these two equations gives Eq. (2.3), which indicates the increase in surface to volume ratio with decrease in size of materials. Thus, when the radius of the sphere decreases, its surface area to volume ratio increases [3], [4]. Figure 2.2\nshows the relation between surface area and size of silica nanoparticles. It is seen that obtained surface area increased exponentially below 100 nm indicated crucial role of size in NsM. If a bulk material is subdivided into an ensemble of individual nanomaterials, the total volume remains the same, but the collective surface area is greatly increased.(2.1)ItssurfaceareaA=4\u03c0r2\n(2.2)ItsvolumeV=(43)\u03c0r3\n(2.3)SurfaceareatoitsvolumeratioAV=3r\n",

These effects also differ in the range of sizes in which they appear. Size effects are observed in semiconductor crystals measuring 10\u2013100 nm, whereas quantum size effects are usually characteristic of nanocrystallites measuring less than 10 nm. In the literature semiconductor nanoparticles in which quantum size effects of one type or another appear, are often called quantum size particles or quantum points to emphasize their special electronic structure. It is necessary to mention the tentative nature of the classification in so far as the exact \u201ccritical\u201d size after which the appearance of quantum size effects can be expected is largely determined by the chemical nature of the semiconductor and can vary from 0.5 (CuCl) to 46 (PbSe) or more nanometers. From the positions of quantum mechanics the \u201ccritical\u201d size (the threshold for the appearance of quantum size effects) corresponds to the De Broglie wavelength of the free electron. During analysis of the interband absorption of the semiconductor nanoparticle the Bohr radius of the exciton (a\nB), which can be calculated from the electrophysical constants of the bulk semiconductor, can be used as such a criterion [6]. The data that have accumulated on size effects in semiconductor nanoparticles make it possible to examine them according to the nature of the effect on the properties of the nanocrystals.",

The value of Ry* in the third term is called the Rydberg energy of the exciton and takes account of the correlation between the motion of the electron and the hole. As seen, the last two terms in Eq.

It dips slightly around 400\u2013500 nm, and when held up to the light, such a thin film appears blue due to the weak transmission of light in this wavelength range [8]. However, the dilute gold colloid film displays total transparency at low photon energies (below 1.8 eV). Its absorption becomes intense in a sharp band around 2.3 eV (520 nm). This kind of effect is known as surface plasmon, which is aroused from small size of metal particles [9]. Besides quantum size effects, the NsM behavior is different due to surface effects, which dominate as nanocrystal size decreases. Reducing the size of a crystal from 30 to 3 nm, the number of atoms on its surface increases from 5% to 50% beginning to perturb the periodicity of the \u201cinfinite\u201d lattice. In that sense, atoms at the surface have fewer direct neighbors than atoms in the bulk and as a result they are less stabilized than bulk atoms. The origin of the quantum size effects strongly depends on the type of bonding in the crystal [10].",

The relevant length scale is the de Broglie wavelength, \u03bb\ndB, of an electron in one particular direction: If the dimension of the system in one dimension is lower than \u03bb\ndB we call it a two-dimensional (2D) system. Graphene sheet obtained from exfoliation of graphite is the best example of a 2D system as well as semiconductor superlattices. One-dimensional (1D) system is obtained when two dimensions are lower than \u03bb\ndB values; nanowires and nanotubes belong to this category [11]. Special is the case of the so-called quantum dots whose all three dimensions are lower than \u03bb\ndB and we name these as 0D systems. Their energy spectra are discrete and the system can be viewed as an artificial atom. This has a tremendous effect on optical properties of nanoparticles, as the absorption shifts from the infrared to the visible range.

If a magnetic field H is applied, the magnetization of all domains takes the direction of the field and remains in this direction even if the outside field is removed. If the size of ferromagnetic nanoparticles becomes smaller than the critical domain size (10\u201320 nm), only one domain remains in the particle (Figure 2.5b). If again a magnetic field is applied, all particles will align according to this field (Figure 2.5c), but if the field is removed, thermal motion will lead to a loss of orientation (Figure 2.5d). This behavior is similar to that of permanent magnetic dipoles in a paramagnet and is thus called superparamagnetism [12]. This effect sets, among others, an upper limit to the miniaturization of magnetic memories. On the other hand, superparamagnetic particles are envisioned to play an important role in nanobiotechnology and medicine. Another magnetic nanoeffect, which is used presently in magnetic memories, is the so-called giant magnetoresistive effect [13].

From the perspective of applications, these structures have wide-ranging utility in areas as diverse as catalysis, energy storage, fiber engineering, fuel cells, biomedicine, computation, power generation, photonics, pollution remediation, and gas sensing. There are few basic parameters, such as synthesis cost, use of nontoxic chemicals, maximum use of aqueous solvents, minimum number of reagents and few steps with high yield, room or low temperature and high efficiency, which needs to be considered during fabrication of advanced devices based on NsM. Nowadays synthesis of new NsM using chemical methods have focused greatly because of low temperature and cost with better functions for environmental and energy applications. The synthesis of NsM is an interesting research field. Until now, a large number of approaches have been explored to synthesize NsM, which could be divided into two major sections, that is, top-down and bottom-up. Interestingly, bottom-up route based on chemistry have attracted considerable attention because of relatively low cost and high yield [14]. In this process, material growth started from atom to atom, molecule by molecule. Recently, a number of techniques, including coprecipitation, sol\u2013gel processes, microemulsions, freeze drying, hydrothermal processes, laser pyrolysis, ultrasound and microwave irradiation, templates, and chemical vapor deposition, have been developed to control the growth, size, morphology, and uniformity of NsM [15]. Therefore, in this section, we will study in brief about heterogeneous photocatalysts fabricated using selective bottom-up approaches for improved photocatalytic activity.",

To drive water redox reactions, these carriers need to reach the material interfaces at the electrolyte and at the back contact. In the absence of an external field, charge carriers move by diffusion and their range is defined by the mean free diffusion length L. The parameter L depends on the carrier diffusion constant D and the carrier lifetime \u03c4 (Eq. (2.5)), and a dimensionality factor (q = 2, 4, 6 for 1, 2, or 3D diffusion).(2.5)L\u00af2=qD\u03c4\n",

Upon doping NsM, the concentration of the majority carriers increases, and with it their \u03c4 and L values. On the contrary, the lifetime and diffusion length of the minority carriers decrease [16]. For optimum collection of both carrier types at the back contact, the semiconductor film thickness d has to be in the same range as L\ne and L\nh (Figure 2.6\n). To improve minority carrier collection at the semiconductor\u2013electrolyte interface, the surface roughness of the film can be increased. This surface nanostructuring approach is particularly useful for first row transition metal oxides (MnO2, Fe2O3), which suffer from low hole mobility and lifetimes [17]. Ideal electron/hole collection is possible with suspended nanoparticles, if their particle size d < L\ne, L\np. Although in this situation, both carrier types need to be extracted at the sc\u2013electrolyte interface. Thus, there is a need for selective redox agents. This has been referred to by Helmut Tributsch as kinetic rectification [18].",

A variety of applications ranging from anti-fogging, anti-microbial, and self-cleaning surfaces, through to water and air purification and solar-induced hydrogen production, have been developed and many of these have made their way into commercial products. However, extensive research continues to further optimize this technology and to widen the spectrum of potential applications. Research and application foci include anti-stick or anti-fingerprint coatings, soil repellency, and decomposition of organic matter, such as microbes or fat. When exposed to light certain semiconducting materials such as \u201cphotocatalysts\u201d trigger or accelerate chemical reactions resulting, for example, in a decomposition of organic molecules [24]. Due to their large surface area, nanosized catalyst particles show a significantly enhanced reactivity compared to larger particles or bulk material. Numerous materials are under examination; however, none appear to match the efficiency of TiO2. Its application requires illumination in the UV or at the extreme blue edge of the visible spectrum. Volume applications are thus mainly limited to the outdoor area [25]. However, despite the reduced natural illumination, even indoor products such as sanitary ceramics are being increasingly applied. Moreover, research is underway to widen the exploitable spectral range toward visible light. A few applications of photocatalysis are provided in Figure 2.9\n. In recent years, applications have been directed toward environmental clean-up, drinking water treatment, industrial, and health applications.\n",

These are also defined as the fraction of filtered water that adsorb on XAD-8 resin (nonionic polymeric adsorbent) at pH 2. They are the main constituents of the dissolved organic carbon pool in surface waters (freshwaters and marine waters), and ground waters, commonly imparting a yellowish-brown color to the water system. The concentration of HS varies from place to place; the values in seawater being normally from 2 to 3 mg L\u22121. Their size, molecular weight, elemental composition, structure, and number and position of functional groups vary, depending on the origin and age of the material. HS are known to affect the behavior of some pollutants significantly in natural environments, such as trace metal speciation and toxicity, solubilization and adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants, and aqueous photochemistry. HS act as substrates for bacterial growth, inhibit the bacterial degradation of impurities (some color) in natural water, and form complex with heavy metals such as Fe, Pb, and Mn making it harder to remove them, transport the metals in the environment, and also promote the corrosion of pipes. HSs act as a source of methyl groups and thus react with hypochlorite ion, which is used as a biocide in water treatment plants, to produce disinfectant byproducts, for example, trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, other chlorinated compounds, and nitriles, some of which are suspected to be carcinogenic. More than 150 products have been identified when HS react with chlorine [31]. Recently, 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone [abbreviated as (MX)] was found in the chlorinated water containing HS. Advanced oxidation has been applied to decreasing the organic content in water including humic acid. It has the advantage of not leaving any toxic byproducts or sludge [32].

Carbon mass balance and kinetic data for complete oxidation of E. coli, Aspergillus niger, Micrococcus luteus, and Bacillus subtillus cells and spores were subsequently presented. A comprehensive mechanism and detailed description of the photokilling of E. coli on coated surfaces in air has been extensively studied in order to understand to a considerable degree and in a quantitative way the kinetics of E. coli\nimmobilization and abatement by photocatalysis, using FTIR, AFM, and CFU as a function of time and peroxidation of the membrane cell walls. Novel photoreactors and photo-assisted catalytic systems for air disinfection applications such as those using polyester supports for the catalyst, carbon nanotubes, combination with other disinfection systems, membrane systems, use of silver bactericidal agents in cotton textiles for the abatement of E. coli in air, high surface area CuO catalysts, and structure silica surfaces have also been reported. In terms of environmental health, the antifungal capability of photocatalysis against mold fungi on coated wood boards used in buildings was confirmed using A. niger as a test microbe, and UVA irradiation [36].",

            "text": "The photocatalytic technique is a versatile and efficient disinfection process capable of inactivating a wide range of harmful microorganisms in various media. It is a safe, nontoxic, and relatively inexpensive disinfection method whose adaptability allows it to be used for many purposes. Research in the field of photocatalytic disinfection is very diverse, covering a broad range of applications. Particularly, the use of photocatalysis based on NsM was shown to be effective for various air-cleaning applications to inactivate harmful airborne microbial pathogens, or to combat airborne bioterror threats, such as anthrax. Photocatalytic thin films on various substrates were also shown to have a potential application for \u201cself-disinfecting\u201d surfaces and materials, which can be used for medical implants, \u201cself-disinfecting\u201d surgical tools, and surfaces in laboratory and hospital settings, and equipment in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Photocatalytic food packaging was shown to be a potential way to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses in cut lettuce and other packaged foods. In terms of plant protection, photocatalysis is being investigated for use in hydroponic agricultures as an alternative to harsh pesticides. For water treatment applications, photocatalytic disinfection has been studied and implemented for drinking water production using novel reactors and solar irradiation. Eutrophic waters containing algal blooms were also shown to be effectively treated using coated hollow beads and solar irradiation. The effectiveness of photocatalytic disinfection for inactivating microorganisms of concern for each of these applications was presented, highlighting key studies and research efforts conducted. While the performance of this technology is still to be optimized for the specific applications, based on the literature presented, it is abundantly evident that photocatalysis should be considered a viable alternative to traditional disinfection methods in some cases.",

In this sense, the strength of photocatalytic disinfection lies in its versatility for use in many different applications.",
