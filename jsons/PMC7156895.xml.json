In the outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea, some HD patients were quarantined irrespective of their own will to prevent secondary MERS-CoV infection. Fortunately, no further patients were infected by MERS-CoV; however, the possibility of a life-threatening infection and quarantine can be more traumatic to patients with chronic kidney disease than to the general population. The experience of those placed under quarantine in terms of compliance, emotional response, and psychological impact remains under-researched in HD patients.

Close contact refers to a receiver of dialysis who was in the same place, at the same time as a suspected or confirmed MERS patient in the symptomatic period [11]. Asymptomatic casual contacts should be subjected to cohort isolation for 14 days after exposure and closely monitored for any suspicious symptoms. Casual contact refers to those who received dialysis on the same day, in the same room as a patient with suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infection, but at different times and on different beds during the symptomatic period, without having worn appropriate personal protective equipment. Hospitalized quarantine was defined as single room or cohort isolation. Patients isolated in a single room received dialysis in their own rooms installed with dialysis machines. \u201cCohort isolation\u201d is a method of hospitalized quarantine during HD treatment, in a shared HD room. Self-quarantine applied to a patient who received dialysis on a different day from dialysis date of MERS-CoV confirmed case or to patients who were exposed to MERS-CoV from a confirmed case outside HD units and had no respiratory symptoms. The patient was monitored for the development of fever or respiratory symptoms during quarantine.",

In total, 17.9% of the patients developed stress symptoms with scores over the IES-R-K cut-off. Several studies have reported the psychological impact of the quarantine experience [13, 14]. Reynolds et al. showed that of the feelings experienced during SARS quarantine, boredom (62.2%), isolation (60.6%), and frustration (58.5%) were most commonly reported. In that study, an IES-R score of at least 20 was obtained by 14.6% of respondents [14]. In a study on the psychological effects of SARS quarantine in Toronto, the 129 quarantined persons who responded to a Web-based survey exhibited a high prevalence of psychological distress [13]. Symptoms of PTSD and depression were observed in 28.9 and 31.2% of respondents, respectively. In these studies, quarantine type was home or work. Subjects were not hospitalized.",

This result is contrary to those of previous studies that showed a positive correlation between quarantine duration and post-traumatic stress symptoms [13, 14]. However, isolation duration does not mean duration only, but also represents participants\u2019 cooperativeness with the mandatory quarantine request. When HD patients who were exposed to MERS-CoV were asked to undergo mandatory quarantine, some were cooperative, such that they were admitted immediately following instructions by medical staff. Others resisted the isolation, dragging on until, finally, they were forcibly hospitalized at a later stage. Since all participants were later released from quarantine on the same day, the isolation duration indicated their cooperativeness with the mandatory quarantine and their trust in the prevention system of epidemics. Therefore, the results of this study indicated that participants who cooperated with the isolation request and received longer support reported fewer post-traumatic stress symptoms. At the subscale level, patients quarantined for less than 16 days showed higher avoidance, emotional numbing, and dissociation, compared to those quarantined for more than 16 days.",

Based on Lee [16] suggestion regarding post-traumatic growth, trauma-related symptoms occur in sequential order, as follows: catatonia, emotional numbing, dissociation, fear, intrusion, paranoid ideation, avoidance, obsession, hyperarousal, anxiety, depression, existential emptiness, searching for meaning, and posttraumatic growth. The results of the current study, indicating that participants showed emotional numbing and dissociation more often, compared to intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, in turn indicated that participants did not process the trauma and the isolation experience, so that their symptoms remained at the very early stage of processing trauma. This indicates that participants can experience subsequent symptoms of hyperarousal. Thus, psychological intervention and follow-up are needed.",

Before the outbreak of MERS, 5.9% of participants (n = 4) reported that they had pre-existing post-traumatic stress symptoms exceeding the cutoff point of the IES-R-K. This is higher than the current prevalence in the general population of a city in Korea (2.12%) [21].
