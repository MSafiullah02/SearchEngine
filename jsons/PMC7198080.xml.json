A national emergency was declared in the United States on March 13, 2020, as it spread in all 50 states with the current tally at about 85,356 infected people and 1,246 deaths [1]. On March 18, 2020, the administration imposed the Defense Production Act to ramp up the production of necessary medical equipment and passed two trillion dollars of historic stimulus in the economy [3]. This rising number of cases, unpreparedness, lack of vital resources, excessive workload, and the inability to contain the spread has caused fear and anxiety amongst the public, including physicians, residents, fellows, and healthcare workers.

The phenomena of physician burnout are adequately studied and have a direct negative impact on fatigue, stress, anxiety, depression, mood disorders, substance abuse, suicides, poor patient quality care, early retirements, and unexpected resignations [4]. In addition to the known physician burnout contributors such as work factors (excessive workloads and work hours), personal characteristics (work-life imbalance, inadequate support, sleep deprivation), and organization factors (workload expectations, insufficient rewards, and interpersonal communication, negative leadership), it essential to identify and remediate outbreak specific issues to avoid the unwanted social, psychological, and economic burden [4,5].

Anxiety and stress developed in the physicians during the outbreaks found to have a positive correlation with Maslach burnout inventory scores [4,5]. Other factors identified in addition to usual contributors to burnout are lack of control over procedures, infection control measures, the false notion of safety precautions, poor communication and directives, lack of preparedness and emotional support, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and perceived fatality [5].",

We propose firm measures to address this deficit in no particular sequence. First, empower physicians by providing essential resources adequately in the form of PPE, beds, medicines, ventilators, educational guidelines, and research updates. Second, provide consistent and updated guidelines regularly to staff for managing patients through triage based on the case priority and severity. Third, recruit additional allied healthcare and administrative staff, including medical assistants, scribes, coordinators, clerical assistants, and triage specialists, to unburden clinicians to some extend from nonclinical tasks and medical notes. Fourth, increase the workforce of clinicians by hiring additional physicians, nurse practitioners (NP), and physician assistants (PA). Furthermore, provisionally ease the rules of mandatory oversight of NPs and PAs by physicians at the times of the high volume of cases. Fifth, loosen up the restrictions on the visa requiring US-licensed physicians and allow unmatched Educational Commission For Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) certified physicians to assist at least in a limited demanded capacity. Sixth, extend the medical license that is set for renewal now and in the next six months. Seventh, initiate medical residency early for the matched candidates and allocate additional emergency budget for graduate medical education (GME) residency positions. Eight, facilitate the setup of telemedicine and telepsychiatry services to address the medical and psychiatric needs of the patients and staff. Ninth, provide support with clear communication from the leadership regarding quarantine directives, guidelines, and management protocol. Tenth, restrict excessive workload by scheduling breaks, limit work hours in emergency and intensive care units, and provide regular psychosocial support, essential basic needs, mindfulness sessions, and resilience training. Eleventh, ensure the safety and health of all staff members by the daily screening of vital signs, possible symptoms of infection, and signs of burnout. Twelfth, train, and leverage the expertise of the residents and fellows as a frontline worker to handle coronavirus cases or non-coronavirus cases. Thirteenth, protect, and support residents and fellows by creating an action plan and temporarily deferring the rules for GME training and board eligibility.",
