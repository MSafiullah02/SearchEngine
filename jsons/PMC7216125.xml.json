It is clear that there is a significant difference in the epidemiological curves illustrated in this research; Italy has an increasing non-linear curve (Fig. 2), but it is stabilizing, and seems to be progressing towards a decrease in the number of cases, whereas Brazil maintains its non-linear curve but is notoriously showing a daily exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases (Fig. 1).",
