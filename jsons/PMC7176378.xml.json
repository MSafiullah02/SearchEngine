Isolation merely indicates separation of those sick with a contagion from the people who are not.2 Quarantine began in 14th century Venice, when ships from infected ports waited at anchor for 40 days before sailors were allowed ashore. The Italian phrase \u2018quaranta giorni\u2019 meaning 40 days explains the etymology of the word. Subsequently quarantine laws were made in 1878 during a Yellow Fever outbreak and later modified in 1892 following a Cholera outbreak.3 Even today quarantine ships are required to hoist the yellow flag.",

China placed many cities like Wuhan under effective mass quarantine or lock down. Thousands across the world have been asked to self-isolate at home or kept in ad hoc quarantine hospitals. It has happened across countries like Iran, UK, Germany, South Korea and Italy. India is no exception. Mass quarantine was effective in containing the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and Ebola outbreak in 2014.4 In India, currently we have more than 500 positive cases that are mostly travel-linked. India's self-quarantine is a bold step. But it has to ensure that the disease is not spreading undetected.",
