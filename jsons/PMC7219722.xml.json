The timing of the COVID-19 outbreak, prior to the annual Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, coincided with people returning to their family homes, resulting in several billion person-trips made by residents and visitors [3]. In just 30 days, COVID-19 rapidly spread from a single city to the entire country, and from there to other countries around the world [4-7]. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern [8].",

It mainly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets, similar to the common cold and influenza viruses (ie, through face-to-face contact accompanied by a sneeze or cough). It can also be transmitted through contact with the secretions of infected individuals. The role of fecal\u2013oral transmission is yet to be determined for COVID-19, but it was found to occur during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [9]. The population is generally susceptible to the virus. Based on current epidemiological surveys, the latency period is usually 2-14 days (median 4 days), though longer cases have been noted [10]. COVID-19 is contagious during the latency period. At the time of submission of this paper, targeted antiviral drugs and vaccines were not yet available for COVID-19.",

From January 20, 2020, when person-to-person transmission was confirmed and made public in China by Dr Zhong Nanshan [11], a renowned Chinese respiratory scientist, a large-scale, multilevel health education campaign was implemented in China. Information about COVID-19 spread swiftly on the internet, WeChat, microblogs, television, radio, and other media outlets. In rural areas, educational materials such as posters, bulletin boards, banners, and booklets were immediately provided to people with limited access to the internet. Core information included details on the epidemic situation, the government\u2019s response to the epidemic, information on COVID-19, and self-protection strategies. Following the recommendations of health authorities, Chinese citizens put in place measures to protect themselves against COVID-19, such as staying at home as much as possible, limiting social contact, and wearing protective masks when in public.",

Traditional strategies, including active contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, a series of social distancing policies, and community containment were reinforced at a national level. China\u2019s emergency management of SARS was heavily criticized in 2003 [12,13]; however, rapid and decisive strategies and the continuing decline of daily new cases of COVID-19 have earned favorable comment [14]. In addition to traditional measures, big data and mobile internet technologies were used to prevent the spread. On February 11, 2020, a unified health QR code system was promoted, first in Hangzhou, and then nationwide. The QR codes, generated with the mobile app Alipay, were based on users\u2019 movements over a 14-day period, including whether users had been to virus-hit areas and had contact with confirmed or suspected cases. Instead of completing a health report form, Chinese citizens can now show the QR code when required; this is a much more time efficient approach to reducing the risk of virus transmission. It has also helped to facilitate traffic and speed up the resumption of work and production, ultimately promoting regional economic recovery [18]. Further, a training program was set up on the National Health Commission website for continuing medical education to share the latest knowledge on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 to enhance the capacity of health workers around China [20]. Due to restrictions on gatherings during the epidemic and continuous deepening of knowledge on COVID-19, online education is an appropriate way to empower health workers.",

Participants in our study were younger and more educated compared to the whole population. However, this allowed for the participation of a large group of geographically disparate participants at one discrete time point in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. For population studies on infectious diseases, like SARS and COVID-19, internet-based surveys are the most appropriate method for data collection, since it avoids transmission of the virus during face-to-face investigation. Second, the number of daily new cases used to describe the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in China is likely higher due to insufficient testing capacity and difficulties in identifying and counting mild and asymptomatic cases. However, the decline in new cases creates capacity for daily testing. Third, public strategies described in our study represented the main measures taken by the government, health workers, companies, and factories, and we may have missed some details due to restrictions on paper length.",
