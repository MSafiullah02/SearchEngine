The close temporal relationship between AKI and respiratory failure occurrence is somewhat suggestive of ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which often happens concordant with systemic collapse. However, other etiologies must continue to be considered. The prothrombotic state that has been observed among Covid-19 patients suggests other renal pathogenic factors. Our urinary results are provocative. We found a high median urine specific gravity and a majority of patients with urinary sodium less than 35 meq/L at the time of development of AKI. Traditionally these findings are most indicative of prerenal states, but may also be found with glomerulonephritis and even certain forms of ATN. Since a cytokine storm often occurs in close temporal proximity to respiratory failure, it is possible that circulating substances or other related factors could contribute to AKI. It was beyond the scope of the current work to evaluate for these possibilities. In addition, our findings of fairly high rates of proteinuria and hematuria are noteworthy, but inferences are limited as we were unable to ascertain indwelling urethral catheter status at the time of urine collection. It should be noted that, Su et al, in a study from Wuhan, China28, determined autopsy findings among 26 patients, with tubular injury as the primary renal finding.",

This algorithm was based upon KDIGO AKI criteria and the United Kingdom National Health Service AKI algorithm31. It attempts to calculate baseline kidney function from pre-hospitalization serum creatinine values, and simultaneously recalculates baseline to determine AKI based upon the aforementioned KDIGO criteria. The baseline creatinine was defined as the median serum creatinine within 8 to 365 days prior to hospital admission. When there were no prior serum creatinine records, we used the serum creatinine on the day of admission as the baseline serum creatinine, with subsequent baseline recalculated with each new serum creatinine according to a pre-defined algorithm (Supplementary Figure S1). As only 15% of patients had pre-hospital baseline serum creatinine measurements available, the baseline was retrospectively adjusted to the median serum creatinine value from the entirety of the hospitalization (this value was chosen, rather than the nadir or final creatinine to provide a more conservative estimate to adjudicate AKI). A ratio of greater than 1.5 from peak to median was classified as AKI. Any patient requiring RRT, regardless of automated AKI stage reporting, was defined as stage 3 AKI, as per KDIGO criteria. We did not use the urine output criteria to define AKI as the documentation of urine output in the EHR was unreliable. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation32.",

Chronic kidney disease was not included as a comorbid condition because the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease using EHR has low sensitivity and low positive predictive value33. Moreover, pre-hospitalization eGFR was available only in 15% of the patients, and thus precludes ascertainment of the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease based on eGFR. In addition to baseline clinical data, we collected details of hospital admission such as intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), vasopressor support, and baseline laboratory test results within 48 hours of hospital admission. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many additional ICUs were created in non-traditional hospital areas and units. Hence, ICU stay was defined as either one of the following: need for invasive mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressor or inotrope support, under the care of an ICU service, or in a known ICU location.",

To compare the clinical characteristics of patients across different stages of AKI, we performed Kruskal Wallis test. To identify risk factors associated with the development of AKI, we performed a logistic regression model, with adjustment for risk factors that differed between those who developed AKI and those who did not. The models were built using stepwise procedure, and variables were entered into the models when the alpha level of risk factor was less than 0.15. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We performed sensitivity analysis for missing data. The statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.3. (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",
