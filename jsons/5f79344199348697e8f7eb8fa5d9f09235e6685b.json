            "text": "Mutations within the SAMHD1 gene lead to a rare genetic disorder, the AGS, a primary immunodeficiency disorder that resembles an immune system's response pattern to certain chronic viral infections, displaying a massive production of the antiviral cytokine IFN-a and a detrimental activation of the immune system [1] . The deficiency in SAMHD1 expression results in a complex disease characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, a chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis, and an early-onset encephalopathy that leads to severe intellectual and physical handicap [2] . The potential involvement of SAMHD1 in innate immunity had been suggested initially by studies of its mouse ortholog Mg11, which is IFN inducible in macrophages and DCs [3] . Subsequent studies showed an increased SAMHD1 expression upon stimulatory DNA treatment of macrophages [4, 5] and its up-regulation in the context of viral infections [6] [7] [8] . Whereas the SAM domain mediates proteinprotein interactions, the HD domain possesses dNTP triphosphohydrolase activity [9, 10] , through which SAMHD1 hydrolyzes dNTPs to deoxynucleosides. SAMHD1 was identified as a potent restriction factor for HIV [11, 12] , other nonhuman retroviruses [13] , and herpesviruses, including HSV-1 [14, 15] . For HIV, the current mode-of-action model suggests that SAMHD1, through its enzymatic function as a dNTP triphosphohydrolase, diminishes intracellular dNTP pools in noncycling cells, decreasing their concentrations below a threshold required for efficient HIV-1 cDNA synthesis by the viral RT [13, [16] [17] [18] . Furthermore, a metal-dependent 39 \u2192 59 exonuclease activity of SAMHD1 against ssDNAs and ssRNAs was demonstrated in vitro [19] . The RNAse activity was suggested recently to play a pivotal role for the HIV-restrictive activity of SAMHD1 by directly degrading the HIV-1 RNA of incoming particles [20] .",

Based on these specimens, an in-house, whole-body TMA containing a total of 468 paraffinized tissue sections from 25 different healthy organs from over 210 donors in total was assembled [25] . This TMA consists of a total of 5 coverslips, each containing 90-100 round sections (diameter of 2 mm) from paraffinized tissue blocks (see Fig. 1A and B, for examples). In more detail, histopathological tissue blocks, without evidence of tumor and/or inflammation, were selected from donors that had undergone surgery for non-neoplastic reasons, i.e. tonsillitis, diverticulosis, and phimosis, or for neoplastic reasons, i.e. colorectal carcinoma or lung carcinoma. Other tissues, i.e., heart and brain, were derived from autopsies. In any case, the tissues used for the construction of the TMA were tumor and inflammation free, as assessed by histopathology. Donors were 60% men/boys and 40% women/girls, and ages were between 5 and 82 yr. Underlying conditions other than the indication for surgery have not been evaluated. Healthy tissues represented on the TMA analyses were salivary gland (n = 15), thyroid (n = 16), thymus (n = 10), lung (n = 20), heart (n = 21), esophagus (n = 21), stomach (n = 20), small intestine (n = 19), large intestine (n = 24), liver (n = 18), gallbladder (n = 14), spleen (n = 27), pancreas (n = 7), kidney (n = 24), adrenal gland (n = 5), bladder (n = 7), prostate (n = 25), testis (n = 22), uterus (n = 5), skin (n = 5), fat (n = 14), skeletal muscle (n = 11), ovary (n = 7), tonsil (n = 8), and appendix (n = 8). After immunohistochemical staining for SAMHD1, TMA slides were scanned for image acquisition by use of the Aperio ScanScope CS (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), analyzed with Aperio ImageScope software (Leica Microsystems), and rated, in principle, based on the immunoreactive scoring system of Allred et al. [26] and as recently reported [25] . Each section was assigned 2 scores: 1 score for the fraction of cells that stained positive (0, ,1% positive cells; 1, 1-10% positive cells; 2, 11-33% positive cells; 3, 34-66% positive cells; 4, .66% positive cells) and another score for the intensity of staining (0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, intermediate staining; 3, strong staining). The overall amount of SAMHD1 was then calculated as the sum of the scores for the portion of positive, tissuespecific cells and for staining intensity. A total score of 7 was categorized as high staining, scores of 5 and 6 as medium staining, and scores of 2-4 as low staining (see Fig. 1C ).",

Given the potential role of SAMHD1 in limiting transmission of HIV-1, we explored its expression in anogenital mucosa and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Immunohistochemical staining of vagina, foreskin, anal mucosa and rectum tissue sections revealed abundant, constitutive expression of the restriction factor in infiltrating and resident-nucleated hematopoietic cells in mucosa and submucosa of these transmission site tissues (Fig. 2B-D ",

Nitrocellulose membranes with separated lysates from cytokine-treated cells were reprobed with this antiserum. pSAMHD1(T592) was detectable in primary CD4 + T cells only following T cell activation but not in quiescent cells from the same donor ( Fig. 5A and B) . Remarkably, pSAMHD1 (T592) expression was unaltered by cytokine treatment in resting and activated CD4 + T cells (Fig. 5A and B) . In contrast to cycling CD4 + T cells, pSAMHD1(T592) was undetectable in differentiated MDM, and also for these myeloid cells, neither IFN-a, IFN-g, IL-12/IL-18, nor TNF-a stimulation had an impact on this status (Fig. 6) . Collectively, neither T cell activation nor the addition of major proinflammatory cytokines, with the notable exception of IL-1b, modulated SAMHD1's expression levels or phosphorylation at threonine 592 in primary lymphoid and myeloid HIV target cells.",

Our whole-body TMA expression approach allowed us to examine cellular in vivo targets of pathogenic viruses that have been shown to be inhibited by the nucleotide-modulating antiviral factor SAMHD1 in tissue culture. For cells that can, in principle, be infected by HIV-1 in vivo, SAMHD1 in situ expression was demonstrated in monocytes, macrophages, DCs, pDCs, and mature CD4 + T cells, as well as in all developmental stages of thymic T cells. Thus, virtually all major HIV target cells in an infected individual potentially carry the SAMHD1 protein. keratinocytes, and neurocytes were found to express SAMHD1, also suggesting that this viral pathogen may frequently encounter the restriction factor in the context of its natural infection. In the lung, alveolar pneumocytes, which express the restriction factors SAMHD1 (present study), as well as CD317/tetherin [25] , are targeted by various respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses [34] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [35] , and respiratory syncytial virus [36] . At least for CD317, influenza viruses seem to have evolved mechanisms of viral antagonism [37, 38] . For these respiratory viruses, it is currently unclear whether SAMHD1 impacts their replication and/or whether they encode a SAMHD1 antagonist similar to the viral protein X proteins of HIV-2 and certain SIV strains [39] .",

This was clearly not the case: SAMHD1 was expressed in cycling, highly proliferative primary cells (e.g., endometrium and activated T cells), as well as noncycling cells (e.g., vascular endothelium, resting T cells, and macrophages). This broad expression pattern suggests that the regulation of the physiologic functions of SAMHD1 may occur by direct modulation of its enzymatic and antiviral activities rather than at the transcriptional/translational level. In line with this notion, recent studies reported that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 mediated phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at residue T592 regulates its capacity to restrict HIV-1 [22, 23] . Interestingly, pSAMHD1(T592) does not seem to regulate the protein's Histogram bars represent the arithmetic mean + SD of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of SAMHD1 expression in the respective thymocyte subsets of 4 donors. Thymocyte differentiation was categorized into the 7 stages indicated: 1) CD34 + CD1 2 , recent thymic immigrants; 2) CD3 + CD4 + CD8 2 , immature, single-positive cells; 3) CD3 2 CD4 + CD8 + , double-positive thymocytes undergoing b-selection; 4) CD3 + CD4 + CD8 + , doublepositive thymocytes that have undergone b-selection; 5) CD3 + CD27 + CD69 + , positively selected thymocytes; 6) CD3 + CD4 2 CD8 + , mature CD8 + thymic T cells; and 7) CD3 + CD4 + CD8 2 , mature CD4 + thymic T cells. The numbers indicated below the histogram represent the percentage of SAMHD1 + cells within the respective subset. catalytic dNTPase activity [23, 33, 40] , suggesting, at least in part, a regulatory uncoupling of its antiviral and enzymatic functions.",

            "text": "It is important to define which cytokines and stimuli affect expression and function of SAMHD1 in primary HIV target cells. Recently, Cribier et al. [33] reported the loss of pSAMHD1 (T592) in activated CD4 + T cells and MDM following exposure to IFN-a. Whereas in our study, pSAMHD1(T592) was also readily detected in CD4 + T cells upon TCR stimulation, in line with other reports [23, 33] , we did not observe a reduction in SAMHD1 phosphorylation by treatment with IFN-a or IFN-g, despite an apparent induction of type I and type II IFN-positive controls MxA and IFI16, respectively. A recent study reported an ;2-fold induction of SAMHD1 expression in MDM by treatment with a combination of IL-12 and IL-18, each at 100 ng/ml [41] . We were neither able to confirm this cytokine-mediated up-regulation of the restriction factor at 100 or 1000 ng/ml nor did we observe changes in the pSAMHD1(T592) expression of cells. Likewise, this cytokine combination neither affected overall levels nor phosphorylation of SAMHD1 in CD4 + T cells. In line with our observation, St Gelais et al. [24] did not observe an increase in SAMHD1 levels in CD4 + T cells or MDDCs following exposure to type I IFN. Of note, IL-1b was the only cytokine that down-regulated SAMHD1 significantly in activated CD4 + T cells. However, it is unclear whether this translates into any change in the HIV susceptibility of cells, as SAMHD1 is not believed to pose a restriction for HIV in proliferating T cells. For assessment of the SAMHD1 status and cytokine responses in MDM, the monocyte isolation and differentiation protocol may be of particular relevance: the M-CSF-based rapid differentiation protocol (3 days) used in 1 study [22] resulted in strong pSAMHD1(T592) expression. In contrast, our results, in agreement with Allouch et al. [42] , showed a low-level or absent pSAMHD1(T592) expression in MDM differentiated with human AB serum for 7-10 days. Besides differentiation regimes, the purity of the initial monocyte preparation from PBMC may also affect this analysis, as residual T cells can become activated during the monocyte differentiation process and thus, contribute to an appreciable pSAMHD1(T592) signal in an immunoblot analysis of bulk cell populations. Collectively, the reported discrepancies of SAMHD1 expression, phosphorylation, and regulation in primary CD4 + T cells and MDM may, in part, stem from differences in methodology and will have to be addressed carefully by additional studies.",
