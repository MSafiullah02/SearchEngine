This was encouraging news, as it confirmed that efforts to isolate patients should bring the disease under control. Contrast this with flu, which boasts an R0 of about 10. For diseases this infectious, quarantining those who show symptoms is not enough to bring the average number of new infections caused by each case to below one \u2014 the level necessary for an epidemic to go into decline.",

That explains why most transmission has been in confined settings, such as hospitals. But unusual foci of infection in Hong Kong show that this isn't the whole story. Most striking was the outbreak at the Amoy Gardens apartment block, where the brother of one resident seems to have infected 321 other people. Scientists tore the block apart, eventually implicating a faulty sewage system that allowed droplets contaminated with faeces to form in the block's bathrooms4. Transpose SARS to a developing country with poor sanitation, therefore, and the dynamics of its spread might be different.",
