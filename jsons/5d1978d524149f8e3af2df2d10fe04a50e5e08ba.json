Results We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of the 2019-nCoV cases. The spatial distribution of cases per unit outflow population indicated that some areas with large outflow population might have been underestimated for the infection, such as Henan and Hunan provinces. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could have been prevented, and if A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Conclusions Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger for the transmission of 2019-nCoV infection in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to control the epidemic.",

However, an estimated 5 million individuals had already left Wuhan for the holiday or travelling, some of which rushed out after the lockdown announcement [6] . In addition, the novel coronavirus is infectious during the incubation period and when the symptoms are not obvious, which is likely to make the huge floating population potential sources of infection [7] . Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the population transported A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 from Wuhan may have a significant impact on the potential outbreaks in other parts of China.",

Thus, we conducted this study with the following objectives: 1) to evaluate the impacts of the population movement on the spatial transmission of the 2019-nCoV cases at the provincial and city levels in China; 2) to estimate the potential outbreak risk at areas with the population outflowed from Wuhan; 3) to evaluate the effectiveness of the city closure measures on the epidemic control.",

We took the average index of the population outflow between January 21 and 23 as the daily index of population outflow before the city closure, and used the same calculation method to estimate the index of population outflow within Wuhan increased by the delayed city closure on January 24 and January 25 (the delayed outflow index). We multiplied the delayed outflow index by the average proportion and one corresponding unit to estimate the increased number of cases caused by one-day and two-day delayed city closure of Wuhan for each province in China. (Table 1) . On the contrary, if the closure measures was delayed for one to two days, the number of cases would increase by 722 and 1462, respectively. Our study provided timely evidence for the formulation of efficient strategies to prevent diseases from spreading out. On the one hand, the result could help assess the effectiveness of the prevention and control efforts. For example, the cases in Zhejiang and Guangdong are apparently more than estimated, which indicated a better health emergency response system (i.e. higher detection efficiency) or inadequate isolation, whereas the cases reported in Henan were much lower than expected. Two possible explanations should be considered: (1) strong prevention and control measures had been adopted in Henan; (2) the epidemic in Henan has been underestimated and enhanced screening efforts should be enforced. On the other hand, exploring the association was expected to help identify high-risk areas and guide health strategy A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 15 formulation [19, 20] . Take Henan as an example, great difference between estimated and reported data may imply a great increase of cases in the future, which required enhancement of the surveillance system and rational allocation of resources [17] . The medicine supply, personal protective equipment, hospital supplies, and the human resources necessary to respond to an outbreak should be always ensured [21] . In addition, this study could be used to guide the assessment of the risk of disease transmission and help raise public awareness. As a large number of infected people had transported to all of 31 provinces, epidemics across the country may be inevitable.",

Despite inconsistent reports on the role of the lockdown in halting the disease transmission across China [11, 20, 21] , the unprecedented measure might play an important role in slowing the epidemic spread, especially when an effective vaccine was developed [23, 24] . In addition, to explore the impact of date selection, we estimated the changes of cases when the measure was implemented on different A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 16 date. The results varied significantly, 1420 cases could be prevented with the measure implemented two days earlier, and the number of cases will increase by 1462 with the lockdown implemented two days later, suggesting that the effect of the lockdown depending on the choice of date greatly, which could provide a reference for the future outbreaks. Since the political and economic effects were not considered, further studies on secondary impacts of the measure, like socioeconomic impacts, were also warranted. Though we estimated that some cases would possibly be prevented if the policy was implemented earlier, it was actually hard to make such a huge decision given the whole picture of the infection was not clear at that stage. The authors believe that the current policy was appropriate at this complex situation.",

From beginning of Spring Festival travel rush on January 10 and announcement of 2019-nCoV infection, the mean index of population outflow rose to 66777.98 (95% CI: 61125.90-72962.78), which increased by 15.10% compared with the previous period. Meanwhile, 2019-nCoV cases gradually accumulated in Wuhan and several nearby cities. On January 20, the news that the virus could be transmitted from person to person was released, then a large number of Wuhan residents left Wuhan. The corresponding index of population outflow of this period surged to 112385.88 (95% CI: 107367.44-118403.21), which increased by 93.60% compared with the previous period.

The scatter diagram demonstrated the association between the number of 2019-nCoV cases and index of outflow population at the scales of province and city. At the provincial level (Figure 3), outflow population from Wuhan was mainly distributed in Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, Anhui, corresponding to a higher number of 2019-nCoV cases. The index of outflow population of Henan was about 50000, and of cases was about 450, in contrast, the floating population index of Zhejiang was only one fifth of that of Henan, but the number of cases was as high as 600, indicating the actual epidemic situation in Henan may have been underestimated.

For instance, the index of outflow population of Wenzhou (Zhejiang Province) was almost the same as that of Luoyang (Henan Province), but the number of 2019-nCoV cases in the two cities was quite different. To evaluate the effect of the city closure on the infection transmission one and two days in advance, we used the index of population outflow of January 21-23, 2020 when the Wuhan was still open and index of population outflow of January 24-31, 2020 when the city closure policy had been implemented, and the calculations gave advance and 211429.60 for city closure two days in advance.
