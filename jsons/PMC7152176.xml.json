The virus showed 50% homology of the partial M protein gene sequence of several morbilliviruses and thus was initially called equine morbillivirus (EMV).48 The name was subsequently changed to Hendra virus (HeV) when it became apparent that horses were not the natural host for the virus and that it did not belong in the genus Morbillivirus.\n",

A number of the characteristics of the Bangladesh outbreaks were similar to the outbreak in Malaysia: delayed recognition, a primary presentation of humans with fever and CNS signs, and a high case-fatality rate. In marked contrast to the Malaysian outbreak, however, infection in humans was not associated with disease in pigs, and evidence indicated horizontal human transmission. Further, the pattern of the Bangladesh outbreaks suggests a sporadic, geographically scattered introduction of infection to humans. Nucleotide sequence data also support a different epidemiology in Bangladesh. Data obtained from human cases in Malaysia suggest a single source of human infection from the porcine amplifying host.1, 11, 15 Data from Bangladesh cases formed a cluster clearly distinct from the Malaysian sequences, but differed from each other by approximately 0.8%, suggesting possibly multiple introductions of virus into humans.30\n",

In Southeast Asia, anthropogenic activities (primarily habitat destruction and hunting) constitute the major threats. Deforestation, whether for agricultural land, commercial logging, or urban development, is widespread and results in loss or abandonment of roosting sites and loss of feeding habitats. This habitat loss caused by clearing is often exacerbated by tropical storms because the remnant forest may be particularly prone to high-wind damage. Hunting, whether for consumption, sport, or crop protection, at both a local and a commercial level, results in the abandonment of roost and feeding sites.47 A scenario thus emerges of flying fox populations under stress with altered foraging and behavioral patterns, of niche expansion, and of closer proximity to humans. In Australia the geographic redistribution of roosting sites has been increasingly into urban areas in recent decades.28\n",

Quarantine of infected premises, movement controls on stock, and disinfection have so far proved effective.7 Veterinarians involved in these disease investigations are advised to wear appropriate protective equipment and to use a limited necropsy approach, because horses have been the source of infection for all four human cases. Putative risk factors for infection in horses appear to be age (>8 years old), breed (Thoroughbred), housing (paddocked), season (late gestation or birthing season of local flying fox populations), and the presence of food trees favored by flying foxes in the index-case paddock.23 A considerable research focus on the ecology of HeV has yet to define the route of virus excretion or any temporal pattern of infection in flying foxes. This information and knowledge of the actual mode of flying fox\u2013to-horse transmission would facilitate a risk management approach to spillover infection in horses.",
