During virus infection, HA first mediates virus attachment and subsequent entry into target cells [3], [4], [5]. Thus, HA protein is considered the primary target for inducing protective immunity against IAVs [6], [7], [8]. Indeed, antibodies specific for HA have been shown to inhibit and/or neutralize virus infection in vaccinated hosts and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are regarded as one of the important passive therapeutics for treatment of influenza [9], [10], [11], [12]. It has also been shown that mAbs targeting HA glycoprotein may broadly neutralize homologous and heterologous strains with different clades of IAV infection and prevent formation of escape mutants [13], [14], [15], [16]. To identify more potent and specific neutralizing mAbs as immunotherapeutics for treatment of influenza, it is essential to develop an assay for rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs against HA of IAVs.",

Here we report the development of a safe and convenient neutralization assay for rapid screening neutralizing mAbs targeting HA of H5N1 and H1N1 IAV. We first generated a series of pseudoviruses bearing HAs of four clades of H5N1 IAV isolated from avians and humans, respectively, and the 2009 epidemic H1N1 IAV, and an HIV-1 backbone (pNL4-3.luc.RE). These pseudoviruses are single-cycle and replication-deficient viruses [18], [19], [20]. Then we used these pseudoviruses to establish a neutralizing assay in a BSL-2 laboratory, based on which we screened a panel of mAbs specific for the HA of an H5N1 virus and successfully identified three specific neutralizing mAbs, suggesting that this established assay is safe and efficient for screening neutralizing mAbs targeting HA of IAVs.",

Although packaged HA pseudoviruses without NA may infect target cells, the addition of exogenous NA to 293T cells co-transfected by HIV-1 (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and HA plasmid was shown to significantly increase the transduction efficiency (Fig. 2A), possibly because NA protein may help to remove sialic acid from the host cells to facilitate viral release [25], thus making it an indispensable component of HA-based IAV infection. These results are consistent with previous reports by Rong and colleagues [21]. The produced HA pseudoviruses were demonstrated to infect a number of non-human (MDCK, Vero and CHO-K1) and human (293T and A549) cells. Because the human 293T and A549 cells maintained higher transduction efficacy (Fig. 2B), it can be reasonably inferred that both the avian-origin H5N1 and the swine-origin H1N1 viruses isolated from avian (goose) and humans have a higher tendency to infect humans than other hosts, such as Chinese hamster and African green monkey.
