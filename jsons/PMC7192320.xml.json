The contemporary business world is full of surprises and it is in this context that the corporate should practice a governance structure whose essence should be to balance the influence of stakeholders\u2019 pressure, culture, and corporate social responsibility (Gaur et al. 2019; Kowalczyk and Kucharska 2020). Different model of corporate governance\u2014market oriented and network oriented\u2014are in practice across the globe but its essence has been to mitigate conflict of interests amongst the stakeholders (Bottenberg et al. 2017). The corporate governance helps ensures corporate accountability through the mechanisms of processes, customs, policies, laws & institutions, and the likes. Moreover, the demands from the larger society has been that the company should not only aim to be profitable but it needs to demonstrate ethical corporate behaviors, environmental awareness, sound corporate governance, and the likes (e.g., Bhaumik et al. 2019; El-Kassar and Singh 2019; Patnaik et al. 2018). However, the discipline of Corporate Governance is not \u2018static\u2019 but \u2018organic\u2019 in character. In other words, to be competitive in the fast changing world, the firms need to continuously reinvent their corporate governance structure so that they effectively meet any new opportunities as thrown to them by the post-modern world economy. It is in this context that a need has been felt amongst the academics, practitioners, policy makers, social activists, etc. to revisit the challenges and opportunities confronted by the discipline of corporate governance and business ethics (e.g., Mitra and Gaur 2020; Mukherjee et al. 2019; Singh et al. 2020).",
