            "text": "Human noroviruses (huNoV) are the most frequent cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide, particularly genogroup II genotype 4 (GII.4) variants. The viral nonstructural (NS) proteins encoded by the ORF1 polyprotein induce vesical clusters harboring the viral replication sites. Little is known so far about the ultrastructure of these replication organelles or the contribution of individual NS proteins to their biogenesis. We compared the ultrastructural changes induced by expression of norovirus ORF1 polyproteins with those induced upon infection with murine norovirus (MNV). Characteristic membrane alterations induced by ORF1 expression resembled those found in MNV infected cells, consisting of vesicle accumulations likely built from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which included single membrane vesicles (SMVs), double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multi membrane vesicles (MMVs). In-depth analysis using electron tomography suggested that MMVs originate through the enwrapping of SMVs with tubular structures similar to mechanisms reported for picornaviruses. Expression of GII.4 NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 fused to GFP revealed distinct membrane alterations when analyzed by correlative light and electron microscopy. Expression of NS1-2 induced proliferation of smooth ER membranes forming long tubular structures that were affected by mutations in the active center of the putative NS1-2 hydrolase domain. NS3 was associated with ER membranes around lipid droplets (LDs) and induced the formation of convoluted membranes, which were even more pronounced in case of NS4. Interestingly, NS4 was the only GII.4 protein capable of inducing SMV and DMV formation when expressed individually. Our work provides the first ultrastructural analysis of norovirus GII.4 induced vesicle clusters and suggests that their morphology and biogenesis is most similar to picornaviruses. We further identified NS4 as a key factor in the formation of membrane alterations of huNoV and provide models of the putative membrane topologies of NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 to guide future studies.",

In the case of human noroviruses (huNoV), the major cause of acute viral gastroenteritis, these are induced by the ORF1 polyprotein, which is post-translationally processed into the functional nonstructural (NS) proteins. Partly due to the lack of efficient cell culture models, little is known so far about membrane alterations induced by huNoV belonging to the most clinically relevant genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4), nor about the function of individual NS proteins in their formation. We therefore expressed ORF1 proteins of GII.4 and individual NS proteins in cells to study their contribution to viral replication complex formation. Expression of ORF1 proteins of GII.4 induced vesicular membrane alterations comparable to those found in infected cells and similar to picornaviruses and hepatitis C virus (HCV). GII.4 NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 are contributing to viral membrane alterations. Our work provides new insights into their function in huNoV induced replication complex formation while identifying NS4 as the most important single determinant. This knowledge might provide novel attractive targets for future therapies inhibiting the formation of the membranous viral replication complex, as exemplified by the efficacy of HCV NS5A inhibitors.",

Still, no vaccine or specific antiviral therapy is available to counteract huNoV infections. Noroviruses are divided into seven different genogroups (GI-GVII) and further subdivided into numerous genotypes [2] . Noroviruses grouped into GI, GII and GIV mainly infect humans but also other species, while GV infects mice. The GII genotype 4 (GII.4) cause the majority of infections with novel outbreak strains emerging every 2-3 years, likely in a response to an immunological pressure of herd immunity [3] [4] [5] .",

Murine noroviruses (MNV) additionally encode an ORF4 from an alternative reading frame located in ORF2, termed virulence factor 1 (VF1), involved in antagonism of the host innate immune response [7] . The 5' end of the genome contains a short 5 nucleotide untranslated region (UTR) and the 3'end contains a short UTR and poly-A tail (reviewed in [8] ). The norovirus genome is covalently linked at the 5'end with the viral protein VPg (also termed NS5). ORF1 is translated from the full-length genomic RNA, whereas ORF2, ORF3, and ORF4 are mainly translated from a VPg linked subgenomic RNA (reviewed in [8] ).",

            "text": "Membrane rearrangements play a key role in the establishment of viral replication complexes for positive strand RNA viruses. In principle these membrane alterations can be subdivided into two morphotypes (reviewed in [22, 23] ). First, the \"invagination type\" consists of single membrane invaginations of a donor membrane which stay connected to the cytoplasm via a pore and are represented by alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Viral replication takes place inside these vesicles and the viral RNA contributes to their morphology [24] , with the exception of Brome mosaic virus 1a protein which generates spherules in absence of RNA replication [25] . Second, the \"DMV-type\" consists of vesicular and tubular membrane rearrangements wrapped by one (single membrane vesicle, SMV), two (double membrane vesicles, DMVs) and multiple membranes (multi membrane vesicles, MMVs), induced by picornaviruses, coronaviruses and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Most of these structures have no visible connection to the cytoplasm and the functional significance of the different vesicle subtypes as well as the localization of the RNA synthesis machinery is still a matter of debate. However, these structures can typically be induced simply by expression of the replicase proteins in absence of RNA replication, exemplified by picornaviruses [26] [27] [28] [29] and HCV [30] [31] [32] . Sole expression of individual nonstructural proteins already induces distinct membrane alterations, which are less complex than those derived from the polyprotein. Still, such studies have allowed the identification of those viral proteins contributing to the morphogenesis of viral replication sites and the unraveling of some of their functions [26-28,30,31, [33] [34] [35] . In the case of HCV, virus induced membrane alterations have been identified as efficient drug targets for silibinin [36] , direct acting antivirals like NS5A inhibitors [37] and host targeting drugs like cyclophilin inhibitors [38] .",

A replicon model has been established in case of GI noroviruses [40] , but no ultrastructural analysis is currently available. A plasmid driven GII.3 replicon model allows moderate RNA replication levels, but it remains difficult to dissect the contribution of protein expression and bona fide RNA replication in this system [41] . Recently, tremendous progress has been achieved in cultivating the more clinically relevant GII.4 strains in both B-cells [42] and enteric organoids [43] , still neither of these models has yet been proven to allow ultrastructural studies. Therefore, most of our knowledge of norovirus induced membrane alterations has been obtained using the MNV model [44] . Previous studies showed accumulations of vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected macrophages consisting of single and double membrane vesicles, which have not been further characterized [44] . In addition, it has been shown that MNV induced vesicle clusters co-localize with all MNV NS proteins and with viral replication intermediates and that these extensive rearrangements of intracellular membranes are mainly derived from the secretory pathway, including ER, Golgi and endosomal membranes [15] . Furthermore, the MNV replication organelles seem tightly associated with the cytoskeleton, probably mediated by the main capsid protein [45] . Little is known so far about the contribution of individual nonstructural proteins to virus induced replication vesicles, but it is believed that NS1-2 and NS4 are the main drivers in this process due to their membrane association and comparison to picornavirus proteins (reviewed in [8] ). In addition, NS3 is associated with membranes and recently has been shown to be associated with highly motile vesicular structures [13, 46] .",

We further observed that SMVs and DMVs were reminiscent of structures found upon MNV infection. The impact of individual GII.4 NS proteins on intracellular membranes was studied by correlative light and electron microscopy, allowing the localization of each protein within the cellular ultrastructural context. GII.4 NS1-2 induced membrane proliferation of the smooth ER, which was strikingly different from MNV NS1/2. NS3 was tightly associated with lipid droplets (LDs) and induced convoluted membranes. However, only NS4 expression was sufficient to induce SMV and DMV formation, much like the ability of HCV NS5A and poliovirus (PV) 3AB to induce DMVs.",

We therefore generated Huh7-CD300lf cells stably expressing the MNV receptor [47, 48] and verified that these cells were indeed permissive for MNV infection by demonstrating the presence of NS3 24h after infection (S1A and S1B Fig). In addition, MNV infected Huh7-CD300lf cells produced similar amounts of progeny virus compared to RAW 264.7 cells, albeit with slightly delayed kinetics (S1C Fig). In contrast, Huh7 cells lacking CD300lf failed to amplify the virus inoculum (S1C Fig) . Therefore, ectopic expression of CD300lf rendered Huh7 cells fully permissive for MNV infection and supported the entire MNV replication cycle. Ultrastructural analysis of MNV infected Huh7-CD300lf revealed two major phenotypes not observed in uninfected cells (Fig 1) : (1) Areas containing vesicles with a variety of shapes, sizes and types (Fig 1A) . In addition to previously reported SMVs, more complex structures like DMVs and MMVs were found, often in proximity to lipid droplets (LD). This phenotype likely resembled an early replication phase described previously [44] . (2) A massive rearrangement of the entire endomembrane system consisting of complex structures, often associated with virions, and lacking an organized morphology was observed during what was likely a later stage of the replication cycle [44] (Fig 1B) . We found similar phenotypes in RAW 264.7 cells (S2 Fig), which have been used in previous studies to characterize the ultrastructure of the MNV replication organelle [15, 44] , except that these cells lacked LDs (S2 Fig). We next analyzed whether similar structures were generated by expression of MNV ORF1. MNV ORF1 was expressed in Huh7 T7 cells under transcriptional control of the T7 promoter and translational control of an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site (EMCV IRES), allowing efficient cytoplasmic expression of proteins of interest in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase (Fig 2A and 2B ). For ultrastructural analysis we used chemical fixation (CF) or high-pressure freezing (HPF) (Fig 2C) . Regardless of the fixation technique, we identified basically the same types of membrane alterations observed in phenotype 1 of MNV infected cells: vesiculated areas with SMVs, DMVs and MMVs, again in close proximity to LDs, whereas phenotype 2 (complex membrane structures lacking organized morphology) was not found upon expression of ORF1.",

We first tested the expression of the different ORF1 proteins and their processing to assess the integrity of the polyproteins. In a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (S3A Fig) most of NS-proteins remained buried in precursors, which according to their sizes could represent the entire ORF1 and NS4-NS7 (S3A Fig). Mature cleavage products were only found for NS1-2 and/or NS3, however the size of these proteins was almost identical. This result was in line with previous data studying ORF1 in vitro processing of GII.4 [43, 52] . In addition, we assessed polyprotein expression and processing by Western blotting (WB) after transfection of the plasmids encoding the three ORF1 proteins into Huh7 T7 cells. We could detect cleavage products corresponding to NS3, (S3B To investigate membrane alterations resulting from huNoV nonstructural proteins, we expressed the complete ORF1 protein of the three GII.4 isolates in Huh7 T7 cells and performed EM analysis (Fig 3, S4 Fig) . As for MNV, the expression of ORF1 polyproteins resulted Huh7-CD300lf cells were infected (A, B) or mock infected (C) with MNV for 16 h (MOI = 1) before being chemically fixed and subjected to EM. Boxed and numbered areas are shown in higher magnification in subsequent panels. SMV, single membrane vesicle; DMV, double membrane vesicle; MMV, multi membrane vesicle; LD, lipid droplet. Note that SMVs are separated from the surrounding cytosol by a unique lipid bilayer. DMVs are delimited from the cytosol via two lipid bilayers and have a diameter below 300 nm. DMVs have normally a more electron-dense content than SMVs, likely due to engulfment of cytosolic content. MMVs contain more than 2 membranes. Yellow arrowheads indicate virions (Vi in the formation of complex vesicular structures for all three GII.4 isolates (Fig 3, S4 Fig) , similar to those found in MNV-infected cells (Fig 1, S2 Fig) and irrespective of the fixation technique used. The average diameter of DMVs was approximately 100-200 nm (Fig 3B) , and resembled structures found upon HCV and picornavirus infection [28, 31, [53] [54] [55] [56] . Most membrane alterations induced by ORF1 expression in Huh7 cells were again found in close association with LDs, similar to MNV. Overall, no consistent differences were found between ORF1 expression and infection regarding the ratio of SMVs, DMVs and MMVs ( Fig 3C) . However, high variability in vesicles size was observed among cells of the same condition, likely due to differences in protein abundance, time of infection, cell type, etc. Still, SMVs were by far the most abundant vesicle species in all conditions.",

SMVs (white), DMVs (yellow) and MMVs (blue) all appeared rather vesicular than tubular, were tightly attached to each other and mostly found adjacent to ER cisternae. In some serial slices, the membrane of a DMV was found still in continuation with the ER (Fig 4A, panel 2 ). MMVs were mainly generated by enwrapping of SMVs with tubular structures, most likely elongated or collapsed SMVs, appearing as multilamellar vesicles in cross-sections ( Fig 4B, panel 2) . Alternatively MMVs were originated as (NS) . The terminology in the boxes is used throughout this study. (B) Schematic representation of the protein expression model used in this study. Huh7 cells stably expressing T7-RNA polymerase are transfected with plasmids encoding ORF1 under transcriptional control of a T7 promoter and translational control of an EMCV IRES element, indicated by a secondary structure. Cytoplasmic expression of ORF1 proteins induces membrane alterations similar to infected cells in absence of RNA replication, indicated by a crossed box. (C) Huh7 T7 cells transfected with a construct expressing MNV ORF1 were processed for analysis by transmission EM (TEM) 20 h p.t. upon chemical fixation (CF) or high pressure freezing (HPF). Samples designated CF were grown on glass coverslips, fixed chemically with aldehydes, post-fixed with heavy metals, dehydrated with ethanol and resin embedded for further TEM analysis. Samples designated HPF were grown on sapphire discs, cryo-fixed by high pressure freezing, freeze substituted with heavy metals dissolved in acetone, dehydrated with acetone and resin embedded (reviewed in [97] ). Representative images of both fixation techniques are shown as specified on the left. Magnified views of the boxed areas are shown to the right and on top. Single membrane vesicles (SMVs), double membrane vesicles (DMVs), multi-membrane vesicles (MMVs), lipid droplets (LDs) and mitochondria (m) are indicated in the high magnification views. A tomographic xy slice of the yellow dashed area containing the cluster of vesicles is shown in (1) . Several virtual slices extracted from the tomogram of the green dashed area are shown in (2) . Note the continuity of the DMV membranes with the ER membrane (pink arrowheads). (B) Serial single xy slices through the tomogram shown in S2 Movie revealing the different membrane numbers of the vesicles within the cluster: from one lipid bilayer (SMVs) to two (DMVs) or more than two (MMVs).

Right: Higher magnification picture of the SMVs or DMVs engulfing pre-existing DMVs (Fig 4B, panel 3, 4) .

            "text": "The N-terminal protein of norovirus ORF1 is thought to induce membrane rearrangements and is considered to be involved in replication complex formation (reviewed in [8] ). First, we examined the localization of eGFP-NS1-2 with respect to subcellular markers by immunofluorescence ( Fig 5A) . Interestingly, eGFP-NS1-2 had a very peculiar filamentous subcellular distribution in most cells ( Fig 5A) . A minority of cells showed a focal distribution of NS1-2 or an intermediate phenotype (Fig 5A, white and yellow asterisk, respectively). Since the filamentous localization was observed for N-terminally HA-tagged NS1-2, an artifact caused by eGFP fusion can be excluded ( Fig 5C) . We found a significant co-localization of NS1-2 with a marker of the ER, judged by Pearson correlation values above 0.5 (Fig 5A and 5B ). Next, we used CLEM to determine the ultrastructural morphology of NS1-2-GFP positive structures ( Fig  5D) . Here, regions with strong eGFP fluorescence, indicating high NS1-2 expression, were represented by a network of tubular membrane protrusions. The absence of ribosomes associated with these structures, and the general co-localization of NS1-2 with an ER marker indicated that these membrane protrusions originated from the smooth ER. It is interesting to note that similar tubular structures can be induced by overexpression of ER-shaping proteins such as REEP1 and CLIMP-63 through direct interaction with microtubules [57] . However, we found no indication for a co-localization of NS1-2 induced ER-tubules with microtubules or intermediate filaments (S6C and S6D Note that we defined endosomes or MVBs as rounded organelles delimited from the cytosol by one lipid bilayer, containing a highly heterogeneous lumen composed of multiple vesicles with different sizes and electron densities. ALSs were defined as rounded organelles having two lipid bilayers that separate them from the cytosol and a diameter larger than 300 nm. Their lumen, in contrast to MVBs, was only composed of cytosolic content and/ or one engulfed vesicle. We cannot rule out, however, that ALSs are larger DMVs.",

Our results further illustrate differences in the subcellular localization and possible functions of NS1-2 proteins from different norovirus genogroups.",

NS3 significantly colocalized with markers of the Golgi apparatus, rough ER and LDs (Fig 6A and 6C ). We also characterized the subcellular localization of NS3 upon expression of ORF1 ( Fig 6B) . Donut like structures of NS3 observed in IF were indeed NS3-studded membrane layers surrounding LDs (area 1). Interestingly, large foci with strong NS3 but weak LD signal were found to represent highly ordered membrane proliferations and were often observed in close proximity to one or more LDs (area 2, 3). Such convoluted membranes were similar to previously described OSER (organized smooth ER) membranes with cubic symmetry (reviewed in [58, 59] ). However, we did not observe these structures upon ORF1 expression (Fig 3) . Overall, our findings indicate that GII.4 NS3 was found on different membrane compartments of the secretory pathway and was closely associated to intracellular lipid storage compartments.",

Maximumintensity Z-projection of a selected cell is shown on the top. eGFP-NS1-2 signal is depicted in green, LDs in red and the nucleus (DAPI) in blue. Samples were subsequently processed for electron microscopy by using the coordinates etched onto the surface of the gridded coverslips to record the position of the selected cells. The correlated panel was obtained by re-orientation and superimposition of light and electron micrographs as described in M&M. Boxed and numbered areas are shown in higher magnification in subsequent panels. White scale bars, 5 \u03bcm. eGFP-NS4 signal tended to accumulate in larger clusters compared to the majority of eGFP-NS3 (Fig 7A and 7B ), but also co-localized with markers of ER, Golgi apparatus and LDs (Fig 7A and 7B ). CLEM analysis identified several interesting types of membrane alterations in areas with strong eGFP signal, in agreement with the idea that NS4 is a key driver in the formation of the norovirus replication compartment. Donut like structures were found to be membranes tightly associated with LDs ( Fig 7B, area 2) , similar to those found for NS3 ( Fig  6B) . In addition, large eGFP-NS4 positive foci found in close proximity to LDs consisted of vesicle clusters composed of DMVs and SMVs (Fig 7B, area 3, 4 ; 7C, area 5). The size and morphology of NS4 induced DMVs was very similar to those observed upon expression of the polyprotein (Fig 7D compared to Fig 3B) , but their abundance was apparently lower. In contrast, SMVs were much more abundant and heterogeneous in size, with a diameter ranging from 50 nm to 300 nm, although more than~80% had a diameter <100 nm ( Fig 7E) . These data suggested that NS4 on its own was capable of inducing vesicle accumulations reminiscent of vesicle clusters of the GII.4 replication compartment. Finally, similarly to NS3, highly fluorescent clusters of NS4 within the cells corresponded to regions forming regularly shaped membrane lattices (Fig 7C, areas 6 and 7) . However, NS4 expression resulted in membranes aligned predominantly in tubules with hexagonal symmetry (Fig 7C, area 6 ). This hexagonal symmetry appeared very similar to the arrangement observed upon overexpression of the hydroxy-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase [60] , although regions with cubic symmetry were also observed ( Fig 7C, area 7) . Furthermore, NS4 induced crystalline membrane structures were found in proximity to vesicle clusters ( Fig 7C, area 1) , suggesting that their formation might be concentration dependent and a consequence of very high local concentrations of NS4.",

Since the functions of all three proteins, in particular NS1-2 and NS4, are widely enigmatic, we next aimed to generate structural models based on secondary structure analysis and homology searches, allowing for the development of hypotheses accessible to experimental validation. There are no close homologs of known structures for these three proteins, but advanced search methods unambiguously detect distant homologs (20% sequence identity) for parts of both NS1-2 and NS3. These together with secondary structure predictions show that the 334-residue NS1-2 can be described as a three-partite protein with an unstructured N-terminus (residues 1-110) followed by a papain-like thiol hydrolase domain (residues ca 120-230) that is related to a family of phospholipases and acyltransferases [61] , and finally a hydrophobic domain (residues ca 250-310) with one or possibly two transmembrane helices. We can thus draw two possible topologies for membrane association of NS1-2 ( Fig 8A) . Interestingly, the catalytic cysteine and histidine of the putative thiol hydrolase are both present in NS1-2 as C205 and H139. The 366-residue NS3 is a distant homolog of AAA ATPases with an extra 50 residues at the N-terminus comprising a hydrophobic helix that could be transmembrane. Again, we have two possibilities for NS3 membrane association. Finally, we could find no homolog of known structure for the 179-residue NS4, but secondary structure predictions show that its approximately 140 N-terminal residues are highly structured and end in an amphipathic helix connecting to a natively unfolded C-terminus (Fig 8A) .",

Since these residues are invariant in all norovirus genogroups, we used MNV as a surrogate model to study their functional importance for norovirus replication. Interestingly, both NS1-2 mutants affected the abundance of the filamentous phenotype ( Fig 8B-8D) , arguing for a contribution of the putative hydrolase domain to the generation of tubular ER protrusions. Albeit mutations H139A and C205A both resulted in an increased abundance of the intermediate phenotype, or a focal distribution of eGFP-NS1-2, all variants still remained localized to the ER (Fig 8E) . Importantly, both residues were indeed essential for norovirus replication, as mutations at the corresponding positions H150A and C216A of MNV NS1-2 abrogated the production of infectious virus (Fig 8F) .",

We found in principle the same two phenotypes upon MNV infection of Huh7-CD300lf cells and in RAW 264.7 cells. ORF1 expression induced structures very similar to the phenotype lacking virions, likely corresponding to an early/intermediate infection stage, but did not progress into the complex endomembrane system observed concomitantly to intracellular virions appearance. Progression to the late stages found in infection might require the presence of the structural proteins or resemble cytopathic effects induced by infection, but not by ORF1 expression. Interestingly, we found no obvious Parts for which modeling is most reliable are displayed in secondary structure representation: First the two domains that were homology modeled, namely the central domain of NS1-2 (the catalytic C205 and H139 residues are displayed as spheres) and the NTPase domain of NS3; Second the membrane difference in the membrane rearrangements induced by ORF1 or MNV compared to any of the three GII.4 isolates included in this study, arguing for similar mechanisms driving these processes in various norovirus genogroups and validating MNV as a useful surrogate model to study particular aspects of general norovirus biology. Still, our data obtained upon GII.4 ORF1 expression will ultimately require validation in a cell culture model with bona fide RNA replication, such as the recently established enteric organoid cultures [43] or infection of B cells [42] . The same holds true for the functional significance of the LD association we found for GII.4 NS3 and NS4. While LDs are clearly not essential for MNV replication, since they are not detectable in RAW 264.7 cells, we found them close to all virus induced membrane alterations in Huh7 cells, both, upon expression of ORF1 and upon MNV infection. Whether this is co-incidence due to high LD abundance in Huh7 cells or whether LDs have a functional significance in GII.4 replication remains to be determined. At this point we have not been able to detect membrane alterations that could unequivocally be assigned to norovirus infection by EM in norovirus infected enteroid cultures (S. Boulant, personal communication), likely due to the yet limited efficiency of this model and the high percentage of infected cells required for a thorough EM analysis. However, further optimization of culture conditions will hopefully allow such studies in the future, as well as the establishment of a reverse genetics model for GII.4 isolates.",

            "text": "Our ultrastructural analysis does not allow drawing firm conclusions on the origin and biogenesis of GII.4 induced SMVs, since we did not observe such vesicles directly connected to cellular membranes. In contrast to PV, we could not find evidence for an interconnected tubular network [55] . Most of our evidence points to membranes of the ER as the origin of SMVs, similar to MNV [15] , due to the co-localization of NS1-2 and NS3 with ER membranes when expressed in the context of ORF1. Furthermore, our tomograms reveal a close proximity of the induced vesicles to ER membranes. Finally, individually expressed NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 all at least in part co-localize to and rearrange ER membranes. Therefore, huNoV, like many other viruses, may hijack this cell organelle to generate its replication organelles (reviewed in [62] ). Regarding DMVs and MMVs, we were able to identify intermediate structures. Many vesicles appearing as DMVs in a single plane were in fact MMVs in stato nascendi, generated by enwrapping vesicles with collapsed, elongated SMVs or ER cisternae. DMVs might originate as well from collapsing SMVs. This indeed closely resembles the mechanisms demonstrated for picornaviruses [55, 56] . Finally, our tomograms also showed a variety of complex structures (e.g. MVBs, ALS) that might be linked to the biogenesis of these vesicles, however these structures are currently difficult to interpret regarding their functional significance. Overall, our data suggest that norovirus induced membrane alterations are very closely related association helices of the three proteins. For NS1-2, the alternate possibilities for its C-terminal membrane association, as one membrane-peripheral and one transmembrane helix, or as two transmembrane helices, are indicated by a question mark. Similarly for NS3, the alternate possibilities for its N-terminal helix as transmembrane or as membrane-peripheral are indicated with a question mark. The natively unfolded N-terminus of NS1-2 and Cterminus of NS4 are displayed as random coils. The N-terminus of NS4, folded according to secondary structure predictions but with no homolog of known structure, is displayed as a blob with a putative amphipathic helix leading to the unstructured C-terminus in secondary structure representation. (B-E) pTM plasmids encoding NS1-2 variants as indicated N-terminally fused to eGFP were transfected into Huh7-T7 cells and harvested 20 hours post transfection. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with Triton-X100 (0.5%), and ER (red) was stained using a RTN-3 monoclonal antibody. to picornavirus replication organelles with respect to both morphology and biogenesis. The relatively low abundance of DMVs and MMVs further argues for a non-essential role in norovirus infection, again in line with reports on picornaviruses, where replication most likely occurs on single membrane structures, whereas the appearance of DMVs is associated with later stages of infection [55, 56] .",

The sequence of NS1-2 is highly divergent between different norovirus genogroups with no specific function assigned thus far. Bioinformatic analysis proposed an unstructured N-terminal region, which was confirmed biochemically [9] , a central domain with potential hydrolase function [10] and a C-terminal transmembrane domain [9, 63] . Norwalk virus NS1-2 was shown to disrupt the Golgi apparatus [11] , whereas MNV NS1-2 mainly localizes to the ER [13] . Our data now show a very peculiar filamentous localization of GII.4 NS1-2 which could be identified as tubular protrusions of the smooth ER when analyzed by CLEM. Similar structures have been observed upon overexpression of cellular ER remodeling proteins such as REEP1 and CLIMP-63 through direct interaction with microtubules [57] , which appear to be the driving force in protruding the tubules. In the case of NS1-2, we found no co-localization with microtubules or intermediate filaments, therefore it is currently not clear how the ERtubules are expanded. Since mutations in the active site of the putative hydrolase domain severely affected the formation of the tubular ER-protrusions, it is tempting to speculate about a role of this predicted enzymatic function in the membrane shaping activity of NS1-2. However, the functional significance of the ability of GII.4 NS1-2 to form filamentous ER tubules still remains unclear, since MNV NS1/2 is devoid of this property. Overall these data are suggestive for the presence of an enzymatic activity residing in NS1-2, but they clearly provide no formal proof, which will require the demonstration of such activity in a purified protein. Interestingly, a recent study identified an interaction of the variable, unstructured N-terminus of MNV NS1/2 with the host proteins VAPA and VAPB, critical for viral replication [64] . VAPA has already been observed to complex with Norwalk NS1-2 [65] , presumably via a different, yet to be defined region. More strikingly, VAPA and VAPB have been implicated in the biogenesis of the HCV replication compartment via interaction with NS5A (reviewed in [23] ). Therefore, VAPA and VAPB interactions might contribute to the function of NS1-2 in the formation of the norovirus replication organelle, or even be a common host factor of many DMV-type positive strand RNA viruses.",

Interestingly, similar structures have been found upon expression of HAV 2C and 2BC, with the former regarded as the functional counterpart of norovirus NS3 in picornaviruses [34] . These structures clearly resemble OSER membranes with cubic (NS3) and hexagonal (NS4) symmetry. It has been reported that OSER structures can be generated through weak protein-protein interactions, which can even be triggered by overexpression of GFP tagged to cytochrome b(5), with the GFP moiety providing the homotypic interactions [66] . Therefore, we currently cannot exclude that the fusion of NS3 and NS4 with eGFP, required for CLEM, also contributed to this phenotype. However, it seems unlikely that these structures are essential for viral replication, since they have not been observed so far in either MNV infected cells or upon ORF1 overexpression [15, 44] . Therefore, the ability of NS3 and NS4 to induce cubic membranes might point to an intrinsic property, probably weak homotypic interactions, and seems to be linked to strong overexpression of single NS proteins. Upon ORF1 expression and virus infection, such structures might be prevented due to the interactions among NS-proteins and by lower local concentrations of individual NS-proteins. Also in the case of HAV, cubic membranes were only found upon 2C/ 2BC overexpression [34] but not in HAV infected cells [28] .",

A similar localization pattern was previously found for MNV NS3 in Vero cells, but not tested for LD localization at that point [13] . Interestingly, NS1-2 co-localized to NS3 on LDs in most cells upon expression of ORF1, whereas this LD association was never found upon sole expression of GII.4 NS1-2. This result argues for an additional role of NS3 in recruiting NS1-2 upon formation of the viral replication organelle, probably involving direct interactions. The recently observed localization of MNV NS3 with microtubules and cholesterol rich lipids when transiently expressed in Vero cells [45, 46] further argues for a function of NS3 in shaping the replication organelle. Whether or not the NTPase activity, which has been demonstrated for the NS3 protein of GI.1 [14] , is important for localization and membrane activity of NS3 remains to be determined. However, the most obvious putative function of NS3 in RNA replication is a supposed helicase activity, suggested by conserved SF3 helicase motifs [67] . Still to date, only the related 2C protein from the picornavirus Enterovirus 71 has been shown to function as an ATP dependent helicase [68] .",

            "text": "NS4 is by far the most enigmatic among the norovirus NS proteins and little is currently known about its structure or function. Here, we provide the first direct experimental evidence suggesting that NS4 indeed might be the central organizer of the norovirus replication complex. In contrast to HCV, where all NS proteins can induce the formation of vesicular structures [31], NS4 was, in our hands, the only GII.4 protein capable of vesicle formation upon individual expression. In addition, SMVs and DMVs were found, similar to MNV infection and ORF1 expression, albeit with differing abundance. Altogether, these data suggest that NS4 may be the key driver in the formation of norovirus induced replication vesicles, requiring auxiliary functions of NS1-2 and NS3 to finally shape the replication organelles. This is reminiscent of HCV, where the complexity of the so called membranous web is only found upon expression of a polyprotein precursor encoding NS3 to NS5B, arguing for a concerted action engaging several NS-proteins [31, 33] . In the case of picornaviruses, 2BC [27], 2BC/3A [26], 2C [34, 69] and 3AB [35] have been found to generate distinct membrane alterations upon individual expression, with 2BC/3A and 3AB generating DMVs. However the ultrastructure of the replication organelles is far more complex upon infection also in case of picornaviruses [55] . Still, it is interesting to note that the unrelated proteins NS5A of HCV and 3A of PV are capable of inducing DMVs and share a similar structural organization. Specifically, both contain a unique structured region lacking enzymatic functions, which has been resolved for HCV NS5A [70] and PV 3A [71] , an intrinsically unfolded region engaged in recruitment of host factors [72] [73] [74] and a membrane attachment region. Our current prediction for the organization of NS4, albeit highly speculative at this point, is strikingly similar regarding subdomain organization and functions (Fig 8A) . This model will provide a valuable starting point for further in depth studies regarding the function of norovirus NS4.",

However, a far more detailed analysis of polyprotein cleavage kinetics using a different GII.4 strain suggests a number of cleavage intermediates with NS4, including NS4-NS7, NS4-NS6 and NS4-NS5 [52] , which might serve specific functions in the norovirus replication cycle. It is particularly tempting to speculate that delayed cleavage of NS4-NS7 might avoid diffusion of the replicase components, since NS4 seems the only protein associated with membranes in this precursor protein.",

While our predictions are in favor of one transmembrane domain for both, the NS1-2 and NS3 proteins, this topology would require a post-cleavage membrane insertion to keep the cleavage site accessible to NS6. Alternatively, and still in line with the predictions, NS1-2 could span the membrane twice and NS3 may harbor an amphipathic alpha helix tethering the protein to membranes, thereby keeping the NS6 cleavage site in the cytoplasm. Regardless, the transmembrane topology of NS1-2 and NS3 can be experimentally addressed in future studies using our expression model and, for example, testing the accessibility of N-and C-termini to proteases in cell lysates.",

Thereby, the contribution of viral NS-proteins could be clearly defined [31, 33] in addition to the importance of host factors like PI4KA [75, 76] . Only expression models allowed us to identify viral membrane alterations as targets of direct antiviral agents (NS5A inhibitors [37] ) and host targeting drugs including PI4KA inhibitors [75] and cyclophilin inhibitors [38] . Similar approaches might help to identify novel strategies to develop drugs targeting norovirus replication in future studies.

The non-structured N-terminus and helical C-terminus were then generated with PyMOL 1.8.2.0 [91] . The three parts were assembled in PyMOL with the PyMOL sculpting function. NS3 was modelled with I-Tasser [92] and NS4 was modelled with RaptorX [93] , with default parameters.
