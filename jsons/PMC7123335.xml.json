Some patients may not develop fever, and hypothermia, i.e. <36 \u00b0C, can also be a sign of sepsis. If an outpatient with symptoms that could be sepsis-related reports a normal body temperature, it should be checked again in the clinic with a reliable thermometer and correct method. Diarrhoea and vomiting are frequently seen in sepsis but can easily be mistaken for gastroenteritis, mucositis or acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD). Diffuse or local pain, e.g. in the abdomen, is common. Falls are often secondary to sepsis particularly in elderly patients. Any of these indices need prompt and thorough assessment.",

Cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan and thiotepa are among the most commonly used drugs in conditioning regimens and the major drug-related cause of HC. Use of other alkylating agents and etoposide may also increase the risk of HC. When cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide is metabolised in the body, it produces a metabolite called acrolein. Acrolein will cause direct toxicity to the inner lining of the urinary tract, the urothelium. The degree of damage is dose dependent, and the toxicity may increase with previous or concomitant radiation therapy and if busulfan is included in the conditioning regimen together with cyclophosphamide. The time of duration that acrolein is exposed to the bladder also contributes to the degree of damage. For cyclophosphamide, the maximal concentration of active metabolites is reached after 2\u20134 h of oral or intravenous administration. Most of the cyclophosphamide, 35\u201380% of the dose, is excreted in the urine as metabolites, and up to 20% is excreted as intact drug (Hassan and Ljungman 2003). In patients with decreased renal function, particularly in severe cases, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites. This can cause increased toxicity. The following substances may also increase the concentration of toxic metabolites, possibly through inhibited breakdown or decreased renal excretion: allopurinol, cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide and HIV protease inhibitors.",

Catheterisation and bladder irrigation with 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) may be necessary to prevent clot obstruction. Catheter insertion should be performed so that the risk of additional injury to the urothelium is minimised. Treatment with bladder instillation of various compounds such as formalin, alum, silver nitrate, sodium hyalonurate, prostaglandins, GM-CSF, fibrin glue, cidofovir, ciprofloxacin or ribavirin has been reported as effective, but experiences are still limited (Carreras 2012). If obstruction occurs, cystoscopy can be performed. Selective embolisation of bladder arteries and catheterisation of both ureters to rest the bladder are actions that can be taken in severe cases. Cystectomy remains the last resort if all other treatment attempts fail.",

The metabolites trigger the activation, damage and inflammation of the endothelial cells lining the sinusoids (sinusoids being small capillary-like blood vessels in the liver). This trigger mechanism can start as soon as the conditioning treatment is administered. The activated sinusoidal endothelial cells release inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and the enzyme heparanase which break down the extracellular matrix that supports the structure of the sinusoids. The endothelial cells are then forced to round up, and gaps form between the cells. The gaps allow for red blood cells, white blood cells and other cellular debris to exit through these gaps in the sinusoid walls into the space of Disse. (The space of Disse is the perisinusoidal space that is located between the endothelium and the hepatocytes.) When cells and debris accumulate in this space, the sinusoids become narrower. Due to the sinusoidal damage, endothelial cells can dissect off and embolise further downstream thus contribute to the narrowing. The damage also leads to an increase in the expression of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). This coagulopathy causes an increase in clot formation and a decrease in the breakdown of clots. The deposition of fibrin and the clot formation will contribute to the narrowing of the sinusoids and may ultimately lead to hepatic sinusoidal obstruction. The result is SOS/VOD which is characterised by obstruction of the sinusoids, portal vein hypotension and reduced hepatic venous outflow. Severe cases can progress to multi-organ dysfunction (MOD)/multi-organ failure (MOF) and death.",

Some reasons are lack of sensitivity and specificity of the criteria, the dynamic manifestations that makes definition of the condition hard and that early signs and symptoms often are subtle and makes differentiation from other transplant complications difficult. Given the poor prognosis of severe SOS/VOD, it is however vital to identify mild cases before they progress to moderate, with signs of hepatic injury and requiring more aggressive intervention, or further progress to severe SOS/VOD with MOD/MOF. The most recent diagnostic criteria proposed by EBMT (Mohty et al. 2016) are the same as the Baltimore criteria (Jones et al. 1987) for classical SOS/VOD with onset within the first 3 weeks after HSCT, but if SOS/VOD develops after day +21, elevated serum bilirubin level is not always seen, why a modified version of the criteria can be used for diagnosis of late SOS/VOD (Mohty et al. 2016) (Table 9.4). The EBMT criteria will also better capture the dynamic manifestations of the disease and thus facilitate an early diagnosis as well as a more accurate assessment of severity.

Other syndromes in this group have been named engraftment syndrome (ES), diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and transplant-associated microangiopathy (TMA). The similarities in their clinical manifestations and the lack of established diagnostic criteria often make determination of incidence and differential diagnosis difficult (Soubani and Pandya 2010; Afessa et al. 2012).

Contributing factors are the conditioning treatment and use of other drugs such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), e.g. cyclosporine-A, and microbial products translocated through mucosal barriers. The result is that fluid and proteins leak out of tiny blood vessels and flow into surrounding tissues. If unrecognised, this may lead to dangerously low blood pressure and subsequently MOF and shock. The symptoms often appear around the time of neutrophil recovery, i.e. when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) increases to \u22650.5 \u00d7 109/L, which is why the complex process of engraftment may also play a role in activation of endothelial cell damage. The activation of the endothelial cells leads to further damage and inflammation by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Since the incidence of vascular endothelial syndromes is higher after allogeneic transplantation, alloreactivity (the immune response to non-self cells) is considered to play a role in activation and damage of endothelial cells.",

These symptoms are due to endothelial dysfunction causing small vessels thrombosis in the microcirculation. TAM is a multi-visceral disease most often affecting the kidneys, but pulmonary, gastrointestinal and central nervous system (CNS) involvement can also be seen. Complement system dysregulation plays an important role in the severity of TAM. Defects in the complement system lead to formation of the lytic complex C5b-9.
