IBV is the causal agent of infectious bronchitis (IB), which is characterised by respiratory, renal and/or reproductive disease. 1 Clinical signs may be associated with deaths of broiler chickens and reduced eggshell and albumen quality in layer hens, leading to economic losses for poultry farmers. Several different IBV strains have been isolated and classified 2-8 since IB was first identified in the United States in the 1930s. 9 Notably, IBV strains have been constantly diverging, although distinct and diverse sublineages can be exclusive to a single country such as Australia. 8, 10, 11 There is no treatment for IB, so prevention is the most effective way to control spread of the disease. As IBV transmission is airborne, 12 biosecurity alone is not always an effective control measure, so vaccination protocols involving the use of live virus vaccines are widely used. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Four live vaccines are available in Australia: vaccines I, S and VicS belong to antigenic subtype B 11, 18 and vaccine A is classified as subtype C. The first Australian vaccine produced and applied was the VicS, which was developed from an Australian nephropathogenic IBV strain that causes nephrosis/nephritis in young chicks. 8 The original isolate from which the two other subtype B vaccines, S and I, were derived is unreported; however, nucleotide sequence analysis of their S1 genes indicates that all three vaccines are genetically identical. 19, 20 The VicS vaccine has been used nationally since the 1960s to vaccinate 1-day-old chicks, primarily in broiler chickens and breeder flocks. Because inactivated IB vaccines have not been available in Australia, layer chickens were not vaccinated against IBV until recently because of concerns that live vaccines may affect laying performance and egg quality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 728, "end": 730, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 731, "end": 734, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1032, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1037, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1042, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1047, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1151, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1602, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In Australia, there has been ongoing evaluation of the possible role of IBV in egg quality and production. 21, 22 Circumstantial evidence has lead to the large-scale adoption of IBV vaccination in Australian layer flocks (Peter Scott, Scolexia Avian and Animal Health Consultancy, pers. comm.).

High-quality eggs have high Haugh units, with thicker albumen, or egg white, in relation to total egg weight than low-quality eggs. 21 Factors reported to influence Haugh units include chicken breed, age, feed and disease status, in particular infection by IBV, the storage time and temperature of the eggs, and the presence of fungal toxins. [23] [24] [25] Very early international observations showed an association between IBV infection and a decline in egg quality and egg production, 26 but the tropism of Australian strains of IBV for the reproductive tract, and the associated effect on egg quality and production, is unclear. Studies have shown that IBV may be associated with a decline in egg production and deterioration in shell and albumen quality, but with only mild or no respiratory signs, 27 and two Australian field IBV strains have been shown to reduce the quality and quantity of eggs produced by some hens. 28, 29 Current Australian IBV vaccines have been shown to have no effect on egg quality or production. 30 New strains of IBV arise commonly because of the frequent recombination of and spontaneous mutations in its single-stranded RNA. 3, [31] [32] [33] Most Australian IBV strains characterised to date have been isolated from broiler chickens, with over 50 IBV strains belonging to a dozen serotypes identified within the past 30 years. 8, 10, 11, [34] [35] [36] At present, the most common method used for IBV detection and characterisation in Australian poultry involves PCR of the IBV 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) followed by high-resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis. 19 Using this technique, three predominant subgroups of IBV have been established. Subgroup 1 strains include the vaccine and vaccine-related strains (>95% sequence similarity), subgroup 2 strains include the variant field isolates detected in the 1980s 10 and subgroup 3 strains include variant field isolates detected more recently. 7 All other strains are considered 'variant field strains'; however, vaccine A and V3/02 (which is the representative vaccine A-related field isolate, GenBank accession number DQ490217) -related field strains (>95% sequence similarity) could be considered a separate subgroup. Isolation of V3/02-related field strains from broiler chicken flocks has been common in the past 10 years, often associated with nephritis and increased mortality. 20 Accurate detection and determination of the IBV types in Australian layer flocks is necessary for implementation of effective control measures and for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of IBVs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 451, "end": 455, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 456, "end": 460, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 461, "end": 465, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1038, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1272, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1277, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1282, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1287, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1475, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1479, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1483, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1488, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1493, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1498, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This investigation used the PCR/HRM technique to detect and characterise IBV strains circulating in Australian layer hens in order to determine if the presence of IBV in a layer flock was related to reduced egg quality and/or production.

Although IBV was detected in layer hens throughout this study, detection of IBV in a flock was not associated with clinical signs of disease, which potentially indicates recurrent subclinical infection because of some vaccinal immunity in the flock. 1 Three of the IBVs detected were determined to be variant strains by nucleotide sequencing, because of the large deletions of varying sizes in the 3\u2032 UTR. This is not surprising, because the variability of this region in IBVs has been widely reported. 19, 20, 39, 40 The 3\u2032 UTR nucleotide sequencing was not successful for the IBV present in five of the pooled submissions and we suspect that this is most likely related to a low level of viral RNA present in the original submissions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 435, "end": 438, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1186, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1190, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1194, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It would have been beneficial to also sequence the S1 gene of each IBV detected, but our ability to produce this data was hampered by the varying quality of the RNA in the submissions. Sequencing of the S1 gene was also inhibited by the need to amplify the entire S1 gene (\u2248 1600 bp) for comparison. Partial S1 gene sequencing is unreliable for strain characterisation because of the extensively reported ability of IBVs to recombine in the S1 gene region. [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] For ease of sampling and processing, we decided that dry swabs would be more practical for the collection, storage and shipment of specimens by farmers, although it precluded isolation of live virus. The use of transport media to facilitate virus isolation was considered, but was thought to reduce the farmers' willingness to participate in this survey, because of the need to keep and ship the samples on ice, which would subsequently hinder the regularity of submissions and reduce the number of specimens collected. Upon arrival at the laboratory, however, the swabs were placed directly into lysis buffer for extraction of viral RNA and HRM curve analysis, and when a positive result was recorded, further swabs and/or tissue placed into transport media were requested. Numerous efforts were made throughout this study to obtain an isolate of IBV from layer flocks identified as IBV positive, but IBV could not be isolated from cloacal or oviduct swabs or directly from oviduct tissue of chickens after multiple passages through embryonated chicken eggs.

Serological analysis would not have provided useful data, because all flocks except for two were vaccinated multiple times to maintain high levels of IB immunity. Thus, although virus challenge might have occurred in immune hens, it would not have been detected in serological assays such as ELISA because there would be little detectable changes in the dominant cross-reactive antibodies. Only tests that detect IBV serotype-specific antibodies are useful for such purposes, and such tests are difficult and laborious. Therefore, PCR analysis, which is a simple and fast technique, was performed instead to detect the presence of viral RNA. This technique was successfully able to detect IBV RNA and hence identify IBV strains that were present in the hens at the time of sampling. The lack of recovery of an IBV isolate from layer chickens could also reflect the short duration and transitory nature of IBV infection, which is known to occur in immune hens. 22 Various other factors besides IBV infection (e.g. nutritional deficiencies, concurrent disease challenge, hen age, egg storage temperature, time delay and humidity) can affect the Haugh unit measurement of an egg. [23] [24] [25] 46, 47 The timeline of experimental IBV infection and its relationship to when poor-quality eggs are detected indicates that a drop in egg production and egg shell quality becomes apparent during the second week after infection and may last for 2-4 weeks; 48 hence the effect occurs some time after virus has ceased replicating. How and when the Haugh units were measured for data collected on farm could not be controlled for this study, but based on discussions with each farmer, the data collected were assessed in line with standard procedures (Haugh units assessed against industry standards for hens' breed and age) to ensure the highest possible accuracy of the assessment of internal egg quality. Although these factors and inconsistencies lead to the conclusion that measurement of Haugh units is too subjective to be an effective measure of internal egg quality, measurement of the Haugh units, correlated with hen age, is the current industry standard for determination of egg quality.

This could suggest that potentially some Australian IBVs may have tropism for the oviduct, causing the production of poor-quality eggs with reduced albumen quality. Although in controlled studies some Australian IBV strains have been shown to grow in and damage oviductal tissues, 29, 30 there has not been a successful isolation of a field strain of IBV from the oviduct of layer hens producing poor-quality eggs. Often other factors, besides infectious pathogens such as IBV, are involved in the production of poorquality eggs. 21 Our study identified flock type as a potential risk factor; however, this risk factor is related to flock size (i.e. caged hens are housed at a higher density than free-range hens and therefore caged flocks are generally larger than free-range flocks). In terms of the effect of chicken breed on Haugh units, comparisons of Hy-line Brown, Hisex and Isa Brown hens have consistently demonstrated that eggs produced by Hisex and Isa Brown hens have lower Haugh units than eggs produced by other brown-egg layers. 29, 47 All farms practised varying IB vaccination protocols. In some cases, live vaccines I and VicS were used, but in other cases, live vaccines I, VicS and A were used in various combinations at different ages.
