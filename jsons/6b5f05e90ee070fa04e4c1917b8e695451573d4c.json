At the time of release of this statement, as per the available global statistics, more than 1.5 million had infection and around 87000 had died [1] . The corresponding figures in India are 4714 and 149 respectively [2] . There is a distinct possibility of COVID-19 overwhelming the healthcare capacity of India. The measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 such as social-distancing, hand hygiene, surveillance, and isolation of persons suspected or confirmed to have infection have been considered to be largely effective. In this regard, Government authorities have issued guidelines to health care workers and to the public at large, uniformly advising strict adherence to above measures and acknowledge the limited role of drugs in the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.",

HCQ is considered to be safer than chloroquine based on clinical studies [3, 4] . This drug has now found place in management of COVID-19 infection [3e10]. It has been observed to inhibit ACE2 receptor-mediated entry of the SARS-CoV2 virus through various actions such as raising of intravesicular pH, inhibiting lysosomal activity, affecting antigen processing, etc. [3e7]. In addition, it has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator actions which could be relevant in the crisis generated by cytokines storm during COVID-19 infection [8e10] .",

This side effect is rare, but coprescription of other drugs such as azithromycin (which is also being recommended for the treatment of COVID-19) could amplify this risk. Many other drugs such as quinolones, antihistamines etc. which are often used may also add to the risk of TdP (refer to https://www.crediblemeds.org/drugsearch for list of drugs associated with QT prolongation).
