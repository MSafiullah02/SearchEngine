The resulting transmission trees provide unique insights into the individual variation in the number of secondary cases generated by an infected index case. A better understanding of this variation provides crucial information about epidemic spread, the expected number of superspreading events, and the effects of control measures.2\n",

Fitting a negative binomial distribution to the data (appendix) provides maximum-likelihood estimates of the mean (0\u00b795, 95% CI 0\u00b757\u20131\u00b734) and the dispersion parameter (k=0\u00b718, 95% CI 0\u00b710\u20130\u00b726). The mean corresponds to the basic reproduction number (R\n0) of the overall population. The estimated value of k, which is substantially smaller than 1, suggests that the distribution of the individual reproduction number is highly overdispersed.2 The value for Ebola virus disease is similar to that estimated for severe acute respiratory syndrome (k=0\u00b716).2 This finding suggests that superspreading events for Ebola virus disease are an expected feature of the individual variation in infectiousness.3\n",
