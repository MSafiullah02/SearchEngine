Although not possible to\norganise for all emergency departments, a dedicated entry point and triage for\ncardiovascular emergencies (chest pain unit) might prove advantageous to\naccelerate diagnosis and treatment. Separate teams providing care in each of\nthese areas might reduce the risk of cross-contaminations as important as\nmaintaining separate areas throughout the hospital for both Covid-19-positive\nand negative patients for further care.
