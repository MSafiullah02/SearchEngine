In Taiwan, the average annual incidence of patients hospitalized with pneumonia was 1240 with 6.7 mortalities per 100,000 children younger than 18 years of age, costing NT$1,475,000,000 (about US$49 million) per year.1 Occasionally, a child may develop an opaque pulmonary consolidation with unusually round shape, which raises the concern of a tumor in the chest, causing anxiety to the pediatrician and parents. Herein, we report the case of a patient with so-called \u201cround pneumonia\u201d, whose initial chest X-ray (CXR) findings mimicked those of a lung mass, but subsequently showed complete response to oral antibiotics alone. Recent findings and recommendations in the literature are also reviewed.",

There were also mild streaking infiltrates in bilateral lower lung fields, especially the perihilar regions, while no pleural effusion was noted (Figures 1\nand 2\nA). Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 9800/\u03bcL with left shift (metamyelocyte 5%, band-form 5%, segmented neutrophils 68%, lymphocytes 7%, atypical lymphocytes 1%, and monocytes 14%), a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, platelets count of 173 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, a C-reactive protein level of 8.7 mg/dL, with normal electrolytes, blood sugar, lactate dehydrogenase, and uric acid levels, renal and liver function tests, and peripheral blood smear. Under the working diagnosis of round pneumonia, the patient was suggested to be hospitalized and undergo antimicrobial therapy. However, due to family reasons, his mother requested that he be treated as an outpatient. His subjective abdominal pain had improved after an enema and intravenous administration of metoclopramide, and he was discharged and given oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (87.5 mg amoxicillin/kg/day) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg/day).",

Although the exact term \u201cround pneumonia\u201d does not seem to be widely used by pediatricians in Taiwan, a previous study identified typical imaging features in 5% (2/39) of children with mycoplasmal pneumonia, whose lesions had been described as \u201cnodular or mass-like opacification\u201d.5\n",

As Taiwanese children's nasopharyngeal carriage rate of pneumococcus has decreased to approximately 10% with the advent of conjugate vaccines,8 urinary antigen positivity nowadays may serve as a reliable indicator of recent pneumococcal disease. By contrast, mycoplasmal pneumonia is prevalent in children older than 2\u20135 years of age,9 and its diagnosis in most clinical laboratories relies solely on serology.10 The patient's sera were tested with a microparticle agglutination assay (FTI Serodia Myco II; Fujirebio Taiwan Inc., Taoyuan, Taiwan), which detects both IgG and IgM simultaneously. The test was considered positive when the acute- and convalescent-phase sera showed a fourfold or higher increase in antibody titer, or when one sera had an antibody titer measurement of at least 1:160 (+),11, 12 as was the case in our patient. The test kit had a sensitivity of 48.1% and specificity of 86.9%,12 thereby indicating a high likelihood of concomitant M. pneumoniae infection in this child. However, neither imaging studies nor laboratory data can perfectly distinguish these two pathogens, and mixed infections are not uncommon in children with community-acquired pneuonia.8, 13 Therefore, combination therapy was given to treat both pathogens.",
