Whilst most bacterial CNS infections induce a purulent inflammation, some bacteria, particularly Listeria spp., as well as protozoa, fungi and algae, cause a non-suppurative, mainly granulomatous inflammation of the CNS (Rand et al., 1994; Summers et al., 1995; Tipold, 1995; Quesnel et al., 1997). In the brains of beagles with granulomatous leptomeningitis, Maeda et al. (1993) demonstrated E. coli and considered it to be the causative agent. If parasites enter the CNS, they often induce a granulomatous inflammation (Summers et al., 1995). In dogs, the most common parasite to cause infection of the CNS is Toxoplasma gondii, followed by Neospora caninum and, albeit rarely, Cuterebra spp. In cats, Cuterebra spp. are the most common parasites to be found in the CNS, followed by T. gondii in rare cases (Braund, 2001).",

The type of inflammation was defined as follows: lymphohistiocytic, if infiltrates consisted mainly of lymphocytes and macrophages; granulomatous, if macrophages predominated; pyogranulomatous, if neutrophils and macrophages were the main cell types; and mixed, if macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils appeared in equal quantities.",

One of these dogs, and one cat also gave positive reactions with EMCV-specific antibodies (see also below). In four of the five dogs, severe neurological signs, including ataxia, convulsions and central blindness, had been recorded. No clinical data were available for the fifth dog. All four cats had shown neurological signs, reported in one case to consist of severe circling, hypermetria and blindness. In four of the five dogs and two of the four cats a moderate to severe meningoencephalitis affecting the grey and white matter was observed; this varied from granulomatous, pyogranulomatous, lymphohistiocytic to fibrinopurulent, occasionally associated with neuronal necrosis or malacia. In the remaining dog, inflammation was restricted to the grey matter of the cerebrum and cerebellum, being associated with severe malacia in the hippocampus. One cat showed mild focal, lymphocytic polioencephalitis and moderate focal, lymphohistiocytic meningitis, as well as severe vacuolation of the cerebral white matter and severe generalized neuronal necrosis. In another cat, severe, focal, fibrinopurulent meningitis and severe, acute neuronal necrosis in the hippocampus were observed.",

These immunohistochemical reactions were in general more intense with the anti-NSP-1 WNV antibody than with the anti-MEP-E WNV antibody. In some cases, immunoreactivity was observed with only one of these two WNV monoclonal antibodies. One dog showed immunoreactivity in pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA2 sector of the hippocampus, and another in the frontal cortex, respectively. A positive reaction in numerous macrophages and microglial cells in the midbrain, pons and frontal cerebrum was detected only with the anti-NSP-1 antibody. One dog showed WNV immunolabelling in numerous macrophages and microglial cells, and pyramidal cells in the cerebrum, hippocampus and midbrain, but only with the anti-NSP-1 antibody. Another dog, in contrast, showed immunoreactivity in a few neurons and macrophages in an inflamed part of the midbrain, but only with the anti-MEP-E antibody. One cat showed immunolabelling with both WNV antibodies in numerous neutrophils and occasional macrophages in the plexus chorioideus and laterally to the third ventricle. In this cat, small neurons, macrophages and microglial cells in the same brain region reacted only with the anti-NSP-1 antibody. In another cat, astrocytes and perivascular macrophages in the lobus parietalis reacted with both antibodies, whereas the anti-NSP-1 antibody additionally labelled pyramidal cells in the same brain region. In one cat, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes of the medulla oblongata displayed more abundant positive signals with the anti-NSP-1 antibody than with anti-MEP-E. Additionally, in this animal, the anti-NSP-1 antibody labelled large neurons in the medulla oblongata which failed to react with the anti-MEP-E antibody.",

Two domestic shorthairs, one Persian and one cat of unknown breed as well as a Landseer, a West Highland white terrier, a Bordeaux Dogge and an Entlebucher Sennenhund were affected. A granulomatous immune response was found in three of the four dogs. The remaining dog displayed a lymphohistiocytic chorioiditis and meningitis. Infiltration with macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells or pyogranulomatous inflammation was present in two of the four cats, and lymphohistiocytic inflammation in the remaining two cats. In three of these four dogs, severe neurological signs had been recorded; the fourth dog had shown dyspnoea and anaemia but no neurological signs. In three of the cats, neurological signs were recorded without reference to their severity. The fourth cat showed respiratory signs only. The eight animals showed different patterns of immunoreactivity. DAB precipitates were observed in the cytoplasm of perivascular and parenchymal macrophages, in the perikarya and processes of various neurons distant from or within the inflammatory lesions (Fig. 7\n), and in periventricular and submeningeal astrocytic foot processes (Fig. 8\n). In one dog and two cats, vessel-associated cells, probably pericytes or endothelial cells, showed immunolabelling (Fig. 9\n). Seven of the eight animals showed immunolabelling with the EMCV-specific monoclonal antibody (mab) 4F3; mab 3E5 gave results in selected cases only. One cat which was negative with the 4F3 antibody gave EMCV-specific reactions with mab 3E5. In one dog the results with mab 4F3 were confirmed with the mab 3E5.

In the 10 dogs referred to above, granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME) was suggested by the histopathological findings and distribution of lesions. In six of these cases, toy breeds were affected (two West Highland white terriers, two chihuahuas, a shih tzu and a rehpinscher). Interestingly, three of the affected dogs belonged to large breeds (Landseer, Bordeaux Dogge and collie), in which GME is only rarely reported (Braund, 1985).

            "text": "Surprisingly, five (9.4%) dogs and four (12%) cats showed immunolabelling for WNV. Histopathologically, these animals showed mild to moderate meningoencephalitis in the grey and white matter, mostly with granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation. In contrast, previous reports of WNV infection in birds and in mammals indicated that the grey matter was mainly affected and that the histopathology was characterized by lymphoplasmahistiocytic inflammation with small numbers of neutrophils (Steele et al., 2000; Cantile et al., 2001; Buchweitz et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2003; Lichtensteiger et al., 2003). Polyclonal WNV-specific antibodies used for immunolabelling often cross-react with other flaviviruses (Steele et al., 2000; Kelly et al., 2003; Chvala et al., 2004). The monoclonal antibodies specific for the major envelope protein E (anti-MEP) and non-structural protein 1 (anti-NSP-1) used in this study (Table 1, Table 2) cross-react with Kunjin virus, also a member of the Flaviviridae (Scherret et al., 2001). Presumably, the anti-NSP-1 antibody is more specific than the anti-MEP antibody (Hall, 2000). This might explain its stronger immunoreactivity in the present study and might support the identification of a WNV infection. The affected animals did not react positively for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus antigen with a polyclonal specific antibody that may cross-react with other flaviviruses (H. Weissenb\u00f6ck, personal communication). However, it is still possible that the positive WNV reaction was due to infection with other cross-reactive agents or represented molecular mimicry of host-derived antigens (Oldstone, 1998). The latter possibility receives some support from studies indicating that dogs and cats can be infected with WNV but usually develop only a low viraemia, without clinical signs or histopathological changes in the brain (Blackburn et al., 1989; Lichtensteiger et al., 2003; Austgen et al., 2004). Furthermore, no evidence of WNV infections in domestic animals has so far been detected in Germany. Therefore, the significance of the present findings requires further studies.",

After experimental infection with CPIV, viral antigen was detected in ependymal cells and neurons and in macrophages, in ferrets and dogs respectively (Baumg\u00e4rtner et al., 1989a, Baumg\u00e4rtner et al., 1982a, Baumg\u00e4rtner et al., 1982b; W.

Interestingly, this dog also showed immunolabelling of WNV antigen. It remains unclear, therefore, whether the detection of CPIV antigen represented a true infection, or whether immunoreactivity was due to a cross-reaction of the antibody with degraded cellular antigens, or to molecular mimicry (Oldstone, 1998).",

            "text": "A further surprising finding was the detection of EMCV antigen in the CNS of four dogs and four cats. EMCV-specific antibodies have been detected in primates, mice, rats, horses and elephants in various parts of the world, the rat being the natural host (Nowotny et al., 1993; Nowotny, 1996; Psalla et al., 2006). In Austria, a low seroprevalence has been reported in cats (Nowotny, 1996), but not dogs. In Germany, EMCV-associated non-suppurative meningoencephalitis is reported occasionally in man, but the virus has been isolated from the CNS in only a few cases (Nowotny et al., 1993; LaRue et al., 2003). The histopathological changes reported here varied (neuronal necrosis, mild lymphohistiocytic meningitis, severe generalized granulomatous or pyogranulomatous meningoencephalitis). In pigs with natural EMCV infections, lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the CNS have been described (Gainer et al., 1968). Experimentally infected mice and pigs also develop lymphohistiocytic, perivascular infiltrates in the CNS, poliomeningoencephalomyelitis being the predominant feature in mice (Topham et al., 1991; LaRue et al., 2003). In the present study, EMCV immunolabelling was observed in perikarya and processes of neurons in some animals, indicating neurotropism similar to that observed in experimental EMCV infection. The EMCV-positive cells, associated with cerebral vessels, may have been endothelial cells or pericytes. Neither cell type has been reported to be susceptible to EMCV, but endothelial and mesenchymal cells in organs other than the CNS are regularly infected with EMCV, as shown by Papaioannou et al. (2003) in pigs. The detection of EMCV antigen in macrophages in the CNS of dogs and cats may support their role in viral replication and distribution, as proposed by Papaioannou et al. (2003). In natural EMCV infection of pigs, interstitial myocarditis and myocardial degeneration represent the main features (Papaioannou et al., 2003). Neither change was observed in any of the present cases, but myocardial tissue was available from only one dog and two cats.",

Due to the retrospective character of the study, a standardized clinical and neurological investigation and serum and CSF laboratory procedures were not possible. In the remaining cases, infection cannot be ruled out. Other agents that might have caused the observed histopathological changes in dogs include Ehrlichia spp. (Glaus and Jaggy, 1992; Maretzki et al., 1994), Leptospira spp. (Rentko et al., 1992) and Borrelia spp. (Mandel et al., 1993; Chang et al., 2001), and in cats Bartonella henselae (Breitschwerdt et al., 1999) cannot be excluded. However, the high percentage of cases in which no infectious agent was identified suggests that non-infectious causes are more common than anticipated. Various factors, ranging from autoimmune processes to intoxication, have already been suggested as causes of non-suppurative changes in the CNS (Kipar et al., 1998; Uchida et al., 1999, Lee et al., 2002).",

In most of the cases showing these unexpected reactions the histopathological changes were severe and often resembled GME. Autoimmune mechanisms have already been discussed as a possible cause of canine GME and pug dog encephalitis (Kipar et al., 1998; Uchida et al., 1999). Other factors that may have played a role in the findings described include the following: epitope spreading (Bluestone and Miller, 1998; Vanderlugt et al., 1998); hereditary factors, as already suspected in pug dog encephalitis and non-suppurative meningoencephalitis in greyhounds (Hinrichs et al., 1996; Uchida et al., 1999; Callanan et al., 2002); intoxication (Lee et al., 2002); increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier in systemic illness, due to prostaglandins and interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, leading to infiltration of the CNS by inflammatory cells (Reiss et al., 2000). In addition, it should be mentioned that, unlike paraneoplastic encephalitis, which has been described in man but not in dogs or cats (Scaravilli et al., 1999), paraneoplastic polyneuropathy has been described in dogs (Braund, 1990; Wagner, 2002). As tumours in the CNS or other organs were present in only one of the cases examined, paraneoplastic encephalitis seemed unlikely to have played any role in the findings.",
