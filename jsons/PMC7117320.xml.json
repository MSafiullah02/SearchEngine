            "text": "Turkey coronavirus (TCoV, Order Nidovirales, Family Coronaviridae) is a group III coronavirus closely related to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens (Gomaa et al., 2008a). TCoV is an important infectious cause of diarrhoea in turkey poults that negatively impacts rate of growth and efficiency of feed utilization often associated with significant economic losses. Although TCoV was identified as the causative agent of \u2018Bluecomb disease\u2019 of turkey poults over 50 years ago (Tumlin et al., 1957), vaccines are not yet available to control the disease. In previous studies seroprevalence of TCoV was determined using virus neutralization (Pomeroy et al., 1975), fluorescent antibody tests (Patel et al., 1976) and ELISAs (Guy et al., 1997, Ali and Reynolds, 1998, Breslin et al., 2001). Some TCoV isolates can be propagated in turkey embryos (Pomeroy et al., 1975), but the virus cannot be propagated in cell culture (Guy et al., 1997, Ali and Reynolds, 1998, Breslin et al., 2001). This appeared to be one of the impediments for development of TCoV detection assays and more comprehensive prevalence studies, because there is not a convenient source of TCoV antigen. There is a high degree of conservation of the nucleocapsid protein among IBV isolates and between IBV and TCoV (Williams et al., 1992, Loa et al., 2000, Gomaa et al., 2008a) making assays based on this protein cross-reactive with other coronaviruses. Thus, even antigens other than TCoV have been used including IBV whole virus antigen in an antibody ELISA (Loa et al., 2000) IBV whole virus in standard ELISA (this study and others). Recombinant TCoV-N protein derived from a prokaryotic expression system has been used in antibody ELISAs (Loa et al., 2004, Gomaa et al., 2008b) and N-protein produced in a baculovirus expression system has been used in a competitive ELISA (Guy et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Four major structural proteins are produced by most coronaviruses: spike (S) glycoprotein, consisting of two subunits (S1, including a signal peptide domain), membrane (M) protein, small envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The most variable of these molecules is the spike glycoprotein (Gomaa et al., 2008a). For IBV, the S protein is approximately 180 kDa and undergoes post-translational modifications to yield two subunits, the N-terminal S1 subunit of 90 kDa and the C-terminal S2 subunit of 84 kDa (Cavanagh, 1983, Weiss and Martin, 2005). The S1 subunit carries the neutralizing epitopes and plays an important role in the attachment of the virus to the host cell membrane, induction of antibodies for virus neutralization and haemagglutination-inhibition, and induction of IBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Kant et al., 1992, Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994). Vaccination with S1 protein protected chickens against IBV challenge but vaccination with the M or N proteins did not (e.g., Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994, Song et al., 1998). Assuming that antibody responses to the S1 protein are similarly important for protection against TCoV, assays measuring antibodies against the spike glycoprotein, particularly S1, would be expected to be a better predictor of protective antibody responses to TCoV than assays based on IBV whole virus or recombinant TCoV nucleocapsid protein alone.",

Therefore, all RNA isolations and subsequent RT-PCR amplifications were conducted on a single filtrate obtained from the intestinal tissue of one turkey culled from this flock that was suffering from clinical disease consistent with TCoV. Briefly, intestinal tissue from this single infected bird was homogenized in 0.9% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then clarified by centrifugation at 4000 \u00d7 \ng for 15 min. The supernatant was filtered sequentially through 0.45 \u03bcm and 0.22 \u03bcm membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. The presence of TCoV in the filtrate was confirmed using negatively stained filtrate and transmission electron microscopy as well as RT-PCR of a portion of the nucleocapsid gene (Gomaa et al., 2009a). Extensive testing of the resulting TCoV-MG10 filtrate was done to exclude the possibility of the presence of any pathogens other than TCoV using electron microscopy as well as culture for bacteria, other viruses and mycoplasmas (Gomaa et al., 2009b).",

            "text": "Serological evidence for infection with TCoV has relied on one or more of the four major structural proteins produced by most coronaviruses: spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, small envelope (E) protein or nucleocapsid (N) protein. Most antibody ELISAs developed to identify serum antibodies against TCoV have relied on recombinant TCoV-N protein (e.g., Breslin et al., 2001, Guy et al., 2002, Loa et al., 2004, Gomaa et al., 2008b) or cross-reactivity to native IBV whole virus antigen (Loa et al., 2000). Unlike the N-protein, the spike glycoprotein, particularly the S1 subunit, varies considerably among strains of IBV (e.g., Gibertoni et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2007) and TCoV (Gomaa et al., 2008a). The S1 region carries the receptor binding domain that defines tissue and host tropisms and the S1 region is responsible for serotype variability among IBV isolates (Cavanagh, 1983, Cavanagh, 2005). Antibodies against the spike glycoprotein, particularly within hypervariable portions of the S1 region, have been shown to be responsible for virus neutralization and haemagglutination-inhibition of IBV (Kant et al., 1992, Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994). Presuming that the S1 region is equally important for a protective immune response against TCoV, measurement of antibodies specific for the S1 region of the spike protein might be expected to be a better predictor of flock protection against TCoV than assays dependent on antibodies cross-reacting against IBV whole virus antigen or specific for the more highly conserved TCoV nucleocapsid protein alone. Initially, we intended to clone and express the entire S1 protein of TCoV-MG10. However, as with IBV, the S1 protein of TCoV is characterized by presence of a signal peptide domain at the extreme 5\u2032 end of the gene (Gibertoni et al., 2005) that was found to block successful cloning and expression of the complete S1 gene (data not shown). To overcome this, a fragment of the S gene was selected for cloning and expression based on B cell epitope prediction.",

In contrast, using the IDEXX FlockChek\u00ae IBV whole virus ELISA performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and with the kit reagents (conjugated secondary antibody and enzyme substrate), only 16.7% of 168 field serum samples would be considered seropositive for TCoV; the two TCoV-specific ELISAs found that 70.24% (N-based) and 62.50% (TCoV-S54\u2013395-based) of these same serum samples were positive for antibodies recognizing TCoV. There were positive, albeit weak, correlations of the commercial IBV-based ELISA with the two recombinant TCoV ELISAs (Table 3). Interestingly, the IBV-based ELISA OD readings had higher correlation with the TCoV-N-based ELISA (r\n = 0.262) than they did to the TCoV-S54\u2013395-based ELISA (r\n = 0.190). Perhaps this is not surprising because the N-protein is relatively conserved and the S1 protein displays considerable heterogeneity among IBV and TCoV strains (e.g., McFarlane and Verma, 2008, McKinley et al., 2008) as well as between IBV and TCoV (Gomaa et al., 2008a). In contrast, there was strong positive correlation between the two recombinant ELISAs (r\n = 0.71; \u03c1\n = 0.879, Table 3). Assuming a typical turkey flock seroprevalence of TCoV of about 65% (Guy et al., 2002, Gomaa et al., 2008b), the TCoV-S54\u2013395-based ELISAs would typically have a positive predictive value of 96% and negative predictive value of 94%. Similar values have been shown for the N-based ELISA recently described (Gomaa et al., 2008b). It is likely that the TCoV-S54\u2013395-based ELISA would also be able to determine seroconversion of quail to a recently described enteric coronavirus (QCoV) because of its high amino acid identity in the S1 region with TCoV (Circella et al., 2007, Gomaa et al., 2008a).",

            "text": "Few epidemiological surveys have been conducted to determine TCoV seroprevalence. Using IFA or a commercially available (IDEXX) IBV-ELISA, it was determined that in Indiana, 175/325 (53.84%) or 163/325 (50.15%) field samples had antibodies for TCoV, respectively (Loa et al., 2000). In a second study using a competitive ELISA and a recombinant TCoV-N protein, 63% of sampled turkey poults were found to possess antibodies to TCoV (Guy et al., 2002). Our recombinant TCoV-S54\u2013395-based ELISA found 71.11% and 56.67% positive samples from Ontario breeder turkey and meat turkey flocks, respectively (Table 1, Table 2). The significantly higher prevalence in the turkey breeder flocks may result from the longer period over which these birds have had time to be exposed to TCoV and mount a detectable serum antibody response. The high seroprevalence of TCoV in commercial turkey flocks observed in this and previous studies (Loa et al., 2000, Guy et al., 2002) contrasts sharply with low prevalence of TCoV virus shedding observed in 33 commercial turkey flocks screened using an avian coronavirus RT-PCR technique (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008). This apparent discrepancy may indicate that TCoV may only shed for a relatively short period of time (Ismail et al., 2003; personal observations) and that subclinical infections with TCoV are much more common than was believed previously. Perhaps application of the recombinant TCoV ELISAs described in this paper and a previous report (Gomaa et al., 2008b) could be used to determine the onset of seroconversion in commercial flocks and associate this seroconversion with any changes in condition or performance of young poults.",
