For example, influenza viruses (FluA and FluB) comprised between 8.8% and 41.7% of all detections depending on year; hMPV, absent in 2016\u20122017, was the most commonly identified virus (37.7%) in 2018\u20122019.

            "text": "A number of limitations were encountered in this substudy. First, this assessment is part of a larger study evaluating the potential benefit of RIDT use in LTCF for early identification of influenza. The subsequent handling and transfer of nasal swabs was a secondary outcome, as RAPID-LTCF was not designed to be an epidemiologic assessment of respiratory viruses in such locations. Nevertheless, as the 10 study sites were randomly selected from a pool of 20 sites and had a wide geographic distribution, we do have a generalizable sampling frame. Second, we did not evaluate compliance of individual sites. In each of the first 2 years, personnel at 9 sites collected specimens; this dropped to 8 sites in the third year. The third year, however, was marked by a very late influenza season and manifested lower levels of respiratory virus activity across Wisconsin as evidenced by a 14% decline in ARI cases for patients \u226565 years of age recorded in electronic health record monitoring of Wisconsin surveillance clinics.1 Moreover, because of early autumn training and staff turnover, late season testing may be vulnerable to attrition in trained nursing staff. Third, other factors may have created interference with specimen transport. The WSLH changed couriers following the first year; the decline in the number of specimens that were transferred to WSLH for RT-PCR and RPP in the second 2 years was attributable, in part, to courier issues. Fourth, the RPP used in this study had a limited number of pathogens. Accordingly, the rate of virus identification may have been limited by the array of pathogens. The overall rate of virus detection, however, was similar to that found in our other surveillance systems using the same laboratory testing1 as well as in studies designed primarily to assess the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in LTCF settings.17\n,\n18 Fifth, we were unable to couple virus identification with clinical outcomes. Consequently, we do not know if there was selection bias in nurse identification of residents for testing. Finally, our study sites were distributed statewide, but were limited to less than 3% of Wisconsin's LTCFs.",

            "text": "Simple approaches to surveillance may provide a more comprehensive assessment of respiratory viruses in LTCF settings. The use of nasal swab specimens, obtained for on-site rapid influenza testing, was associated with a relatively high rate of respiratory virus identification by subsequent influenza RT-PCR and RPP. Detection of respiratory viruses was not significantly affected by resident age or time from symptom onset (up through 4 days). This approach demonstrated a wide variety of viruses and significant variability from year to year. Despite this variability, however, 4 viruses with high potential for morbidity and mortality in LTCF settings were found in nearly 70% of ARI cases. On-site testing of nasal swab specimens\u2014collected on-site from residents with ARI by nursing staff\u2014with additional virological testing off-site may not only provide a useful alternative for both respiratory virus diagnostic and surveillance efforts, but may ultimately provide useful information for infection control efforts and justification for prophylactic treatment of LTCF resident populations. This approach is consistent with and enhances existing guidelines that call for collection of specimens early in illness, appropriate testing as soon as possible, and reporting of results to public health and the originating facility.1\n",
