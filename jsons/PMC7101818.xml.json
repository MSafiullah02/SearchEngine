Clinical studies have confirmed the association between anemia and an increased risk of blood transfusion in surgical oncology.1,3,10,11 Anemia may also be associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, based on a meta-analysis of oncology studies that included patients who underwent surgery for cancer.12 Results from recent studies in patients undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer supported this conclusion by demonstrating that anemia is an independent prognostic factor for decreased locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival.13\u201318 Reviews of the available evidence have demonstrated a strong relationship between anemia and decreased quality of life in patients with cancer,19,20 but clinical studies of this association typically have focused on chemotherapy-associated anemia, not anemia in patients with cancer who underwent surgery. Additional study would be needed to determine whether the association between anemia and postoperative morbidity, mortality, and quality of life exists in patients who are undergoing cancer-related surgery.",

Withholding blood transfusions perioperatively in asymptomatic patients without cardiac disease with low-normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels, or even mild-to-moderate anemia, may be well tolerated. A randomized, controlled study of lung resection for non-small-cell lung carcinoma reported no improvement in morbidity and mortality when patients were transfused to maintain Hb > 10 g/dL compared with patients transfused to maintain Hb between 8.5 and 10 g/dL (Table 1).21 These findings are consistent with similar randomized, controlled studies of critically ill anemic patients,22 or patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture23 or major vascular reconstruction,24 in which more restrictive transfusion strategies did not worsen outcomes. The lowest \u201csafe\u201d Hb before blood transfusion remains an area of active research and lively debate.\n\n",

This range may reflect changes in blood storage; the greatest risk was reported in the 1980s, when red blood cells were suspended in substantially more plasma, whereas the lower-risk estimates were obtained in 2000\u20132001 with the standardized use of additive storage solutions for red blood cells.30 The mechanism of TRALI is not completely understood, but it appears to involve localization of antibody-coated leukocytes to pulmonary vasculature resulting in increased permeability and edema.59 Presenting signs and symptoms of TRALI include dyspnea, hypotension, fever, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates without evidence of cardiac compromise or fluid overload. Symptoms begin during or shortly after transfusion, and TRALI develops fully within 1\u20136 hours. TRALI is fatal in 5\u201310% of cases,54 and it may be responsible for more serious adverse events and fatalities than are reported because it is often misdiagnosed.60 When TRALI occurs, oxygen therapy should be initiated immediately, the transfusion should be stopped, and the remaining blood product should be returned to the blood center for testing. Prompt identification and treatment of TRALI is important to minimize the risk of fatality and optimize long-term prognosis.56,57\n",

For ethical and logistic reasons, surgical oncology patients cannot be assigned to a \u201cno-transfusion\u201d group. Therefore, PAD or allogeneic transfusion alone are commonly used as control groups in clinical trials.74\u201376 Busch et al. concluded that PAD before surgery for colorectal cancer reduced the use of allogeneic blood transfusion, but did not improve recurrence rates and disease-free survival.74,75 However, the use of blood transfusion\u2014either allogeneic or autologous\u2014was associated with increased cancer recurrence. Heiss et al. also found no significant difference in disease-free survival after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer who donated blood preoperatively compared with patients who did not.76 In a multivariate analysis, the investigators reported that allogeneic blood transfusion was associated with a greater than 6-fold increase in the relative risk of tumor recurrence in both treatment groups. Another controlled study by van de Watering et al. determined that patients with colorectal cancer had comparable survival and recurrence rates if they were transfused with leukocyte-depleted allogeneic blood or with packed red blood cells with leukocytes.77\n",

The blood is stored during surgery and returned to the patient when needed, either for a major bleeding episode during surgery or when surgery is complete. ANH is thought to reduce red cell loss during surgery because fewer red cells are lost in diluted blood. Other advantages include its low cost, patient convenience, and the low risk of administrative error because the blood remains with the patient.",

            "text": "Collection and reinfusion of autologous red blood cells (perioperative blood salvage) may reduce the need for allogeneic transfusion. The process is generally considered to be safe, but several clinical issues remain. Shed blood contains higher concentrations of inflammatory mediators\u2014such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1\u2014than circulating blood.95,96 Tumor cells also may be present in shed blood, so blood salvage historically was considered to be contraindicated during certain oncology surgeries.97 More recently, clinical studies have demonstrated that filtration or irradiation of shed blood may remove tumor cells. A pilot study of leukocyte filtration in 16 lung cancer patients who were treated with perioperative blood salvage reported that tumor cells were present in salvaged blood of 9 of 16 patients before filtration, but in none of the blood after filtration.98 Another study evaluated 62 patients who were treated with cell salvage and leukocyte filtration during prostatectomy, compared with a historical group of 101 patients who underwent PAD.99 The cell-salvage group had higher hematocrit values and required fewer allogeneic blood transfusions perioperatively, yet rates of progression-free survival were comparable between groups. Another study evaluated 20 consecutive patients who underwent either pancreaticoduodenectomy or major hepatectomy for the presence of malignant cells from autotransfusion filtered blood following resection.100 This prospective study evaluated all intraoperative blood loss that was designated for waste from opening to closure and was collected, filtered, and prepared for autotransfusion. The preparation was then evaluated by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical methods to see if any malignant cells could be autotransfused back into the patient. Flow cytometry did not demonstrate the presence of any cytokeratin-positive carcinoma cells in filtered blood, and the authors concluded that intraoperative autotransfusion for major hepatectomy in metastatic colorectal cancer and pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma is safe. Finally, a group of researchers reported that in more than 700 surgical oncology patients, they were able to eradicate tumor cells in salvaged blood via high-dose irradiation of the blood prior to reinfusion.101 Therefore, leukocyte filtration or irradiation of salvaged blood may mitigate concerns about the potential for reinfusion of tumor cells.",

            "text": "Although the prevalence of anemia in surgical oncology may vary widely, acute blood loss during oncologic surgery often is compounded by the existence of several cancer-related factors such as anemia of chronic disease, poor nutrition, or chemotherapy. Several studies have reported that anemia worsens morbidity and mortality in surgical oncology patients, and the use of blood transfusion may exacerbate\u2014not ameliorate\u2014these sequelae. Blood-conservation strategies such as PAD, ANH, perioperative blood salvage, and minimally invasive surgical techniques can reduce dependence on blood transfusion, and epoetin alfa can be used in the treatment of anemic patients who are scheduled to undergo elective, noncardiac, nonvascular surgery. Randomized clinical trials have reported these strategies do not worsen clinical outcomes relative to allogeneic blood transfusion. However, there is no conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of a particular blood-conservation strategy in cancer patients who undergo surgery, and the optimal blood management strategy remains to be defined by additional clinical studies. Until that evidence becomes available, the clinical utility of blood conservation should be assessed for each patient individually as a component of preoperative planning in surgical oncology.",
