Patients and their families see compassion as essential in acute care settings,3 and compassion has been associated with lower rates of burnout among clinicians.8 Understanding the contextual landscape of compassion in healthcare and how clinicians adapt expressions of compassion according to context may advance compassion as a deliberate and mindful practice.",

Our study identified limits to compassion and the unintended suffering that may occur within actions intended to express compassion. While clinicians do not intend to cause suffering, compassion unfolds through interactions between people with different worldviews and priorities; what is experienced may not be as intended. Through witnessing suffering, feeling powerless to relieve suffering, and at times unintentionally contributing to suffering, clinicians may suffer themselves.18,19 And from a systems perspective where resources are finite, spending more time with one patient may limit time spent with another. We are not advocating that compassion be avoided, but rather draw attention to these unintended consequences so that they can be anticipated and their effect mitigated. For example, resilience training, contemplative practices, and peer support may prevent or reduce the impact of vicarious trauma and burnout.20",

Awareness of what makes compassion difficult could help clinicians proactively identify when they do not have the capacity for compassion and ask a colleague to devote more attention towards compassion. Similarly, when teams notice constraining factors, they can be more intentional in enacting compassion, more vigilant for gaps in compassion, and more prepared to fill in gaps. These concepts of teamwork have previously been described within the general teamwork literature as mutual performance monitoring, backup behavior, and adaptability,21 and have been applied to managing emergency medical situations.22 The patient safety literature also considers the collective competence of a team in addition to individual performance.23 To our knowledge, how these concepts of teamwork could apply to the relational dimensions of medicine has not previously been considered.",
