            "text": "Background: Electronic cigarettes/e-cigarettes (ECs), or vaping, is currently the most popular form of smoking amongst youth in the United States. ECs are battery-powered devices that vaporize a liquid that comes in small cartridges, or pods, that contain various chemicals, nicotine, and an array of flavors that can be modified to include cannabinoids (THC). With increasing popularity, however, there is an epidemic of pulmonary and gastrointestinal illnesses associated with vaping in the continental U.S.A. Methods: We analyzed medical charts of three patients who were active users of ECs and presented with pneumonitis to our community medical center between January and August 2019. Results: We report three cases of vaping pneumonitis in young adults, ages 18 to 21, who presented with similar symptoms, profiles, imaging studies, and disease progression. The average length of stay was approximately one week, and all patients had an extensive work-up in addition to a relapsing and remitting course of their condition. Conclusions: Early recognition and diagnosis of vaping pneumonitis are essential in the treatment of the ongoing epidemic. Extensive unnecessary work up may lead to increased healthcare costs. Our case series echoes the concerns of the CDC such that ECs should be avoided, and those with any pulmonary or gastrointestinal symptoms should seek medical attention promptly.",

            "text": "The prevalence of ECs, or vaping, is increasing worldwide. Data shows increased use of e-cigarettes between 2011 to 2018 of 1.5 to 20.8% among high school students, an estimated increase from approximately 220,000 to 3.05 million high school students. Between 2017 and 2018, e-cigarette use was found to have increased 78% [1] . ECs are marketed as the \"safe alternative\" to smoking due to the belief that vaping could be a \"harm reduction\" alternative to smoking to the same degree as other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved nicotine replacement therapies [2] . Vaping companies promote consumer attestations that ECs helped them quit smoking and improved their overall health [3] . These proclamations are controversial as there is sparse literature to show that EC users were more likely to quit smoking than regular cigarette users [4, 5] . There is a concern that ECs could increase worldwide nicotine dependence, especially among young adults who are enticed by the many flavors ECs offer [6] . The medical community is apprehensive of vaping and advises caution since limited scientific evidence is available to show their efficacy and safety [6] . We present three cases of pneumonitis seen at our small community hospital that further supports the harmful effects of ECs.",

Both diseases cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. They can each progress to necessitating ICU admissions. However, a main difference between the two conditions revolves around the research that has been conducted to this point. The main mechanism of acute eosinophilic pneumonia has been elucidated to be due to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, and tumor necrosis factor. This combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines is thought to be the inciting event in this disease process, which leads to the eosinophil-rich exudate within the alveoli [7, 8] . The main mechanism of action of vaping induced pneumonitis, however, has not been elucidated to this point. Further research may focus on elucidating this mechanism so as to create better treatments for this condition.",
