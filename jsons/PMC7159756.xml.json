Regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between neutrophil granulocyte count in sputum with l\u2010lactate and d\u2010lactate.

In the human neutrophil metabolism, lactate is produced in glycolysis by the cleavage from LDH 16. In disease states such as acute lung injuries, the net production of pulmonary lactate increases and correlates with the severity of the lung injury 17, 18. This lactate production is thought to be due to augmented cytokine effects on pulmonary and inflammatory cells 18, 19. In addition, viral infection of human cells may induce the Warburg effect 20, 21, 22 leading to production of l\u2010lactate 23.",

In mammals, the amount of l\u2010LDH exceeds the amount of d\u2010LDH by far, and therefore l\u2010lactate is the primary isoform of lactate in humans 8. The metabolic activity in bacteria halts immediately during the early phase of antibiotic treatment, and d\u2010lactate has shown to be a potentially useful biomarker for successful therapy 9. Measuring d\u2010lactate during antibiotic treatment in various body compartments has been promising as an indicator of decrease in bacterial load 2. In our study, d\u2010lactate was detected in sputum, but we could not demonstrate an association between the sputum neutrophil count and sputum d\u2010lactate, indicating that d\u2010lactate does not originate from neutrophils. Instead, as we have assumed in this study, bacteria may be the source of d\u2010lactate. However, this assumption is challenged by the lack of association between bacteria and d\u2010lactate in our study. We speculate that the antibiotic treatment may have confounded the distribution of d\u2010lactate in the sputum samples by reducing the bacterial production of d\u2010lactate.",

We could not prioritize research samples over clinical samples, as this could impair detection rates, but unfortunately almost a fifth of samples for microbiology were contaminated or lost, which reduced the number of specimens detected. Sampling should preferably have been done before initiation of antibiotic treatment, as culture of common pathogens in LRTI (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae) is difficult after initiation. Thus, it is likely that some of the cultured samples from infected participants contained non\u2010viable bacteria that could not be identified in the clinical laboratory and which potentially could have been found if a different PCR had been used. Further, culture on expectorated samples treated with antibiotics (e.g. penicillin) may cause opportunistic growth of mainly gram\u2010negative bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli), which are rarely a LRTI pathogen, but this was not seen.",

Both sputum l\u2010lactate and d\u2010lactate were associated with viral LRTI but not bacterial, suggesting a greater inflammatory response in viral or mixed viral/bacterial than bacterial LRTI.
