While typically presenting in early to middle adulthood, advances in diagnostic tools has meant that patients are now being identified at an earlier stage [2], with a growing proportion of MS cases being diagnosed in childhood or adolescence [3]. Recent figures suggest that, overall, the number of people living with MS is increasing internationally [1, 4].",

While a variety of symptoms may be experienced by patients [5], the development and availability of a wide range of treatments has meant that people with MS (PwMS) are now better placed to manage their condition [1]. Nevertheless, although many PwMS continue to live independently and maintain a high quality of life (QOL), others require ongoing care and support. Often, family members and friends are required to deliver this support, taking on the role of \u201cinformal caregivers\u201d [6, 7]. Their role in providing care is critical in helping to meet the gaps left by deficits in formal healthcare supports, yet the challenges of providing care to PwMS are frequently overlooked [8].",

While quantifying and conceptualising burden can be difficult, owing to various definitions and measures in existence, the consensus is that this can have a detrimental impact on caregiver QOL and well-being [10, 11, 12\u2022\u2022]. For example, a recent report found that caring for PwMS can negatively influence caregiver physical and mental health, as well as impacting on their financial situation and employment status [13]. Other work, however, suggests that caregiving involves more than simply the experience of burden, stress and/or strain and may indeed lead to positive consequences [14\u2022, 15].",

We discuss how contemporary research points to ways in which caregivers can be better supported in their roles, decreasing the risk of burden and, consequently, enhancing well-being for both themselves and their care recipients.",

This in itself is a difficult feat, as PwMS can vary greatly in their care needs, with fluctuations in need occurring over the time course of the disease and with disease type. Few countries collect statistics on the number of MS caregivers [16]; however, one recent large-scale analysis with almost 17,000 PwMS suggested that 46% received informal care from family members [17\u2022\u2022]. While this figure is broadly consistent with other estimates [18], some studies report that as many as 58% of PwMS receive informal care [7], with requirements for care increasing considerably with increasing levels of disability. Given an estimate of over 2.2 million cases of MS worldwide [19], we can therefore extrapolate that there are more than one million MS caregivers globally.",

As there are a disproportionately higher number of women diagnosed with MS (a ratio of 2.8:1 [21]), one might expect a higher proportion of male MS caregivers overall. The gender breakdown of MS caregivers, however, varies considerably across contexts. While some studies, as expected, report a higher proportion of male carers [22\u2022\u2022, 23], others suggest females are more likely to take on the caregiving role [20, 24\u201326]. In one study based in Mexico, female MS caregivers reported spending nearly twice as much time caring as male caregivers (79 vs. 48 h per week), having also been in their caring role for nearly three times as long [26]. These variations may be linked to gender role expectations and are reflective of the wider caring literature, which indicates that women take on the majority of caring responsibilities [14\u2022]. Given shifts towards fuller female participation in the workforce, coupled with blurring gender roles, one might expect the proportion of MS male caregivers to increase over the coming years, though this is likely to be dependent on cultural norms.",

The experience of physical co-morbidities can make caring more difficult [28], meaning that this group is particularly vulnerable to health-related burdens from care. In contrast, there are also many young caregivers who take on the role of supporting parents with MS [29\u201331], as well as parental caregivers of those with paediatric MS [32\u201334]. These diverse groups may experience a different set of challenges and needs, which is often reflective of their stage of life [35].

For example, MS caregivers may be required to assist with basic activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL, as well as providing social-practical and psycho-emotional care for their care recipients [41]. All of these responsibilities require considerable time commitments, with MS caregivers spending an average of 6.5 h a day dedicated to caring tasks [6]. Although this may not be as high as reported by caregivers of some other neurological conditions [9], such responsibilities clearly have implications for other domains of life, such as employment. As evidence of this, 40% of MS carers reported missing work in the past year due to caring responsibilities [22\u2022\u2022], with 24% either reducing or stopping work completely [18]. This may be even more difficult for parental carers of children or adolescents with MS, who may not only have to take time off work but are also required to juggle other responsibilities, such as care of other children [42, 43].",

Nevertheless, this cost does not always lead to decrements in caregiver well-being [6]. Subjective burden, in contrast, which refers to the caregiver\u2019s own perception of the impact that caring has on their daily life, appears more strongly related to well-being [6]. While more time spent caring is associated with greater likelihood of experiencing subjective burden [45], a high objective burden from caring for PwMS is not always associated with negative perceptions [41]. This fits with recent findings from the broader literature on caregiving. For example, our recent work with a representative sample of European carers found that the majority reported being happy with the amount of time they spent caring [14\u2022].",

The use of standardised measures, however, can be useful when attempting to compare the burden experienced by MS carers to those caring for other chronic illness groups.

Recent models have attempted to explain caregiver burnout by adopting a similar approach, acknowledging the role of the caregiver, caregiving setting and sociocultural context [55].

While care needs for PwMS typically become greater over time, the wide variability in MS progression means that time since diagnosis, in itself, is not a reliable predictor of burden. Rather, burden appears to be associated with the extent of disease progression. A consistent finding is that higher caregiver stress and burden are associated with higher levels of disability, such as increasing scores on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) [6, 7] or problems walking [45, 56\u201358]. Unsurprisingly, carer burden is also higher for those caring for people with progressive forms of the disease (both primary and secondary progressive MS), in comparison to those with relapsing remitting MS [22\u2022\u2022].",

Aside from known associations between burden and mobility/disability, recent studies have explored how cognitive problems in PwMS relate to caregiver stress and strain. This work reflects more broadly a greater acknowledgement of the prevalence of cognitive problems in MS [46]. Caregiver burden has been shown to be predicted by higher dysexecutive function [6] and cognitive/neuropsychiatric problems [57], while a comprehensive analysis of cognitive functioning in PwMS found that lower working memory capacity, information processing speed, executive functioning and verbal fluency were all associated with worse caregiver health-related QOL [59, 60]. Notably, cognitive problems predicted caregiver depressive symptoms, independently of other MS-related symptoms [59]. Developing supports for helping both PwMS and their caregivers deal with the cognitive consequences of MS may therefore be particularly beneficial in reducing burden.",

Recent qualitative work supports the idea of gender differences in the MS caregiving experience. For example, male caregivers are more likely to experience physical concerns from caregiving [22\u2022\u2022], as well as problems with social expectations, such as those relating to marital relationships and gender roles [63]. They also experience more fears for the future, which, as later discussed, is an important factor to consider when supporting those affected by MS. Females, in contrast, express more need for emotional support [12\u2022\u2022] and do also report having greater social support [62].

Working to alleviate psychological distress in caregivers may therefore offer a means of reducing burden. This may include, for example, exploring ways to help both PwMS and caregivers cope with the uncertainty that comes hand-in-hand with the disease. More broadly, it may prove valuable to consider the role of psychological appraisals and illness perceptions in explaining how carers respond to the care situation when informing the provision of supports [14\u2022, 55]. This may include mechanisms for fostering resilience, optimism and self-efficacy. Psychosocial interventions, such as programmes involving psycho-education, may offer an effective pathway for achieving this [71]. Indeed, simple measures, such as providing MS caregivers with appropriate information, may be a cost-effective way of reducing worries and perceived burden.",

As stated previously, greater time spent caring (i.e. objective burden) is associated with greater subjective burden [25, 45]. Identifying ways of assisting carers with their tasks, including through the provision of respite care, would clearly alleviate burden. Furthermore, an analysis of data drawn from a cross-section of European countries suggests that a key factor in helping reduce the need for informal care is through the provision of community support [17\u2022\u2022]. A need for social support is regularly expressed by MS caregivers, with many expressing a need to talk to somebody outside of their family and hospital staff [70]. Greater social support is associated with less experience of MS carer burnout [72], while a lack of support predicts carer depression, even after controlling for patient health status and disease severity [58]. This finding has been recently replicated in a variety of other carer populations [73].",

Firstly, future work should aim to appreciate the complexity of the MS caring experience, as well as the dyadic process of adjustment to living with the disease, which often results in shifting roles for both the carer and PwMS. Secondly, given the evidence that carers vary widely in age, background and relationship to the PwMS, viewing MS caregivers as a single homogenous group should be avoided. Providing supports for parental caregivers of paediatric MS, for example, may require a different approach than supports targeted at carers of adult PwMS [16]. Any proposed caregiver supports should be tailored in light of the various individual, care-recipient and contextual factors that are known to influence the caregiving experience. In particular, the psychosocial dimension of caring should receive more prominent acknowledgement.
