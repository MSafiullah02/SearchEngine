            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS, myelin degradation and oligodendrocyte loss. It is the most common neurological disease affecting young adults (Ewing and Bernard, 1998). The etiology and pathogenesis of MS have yet to be elucidated but are probably multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors (Ewing and Bernard, 1998). Several viruses have been associated with demyelinating processes (Sarchielli et al., 1993) and the human coronaviruses (HCoV) represent candidate environmental triggers of MS pathogenesis. The murine counterpart of HCoV, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), can induce an MS-like disease in genetically susceptible animals (Lane and Buchmeier, 1997) and HCoV are both neurotropic and neuroinvasive (Arbour et al., 1999a, Arbour et al., 1999b, Arbour et al., 2000). We have previously characterized acute and persistent infections of human neural cell lines by both known viral serogroups, OC43 and 229E (Lachance et al., 1998, Arbour et al., 1999a, Arbour et al., 1999b). Importantly, HCoV-OC43 RNA was detected in human brains (Murray et al., 1992, Stewart et al., 1992, Arbour et al., 2000). Interestingly, primary cultures of human astrocytes and microglia are susceptible to HCoV infection (Bonavia et al., 1997). Thus, this virus may be involved in demyelinating diseases by a mechanism of virus-induced myelin damage following infection of astrocytes and/or microglia.",

Given our in vitro observations of glial cell infection by HCoV, we hypothesize that HCoV may participate in MS pathogenesis through an indirect mechanism whereby glial cell infection in genetically susceptible individuals may lead to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory molecules that could participate in the destruction of the oligodendrocyte-myelin unit observed in MS.",

Moreover, a wide range of cytokines and chemokines have been detected in MS lesions. More specifically, IL-1\u03b1 and \u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1\u03b1, and MCP-1, have pro-inflammatory properties that could participate in CNS demyelination (Benveniste, 1997, Munoz-Fernandez and Fresno, 1998). Activated glial cells are known to secrete matrix metalloproteinases. Of these, MMPs-2, -3, -7 and -9 were shown to be able to cleave myelin basic protein (MBP) within the encephalitogenic portion of the protein; this would be expected to contribute to immune responses against MBP epitopes and demyelination (Chandler et al., 1995, Chandler et al., 1997, Cossins et al., 1997). Astrocytes and microglia can produce NO, a non-specific inflammatory mediator of oligodendrocyte death. Furthermore, active NO synthase was detected in astrocytes present at the level of MS plaques, at the lesion edge where demyelination occurs (Mitrovic et al., 1996).",

Two major bands of gelatinolysis at 66 and 92 kDa were detected (Fig. 2\n) that were, respectively, identified as MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 gelatinases, on the basis of their molecular mass and inhibition of activity by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. In some instances, a third band of 82 kDa was observed which corresponds to active MMP-9 cleaved from its latent form, pro-MMP-9/92 kDa. While MMP-2 was constitutively expressed in both glial cell lines, its activity was increased at 24 h post-infection when compared to untreated cells. Both cell lines also expressed MMP-9. Untreated U-373MG astrocytic cells secreted very low levels of pro-MMP-9 which were significantly increased at 24 h post-infection, and a faint digestion site, corresponding to active MMP-9, was detected at 48 h post-infection (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the CHME-5 microglial cells showed MMP-9 secretion and an active form of the enzyme at 48 h (Fig. 2B). In order to determine whether increased MMP secretion was a direct consequence of viral infection or was due to soluble factors released upon viral infection, culture supernatants from infected cells were used to treat non-infected cells. While the supernatants were non-infectious, the kinetics of gelatinase activity was similar to that observed upon HCoV-OC43 infection (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that MMP secretion is mediated by soluble factors produced by infected cells.",

Moreover, detection of gelatinase activity by zymography suggested a modulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in infected astrocytes and microglia that was mediated by soluble molecules. Finally, nitrite quantification suggested that viral infection of both cell types led to the release of NO, presumably through iNOS activation. Thus, our data clearly show that the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (cytokines, chemokines, MMPs, and NO) that have been associated with CNS pathologies is increased in glial cells following infection by the OC43 strain of human coronavirus.",

The upregulation of IL-6 mRNA expression observed following HCoV infection was described after Theiler\u2019s virus infection of astrocytes (Benveniste, 1998). The precise role of IL-6 in CNS pathologies remains unclear since it appears to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties through the promotion of leukocyte recruitment by induction of chemokine and adhesion molecules or the downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 expression and the upregulation of soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptor and IL-1R antagonist expression (Benveniste, 1998). Given that IL-6 induction following HCoV infection did not abrogate TNF-\u03b1 induction in our study, this argues that IL-6 does not repress TNF-\u03b1 induction in astrocytes. In addition, IL-6 was shown to modulate the expression of MMP and TIMP (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase; Giraudon et al., 1997).",

We observed enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion in infected cells. Since MMP-2 can cleave and activate MMP-9, the increased MMP-9 activity might be attributed in part to increased MMP-2 expression (Fridman et al., 1995). Increased activity of MMP-2 was reported in other viral infections, such as upon exposure to HIV-1 gp41 peptides (Chong et al., 1998).

It would therefore be of interest to evaluate the effect of these cytokines on MMP secretion and activity in glial cells. It is clear that cytokines and possibly viral proteins can regulate the synthesis, secretion and activity of MMPs. The combined effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines and MMP secretion on the health of the oligodendrocyte\u2013myelin unit and their precise role in MS pathogenesis remain to be investigated. It is known, however, that MMPs can participate in autoimmunity by cleavage of myelin components and degradation of the extracellular matrix, thereby altering cell\u2013cell connectivity.

Thus, the increased NO production we observed might be attributed to TNF-\u03b1 induction following infection. The observed pattern of NO production suggests that it is mediated by the transcription of the iNOS gene, since it is known to be tightly regulated and to generate greater amounts of NO (Liu et al., 1994).

This argues for an indirect inflammatory mechanism by which HCoV-OC43 could be implicated in an inflammatory pathology of the CNS, such as MS. We have shown that HCoV-OC43 can influence the expression of cytokines, chemokine and MMP and lead to an increased production of NO. These inflammatory mediators could act in concert to orchestrate an inflammatory pathology in the CNS.",
