The identification of papules in well-haired skin was difficult, and clipping of the fur facilitated their detection.

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common, systemic and almost always fatal disease. Cats are initially infected with an avirulent feline coronavirus that replicates in enterocytes. In some instances, a mutation occurs, resulting in the ability of the virus to replicate within macrophages, and mutated viruses are disseminated from the intestine by macrophages throughout the body. Clinical signs result from the cat's own immune reaction. FIP is an immune complex disease involving virus, antiviral antibodies and complement. 1 The development of vasculitis and granulomas was previously attributed to a type-III hypersensitivity reaction. A recent study indicated that in FIP, inflammatory processes are restricted to veins and that phlebitis is initiated by activated and feline coronavirus-infected, circulating monocytes. 2 FIP exists in three clinical forms: an effusive (wet) form, a noneffusive (dry) form and a mixed form. 1, 3 The effusive form is characterized by fibrinous to granulomatous serositis, with accumulation of protein-rich fluid within body cavities. The noneffusive form is characterized by granulomatous inflammatory lesions in several organs (including abdominal viscera, eyes, lungs and central nervous system). Definitively diagnosing FIP antemortem can be extremely challenging. Difficulties arise from nonspecific clinical signs; lack of pathognomonic, haematologic, and biochemical abnormalities; and low sensitivity and specificity of tests routinely used in practice. More recent diagnostic tests including immunohistochemical staining of antigen in macrophages in effusion or tissue that is 100% specific for the diagnosis of FIP. 1 Dermatological abnormalities in association with spontaneous FIP are rare. Entire male cats may show scrotal swelling. 4 Skin lesions associated with debility have been reported. Subcutaneous oedema was observed in three cats, 5 and skin fragility was seen in a cat with FIP and hepatic lipidosis. 6 Only two reports have described primary cutaneous lesions: truncal papules to nodules characterized by pyogranulomatous vasculitis and mural folliculitis were described in a 1-year-old Sphinx cat; 7 and small nodules over the neck and proximal forelimbs characterized by pyogranulomatous dermal phlebitis and periphlebitis in a 1-year-old domestic cat with concurrent feline immunodeficiency virus infection. 8 Immunohistochemistry demonstrated coronavirus antigen within lesional macrophages in both cases. The purpose of this paper is to describe the morphologic characteristics and histopathological aspects of primary skin lesions in a cat with a mixed form of FIP.",

At physical examination, the cat was thin with a rectal temperature of 40 \u00b0 C. Anterior uveitis was present in the right eye with protrusion of the third eyelid, conjunctival hyperaemia, episcleral congestion, miosis, swelling and hyperaemia of the iris and reduction in ocular pressure assessed by tonometry. The clinical suspicion was FIP. Tachypnoea was noted when the cat was handled for blood sampling, which restricted analysis to total protein, serum protein electrophoresis and infectious disease serologic tests. The level of total protein was within reference range (75 g L \u2212 1 reference range 55-85 g L \u2212 1 ), albumin was marginally low (26.7 g L \u2212 1 reference range 29 -41 g L \u2212 1 ), globulin was mildly elevated (48.2 g L \u2212 1 reference range 26 -44 g L \u2212 1 ) and the albumin: globulin ratio was 0.55. The cat was feline immunodeficiency virus antibody and feline leukaemia virus antigen negative. Serum antibody titres for Toxoplasma gondii were also negative. The cat was treated with topical dexamethasone 0.1%, topical tropicamide 0.5%, oral administration of clindamycin at 22 mg kg \u2212 1 and ketoprofen at 1 mg kg \u2212 1 .",

Further clipping of the coat revealed multiple papules (more than 40) over the dorsal neck (Fig. 2) , and right and left lateral thoracic walls. Lesions were nonpainful, firm, well-circumscribed intradermal, slightly raised and erythematous, measuring from 2 to 9 mm in diameter.

These signs along with the mild changes in serum protein levels and the exclusion of other potential causes were suggestive of FIP. Serology testing for feline corona virus antibody was not performed because results are often of limited value for clinical diagnosis. 9 A positive titre does not provide support for this diagnosis as many cats without disease have positive titres. A negative titre in a sick cat does not rule out FIP because some cats with fulminant FIP may present with negative titres resulting from anergy or antigen-antibody complement formation that limits the ability to detect virus-specific antibodies. 9 As the disease progressed, more suggestive clinical signs such as renal involvement and pleural effusion became apparent. At this clinical stage, Rivalta's test could have been performed on pleural fluid and, if positive, antigen could have been detected in macrophages by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry. Detection of intracellular feline coronavirus antigen is the only way to definitively diagnose FIP. 1 In the present report a definitive diagnosis was made by histopathology and immunohistochemistry on lesional tissue of kidney and skin. Clinical findings at the time of euthanasia and postmortem included uveitis, pleural and mild abdominal effusion and granulomas in both kidneys and in the skin.

Resumen Un gato dom\u00e9stico no castrado de siete a\u00f1os de edad se present\u00f3 con fiebre, uveitis anterior en el ojo derecho y distres respiratorio cuando era manipulado. Estos signos junto con cambios leves en las proteinas del suero y la exclusi\u00f3n de otras causas potenciales eran indicativos de peritonitis infecciosa felina (PIF). Seg\u00fan la enfermedad progresaba se observaron m\u00e1s signos cl\u00ednicos caracter\u00edsticos de PIF, incluyendo lesiones renales y m\u00e1s adelante una efusi\u00f3n pleural se hizo evidente. Se observaron en estad\u00edos finales de la enfermedad unas lesiones cut\u00e1neas no prur\u00edticas que consist\u00edan en p\u00e1pulas intradermicas ligeramente elevadas sobre el dorso del cuello y en las paredes laterales del t\u00f3rax. La identificaci\u00f3n de papulas en zonas con denso pelo era dif\u00edcil y el rasurado del pelo facilit\u00f3 su detecci\u00f3n. El diagn\u00f3stico definitivo de PIF se realiz\u00f3 mediante t\u00e9cnica de inmunohistoqu\u00edmica demostrando el ant\u00edgeno de coronavirs en macr\u00f3fagos en el ri\u00f1\u00f3n y las lesiones de la piel. El caso fue clasificado como una forma mixta de PIF. El reconocimiento de las lesiones cut\u00e1neas podria facilitar el diagn\u00f3stico de PIF en casos sospechosos. Zusammenfassung Eine 7 Monate alte, unkastrierte m\u00e4nnliche kurzhaarige Hauskatze wurde mit Fieber, Uveitis anterior im rechten Auge und Atemnot bei Handling vorgestellt. Diese Anzeichen, gemeinsam mit geringen Ver\u00e4nderungen der Serumproteinwerte und der Ausschluss anderer potentieller Ursachen wiesen auf feline infekti\u00f6se Peritonitis (FIP) hin. Als die Krankheit weiter fortschritt, wurden weitere klinische Anzeichen, die mit FIP vereinbar waren, einschlie\u00dflich einer Beteiligung der Nieren und sp\u00e4ter ein Pleuralerguss, offensichtlich. Nicht-juckende Hautver\u00e4nderungen, die durch leicht erh\u00f6hte intradermale Papeln \u00fcber dem dorsalen Hals und \u00fcber der Thoraxwand beidseits charakterisiert waren, wurden im Endstadium der Krankheit gesehen. Die Identifizierung der Papeln in der gutbehaarten Haut war schwierig und das Rasieren des Fells erleichterte ihre Erkennung. Eine definitive Diagnose f\u00fcr FIP wurde histopathologisch gestellt, sowie mittels immunhistochemischer Demonstration des Coronavirus Antigens in den Makrophagen innerhalb der Nieren-und Hautver\u00e4nderungen. Der Fall wurde als eine gemischte Form der FIP eingestuft. Die Erkennung von dazugeh\u00f6rigen Hautl\u00e4sionen kann eine Diagnose von FIP in Verdachtsf\u00e4llen erleichtern.",

Peroxidase antiperoxidase method; bar = 100 \u00b5m.R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Un chat Europ\u00e9en m\u00e2le non castr\u00e9 ag\u00e9 de 7 mois a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 avec de la fi\u00e8vre, une uv\u00e9ite ant\u00e9rieure de l'oeil droit et une d\u00e9tresse respiratoire. Ces signes associ\u00e9s \u00e0 des modifications mod\u00e9r\u00e9es du taux de prot\u00e9ines et \u00e0 l'exclusion des autres diagnostics diff\u00e9rentiels \u00e9taient suggestifs d'une p\u00e9ritonite infectieuse f\u00e9line (FIP). La maladie a progress\u00e9 et d'autres signes cliniques compatibles avec une FIP sont apparus, notamment un \u00e9panchement pleural et une atteinte r\u00e9nale. Des l\u00e9sions cutan\u00e9es non prurigineuses, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es par des papules intradermiques mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment en relief, sur le cou dorsal et sur les faces lat\u00e9rales du thorax ont \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9es. La mise en \u00e9vidence des papules \u00e9tait difficile en peau velue et une tonte a facilit\u00e9 leur visualisation. Le diagnostic d\u00e9finitif de FIP a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l'histopathologie et la d\u00e9monstration immunohistochimique des antig\u00e8nes de coronavirus dans les macrophages du rein et des l\u00e9sions cutan\u00e9es. Le cas a \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9 comme un cas mixte de FIP. La reconnaissance de l'association de l\u00e9sions cutan\u00e9es peut faciliter le diagnostic de FIP dans les cas suspects.",
