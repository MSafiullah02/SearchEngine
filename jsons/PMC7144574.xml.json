A notice at the reception desk for patients to self-declare would be helpful. Large departments dealing with outpatient or provider to provider referrals, should consider thermal screening using mass screening systems that measure the skin temperature at high-speed using thermal imaging and temperature measurement equipment as used in airports. Healthcare staff should recognise the symptoms of COVID-19 infection, including fever, dry cough, fatigue and dyspnoea. However they should also be aware of the fact that there are asymptomatic carriers of the virus and a good contact history is of use. It may be prudent to ensure the waiting area has access to hand washing facilities and tissue boxes and masks are within easy reach so patients can be encouraged to follow basic hygiene practices9. The waiting area may need to have enough space so that waiting patients may sit at enough distance, as the risk of transmission increases within three feet27.",

Given current knowledge, the patients should don a surgical mask in order to minimize the risk of transmission while waiting for further management by the appropriate healthcare teams. If the COVID-19 becomes endemic in the UK, giving surgical masks to all patients to wear while they are in the department should be considered. However, this may come at the cost of dehumanizing the patient journey. If possible, their scans should be rescheduled until the results of tests for COVID-19 can be made available.",

It is therefore crucial that potentially infected patients should be identified prior to this step, as physical contact is inevitable for cannulation, and a significant amount of time may be spent with the patient. Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is mandatory if COVID-19 spreads widely in the UK. This consists of eye protection with goggles, surgical masks at least (if N95 masks are unavailable), fluid resistant isolation gown and disposable gloves. However, currently performing procedures with full PPE is difficult at the best of times, and this may affect the ability of staff to handle the same patient load as before. However, these may change in future subject to the volume of positive cases in hospital and departmental catchment.",

In this respect, it becomes even more vital for nuclear medicine reporters to be vigilant and scrutinize the lung windows on each and every CT component as such patients may be asymptomatic and unwittingly transmitting the virus. The imaging findings, while suggestive and appear similar to previous viruses such as MERS or SARS, are non-specific and may be seen in other conditions. Upon identification of potential cases with the appropriate clinical context of acute illness and contact history, relevant patient management and contact tracing should be instituted.",
