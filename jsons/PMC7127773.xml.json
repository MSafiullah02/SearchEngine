Among the sulfonamido nucleosides, however, only a few derivatives with the sulfanilamido group (4-NH2\u2013C6H4\u2013SO2\u2013NH\u2013) have been reported so far. This pharmacophore, found in many biologically active compounds (such as an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease amprenavir),8 is present in 5\u2032-deoxy-5\u2032-sulfanilamido-furanosyl nucleosides A (Fig. 1\n).4b To the best of our knowledge, their biological properties have not been examined.",

Therefore, we decided to examine this method for the transformation of the nitro derivatives 5, 6, and 7 into the amino azanucleosides B. Initially, the reduction of the thymine derivatives 5a\u2013c was examined (Scheme 2\n). Taking into account the NO2-isomerism of 5a\u2013c, the reaction was found to be not general. The reduction of 5a (4-NO2) or 5b (3-NO2) with sodium dithionite in alkaline solution at 90 \u00b0C was accompanied by hydrolysis of the ester group to give the hydroxy derivatives 8a (59%) or 8b (52%), respectively (Scheme 2, conditions (i). Reduction of the 2-NO2 isomer 5c under the same conditions afforded a complex mixture, from which the amino derivative 8c was isolated in 5% yield. Modification of the literature procedure by the use of aqueous sodium dithionite at 90 \u00b0C resulted in the formation of all isomers 9a\u2013c as pivaloyl esters in yields exceeding 50% (Scheme 2, conditions (ii). The 2-NH2 isomer 9c was treated with ammonium hydroxide at 70 \u00b0C to obtain 8c in 79% yield (Scheme 2, conditions (iii)).",
