Mathematical modeling of an epidemic like CoVID-19 is always useful for strategic decision making, especially it is very useful to gain some understanding of the future of the epidemic in densely populous countries like India. We use a simple yet effective mathematical model SIR(D) to predict the future of the epidemic in India by using the existing data. We also estimate the effect of lock-down/social isolation via a time-dependent coefficient of the model. The model study with realistic parameters set shows that the epidemic will be at its peak around the end of June or the first week of July with almost 10 8 Indians most likely being infected if the lock-down relaxed after May 3, 2020. However, the total number of infected population will become one-third of what predicted here if we consider that people only in the red zones (approximately one-third of India's population) are susceptible to the infection. Even in a very optimistic scenario we expect that at least the infected numbers of people will be O(10 7 ).",

Presently, its evaluation is closely monitored by governments, researchers, and the public alike. Every country has limited medical resources, no matter how advanced the healthcare system. Moreover, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing has emerged as the most widely adopted strategy to control the outbreak of the novel corona virus [3] . The Government of India has also announced a nation-wide lock-down starting from 24th March 2020 to reduce the contact rates in the population and slowing down the transmission of the virus. In recent times, epidemiological study for CoVID-19 data of India is started by a many research groups [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] . In this regard, classical epidemiological modeling framework [19, 20, 21] , could be capable of the describing dynamics of CoVID-19 like a pandemic, and predicting the impact of mitigation measures currently undertaken by the Government of India where population density is very high.",

            "text": "The motivation behind using an exponential function is well supported by the fact that for highly infection diseases like CoVID-19 on average a patient infects more than two people which leads to exponential growth. However, this rapid growth can be reduced by imposing conditions like lock-down or administering vaccines to the mass population, etc. and in that case, the initial exponential growth reduces and eventually settle to a constant value where no more new infections reported. This behavior of initial exponential rise saturating to a constant value is parameterized in Eq. (2) . However, note that in this case Eq. (2) is not an unique function which shows this kind of behaviour, we can use other functional form such as f 3 (t) = 1/ a + e b+cx to represent the same behavior. Solid the blue and green line in Fig.(1) corresponds to the best-fit curve with the following values of the parameters a 1 = 34 \u00b1 8, b 1 = 0.202 \u00b1 0.010, c 1 = (1.2 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 2 and a 2 = 1.2 \u00d7 10 4 , b 2 = 0.09, c 2 = 34. As we can see both f 1 (t) and f 2 (t) seems to match the data well in the given period, then the question arises which case shall we believe? To investigate further, we study the derivative of these functions (shown by the dotted lines in Fig. (1) ) which should give us the daily infected patients. We can again see that it is hard to distinguish the two scenarios from the data. However, after April 3 the rate of infected people reduces which also reflects in the derivative and here f 2 (t) better explain both data. Most likely this reduction in infection is due to the ongoing lock-down from March 24, 2020, the effect of which is seen after approximately two weeks as expected. But this kind of fitting the data and predicting the future has it's own limitations, for example, the effect of future lock-down, vaccination, weather conditions that weakens the virus and reduce the virulent of the infection are hard to implement in this case. Also, the fact that recovered patients may act as herd immunity to stop the further spread of the infection is not included in this case. There are a few mathematical models available that incorporate some of the essential features and dynamics of an epidemic and can be used to study and predict the future of an epidemic like CoVID19.",

The SIR(D) model also assumes that the quantities S, I, R, and D are dependent only on time and not on the location. The time rate of change of these quantities are given by the following coupled ordinary differential equations",

The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 approximately represent the average number of contacts a person has during a single day and the reciprocal of the period for which an infected person remains infectious. It is important to check that the solutions of Eqs. (3) (4) (5) (6) should satisfy the constraint S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = N , where N is the total population. This is clearly seen as adding all four equations gives dS dt + dI dt + dR dt + dD dt = 0. It is worthwhile to mention that for many infections, there is a significant incubation period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves. In this case one must take into account this fact while writing the differential equations, however, here we only discuss the SIR(D) model results. In this model, the ratio \u03b3 \u03b2 dictates the number of deaths to the number of infected people and hence it is named as fatality ratio [7] . Now according to the data from medical research all over the world, the CoVID-19 virus has a typical contagious period of around 8-10 days after infecting a person. This isn't an exact figure and can be wrong by a few days give-or-take. This, however, gives us the ballpark figure for \u03b1. We can safely say that \u03b1 should lie somewhere around \u223c 0.1. The exact value can be obtained from the data at hand. Now for \u03b2, obtaining a ballpark may not be as simple.",

As clearly seen, the data and model agree pretty well (except that the data shows sudden change in slope possibly originating due to the lock-down which we discuss later in details). To check the correlation, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and corresponding p-value were calculated (using the scipy package). The correlation coefficient for optimistic and pessimistic scenarios came out to be 0.99, 0.99,0.99 and 0.92,0.98,0.93 respectively (both cases indicate high positive correlation) for infected, recovered and death statistics, and the p-value came out to practically 0 (very small O(10 \u221225 ), and O(10 \u221213 )) for infected and for recovered and the deaths O(10 \u221220 ) , further indicating that the model captures the data trend very well. Going forward with these values of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, the plots for the extended period obtained from the model for the two scenarios are shown in Fig.(3) . This model indicates that for optimistic case the peak of infection should come at around \u223c 150 days from March 22, with the maximum number of infected people being close to \u223c 200 million and approximately \u223c 100 millions death and for the pessimistic case almost the whole population got infected (as can be seen from the suspected population) with the maximum number of people infected at around \u223c 100 days from March 22.",

In an idealized situation where the lock-down continues unless all the states become infection free the total number of infected people in India will be much much smaller than predicted in the previous section because many states like Kerala, Goa, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Manipur, Tripura, etc. are handling the situation quite well (as on 28 April 2020) and are expected to become virus free within next few months if lock-down continues. However, lock-down will likely be relaxed soon and people will travel from one state to another. Now, let us take two hardest-hit states of India Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. We try to explain the data for these two states from the SIR(D) model. the results are shown in Fig.(4) .

Accordingly, for a lower number of susceptible population the number of infected people (and its peak value) will get reduced. In this context exploring the hotspot zones with large outbreak, as defined by Government authority, might be an important input for further investigations. As an example, the hot-spot districts of Maharashtra (MH) with large outbreak and their corresponding populations [24] are listed in Table 1 . If we consider only these hot-spot zones as a total box size for MH, then 50% population size will be reduced. From the hot-spot district to more microscopic zones might provide us more reduced box sizes, for which we can get a reduced peak value of infection for MH.

However, what one must note, is that the parameters chosen for the model aren't unique. For example, with measures like lock-downs and quarantines, the contact between people will reduce drastically, indicating that \u03b1 will reduce to a lower value used here. Consequently, the peak would reduce significantly. According to the model study the peak will appear after approximately 100 days from March 22, 2020, i.e., around the last week of June 2020. We also show the difference between a single and multiple lock-down scenario and found that a large number of deaths may be prevented by imposing multiple lock-downs with interim one month no lock-down periods. Discovery of a working vaccine will of course drastically change the current trend, also hot and humid upcoming summer and monsoon season will provide some barrier to the virus spread. Our work also suggests that the announcement and implementation of a nation-wide lock-down by the Government of India was a right and courageous decision to contain COVID-19.",
