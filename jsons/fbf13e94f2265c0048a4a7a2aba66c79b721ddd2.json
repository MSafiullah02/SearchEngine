            "text": "To the editor, COVID-19 infection is transmitted by the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 and as of March 4, 2020, COVID-19 situation report 44 of World Health Organization (WHO), 93,090 confirmed cases are reported, and 76 countries outside china have been affected (WHO 2020). It has a mortality rate of 4.3% in the initial case series from China (Wang et al. 2020) . Anesthesiologists playing the role as an emergency physician, perioperative physician and intensivists, are at high risk of exposure and acquiring the disease. The recommendations from the renowned anaesthesiology societies are on personal protective equipment (PPE) and precautions to be taken during the intubation and transportation of such patients (Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) n.d.; Perioperative Considerations for the 2019 Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) n.d.; Peng et al. 2020) . In high-income countries, the patients encountered by anaesthesiologists would have already been suspected or confirmed as suffering from COVID-19 and might have the facility for such PPEs. There is a severe shortage of supply of PPEs endangering health workers worldwide as reported by WHO on March 3, 2020 (Shortage of personal protective equipment endangering health workers worldwide n.d.). WHO reports the shipping of nearly half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 47 countries, but supplies seem to be rapidly depleting (Shortage of personal protective equipment endangering health workers worldwide n.d.).",

Individual anaesthesiologists should be determined for personal protection depending on the resource availability, may it be a simple surgical mask and handwashing with soap. Specifically, during preoperative assessment to enquire upon is recent travel (< 2 weeks) to the countries affected by COVID-19 (WHO 2020) , by the patient himself or his family members, neighbours or colleagues. Exposure to such persons, even if the patient is asymptomatic currently, has to be elicited before proceeding with the clinical examination.",

It is the nonadherence to personal protection which has caused disease in health care professionals inspite of the availability of PPEs in the past (Peng et al. 2020 ). Anaesthesiologists should create awareness according to WHO guidelines on PPEs (Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) n.d.) and, as a team leader, ensure the adherence to personal protective measures by all health care workers in the team. I strongly emphasise \"personal protection prior to preoperative assessment\", even before the patients' arrival to operation theatre for anaesthesia, to decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
