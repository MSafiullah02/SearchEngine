            "text": "Influenza viral infections are an impending threat to humans because recent globalization has increased the likelihood of pandemics happening with these highly infectious pathogens (Richard and Fouchier, 2016; Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016). The life cycle of influenza A virus (IAV) begins when it adsorbs to a host cell, it enters it, becomes uncoated, proliferates, assembles into viral particles, and is finally released when it buds away from the cell. The cycle is sophisticatedly regulated by many viral and cellular factors (Medina and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2011). Environmental factors, including the host immune system, also affect viral proliferation and infectivity (Duan and Thomas, 2016). One such critical factor is a group of trypsin-like proteases. These proteases activate viral hemagglutinin (HA), which is required for viral adsorption to sialic acids on the target-cell surface and in the uncoating process that releases viral genomic RNA into the host cell (Fontana and Steven, 2015; Blijleven et al., 2016). Trypsin-like proteases are located across various sites in the host's body. The transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSSs), which include TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and HAT, are present within cells or on cell surfaces. In contrast, some trypsin-type proteases are secreted in the tissues, and plasminogen occurs in the blood. These proteases activate the precursor HA (designated HA0) by cleavage at specific sites to generate the mature HA1 and HA2 conformations (Goto and Kawaoka, 1998; Choi et al., 2009; Kido, 2015). Various trypsin genes (PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3) are expressed in non-pancreatic cells in humans (Wang et al., 2008; Yamamoto-Tanaka et al., 2014; Ghilardi et al., 2015), and some ectopic trypsins can enhance IAV proliferation in rat cardiomyoblasts and the lungs (Pan et al., 2011; Indalao et al., 2017). However, the activation mechanism used by PRSS trypsinogens is unclear, because expression of the physiological activator enterokinase (EK, or TMPRSS15) is reported to be restricted to duodenal epithelial cells. Because the presence of an EK on duodenal cells activates the trypsinogens that are secreted into the alimentary tract from the pancreas to digest food (Kitamoto et al., 1995; Zheng et al., 2009), we hypothesized that a small but substantial amount of EK is likely expressed in many non-duodenal cells, where it activates trypsinogens to cleave HA0 on the influenza viruses, thereby facilitating their infection and proliferation process.",

High levels of HA0 protein were detected in the IAV-inoculated Caco-2, TE671, U937, 293T, Huh7, and NB9 cells, suggesting that IAV replicates efficiently in these cells. Low levels of HA0 protein were detected in HT1080- and A549-inoculated cells, but almost no HA0 protein was detected in HeLa, H292, A431, or Capan-2 cells. To evaluate the factors involved in HA processing, we further examined the expression profiles of transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSSs) and trypsinogens in the cells, using RT\u2013PCR and specific primers (Figure 2). EK was ubiquitously expressed in all the cells we examined, whereas TMPRSS4, TMPRSS2, and HAT were expressed in only some of them (Figure 2A). The lung-derived A549 cells expressed EK, but not TMPRSS4, TMPRSS2, and HAT. In contrast, the other lung-derived H292 and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells expressed substantial level of TMPRSS4, TMPRSS2, and HAT as well as EK. Considering the HA expression patterns in Figure 1 (e.g., high in 293T and Huh7, low in HT1080 and A549, and almost non-existent in H292 and A431), the TMPRSS expression profile was clearly not directly related to HA expression. As for the trypsinogen genes (PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3 in human cells), PRSS1 and PRSS3 were expressed ubiquitously, but the expression profile of PRSS2 was low in A549, H292, and HT1080 cells (Figure 2B). Taken together, it is clear that each cell line expressed some TMPRSSs and PRSSs that are capable of processing HA0 to the active form, although the specific molecules responsible for HA expression and processing were not identified.",

In addition to the canonical EK (TMPRSS15: accession number NM_002772.2), four isoforms (X1\u2013X4) with six transcript variants (accession numbers XM_011529654.1\u2013011529659.1) of EK were predicted using an automated computational analysis of the genomic sequence available in the NCBI GenBank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). The three transcript variants (XM_011529654.1\u2013011529656.1) each encode the same protein isoform (X1) but with different 5\u2032 noncoding regions, and the differences in the coding regions of the X1\u2013X4 isoforms arise from splicing differences between exon 3 and exon 6, including an additional two exons in the canonical EK. We cloned the full-length cDNA encoding the canonical EK from A549 lung-derived cell mRNA (NM_002772.2), and the full-length X2 isoform cDNA from Huh7 liver-derived cells (XM_011529657.1; boxed in Figure 3). Thus, we have designated the canonical cDNA as \u201cEK\u201d and the X2 isoform as \u201cEK-X2.\u201d To further examine the expression profiles of these EK variants in human cell lines, we synthesized specific primers that anneal to exons 2 and 6 of the canonical EK (Figure 4). The expected lengths of the PCR products from EK and EK-X2 were 491 and 581 bp, respectively. The size difference is caused by the insertion of an additional 90-bp exon immediately before the autoproteolysis motif in the SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin) domain of EK (Figure 4C). Canonical EK was endogenously expressed in A549, H292, HT1080, and A431 cells, whereas the EK-X2 isoform was endogenously expressed in A431, Huh7, and 293T cells. Judging from the extra bands, HT1080 cells may express other isoforms in addition to canonical EK (Figures 3, 4B). These data indicate that canonical EK and its isoforms (at least the X2 isoform) are expressed in many cells other than duodenal cells.",

We analyzed two independent, stable clones for each construct to avoid clonal deviation. The major EK protein band (170 kDa), and a slightly larger EK-X2 protein band, were detected in the transfected cells using a specific anti-EK antibody. To assess the extent of HA processing quantitatively, we measured the intensities of HA0 and HA2, and the HA0/HA2 ratio (Figure 5B). Although the amounts of the 65-kDa HA0 precursor and the 25-kDa cleaved C-terminal HA2 fragment showed increases, the 25-kDa HA2 fragment showed a much more stronger increase (thereby elevating the HA0/HA2 ratio) after EK or EK-X2 were exogenously expression compared with the 65-kDa HA0 precursor, indicating that EK and EK-X2 enhanced not only IAV proliferation, but also HA processing. The EK-mediated proliferation of infective IAV was confirmed by the significant increase of virus release into the media (Figure 5C). We also analyzed the function of EK in activating the PRSS3 trypsinogen in vitro (Figure 6). A lysate of 293T cells exogenously expressing a large amount of PRSS3 (Figure 6A) was used as the source of trypsinogen. Although 293T cells endogenously express certain levels of PRSS1 and PRSS3, the lysate exogenously expressing PRSS3 alone (PRSS3 trypsinogen lysate) showed no catalytic activity for a pNA-attached trypsin substrate. Consequently, the authenticity of the substrate was confirmed by the observation that free pNA was markedly released when the PRSS3 lysate was incubated with a purified EK (GenScript, #Z01003). Each 293T cell lysate exogenously expressing EK, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, HAT proteases, or vector alone, was mixed with the PRSS3 lysate and the specific trypsin substrate to measure PRSS3 activation by the transmembrane proteases (Figure 6B). The EK lysate was able to activate PRSS3 in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and HAT were all unable to activate PRSS3, which indicates that only EK can cleave and activate the PRSS3 trypsinogen. A trypsinogen-activating function was also detected in the 293T cell lysates stably expressing EK or EK-X2 (Figure 6C). EK- and EK-X2-mediated activation of PRSS1 and PRSS2 produced marginal results, unlike that with PRSS3 (Figures 6D,E). These findings indicate that PRSS3 is a major activator of EK and EK-X2 in vitro.",

Upon electrophoresis, the mutant proteins were a little smaller than the wild-type proteins (Figure 7A). Although the expression levels of the mutant proteins were more than halve of those of the parental proteins in 293T cells, neither of the mutant EKs displayed enzymatic activity (Figure 7B) or any enhancing effect on HA processing or IAV proliferation (Figure 7C) in the 293T cells compared with those of the control.

The A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) strain requires more trypsin to enhance its proliferation in host cells than the A/WSN/1933(H1N1) strain (Goto and Kawaoka, 1998). The level of IAV proliferation 48 h after infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, as measured by a plaque assay in MDCK cells, was significantly higher in the EK-X2-expressing 293T cells (clone #7-6) than in the 293T cells (Figure 8). Treatment of the IAV strain with trypsin significantly enhanced viral proliferation over 48 h in both 293T and EK-X2-expressing 293T cells (#7-6). The marked increase in IAV proliferation in the 293T cells without trypsin treatment indicates that EK-X2 expression in these cells was able to enhance the proliferative ability of the Aichi strain (in addition to the WSN strain), although the additional enhancing effect of trypsin treatment in the EK-X2-expressing cells suggests that the EK-X2-dependent viral proliferation in the cells was partial and incomplete.",

To access the effect of the exogenously expressed EKs on HA processing, we first analyzed the dynamics of the HA molecules after the 293T cells were infected with different amounts of IAV (MOI = 0.001, 0.01). Cell proteins were western blotted with an anti-HA antibody that detects the 65-kDa HA0 and the C-terminal 25-kDa HA2 fragment (Figure 9A). The 65-kDa HA0 protein was detected in the cell lysates 12 h after IAV infection (MOI = 0.01), and the processed 25-kDa HA2 fragment was observed 72 h after the cells were infected with IAV. HA processing proceeded in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the 293T cells, and was enhanced by the presence of EK and EK-X2 alike, as has already been shown in Figure 5. We next examined HA processing in vitro, by preparing IAV from U937 lymphoma cells because the amount of IAV-HA0 was higher than in the 293T cells where marginal HA0 processing occurs, even at 48 h post-infection (Figure 1). The IAV-HA0-rich cell lysates were incubated with TPCK-treated trypsin or lysates containing EK (Figure 9B). The trypsinogen PRSS3, EK, or EK-X2 alone had no effect on HA0, but HA0 disappeared and HA2 appeared correspondingly after treating PRSS3 with EK or EK-X2, as also occurred after treatment with TPCK-treated trypsin. This indicates that both EK and EK-X2 cleaved and activated trypsinogen to process HA0 into HA1 and HA2\nin vitro and in the cells.",

However, the HA expression level was relatively low in the A549 cells, compared with the 293T and Huh7 cells. Therefore, to clarify the effects of the EK knockdown, we first established an A549 cell line that permitted good proliferation IAV by knocking down the critical signaling molecules that trigger interferon production by sensing IAV infection. Among these signaling molecules (data not shown), the RIG-I knockdown was the most effective at enhancing IAV proliferation and HA expression.",

The drug-resistant cells were pooled to avoid clonal deviation while establishing the stable cell lines. We noted that the RIG-I protein levels reduced significantly when shRNA was expressed in the cells (Figure 10A). Although HA processing was not observed clearly, the amount of HA0 and the release of infective viruses into the culture media were enhanced in the A549 cells by knocking down the endogenous RIG-I with shRNA (Figures 10B,C). We further synthesized two shRNAs (sh-EK#1 and sh-EK#2) targeting different sites in the EK mRNA to knockdown endogenous EK in the A549 cells with a recombinant lentivirus vector. To avoid clonal deviation in the stable cell lines we established, we pooled the drug-resistant cells expressing the verified EK-directed shRNAs in the A549\u2013sh-RIG-I cells. The sh-EK#2\u2013mediated EK knockdown was more effective at reducing the amount of HA0 and the spread of infective virus than that of shEK#1 (Figure 11).

This is one explanation for why knocking down endogenous EK in A549 cells resulted in reduced IAV proliferation (Figure 11). In contrast, the EK knockdown in 293T cells had almost no effect on IAV proliferation (data not shown). This is understandable because 293T cells express both TMPRSS2 and EK, and TMPRSS2 can activate HA even in the absence of EK. Among the TMPRSSs, TMPRSS2 (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2006; Chaipan et al., 2009; Bertram et al., 2010; Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014; K\u00fchn et al., 2016), TMPRSS4 (Chaipan et al., 2009; Bertram et al., 2010; K\u00fchn et al., 2016), HAT (TMPRSS11D) (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2006), matriptase (ST14) (Hamilton et al., 2012), DESC1 (TMPRSS11E) (Zmora et al., 2014), and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) (Okumura et al., 2010; Zmora et al., 2014) have all been reported to cleave and activate IAV HA. Additionally, TMPRSS2 has been shown to be a major target of many IAV strains including H1N1 in vivo by using knockout mice (Kim et al., 2006; Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014), whereas, TMPRSS4 was a target of another IAV strain (H3N1) in vivo (K\u00fchn et al., 2016). As for the WSN strain, it uses plasmin to cleave HA0 with the help of neuraminidase (NA) (Goto and Kawaoka, 1998). These findings show that host proteases play an important role in determining the cell or tissue tropism of an IAV strain. However, the host protease that is used by IAV depends not only on the expression profiles of the relevant proteases in the targeted cell, but other factors that also regulate protease functions, such as EK-related activation of PRSS3. IAV itself affects the selection process by inducing various cytokines such as interferons, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), or by inhibiting various cellular responses in order to replicate in the cell. For example, IAV-induced IL-1\u03b2 stimulates the expression of PRSSs, including PRSS3, in several cell types (Indalao et al., 2017), and elevated PRSS3 protein is activated by EKs to induce HA processing. Therefore, EKs may play a role in IAV pathogenicity and cell tropism via PRSS3.",

            "text": "To effectively prevent or cure IAV infection, therapeutic interventions targeting several molecules simultaneously are worth considering. Developing inhibitors against trypsin-like proteases, such as TMPRSS2 and EK, is warranted because targeting viral proteins, including HA and NA, could stimulate the emergence of resistant mutant viruses, given the highly variable nature of IAV. The characteristic structure of EK, whose catalytic domains are exposed on the cell surface, facilitates the development of inhibitors that have minimal adverse effects. The strict substrate specificity of EK for the DDDDK amino acid sequence makes it particularly suitable for circumventing possible adverse effects. The combined use of EK inhibitors with other reagents may exert the maximal damaging effect on IAV during its infection.",

            "text": "Although no functional differences between EK and EK-X2 were apparent in this study, the insertion of an additional 90-bp exon (encoding 30 amino acids) just before the GSIIV autoproteolysis motif might modify the structure and function of the 118 amino acids of the SEA domain in canonical EK (Figure 4C). As its name implies, the canonical SEA domain was first detected in sea urchin sperm protein, and in EK and agrin proteins also, but its function is not well understood, except that it is known to be involved in the autoproteolysis that causes subsequent functional domains to be shed or the protein to be degraded, and it also has an effect on the carbohydrate chains nearby it (List et al., 2006). Recent advanced search programs have shown that many molecules contain the SEA domain, including some mucins, glycans, phosphatases, and cadherins (Pei and Grishin, 2017). Because the 90-bp exon of EK-X2 is inserted immediately before the autoproteolysis motif in EK, it may affect some EK functions as yet unknown or contribute a new function for the SEA domain. It is intriguing that many cell lines express canonical EK, but some express EK-X2, and possibly other variants (Figure 4B). The Human Protein Atlas project provides information on the overall expression levels of EK without differentiating its variants (The Human Protein Atlas, 2017). EK expression at the RNA level in A549 cells is marginal, compared with that in the brain cancer cell lines U-87 MG and U-138 MG. The very high expression level of EK in brain cell lines requires further examination because EK might be involved in IAV-induced encephalopathy or abnormal psychiatric behaviors. The physiological roles of EK, especially in the lung and brain, after IAV infection in vivo deserve future research.",
