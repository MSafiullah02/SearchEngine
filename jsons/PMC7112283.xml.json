After obtaining written informed consent, study nurses enrolled children admitted to surveillance hospitals from Sunday to Thursday of surveillance weeks. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained from all enrolled children, combined into a single tube of viral transport medium, and promptly delivered to the research laboratories at the study sites. Demographic and clinical information was collected by using a standardized questionnaire, as previously described.6 Comparisons were made between HRV-positive and HRV-negative children and between specific HRV groups. High-risk conditions were assessed and included history of asthma, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, or neuromuscular conditions, such as seizures, cerebral palsy, or muscular dystrophy (analogous to those high-risk conditions listed in the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/ACIP).",

An acute wheezing hospitalization was defined as medically diagnosed wheezing during the current illness documented in the medical record by receipt of an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, code 786.07 during the current hospitalization; any discharge text with \u201cwheezing,\u201d \u201cwheeze,\u201d or \u201cwheezing episode\u201d; or an admission or a discharge diagnosis of asthma, bronchiolitis, or wheezing.38 The third category, a discharge diagnosis of asthma, was defined as any discharge diagnosis of asthma (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, code 493.xx).",
