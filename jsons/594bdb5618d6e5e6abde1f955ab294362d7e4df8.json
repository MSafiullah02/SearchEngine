Of the four Parainfluenza virus serotypes, Parainfluenza 4 is least well characterised from both the clinical, epidemiological and genetic perspectives. Methods: Flocked nose or throat swabs from a previous study investigating viral prevalence in community-based adults suffering from influenza like illness were used as the basis for this study. Samples in which no virus was detected using a 16 viral respiratory pathogen real-time PCR panel were barcoded and pyrosequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium chemistry. The sequences were analysed using the VirusHunter bioinformatic pipeline. Sanger sequencing was used to complete the detected Parainfluenza 4 coding region. Results: A variant Parainfluenza 4 subtype b strain (QLD-01) was discovered in an otherwise healthy adult who presented with influenza like illness. Strain QLD-01 shared genomic similarities with both a and b subtypes. The extent of divergence of this genome from the 5 available whole Parainfluenza 4 genomes impacted the predicted binding efficiencies of the majority of published Parainfluenza 4 PCR assays.",

Four serotypes are known, but most epidemiological and clinical research has been focused on parainfluenza serotypes 1-3. This has been primarily due to the poor growth characteristics in cell culture of parainfluenza 4 (PIV4), the lack of commercial diagnostic reagents, and historical exclusion from routine diagnostic testing [3] . Two antigenically distinct PIV4 subtypes, PIV4a and PIV4b, exist [6] . Functionally and epidemiologically, little is known about the two PIV4 subtypes, however both are capable of co-circulating within the same population [7] . With the advent of reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), it has become easier to screen for an expanded range of RNA viruses, leading to a re-examination of PIV4's epidemiology and role in human disease [2, 3, 5, 8] . The majority of research into PIV4 has focused on children within the hospital setting, however little information is available on the role of PIV4 in disease within the broader community.",

The existence of PIV4 has been known since 1959; however only recently has PIV4 been more appreciated as a respiratory pathogen in its own right through the use of modern molecular methods [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 8] . Modern molecular diagnostics heavily rely on PCR-based techniques. Because of their high specificity, these same methods are susceptible to decreased sensitivity or even false negative results when confronted with even minor changes in target sequences. This limitation is particularly relevant to clinically important pathogens for which little sequence data are available to guide PCR assay development and ongoing evaluation.",

In particular, all four assays contain mismatches at or near their primers' 3\u2032 ends, which are especially sensitive to incorrect base pairing and would potentially lead to decreased primer binding efficiency, and in conjunction with the other primer mismatches, false negative results. These mismatches illustrate the difficulty in designing sensitive PCR assays based on very limited sequence information. Additionally, the use of commercial assays for which primer sequences are not readily available, such as those used in recent PIV4 epidemiological studies [1, 8] , should be used with the understanding that there is no capacity to evaluate the assays' target sequence conservation as new data on emerging variant viral strains becomes available.",
