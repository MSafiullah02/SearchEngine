The mice cleared the virus in 7 days and developed neutralizing antibody in the serum. The mice that recovered from primary infection were protected from reinfection, and, importantly, passive transfer of serum from the mice that recovered from primary infection to naive mice conferred protection from challenge (Subbarao et al., 2004). With this set of experiments, we established the very important principle, that neutralizing antibody alone was sufficient to protect mice from SARS-CoV infection.",

The vaccine was derived from a clinical strain of SARS-CoV, propagated in Vero cells, inactivated with beta propiolactone and subsequently purified. The antigen content of the vaccine was reported in SARS-CoV units (SU), measured in a passive indirect hemagglutination assay rather than by quantitation of protein. The inactivated vaccine was adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide and the control group received saline injections with aluminum hydroxide. The safety of the vaccine had been evaluated in animals, and the dose range and need for adjuvant was determined from preclinical evaluation in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. The study subjects were divided into three groups of 12 (6 males and 6 females) that received 16 SU or 32 SU of vaccine or placebo, given as two doses 28 days apart administered by intramuscular injection. The vaccine was well tolerated, with only mild local reactogenicity and transient transaminase elevation in 3 vaccinees and 1 placebo recipient. The immunogenicity endpoint of seroconversion in 85% of the vaccines on day 56 was achieved in both of the vaccine groups; 100% of the 16 SU group, 91.1% of the 32 SU group, and none of the placebo group seroconverted on day 56. The neutralizing antibody titers were reported in units with respect to a reference serum. The frequency of seroconversion and antibody titers improved with the second dose of vaccine; titers peaked 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine and decreased 4 weeks later. Titers achieved in the vaccinees were about half of those observed in convalescent patients. The authors concluded that the vaccine was safe and immunogenic and warranted further evaluation to optimize the dose and schedule and to assess its efficacy (Lin et al., 2007).",

An open-label study of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity was conducted in 10 subjects, aged 21\u201349 years, who received three doses 28 days apart. The vaccine was administered by injection into the deltoid muscle using a Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System. The vaccine was previously shown to be highly effective in preclinical studies (Yang et al., 2004). Mild injection site and systemic symptoms were reported, but no moderate or severe adverse events were reported. SARS-spike-protein-specific ELISA antibody responses were detected in 8 of the 10 subjects, and neutralizing antibody responses were detected with a pseudotyped lentiviral vector reporter neutralization assay in 8 of the 10 subjects, at one or more time points. Titers peaked between weeks 8 and 12, with detectable antibody in 6 subjects at week 32. However, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in an infectious virus assay. CD4+ T cell responses to the spike protein were detected in all 10 subjects and CD8+ T cell responses were detected in 2 of 10 subjects; these responses followed the same kinetics as the pseudovirus neutralization assay.",

The first clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines began within 4 months of the first report of the new virus.

The average number of revolutions/h that the hamsters ran on the wheel was recorded. Baseline activity level for hamsters was between 700 and 1,000 revolutions/h and decreased by 10-fold or more, to 61 \u00b1 23 revolutions/h following infection with SARS-CoV, returning to normal at 9 to 10 days post-infection (Roberts et al., 2008). This activity measure was applied in assessing the efficacy of a live-attenuated SARS vaccine. Serial passage of the virus in animals can lead to a disease model, as we did with SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2007) and others have previously done for influenza and Ebolavirus. Older mice infected with SARS-CoV displayed clinical disease while young adult mice did not (Roberts et al., 2005, Subbarao et al., 2004). Similar avenues for animal model development are being explored for SARS-CoV-2. In the absence of a disease model, the ability of a candidate vaccine to elicit a neutralizing antibody response against infectious virus associated with restricted replication of challenge virus in the respiratory tract should be demonstrated. Concerns about the safety of coronavirus vaccines were raised with SARS and are now being discussed with SARS-CoV-2. Efforts are underway to design studies in animal models and to develop clinical case definitions to identify vaccine-associated adverse events if they occur.",

The presence of cross-reactive antibodies against human coronaviruses may differ in different age groups. This information will help us place vaccine studies in context and in comparison to the inactivated SARS vaccine from China, which was immunogenic but achieved post-vaccination titers that were half those seen in convalescent patients (Lin et al., 2007). Second, we can undertake studies in animal models to define a protective neutralizing antibody titer. Human sera from recovered patients with a range of neutralizing antibody titers can be pre-administered to a SARS-CoV-2 animal model, followed by challenge infection. The ability of human serum of a specific titer to prevent productive infection in the animal can identify a target titer for vaccines.",
