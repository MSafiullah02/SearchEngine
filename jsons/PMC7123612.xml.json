            "text": "The definition of a zoonosis is that it must affect man but the term is used often outside of medical terminology of animal diseases where man is not involved. Zoonoses are diseases naturally transmitted between animals and man and comprise in total about 80% of all described human infections. Attempts have been made to define different classes of zoonoses according to the man-animal relationship but generally this does not seem to have been accepted. Elton in 1927 stressed the field of wild animal pathology was still virtually untouched, and in 1968 McDiarmid reiterated the view that it remained one of the most neglected aspects of animal ecology. There is now an extensive literature but it is rarely incorporated into ecological texts although disease is often the driving force in population dynamics. The primary driver of infectious disease dynamics is transmission between individuals, yet in most important respects remarkably little is known about the subject (Craft et al. 2008, Haydon 2008). Occasionally, under high population densities, an organism may infect a host outside of its normal range with highly pathogenic effect in its adventitious host.",

            "text": "Human infectious diseases are not distributed at random, contagious diseases are everywhere but zoonotic pathogens are more locally concentrated in the tropics where humans suffer a greater diversity of pathogens. Given the vast number of parasites with which humans have almost daily contact, it is clear that only a small number is able to infect hosts other than those which they actually live upon, thus accidental diseases are rare. Nearly all hosts are resistant to nearly all parasites (Ebert and Bull 2007). Altogether man is subject to more than 1,400 human pathogen species of which over 800 (about 60% of all known species) are shared by man with other vertebrates, mostly other mammals, and relatively few occur as human pathogens only (Woolhouse and Antia 2007). Some 13% are considered as emerging or re-emerging. Within any one species there may be a number of variants of different virulence, different abilities to infect, or with different receptor specificities. Of all the pathogenic species, 208 are viruses or prions,1 37% of which (n = 77) are emerging or re-emerging diseases. Bacteria account for 538 with 10% (n = 54) emerging or re-emerging; protozoa 57 with 25% (n = 14) emerging or re-emerging, and helminths 237 with 3% (n = 10) emerging or re-emerging. Ungulates are the most important overall hosts supporting 250 species of human pathogen, and are the most important source of emerging pathogens with more than 50 species, of which over 40% have the broadest host ranges. The emerging pathogens seem to be mainly viruses (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005).",

Experiments have shown exposure to schistosomes from domestic stock and wild animals reduces severity of infection by the human parasites Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium, and in areas where filariasis or onchocerciasis is endemic man is exposed to repeated infections with filarias of animals which may modify the disease in man (Nelson 1974). Multiple infections of arboviruses in wild animals, a conceptual grouping in which the vector is a blood-sucking arthropod, usually a mosquito or a tick, may provide cross-immunity to the more pathogenic ones, but man, by his change in lifestyle and hygiene, increasingly isolates himself from all infection, thus leaving him without naturally acquired immunity.",

Set against this may be the declining numbers of wild animals and improved hygiene. But with the development of animal husbandry new opportunities for parasitism arose primitively. Cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, and goats, but particularly sheep because of their close association with primitive husbandmen who slept at night with their animals, may have been chronic bearers of infections because they were gregarious and, apart from pigs and goats, pastured on the grasslands of Eurasia in vast herds providing the precise conditions required to allow bacterial and viral infections to become enzootic, the hosts acquiring an immunity but the diseases often being deadly when transferred to man. The process still continues, as for example with swine flu\u2019. When man develops a tolerance to such an adventitious animal disease it becomes endemic in the human population.",

An example is the blind and flightless viviparous earwig species Hemimerus, the only parasitic species of earwig in the Ethiopian Region, seven species of which have become ectoparasites of the giant rats Cricetomys gambianus and C. eminii, spending their entire life history on the rat living on scurf and fungi and therefore possibly commensals rather than parasites. These are in turn are parasitized by two species of mite Andr\u00e9acarus petersi and A. zumpti. Surprisingly, ectoparasites tend to be composed of many species endemic to the Ethiopian Region while the opposite is true of endoparasites. Surprisingly because ectoparasites, in the form of lice, fleas, mites, and ticks, are more readily carried by migratory birds, predisposing towards a wider distribution. But for example, the only elephant arthropod parasite not host specific to elephants, excluding biting flies and ticks, is the calliphorid fly Chrysomia bezziana, larvae of which cause an obligate wound myiasis in a wide range of mammals including man.",

As long ago as 1857 Livingstone was aware of the truth of the matter,Inquiries among the Bushmen and Bakalahari, who are intimately acquainted with the habits of the game, lead to the belief that many diseases prevail among wild animals. I have seen the kokong or gnu, k\u00e1ma or hartebeest, the tsess\u00e9be, kukama, and the giraffe, so mangy as to be uneatable even by the natives. Reference has already been made to the peripneumonia which cuts off horses, tolos or koodoos. Great numbers also of zebras are found dead with masses of foam at the nostrils, exactly as occurs in the common \u201chorse-sickness\u201d. The production of the malignant carbuncle\u2026 is another proof of the disease of the tame and wild being identical. I once found a buffalo blind from ophthalmia\u2026 The rhinoceros often has worms on the conjunction of his eyes\u2026All the wild animals are subject to intestinal worms besides. I have observed bunches of a tape-like thread and short worms of enlarged sizes in the rhinoceros. The zebras and elephants are seldom without them, a thread-worm may often be seen under the peritoneum of these animals. Short red larvae, which convey a stinging sensation to the hand, are seen clustering around the orifice of the windpipe (trachea) of this animal at the back of the throat; others are seen in the frontal sinuses of antelopes; and curious flat leech-like worms with black eyes are found in the stomachs of leches [lechwes].Thomas and Neitz (1933) observed that disease affecting wild animals \u201cwith serious loss to themselves, to stock or man or all three, are by no means rare or unimportant.\n",

At least seven viruses are known to have a natural transmission cycle involving argasid ticks (Plowright et al. 1970). Protozoan diseases transmitted by ticks such as babesiosis or redwater fever, theileriosis or East Coast Fever ECF, Corridor disease; and the rickettsial anaplasmosis or gall-sickness of cattle, caused by unicellular parasites which invade blood cells, particularly erythrocytes; have been implicated in mortality. Although non-clinical, anaplasmosis has been recorded in experimental duiker Sylvicapra grimmia, blesbok Damaliscus dorcas phillipsi, and black wildebeest Connochaetes gnou. It has been suspected as the cause of death in a giraffe and a captive sable antelope died of babesiosis. Fatal theileriosis, formerly attributed to cytauxzoonosis, has been described in giraffe, eland, and duiker, and clinical and histopathological evidence found in a young buffalo (Carmichael and Hobday 1975).",

Although no lion deaths were observed the population dropped from 60 to 15 by death or emigration with lions observed to have many raw patches on their skin. In Nairobi NP a mixture of eight species (S. varipes, S. inornatus, S. taeniatus, S. niger niger, S. transvittatus, S. taeniatus f. brunnipes, S. pallidus, S. calcitrans) had bushbuck as the preferred host by far, followed by black rhinoceros and warthog. Common species such as giraffe, buffalo, and impala, were not detected in blood meals (Mihok and Clausen 1996), contrary to QENP where buffalo was found to be the preferred host after bushbuck (Kangwagye 1977). High numbers of S. varipes were found on a moribund bushbuck in Kenya\u2019s Aberdare Mountains during an apparent die-off of bushbuck (Mihok and Clausen 1996). In April-May 1997 an outbreak of S. omega was reported over more than 2,000 km2 in northern Congo Republic and adjacent areas, apparently leading to mortality among low density forest species, namely bongo (17 deaths recorded), yellow backed duiker (four possible deaths recorded), sitatunga, and forest buffalo, preceded as in some other areas by an outbreak of the large non-biting fly Fainia elongata bezzi. Stomoxys were seen to swarm over the animals causing the bongo to keep moving during the heat of the day until exhausted. Some were recorded as moving away from favoured areas returning later. Examination of the cadavers of four bongo and one buffalo revealed the animals may have been weakened by helminth Elaeophora sagitta infection and possibly low nutrition, forage being poor at the peak of the outbreak, but had been exsanguinated and driven to exhaustion by the Stomoxys (Huchzermeyer et al. 2001). The outbreak followed a prolonged severe dry season succeeded by exceptionally heavy rains (Elkan et al. 2009). Similar climatic conditions were reported for the Ngorongoro Crater outbreak. According to local report Stomoxys outbreaks occur annually in April-May in northern DR Congo but numbers are lower and the duration shorter, not noticeably affecting wild animals.",

A description of buboes found on the heads of fish by al-Maqr\u012bz\u012b can be explained by warty excrescences simply being noticed because of the talk of buboes, some species of fish developing them as secondary sexual characteristics in the breeding season (although the author has not identified any fish from this region that do so), or in the case of the Egyptian anuma this silvery fish has black spots on the dorsal region. Fish can suffer from many diseases, some of which cause swellings on the body. The description of Ibn Iy\u0101s (1453\u20131468) that \u201cThe piercing [i.e. the plague] also occurred to cats, dogs, and savage beasts. One found in the desert the bodies of savage animals with the bubos under their arms. It was the same with horses, camels, asses, and all the beasts in general, including birds, even the ostriches\u201d (Kahle et al. 1960\u20131963), most likely refers to anthrax, in the case of cattle, rinderpest; or starvation through famine where domestic animals had no herders to attend them, simply being associated with the contemporaneous human mortality. Al-Maqr\u012bz\u012b (c1349) likewise described animal deaths, \u201cThe falcons of the chase\u2026 overtook the wild geese or other birds; on the prey was always found a bubo [kubbah] about the size of a hazelnut. Numerous dead birds were found in the fields - crows, kites, and many other birds of all kinds. When they were plucked, one found traces of the bubo. Cats died until practically no more were seen. According to the information that arrived constantly from the Ghaur [Jordan Valley], from Bays\u0101n, and from other neighbouring villages, lions, wolves, hares, camels, wild asses, wild boars, and other savage beasts all lay dead and on them was the trace of the bubo\u201d (Al-Maqr\u012bz\u012b, 1936\u20131958). In Bilbais the majority of dromedaries belonging to the sultan and amirs died. As Dols (1977) noted, despite an abundance of rats known to exist at this period in the Middle East, there is no reference to rats dying as would be expected with bubonic plague.",

Clinical tests conducted at Bombay found the following animals died after injection or feeding of the bacillus: mongoose, squirrel, guinea-pig, rabbit, jackal, dog, hyena, cat, pig, monkeys, and pigeons. Horse, ox, sheep, goat, cat, dog, pig, hens, and geese were affected but recovered, the reaction probably dependent upon the quantity of bacilli received in the case of large animals and the manner of administration. Health of the animal could also be a factor, thus pigeons and sparrows succumbed when starved first. Dogs, while uninfected by being fed the bacilli, passed virulent bacilli in their excreta. Later tests conducted in 1902 showed that calves, hens, turkeys, geese, pigeons, sheep, and pigs, were all susceptible both by inoculation and feeding, pigs and poultry to a high degree (Simpson 1905), but experiments in Natal failed to produce the disease in fowls, pigs, or cattle.

Its incidence in man in Africa is low to sporadic over most of the continent, especially in the low-rainfall zones of the north, east, and south. Most countries report a low to sporadic incidence with the exceptions of Tanzania and DR Congo with moderate, and Nigeria a high, incidence. The major reservoir appears to be in sheep and goats, and thus its incidence in man is highest where contact with small stock is most intimate. The bacteria can survive for up to 6 months in water and in humid organic environments. So far six species are known at least four of which are known to affect man: Brucella melitensis of goats and sheep, Br. abortus of cattle, Br. suis of pigs, reindeer or caribou, and hare, and Br. ovis of sheep; while Br. canis of dogs and Br. neotomae of the desert wood rat Neotoma lepida in America, are little known, the former found in dogs in Madagascar and not on the African continent. Jackals and hyaenas are incidental hosts to both Br. melitensis and Br. abortus.

In 1962 a high incidence was found in QENP in hippopotamus and buffalo; and to the east: eland, one zebra, and one giraffe, were found to be positive. Studies in Serengeti and in Zimbabwe produced further positive reactions in wild animals. In Zimbabwe black rhinoceros, warthog, buffalo, bushbuck, greater kudu (Br. melitensis only), eland, duiker, reedbuck, waterbuck, and impala, were positive. In Serengeti, zebra, buffalo, eland, waterbuck, Thomson\u2019s and Grant\u2019s gazelles, impala, topi, and wildebeest. Black-backed jackal, wild dog, spotted hyaena, and lion, are also affected. Br. suis has been found in rodents in Kenya such as A. niloticus, R. (Mastomys) natalensis, and M. musculus.

In Chad a high prevalence of antibodies was found in wildfowl such as ducks and geese, indicating that surface water has importance in the infection cycle.

In 2004 outbreaks were reported in Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa. Spores can survive in the soil for many years, are resistant to heat and chemicals and can withstand complete dessication, but usually germinate in most soils and are then very quickly destroyed in biologically active soils so they do not build up as might otherwise be the case. Outbreaks occur where the environment favours the persistence of spores, that is, the conditions do not favour germination. Animals are consistently exposed to relatively low doses of these persistent spores but are affected only when their resistance is lowered, as in the dry season. The spores usually enter the bloodstream through an abrasion but can be inhaled or ingested. In the bloodstream they multiply producing a toxin. Immunity can be acquired if an animal survives the disease but is not long-lasting. Anthrax can cause limited epidemics if it contaminates alkaline water, and it could be introduced with imported skins taken from animals which have died in an epizootic, or from skinning such animals, or contact with infected horses if a rider had sores or wounds rubbing against the horse\u2019s coat. Veterinarians have contracted it in the palm of the hand from inoculating herds of cattle, the skin becoming abrased and picking up the bacteria from the animal\u2019s coat.

It is called Silonda\u201d (Schapera 1963). It was reported in Cape Province in 1876 when it was referred to as \u201csplenic apoplexy\u201d. In South Africa sporadic outbreaks have occurred in zebra, kudu, springbok, and hartebeest. In 1959\u20131960 there were over 1,000 mortalities in Kruger NP.",

Contaminated dead flies remained infective indefinitely, and spores also passed via the larva to the imago. Infective spores could be carried on legs and wings for at least 10 days and could be alive still after 3 years. Moore had suggested in 1853 flies could be possible carriers (as well as of cholera, typhoid, tuberculosis, and leprosy), and Raimbert performed the first experiments using both biting flies and house and blow flies to demonstrate transmission by flies in 1869, placing them on infected material and then showing by inoculation of the legs, wings, and mouthparts, into guinea pigs that the bacilli had been present.

But the relation to density is complex, for the bigger the population the greater the chance of an individual picking up spores, and the greater the number of deaths the greater the surviving population of spores. To become infected it appears an impala must encounter a patch of infected ground or pool of water, and the spores must enter the blood stream through internal abrasions. Close grazing of tough scratchy forage in dry times can result in such abrasions in the mouth. Tough and closely cropped swards have their largest extent at the end of the dry season and depend upon the size of the herbivore populations using them. Infection in the intestinal tract may take place via lesions caused by internal blood-sucking parasites such as Haemonchus spp., parasite loads increasing also in the dry season when the host is weakened, and with host density. In Kruger NP, while other species succumbed heavily in outbreaks, impala mortality was minimal.",

In early 1932 \u201ca mysterious disease\u201d killed numbers of hippopotamus at the south-east end of Lake Albert, 60 dead being counted at one time. The cause was undetermined but again was probably anthrax. The following year a similar outbreak of disease occurred in Lake George killing at least 50\u201370. Some carcases floated down the Kazinga Channel but did not infect herds in Lake Edward. According to native report some animals came out on land with blood issuing from the mouth and nostrils (Pitman 1934). At the end of May 1937 a number of carcases, 17 were counted, was seen floating down the Kazinga Channel from Lake George, but again no deaths were reported in Lake Edward (Pitman 1938). In February and March 1941 unexplained mortality on a considerable scale occurred in the Uganda reach of the Semliki River, hippopotamus deaths having been recorded near the river\u2019s exit at Lake Edward at the beginning of February. In July to August mortality occurred also at the southern end of Lake Edward, still taking place in March 1942. Further mortality was reported on the DR Congo side in 1944. In March-April many deaths occurred in the lower Rutshuru River in Virunga NP. Following an exceptionally low Nile in 1944, mortality on a considerable scale occurred in December 1945 between the Lake Albert delta and Murchison Falls, several hundred carcases floating into the lake.

In the now QENP in 1956 there was a suspected outbreak of anthrax when more than 80 hippopotamus died. It appeared to spread inland from the Lake Edward lakeshore at Lion Bay where there was a high population concentration, and mortality was particularly high in two inland wallows. The disease was observed to break out suddenly, taking a regular toll over 6 weeks and then stopping abruptly, not spreading from the small area affected. Mortality was mainly among adult animals and was estimated at about 15% of the population in the affected area (Bere 1957). Mud samples from wallows and samples of bones were examined in 1958 but all proved negative (Guilbride et al. 1962). Further outbreaks were suspected in 1959, 1962, 1991, and a confirmed outbreak beginning in Lake George in August 2004, the latter being the most devastating recorded culminating in a total of 317 known deaths, representing 16% of the then population estimated at 2,000. An estimated 60 buffalo representing 0.9% of the population, and a few elephant, warthog, kob, and waterbuck, succumbed also. As attempts were made to limit spread the outbreak may have been more extensive if it had been allowed to run its course.",

In a sample of 90 warthog, which appeared outwardly in good condition, 8.8% were infected, four confirmed as M. bovis, the other four were atypical mycobacteria (Guilbride at al. 1963). Thurlbeck et al. (1965) found four of five apparently ill buffalo examined there had chronic lung disease which they attributed to bTB, and one appeared to have an Actinobacillus lignierisii infection of the lung, an ubiquitous sporadic bacterial infection not usually associated with the lungs. Woodford (1972), in studies conducted about 1970, found 10% (n = 52) of buffalo collected at random were infected with bTB, and from 20% to 55% of those selected as old or debilitated in appearance. The map, Fig. 23.1, shows the incidence of infection in different sectors of the Park. A high incidence, 5\u201334%, was reported in cattle in adjacent Ankole in 1937\u20131941, and 44% of slaughterhouse samples in 1962. Thus the incidence around QENP was extremely high. No infection was noted south of the Maramagambo Forest where according to local report no cattle were known to have been kept historically. North of the forest was historically a dense cattle-keeping area until destroyed by raids in 1871. Stanley (1890) found the plains empty of cattle in 1889 but areas were rich in sheep and goats. Woodford (1972) found no evidence of bTB in a sample of 420 sheep and goats (about 25% of the total) from villages in the Park. Cattle populations which returned to the area after the assumption of British control were then affected by nagana and most were either dead or removed by 1924, a total of 15,000 being reported as removed that year (Spinage 1982).

An epizootic in the 1980s is thought to have corresponded with only 70 susceptible individuals, whereas that in 1994 did not emerge until all of the population of 250 lions was susceptible. This implies that infection existed in other species in the early 1990s so that the pool of susceptibles in the ecosystem was far larger than it had been in the 1980s (Packer et al. 1999). Spotted hyaena and wild dog also experienced high morbidity and mortality from the disease in 1994, which may have been facilitated by severe drought in 1993 bringing animals together at water points, as well as the animals being stressed and having lowered resistance to high levels of coinfection with other pathogens.",

The leopard is likely to contract it only by contact with infected prey such as a dog, and although it might then infect a mate, the general solitary nature of this species means the infection would most likely be dead-end.

Other than the presence of CDV, five other viruses were studied: feline immunodeficiency virus FIV (a member of the Family Retroviridae which includes HIV and a number of other genera affecting a wide range of birds and mammals); felid herpesvirus (herpes viruses affect a wide range of mammalian hosts including elephant, zebra, and wildebeest); feline parvovirus (there is a number of related parvoviruses one of which is ubiquitous in pigs throughout the world); feline corona virus (corona viruses are widespread in nature); and feline calcivirus (worldwide in domestic cats and also isolated from captive cheetahs). Feline leukaemia virus FeLV was not found. With the exception of corona virus, which may be transmitted by ticks or mosquitoes, these are not known to be arboviruses. Infection of FIV is by blood (through biting), herpes orally and by aerosol, parvovirus orally, corona virus and calcivirus orally and by aerosol. All populations showed consistently high levels of seroprevalence, indicating previous exposure to FIV and herpes and that chronic infection was enzootic. All but two of 374 lions had been exposed to herpes, including eight cubs less than 1 year of age. The other viruses were absent from the populations for periods of 4\u201312 years followed by resurgence, indicating epizootics took place, the sporadic nature being most evident in the youngest age classes. The precise timing of each outbreak differed between the Serengeti and Ngorongoro populations. Calcivirus was absent from the relatively small and isolated Ngorongoro population, as was parovirus among immature but not adult Ngorongoro lions. Parovirus, coronavirus, and calcivirus, varied significantly over time among immatures in the Serengeti, indicating epizootic outbreaks. In the Serengeti, corona virus and parovirus infection occurred typically in years of high lion population density. Almost every lion was FIV positive by the age of 4 years, and about 80% of 1\u20132 year olds. None of the viruses appeared to consistently affect fecundity but there could be strain differences. A high annual variation around the 1990 calicivirus and 1993 coronavirus epizootics the authors found difficult to interpret, suggesting it reflected other ecological factors such as annual variation in prey availability, population density, and social dynamics. Cub survival was significantly reduced during a calcivirus outbreak in 1980, but although survival was below average in a 1985 outbreak, cubs enjoyed higher survival than average than they did in a 1990 outbreak. The enzootic FIV and herpes had no apparent effects upon the populations. None of the epizootic viruses consistently lowered host fitness but the 1980 calcivirus outbreak may have inflicted considerable cub mortality. Other outbreaks appeared harmless, this apparent lack of pathogenicity possibly due to strain differences. Nothing is known of the reservoirs of these viruses, their mode of transmission from the reservoirs, nor their prevalence and effects in other species. The epizootic nature appears dependent upon the attainment of a threshold level of susceptibles.",

It occurs in three forms: European or sheep-derived, African or wildebeest-derived, the latter causing almost total mortality in cattle; and a recently isolated form in American white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in which it is highly virulent, closely related to the sheep virus but of which the reservoir host has not been identified (Li et al. 2000). In Africa it tends to be localized in occurrence, recurring at the same locality. The Maasai believed it was derived from wildebeest placenta and traditionally avoided wildebeest calving grounds, but research has shown that although post-natal wildebeest are infective the placenta is not the source. The virus has been isolated from the eyes and nose secretions of calves of a few days to less than 3 months of age. Older wildebeest have antibodies to the virus which is found within the cells of different organs. The calves are thought to contract it in utero and appear relatively immune. Transmission to cattle may be by aerosol or contaminated water or pasture, or possibly arthropod vectors. Cattle do not infect one another thus the disease is not epizootic. It has a long incubation period in cattle of 3\u20137 weeks, possibly longer, with most animals dying within 4\u20135 days of the onset of symptoms. Thus the cattle could move a considerable distance from the source of infection before succumbing. Some wildebeest, and probably cattle also, retain infection for life. A clinically pathogenic strain of the virus has been isolated from hartebeest A. b. cokei, and avirulent strains from topi and oryx, which might be carriers; but none of these three species has been implicated in the epizootiology of the disease.",

Two bovine calves reared with the wildebeest acquired infection also after maximum incubation periods of 47 and 81 days, but further cattle exposed later did not become infected (Plowright 1965).

In Tanzania presence of the disease is recorded only in January to May, peaking in March to April, while in Kenya it tends to peak in April to July. As viraemia falls after 3 months it does not occur after June in Tanzania and August in Kenya. Although it can be recovered from wildebeest of all age groups, all wildebeest over the age of 7 months in the three main population groups in East Africa possessed neutralizing antibodies, persisting at a high level throughout life. A proportion of calves acquire antibody very soon after birth and this is probably derived from the maternal colostrum, but about half of those examined did not do so. This may have been due to not obtaining colostrum during the critical 24\u201336 h after birth on account of separation from the dam, permanently or temporarily. Exposure to stress after birth from chasing by predators, particularly hyaenas, may inhibit antibody absorption. Passively-acquired antibody does not protect the calf from infection. Likewise recovery of virus from the blood of yearlings indicates that it is protected from neutralization, presumably by its intracellular location (Plowright 1967a). After the initial stage it is not transmissible to cattle which Plowright (1968) regarded as unusual hosts. It denies cattle access if wildebeest are present to the highly nutritious grass flush which emerges after the rains.",

But Spinage (1969a) found that two adult female defassa waterbuck from western Uganda carried more than 2.5 and more than four times as many nymphal and larval stages as they did adult ticks, while a male had 217 times more nymphal and larval stages on its legs than adult ticks, and the fore half of its body above the legs had 1,780 nymphs and larvae and no adult ticks. In all cases the species were mainly R. tricuspis and some A. cohaerens, but H. nitidum and H. rufipes have been recovered from waterbuck in CAR, and H. truncatum in Cameroun. In a study in South Africa van Dyk and McKenzie (1992) found nymphs and larvae outnumbered adult ticks on impala by more than twice, with an average total of all stages of around 1,500/impala. This suggests that by sheer numbers alone large herbivores are probably more important than small mammals or birds as possible amplifiers of CCHF infection. In the laboratory newborn wild rodents bitten by infected ticks can succumb fatally, but the role of CCHF virus in causing rodent mortality has not been investigated.",

Widespread in the Sudan and many parts of East and Equatorial Africa, it exists in an enzootic state in Chad and Northern Cameroun as well as occurring sometimes in South Africa and sporadically overall in at least 24 sub-Saharan African countries. It appears to fluctuate according to long-term climatic cycles, wetter conditions favouring the mosquito vectors by which it is principally spread, including Eretmapodites, Aedes (Ochlerotatus), Culex, Mansonia, and Anopheles species, with a possible natural reservoir in a phlebotomine fly. It is passed in mosquitoes to the next generation through transovarial transmission, but in sheep experimentally by contact also. Buffalo may be susceptible to it and numerous wild animals were affected in an epizootic in South Africa in 1951. In Chad antibodies have been found in buffalo, reedbuck, red-fronted, Dorcas, and Dama gazelles, topi, and oryx.

Prior to the end of 1950 it was not known in South Africa until in December of that year there was a number of reports of heavy mortality in cattle and sheep in the western area of the Free State. By 1951 it was present in the Northern Cape and Southern Transvaal also, areas characterized by wet valleys, pans, and lakes, which were filled by heavy rains in 1950; but it is not known from whence or how the disease was introduced (Alexander 1951). Subsequent epizootics led to the surmise the disease was persisting in circumscribed enzootic foci, considered to be two heavily wooded areas on the Cape and northern Natal coasts, with epizootic spread triggered by exceptionally wet seasons favourable to the vectors (Swanepoel 1981).

Although epizootic areas have been identified in both Zimbabwe and South Africa these may simply reflect the main stock rearing areas. In 1969 there was a large outbreak in Mozambique to the east, and in 1974\u20131975 there were widespread epizootics in South and South-West Africa. Routine screening showed continued presence of the virus in Zimbabwe in inter-epizootic years, the next epizootic accompanying particularly heavy rains in 1978 when it is estimated to have killed 3% of the national herd. If affected females survive the infection they commonly undergo spontaneous abortion, virtually all pregnancies being lost in the Zimbabwe outbreak. McIntosh and Jupp (1981) claimed there was a reasonably good correlation between outbreaks and periods of higher rainfall in South Africa from 1938 to 1978, predicting a high probability of severe outbreaks again in the 1990s based on predictions of rainfall cycles.

Cx. theileri is the most prevalent and widespread mosquito in the epizootic area, is relatively resistant to aridity, and feeds mainly on sheep and cattle, which have probably supplanted its former wild hosts. It feeds readily on man also. Little reliable evidence was obtained in Natal to implicate mosquitoes as vectors of the enzootic infection among cattle in the coastal region, and no evidence was obtained to suggest mosquitoes were involved in maintenance of the virus, but Ae.circumluteolus, C. zombaensis, and Er. quinquevittatus, were considered probable incidental vectors. In the 1930 epizootic in Kenya a high mortality among rodents A. abyssinicus nairobi\u00e6 and R. rattus kijabius was noted, but evidence of the virus is rare in sampled rodents, although antibodies have been found in a wide range of species throughout sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal and Niger through East Africa and Zambia. The fact that in Uganda the virus was isolated from mosquitoes in an uninhabited area suggests existence of a wild reservoir, but it seems monkeys do not play this role, and birds do not play any role, so the natural reservoir remains unknown (Br\u00e8s 1981).",

The first record north of sub-Saharan Africa and the first record of substantial human pathogenicity. It subsided with the colder weather in mid-December but in 1978 broke out again and spread to the Sinai infecting soldiers there. The first cases of animal disease appeared to have occurred as early as July or August in southern Egypt, the subsequent epizootic causing mortality and abortion in sheep, cattle, domestic buffaloes, and camels. Another outbreak began in 1993. It is suggested its emergence in Egypt was due to the large mosquito populations produced by the Aswan dam floodlands, the virus being isolated from C. pipiens, the most common mosquito collected, although the isolation rate was low. Rodents, black rat, A. niloticus, Acomys c. cahirinus, and M. musculus, did not appear to play a major role in the epizootics. Sudan had epizootics in 1973 and 1976 and it is considered infection probably came from there with imported camels, 15% of which were found to have antibodies to the virus. The anopheline mosquitoes which transmitted it in Egypt, A. caballus, A. circumluteolus, and A. theileri, feed on camels, sheep, and cattle.",

It is well adapted to long term survival in a cycle involving arthropods and wild suids unique to Africa where it has existed for millennia (Penrith et al. 2004). Its importance is an economic one, and until domestic pigs were introduced south of the Sahara, Penrith et al. suggest by the Portuguese about 500 years ago, its cycle was entirely sylvatic, but it is now enzootic among many domestic pig populations in which it can be highly virulent. Wallace (1876) considered the true pig Sus was absent from the Aethiopian region, but Barth (1857\u20131858) encountered a domestic pig in the Chari basin writing, \u201cNever in any part of Negroland, have I seen this animal in such numbers as here about the Shari\u201d. He considered it was the domestic pig of Sennar, Sus sennaarensis, but there is debate as to whether this is a true species.

            "text": "The main reservoir of ASF is warthog, to a lesser extent bushpig, and probably giant forest hog Hylochoerus meinertzhageni in which there is a single record. Although the disease had been seen in South Africa since 1900, it was first diagnosed in Kenya in 1910 when the presence of warthogs in the vicinity of every farm on which it had occurred was noted (Montgomery 1921). Montgomery stated simple contact was a very sure way of transmitting the infection but experimental transmission by contact between warthogs, or warthogs and domestic pigs, rarely occurs. He suggested infection might be maintained in the wild by the carnivorous habits of wild suids and that there must be some unknown reservoir, while a suggestion was made in 1933 that transmission might be by an intermediate host such as a winged insect. The main transmitter is now established as the eyeless argasid or soft tick Ornithodoros porcinus (=moubata) porcinus, the \u201ceyeless tampan\u201d, found in considerable numbers in warthog burrows and sometimes infected with the virus, although how the virus is transmitted in apparently tick-free areas remains unexplained. Large amounts of the virus can apparently be inoculated by unfed first stage nymphs, implying transovarial transmission although this route of infection may not be high. Naturally infected O. m. porcinus fed on domestic pigs regularly transmit the disease and they presumably play an important role in disseminating the virus among warthog populations. Infected fourth or later stage nymphs were collected from a single burrow in QENP where the virus was not present in many thousands of adult ticks examined, and 1495 ticks from the same burrow were also found to be free of it. It was demonstrated the virus could multiply in the tick host and persist for at least 15 months, although in others it disappeared within four. Experimentally it has been maintained in a transmissible state for 3 years. The tick hosts appear unaffected and the relatively constant and high levels of viral maintenance suggest an ability to regulate viral replication to keep it compatible with host survival. The amount of virus, and hence quantity of blood, a tick needs to be infective has not been found in sufficient concentration in warthogs, thus either there is an alternative vertebrate host in the same habitat capable of supporting a high ASF viraemia, the period when the virus is circulating in the blood, or young warthogs from birth to 6\u20137 weeks may exhibit a temporary high level viraemia following first infection. Rates of infection increase slowly with each tick developmental stage but with an abrupt increase, usually six-fold, between the last nymphal and adult stages, females having markedly higher rates than males. This higher rate is thought likely due to an increasing size of blood meals and in the case of adults, transmission of the virus by the male in copulation, shown to be as high as 88% in laboratory ticks.",

Pliny cA.D. 70 noted \u201ceven camels are liable to rabies\u201d. From the end of the 1960s it has been reported with increasing frequency in many parts of Africa, particularly exemplified by Natal which has experienced a sharp rise in cases beginning in the 1980s, and in Kenya from 1981 onwards. This increasing frequency appears caused by an increasing human population with domestic dog ownership. It is not a disease known to have caused epidemics and is relatively insignificant as a mortality factor, but it is a widespread lethal disease hosted by wild species. It is a Lyssavirus, the genus of the Family Rhabdoviridae, capable of producing fatal encephalitis in a wide variety of mammal species. The type species is distributed worldwide and is enzootic in the tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions of Africa, where it undergoes sporadic epizootic cycles. But Africa is home to six other species also: Lagos bat virus isolated from fruit bats in Nigeria, CAR, and South Africa; Mokola virus, isolated from man in Nigeria in 1968 infection of which may prove fatal, shrews Crocidura spp. in Nigeria and Cameroun, harsh-furred mouse Lophuromys sikapusi in CAR, rodents in South Africa, and cats and dogs in Zimbabwe; and may be transmissible by mosquitoes. Duvenhage virus is found in the bat Nycteris thebaica in Zimbabwe and other insectivorous bats in South Africa where a man bitten by a bat died from it; Nigerian horse virus is known to affect horses only; Obodhiang virus found in Mansonia uniformis mosquitoes in the Sudan, and Kontokan virus in Culicoides midges in Nigeria, antibodies of which have been found in domestic herbivores, wild rodents, and insectivores, causing a disease resembling bovine ephemeral fever.",

However Thunberg (1793\u20131795), travelling to Kaffraria in 1772, having crossed the Gouds River to Daniel Pinard\u2019s farm, was informed the Rabies canina and vulpina had prevailed, meaning that dogs and jackals were affected. Burchell (1822\u20131824) was somewhat equivocal, writing in 1812 both that it was unknown and that it was rare, \u201cThe hydrophobia or canine madness, is unknown in these regions; and indeed in the whole of the southernmost part of Africa. Even in Cape Colony this dreadful disorder is so rare, that I never heard of an instance of it during the 5 years of my being in that part of the globe\u201d. Shepstone alluded to an outbreak at Wesleyville in 1823 (Cluver 1927) and Kay (1833) noted, \u201cIt has been asserted, by a highly respectable writer on the Cape, that canine madness and hydrophobia form no part of the diseases indigenous to Southern Africa: the author, however, had here an opportunity of witnessing a most decided case of this kind in October 1827; and many others, equally direful, have taken place in different parts of the colony\u201d. He recorded also that immense swarms of dogs were met with everywhere, constituting one of the chief nuisances of the country. Livingstone wrote in 1845, \u201cA kind of madness previously unknown to the natives appeared last year among the dogs, but it differs essentially from Hydrophobia. As a precautionary measure I have excised the bitten parts of all those who applied for assistance. The disease appeared to be communicated to a child and a calf. Both died\u201d (Chamberlin 1940). Later he wrote, \u201c\u2026 I learned that Maleke, a chief of the Bakwains\u2026 had been killed by the bite of a mad dog. My curiosity was strongly excited by this statement, as rabies is so rare in this country. I never heard of another case, and could not satisfy myself that even this was real hydrophobia\u201d (Livingstone 1857). It seems most likely it was rabies in both instances, for Oosterzee, Wehr, and Hartley, in 1886 described symptoms of hydrophobia in a man allegedly bitten by a mad dog. But the first authenticated report in South Africa is credited to Hutcheon in 1893, traced to a dog imported from England (but probably infected locally). It was first recorded in Zimbabwe in 1902.",

The Ethiopian wolf in the Bale Mountains was seriously affected by an epizootic in the early 1990s, reducing survival rates by 70\u201375% and threatening the species with extinction. In West Africa the domestic dog is regarded as the primary reservoir host, but there are few studies of wild carnivores although it has been reported from a civet cat Civettictis civetta in Nigeria (Kasali 1977).",

Rats and mice commonly carry antibodies to it but contact transmission among rodents is rare and their role as the natural host has been questioned (Alexander 2004). Normally infections are subclinical but depending upon the host and the viral strain it can be fatal. It caused the deaths of eight captive African elephants, and an irruption of rats in Kruger NP in 1993\u20131994 resulted in an outbreak in wild elephants, causing acute mortality from heart failure of 64 animals widely scattered in the Park. No increased mortality was observed in other animals in the Park (Grobler et al. 1995) but at the end of November 1993 an epizootic of EMC broke out in tree squirrels Paraxerus cepapi in the far north of the Park at a time when it was considered there may have been a population irruption of rodents, occurring also in adjoining Mozambique. Antibodies were found in black rat, Aethomys chrysophilus, M. natalensis, Saccostomus campestris, and Tatera leucogaster; but apart from the first two species not until the epizootic was advanced. In mid-1994 there were reports of a rodent plague in the Limpopo Valley to the west of Kruger NP. The rodent outbreak declined rapidly after June 1994. An analogous countrywide population explosion of rodents had last occurred in South Africa in 1968. EMC has long been known to be present in South Africa and it may have been continuously present in Kruger NP, but no similar outbreak of disease in elephants has been recorded since records began in the late 1950s. It was present in elephants in 1987, and in 1993 and 1994, 53.5% (n = 116) and 14.5% (n = 172) respectively tested positive. It is not known whether contagion or indirect transmission occurs between elephants.

Dissemination from an infected animal is mainly through secretion, excretion, and expiration of the virus. It has been detected in the ambient air surrounding cattle and thus can be spread by wind. Cattle may appear to recover completely from an infection but then remain carriers for up to 2 years afterwards. Worldwide more than 20 Families have been found susceptible to infection whether naturally or experimentally, and at least 19 species of African mammal, namely: East African hedgehog, African porcupine, mole rat, field rat A. abyssinicus, tree hyrax Dendrohyrax sp., warthog, buffalo, bushbuck, kudu, eland, grey duiker, waterbuck, springbok, impala, hartebeest, wildebeest, roan and sable antelope, and gemsbok (Macaulay 1964). Thus we may suppose that all artiodactyl ungulates are probably susceptible and many other species also, but few are carriers. Birds may play a significant role in indirect transmission over long distances. An experimentally infected kudu died 7 days after infection but epizootic outbreaks have not been reported in game. In cattle it is more virulent than in buffalo but many African breeds react with mild clinical symptoms only. It was enzootic among cattle in Europe until the end of the nineteenth century so cattle migrating south in Africa probably already carried their own strains, but introduction to the African strain may have presented an added challenge to invading cattle populations.",

Most young buffalo acquire infection soon after maternally derived passive immunity wanes at between 3 and 8 months of age, but the majority of these infections is unapparent. Infection with SAT1 and 2 has been maintained in a small isolated herd of less than 100 animals for at least 24 years, indicating that carriers play a role in maintaining the virus in buffalo herds, but carriers are generally inefficient transmitters and six carrier buffalo in experimental conditions failed to transmit infection to their calves. Experimentally, infection could be passed to cattle only by keeping buffalo and cattle in close contact for 2 years. Acutely infected buffalo with high concentrations of virus failed to transmit SAT1 virus to cattle sharing feeding and watering facilities in the same enclosure but not maintaining close contact. In another experiment, buffalo acutely infected with SAT2 virus which mixed freely with cattle, quickly transmitted the infection. However, when these cattle were replaced with others, infection failed to take place. Acutely infected buffalo failed also to transmit the virus to impala under similar experimental conditions (Gainaru et al. 1986). In six of ten buffalo isolated together, SAT1, 2, and 3 were present, but 1 year later two only showed SAT3 present, and 15 months later one animal only was still positive, presence of the virus always being low (Bengis et al. 1986). None of the cattle kept with these animals showed any evidence of infection. Thus acutely infected buffalo do not invariably transmit the virus and by 4 weeks following infection at least a high proportion are no longer secreting it. In the wild therefore only buffalo in acute stages of infection with SAT type virus, which probably would mean young animals only, are likely to provide a source of infection for other species, and then only where close contact occurs. But Gainaru et al. (1986) suggest indirect transmission by oxpecker birds Buphagus spp. or arthropods remains a possibility. The common means of infection among domestic stock is through contaminated food, and earthworms have been found to take up the virus from contaminated soil and become infective to pigs (Fletch 1970).",

In the Kalahari large concentrations of game migrate in the dry season from the interior to the cattle rearing areas of southern Botswana and, until they were restricted by fences, into Namibia and South Africa. Falconer (1972) pointed out that if a reservoir of FMD infection had been maintained in game, cattle populations in these adjacent areas would have been repeatedly infected, but no outbreaks had been recorded since 1948. In 1957 an outbreak had spread to southern Botswana when cattle had been vaccinated and the game had become heavily infected, but there was no further outbreak, indicating an inability on the part of the various wild species to harbour the disease for any length of time. No virus was recovered from small samples of springbok (n = 9), hartebeest (n = 10), and wildebeest (n = 10) in 1970, and not one showed any immunity. Buffalo however disperse away from permanent water during the wet season and may play a role in dissemination of the virus.",

            "text": "SAT1 and SAT2 type viruses were recovered from buffalo in the Savuti area of northern Botswana during a 1968 outbreak of SAT1 type in the Chobe area. In 1969 all three types were recovered from about half of a sample of 62 buffalo, some having high antibody levels. In 1970, 20 buffalo, ten bushbuck, and ten impala, were sampled near Kasane (Chobe area); and 20 buffalo, ten impala, ten tsessebe, and ten wildebeest, from Magwee. Near Kasane half of the buffalo had virus and high antibody levels for all three virus types, the bushbuck and impala had no virus and antibody levels were minimal. From the Magwee area only two of the 20 buffalo sampled had virus, and impala, tsessebe, and wildebeest, had minimal levels of antibody only. Thus SAT2 appeared to have existed in buffalo without transferring to cattle as it had never been recorded in cattle in Botswana. In general the buffalo maintained high levels of immunity against all three types and the disease was probably being maintained in the occult form. It has been suggested that a climatic or a stress factor when buffalo moved out of the swamps could activate the disease, resulting in outbreaks when other species of wild animal might also be exposed to larger amounts of virus and contract the disease (Falconer 1972).",

            "text": "For long considered a mystery, sarcocystis was eventually identified as a coccidial protozoan. Worldwide in occurrence it is found as small sacs filled with spores in the muscles which in domestic stock characteristically causes a chronic subclinical infection in the cardiac and/or skeletal muscles and can give rise to encephalitis, abortion, or premature birth. It requires two hosts, the definitive host in which a sexual cycle takes place being a carnivore or omnivore which consumes the spores. This might be avian such as a vulture, but it is common in lions in South Africa. When the sarcocysts are ingested bradyzoites liberated by digestion in the stomach penetrate the mucosa of the small intestine and transform into male (micro) and female (macro) gametocytes within hours and conjugate forming an oocyst, which then sporulates. Both sporulating and fully sporulated oocysts have been found in the skeletal muscle of baboons in South Africa which are frequently both intermediate and definitive hosts (Markus 1978). The intermediate host becomes infected by ingesting the sporocysts releasing sporozoites in the small intestine, their further development unknown until they appear in the mesenteric arteries and lymph nodes where they eventually liberate merozoites into the blood initiating development of the sarcocysts in muscle, bradyzoites being formed, the infective stage for the consumer (Markus et al. 2004). First described from Korin gazelle Gazella rufifrons in the Sudan as Sarcocystis gazellae in 1913, it was followed by S. bubalis in Coke\u2019s hartebeest, S. woodhousei in Grant\u2019s gazelle, and unnamed species in grey duiker, reedbuck, Uganda kob, Thomson\u2019s gazelle, topi, and wildebeest. Mandour and Keymer (1970) described it in bushbuck, greater kudu, puku, common water buck, defassa waterbuck, and Grant\u2019s gazelle. That in defassa waterbuck was described as a new species S. nelsoni. Sarcocystis sp. have been found also in buffalo in CAR.",

            "text": "ECF, or theileriosis, the Texas fever of America, is a protozoal infection caused by Theileria parva parva which invades the lymphocytes, vector borne by hard ticks. In 1977 it was estimated 500,000 cattle died each year in East Africa alone despite attempts at tick control and prophylactic measures, annual calf losses being 13\u201320%. Although known in East Africa for a long time and may have originated there, it was recognized as a problem in southern Africa in 1904 only when it was imported with cattle from Dar es Salaam and spread wherever suitable tick hosts existed. Barnett and Brocklesby (1968) suggested T. parva was originally acquired from cattle as the buffalo and vector ticks existed in Central and South Africa together with cattle before 1904 without recognizable theileriasis in either cattle or buffalo. When introduced with cattle from East Africa it behaved like a disease that was new to the area. Koch (1898) found that cattle brought to the coast at Dar es Salaam fell ill indicating it was enzootic in the coastal area, and using ticks collected from sick cattle infected cattle at Kwai in the Usambaras, where the disease was unknown, with a mild viraemia (except for one already weak animal which died). Many of the ticks died in transit and Koch suggested the parasite may have lost its virulence. But Churchill (1908) claimed the disease came across the border into Kenya in 1905, thus the enzootic area does not seem to have extended northwards along the coast at that date. Theiler (1910) described its distribution as follows: \u201c\u2026certain places on the coast, then along the border of British East Africa around the Kilimandjoro, south of the Victoria Nyanza, in Huanza [Mwanza], and as far inland as Ruanda and Urundi behind the Victoria Nyanza, between this lake and Tanganyika, bordering the Kiwuland and the Belgian Congo;\u2026. on the northern border of the Nyassa, in the districts of Langenburg, and on several places south of the British East Africa border, and inland (Mangati)\u201d.",

Many wild animals host Theileria spp. and Grootenhuis (1979) considered there was not an eland in Kenya which did not carry theilerial piroplasms. But the main established link is between buffalo and cattle. As the eland piroplasms are T. mutans eland do not seem to be involved in transmission of ECF. Of those named, species have been assigned to bushbuck T. tragelaphi, kudu T. strepsicerosi, grey duiker T. sylvicaprae, Grant\u2019s gazelle T. stordyi, wildebeest T. gorgonis, and roan antelope T. hippotragi. Carmichael and Hobday (1975) found the theilerial piroplasms which cause ECF in all species they examined in northern Botswana but predominantly in buffalo (16.3%). One impala appeared pathologically affected and one kudu had a high level of parasitaemia. Theileria have been found in a number of antelopes elsewhere, but the incidence in buffalo was much lower than that recorded in buffalo in western Uganda (88%) or in South Africa\u2019s Kruger NP (97%). Buffalo can harbour T. lawrencei, T. mutans, and T. parva, together, although some consider T. lawrencei and T. parva may be synonymous but strains may vary in virulence.
