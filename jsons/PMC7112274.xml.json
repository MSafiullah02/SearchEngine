The provocative dose of methacholine producing a 15% decrease in transcutaneous oxygen pressure (PD15) was estimated from the dose-response curves fitted with a logistic function.

We previously demonstrated the ORMDL3 risk allele is associated with neonatal increased bronchial reactivity and increased risk of asthma in early childhood in our cohort.36 Together these characteristics are all typical of children at risk of asthma, supporting that children with acute severe bronchiolitis have a premorbid constitution, including bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which predisposes them to both an exaggerated response to respiratory tract viral infection and later development of asthma.",
