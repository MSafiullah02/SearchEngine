For example, sore throat can either be a disease in itself, or can result from other diseases, such as influenza and glandular fever.1, 2, 3, 4\n",

Colds are categorized as \u2018chills cold\u2019 or \u2018fever cold\u2019. Shigao (gypsum fibrosum) is used to abate fever; Caihu (bupleurum chinesenes DC) and Jinjie (herba schizonepetae) are used as analgesics; Banxia (rhizoma pinelliae) is dispensed to loosen sputum and suppress cough; Fangfeng (radix saposhnikiviae) and Zhishuye (folium perillae) are used for \u2018chill cough\u2019; Jinyinghua (flos lonicerae) and Bohe (herba menthae) for \u2018fever cough\u2019, and so on.

The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Chinese Ministry of Health General Office, issued a rule of combining Western and Chinese herbal medicine (ICWM) for this rapidly spreading disease. SARS was classified as a plague that needed to be treated in accordance with the \u2018wei, qi, ying, xue and sanjiao bianzheng lunzhi\u2019 theory. In keeping with this theory, some herbal medicinal extract injections to clear fever (qin re), remove dampness (qu shi), relieve asthma (zhi chuan), promote and regulate immunologic function (fu zheng), resist viruses and remove toxins (jie du), were recommended for clinical use.17\n",

In the reviews in which the reviewers subsequently contacted the authors, the percentage of authentic RCTs was 6.7% (23/342). This highlights the need for reviewers, including those doing Cochrane reviews, to use a strict method to identify whether the trial authors used the correct method to allocate participants when conducting a systematic review, and not just relying on published reports.

It was often necessary to include TCM signs as a secondary or an additional outcome in the trials. However, it is difficult to compare or quantify TCM signs as most of them are subjective or non-specific outcomes. For example, \u2018mai xiang\u2019 means pulse presentations. Diagnosing \u2018mai xiang\u2019 in TCM is a complex technique, dependent upon the TCM physician's feelings and experience. The descriptors \u2018marked improvement\u2019 and \u2018improvement\u2019 are commonly used to assess the change in TCM signs.
