            "text": "At the end of 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. As the epidemic continued to spread, it was listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [1], and China initiated a first-level response [2]. Due to the disease's high infectivity and pathogenicity and the high mortality rate of severely affected patients [3,4], nursing care of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is extremely difficult and requires high standards. Thus, The Chinese Government has proposed establishing a holistic nursing system for severe and critical patients to provide patient-centered care following modern nursing concepts, and utilizing nursing procedures as a fundamental framework and guide for clinical nursing care and nursing management. To standardize and guide holistic care of patients with COVID-19 in severe and critical condition and to effectively preserve their physical and mental health, an expert consensus panel on Holistic Care of COVID-19 Patients in Severe and Critical Condition (hereafter \u201cConsensus\u201d) was jointly developed, led by the Chinese Nursing Association, and involving the Nursing Department of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology), the Nursing Department of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and nursing experts dispatched by the Intensive Care Professional Committee of the Chinese Nursing Association to assist Wuhan.",

Oxygen supply cannot be interrupted arbitrarily during nasal high-flow oxygen therapy [10]. Employ lung protective approaches during invasive mechanical ventilation, and apply a small tidal volume (4\u20138 ml/kg of ideal weight) and low inspiratory pressure (plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O [1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa]) during the procedure to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury [5].(3)During administration of oxygen therapy, closely monitor patients' consciousness, heart rate, breathing characteristics (rhythm, rate, frequency, depth, synchronization of spontaneous breathing and ventilator), improvement of cyanosis, and oxygen therapy complications. Carefully monitor blood oxygen saturation or arterial blood gas analysis results [11] and promptly adjust oxygen flow rate, oxygen supply mode, and ventilator parameters accordingly, as per medical orders.(4)Ventilator and catheter care: (i) Passively humidify invasive ventilators using a heat-moisture-exchanger (HME) with a bacterial filter to reduce condensation in the circuit [12].(ii) Use of disposable ventilator circuits and exhalation valves is recommended, and installation of virus filters at both the inhalation and exhalation ends of the ventilator. Replace these filters only upon contamination or mechanical failure, as opposed to on a routine basis [12]. (iii) Do not disconnect the ventilator. If the ventilator must be disconnected, for reasons such as replacing the sealed sputum-aspirating tube, it must first be set to standby mode. (iv) Use 75% alcohol to wipe and disinfect the surface of the ventilator on a daily basis. Treat disposable catheters as infectious medical waste, and send reusable catheters to the disinfection center for sterilization after immersion for 30 min in a disinfectant containing 1,000\u20132,000 mg/L of chlorine-containing disinfectant.(5)Prone ventilation: Implementation of prone ventilation for more than 12 h per day can be considered when PaO2/FiO2 ratio is continuously lower than 150 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) [8]. (i) Prior to implementing prone ventilation, oropharyngeal and endotracheal secretions should be removed first to ensure an unobstructed artificial airway. (ii) Jejunal tube feeding is recommended for patients undergoing prone ventilation. If gastric tube feeding is employed, aspirate the patient's stomach contents before prone ventilation. When the patient is in the prone position, perform feeding in small amounts. (iii) Regularly evaluate and change the patient's prone position from side to side to avoid applying continuous pressure to the same area. Decompression dressings can be applied to pressured areas and the patient's apophysis area to reduce potential stressful skin damage.(6)Prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Keep the head of the bed elevated by 30\u201345\u00b0 [13]. Routinely monitor and maintain the cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube at 25\u201330 cmH2O. Promptly clear secretions accumulated under the glottis [14].\n",
