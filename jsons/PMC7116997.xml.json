Categorical variables were recorded by counts and percentages. Relationships among binominal variables were analysed using chi-squared testing or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Poisson regression was applied to calculate the relative rates (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for comparing contamination rates between doctors and nurses. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Data were entered and analysed using SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).",

There were two leading systems sources of contamination. The most common was lack of specific task assignment among rescuers (44%), i.e. a staff member was assigned two or more tasks across the clean and contaminated zones during the resuscitation. For example, if a staff member performing chest compressions moved on to record on the chart or retrieve medications from the trolley, contamination was registered. The other common source was inadequate preparation for procedures (42%), indicating that equipment for a specific task was not prepared and assembled beforehand so that the staff had to move back and forth between the clean and contaminated zones. For example, if during a procedure of intravenous catheterisation the nurse forgot to prepare the alcohol swab and went back and forth between patients and trolleys, contamination was registered. Further sources of contamination were classified as careless practice among HCWs (10%), for example leaving a patient's personal belongings on a trolley, or other causes (4%).",

Current concepts of infection control have evolved from universal precautions to detailed recommendations. \u2018Standard precautions\u2019 emphasise the potential mode and route of transmission, applying to all patients at all times; \u2018specific precautions\u2019 refer to patients with documented or suspected colonisation and infection with specific microorganisms.19, 20 Facing threats of tuberculosis, SARS, avian flu and other emerging infectious diseases, these recommendations remain valuable today. In fact, standard precautions involving use of simple PPE, including gloves, gowns, masks and eye protection, are effective in preventing serious contagious disease.6, 21 Lessons from the SARS epidemic indicated that poor compliance with the use of PPE,2, 21, 22, 23 and direct contact with a patient or an environment contaminated by respiratory droplets significantly increased the risk among HCWs of contracting SARS.2, 13, 24, 25\n",

Using bystander observations and a self-administered questionnaire, Henry found that gloves were the barrier device worn most frequently when appropriate (74%), followed by goggles (13%), gowns (12%) and masks (1%). In contrast, compliance with use of PPE was highest for masks (overall 90%) in our study. This is probably due to experience of the SARS outbreak.
