Although respiratory viruses are reported to be important causative agents of severe CAP [9], the prevalence of pure viral sepsis is not fully known. A recently published study investigated the role of virus detection by multiplex PCR of nasopharyngeal samples from clinically septic patients during a winter season [10]. The authors reported that respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were detected in 70% of adult patients with sepsis. In another study, Montull et al [11] investigated the predictors of severe sepsis in patients with CAP and found that 38% of patients presented with severe sepsis and that 0.5% were identified to have respiratory viruses as casual agents. The proportion of patients with pure viral sepsis was slightly higher in our study population, but we think that this was due to our use of the new Sepsis-3 definition. Montull et al also highlighted the association between older age and development of viral sepsis, which was in line with our finding that viral sepsis affected 64% of patients (88) aged \u226565 years. These results are consistent with data showing that, because of the increased prevalence of chronic conditions and age-related changes in the immune system, elderly patients are more susceptible to infectious diseases and sepsis. It is also possible that the endothelium is fragile in this population [12]. Male sex was another risk factor for pure viral sepsis, consistent with data that men typically have more chronic comorbidities and a higher incidence of CAP than women [13].",
