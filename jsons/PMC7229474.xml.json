Azgari et al. reported 84 women submitted to laparoscopic gynaecological surgery, randomized to receive SA plus sub-diaphragmatic lidocaine, SA alone or GA. Pain scores differences in the three groups assessed after surgery and the time of discharge were not statistically significant [26]. A recent series evaluated 80 women submitted to gynaecological laparoscopic surgery under LRA, randomized to receive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or intravenous Fentanyl to decrease intraoperative shoulder pain [27]; no differences in pain relief were found.",

Intra-abdominal pressures have to be maintained low, in order to reduce chest discomfort and shoulder pain due to the diaphragmatic irritation caused by pneumoperitoneum [28]. Trendelenburg positioning should be minimized. In cases requiring an increased intravenous sedation, the combined effect of LRA, pneumoperitoneum and intravenous drugs may lead to severe hypotension, hypoventilation and hypoxemia [29].

We included short operating time procedures under locoregional or general anaesthesia and we conducted a prospective cohort study, mimicking clinical decision-making in real-world contexts [30]. Strengths of our study include its prospective design and the sample size calculation. Our results, however, cannot be generalized because of the selective inclusion of women with benign adnexal conditions and the lack of randomization.
