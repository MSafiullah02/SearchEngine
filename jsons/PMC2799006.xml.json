The pEC50(1) and pEC50(2) of the dose response following incubation with CSF from vasospasm patients were significantly lower than non vasospasm indicating an increased sensitivity to ET1. Production of ET1 was significantly up-regulated in the arteries stimulated with CSF from vasospasm patients (1.87\u00b10.36 pg/ml) compared to vessels stimulated with CSF from patients without vasospasm or artificial CSF (0.88 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.83 \u00b1 0.17 pg/ml respectively; p<0.05).\n\n",

ALI was then induced by means of surfactant depletion until PaO2 \u2264 200 mmHg. The VT was then set at 6 ml/kg and RR increased to keep the PaCO2 lower than 55 mmHg. After stabilization, a recruitment maneuver was performed (50 cmH2O, 40 s). Thereafter, PEEP was set at 24 cmH2O and decreased to zero in steps of 4 cmH2O (10 min/step). At each step, arterial and mixed venous blood samples were obtained and cardiac output (CO) was measured. In six animals (CT-Group), whole lung helical CT-scans (1 mm thickness) were obtained at each step during end-expiratory and end-inspiratory pauses. Airway pressure and flow signals were recorded and elastance of the respiratory system (Ers), resistance (Rrs) and PEEP continuously computed by the least squares method. The best PEEP was then assessed considering four definitions: 1) PEEP of minimal Ers; 2) PEEP of minimal Ers and highest PaO2; 3) last PEEP with PaO2+PaCO2 \u2265 400 mmHg; 4) last PEEP before the PEEP of minimal Ers. Results are presented as median and inter-quartiles. Comparisons were performed with the Wilcoxon's test and adjusted with the Bonferroni-Holm procedure. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05.",

Fentanyl or morphine is commonly used to provide analgesia. However, both medications can promote adverse consequences, including hypotension, prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased ICU duration of stay and high costs. Comparative trials of both opioids have not been performed in critically ill patients and the selection of an agent depends on its pharmacology, adverse effects and costs. Many ICU physicians preferred fentanyl to morphine in hemodynamically unstable patients due to the risk of additional hypotension. However, both drugs accumulate and may cause similar adverse effects when continuously infused. The aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamic effects of morphine and fentanyl in hemodynamically unstable patients under mechanical ventilation.",

Some studies note an association of poor outcome with patients with high BP on hospital admission.

Therefore accurate measurement of blood pressure is crucial in the acute phase of stroke. Besides, the institution of suscessfuly treatments of blood pressure reduction or augmentation depends on it. Either non invasive or intraarterial blood pressure monitoring is commonly used in ICU. In different populations have been proved that non invasive method does not achieve right accuracy.

All cases with radiographic abnormalities had been technically difficult with a high index of clinical suspicion for injury. The prospective cohort studies from 2002\u20137 identified a total of 478 cases \u2212 218 cases had a mandatory post-procedure CXR (before the change in practice in 2006) and 260 with CXR only if clinically indicated. Of the mandatory post-procedure CXRs following routine PDT, there was no evidence of barotrauma or tube misposition. Following routine PDT the CXR altered management in only one case where a higher level of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) was used to treat radiographic atelectasis. From 2002\u20137 there were 2 cases of surgical emphysema with immediate clinical manifestation. Both cases required no specific treatment and had been difficult with multiple tracheal cannulations. CONCLUSION. We have studied a total of 699 PDTs over 11 years and after routine PDT no evidence of barotrauma or other problem requiring urgent intervention was identified on CXR. On one occasion the post-procedure CXR affected management, treating radiographic atelectasis, however derecruitment of bronchopulmonary segments is common after PDT and can be anticipated [2]. In uncomplicated, bronchoscopically guided PDT a routine postprocedure CXR is unnecessary in the absence of clinical deterioration. We recommend that a chest radiograph is mandatory in the following circumstances \u2014 anticipated postoperative complications secondary to technical difficulties, visualised tracheal damage or pre-procedure pneumothorax.",

Of the six women with a viable pregnancy, three had a fetal ultrasound when in ICU, five out of six had at least one cardiotocograph and one woman had no fetal assessment in ICU. None of the pregnant women gave birth during the ICU admission. Of the 25 postnatal women, 92% were admitted in the first 24 hours following birth. Four women saw their baby whilst in ICU, with the remaining women needing to wait until they were transferred out of ICU. An obstetric condition was the principle diagnosis for two thirds of women. However, pregnant and postnatal women were seen by 23 different types of medical specialties whilst in ICU. The mean number of specialties seen by individual women was 3.6 (median 4.0). 53% of women were seen by an obstetrician when in ICU: 100% of women with private health insurance (n=11) compared with only 29% of public patients (p<.05). Having the ICU and obstetric services on the one-site increased the chance of the woman being seen by an obstetrician, but did not guarantee it. Only 30% of the pregnant and postnatal women in ICU were seen by a midwife. Whether the woman was pregnant or postnatal did not affect her chance of being seen by an obstetrician or midwife in ICU. 70% (n=23) of women were transferred by ambulance between hospitals to access the ICU bed.",

The setting was a nursing school situated in a thousand bed general hospital. The participants were twenty-five trained nurses working in adult intensive care, neurosurgical, internal medical and recovery departments. The facilitators were the nurse tutor intensive care course and two nurses trained in group dynamics and with expertise in End of Life and ethics. Two six hour sessions were held. Use of a group dynamic allowed each nurse to express how they view EOL care in their own personal practice. This opening was followed by a group exercise using collage, an art therapy technique adapted to allow exploration of painful feelings on death and dying. By promoting self awareness into individual attitudes on death the caregiver is strengthened when caring for others. Theoritical knowledge was given next via frontal lectures on ethics, attitudes on EOL and law regarding the rights of the dying. The care of the grieving family was addressed using the Family Needs Inventory(CCFNI). Techniques of breaking bad news were discussed and theories of other disciplines such as Oncology were examined for models of palliative care that could be used in intensive care settings.",

RMs followed by inadequate PEEP permits unstable alveoli. The resulting cyclic recruitment/derecruitment during mechanical ventilation may contribute to ventilator associated lung injury (VALI) despite improved oxygenation. Results from a previous animal study suggest that total input reactance (Xrs) measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) at 5 Hz can be used to assess at the bedside the development of atelectasis and to monitor the efficacy of RM.

The introduction of Medical Emergency Teams (METs) in our hospital has led to a significant reduction in the mortality of risk patients. Data from several studies indicate that in a large number of cases, although patients met criteria for MET activation, that action was not performed. Several important barriers to staff calling for higher assistance have been identified. In the present study we tried to evaluate the occurrence of MET calls in patients who died during their hospitalization and their association with the presence of MET calling criteria in the 24 hours before death and the existence of a do not resuscitate (DNR) order.",

Cardiac and neurological toxicities, as well as increased vagal tone, are due to activation of voltage-dependent sodium channels. Cardiotoxicity consists in early and delayed afterdepolarisation. Indeed, during late repolarisation (phase 4 of the action potential) of the Purkinje cells, aconitine-attached Na channels open, allowing sodium influx and depolarization (\u201cdelayed afterdepolarization\u201d). This results in increased automaticity (premature ventricular beats). During late phase 2 or early phase 3 (repolarisation), aconitine-induced Na accumulation induces depolarization (\u201cearly afterdepolarisation\u201d). This results in long QT interval with a risk of torsades de pointes. Antiarrhythmic agents have inconstant results in aconite intoxication. Especially amiodarone could promote torsades de pointes. The effects of magnesium sulfate on aconitine-induced ventricular arrhythmias have been studied in animal models (1). In contrast to other antiarrhythmic agents, it abolishes early afterdepolarisation and shortens the prolonged duration of the Purkinje cell action potential.",
