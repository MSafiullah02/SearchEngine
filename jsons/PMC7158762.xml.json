Scientists have not yet been able to identify the animal source of the infectious agent and have not determined whether a persistent animal reservoir of the infectious agent exists. It is also unclear whether SARS, like influenza, is a seasonal disease that would have receded on its own. It remains to be seen whether it will reemerge on a seasonal basis, and if so, how virulent future manifestations would be. The answers to these questions would undoubtedly advance the world's ability to predict and prepare for a resurgence of COVID-19.",
