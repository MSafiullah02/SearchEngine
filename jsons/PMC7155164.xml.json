This process from raw materials to end consumer looks very different today than just 30 years ago. Today, a typical supply network spans across multiple continents, often operating on 24-hour continuous cycles, all the while intermingling natural, social, economic, and geo-political environments into one cohesive operation. Given just how interconnected modern supply networks are, it is no surprise that these supply networks are at a heightened risk of disruption. Various events across the globe impact the firm\u2019s ability to effectively match its supply with the demand. More recently, we can see clear examples of these risks leading to disruptions in the network such as attacks on oil supply (Turak and Ellyatt, 2019), the implementation of tariffs (Wursthorn, 2019), the call for labor strikes (Ip, 2019), and even the discovery of important social issues such as human rights violations (Smith, 2019). Taken together, it is clear that when firms design their supply networks, they need to be mindful not only of the potential risks to which their supply chains are susceptible, but also how these risks propagate throughout these complex and highly integrated networks.",

For over 60 years, the newsvendor model has been the bedrock of the design of various inventory policy and systems. Despite the thousands of papers that have been written on the matter, few have attempted to address a pressing concern in modern inventory systems: the presence of the ripple effect (Ivanov et al., 2014, Hosseini et al., 2019b). The ripple effect is defined as the spread of disruption and the resulting impact on performance throughout a supply network (Ivanov, 2017). While it is similar to the bullwhip effect, the ripple effect is often characterized by low-frequency/high-impact events, a lasting impact on supply chain performance, as well as permanent and temporary structural changes to the network (Ivanov et al., 2017a). Put simply, the ripple effect is a propagation of disruption throughout a supply network.",

A supply chain disruption is any event that prevents the supply chain from operating at it\u2019s normal or expected state (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005). On the other hand, a supply chain risk is any event that can manifest into a disruption (DuHadway et al., 2018).

While supply chain risk may not inherently result in a cost or loss of some nature, it can lead to a disruptive event that will.",

The ripple effect (i.e. disruption propagation) results from a sequence of known events based on the structural design of the supply chain (Ivanov et al., 2014), which is a phenomena that can be objectively studied given that the view of structure is often objectively measured. Contrast this with risk propagation, where supply chain risk is viewed in the eye of the beholder through a \u201csense-making\u201d process (Ellis et al., 2011). Risk propagation would therefore be dependent on not only the structural characteristics of the supply network, but also how the supply chain manager views and measures \u201crisk\u201d.",

Such work advocated for the need to adequately classify and measure risk, as well as understand it\u2019s antecedents and consequences (Peck, 2005). One proposed method for characterizing supply chain disruption was the construct of supply chain severity. Supply chain severity is defined as the number of nodes, locations, or events that are impacted as a result of a supply chain disruption (Craighead et al., 2007). This early work laid the foundation for the literature on the concept of propagation, generally. However, despite the suggestion of multiple frameworks to incorporate the idea of propagation, few have focused on the concept of severity from the lens of risk and risk propagation.",

First, supply chain risk management is an inherently subjective process, since what one may consider \u201crisky\u201d, another may not. This is due to the firm\u2019s perception of the environment within which they operate (Ellis et al., 2011, DuHadway et al., 2018, DuHadway and Carnovale, 2019). It can equally be argued that \u201crisk\u201d is measured in various ways, many of which are dependent on the decision maker\u2019s preferences and perceptions (Garvey et al., 2015, Zsidisin and Ritchie, 2009). While one may view the minimization of \u201crisk\u201d by minimizing expected cost, another may prefer to instead minimize total spread of risk (i.e. severity). This is simply a matter of preference. A second reason why supply chain risk severity is an important consideration to be studied, is because of the potential financial consequences that the total spread of disruption may have on the focal firm as well as the supply chain (Craighead et al., 2007).",

Next, we describe our \u201cRippled Newsvendor\u201d model by first showing how supply chain severity can be analytically modeled leveraging concepts from Bayesian Networks, Models of The Ripple Effect, and Supply Chain Risk Propagation. We then conduct three numerical experiments by simulating various risk structures in a simple linear supply chain so as to implement and approximate, as well as better understand, the \u201cRippled Newsvendor\u201d model.

In other words, it is any event that prevents the supply chain from operating at an expected or planned state. Due to the proliferation of global sourcing and the level of perceived importance from practitioners (Craighead et al., 2007), academics have given special attention to understanding the various ontologies and methods of analysis to study SCDs. The extant literature on the matter has found that SCDs have a significant impact on a firm\u2019s manufacturing and inventory performance (Tomlin, 2006). As such, some have proposed a general managerial process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating against supply chain disruptions (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005). Some of the proposed frameworks for designing mitigation strategies include (but are not limited to) the use of primary suppliers, pre-positioned warehouses, or dual sourcing (Yang et al., 2012). In addition, there have been many attempts to optimize decision making within supply chain risk management (SCRM) and SCD management via analytical models (Saghafian and Van Oyen, 2016).",

There is, however, much debate over a precise definition of \u201csupply chain risk\u201d. Some authors characterize it in terms of a consequence (Hendricks and Singhal, 2005), whereas others characterize it as a likelihood (Garvey et al., 2015), although these two dimensions are often used together to measure risk (Tang and Tomlin, 2008). Regardless of their definition, SCRs have been shown to have impacts on firm performance, contingent on detection efforts, perception, and implemented mitigation strategies (Garvey et al., 2015, Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005, Zsidisin and Wagner, 2010). The extant literature views Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) as both a strategic (Chopra and Sodhi, 2004) and tactical (Ho et al., 2015) activity, which lies at the intersection of Supply Chain Management and Risk Management (Khojasteh-Ghamari and Irohara, 2018). Furthermore, many have proposed managerial frameworks that include several dimensions and related concepts, including assessment, measurement (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005), mitigation strategies (Tang and Tomlin, 2008), risk classification (Ho et al., 2015), as well as drivers and consequences due to various firm characteristics and decisions (Ang et al., 2016).",

Early work in supply chain disruptions suggested how to model the events beyond the horizon of the focal firm (Craighead et al., 2007). For example, [36] proposed a model to study supplier selection in centralized and decentralized supply chain systems. [48] studied the resilience of supply networks under disruptions at multiple echelons in the network. The idea of interconnections between events was proposed by [2], who suggested the use of Petri-Nets in a reachability analysis to determine which specific areas of the network can be affected by a supply chain disruption.",

Through a series of papers, the ripple effect has been studied with respect to several decisions, measurements, analysis methods, and phenomena, including but not limited to distribution (Ivanov et al., 2015), recovery and resilience (Ivanov et al., 2016), performance measurement (Sokolov et al., 2016), reverse logistics (Ivanov et al., 2017b), and simulation methods (Ivanov, 2017). The common element in this body of work has been how one element on the supply chain is \u201cconnected\u201d to another element of the supply chain. For example, [19] used dynamic Bayesian networks with integrated Markov chains to study and quantify the ripple effect. Extending off of this notion, research has also uncovered optimal strategies for supplier selection and optimal order allocation (Hosseini et al., 2019c). Recent work has also incorporated disruption and recovery considerations into supply chain risk assessments using the ripple effect, developing new measures to identify high-risk suppliers (Hosseini and Ivanov, 2019). The concept of disruption in this literature is not isolated to study at a single location, but rather, to multiple locations and firms; primarily driven by the structure of the network (Hosseini et al., 2019a).",

Unlike disruption propagation, where the potential sequence of disruption is solely dependent on the structure of the supply network, risk propagation is more general and describes non-structural as well as structural related events that can lead to disruptions, ripple effects, or other risk propagations. Risk propagation is the sequence of inter-dependent risks in the supply network which may or may not lead to a disruption or ripple effect. Risk propagation is often modeled using conditional probability theory (Garvey et al., 2015) by trying to ascertain which events within and outside the firm will lead to a disruption (such as weather, labor strikes, tariffs, etc.).

A similar methodology was also proposed by [43] but for the study of supply chain resilience. Risk propagation has also emerged within analytical models such as facility location (Luo and Chen, 2017). Furthermore, the reverse flow of risk (from downstream to upstream) has been explored from a variation in payment perspective (Serrano et al., 2018).

Bayesianism rests on the general principle that probability is inherently a subjective belief regarding an event that one holds, measured on a 0 to 1 scale (0 being not likely, 1 being certain). The idea is that every individual has a collection of observations and concepts often referred to as knowledge. This knowledge, often represented as \u03be, represents all the beliefs that one has about the world surrounding them, and is often referred to as a priori knowledge, or prior belief (Heckerman, 1998). This is commonly modeled with the use of conditional probability. Conditional probability transcends the concept of belief updating. For example, if X represents the amount of income we will earn next year, then an individual initially holds a belief that X will be equal to a with a value of belief P(X=a\u2223\u03be). When an individual observes a new event e, say, such as a new boss entering the company, this belief is then updated to a posterior belief, namely P(X=a\u2223\u03be,e). To compute this, the standard definition of conditional probability is often employed: P(X=a\u2223\u03be,e)=P(X=a,\u03be,e)P(\u03be,e)\n",

A Bayesian Network is essentially a cause and effect diagram with no circular causality. This is one reason why the resulting network must be acyclic. If we had a directed cycle, the notion of endogeneity would enter into our model of dependency, which would cause problems of inference. That is, we essentially would have a chicken and egg problem (i.e. which came first?).",

Constructing this network is known as specifying the structure of the dependency model.

If a node in the network has n parents, then the number of conditional distributions we must assign to the random variable is 2n (assuming all the variables are binary). Once the structure and conditional probabilities have been specified (either by definition or estimated from data), the resulting Bayesian Network is said to have been specified. Once this is complete, the network can then be used for probabilistic inference by leveraging Bayes Theorem as well as the Expansion Rule for Probability. However, as the size of the network grows, exact probabilistic inference becomes NP-HARD (Pearl, 2014, Heckerman, 1998). Hence, inference in practical application tends to be conducted using simulation methods (Garvey et al., 2015). While it is outside the scope of this manuscript to provide a comprehensive review of the theory of Bayesian networks, we refer the reader to (Heckerman, 1998) for an in-depth treatment of the subject.",

However, looking at only paths, rather than general scenarios, ignores situations where two simultaneous disruptions occur, one indirectly dependent on the other, that a typical path model cannot capture. For example, if we have three firms such that A\u2192B\u2192C, many BN models assume that the disruption scenario of Disruption\u2212NoDisruption\u2212Disruption is impossible, since the disruption was assumed to be stopped and cannot continue to progress from B to C. However, this is myopic, since this can occur in practice due to either a limitation of knowledge (firm B assumes that C will not self-disrupt, and does not have knowledge of the disruption at A) or due to pure coincidence. In addition, much of the extant literature assumes that Bayesian Networks only comprise of two states, scilicet \u201coccurred\u201d and \u201cnot occurred\u201d. However, the [13] allows for the possibility of a third state, namely that of \u201cunknown\u201d, which is more natural to the inherent model of Bayesian Networks. Last, the [13] model provides a clear and unambiguous algorithm for constructing the structure of the Bayesian Network, where other models do not. The construction of the network is based on the structure of the supply network itself, which makes the modelling process more realistic and easier to construct.",

The risk graph is a Bayesian Network that is constructed under a set of assumptions using the structure of the supply network itself and fusing it together with the variety of supply chain risks that are present within each element of the network (either within a node or within a link). They argue that it is illogical to presume that risk \u201cflows\u201d directly from one risk in a location to another risk in a different location where there is no direct connection between the locations, despite the fact that the parameters in the Bayesian Network allow for such an instance. Put differently, their assumption allows for the simplification of modelling the inter-dependency of risks, while allowing for the possibility of risk to flow through non-disrupted events, which allows for the capture of more realistic scenarios without the additional burden of data or computation.",

We assume this is the same for all firms in the chain for all of their exogenous events. If we have inventory disrupted (V1=1), then the probability of this impacting the demand is based on either the exogenous event impacting all of the demand, or, it does not impact demand but there is insufficient production to satisfy demand. Put differently, the demand cannot be fulfilled if the exogenous event \u201ctrickled down\u201d to the demand fulfillment, or if D>P1.

First, production can be impacted, based on our assumptions, by an exogenous event (E1), the disruption in production of the firm\u2019s supplier (R2), or disruption in inventory of the firm\u2019s supplier (V2). Hence, the parents for the risk of disruption to production in firm f1 would be E1, R2, and V2. Notice, however, that these are similar risks to what we studied in our previous conditional probability table. Therefore, we can apply much of the same logic here as we did there so as to obtain the following CPT, with some slight alterations. First, since the decision variables are known, we have no need for a probability distribution on them. However, the outcome of a disruption manifesting as a result of insufficient production or inventory is easier to characterize with an indicator function to indicate if a disruption \u201ctrickles down\u201d as a result of insufficient supply. This happens when demand/order quantity is larger than total supply. Hence, we will let g(x1,x2,x3)=1x1>x2+x30 otherwise Using this, we know then that production is disrupted (R1=1) when there is something inherent within production that \u201cgoes wrong\u201d. We assumed that the probability of this occurring is dependent on the amount of which is produced. Hence, we will let pr(P1) denote the probability of an endogenous disruption to production as a result of producing P1 units. We assume that this function is linear, and we characterize it using the equation pr(P1)=ar+brP1. Here, ar represents a \u201cwear and tear\u201d constant, and it denotes the probability of the machine failing if we produce nothing. This constant takes into consideration all of the wear and tear from previous runs before the current time-period. The constant br is the marginal probability of decay. Put differently, it represents the increase in probability of the machine breaking down as a result of producing one additional unit.",

Also, we can experience a disruption in production at f1 if production and inventory of f2 does not meet f1\u2019s order quantity (P1>P2+I2). In the case of production when an exogenous event manifests, production can be disrupted due to three reasons: (1) the exogenous event led to the machine to break down, (2) the production quantity led to the machine to break down, or (3) the production and inventory were insufficient to cover the order quantity. Using a similar reasoning as with our disruption to delivery to the final consumer, and using our activation function together with the probabilities formed above, we can form the following conditional probability table:",

We ran the genetic algorithm with varying parameters, and found other solutions with similar fitness values to confirm our first run of the algorithm. We used this point in the solution space as a reference so that we can visualize the objective function. We next leveraged the ployly package to render 6 plots, which are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 2, Fig. 2, Fig. 2, Fig. 2, Fig. 2, Fig. 2. The plots involved the risk severity plotted against P1\u00d7I, P2\u00d7I, P3\u00d7I, P1\u00d7P2, P1\u00d7P3, P2\u00d7P3 over the range of [0,200] on integers. Given the complexity in computation of each point for our objective function, computing the objective function of the points to plot took approximately 10 h.",

First, for each model generated in Experiment 2, we kept all decisions and parameters fixed at the optimal value as determined by the genetic algorithm. For each parameter, we computed its value at a certain percentage above and below the original value of the parameter. To do so, we generated a vector of percentages, ranging by every 5%, from \u2212100% to 100%. Each new value of the chosen parameter was then generated by multiplying a factor (which was the percentage plus 1) by the value of that parameter at the optimal solution.

This should be expected due to the construction of our model, as well as involving the trade-off between disrupting due to not ordering enough, and disrupting due to over-production. The plots convey the idea that when ordering quantities are too high, or if inventory quantities are too high, the risk severity is higher. This is due to our assumption of increased probability of disruption in production or inventory as these quantities rise. We also can observe that if too little is ordered, across the plots, the severity also increases. This is due to the assumption that when demand exceeds total supply, a disruption, by definition, occurs. The apparent convexity properties in our objective function mirror those of more traditional newsvendor models that observe the trade-offs between underage and overage costs (Ray and Jenamani, 2016a).",

We also notice that severity is lower when firms produce more than what is ordered, but not too much so as to lead to a disruption in production. The shape of the objective function, however, differs for decisions mixed with inventory rather than those with production. We notice that in the plots with production and inventory, there is a trade-off (higher production necessitates lower inventory, and vice versa). While in the plots with only production between the firms, we notice that such a trade-off has less of an effect on the severity. Overall, however, the biggest take-away from our plots is the convex nature of the objective function, which may indicate that optimal solutions do exist for our model, and reflect the trade-off between producing too little or too much so as to minimize severity.",

Rather, there is a distinction of magnitude of impact based on whether the risk had manifested within a firm\u2019s boundaries (yet, the risk itself still being considered as \u201cexogenous\u201d) or from outside.

We further emphasize the reasoning for this with two primary explanations with respect to our study. First, the structure of the supply chain is itself linear, and so the number of \u201cpaths\u201d for risk to \u201cflow\u201d is greatly reduced in our risk graph than if we were to have a more complex network.

This result also further emphasizes the importance to theoretically distinguish between risk propagation (i.e. severity) and risk. With risk propagation, we have confirmed the findings of other studies that suggest simpler structures lead to decreased risk propagation (Craighead et al., 2007, Schmitt et al., 2017). On the other hand, some in the traditional risk literature have suggested that supply chain risk (not propagation) is related to the complexity of the network in a positive curvilinear manner (Choi and Krause, 2006). Put simply, complexity impacts risk differently than it impacts risk propagation, which further underscores the importance of distinguishing between these constructs.",

However, interestingly enough, despite all parameters remaining constant, an increase in average demand leads to an increase in risk severity. The reason, however, is fairly straightforward. Since the average demand is higher, we will need to either produce more, or, hold more in inventory. This underscores the importance of proper capacity management and management of the aforementioned trade-offs. These results are also consistent with more traditional profit-based newsvendor models (Khouja, 1999).",

The production of the lowest firm in our model were the least sensitive, while the inventory was the most sensitive. However, this can be explained due to our simplifying assumption of equal inventories across all firms. With respect to the probabilities of disruption, we can see that the probability of the manifestation of an exogenous event at a firm when no exogenous event has manifested at the firm\u2019s supplier is the most sensitive of our parameters. This is in line with our earlier observation of this probability having the most impact on the optimal severity in the network. Furthermore, we can observe that the probability of the manifestation of an exogenous event at a firm when an exogenous event has manifested at the firm\u2019s supplier is the least sensitive of the parameters in our model. Interestingly enough, of the production decisions, we notice that the production of firm 2 tends to be the most sensitive.",

Furthermore, some in the literature have suggested that when a disruption occurs, it has a natural tendency to trickle down and throughout a supply network, an event which is often referred to as the ripple effect. Our model can be considered an extension of this idea. More appropriately, the Rippled Newsvendor can be viewed as the precursor to various ripple effects, and how the presence of various risks eventually lead to the disruption propagation itself. Hence, our research also illustrates the need to theoretically distinguish between disruption propagations such as the ripple effect, and risk propagations, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak (Ivanov, 2020), which could eventually lead to a ripple effect.",

At a general level, our findings lead to a better understanding of how not only inventory and production policies should be structured when the objective is severity-based, but also which portions of the supply network (with respect to disruption risk) should be given the most attention and mitigation efforts. Additionally, managers need to have the appropriate management of exogenous events. This of course has been emphasized in the prior literature through proper risk management methodologies, namely that of identification, assessment, and mitigation (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005), or the detection, mitigation, recovery viewpoint (DuHadway et al., 2019, DuHadway and Carnovale, 2019). Our results, however, indicate that managers should focus more of their attention on control or mitigation of exogenous events that directly impact their own firm, and spend less of an effort and resources on mitigating the propagation of exogenous risk from a supplier to an exogenous risk of the firm itself.",

Last, if the firm is in a linear structure (which we contend is not a very realistic assumption), they should aim to contract with suppliers that have longer chains. This may seem counter intuitive, since longer chains may expose the firm to more susceptibility of risk. However, our results indicate that when the firm has a single supplier, and suppliers subsequent to them also have single suppliers, when the chain is longer, the average severity is lower. The reasoning behind this observation is simple. Chains can stop disruptions in their path due to the simplicity of the structure, while networks allow for other paths for the disruption to propagate (Kim et al., 2011). If the supply chain structure is a pure linear structure, and one of the firms exposed to the risk managed to mitigate it, it is less likely for the disruption to continue downstream. The only other way in which a disruption can occur in a firm lower than the firm that mitigated the disruption would be due to (1) pure coincidence or (2) due to some unknown path of causality, as we argued above.",

Future research is needed to understand how multiple suppliers, as well as how general network structure, will impact optimal decision making with respect to minimizing risk severity. Second, while we focused on risk severity, we did not include any profit or budgetary constraints. Future research will need to re-examine our model from either a constrained budget lens, or, a multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, we assume that all firms have the same inventory levels with varying production levels. While this was an initial consideration, we decided that varying both the inventory levels and production levels across all firms would add unnecessary complexity and would be outside the scope of this study. Future research should examine this limitation. Furthermore, we assumed that the probabilities of exogenous events were all the same across all firms. This of course is a threat to the external validity of our results. Future research will need to better understand how the Rippled Newsvendor is to respond when the probabilities of exogenous events differ across firms. Last, our model only was studied from a single-period perspective. The decision for us to do so was mainly motivated by the design of the original newsvendor model and to restrict our attention as to how the risk structure impacts the severity.

However, how would our model change when the manager\u2019s preference is to craft policy based on expected cost of disruption rather than number of events? Even if we were to remain in the severity framework of study, another important consideration to take into account is the manager\u2019s risk preference and response (DuHadway et al., 2018). Some events that manifest may not be as grave of a concern as others. Furthermore, our study only relies on measures of averages without taking into account variation. While the optimal policies characterized herein portend great concern over certain parameters, how would this change when the manager has the competing objective to minimize the variance of the number of events? Future research is required to answer this question. Additionally, future studies could address an extension of the Rippled Newsvendor from a mean\u2013variance perspective.",

We argue that these questions merit further investigation for future research. None-the-less, we argue that the Rippled Newsvendor Model is a natural transcendence of operations and supply chain modeling into a modern era of complex networks. While more antiquated inventory models may be appropriate for firms that operate in a more traditional inventory system, we argue that the Rippled Newsvendor model is an appropriate first step in studying systems in our new, complex, and highly adaptable world of supply chain network structures.",
