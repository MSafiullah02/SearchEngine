Commuted topography has been the most widely recommended and used imaging modality for screening thus far [2], however it has significant downsides including the need of extensive sterilization of equipment after use with highly contagious COVID-19 virus, along with cost and excessive radiation. Lung ultrasound has been previously established as an excellent method of diagnosing and monitoring pneumonia and ARDS, particularly when compared to chest xray [3, 4] , and thus has potential as a cheap and effective imaging modality in the early diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19.",

Huang et al showed in a small preliminary study that 75% of observed patients with COVID-19 had identifiable lesions in the bilateral lower lobes [5] . This study examined twenty patients with noncritical illness using 3-17 MHz high frequency linear array to characterize lung lesions and identified a few identifying characteristics: a numerous bilateral b-lines, subpleural pulmonary consolidations, and poor blood flow. These findings were highly consistent with finding on CT. In addition, they determined that COVID-19 subpleural lesions differed significantly from similar ones seen in bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, tuberculosis, atelectasis, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema [5] . An example of which being that B-lines in COVID-19 appear to be more fixed, fused, and obtuse compared to cardiogenic pulmonary edema [5] . Peng et al also examined twenty patients with COVID-19 using lung ultrasound and described similar characteristic findings that typically appeared in a multilobar distribution: focal B-lines were the main feature early on followed by alveolar interstitial syndrome in progressive stages, then lastly A-lines during convalescence [6] . Pleural effusions were rarely seen at any stage [6] . A third preliminary study performed by Poggiali et al evaluated twelve patients whom presented with symptomatic COVID-19 using US and CT. They reported good consistency between b-lines on US and ground glass opacities on CT in all twelve patients, with both modalities identifying organizing pneumonia in four of those patients [7] .",

Although CT is still considered the preferred imaging modality, ultrasound may be useful in evaluating for early lung changes in emergency room patients suspected of having the novel virus or monitoring progression of confirmed cases. In resource limited settings, ultrasound could theoretically be applied as a triaging tool where patients with identified lesions are prioritized for CT imaging, with hopes of reducing the number of contagious patients entering the scanner. There is still an obvious need for more clinical evidence before definitive conclusions can be made, however that should not stop clinicians from utilizing ultrasound early on during this pandemic.",
