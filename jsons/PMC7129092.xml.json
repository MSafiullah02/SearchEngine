            "text": "While the capability of viruses to infect and injure cardiovascular tissue is well established, a causal association between viral infection and myocardial cell injury has been difficult to prove, and the diagnosis of viral myocarditis is often elusive. Accordingly, an animal model of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy could be useful to explore relationships between myocardial inflammation and myocardial injury. The domestic cat provides a model of spontaneous cardiomyopathy whose histopathologic features include myocyte injury, necrosis, and in some cases, myocarditis 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Feline cardiomyopathy is characterized by myocardial dysfunction and structural derangement and is an important cause of arrhythmias, heart failure, and death 1, 2, 3, 6, 7. The etiology of feline cardiomyopathy is typically unknown although taurine deficiency has been associated with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and some cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been demonstrated to be familial 8, 9. While a relationship between viral myocarditis and feline myocardial disease has been suspected 1, 2, the pathogenesis is usually unknown, and these disorders have been diagnosed as idiopathic cardiomyopathy, by definition a heart muscle disease of unknown etiology. Recently, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to amplify viral genetic material and allow identification of minute amounts of target DNA 10, 11, 12. Since viral myocarditis has been implicated in chronic myocardial injury and dysfunction 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, PCR could potentially be used to identify viral infection in this model of feline cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate archival myocardial tissues for cardiomyopathy and histopathologic lesions of myocarditis and use PCR to detect viral genome in hearts from these animals.",

In 4 cats inflammatory infiltrates were diffuse and were present confluently between endocardial or epicardium and subjacent myocardium. Inflammatory cells were characterized as predominantly mild lymphocytic infiltration with occasional plasmacytes or neutrophils in 15 cats (Figure 2\n, top), and by predominantly mild to moderate neutrophilic infiltration with occasional lymphocytes and plasma cells in 3 cats (Figure 2, bottom).

While histopathologic myocardial lesions have been reported only rarely from cats infected with panleukopenia virus 56, 57, 58, our data suggests that this virus has substantial cardiotropic activity in cats. Neither herpes, calici, nor corona virus genome was detected in any of the cardiac tissues. Although herpes virus myocarditis has been reported in humans and canines 10, 59, it is possible that herpes virus, as well as corona and calici virus are non-cardiotropic in the cat. Technical factors in PCR could have limited our ability to detect viral myocardial infection, but since PCR consistently amplified positive controls from cell cultures, this would seem unlikely. It is conceivable that cats with cardiomyopathy were infected by viral strains, which were substantially different from our primer sequences and positive control, and therefore, could not be amplified using our methodologies. However, primers were carefully selected from conserved regions of the virus, and would be expected to be consistent between strains. Sample selection or handling can affect the ability to detect myocarditis 13, 53, 54. We sampled multiple regions of myocardium to improve sampling efficacy. Nevertheless, focal regions of infection may have been missed. Although successful PCR amplification of viral genome from long-term formalin fixed biopsy tissues have been reported 10, 11, nucleic acid degradation over time may have negatively influenced PCR because archival samples were maintained in buffered formalin until time of analysis.",
