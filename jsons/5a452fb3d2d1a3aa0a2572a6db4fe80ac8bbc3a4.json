Piperacillin-tazobactam is a frequently used therapy in critically ill patients with pulmonary infection. Antibiotic concentrations in the lung reflect target-site antibiotic concentrations in patients with pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the plasma and intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of piperacillin-tazobactam in critically ill patients administered standard piperacillin-tazobactam regimens. A population PK model was developed to describe plasma and intrapulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations. The probability of piperacillin exposures reaching pharmacodynamic end points and the impact of pulmonary permeability on piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration was explored. The median piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration ratios were 49.3 and 121.2%, respectively. Pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations were unpredictable and negatively correlated with pulmonary permeability. Current piperacillin-tazobactam regimens may be insufficient to treat pneumonia caused by piperacillin-tazobactam-susceptible organisms in some critically ill patients.",

This is partly due to marked pharmacokinetic (PK) variability occurring in critically ill patients. 7 The PK of critically ill patients may be affected by physiological changes associated with illness, which typically result in a higher proportion of patients receiving suboptimal drug exposure when a fixed regimen is used. [7] [8] [9] In addition, many currently licensed drug regimens are informed by studies performed in non-critically ill patients, and may not necessarily be appropriate outside that context.",

Piperacillin-tazobactam has a broad spectrum of action that includes Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. 10 Consequently, piperacillin-tazobactam is a common choice for both directed and empirical treatment of critically ill patients. 11 The pharmacodynamic index that best links piperacillin concentrations with its antimicrobial effect is the fraction of the dosing interval that unbound piperacillin concentrations are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). 12 Near-maximal antimicrobial effect is generally observed when free piperacillin concentrations exceed the MIC for at least 50% of the dosing interval (50% fT <MIC ). 13 However, 100% fT <MIC may be more appropriate for critically ill patients. 14 The global increase in the incidence of antimicrobial resistance has focused attention on antimicrobial drug regimens that are safe and effective, and that also minimize the probability of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. 15 We recently used a hollow fiber infection model of piperacillin-tazobactam vs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa to demonstrate that a trough (C min ) total piperacillin concentration-to-MIC ratio of between 3 and 10 prevents the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. 16 Identification of piperacillin-tazobactam regimens that enable the attainment of pharmacodynamic targets for both efficacy and suppression of emergence of antimicrobial resistance may lead to improved clinical outcomes and increase the clinical longevity of this commonly used agent.",

Healthy volunteer data suggest that the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in ELF is \u224825% and \u224850% of the plasma piperacillin and tazobactam AUCs, respectively. 21 Although there is a general paucity of information regarding ELF penetration of antimicrobial agents in critically ill patients, two studies suggest that piperacillin and tazobactam ELF concentrations are \u224850% and 65-90% of their respective paired plasma concentrations. 22, 23 The primary aim of this clinical study was to quantify the pulmonary penetration of piperacillin and tazobactam in critically ill patients. We also investigated factors that may influence the penetration of drug into the lung. A PK pharmacokinetic model was used to describe the observed plasma and ELF concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam in critically ill patients (Supplementary Table S1 online). Monte Carlo simulation was used to explore the impact of pharmacokinetic variability on plasma and ELF piperacillin exposures to achieve the desired pharmacodynamic target. In addition, the influence of pulmonary permeability on pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations was investigated.",

            "text": "Inspection of the concentration-time profiles for both piperacillin and tazobactam illustrates marked PK variability in critically ill patients (Figure 2) . The PK variability is notably more evident in the lung as compared with plasma for both compounds. The estimates of clearance and volume of the central compartment from the population PK model are consistent with previously published values. 9, 27, 28 The validity and generalizability of our results are further suggested by the concordance of simulated concentrations from the population PK model with data from a previously published group of critically ill patients (see Figure 1 ). 22 \u03b2-Lactam antibiotics penetrate the lung by passive diffusion. 18, 29 Diffusion into tissues is dependent on the concentration gradient across biological membranes, the surface area of the membrane, and a diffusion coefficent. 30 The diffusion coefficient is principally influenced by the physicochemical characteristics of the drug (e.g., the degree of lipophilicity) and the extent of protein binding. 31, 32 There was a positive correlation between plasma and ELF exposures for both piperacillin and tazobactam. However, these relationships did not reach statistical significance, which is unexpected and perhaps due to the modest number of patients in the study. In this study we used the ratio of total protein in ELF to plasma as a surrogate measure of lung permeability. 33 We expected to see an increase in the diffusion of drug with an increasing pulmonary protein penetration. However, we observed a statistically significant negative correlation between the piperacillin pulmonary penetration ratio (AUC ELF /AUC unbound plasma ) and pulmonary permeability ( Figure 5) . As pulmonary permeability increased, there was a reduction in the relative proportion of piperacillin penetrating the lung. For tazobactam, there was no statistically significant correlation between the pulmonary penetration ratio (AUC ELF / AUC unbound plasma ) and pulmonary permeability. The relationship between pulmonary permeability and pulmonary drug concentration has not previously been investigated for \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Pulmonary vancomycin penetration has been shown to be higher in patients with increased pulmonary permeability as measured by ELF albumin concentration. 34 Lung penetration of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics has been shown to be dependent on plasma albumin concentration. 31, 35, 36 Increased tissue penetration occurs when higher unbound plasma \u03b2-lactam antibiotic concentrations are observed in patients with hypoalbuminemia. This phenomenon primarily affects highly protein bound agents such as ertapenem and flucloxacillin. 31, 35, 36 There are a number of potential explanations for the relationship between piperacillin lung penetration and permeability. Methodologically, this is a small study with extreme PK variability in both the observed plasma and ELF drug concentrations. Multiplication of the measured pulmonary sample concentration by a dilution factor, derived from a comparison of urea concentrations in plasma and pulmonary samples, 37,38 may contribute to the greater variability observed in the pulmonary drug concentrations as compared with plasma concentrations. A possible biological explanation includes dilution of intrapulmonary piperacillin due to larger ELF volumes that are associated with increasing pulmonary permeability. Alternatively, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are substrates for organic anion transporters in other organs, such as the kidney. 39 Disruption of an active transport system may occur in the injured lungs of critically ill patients, which exhibit increased permeability to protein. Another explanation may be that an increase in pulmonary protein permeability preferentially affects diffusion of piperacillin and tazobactam into and out of the lung. Therefore, in lungs with low protein permeability, piperacillin diffuses into the lung faster than it diffuses out. The reverse occurs in lungs with higher protein permeability. Validation of the negative correlation of pulmonary piperacillin penetration and pulmonary permeability is required in a similar clinical cohort.",

The probabilities of achieving the same pharmacodynamic targets increase to 86 and 82% for plasma and ELF, respectively, when the MIC is known and organisms with MICs beyond the breakpoint (i.e.,>16 mg/l) are excluded. Therefore, 14-18% of patients with a \"susceptible\" organism will have suboptimal drug exposure. Furthermore, ~60% of patients will not achieve the plasma or ELF pharmacodynamic targets associated with suppression of antimicrobial resistance (C min /MIC > 3.4). This analysis identifies two important issues. First, 4 g piperacillin three times daily, as a 30-min infusion, is inadequate for effective treatment and suppression of emergence of antimicrobial resistance in an unacceptably high proportion of critically ill patients, and especially in those with pneumonia resulting from infection with a less susceptible organism. Second, the probabilities of achieving each of the pharmacodynamic targets (e.g., fT >MIC and C min /MIC) in plasma and ELF are similar. Plasma piperacillin concentrations do not precisely predict ELF piperacillin concentrations. Consequently, some individuals with \"sufficient\" plasma piperacillin exposure will have inadequate ELF piperacillin exposures and vice versa. ELF rather than plasma exposure has been shown to predict outcome for other antimicrobial agents. 17 The causative organisms were not isolated in our 17 patients, which makes exploration of the relationship between piperacillin plasma and ELF PK, as well as pharmacodynamic (fT >MIC , C min /MIC) and clinical outcomes, impossible. Further appropriately powered clinical studies are required to examine whether piperacillin exposure in plasma or ELF better predicts clinical outcomes.",

Therefore, a subset of patients may have insufficient pulmonary tazobactam concentrations to adequately inhibit some \u03b2-lactamases that cause hydrolysis of piperacillin and clinical failure despite adequate piperacillin exposure. Increasing the tazobactam dosage (while maintaining the piperacillin dosage) may overcome \u03b2-lactamase production, as has been demonstrated in an in vivo meningitis model. 51 Because plasma tazobactam exposure does not reflect tazobactam exposure in ELF, the identification of patients with poor pulmonary tazobactam penetration is difficult and appears to require direct sampling from the lung.",

In addition, we showed an unexpected relationship of increased pulmonary permeability being associated with a reduction in pulmonary piperacillin penetration. We also demonstrated that predicting pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam exposures on the basis of plasma drug exposures may be unreliable. Appropriately powered clinical trials are required to further define the relationship between plasma and pulmonary drug exposures and to establish the impact of pulmonary, rather than plasma, drug exposure on clinical outcome. In addition, preclinical and clinical studies are required to investigate mechanisms of lung penetration in patients with pneumonia. Biomarkers related to pulmonary permeability or drug penetration could be incorporated as covariates into mathematical models to improve predictions of pulmonary drug exposures. New regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam may be required that optimize drug concentrations in the lung, at the site of infection. It is likely that a single regimen is not suitable for all individuals. If ELF exposure is shown to predict clinical outcome with greater accuracy than plasma exposure, and covariates for pulmonary drug penetration cannot be identified, then direct measurement of drug concentrations in the pulmonary compartment and adjustment of individual regimens may be required.",

Twenty microliters of extracted sample was injected onto a Synergi 4u Hydro RP 80A 100 \u00d7 2.0 mm column (Phenomenex, Cheshire, UK). The standard curves for piperacillin and tazobactam, encompassing the concentration ranges of 0.02-10.0 and 0.02-5.0 mg/l, respectively, for plasma and 0.02-10.0 mg/l for lavage fluid were constructed in plasma and blank lavage fluid, respectively. The standard curves were made from stock solutions of 1 mg/l of piperacillin and tazobactam, respectively. The internal standard was caffeine in water at 0.1 mg/l (Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK). The between-day coefficients of variation were <17.4% for piperacillin and <15.5% for tazobactam. The lower limit of detection for piperacillin and tazobactam in plasma and lavage fluid was 0.02 mg/l. Urea concentrations in plasma and lavage fluid were performed using a colorimetric technique (QuantiChromTM Urea Assay Kit DIUR-500, Gentaur BVBA-Bioxys, Kampenhout, Belgium). The standard curve for the urea assay is linear over a concentration range of 0-100 mg/dl. Plasma samples were diluted at 1:5 before measuring urea concentration. Drug concentrations in NBL samples were assumed to reflect ELF drug concentrations after correcting for the dilution introduced by lavage sampling, using the urea dilution method. 37, 38 Urea concentration was assumed to be the same in plasma and ELF. Therefore, comparison of urea concentrations in the plasma and lavage fluid enables an estimation of the dilution caused by instillation of lavage fluid to the lung. Pulmonary permeability was assumed to be proportional to the ratio of the mean total protein concentrations in plasma and ELF. 33 Total protein was quantified in plasma using the total protein assay on an Abbott Architect C16000 (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). This colorimetric assay uses biuret reagent to detect the presence of peptide bonds. The limit of detection for total protein was 0.5 g/dl. The limit of quantification was 0.76 g/dl. The imprecision of the total protein assay is \u22643% of the total coefficient of variation. Protein in ELF was quantified using a UPro assay on an Abbott Architect c8000 (Abbott Laboratories).

A regimen of piperacillin-tazobactam 4/0.5 g, administered over 30 min, every 8 h, was used for the simulations, except for those for the three patients administered piperacillin-tazobactam 4/0.5 g, administered over 30 min, every 12 h, due to renal impairment. For both piperacillin and tazobactam, the AUC was estimated for plasma, for the unbound plasma fraction, and for the total ELF. Protein binding for both piperacillin and tazobactam was assumed to be 30%. 55 The AUCs were calculated at steady state (five doses/32 h after initiation of therapy for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate \u2265 20 ml/min or four doses/36 h after initiation of therapy for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 20 ml/min). The correlations of total ELF to unbound plasma exposure for both piperacillin and tazobactam were assessed. Similarly, the correlations of pulmonary permeability to pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam penetration ratios were assessed. All correlations were analyzed using the Spearman rank test (GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, http:// www.graphpad.com).",

The fraction of simulated subjects who achieved six predefined pharmacodynamic targets for a range of MICs from 0.5 to 128 mg/l was determined. The pharmacodynamic targets, assumed to be relevant in critically ill patients, were an unbound plasma or ELF piperacillin concentration above the MIC for 50% of the dosing interval (50% fT <MIC ), 100% of the dosing interval (100% fT <MIC ), or a trough piperacillin concentration to MIC ratio of \u22653.4. The cumulative response of patients, with a range of MICs defined as susceptible to piperacillin and achieving each of the pharmacodynamic targets, was estimated using a published MIC distribution for organisms causing hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 26 ",
