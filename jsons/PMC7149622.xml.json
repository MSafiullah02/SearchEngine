Most important, mass delivery of mucosal vaccines means that each individual animal does not need to be restrained, which can be extremely stressful for animals (especially those that are not routinely handled by humans), and restraint may be potentially hazardous to the person or teams of people administering the vaccines. A major drawback to mass delivery is that a uniform dose per animal is not always given across the population. Other mucosal routes that require restraint are vaccines administered intranasally, by drenching (oral immunization by syringe), or through eyedrop (conjunctival) administration. These delivery methods have the advantage that they promote a mucosal immune response and the dose per animal is easily controlled, but they do require animal restraint, which makes them more expensive to deliver.",

            "text": "With today\u2019s global economy, trade in animals and in animal products such as meat, eggs, and fur occurs locally, nationally, and internationally. For trade purposes, it is advantageous to be able to distinguish animals that have been infected by disease from animals that have been vaccinated. Vaccines that allow for the immunological differentiation between animals that have been infected and those that have been vaccinated are called DIVA vaccines. DIVA vaccines often lack one or more proteins present in the wild-type microorganism, which can be determined through immune assays. The first-generation DIVA vaccines were developed when it was discovered that pigs vaccinated with the attenuated strains of Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus did not develop antibody against select protein epitopes [6], whereas animals infected by wild-type viruses did have these protein-specific antibodies in their serum. These first-generation marker vaccines were soon improved upon by using genetically modified live vaccines that lacked selected glycoproteins [7], and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assays were developed that could determine which pigs were vaccinated because they lacked antibodies against the glycoprotein but had antibodies specific for other PrV proteins [8]. By using these strains as vaccines or genetically engineered live viral vaccines, researchers could track the success of eradication efforts; this resulted in effective eradication programs of the disease in many parts of Europe [8]. Without the option of using DIVA vaccines, producers may choose not to vaccinate so as to avoid the presence of antibodies in the herd that they cannot guarantee are due to the vaccine and not the presence of the disease-causing agent in their herd. At the same time, vaccines made from live viruses, such as replication-deficient adenovirus that express genes of interest from various pathogens or modified viruses with select genes deleted, are considered genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Animals vaccinated with GMOs may face regulatory hurdles that must be overcome before the products from these animals can be sold. Indeed, some countries are reluctant to license GMO vaccines.",

Further, the vaccine will be used only if it is sufficiently affordable such that its use does not significantly reduce profitability. Depending on the disease, how easily it spreads, and how well the infectious agent survives in the environment, culling of a barn rather than mass vaccination may be a more economically feasible option to clear an infection. However, from a welfare point of view, such a practice is highly problematic and often results in public outcry. Moreover, as antimicrobial-resistant pathogens continue to emerge, there is increasing pressure to raise livestock with reduced levels of antibiotics. Vaccines offer the potential of controlling such infections and represent effective alternatives to antibiotics.",

Twenty-one-day-old piglets were orally immunized with the attenuated S. Typhimurium with empty DNA vaccine or DNA vaccine expressing the S proteins at a dosage of 1.6\u00d71011 CFU per piglet and then booster immunized with 2.0\u00d71011 CFU after 2 weeks.

This disease can lead to genital lesions and reduced fertility in rams, placentitis and abortions in ewes, and increased perinatal mortality in lambs [11]. While safer than subcutaneous vaccination, conjunctival vaccination with live Brucella melitensis Rev 1 vaccine can causes abortions, is highly virulent, and is not a DIVA vaccine; therefore it is not recommended in countries that are free from B. melitensis\n[12]. Alternatively, conjunctival immunization in rams using a thermoresponsive and mucoadhesive in situ gel composed of poloxamer 407 (P407) and chitosan (Ch) could effectively deliver recombinant BLS-OMP31. (BLS is part of the enzyme lumazine synthase from Brucella spp. that is both highly immunogenic and a carrier of foreign peptides and B. ovis antigen OMP31 [13].) Serum and preputial, saliva, lacrimal, and nasal secretions showed significant antigen-specific IgG antibody, and the levels remained elevated in serum only for several months. Relative to unvaccinated rams, the rams from the vaccinated cohort showed significant induction of antigen-specific SIgA after the first and second immunization in lacrimal, preputial, or nasal secretions (but not in nasal secretions or in serum), but antibodies levels declined rapidly [14]. Further, conjunctival immunization induced a significant BLS-OMP31-specific hypersensitivity response to intradermal injections relative to the control rams, which indicates induction of cell-mediated immunity. Conjunctival administration of BLS-OMP31-P407-Ch may be a promising alternative to current B. ovis immunization strategies.",

Parenteral BoHV-1 glycoprotein E deleted mutant viral DIVA vaccines used in conjunction with diagnostic testing and targeted culling of animals infected with field strains has led to eradication of this disease in some European countries [15], [16]. Additional DIVA mucosal vaccines are under development. For example, a small trial showed that calves vaccinated intranasally with BoHV-1 glycoprotein E deleted mutant virus or BoHV-1 triple mutant virus (BoHV-1 tmv), which incorporates mutation for three genes, including glycoprotein E within a single virus, were protected against infectious challenge [17]. While both DIVA vaccines were protective against clinical disease, only BoHV-1 tmv-vaccinated calves generated significantly higher virus-neutralizing titers after challenge relative to the sham controls, and they showed a more rapid cellular immune response onset and a more rapid viral clearance. Although this virus has worldwide distribution, use of marker vaccines will continue to contribute to eradication efforts.",

            "text": "Calves do not receive maternal antibodies in utero; instead, they receive antibodies through colostrum in the neonatal period. However, while maternal antibodies are critically required to protect the vulnerable neonate against infectious diseases, circulating maternal antibodies interfere with the neonate\u2019s ability to develop its own immunity (referred to as maternal interference). Because colostrum is composed mainly of IgG1 (which is not transported across the mucosal epithelium of the upper respiratory tract) and although IgA does cross the mucosa, dimeric IgA makes up only 10% of antibodies in colostrum, it was suggested that the upper respiratory tract may not be affected by maternal interference. To test this hypothesis, cows were vaccinated with modified live bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) vaccine composed of BHV-1, BVDV-1, BVDV-2, PI-3, and BRSV antigens. Calves were shown to have high circulating maternally derived IgG antibodies serum but extremely low titers of maternally derived IgG in nasal secretions [22]. Maternally derived IgA in nasal secretions were present but at much lower levels than in serum. Calves (3\u20138 days old) either were not vaccinated against BVDV or received one or two (day 0 and day 35) immunizations by the intranasal route. Within 5\u20137 days after birth, maternally derived IgA in nasal secretions were not detected. Calf-derived (i.e., endogenous) BVDV1- and BVDV-2-specific IgA production was detected within 10 days after vaccination. A secondary intranasal vaccination after 5 weeks induced a strong memory antibody response with sustained IgA levels in nasal secretions. Collectively, these studies demonstrated that the mucosal immune system in newborn calves is functional and responsive to vaccination without being affected by maternal interference.",

Even the low pathogenic strains such as H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) can affect the economic success of commercial poultry industry by causing mild respiratory disease and decreased egg production. Immunizations for multiple forms of avian influenza are under way as experimental vaccines. For instance, Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 strain was engineered to express select peptides from H9N2 AIV. Both oral and intranasal vaccination of 3-week-old white leghorn layer chickens succeeded in inducing immunity, but the intranasal route induced stronger immunity and showed less body weight loss, lung virus titers, and pathology after challenge with the H9N2 virus [24].

Surgery was performed to isolate each uterine horn, and this triple antigen\u2013triple adjuvant vaccine was injected into the lumen of the uterine horns (referred to as intrauterine immunization) [29]. Significant induction of OVA and tGD-specific serum IgG and IgA was observed over time in intrauterine-immunized animals. Uterine, lung, and vaginal tissues obtained 1 month after the single immunization showed significant OVA-specific IgG and IgA response relative to sham treatment. Significantly increased tGD-specific and rVP2-TrX antigen-specific IgG titers (but not IgA titers) were observed in lung, vagina, and uterine tissue relative to controls. The results indicate that a subunit vaccine formulated with appropriate adjuvants can trigger both systemic and mucosal immunity when administered into the uterine lumen.\n",

Although the vaccine was administered subcutaneously, anti-MOMP IgA increased 10- to 100-fold at ocular and upper genital tract (UGT) sites in 50% and 40% of the koalas, respectively. The PmpG vaccine also triggered a 10- to 100-fold increase post vaccine IgA antibodies at the UGT or the ocular sites in 40% and 50% of koalas, respectively, which suggests that the vaccines elicited a mucosal response in at least some of the koalas. The cohort vaccinated with MOMP vaccine showed decreased chlamydia loads with no new occurrence of infection, but the other vaccination group and the control group showed increased loads with incidences of new infections, suggesting that the MOMP vaccine may be superior [31]. Further development must be undertaken to improve vaccine uptake to more members of the population, but these results suggest that a parenteral vaccine may succeed in promoting mucosal responses when properly formulated.",

The immunized cows had a greater number of follicular waves and a greater number of follicles during the estrous cycle, which could be used as a potential source of oocytes for use in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer programs [62]. Advances have been made with mucosally delivered inhibin vaccines. In buffalo, nasal immunization with a DNA vaccine coding for inhibin and delivered by attenuated Salmonella Cholerasuis has been shown to improve follicle development and fertility [63]. However, the buffalo in this trial underwent estrous synchronization, which would not be feasible in the wild and will have to be investigated further to establish its feasibility as a fertility vaccine. While immunization against select targets may affect fertility, care should be taken that targeting a natural protein may affect other pathways that are important for the animal\u2019s health. Further, should ovulation rates be affected, it must be established that an increased number of dams do not suffer from complications associated with multiple offspring per parturition before it is known that the vaccine is safe to use.",

For example, chicks orally immunized on the first day of life then boosted orally or via the intramuscular route at 6 and 16 weeks of age with a novel attenuated Salmonella Enteridis vaccine candidate, showed significantly higher plasma IgG and intestinal SIgA levels as compared to those in the control group\n[64]. The lymphocyte proliferation response and CD45+ CD3+ T cell number in the peripheral blood of the vaccinated groups were significantly increased. When the birds were challenged intravenously with the virulent S. enteritidis strain in the 24th week, the egg contamination rates were significantly reduced in both vaccinated groups relative to the controls, but total protection was not achieved. These results indicate that this vaccine may reduce incidences of egg contamination and therefore reduce the risk of human salmonellosis.",

Cattle are widely recognized as an important reservoir of STEC O157 for human exposure, making contaminated beef a potential source of food-borne infection. Parenteral vaccination with a combination of antigens associated with type III secretion system-mediated adherence results in significantly reduced shedding in orally infected animals [65]. As yet, no mucosal vaccines have been developed that significantly reduce colonization in cattle, potentially because of poor cross-protection across STEC strains.",

Research is underway to further improve those vaccines, be it through the use of novel adjuvants, better delivery systems, or effective targeting to the site of uptake at mucosal surfaces. However, it is important to note that most of these vaccines are extremely cost-effective, at pennies per dose, and are used as part of mass vaccination in poultry and fish. Thus one would hope that human vaccine manufacturers and regulators recognize the benefits and potential this technology can offer and start to develop mucosal vaccines for humans at a cost-effective price. While some vaccines are already available for mucosal administration in humans, mucosal vaccination has, unfortunately, not yet become part of routine immunization practices in humans.",
