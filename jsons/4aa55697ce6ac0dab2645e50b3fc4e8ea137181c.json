Overfitting a logistic regression model can lead to spuriously high area under the receiver operating curve implying good model discrimination. However, this limits the generalizability applied to another population. Each of the models violate this principal (Table 1 ), although we note that model 4, with the poorest performance was close to meeting this criteria.",

When describing the clinical characteristics of patients included in the models the authors do not provide sufficient detail for others to replicate and externally validate their tool, with descriptors such as \"elevated body temperature\" and \"elevated respiratory rate\".",
