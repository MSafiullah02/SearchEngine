However, to make it practical as a decision support tool for policy maker, it should be combined with business operation of epidemic control. Thus, an alert and response framework covering outbreak detection, policy analysis and policy execution is proposed in this paper. Key technologies for such a framework at modeling, analysis and data collection aspects are discussed. Sensitivity analysis is proposed for model verification and confidence analysis. Critical point identification is another important topic for control policy making by network topology analysis. The importance and feasibility of these technologies are illustrated by the experiment on Beijing SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) data in 2003.",

At present, epidemics spreading control policy making is still heavily based on heuristic experience in past epidemic control. There is a big gap to be an effective control. On one hand, past experience is not always applicable to current cases due to diseases evolvement, social behavior change, transportation network improvement, and other social and environmental changes. On the other hand, effective epidemic control needs more precise estimations besides heuristic experience. So there is a great need of quantitative methods for policy maker in spreading control, such as spreading pattern analysis, critical control point through spreading and social network analysis, and policy comparison through what-if or scenario analysis. However, current research mostly focus on spreading process prediction by mathematical or simulation methods, which is not closely aligned with business operation of epidemic control. The purpose of this paper is to analysis the technology requirement and gap for the business operation and propose a technology framework for future work.",

So only a brief review from model structure and research approach perspective is presented here. Epidemics models can be distinguished from different perspectives: 1) continuous model where the total population can be partitioned infinitely, or discrete model with individual as the smallest grain, 2) pure temporary model, or spatialtemporary model, and 3) stochastic/determined model. SIR (Susceptible, Infective, and Recovered) model is the start point of many other continuous models for epidemic spreading, such as SIS, SEIR ('M' denotes 'Recovered'), MSEIR ('M' denotes \"maternal antibody protection\"), etc., All these models assume that the population is \"well mixed\" (i.e., either not distributed or geographically distributed in a uniform manner). With the application of computer simulation, more complicated models are proposed considering spatial dimension, traffic network, diversity of population and many other important factors. For example, global epidemics spreading model through air travel infrastructure is proposed by Colizza et al. [2] .",

The typical software include Epimap, HealthMapper, SIGEpi, etc. The third generation epidemic software has more considerations to the impact of social and environmental factors. EpiSims [3] is an agent-based modeling platform based on individuals everyday behaviors. A disadvantage of this approach is that it requires large amounts of computing resources even for small models. To avoid such disadvantage, STEM is developed by Ford et al.

Interview usually requires onerous effort. Some automatic approaches may be developed based on novel technologies. For example, cell-phone positioning technology is potential to be adopted in generating travel behavior or traffic flow data. For modeling, a big challenge is how to obtain a precise estimation of model parameters. In epidemics spreading process, new epidemics data are continuously available with the development of disease. So the adaptive parameter estimation method is more desired. Furthermore, even if the monitoring system is full-scale, not all the states are observable, such as people exposed or in incubation period. State observer technology from control theory may be used to estimate the parameters or hidden states.",
