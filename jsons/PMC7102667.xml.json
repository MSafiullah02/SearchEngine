Then, proper hand hygiene should be performed using an alcohol-based solution.

After the gown, donning a filtering face-piece (N95, FFP2, or FFP3) respirator is recommended; it is crucial to perform a fitting test after the equipment has been put on the face. In case of shortage of filtering face-piece respirators, the use of a surgical mask as substitution is recommended. Once the respirator has been correctly positioned, the next step is goggles for eye protection.

Similarly, the 2018 European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines17 recommend that all endoscopes and reusable accessories should be reprocessed with a uniform, standardized reprocessing procedure. Disinfectants used for this purpose should be tested according to the European Standard EN 14885. The product used must be as follows: bactericidal, mycobactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal against enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Cases of hepatitis B and C virus transmission have been reported in the medical literature but have been related to inappropriate cleaning and disinfection. When all currently reprocessing guidelines are strictly followed, the risk of transmission of any kind of viruses is extremely rare to nonexistent. This is why we have reinforced training sessions and personnel meetings on the importance of strictly following endoscope reprocessing policy as a safe and efficient method to prevent the spread of viral infection.",

Standard room disinfection policy should be kept in rooms where non\u2013COVID-19 or low-risk patients undergo endoscopy. For surface and noncritical patient-care equipment disinfection, we are currently using 1:100 dilution of household bleach and water.18 In negative-pressure rooms, a delay of about 30 minutes is suggested before allowing a new patient to enter the room. Because small particles remain airborne for some period of time, in the absence of negative-pressure rooms alternative measures such as diluting the air with cleaner air from the outdoors should be considered and the room kept empty for at least 1 hour.",
