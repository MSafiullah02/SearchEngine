Donnelly et al. estimated that each year there are 43 million emergency department (ED) visits for patients <5 years of age with a diagnosis of ARTI (rate: 354 per 1000 ED visits). [3]. Antimicrobials are not indicated for the common cold, bronchitis/bronchiolitis and the vast majority of pharyngitis cases, and specific criteria exists to target appropriate antibiotic use for otitis media, sinusitis and streptococcal pharyngitis. Yet, antibiotic prescribing is very common among children with ARTI, for bronchitis (71%), sinusitis (89%), and acute otitis media (86%) [4]. A study evaluating bronchiolitis management before and after the 2006 AAP guidelines found a significant reduction in RSV testing (p < .001) and decreased corticosteroids and bronchodilators use (p < .001) [5]. However, the trend in antibiotic use did not change (p = .07) in the post-AAP guideline period further highlighting the significant problem of overuse of antibiotics for ARTI.",

            "text": "While the use of stringent diagnostic criteria to confirm the diagnosis of ARTI is key in optimizing antibiotic prescribing, empiric treatment for ARTI remains common because viral symptoms are often clinically similar and difficult to distinguish from those caused by bacteria. Therefore, laboratory testing that provides accurate and prompt detection of pathogens associated with respiratory infections is important for proper patient care management. Molecular respiratory panel (MRP) assays are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to detect multiple pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity and documented cost savings [[6], [7], [8]]. While research has demonstrated that MRPs may have a positive impact on patient outcomes such as decreasing empiric antibiotic exposures, length of hospital stay (LOS), and improving timely oseltamivir treatment for influenza patients [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]], there is a dearth of information on whether this clinical impact is conditional on the turn-around-time (TAT) of the MRP assay.",

The prevalence of narrow- and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment was also calculated, including the duration of empiric therapy, which was defined as the time difference, in hours, between the first and last antibiotic administration. We considered penicillin, ampicillin and clindamycin as narrow-spectrum antibiotics; all other antibiotics were considered broad-spectrum. We also evaluated use of chest radiographs within the first 48 h of admission and LOS (in hours) as secondary outcomes.

Our study included 5142 pediatric patients with positive respiratory pathogens that were collected over 6 years. We observed that relying on rapid diagnostic testing for ARTI cases may have a direct impact for the patient management, including reducing unnecessary antibiotic and radiation exposure, and reducing LOS.",

Second, this was a single-center study at a freestanding pediatric hospital, therefore our results may not generalize to all centers that provide care for ARTI. Third, we did not examine concurrent bacterial infections, which could partly explain empiric antibiotic treatment. Since the prevalence of concurrent bacterial infection is unlikely to be influenced by the assay type (i.e., RVP/RP), we would argue the potential of this biasing our results is minimal. We observed less human metapneumovirus and influenza cases during the RP phase which may have influenced treatment strategies, especially oseltamivir use. Patients tested but never admitted were excluded, thus our inpatient sample may represent patients with more severe ARTI symptoms. Lastly, we did exclude patients who tested negative, thus our study does not provide a complete representation of ARTI patients but rather addresses the importance of rapid respiratory pathogen detection on management of hospitalized patients.
