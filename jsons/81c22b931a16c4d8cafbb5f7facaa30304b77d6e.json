Stating from Na 2 WO 4 \u22c52H 2 O and CoCl 2 \u22c56H 2 O we synthesized two types of nano-CoWO 4 with different morphologies. The products were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, HRTEM, XPS and EDS in details. The electrochemical performance of CoWO 4 nanorods was obviously superior to CoWO 4 nanodots due to the enhanced electrochemical active areas. Furthermore, CoWO 4 and nitrogen-doped graphene oxides (NGO) composites were obtained under the similar synthetic conditions. As expected, the CoWO 4 /NGO composites showed significant improvement on electrochemical properties.",

The electrochemical performance of the materials can be greatly enhanced by compounding with graphene [17, 18] . However graphene has poor water solubility, and it is difficult to form homogeneous phase in solution. In contrast, graphene oxide can be uniformly dispersed in an aqueous solution due to the hydrophilic groups attached on surface. However, graphene oxide is easy to accumulate and agglomerate, resulting in a decreased effective specific surface area of the catalyst. In addition, the conductivity of graphene oxide is much weaker than that of graphene. Therefore, the electrochemical properties of tungstate composites constructed with graphene oxide may not be well expected.",

To further verify this, we compared the specific surface area and electrochemical active area of two materials. The pore size distribution is shown in Fig. 7a, and Fig. 7b is the nitrogen adsorption desorption curve. The specific surface area of CoWO 4 nanodots is 17.6 m 2 /g, while it is 30.9 m 2 /g for nanorods. In addition, we tested the electrochemical active area by cyclic voltammetry in the range of 0-0.05 V (vs SCE) at scan speeds of 20-100 mV/s, and the results are shown in Fig. 8a-b . It can be seen that the electrode has no oxidation reduction peak in the range of test interval, and the current density of anode and cathode are basically symmetrical with a good reversibility. Five linearly related data points as shown in Fig. 8c at 0.025 V (vs SCE). The slope is the C d l of electrode, and the surface roughness of which can be calculated by R f \u00bc C dl = \u00f060 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 F=cm 2 \u00de. The electrochemical active area of nanorods is calculated to be 1.35 times larger then that of nanodots (Please refer the fitting details in the Fig. 8c.) . In this way, the data of specific surface area and electrochemical active area may confirm that the morphology of nano-CoWO 4 significantly impacts the electrocatalytic oxygen generation performance.",

A strong peak can be observed at 2\u03b8 \u00bc 11:6 , and it gives the distance between GO layers d \u00bc 0:78 nm by the Bragg equation. Comparing to the d \u00bc 0:34 nm of standard graphite layers, this larger distance is due to the oxygen-containing functional groups inserted in the layers during the oxidization. Fig. 10 shows the SEM graph of GO and NGO. Clearly the surface of GO is relatively more smooth than NGO, which has obvious wrinkles and the pieces are more fractal, this is because the nitrogen doping destructs and twists the graphene plane. Furthermore, we observed discharging phenomenon during the SEM photographing on GO but not on NGO, meaning a better conductivity of NGO. And both the factors of larger surface area and higher conductivity imply a better electrochemical performance. To further investigate the chemical composition of GO and NGO we prepared, the XPS analysis has been done and the result of C 1s of GO is shown in Fig. 11a , and the N 1s of NGO is shown in Fig. 11b . The fitting analysis in Fig. 11a indicates four states of carbon: C--C (284.7 eV), C-N (285.8 eV), C-O (286.5 eV) and O-C--O (289.9 eV) [17] . Meanwhile, the fitting analysis in Fig. 11b indicates three states of nitrogen: the pyridine nitrogen at 398.3 eV, the pyrrole nitrogen at 399.8 eV, and the graphitized nitrogen at 400.9 eV [18, 19] . Pyridine and pyrrole N is due to the substitute of carbon atom by nitrogen on the graphene net. The existence of these three types of N confirms the formation of C-N bond during the reaction, and the nitrogen was successfully doped into the GO.",

To confirm that the addition of NGO of decent amount does not alter the crystal phase of nano-CoWO 4 , we performed the XRD tests on three samples, and the results are shown in Fig. 13 . It can be seen that, regardless of the amount of NGO added, the main diffraction peaks accord well to the JCPDS No. 15-0687, which is the monoclinic phase of CoWO 4 . Fig. 14 shows the SEM graphs and S1, S2, and S3 and the CoWO 4 nanorods, the direct observations on the pictures also confirms that the addition of NGO does not affect the morphology too much.",

The LSV results shown in Fig. 15 clearly indicate that the attendance of NGO significantly improves the electrochemical performance of CoWO 4 nanorods, however not in a proportional way. The current density increases with amount of NGO below 0.5 mL, and decreases after that, which yields the S2 to be the optimal sample. The ultra thin thickness and conjugated \u03c0 bond may increase the charge transportation and subsequently the oxygen evolution reaction speed [17] . On the other hand, more percentage of NGO may occupy too much space and the surface area of nano-CoWO 4 , and therefore reversely obstruct the electrochemical performance.",
