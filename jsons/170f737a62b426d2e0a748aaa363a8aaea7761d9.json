We investigated the monthly variance of ischemic stroke using the ANOVA test. Surprisingly, between February 21, 2020 (first SARS-CoV-2 patient recorded in Italy -in Codogno, a nearby city), and March 25, 2020, there were only 6 admissions from the Casualty Department for ischemic stroke (2 transient ischemic attacks, 1 cardioembolic LVO, and 3 lacunar stroke).",

Moreover, the population was asked to refer to the Casualty Department only if really necessary. It is true that the significant reduction in currently registered strokes may well be attributable to fewer people going to the Casualty Department for fear of being infected. However, this can be true only for minor, non-disabling strokes. LVO strokes are always disabling (i.e., aphasia and/or hemiplegia), and it is impossible to avoid hospitalization in such a serious condition. Moreover, the point is that there may be an underestimation of the number of stroke, as when patients arrive in a Casualty Department with fever and respiratory distress, they take priority and the neurological deficit may, therefore, be overlooked.",

Furthermore, based on previous evidence, the burden of chronic persistent infections and/or past infections, rather than one single current infectious disease, seems to be associated with stroke risk [13] .
