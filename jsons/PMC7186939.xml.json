Using a computational tool designed to predict candidate neoantigens for cancer vaccines, this preprint identifies 1,103 unique 9-mer antigens from the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome, each of which binds to a median of 3 of 1,022 HLA class I alleles. This resulted in 6,748 peptide\u2013MHC pairs with high binding affinity. Up to 684 peptides were derived from each viral protein tested. Furthermore, 12 of the identified SARS-CoV-2 epitopes match SARS-CoV epitopes that were previously shown to generate T cell responses ex vivo and in vitro. This publicly available dataset will be an important resource to guide vaccine development.",
