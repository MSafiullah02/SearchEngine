The ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein to detect both IgM and IgG antibodies. This invitro device was registered in Germany in March 2020 (DE/CA22/419-822.3-IVD; catalogue number INCP-402). 3 Among the 14 patients with COVID-19, six belonged to the symptomatic group and eight belonged to the asymptomatic/mild symptom group.

His rRT-PCR showed a positive result only on day 1 (cycle threshold [ct] value, 33), but was negative in the three subsequent rRT-PCR tests with an interval of 48 hours. Except case 13, the duration of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by positive rRT-PCR was generally longer in the asymptomatic/mild symptom group than the symptomatic group.In our study, the earliest detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM was on day 5 in case 1 and the longest persistence was found on day 42 in case 2. For SARS-CoV-2 IgG, the earliest detection was on day 5 in case 1, and most cases persistently had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG results after positive conversion. On the contrary, all 28 control serum samples, including the three samples with the presence of known non-SARS-CoV-2-viral antibodies, were negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test kit based on the rRT-PCR results was 78.6% and 100%, respectively.In our study, we demonstrated dynamics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG among 14 patients with different clinical manifestations. The duration of positive rRT-PCR persistence was associated with antibody response and clinical manifestations. Patients with prominent symptoms and development of anti-SARS-CoV 2 IgM antibodies tended to have short viral shedding by rRT-PCR.In China, another rapid LFIA using a recombinant antigen, the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, to detect both SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies, was tested on 397 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 128 control cases.4 This assay showed a testing sensitivity of 88.7% and specificity of 90.3% for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (the presence of either IgG or IgM antibodies, or both). The turnaround time of IgG/IgM test is much less than that of rRT-PCR, which shortens the quarantine period and facilitates in efficacious use of hospital beds. However, the antibody test may also compromise the sensitivity and specificity of rRT-PCR. The timing, quality, and quantity of antibody response might be associated with clinical manifestations and disease course, and this therefore warrants further investigations.The ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette is a rapid LFIA (turn-around time within 15 min) that uses a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein to detect both IgM and IgG antibodies.3 In comparison with the results using conventional rRT-PCR (22 positive and 100 negative serum samples), the relative sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results from the ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette were claimed to be >99.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 82.5%-100%), 98.0% (95% CI, 92.6%-99.9%), and 98.4% (95% CI, 93.9%-99.9%), respectively. However, the relative sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rate for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies were only 90.9% (95% CI, 71.0%-98.7%), 97.0% (95% CI: 91.8%-99.4%), and 95.9% (95% CI, 90.5%-98.5%), respectively.3 The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein used in this assay shares homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not common seasonal human coronaviruses (i.e., 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1). As a result, no cross-reaction with the four human coronaviruses was claimed by the manusfacturer.3 In a recent study conducted during the COVID-19 epidemic, 43 respiratory specimens collected from 43 suspected COVID-19 patients were subjected to rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and FilmArray respiratory panel(BioFire Diagnostics, bioMe\u00b4rieux, Utah, USA) assays Two were positive for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and another three were positive for coronavirus 229E/OC43; no co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43) were identified. 5 In the present study, patients with symptoms and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies had a shorter duration of positive rRT-PCR result and were discharged with relatively stable conditions. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were absent in three patients (cases 11-13) in the asymptomatic/mild symptom group who had positive rRT-PCR results. In case 13, a false-positive rRT-PCR result was highly suspected by the attending physicians and the negative IgG result might support the clinicians' suspicion. However, the presence of lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers may have contributed to the negative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results obtained by the rapid test. Further studies for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2-specific proteins or neutralizing antibodies should be conducted to verify the performance of the rapid test kit. The significance of antibody response in COVID-19 is important, not only in the diagnosis but also prognosis. Specific antibodies, including IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies, are important for protecting the host from infection by blocking viral entry into host cells after viral infection. 6 Contrarily, there are no vaccines or medications available for SARS-CoV-2 to date. The administration of convalescent sera from recovered individuals was proposed as an option for treatment to provide immediate immunity to susceptible or infected persons. 7 Several limitations were found in our study. First, the sample size is small, as we included only 14 COVID-19 patients. Second, a further western blot assay for detecting the anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific protein IgG or IgM antibodies was not performed to validate the performance of the ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test and understand the inconsistency in the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. Third, cross reaction of serum specimens from the acute phase of different viral infections (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus.) in the IgM portion of this SARS-CoV-2 assay was not performed. Finally, different SARS-CoV-2 strains or genotypes may also interfere with disease outcome and antibody response; however, viral cultures for all patients in our study were not performed and genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 strains were not investigated. 8 In summary, we performed an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM test on 14 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 28 negative controls. Antibody response varied with different clinical manifestations and disease severity. Patients with symptoms and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies had a shorter duration of positive rRT-PCR result and no worsening clinical conditions compared to those without the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies. The serological data can provide more information about epidemiological linkage and disease prognosis for the new emerging COVID-19 pandemic.",
