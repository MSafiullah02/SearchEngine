The association of burnout with compassion satisfaction, secondary stress, emotional coping strategies and many psychosocial variables, such as institutional support, friendship, and spirituality, have not been well studied. A convenience sample of internal medicine physicians was emailed a survey using validated instruments to explore these associations. The response rate was 337/1021 (33%), with a burnout prevalence of 175/337 (52%). Grit, acceptance, active coping, positive reframing, and strategy planning were associated with lower burnout domains and greater compassion satisfaction. Certain emotional coping strategies such as denial, disengagement, self-blame, substance abuse, and venting were associated with greater burnout and lower compassion satisfaction. Greater institutional support was associated with lower burnout (r = \u2212 .35, p < .001), secondary stress (r = \u2212 .14, p < .05), and compassion satisfaction (r = .28, p < .0001). Friendship was associated with lower burnout (r = \u2212 .25, p < .0001) and greater compassion satisfaction (r = .28, p < .0001). This study suggests that amelioration of burnout requires both intrinsic strategies that emphasize physician coping skills as well as extrinsic strategies that address institutional support.",

            "text": "Physician burnout is associated with worse patient care, increased medical errors, substandard professionalism, and poor mental health (Williams, Manwell, Konrad, & Linzer, 2007) . To complement the triple aim of improving health, ameliorating the patient experience, and reducing costs, the importance of improving physician wellness has been heralded as \"the fourth aim\" (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014) . Burnout is defined as a constellation of three domains: emotional exhaustion, where the provider is depleted of emotional, spiritual, and physical energy, depersonalization, characterized by cynicism and objectification of the other, and reduced personal accomplishment, marked by feelings of low job satisfaction (Maslach, Jackson, & Leiter, 1996) 44% of the physician population meets these criteria (Shanafelt et al., 2019) . Demographic variables that correlate with burnout have been well described. Physicians experiencing burnout tend to be earlier in their career, as they are establishing themselves in their first jobs, contending with debt, and starting a family (Chopra, Sotile, & Sotile, 2004) . Reduced burnout is associated with male physicians, those who are married, and having children (Chopra et al., 2004) . Other work-related variables are associated with increased burnout: longer work hours, increased patient care responsibility, demands imposed by working with electronic medical records (EMRs), and lack of continuing education (Chopra et al., 2004) . Even as EMRs have evolved, physician burnout is associated with dissatisfaction with their clerical burdens and interference with direct patient care .",

Emotional strengths, such as resilience and optimism, can be an important coping strategies (Doolittle, Windish, & Seelig, 2013) . Also, institutional support, as by defined by physicians' perception that they are mentored and encouraged by departmental leaders, is associated with lower burnout (Yost, Eshelman, Raoufi, & Abouljoud, 2005) . Social support and friendship have been shown to correlate with improved quality of life and burnout in at least two small cohort studies among Canadian rural practitioners and Serbian physicians (Lavanchy et al., 2004; Vicentic et al., 2013) . Religion, from personal spirituality to organized religious practice, has also been shown to correlate with improved mental health, especially depression, anxiety disorders, and suicidality (Bonelli and Koenig, 2013) . Friendship, social support, religion, and institutional support have not been widely studied among internal medicine physicians. Further, resilience, the quality of persevering despite difficulties, has emerged as a recent construct in the burnout conversation but has shown only a weak correlation with reduced burnout among physicians (Halliday, Walker, Vig, Hines, & Brecknell, 2017) .",

Compassion satisfaction is the sense of achievement, purpose, and joy generated from pursuing emotionally demanding work (Stamm, 2005) . In contrast, secondary stress, also known as compassion fatigue, highlights the acquired stress that practitioners experience while attending to the intense emotional needs of their clients. Secondary stress is specifically related to caregiver strain from treating trauma victims and mirrors the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, with such symptoms as hyperarousal, numbness, anxiety, and avoidance. While similar, burnout is a different construct that investigates job-related exhaustion, disengagement, and low satisfaction. Although tightly correlated, secondary stress and burnout evolved from different research questions (El-bar et al., 2013) . Practitioners can be energized by their role as healers or, in turn, internalize the stress and suffering experienced by patients. These concepts merit further exploration in the context of physician burnout and well-being.",

There is a constellation of emotional coping strategies and practices that suggests a disposition of wellness and tenacity among those physicians with lower levels of burnout, secondary stress, and higher levels of compassion satisfaction. These physicians have higher levels of positive copings strategies such as grit, acceptance, active coping, positive reframing, strategy planning, and even physical exercise. These findings have very provocative implications for the emotional health of the physician workforce. Can positive emotional coping be taught? Many studies show training in resiliency strategies reduce burnout, perceived stress, and improve perceived ability to manage stress but there are few studies among physicians (Robertson et al., 2015) . Of note, a pilot study of an 8-week, abbreviated mindfulness-based stress reduction class designed for primary care physicians showed reduction in Maslach burnout subscales, but no improvement in resilience (Fortney, Luchterhand, Zakletskaia, Zgierska, & Rakel, 2013) . Another study by West et al (2014) organized bi-monthly small-group training sessions for physicians to learn mindfulness and coping skills for 9 months. This program demonstrated improved engagement, empowerment, and decreased depersonalization among the intervention group. These effects were maintained at a 12-month follow-up. Providing opportunities to optimize resilience and improve emotional coping strategies can be an important resource for physician wellness . Institutional leadership would benefit from formal collaboration with psychologists, and other mental health providers to design, implement, and evaluation interventions to address burnout.",

            "text": "In this study, there are two extrinsic, psychosocial variables that are associated with lower burnout, secondary stress, and compassion satisfaction: institutional support and friendship. Friendship has been scarcely studied in the literature. Physicians who endorsed stronger friendships reported lower burnout and greater compassion satisfaction. Similarly, those physicians who felt well supported by their institution also had lower burnout and greater compassion satisfaction. While causation cannot be implied, social support, friendships, and institutional culture may play an important role to mitigate burnout. Social support has been associated with job satisfaction in several studies among nurses but has not been well studied among physicians (Woodhead, In this study, religion and spirituality had no correlation with any burnout domain. Neither religious attendance, internal practices, nor communal practices were associated with any ProQol domains. Religious involvement has been shown in many studies to correlate with improved mental health, especially among those with depression, anxiety, and suicidality (Koenig & Bussing, 2010) . Further study is needed to explore this important resource among physicians. Linzer et al (2014) suggests several steps that organizations should employ to optimize physician wellness. These include making wellness a measurable quality indicator, similar to catheter-related infections and hospital readmission rates, which promotes tracking and dialogue around workplace culture. Other evidence-based interventions include mindfulness training, optimizing the electronic medical record, and improving resources in the work environment such as job-sharing and increased ancillary staff (Linzer et al., 2014) . In addition, institutions need to hire leaders who foster a collaborative, supportive environment. Physician retention and satisfaction has an important impact upon institutions. The cost of replacing a primary care physician is 2-3 times a physician salary (Buchbinder, Wilson, Melick, & Powe, 1999; Misra-Hebert, Kay, & Stoller, 2004) . Physicians who experience burnout are more likely to commit medical errors (Shanafelt et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2007) . In an era when insurance companies withhold payments and penalize hospitals for readmission rates and poor quality indicators, addressing physician satisfaction can potentially save lives and positively confer cost savings.",

Yet, the prevalence of burnout was consistent with prior studies of physicians (Shanafelt et al., 2019) . Second, these associations are observational. It is difficult to infer causation. For example, does greater resilience prevent secondary stress? Or, does the secondary stress exhaust the resilience of the physician?
