The intentional use of living organisms or infected materials derived from them has occurred over centuries during war and peacetime by armies, states, groups, and individuals [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. A wide range of microorganisms could be used as biological weapons. Few microorganisms can be used for production of weapons of mass destruction, however. Eligible agents should meet criteria such as availability, ease of dissemination, stability, and potential for high morbidity and mortality to qualify as a weapon of mass destruction [6].",
