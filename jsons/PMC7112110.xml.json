Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an avian gammacoronavirus that causes respiratory disease in chickens, resulting in major economic burden to the poultry industry worldwide. In IBV-infected cells, a 3\u2032-coterminal nested set of six mRNA species, including the genome-length mRNA (mRNA1) and five subgenomic mRNA species (mRNA2-6), is expressed. Four structural proteins, the type 1 glycoprotein spike (S), the small membrane-associated envelope protein (E), the integral membrane protein (M) and the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), are encoded by subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) 2, 3, 4 and 6, respectively (Liu et al., 1991, Liu and Inglis, 1992a, Zhao et al., 1993). In addition, four accessory proteins, 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b are encoded by sgRNA 3 and 5 (Liu and Inglis, 1992a, Liu and Inglis, 1992b).",

            "text": "During coronavirus infection, full-length genome is replicated for packaging into progeny virions, while sgRNAs are transcribed for the expression of structural proteins. These two processes are dependent upon viral ability to synthesize both the positive-sense genomic mRNA (gRNA) and a nested set of positive-sense sgRNAs. The key player in this part of the coronavirus life cycle is the virus-encoded replicase gene, which makes up two thirds of the genome and is translated into two polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab. The two polyproteins are then auto-proteolytically processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) by two virus-encoded proteases, the papain-like protease encoded in nsp3 and the 3C-like (main) protease encoded in nsp5 (Liu et al., 1994, Liu et al., 1995, Liu et al., 1997, Liu et al., 1998, Liu and Brown, 1995, Ng and Liu, 1998, Ng and Liu, 2000, Ng and Liu, 2002, Lim and Liu, 1998, Lim et al., 2000, Xu et al., 2001, Fang et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2009). Notably, due to the lack of a cleavage site that usually lies between nsp1 and nsp2 in other coronaviruses, cleavage of the IBV replicase only produces 15 nsps (nsp2-16) without the counterpart of nsp1. Based on sequence comparison, biochemical and structural studies, the enzymatic activities required for most of the key processes in coronavirus RNA synthesis have been mapped to some of the nsps (Pasternak et al., 2006). Among them, the key enzyme critical to the viral ability to replicate its genome and propagate in the host cell is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) or nsp12. Available evidence suggests that the RNA polymerase activity of nsp12 may be primer-dependent (te Velthuis et al., 2010) and require the primase activity of nsp8 (Imbert et al., 2006). Other important enzymatic activities include the RNA helicase of nsp13 (Seybert et al., 2000, Ivanov et al., 2004a), the methyltransferase activities of nsp14 and nsp16 (Chen et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2015, Decroly et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2011, Bouvet et al., 2010), the exoribonuclease activity of nsp14 (Ma et al., 2015, Minskaia et al., 2006) and the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 (Ivanov et al., 2004b, Bhardwaj et al., 2004, Ricagno et al., 2006).",

Distinct from the viral structural proteins, the functions served by the nsps are focused on the modulation of host environment to support viral replication and viral RNA synthesis. Integral membrane proteins nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 engage in homotypic and heterotypic interactions to drive membrane rearrangements to form the network of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs) (Angelini et al., 2013), or double membrane spherules from zippered ER membranes (Maier et al., 2013), the sites of viral replication and also serve as the docking site for viral replication complexes (Oostra et al., 2008). A recent study has identified critical residues on nsp7 and nsp8 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which are essential for efficient de novo RNA synthesis by nsp12, indicating that interactions among these proteins contribute to the processivity of RNA synthesis (Subissi et al., 2014).",

Viral protein-RNA interactions are assumed to occur between the key replication enzymes, nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12, thus forming a complex exhibiting replicase activity in the presence of a RNA primer (Subissi et al., 2014). In addition, although some nsps have not been assigned with functions involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis, they might still be participating in viral RNA replication or transcription. In this study, a two-pronged approach was adopted to study viral proteins and protein-RNA interactions in coronavirus RNA synthesis. To elucidate RNA-protein interactions, an attempt was made to detect the presence of RNA-binding activity in any of the IBV nsps, which had not been previously reported to possess such an activity. This was done using available constructs over-expressing individual nsps in a biotin pull-down assay with biotinylated probes. The second method used was to conduct a screen for protein-protein interactions between viral polymerase, nsp12 and other nsps.",

Because similar numbers of cells were used for infection and virus replication was comparable, the protein levels of host housekeeping genes were similar in cells infected with wild-type rIBV and rIBV-HA-RdRP, as determined by Western blot analysis of GAPDH and \u03b2-actin (data not shown).

Only if the target protein of correct molecular weight was detected at similar levels in the whole cell lysates, but could only be detected in the co-immunoprecipitated sample from rIBV-HA-RdRP-infected cells, it would be considered to be a potential interacting partner of HA-tagged nsp12.",

For the structural proteins, S protein was not detected in the immunoprecipitated samples, while a similar level of N was detected in cells infected with wild type IBV and rIBV-HA-RdRP (HA) (Fig. 2, panels anti-IBV S and N). Although it appeared that the amount co-precipitated in rIBV-HA-RdRP-infected samples was slightly higher compared to wild type IBV infected samples, the amount detected in the cell lysates was also slightly higher. So it was unlikely for N to have been specifically co-precipitated by an interaction with nsp12. Nsp3, nsp5, nsp8 and nsp14, but not nsp10, nsp13 and nsp15/nsp16, were specifically detected in the precipitated samples of rIBV-HA-RdRP-infected cells (Fig. 2). As previously reported, a dominant band with an apparent molecular weight of 58 kDa could be detected by Western blot in cells infected with wild type IBV with anti-nsp14 antiserum (Fang et al., 2007). This was proved to be a nonspecific band from our previous work (Xu et al., 2010). As nsp14 band is usually very weak and migrates on SDS-PAGE gel just below this non-specific band, much more samples were added during precipitation and gel loading, leading to the detection of a specific band representing nsp14 in HA-beads precipitated samples (Fig. 2). However, this band cannot be separated from the non-specific band in total cell lysates (Fig. 2). Anti-nsp13 antibodies failed to detect a specific band representing nsp13 either in total cell lysates or in HA-beads precipitated samples (Fig. 2). This issue will be further studied by using a recombinant virus with HA-tagged nsp13 (Zhai et al., 2005).",

Due to either the very low expression efficiency or the lack of distinctive band, the screen data for nsp3, nsp4, nsp6 and nsp13 were not included. Total cell lysates were used in biotin pull-down assays with biotinylated 5\u2032-UTR (+), 5\u2032-UTR (-) or 3\u2032-UTR (+) RNA probes. As the focus of the study was on negative strand RNA synthesis, only the positive sense UTRs and the 5\u2032-UTR (-), which contains the anti-leader TRS important for strand-transfer during discontinuous transcription of negative strands, were included in the screen. The proteins bound to the streptavidin beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using anti-FLAG-HRP antibody. EGFP was also included as a non-binding protein negative control in each screen. For the screen conducted using biotinylated IBV 5\u2032-UTR (+), individual nsps, two fusion proteins, nsp7/8 and nsp8/9, and EGFP were over-expressed in H1299 cells infected with Vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus on 60 mm dishes. Cells were lysed with 250 \u00b5l of Lysis Buffer and used immediately. Biotin pull-down assay was performed with 0.1 \u00b5M (final concentration) biotinylated IBV 5\u2032-UTR (+) probe with 150 \u00b5l cell lysate, and streptavidin beads were used to purify the biotinylated RNA from the mixture. Proteins bound to the beads through interactions with the bound RNA were eluted with 2X SDS loading dye. For Western blot analysis, 10 \u00b5l of cell lysate and all of the eluted proteins were denatured and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Detection of the FLAG-tagged nsps and EGFP were performed with anti-FLAG-HRP and anti-EGFP antibodies, respectively. As shown in\nFig. 7a, proteins that were able to co-purify with the biotinylated probe in the assay were nsp2, nsp10 and to a lesser extent, nsp5.",

This finding adhered to a previous report of nsp2 possibly being a weak antagonist of PKR (X. Wang et al., 2009), which requires double-stranded RNA for activation. The screen also showed that nsp9 and nsp10 only bind to some but not all three probes tested. This is unexpected as both proteins were previously documented to have RNA-binding activities with a non-specific nature (Chen et al., 2009, Egloff et al., 2004, Joseph et al., 2006). This could, however, be explained by the generally weak interactions of these two proteins and the RNA probes that could escape detection in one or more of the screens. The interaction between nsp8 and IBV 3\u2032-UTR (+) may have provided another piece of evidence that nsp8 is heavily involved in viral RNA synthesis, as a RNA-primer synthesizing enzyme for nsp12. It should also be noted that the observed differential interactions of these nsps with UTRs in cells overexpressing these proteins may be due to the fact that the amounts of the over-expressed nsps may be likely rather different from those expressed in virus-infected cells.",

Out of the six nsps which could be detected by the available antisera, nsp3, nsp5, nsp8 and nsp14 were identified as binding partners to nsp12. Nsp8-nsp12 interaction was reported in an ORFeome screen for SARS-CoV (von Brunn et al., 2007).

In this model, the nsp7-nsp8 complex would first synthesize a RNA-primer of a sufficient length, which would be exposed to and binds to the N-terminal region of nsp12, brought in close proximity through its interaction with nsp8. The extension of the RNA chain could then be catalyzed by the polymerase domain in the C-terminal region of nsp12, which would also be oriented in close proximity to the end of the RNA-primer through its interactions at its N-terminal region with nsp8. This arrangement of the two RdRPs would ensure the high efficiency of the replicase complex as the RNA primers synthesized by nsp8 could be utilized by nsp12 immediately for transcription elongation. This putative model is supported by structural studies showing that nsp8 is a very elongated molecule (Xiao et al., 2012), it could be easily spanning the N- and the C-terminal regions of nsp12. Further characterization of the interaction between nsp8 and nsp12 is required to ascertain if the proposed model is valid.

Although nsp2 was not reported to be a RNA-binding protein, it had been demonstrated as a weak antagonist of PKR antagonist (X. Wang et al., 2009), a dsRNA-activated kinase. Although the mechanism of this antagonism has yet to be determined, it is logical to propose that nsp2 might act as a competitive dsRNA-binding protein, preventing PKR from being activated by dsRNA synthesized by the virus during replication and transcription.",

Nsp5 is a 3C-like protease, one of the proteases involved in the proteolytic processing of the replicase gene products. Having no prior reports of it possessing RNA-binding activity, this represents a novel piece of information with regards to the function of nsp5 in addition to its role as a main protease and would warrant further studies.",
