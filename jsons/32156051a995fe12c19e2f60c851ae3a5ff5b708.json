The availability of funding has increased the research on select agents and has created a requirement to validate results in relevant primate models. This review provides a description of current and potential biological threats that are likely to require nonhuman primates for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Primates have been an invaluable resource in the dissection of viral disease pathogenesis as well as in testing vaccine efficacy. DNA vaccine approaches have been studied successfully for Ebola, Lassa, and anthrax in nonhuman primate models. Nonhuman primate research with monkeypox has provided insight into the role of cytokines in limiting disease severity. Biodefense research that has focused on select agents of bacterial origin has also benefited from nonhuman primate studies. Rhesus macaques have traditionally been the model of choice for anthrax research and have yielded successful findings in vaccine development. In plague research, African green monkeys have contributed to vaccine development. However, the disadvantages of current vaccines will undoubtedly require the generation of new vaccines, thus increasing the need for nonhuman primate research. Unfortunately, the current biosafety level (BSL)-3 and BSL-4 facilities equipped to perform this research are limited, which may ultimately impede progress in this era of biodefense.",

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA 1 ) has established new guidelines for testing vaccines and therapeutics of select agents-those pathogens that the government has determined are potential biological weapons. Because the actual risk of infection via a bioterrorist attack is not known, and because naturally occurring infections are quite rare, it is neither ethical nor practical to perform the usual phase 1, 2, and 3 trials. The ability to determine efficacy would be prohibitively expensive because most bioterror agents occur very rarely in nature and our ability to determine efficacy would take years. For this reason, FDA has ruled that stockpiles of vaccines and therapeutics can be generated if the treatment has been determined to be effective in two different animal models. Certainly at least one of the animal models should be a nonhuman primate. Below is a description of the select agents and other emerging pathogens that are likely to require the use of nonhuman primates.",

Numerous species have been used, including baboons, African green monkeys, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques; and the pathology is similar to the infections observed in humans. It will be difficult to conduct vaccine clinical trials in humans for any EBOV vaccines because of the sporadic nature of the outbreaks and the potential ethical difficulty in obtaining approvals. The relatively rare appearance of EBOV does not favor normal development of a commercially viable vaccine. However, this view changes with the newer, existing threats of bioterrorism. If a vaccine became available, it would most likely be given to medical personnel and first responders, similar to those identified at risk from a smallpox attack. It has become clear that rodent models are not necessarily predictive for efficacy of antivirals and other therapeutics, so the gold standard will remain the nonhuman primate trials (Feldmann et al. 2003; Jahrling et al. 1996) . In fact, in a vaccine efficacy study in nonhuman primates, it was demonstrated that vaccine strategies successful in rodents were not able to protect primates from a 1000-plaque forming unit challenge of virus (Geisbert et al. 2002) .",

However, the antiviral ribavirin, which was used as an empirical therapy in infected patients, has been reported to be effective, although it has yet to be fully evaluated in animal experiments (Chong et al. 2001 ). There is a hamster animal model, in which animals die of acute encephalitis following Nipah virus infection (Guillaume et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2003) . The model has shown that passive transfer of antibody from immunized animals protects them from a lethal Nipah virus challenge. In humans, both relapsing and late-onset cases of infection have been observed Tan et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2001 ). In the situations described above, the immunobiology of the infection is unknown. None of these late pathologies have been observed in the hamster model (Guillaume et al. 2004 ). In Bangladesh, there is a current outbreak of Nipah (H. Feldmann, Canadian Center for Human and Animal Health, Winnipeg, Manitoba, personal communication, 2004) , which has been shown to have nosocomial transmissibility .",

Natural human infections occur when individuals handle materials from infected animals or inhale spores associated with animal products (Hanna 1998) . Infection can occur in three forms: cutaneous, inhalation, and gastrointestinal. If left untreated, all forms of the disease can result in death (Meselson et al. 1994) . The most fatal form of the disease, inhalation anthrax, presents with sore throat, mild fever, muscle aches, and malaise. The mortality rate is approximately 50%, even with care that includes the use of antibiotics (Inglesby et al. 2002) . The recent use of this agent as a biological weapon has increased the importance of research focused on postexposure treatment (Inglesby et al. 1999 (Inglesby et al. , 2002 . The rapid onset of death in inhalation anthrax is due to septicemia and toxemia (Dixon et al. 1999 ). The bacterium secretes three proteins: edema factor, lethal factor, and protective antigen (PA 1 ) (Elliott et al. 2000; Miller et al. 1999; Mourez et al. 2003; Wesche et al. 1998) . Lethal toxin and edema toxin exert their effect when they bind the receptorbinding component (PA) of the A-B type toxin (Pezard et al. 1991) . In fact, vaccination strategies have targeted PA in immune responses to prevent coupling of the effector toxin to the receptor-binding component (Welkos et al. 2001 ). PA has also been the focus of therapeutic recombinant antibodies that may eventually be used to treat cases of late-stage anthrax intoxication (Maynard et al. 2002) .",

However, the increasing difficulty in obtaining animals for research has led to the need to develop another model that can sufficiently mimic human infection. Attempts have been made to establish rabbit models and other small animals for inhalation anthrax (Welkos et al. 2001; Zaucha et al. 1998 ), but nonhuman primate models continue to be needed for vaccine efficacy testing and other therapeutic testing. For instance, a survey of the efficacy of the anthrax vaccine adsorbed anthrax vaccine among guinea pigs, rabbits, and rhesus macaques resulted in variable pro-tection when challenged with B. anthracis from diverse geographical origins . Recent studies have shown that cynomologus macaques exhibit pathology similar to that seen in humans and rhesus monkeys (Vasconcelos et al. 2003 ).",

The natural reservoir includes small mammals such as ground squirrels, hares, voles, muskrats, water rats, rabbits, and other rodents (Grunow et al. 2000) . This agent is spread to humans from infected reservoirs and other small vertebrates through direct contact or transmission from an arthropod vector. Tularemia is manifested in various ways, including ulcers at the site of inoculation, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and pneumonia (Ellis et al. 2002) .

Immunization of guinea pigs with the blue variant resulted in increased resistance to lethal challenge (Eigelsbach and Downs 1961) . Ultimately, the current live vaccine strain (LVS 1 ) was derived from this variant, and its efficacy was tested in human volunteers (Saslaw et al. 1961) . Because the basis of the LVS attenuation has not been determined, as well as lack of data regarding the characterization of the immune response, the vaccine is not currently available in the Unites States.

In addition, phase variation appears to play a role in sustaining the viability of the organism within macrophages. Variation in LPS, specifically the O antigen and lipid A, reduces nitric oxide production and permits bacterial growth within macrophages (Cowley et al. 1996) .

The agent causes several forms of the disease, namely bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. Bubonic plague is characterized by swollen tender lymph glands, fever, headache, and chills, and occurs when the bacteria are transmitted by an arthropod vector or when Y. pestis contaminated material enters the body through a break in the skin (Hull et al. 1987; von Reyn et al. 1977) . Septicemic plague, which results when bacteria multiply in the blood, may be a complication of bubonic or pneumonic plague (Hull et al. 1987) . In addition to the symptoms seen with bubonic plague, septicemic patients also present with abdominal pain, shock, and hemorrhaging into skin and internal organs (Hull et al. 1987) . Finally, pneumonic plague is the contagious form of the disease that is spread through aerosolized bacteria (Doll et al. 1994; Meyer 1961) . It is characterized by rapidly developing pneumonia, shortness of breath, cough and chest pain. Infected individuals must be treated within 24 hr to prevent a fatal outcome.",

A major factor that prevents uptake of bacteria by immune scavenger cells is the F1 capsular antigen (Cornelis et al. 1998; Parkhill et al. 2001) . Y. pestis cell wall components, V and W antigen, are lipoprotein complexes that play a role in preventing phagocytosis. The serum resistance observed in plague infections is the result of the short polysaccharide of Y. pestis, which prevents attachment of complement terminal attack complex (Persson et al. 1995) . In addition, murine toxin has been shown to induce shock and respiratory distress in mice that is reminiscent of the human disease (Montie 1981) .",

The vaccine is usually given only to those at risk for encountering a highly pathogenic strain, such as military troops and researchers. Despite the availability of a vaccine, there is interest in developing an improved vaccine because of major disadvantages with current vaccines. Previously, only a sparse number of studies have used African green monkeys and vervets in vaccine and pathogenesis studies of the plague (Chen et al. 1976 (Chen et al. , 1977 Davis et al. 1996) . As new vaccine candidates are identified, the need for a nonhuman primate model will certainly increase.",
