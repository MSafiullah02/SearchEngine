            "text": "Introduction Robotic-assisted bariatric surgery is increasingly performed. There remains controversy about the overall benefit of robotic-assisted (RBS) compared to conventional laparoscopic (LBS) bariatric surgery. In this study, we used a large national risk-stratified bariatric clinical database to compare outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic gastric bypass (RNYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Methods A retrospective analysis of the 2015 and 2016 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Participant Use Data File (PUF) was performed. Primary robotic and laparoscopic RYNGB and SG were analyzed. Descriptive analysis was performed of the unmatched cohorts, followed by 1:3 case-controlled matching. Cases and controls were matched by patient demographics and pre-operative comorbidities, and peri-operative outcomes compared. Results 77,991 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RnYGB) (7.5% robotic-assisted) and 189,503 SG (6.8% robotic-assisted) cases were identified. Operative length was significantly higher in both the robotic-assisted RnYGB and SG cohorts (p < 0.0001). Outcomes were similar between the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic RnYGB cohorts, except a lower mortality rate (p = 0.05), transfusion requirement (p = 0.005), aggregate bleeding (p = 0.04), and surgical site infections (SSI) (p = 0.006) in the robotic-assisted cohort. Outcomes were also similar between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic SG, except for a longer length of stay (p < 0.0001) and higher rates of conversion (p < 0.0001), 30-day intervention (p = 0.01), operative drain present (p < 0.0001), sepsis (p = 0.01), and organ space SSI (p = 0.0002) in the robotic cohort. Bleeding was lower in the robotic SG cohort and mortality was similar. Conclusion Both robotic-assisted and laparoscopic RnYGB and SG are overall very safe. Robotic-assisted gastric bypass is associated with a lower mortality and morbidity; however, a clear benefit for robotic-assisted SG compared to laparoscopic SG was not seen. Given the longer operative and hospital duration, robotic SG is not cost-effective.",

            "text": "Surgical approaches to weight loss continue to evolve. Technologies such as laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgical systems have revolutionized metabolic and bariatric surgery to the point where many of these operations can be performed in an outpatient setting, or require a relatively short hospital length of stay (HLOS). Many studies have compared laparoscopic (LBS) and robotic-assisted (RBS) metabolic and bariatric surgery with varied results [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Baily et al. performed a systematic review and economic analysis that compared laparoscopic and robotic-assisted Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses, and found that complication rates, operative outcomes, and HLOS did not differ significantly between the two surgical approaches [9] . In a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis, Li et al. found that there were no significant differences between conventional laparoscopic (LBS) and robotic-assisted (RBS) metabolic and bariatric surgery in overall post-operative complications, major complications, readmission, conversion, or mortality [10] . They also noted that robotic-assisted cases were associated with longer operative time and HLOS when compared to laparoscopic procedures, in contrast to findings by Bailey et al. [9] . Although this most recent systematic review and meta-analysis included 34 observational studies, only 27,997 patients were included in the meta-analysis. In fact, many of the studies evaluating laparoscopic and robotic-assisted bariatric surgery have been limited by small numbers and have reported mix results. Here, we present one of the largest retrospective case-control studies of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Participant User Files (PUF) database comparing peri-operative outcomes between conventional laparoscopic and robotic-assisted primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RnYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) cases.",

In order to account for surgeon experience as a possible confounder, a second procedure-specific 1:3 case-control match analysis was performed, controlling for operative duration and conversion, as these variables may correlate with surgeon experience-a variable that is missing from the MBSAQIP PUF database. In addition to the patient demographics and pre-operative comorbidities included in the first matched analysis, operative duration and conversion rate were included as matching covariates in the second procedure-specific case-control match analysis.",

            "text": "Post-operative length of stay between the two surgical approaches has also been a point of contention in the literature. In our study, HLOS was similar between the two surgical approaches for gastric bypass before (p = 0.2) and after (p = 0.08) controlling for operative time and conversion rate. Studies have found both shorter HLOS [13, 19] and longer HLOS [16] in robotic-assisted RnYGB cohorts, while others have reported no difference [14, 15] . While our study represents a large 1:3 case-control cohort analysis comparing surgical approaches between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 12,688), and will likely add value to the discussion, the reasons for differences in readmission rates between these two surgical approaches remain unclear and in need of further study. In our case-control matched analysis of robotic and laparoscopic gastric bypass, we found significantly lower rates of mortality (p = 0.05), transfusion (p = 0.005), superficial SSI (p = 0.0003), aggregate bleeding (p = 0.04), and aggregate wound infection (p = 0.006) in the robotic cohort. After controlling for operative time and conversion rate, however, only superficial SSI (p = 0.0002) and aggregate wound infection (p = 0.003) remained lower in the robotic-assisted cohort. Regarding 30-day mortality, others have reported no significant difference between these surgical approaches [4, 9, 10, 12, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , which is consistent with our study once we account for operative length and conversion rate. A lower rate of SSI following roboticassisted compared to conventional laparoscopic gastric bypass has not been previously reported [9, 10, 12-14, 16, 19] . Similar to our findings, Sebastian et al. analyzed the same data set with propensity-score matching and reported higher rates of bleeding following laparoscopic gastric bypass before and after adjusting for operative time and conversion rate [19] . However, once conversion rate and operative length is accounted for in our case-control study, we have shown no difference in transfusion rate between the two surgical approaches (p = 0.1). This trend toward higher transfusion rate with conventional laparoscopic compared to robotic-assisted RnYGB remains unclear. Possible mechanism may include a higher rate of stapled anastomosis with conventional laparoscopic compared to a higher rate of hand-sewn anastomosis with the roboticassisted approach. Surgeons may also be more aggressive in suture hemostasis with the robotic-assisted approach due to easier ergonomics and improved visualization with the robotic platform. These patient level data points are not available in this database, and are worthy of future studies. However, even with a significantly higher operative duration, overall complications were less with the robotic-assisted approach for gastric bypass. In our second matched analysis, controlling for operation duration and conversion, there was much less outcome differences between robotic-assisted gastric bypass and conventional laparoscopic gastric bypass, with similar mortality and morbidity rates.",

            "text": "In our matched analysis of over 35,000 sleeve gastrectomy cases, we found that robotic-assisted SG was associated with significantly longer operative duration (p < 0.0001) and post-operative length of stay (p < 0.0001). These findings are consistent with Sebastian et al. and their analysis of the two surgical approaches in SG, as well as a systematic review and meta-analysis [19, 20] . Most perioperative outcomes were similar between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy cohorts. Some outcomes were more common in the robotic-assisted group, including 30-day intervention (p = 0.01), drain present at 30-day (p < 0.0001), sepsis (p = 0.01) and organ space SSI (p = 0.0002). While we did not find higher rates of readmission and reoperation in our robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy cohort, as did Alizadeh et al. [11] , we similarly found a higher rate of organ space SSI (p = 0.0002). While leak rate was higher in our robotic-assisted cohort, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1), which is similar to other published reports [10, 19, 20] , and in contrast to the significantly higher leak rate noted in the study by Alizadeh et al. [11] . Similar to analysis of our gastric bypass cases, we found a lower rate of transfusion (p = 0.07) and aggregate bleeding complications (p = 0.05) in our robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy cohort. Aggregate renal complications were also noted to be 4.5-fold lower in robotic cohort of patients. The reported higher rates of bleeding complications with laparoscopic compared to robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy remain elusive and require further study. After controlling for operative length and conversion rate in our subsequent 1:3 case-control matched analysis, most outcomes did not change. However, the rate of intra-operative or post-operative transfusion became significantly higher (p = 0.01) in the conventional laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy cohort, which is different from findings in previous studies [10, 11, 19, 20] . Readmissions, re-interventions, operative duration and post-operative HLOS directly contribute to healthcare costs [22] . Many of the studies comparing the cost of conventional laparoscopic versus robotic-assisted surgery do not account for the large initial investment, consumables per procedures, annual maintenance, and other reusable equipment that comprise a substantial portion of the total operating costs of robotic platforms [9, 10, 23] . Because of the growing emphasis on healthcare costs, it is imperative that bariatric surgeons continue to find new and innovative ways to reduce costs associated with the utilization of differently surgical platforms for bariatric surgery without effecting patient outcomes. From our matched analysis, it would appear that even though robotic-assisted RnYGB takes longer, it is associated with better outcomes when compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach, including a lower overall mortality rate, less bleeding complications, and similar leak rates. In contrast, robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy is associated with a higher rate of infectious complications (sepsis and organ space SSI). For both gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, the robotic platform seems to be protective of aggregate bleeding complications and transfusion requirements, but more so for gastric bypass cases. These findings remained, though less significant, after controlling for operation length and conversion as surrogate variables for surgeon experience. This suggest that the potential benefits of robotic-assisted metabolic and bariatric surgery noted in this study most likely represents an interplay between the surgical platform and surgeon experience.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to our study. First, this study was limited to peri-operative outcomes data only. Stratified outcomes on weight loss, long-term complications, and surgical impact on comorbid conditions could not be assessed. Second, this dataset does not provide relevant surgeon and surgical technique variables that may impact peri-operative outcomes. Surgeon experience or case volume has been shown to have a considerable effect on outcomes [14, 16] and is a variable that is missing from the data set. We attempted to control for this potential confounder by including operative length and conversion rate as matching covariates. There are limitations to using operation length and conversion as surrogate variables for surgeon experience, as there are other patient variables and intra-operative variables that may impact operative length and the likelihood of conversion. A more accurate representation of surgeon experience is needed in the MBSAQIP database to account for this possible confounder. The data also lack information on surgical technique variables between the two cohorts that could have also impacted outcomes. The portion of anastomosis created with a purely hand-sewn, stapled, or a combination of techniques is unknown. With the introduction of the robotic stapler, it is unclear how surgeon's anastomotic technique on the robotic platform may have changed and impacted outcomes. It is possible that higher rates of organ space SSI and post-operative sepsis seen in SG using the robotic-assisted surgical approach represent surgeon's early learning curve or changes in technique as technology evolves. There is likely significant intra-operative variation in technique between the two surgical approaches that is not accounted for in the database, and limits a true assessment on outcomes between laparoscopic and robotic-assisted Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. As robotic platforms become more common, it is important to continue to critically assess these surgeon and surgical technique variables and their impact on outcomes. Lastly, even though this is the largest bariatric clinical database available, this is a retrospective analysis and is therefore vulnerable to biases associated with retrospective analysis of clinical databases. While we had a large volume of clinical data to analyze, there were missing data points. Data entry is limited by the timeliness and completeness of data entry by bariatric Clinical Nurse Reviewers. Given the missing data points, this is currently not a 100% capture of relevant clinical data and limits any analysis utilizing this database.",

            "text": "This study represents the largest case-control matched analyses of the MBSAQIP PUF database comparing these two surgical approaches for gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Both platforms are overall very safe. The roboticassisted platform is associated with longer operative duration. In spite of the longer operative time, we conclude that the robotic-assisted approach is safe and may provide some advantage for primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, as it is associated with less complication compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach. In contrast, the benefits of robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy remain unclear. Our analysis suggest that it is likely less cost-effective due to longer operative duration, post-operative length stay, and 30-days intervention. It may also be less safe due to higher rates of post-operative sepsis and drains present at 30-days, and a tendency toward a higher leak rate. The robotic platform seems to be protective of bleeding complications for both gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, but may mitigate post-operative bleeding complications more in gastric bypass compared to sleeve gastrectomy cases and subsequently impact peri-operative mortality and morbidity. Further studies are warranted to better understand the costeffectiveness and safety of these surgical platforms, while addressing some of the limitations of this dataset. Surgeons need to remain safety-and cost-conscious when deciding which platform to use in performing primary metabolic and bariatric surgery. ",
