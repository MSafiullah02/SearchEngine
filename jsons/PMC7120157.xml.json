Treatment options for these patients range from observation to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but all patients are more susceptible to infection. The problem of infection is dynamic with continued shifts in pathogenic organisms and microbial susceptibilities, new treatment regimens that further diminish immune function, and patients receiving treatment who are now older and frailer. The classic patterns of immunodeficiency for patients with a hematological malignancy include: periods of profound neutropenia, increased iatrogenic risks (i.e., central vascular catheters), and cellular immune suppression that affects HSCT recipients, patients with lymphoid malignancies, and those receiving treatment with corticosteroids or agents like alemtuzumab [1\u20134]. Recent advances in antimicrobial drug development, new technology, clinical trial results, and further clinical experience have enhanced the database on which to make infection prophylaxis and treatment decisions. However, the practicing clinician must remember that the majority of basic infection management principles for patients who are neutropenic remain unchanged.",

Neutropenia is primarily a consequence of the patients\u2019 underlying disease or treatment, although infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus [CMV], human herpes virus [HHV]-6, HHV-8, parvovirus B19), medication toxicity (e.g., ganciclovir, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, linezolid), or graft rejection following HSCT are also important etiologies. Patients with neutropenia are immune compromised because of the absence of circulating neutrophils, plus the enhanced ability of the patient\u2019s endogenous colonizing flora to invade disrupted mucosal and skin barriers and cause infection [1, 2, 9, 10]. Infection risks are further increased when periods of neutropenia are prolonged because of delayed posttreatment marrow recovery, inadequate antitumor responses, or a relapse of their disease [1, 2]. The primary sites of infection are limited and include the alimentary tract (i.e., mouth, pharynx, esophagus, large and small bowel, and rectum), sinuses, lungs, and skin. Febrile episodes that occur during periods of neutropenia should be considered infection, but depending on the clinical study more than 40\u201380 % of such febrile episodes will not have an infecting pathogen identified [1, 2, 11\u201313].",

Seventy-two percent of these infections occurred during periods of neutropenia, and more than half were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci.

Hand washing, while effective, continues to be difficult to fully implement, and the maintenance of a high level of compliance remains a significant challenge [38]. Hand soap that contains chlorhexidine is recommended, and adds residual antimicrobial effect to the mechanical cleansing that occurs with the physical washing. Antimicrobial hand rubs can be used if soap, water, and sinks are not easily accessible. Alcohol-containing waterless products appear to be well tolerated and effective, but antimicrobial resistance among C. difficile has been reported [39]. Gloves when worn should be put on after entering a patient\u2019s room and the hand washing is complete. Gloves should never be used for more than one patient contact. Keeping staff and patient visitors who have respiratory symptoms (e.g., uncontrolled cough and respiratory secretions, conjunctivitis, systemic symptoms) from contact with high-risk patients may decrease the risk of patients acquiring a serious respiratory viral infection. One must remember in constructing isolation approaches that the modes of transmission of respiratory virus infections are both respiratory and direct patient contact. Annual vaccination of healthcare workers against viral influenza is important and strongly recommended.",

The potential for bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolone-based chemoprophylaxis remains a substantial concern [59\u201365], and individual cancer centers have reported rising rates of resistance with the use of fluoroquinolones [58, 59, 61, 65]. High utilization of fluoroquinolones in oncology patients has been linked to increases in infections due to fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci, and E. coli and C. difficile enterocolitis, but recent meta-analyses could not confirm this later association [47, 58, 61, 66, 67]. In two centers, discontinuing routine fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for patients with hematological malignancy led to the prompt reduction in bacterial resistance rates and these changes had no significant impact on infection-related morbidity [61, 63].",

These combinations are associated with increased rates of gastrointestinal toxicity, and persistent breakthrough infections with resistant gram-\u00adpositive pathogens have resulted in diminished enthusiasm for this approach [45, 46].",

Fluconazole usage has changed the epidemiology of candidemia with a dramatic decrease in infections due to C. albicans, but a progressive increase in Candida species (C. glabrata and C. krusei) that are more resistant to fluconazole [37, 81]. The threshold incidence of candida infection where fluconazole prophylaxis appears efficacious is in the range of 6\u201310 % [76\u201378]. Candida infection rates at this level are consequently seen among patients with hematological malignancy who experience prolonged neutropenia and receive intensive chemotherapy that induces severe oral and GI mucositis. However, invasive candidiasis among lower-risk patient populations is rare, and likely does not merit routine fluconazole prophylaxis [11\u201313, 72].",

This antifungal prophylactic benefit has not been established for postremission consolidation therapy for acute leukemia, and thus is not routinely recommended. Posaconazole, when compared as antifungal prophylaxis to itraconazole or fluconazole among adult and adolescent patients (>13 years of age) receiving induction chemotherapy for AML or intensive treatment for advanced MDS, was associated with more serious adverse events, but significantly decreased aspergillus infections and improved patient survival [85]. The prophylactic benefit of voriconazole for high-risk patients with hematological malignancies has been inferred from studies of voriconazole in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation, and only one randomized study in patients with AML or MDS has been performed [93].",

The justification for this prolonged prophylaxis is based on the understanding that there are three distinct periods of risk for invasive mold infections post allogeneic transplant [95]. The first period is during the preengraftment neutropenic phase; the second is during the postengraftment period when patients are at highest risk to develop acute and or chronic GVHD that requires immunosuppressive treatment, and the third occurs late after transplant among patients with delayed immune reconstitution and persistent chronic GVHD. Fluconazole while an effective prophylactic antifungal agent for allogeneic HSCT recipients lacks anti-mold coverage and thus its prophylactic efficacy is restricted to preventing invasive candida infections [74, 75, 82]. However, allogeneic HSCT patients are also at risk for invasive molds, and thus it stands to reason that antifungal agents with activity against molds would provide enhanced prophylaxis, and potentially improve patient outcomes and survival.",

In recent years, antibiotic-resistant pathogens have become more common, and now pose a significant new challenge for neutropenic and other hospitalized patients [120\u2013122]. Routine empiric coverage of all bacteria is not possible, and therefore the aim should be to provide empiric coverage for the most common and the most virulent pathogens. This may be accomplished with a variety of antibiotic regimens, but the ultimate selection of a particular empiric antibiotic regimen should continue to be based on the risk status of the patient (high vs. low-risk), localizing signs or symptoms of infection such as pneumonia, enteritis, or cellulitis, and the local institution and \u00adindividual patient patterns of bacterial resistance and colonization.",

            "text": "Many centers have found that ceftazidime has become a less reliable agent for empiric monotherapy of fever and neutropenia because of its decreasing activity against gram-negative organisms, and many gram-positive pathogens such as streptococci [124, 125]. Aminoglycoside monotherapy should not be used for either empiric coverage or pathogen-directed therapy during neutropenia because of the rapid emergence of microbial resistance to this class of agents. Ciprofloxacin monotherapy is not an adequate treatment for febrile neutropenic patients because of its weak activity against gram-positive organisms, especially viridans streptococci [126, 127]. The combination of vancomycin or clindamycin plus ciprofloxacin may be a suitable alternative for \u03b2-lactam-allergic patients [66]. Double \u03b2-lactam regimens are discouraged due to concerns about increased expense and toxicity, and the lack of consistent added clinical benefit [128, 129]. Cefepime remains an acceptable monotherapy for empiric coverage of febrile neutropenia. A meta-analysis by Yahav and colleagues previously reported an increased 30-day mortality with cefepime treatment (RR 1.41, 95 % CI 1.08\u20131.84) [130]. This study raised doubt about the efficacy of the drug, and prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to undertake a second comprehensive meta-analysis, using an expanded dataset [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafety]. The FDA study found no statistically significant increase in 30-day mortality with cefepime (RR 1.20, 95 % CI 0.82\u20131.76), and thus cefepime continues to be a reliable first-line agent for empiric antibiotic coverage for fever and neutropenia.",

Oral ulcerations or symptoms of esophagitis may represent herpes simplex or Candida esophagitis in high-risk patients, so empiric additions of acyclovir and/or fluconazole or other antifungal agents are appropriate. The onset of severe abdominal pain, typically in the right lower quadrant, suggests neutropenic enterocolitis (also referred to as \u201ctyphlitis\u201d). A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be obtained for additional evaluation [157, 158]. Since anaerobes and gram-negative organisms predominate in causing neutropenic enterocolitis, monotherapy with piperacillin\u2013tazobactam or a carbapenem, or a combination of an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin plus metronidazole, are appropriate antibiotic regimens. There is less evidence for routine additions of vancomycin or an antifungal agent, but should be considered if the patient is hemodynamically unstable [11, 13].

However, immediate catheter removal is recommended for those patients with BSI caused by fungi, nontuberculosis mycobacterium (M. fortuitum complex and M. chelonae/abscessus group), and VRE because of the consistent lack of infection response until this device is discontinued [11, 13, 159]. Persistent BSI are also more frequent if the catheter is not removed when the bloodstream pathogen is a Bacillus sp., C. jeikeium, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [11, 13, 159]. Most other BSI can initially be treated with pathogen-specific antibiotics, but catheter removal should be considered when the BSI persists beyond 48 h and no other site of infection is identified. One additional caveat is that the CVC should be considered a potential site of infection for those bacteremias that recur shortly after completing a course of antibiotics [159].",

The most useful diagnostic tool for attempting to diagnose a CRBSI is the differential time to positivity (DPT) of blood cultures drawn simultaneously through the catheter and peripheral vein [159, 162\u2013165]. Quantitative blood cultures have also been recommended in the past, but they are not routinely recommended because of their cost and limited clinical utility [159]. The premise of the DPT test is that if the catheter is the source of the BSI then the concentration of organisms in the catheter will be higher than in the peripheral blood, and blood cultures drawn from the CVC will become positive more quickly. Studies suggest that a CVC blood culture that becomes positive at least 120 min earlier than a simultaneously drawn peripheral vein blood indicates the catheter to be the likely source of infection [165]. Once antibiotics have been started, DPT testing is likely less reliable.",

Resolutions of fever in patients who are neutropenic are often delayed. Elting et al. reviewed 488 episodes of fever and neutropenia. The median time to fever resolution ranged from 5 to 7 days, and less than 40 % of patients became afebrile before day 5 of therapy [168]. Patients with gram-negative BSI were febrile longer (mean, 6.6\u20138.2 days), and the time to fever defervescence was even longer for patients with gram-positive BSI (mean, 6.6\u201312.4 days). These results are consistent with the findings published by Freifeld et al. who reported that fever persisted a mean of 4 days with ceftazidime therapy, and 3 days when patients were treated with imipenem [169]. Thus, fevers maybe prolonged even when patient is clinically improved, but fever response varies depending upon the specific antibiotic regimen, the site of infection, and the infecting pathogen.",

At greatest risk are those patients treated for acute myelogenous leukemia for which the incidence of invasive mold infections is 20 times more frequent than what is reported for patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma [175]. Clinical manifestations of occult fungal infection are nonspecific, and because diagnosis of invasive fungal infections is especially difficult, empiric antifungal therapy instituted for persistent neutropenic fever has been the standard approach for several decades [1, 2, 171]. Using these very broad and nonspecific criteria, approximately 22\u201334 % of neutropenic cancer patients may receive antifungal treatment, but only about 4 % of such patients will ever have an invasive fungal infection identified [176\u2013181]. The choice of empiric antifungal agent must consider not only the most likely fungal pathogens, but also toxicities of the therapy and cost. If antifungal prophylaxis has not been given, then an invasive candida infection is the most likely explanation. For patients receiving fluconazole prophylaxis, fluconazole-resistant candida infections, such as C. krusei or C. glabrata, or an invasive mold infection, are the most common pathogens.",

There are insufficient data upon which to base a specific empiric antifungal recommendation for patients already receiving mold-active prophylaxis, but a switch to an IV anti-mold agent within a different antifungal class seems prudent.

When galactomannan tests in this trial did become positive, this occurred a median of only 2 days before the infection was clinically detected [96].

Maertens et al. used serial serum galactomannan tests and early CT scanning combined with a preemptive treatment algorithm [193]. The preemptive treatment approach resulted in a decrease in the need for empiric antifungal treatment from 35 % vs. 8 %, and overall patient survival was similar to that reported with empiric antifungal therapy. More recently, Cordonnier et al. performed a randomized trial that suggests that preemptive antifungal therapy may be potentially a safe alternative to empiric antifungal therapy, for a select group of high-risk neutropenic patients that does not include allogeneic transplant recipients [194]. Preemptive therapy in this trial was initiated for clinical symptoms, a chest CT scan that suggested an invasive fungal infection, and/or mycological evidence such as Aspergillus colonization or a positive galactomannan test. Overall survival was similar for both treatment groups, but there were more episodes of invasive fungal infections and a trend toward more fungal-related deaths in those patients treated with preemptive therapy. Finally, Hebart and colleagues compared empiric antifungal therapy versus PCR-driven preemptive antifungal therapy in patients receiving anti-yeast prophylaxis after allogeneic stem cell transplant [195]. This study demonstrated an increased use of antifungal therapy, and a reduced 30-day mortality in the PCR-driven arm, but no differences were reported in the incidence of invasive fungal infections or 100-day survival.",

The incidence of candidiasis has been well documented both before and after the routine use of azole antifungal prophylaxis [37]. Viscoli and coworkers reported the occurrence of candidemia in cancer patients [206]. The overall 30-day mortality rate for infected patients was 39 %, and the factors of increased age and stage of disease, the occurrence of septic shock, and the lack of antifungal prophylaxis were associated with an increase in infection-associated death [206]. C. albicans was the most common species identified, but the recovery of nonalbicans species was increased in patients with a hematological malignancy who had received azole prophylaxis. Goodrich and colleagues reported that invasive candida infections occurred in 14 % of transplant recipients before fluconazole prophylaxis was routinely being used. C. albicans (62 %) and C. tropicalis (21 %) were the most commonly isolated species, the median time to the development of a Candida spp. BSI was 15 days after transplantation, and these infections had an attributable mortality of 39 % that increased to 88 % when patients had documented Candida tissue invasion [70]. The incidence of invasive candida infections following the introduction of fluconazole prophylaxis decreased to 4.7 %. Infections occurred later after transplant (median of 28 days after transplantation), and they were associated with a slightly lower (20 %) mortality rate [37]. Nonalbicans Candida species were more likely to be isolated with C. glabrata, and C. krusei being most common. C. albicans resistance to fluconazole was modest and identified among 5.3 % of C. albicans isolates [37].",

Most new antifungal agents are reported to provide success response rates of 55\u201365 %, but the clinical outcome of these infections is highly dependent on neutrophil recovery [209\u2013214]. The IDSA now recommend that an echinocandidin (e.g., caspofungin, anidulafungin, or micafungin) or lipid formulation of amphotericin B be utilized as a first-line therapy for most invasive candida infections [207]. Duration of therapy is dependent on the patient\u2019s disease and neutrophil recovery, but minimum therapy for uncomplicated infections is 2 weeks after documented clearance of candida from the blood and resolution of infection-associated symptoms [11\u201313, 215].",

The second period of infection spans day 40\u2013120 posttransplantation when patients suffer from a cellular immune defect induced primarily by acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and/or the immunosuppressant therapy needed to control GVHD.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of aspergillus infections among patients with a hematological malignancy treated with conventional therapy are similar to HSCT recipients [35]. Pulmonary involvement is seen in most cases (87 %), infection of the sinuses/nose occurs in 16 % of cases, and dissemination to the brain occurs in 8 % of infected patients [35, 216, 217].

Diagnosis is dependent on a high index of suspicion and recovery of the infecting organism by histology or microbiology from tissue specimens or pulmonary or sinus lavage. Results of galactomannan assays as a tool for early detection are controversial but a positive result has been associated with high specificity [203]. While surveillance cultures are no longer utilized, the isolation of A. fumigatus or flavus in respiratory specimens or nasal secretions has been shown to be highly predictive of present or future invasive aspergillus infections [1, 2]. Mucosal eschars along the nasal septum are important clinical clues to the diagnosis of aspergillus sinusitis. Biopsy and culture of such lesions are always indicated. If nasal lesions are not observed, but CT scans show sinusitis, then sinus lavage and biopsy may establish the presence of fungal pathogens and preclude the need for further diagnostic procedures.",

Early this decade Herbecht et al. studied patients with hematological malignancy and HSCT recipients who were infected with aspergillus.

Voriconazole recipients had improved survival (71 % vs. 58 %) and improved overall infection response rates (53 % vs. 32 %). Even more important was the finding that voriconazole efficacy was maintained for infected patients with persistent neutropenia or for allogeneic transplant recipients. Voriconazole-associated toxicity was less than what was seen with amphotericin B desoxycolate, and now voriconazole is the recommended first-line therapy for aspergillosis.",

The clinical presentations of these different molds are quite similar, and one factor that has been identified as a risk factor for zygomycosis is voriconazole prophylaxis or treatment. Most experts believe that empiric treatment that is to be directed primarily against aspergillosis should consist of voriconazole [222, 223]. Voriconazole has a much lower toxicity profile than amphotericin B products, and unlike posaconazole is available in both an oral and IV formulation. Unfortunately, voriconazole lacks antimicrobial activity against zygomycosis and for patients already receiving voriconazole the clinician must then consider the need for empiric coverage of zygomycetes [233\u2013235]. The decision to prescribe treatment directed against zygomycosis has in the past relied exclusively on an amphotericin B products, but posaconazole maybe now a more attractive treatment alternative for such infections [235, 236].",

Invasive mold infections may progress quickly during periods of neutropenia, and thus despite the lack of definitive prospective data the concept of empiric combination antifungal therapy has become clinically attractive but remains controversial [237\u2013239]. Evidence from animal studies of invasive aspergillosis suggests that the combination of an azole and echinocandin is superior to treatment with an azole alone. Retrospective clinical studies in humans also provide some additional support for combination therapy [237\u2013239]. The primary arguments against combination therapy rest with concern about toxicity and cost. Despite these issues many experts frequently will prescribe initial treatment with voriconazole plus caspofungin, or liposomal amphotericin B and caspofungin [240]. Combination of agents from all three classes (an azole, amphotericin B, and echinocandin) of antifungal therapy could be combined, but there are animal model and laboratory data that suggest potential antagonism when such combinations are utilized. To date there are no clinical data that support or refute such combination treatment.",

However, clinical availability of voriconazole and posaconazole serum levels in many centers is limited, and thus some experts just increase the administered daily voriconazole or posaconazole dose, or switch to IV voriconazole therapy when there is concern about a patient\u2019s clinical response or a patient\u2019s absorption of oral medications is questioned.",

This is even more important as we have to consider pathogen-specific therapy for infections caused by pathogens like the zygomycetes. Amphotericin B desoxycolate and lipid formulation products have been the gold standard for the treatment of zygomycosis, but clinical results have been very disappointing [222, 235]. Some experts believe that the poor clinical response with amphotericin B therapy is a reflection of insufficient dosage, but randomized studies have reported that 10 mg/kg/day of liposomal amphotericin B to be no more effective than 3 mg/kg/day when treating confirmed mold infections [240]. Posaconazole has activity against many of the zygomycetes, and based on early anecdotal experience suggesting success makes posaconazole therapy a potentially attractive and less toxic alternative to amphotericin B treatment [236].",

Such combination therapy with cyclosporine and tacrolimus can be challenging, but schemes that define appropriate dose adjustment have been developed that allows the successful co-administration of azole antifungal agents and some of the calcineurin inhibitors when frequent monitoring of serum levels is incorporated into the patient\u2019s clinical care. The more difficult clinical scenario is the management of patients who are to receive concomitant voriconazole or posaconazole and sirolimus. There is a package insert \u201cblack box warning\u201d that emphasizes the deleterious interaction between these drugs, and it is well known that voriconazole therapy significantly increases the serum levels of sirolimus [243]. Yet, the need to prescribe voriconazole/posaconazole for some patients receiving sirolimus is critical. Thus it is suggested that by reducing the sirolimus dose by 90 % and carefully monitoring serum levels, these agents can be successfully co-administrated.",

Authoritative evidence-based guidelines have indicated that clinical benefits from prophylactic CSFs accrue when the risk of neutropenic fever associated with a chemotherapy regimen is 20 % or greater, unless the cancer treatment is symptomatic or palliative, or when dose reduction is the clinically appropriate approach [246\u2013248]. Due to the high cost of CSFs, it is not clear that CSF prophylaxis given widely to all patients at the threshold of 20 % risk of fever and neutropenia is cost-effective for all healthcare markets [249\u2013251]. If societal costs are considered, the economic impact of fever and neutropenia becomes more apparent, and it may be easier to recognize the cost-saving benefits of CSFs [251]. Primary prophylaxis\u2014the use of CSFs for prevention in the first cycle of treatment for many lymphoid hematological malignancies\u2014does appear to reduce the incidence of fever and neutropenia and is likely to be most cost-effective. Primary CSF prophylaxis should not routinely be administered to patients with myeloid hematological malignancies. CSF prophylaxis should be preferentially considered for older patients, or if patients have additional infection risk factors, including prior episodes of fever and neutropenia, poor nutritional or performance status, no antibiotic prophylaxis, significant co-morbid medical conditions, or other modifying disease characteristics that suggests there is substantial risk of fever and/or severe infection during neutropenia [252\u2013254]. Treatment with CSFs is not recommended when the risk of fever and neutropenia is 10 % or less. If given, CSF treatment should be started immediately after the chemotherapy is completed.",
