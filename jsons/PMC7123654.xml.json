Molecular amplification is greatly complicated by the presence of a complex and abundant gut microflora and high concentrations of potential PCR inhibitors in diarrheal stool specimens [1]. Approaches to reduce PCR inhibition include dilution of extracted nucleic acids, treatment of samples with chelating agents (Chelex 100, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), or adding detergents or denaturing chemicals during extraction. Inclusion of amplification facilitators such as bovine serum albumin or betaine also can increase amplification and overcome low levels of contaminants that co-purify with nucleic acids. Due to the high number of possible enteric pathogens with common clinical presentations, multiplexed molecular tests are advantageous. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared molecular tests are available for some gastrointestinal pathogens in single test or multiplex formats.",

Clinical laboratories generally use a limited set of media to recover the most common bacterial pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter) and other culture media are used to identify less common agents on special request (e.g., based on travel history, exposure, etc.). Culture and identification of enteric pathogens is cost-effective but can take several days to provide a diagnosis. Culture has some limitations and it is especially difficult to distinguish nonpathogenic from pathogenic strains of E. coli. Recent recommendations suggest that, because of the variety of serotypes and difficulty of distinguishing pathogenic forms from normal flora, laboratories should detect enterotoxigenic E. coli using immunoassays that detect the toxin in addition to culture [2].",

Since bacterial gastroenteritis can involve groups of people and a common food source, definitive identification of an etiologic agent can be helpful in prompting epidemiologic investigation and testing of potentially contaminated food by public health laboratories. Current stool culture-based tests for bacterial gastrointestinal pathogens typically require several day turnaround times and may yield poor results, especially if a patient has received antibiotic therapy.

Epidemiologic studies revealed a high percentage of cases were caused by a strain referred to as BI/NAP1/027, named in reference to typing results for restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and PCR-ribotyping, respectively. The BI/NAP1/027 strain carries 18-bp and 1-bp (nt 117) deletions within the tcdC gene, and these deletions are speculated to result in the formation of an abnormal tcdC protein with a loss of regulatory function [13]. The resultant loss of negative regulation may lead to an increase in toxin formation and greater virulence [13]. Supporting this theory is the observation that isolates of the BI/NAP1/027 strain produce increased amounts of toxin A and B in vitro [15]. An additional toxin known as the binary toxin CDT is present in the BI/NAP1/027 strain as well as 6 % of C. difficile isolates, and is encoded by two chromosomal genes, cdtA and cdtB, located outside of the PaLoc [13]. Although production of the binary toxin is associated with the more virulent BI/NAP1/027 strain, its role in pathogenesis is not well established [8, 16].",

The diversity of tests available makes possible a number of diagnostic algorithms. None of these testing strategies has performed optimally to date, leading a number of investigators to suggest the adoption of the highly sensitive and specific PCR-based assays. Several studies have evaluated the effects of implementing nucleic acid testing. Algorithms examined include PCR assays as confirmatory tests of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)-positive samples, as reflex tests for GDH-positive, toxin-enzyme immunoassays (EIA) negative samples, and as stand-alone assays for direct testing of stool samples. A comparison of these testing algorithms to those using toxin-EIA only, GDH followed by toxin-EIA, and GDH/toxin-EIA followed by cell culture cytotoxin neutralization (CCCN) testing of toxin-EIA negative samples indicates a clear trade-off between sensitivity and cost [17]. The cost per test for all strategies using PCR-based assays was significantly greater than the most expensive non-PCR-based testing algorithm ($35.22 vs $24.41, respectively) [17]. However, strategies using PCR as confirmation of GDH-positive samples or as a reflex test for GDH-positive, toxin-EIA negative samples detected an additional 89 toxigenic C. difficile samples over a 1 year period that were missed by algorithms using traditional testing methods [17]. Furthermore, stand-alone, direct PCR testing of stool samples detected an additional 138 positive specimens missed by even the most sensitive non-PCR-based testing algorithm. Importantly, all diagnostic strategies using PCR provided results for the majority of samples (>83.7 %) in less than 1 h and in less than 5 h for the remainder [17]. These rapid turnaround times are in contrast to algorithms relying on CCCN as a reflex test for GDH-positive, toxin-EIA negative samples, which required as long as 48 h for 12.3 % of samples tested [17].",

In addition, rapid detection allows for the timely institution of treatment and possibly shortened hospital stays.

The results confirm the poor performance of strategies relying solely on GDH/toxin-EIA testing as the number of patients placed in isolation with true CDI nearly matches the numbers of patients without the disease [16]. Furthermore, 45 patients with CDI are not identified, and therefore, are not placed into proper infection control isolation [16]. Algorithms that reflex to toxigenic culture or CCCN after GDH/toxin-EIA testing detect more cases of CDI, but still produce high numbers of false-positive results (55 patients). Using toxigenic culture as a reflex test produced values for sensitivity and specificity statistically equivalent to PCR-based reflex testing; however, the length of time required to produce final results would likely lead to excessive costs. Using PCR-based assays as stand-alone tests detected the greatest number of CDI cases (95 %), and led to the unnecessary isolation of only 36 patients [16]. While these results further confirm the superior diagnostic performance of nucleic acid testing either as a reflex test for GDH-positive, toxin-EIA negative samples or as a stand-alone method, the authors of the study recommend additional investigations examining the cost-effectiveness of these strategies [16].",

EIA tests are available for the detection of GDH, a constitutively expressed enzyme produced by nearly all C. difficile strains as well as some non-C. difficile Clostridium sp. [16, 26]. These GDH EIAs demonstrate sensitivities of greater than 90 %, and diagnostic algorithms often use these assays as initial screening tests [26]. However, GDH EIAs detect both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains, and GDH-positive samples must be confirmed with an assay demonstrating toxin production. Options for confirmation include toxigenic culture, CCCN, and toxin-EIAs. However, due to the low sensitivities of CCCN and toxin-EIAs, a number of cases would likely be missed.",

Several tests are US FDA-cleared, and additional assays will likely become commercially available in the near future. At this time all US FDA-cleared assays are qualitative, although quantitative testing is technologically possible with real-time PCR. Most US FDA-cleared assays are based on real-time PCR. However, other novel methods such as helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) also are employed. In addition, the majority of commercially available real-time PCR assays target solely the tcdB gene. US FDA-cleared multiplex PCR assays target tcdB as well as variable tcdA, tcdC, and cdt gene sequences and the single base pair deletion at nucleotide 117 in the tcdC gene associated with the 027/NAP1/B1 strain. Initial studies evaluating these US FDA-cleared assays are promising; however, the 2010 Update by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the Infectious Diseases Society of America stated the need for further studies before recommending molecular assays for routine testing [8]. Lastly, CDI screening also may be performed using the US FDA-cleared xTAG\u00ae Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (Luminex Corporation), a multiplex test that simultaneously detects 11 gastrointestinal pathogens including C. difficile and other major bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Published reports evaluating the US FDA-cleared version of this assay are currently lacking.",

Although most toxigenic C. difficile strains contain an intact tcdB gene, the detection of a strain deficient in at least a portion of the tcdB gene is reported in a case of recurrent CDI [32, 33]. While the report of a clinically significant tcdB deficient strain reinforces the need to be vigilant for the development of tcdB-negative, tcdA-positive strains affecting the clinical performance of toxin B PCR assays, the occurrence of such variant strains is currently rare [22, 33]. Multiplex real-time PCR assays, with the ability to simultaneously detect several different sequence targets (e.g., tcdA and tcdB, cdtA, cdtB, and tcdC) may decrease the likelihood of detection failure due to primer sequence mismatches [23].",

These vague and chronic symptoms may last an average of 6 years before clinical signs more characteristic of the disease appear [38]. Atypical cases lacking classic gastrointestinal symptoms and involving the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system (CNS) as well as other organ sites may occur in up to 15 % of those affected [38].

Biopsies obtained from other anatomic sites demonstrating macrophages filled with PAS-positive material are even less specific, and must be interpreted with caution [37, 40, 44]. Immunohistochemistry for T. whipplei performed on paraffin-embedded tissues has recently been developed and has greatly improved both the sensitivity and specificity of histological diagnosis [38].

Real-time PCR assays may also improve patient care by offering quantitative results. High bacterial densities are associated with lower eradication rates, and, therefore, quantitative measurements by real-time PCR may be used to identify patients who could benefit from a modified, more intense treatment regimen [65]. In addition, PCR-based assays for the detection of H. pylori DNA in fecal specimens represent potentially simple and noninvasive methods for establishing the existence of infection and for proving successful eradication.

The lack of a clear association has prevented development of clinical guidelines recommending testing of these pathogenic factors for patient care [75].",

Other genes targeted include the sequences encoding the 26-kDa species-specific protein antigen (SSA) and heat shock protein (HSP60), as well as random H. pylori genome sequences. Sensitivity and specificity of the assays are determined largely by target gene and primer choice, but also depend on the type of PCR method. Conventional PCR assays provide qualitative results and perform the same or better than conventional detection methods [58].

An assay described by Gibson et al. uses fluorescent-labeled probes complementary to the clarithromycin-sensitive 23S rRNA gene sequence [86]. Resistance mutations result in mismatched bases between the probe and target, and melting curve analysis reveals a lower peak melting temperature for the mismatched hybrid than a fully complementary probe and target hybrid [86]. This assay has good concordance with culture-based methods [66, 84], but also identified susceptibilities for an additional 28 patients whose cultures were negative. Of the 28 additional susceptibility results rendered, 21 had resistance genotypes. Another assay design using a biprobe system was tested on 200 patients who failed eradication therapy. The assay detected resistance genotypes with a sensitivity and specificity of 98.4 % and 94.1 %, respectively, when compared to culture-based testing [85]. Clarithromycin-resistant genotypes can also be detected in stool samples using real-time PCR methods; however, the sensitivity is lower [87]. Real-time PCR assays have also been developed to detect point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene resulting in resistance to ciprofloxacin and point mutations in the 16S rRNA gene conferring decreased susceptibility and resistance to tetracyclines [88, 89]. The assay for determining fluoroquinolone resistance identifies mutations using two hybridization biprobes designed to detect the most frequently occurring mutations at amino acid positions 87 or 91 [88]. Tetracycline resistance is detected using 16S rDNA primers and a fluorescently labeled probe complementary to the wild-type 16S rDNA allele. In both assays, melting curve analysis differentiates amplicons with resistance mutations from those with wild-type sequences [89]. While various mutations in the NADPH nitroreductase gene (rdxA) are associated with metronidazole resistance, detection of these mutations is not a reliable indicator of resistance [90].",

Visualization of the characteristic bacterial forms may be difficult when reduced numbers of bacteria are present, such as when biopsies are obtained after eradication therapy or if the patient has been on long-term acid suppression therapy with PPIs. These same conditions may change the typical morphology of H. pylori from a comma or S-shaped bacillus to a coccoidal form, obscuring a visual diagnosis. Several studies using fluorescently labeled, species-specific probes have demonstrated the ability of FISH to reliably detect H. pylori [91, 92]. Additionally, clarithromycin-resistant strains also can be detected using FISH performed on formalin-fixed tissue sections [92]. Fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide probes designed to detect the most common mutations determining clarithromycin resistance are both sensitive and specific when compared to culture-based susceptibility testing [91]. FISH testing, however, may produce results more rapidly than culture.",

However, due to the high sensitivity of PCR-based methods and the amplification of DNA from nonviable organisms, isolated positive PCR results in the post-treatment period must be interpreted with caution. Positive results in this setting may represent continued presence of organisms at low levels or nonviable organisms, and, therefore, PCR may not have utility in determining eradication failures in the post-treatment period. Isolated positive PCR results in untreated patients may reflect true infection with a low H. pylori density, but may also be due to nonspecific amplification of non-H. pylori bacterial DNA [93].

While negative PCR results within 12 days of treatment were obtained for a small group of infected patients, another study demonstrated false-positive results occurring in half the patients 1 month after treatment [94, 95]. False-positive PCR results decrease after longer follow-up periods, and approach zero after 12 weeks of therapy [94]. In addition, analytical specificity of PCR testing on stool samples may be reduced due to the presence of non-pylori Helicobacter species present in fecal material [56].

While this study concluded that glmM gene PCR performed best, other studies have reported lower specificities [60, 77]. Assays using 16S rRNA sequences generally report excellent sensitivities, but the specificity of these primers is questionable. Several authors argue that 16S rRNA primers are inappropriate because of sequence conservation among different bacterial genera as well as the possibility for nonspecific amplification of human DNA [76, 77]. Assays targeting vacA have reported moderate sensitivity (89.5 %) but excellent specificity (99.0 %) [84]. The HSP60 gene is thought to be both well conserved and demonstrates species-specific variation [77].

Species designations are determined by immunologic properties as well as DNA homology and oncogenicity [97]. Each species group contains several serotypes classified by neutralization reactions to specific antisera [97]. At present, over 50 serotypes have been described [98]. Serotype groups may be further subdivided into genomic types. Genotypes are assigned lowercase letters to differentiate them from the prototype strain as indicated by the letter \u201cp\u201d [97]. Interspecies DNA sequence variation may be as low as 4 % whereas genotypes within an adenovirus species may be 50 % to nearly 100 % homologous [99, 100]. Intraspecies recombination resulting in intermediate strains has been reported [101].",

Immunofluorescent and immunochromatographic methods, while rapid, are insensitive [107]. EM also is insensitive and is not routinely used in clinical laboratories. Indirect diagnosis using serology is limited by poor sensitivity especially in immunocompromised patients and by high seroprevalence among children preventing the ability to identify acute disease [107, 108].

By contrast, serotyping is important for epidemiology studies, when investigating an especially severe infection, and in predicting clinical outcome [106]. Isolation of specific adenovirus serotypes from the gastrointestinal tract, such as 1, 2, 5, and 6, may raise concern for the possibility of disseminated disease since these serotypes have been documented to cause systemic infections in immunocompromised patients [107]. On the other hand, serotypes 40 and 41, while frequently isolated in cases of gastroenteritis, have not been recovered from immunocompromised patients with disseminated infections [107]. While conventional serotyping methods may take up to several weeks [97], molecular methods such as PCR have improved turnaround times and allow for the characterization of isolates at the species, serotype, and genotype level [107]. Molecular and serological typing results usually are concordant [97].",

Quantitative measurements, however, have allowed investigators to identify rising stool viral loads in the majority of pediatric HSCT patients who go on to develop adenovirus viremia and disseminated disease [105, 113]. Quantitative serial stool measurements, therefore, may serve as a useful tool for predicting when early treatment is warranted and could prevent the overuse of the nephrotoxic antiviral drug cidofovir [113].",

The high degree of genetic heterogeneity among adenovirus serotypes makes detection of all known serotypes by a generic PCR assay difficult [106]. Genetic diversity also complicates identification of regions with sufficient homology to allow for uniform annealing of primers and probes in all serotypes. Currently, most assays use primers and probes that bind to the highly conserved hexon gene, which has only approximately 50 % nucleotide homology between serotypes (NCBI database, [105]). Uniform annealing of primers and probes is even more important for quantitative assays, to ensure equal amplification efficiency of all serotypes [108]. Concern that nucleotide mismatches between target and primer or probe would result in decreased sensitivity of detection for many serotypes has led to more optimal assay designs utilizing multiple primer and probe sets [123]. Lastly, multiplex assays that detect multiple viral pathogens can detect coinfections, although the test performance for adenovirus was occasionally negatively affected by coamplification of other viruses [116].",

The surface of the outermost capsid layer contains two major structural viral proteins, VP4, a protease-cleaved protein (P protein), and VP7, a glycoprotein (G protein). The middle layer of the capsid contains structural protein VP6. The inner capsid layer contains proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA with a complete genome length of 16,500\u201321,000 nucleotides.

Group B rotaviruses were first identified as causing adult diarrhea in a large waterborne epidemic in China. Serologic evidence indicates that Group B rotavirus is also present in the UK and the US, and genome profiles consistent with Group B rotavirus have been detected as causes of diarrhea in India [130]. Group C rotaviruses are an emerging cause of gastroenteritis in both children and adults and have been identified in sporadic cases and outbreaks worldwide. The Group A rotaviruses are further classified into serotypes based on neutralizing serologic reactions against the P (VP4) and G (VP7) proteins. Also, because the two gene segments that encode the P and G proteins segregate independently, a genotyping system has been developed based on the sequences of both genes. The most prevalent Group A rotavirus genotypes in humans are G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], and G9P[8]. A Rotavirus Classification Working Group has been formed to assist in classification of any newly described rotavirus genotypes based on sequence information for all 11 genomic RNA segments.",

Evidence also suggests that caliciviruses may be transmitted by close exposure to aerosols generated during vomiting episodes in infected individuals. The most frequent cause of norovirus infection appears to be consumption of food or beverages that are contaminated either at their source or by infected food handlers. Uncooked shellfish, particularly oysters, as well as raspberries and precooked foods, such as salad, ham, and sandwiches, are among the common foods that have been responsible for outbreaks [161]. Outbreaks resulting from contamination of municipal water are rare, but water-borne outbreaks associated with community or family water systems have been documented. Sapoviruses have been associated with food-borne outbreaks, but much less frequently than noroviruses. Sapovirus infections are not associated with eating seafood. Nosocomial infections due to caliciviruses are increasingly recognized and may be quite common.",

The highly variable nature of calicivirus genomes presents a significant challenge to designing molecular assays for diagnostic use. The literature contains details of a variety of RT-PCR assays that have been used for the detection of human caliciviruses in diagnostic studies as well epidemiologic investigations of food, water, and other environmental samples. Some of the assays are designed to detect sapoviruses without cross-reactivity with noroviruses or rotaviruses. Among them is a quantitative real-time PCR assay using primers against the junction of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase/capsid genes that has been described to detect sapovirus genogroups I, II, and IV with an analytical sensitivity of ten copies of viral cDNA per reaction [165]. Conventional qualitative RT-PCR assays that detect all genogroups of human sapoviruses have also been developed [166]. Nested RT-PCR assays that claim to be more sensitive than conventional PCR that detect and differentiate all genogroups of human sapovirus have been reported using primers against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region [167] or the capsid-protein coding region [168]. Molecular assays using various protocols and primer sets to detect noroviruses have been similarly described. Only a small region of approximately 50 base pairs at the polymerase (ORF-1)/capsid (ORF2) junction of the norovirus genome appears to be sufficiently conserved to detect all within-genogroup variants [169\u2013171]. Additional assays have been published that use multiple primers in a multiplex format to amplify the capsid region of the respective viral targets to simultaneously detect norovirus genogroups I and II, sapoviruses, and astroviruses [172].",

Whereas microscopic examination requires the presence of whole intact parasite for visualization, PCR can only detect the presence of the parasite DNA and cannot distinguish between live, damaged, or dead organisms. Also, the length of time that parasite DNA can be detected after clearance of the organism from the body has not been studied for gastrointestinal parasites, and the possibility that positive results obtained by PCR analysis might be due to lingering parasite DNA may need to be considered, depending on the clinical situation. In addition, asymptomatic carriage is common and must be considered when drawing conclusions about positive results if molecular tests are being used for screening purposes, such as for travelers returning from endemic regions or foreign adopted children.",

Preservatives can interfere with PCR-based tests since they act by producing cross-links between nucleic acids and proteins which can obstruct DNA extraction and block PCR amplification. Preservatives also have the potential to cause fragmentation of nucleic acids which could interfere with target amplification. Specimens for molecular tests must be collected without preservatives and kept refrigerated or frozen prior to testing.",

Molecular tests are more sensitive but are not developed to the point where microscopy will be completely replaced by PCR. The introduction of real-time PCR assays, especially those that combine several targets into multiplex assays, offers the possibility of using DNA-based detection techniques as a component of a diagnostic approach. However, one of the constraints of multiplex assays is the restriction in the number of parasitic targets that can be detected simultaneously. Additional pathogenic parasites that are not targeted in the molecular assays will still need to be tested for by traditional microscopy or antigen detection methods.",
