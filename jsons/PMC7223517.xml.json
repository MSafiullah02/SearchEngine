Even with strong recommendations for invasive ICP monitoring in adults, adoption among pediatric trauma centers is highly variable and reported anywhere from 7 to 70% [2, 3, 7-16]. Despite a logical connection between ICP monitoring and improved outcomes, there is yet to be definitive evidence (adult or pediatric) which demonstrates improved survival with invasive monitoring techniques. The most recent wording of the adult BTF guidelines suggests only \"management of severe TBI patients using information from ICP monitoring,\u201d and specific indications for the placement of ICP monitors are absent from the most recent adult and pediatric BTF guidelines [17, 18].",

We sought to provide a contemporary analysis of severe TBI in children and potentially identify a subset of patients that may benefit from invasive ICP monitoring. A study examining the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) using data from 2001\u20132006 demonstrated that while there was no overall difference in mortality for children with ICP monitors, patients with an initial GCS of 3 actually had a survival benefit with their placement [8]. However, this study evaluated the use of all the various ICP monitors, including intraparenchymal pressure monitors and ventricular drain monitors, and did not differentiate if there was a difference in mortality among the various ICP monitoring devices. We sought to determine the association between ICP monitors and invasive cerebral oxygen tension monitors and mortality in pediatric TBI patients, stratifying by device and GCS. We hypothesized that in more severely injured patients (GCS 3\u20134), there would be a decreased mortality associated with invasive monitoring devices.",

Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables and Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables for bivariate analysis. Odds of mortality was determined using a stepwise, hierarchical multivariable logistic regression model. All variables were eligible for inclusion in the multivariable model. These were first measured using a univariate logistic regression model and variables with a p < 0.2 were included in a multivariable logistic regression model. We then performed a stepwise, hierarchical regression to select the model with the best fit for the outcome of interest\u2014mortality. Since we included a binary outcome of mortality, we chose to use the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test to evaluate our model. This test produces a Chi-square Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow statistic and a p value, which, if greater than 0.05, suggests good fit. We did find that our models based on the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test had good fit with a Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow Chi-square statistic which was 2.94, with a p value = 0.44. Additionally, the Nagelkerke R square was 0.59 for the model. A secondary multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine odds of mortality as stratified by type of invasive monitoring device (intraparenchymal pressure monitors vs. intraventricular monitors vs. oxygen tension monitors). This was then repeated with an additional stratification by a tripartite subdivision of GCS (3\u20134 vs. 5\u20136 vs. 7\u20138). The reference group for these analyses included patients with no invasive monitoring device. The risk of mortality was reported with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).",

Invasive monitoring patients also had a higher incidence of both in-hospital mortality and in-hospital complications (AKI, ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT, pneumonia, UTI, severe sepsis). The use of an ICP monitor was an independent risk factor for mortality. Specifically, intraparenchymal pressure monitors and intraventricular drains/monitors were independently associated with an increased risk of mortality, while intraparenchymal oxygen monitors showed no difference. Contrary to our hypothesis, despite adjusting for invasive monitor type and presenting GCS, there did not appear to be any specific group that saw a mortality benefit and the risk of mortality was increased for several groups.",

This wide variation could be secondary to highly varied utilization between individual institutions. Bennett et al., for instance, had very similar inclusion criteria to our study and showed an overall utilization rate of around 32.5% using a linked Pediatric Health Information (PHIS)-National Trauma Databank (NTDB) database, though individual institution utilization rates varied anywhere between 5 and 50% within their study [2]. Similarly, Van Cleve et al. had an overall utilization rate of 27% but found that adult trauma centers were more likely to place invasive monitoring devices into pediatric patients than combined pediatric/adult trauma centers [7]. Roumeliotis et al. actually speculated that the low rates of ICP monitor usage might be due to more rapid improvement or deterioration of clinical status than adult patients [10].",

The mortality risk associated with invasive ICP monitoring has not been demonstrated in other pediatric studies that evaluated for this association [2, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16]. The published unadjusted mortality rates for pediatric patients with severe TBI who undergo ICP monitoring are frequently higher, but many studies showed no difference in mortality after adjusting for other covariables [2, 15, 16]. Bennett et al. had very similar raw mortality rates to our study (ICP [18.5%] vs. no ICP [9.5%]), but after using propensity scoring to adjust for a variety of variables, there was no significant difference in likelihood of mortality [2]. Some of this difference might be explained by the inclusion of hospital clustering in their model, which we were unable to do. It is also possible that the limited number of centers included in their study (31 pediatric hospitals) is less generalizable to lower volume pediatric centers, and the ICP monitors have worse outcomes outside of those high-volume centers.",

After adjustment for other variables, ICP monitoring was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.64) but only for those children with a GCS of 3 [8]. This led us to hypothesize that there may be a subset of patients in the TQIP database who similarly benefited from ICP monitoring. However, our findings did not support our hypothesis. Unfortunately, stratifying patients by GCS had the opposite effect. While both intraventricular and intraparenchymal pressure monitors were associated with a modest increase in mortality (OR 1.89 and 1.86, respectively), this was specifically seen in the subgroup of patients with a GCS of 5\u20136. For patients with a GCS of 5\u20136, there was nearly a fivefold increased risk of mortality with any invasive type of monitor device; this risk was highest in children with intraventricular drain (OR 6.77). This could potentially be explained by how the ICP monitor is interpreted and utilized by providers. If patients with a lower GCS have poor outcomes regardless of intervention and patients with a GCS of 7\u20138 are more likely to improve, the use of an ICP monitor would be less likely to change the outcome compared with a more middling severe TBI group. However, without knowing the interventions that were undertaken in response to intracranial hypertension, this remains speculative.",

In 2013, a study looking at high-dose barbiturates for refractory intracranial hypertension in pediatric patients showed better long-term outcomes when ICPs were controlled compared to uncontrolled ICPs [32], but this finding does not seem to translate to monitoring having a benefit. Balakrishnan et al. hypothesized that it was related to timing, but their single institution study failed to show any difference in mortality, LOS or functional outcomes between early (< 6 h) and late placement (6\u201372 h) of ICP monitors in pediatric patients [16]. It is possible that it is our interpretation of ICPs and cerebral perfusion pressures that limit the utility of monitors, as some exploratory studies have shown algorithmic and continuous approaches to ICP monitors may have prognostic value above intermittent measurements [33-35]. Newer technologies (e.g., cerebral oxygen tension) have also shown some promise over more traditional methods of invasive ICP monitoring [7]. While intraparenchymal oxygen monitors did not have a statistically significant association with mortality in this study, they only made up 4.5% of the patient population. It is possible that more patients may prove this modality to be beneficial.",

Though we attempted to adjust for selection bias, it is still present as with all retrospective studies. In addition, the TQIP database only includes those children that are admitted and does not account for non-TQIP centers. Especially in light of other studies showing the significant variability between individual pediatric centers, TQIP centers may not be representative of all pediatric hospitals. The database also lacks pertinent information (e.g., socioeconomic status, presence of coagulopathy), which may be prognostic in TBI outcomes. In addition, missing pertinent variables that are not included in TQIP include center volume, institutional protocols for the placement of ICP monitor and management of intracranial hypertension, actual ICP/CPP measurements, timing of invasive monitor placement, and other potentially prognostic variables (e.g., pupillary response). Without knowing what interventions were taken for intracranial hypertension, it is difficult to determine whether this association with mortality is related to the device or how providers utilize the information gained from them. There is also some degree of overlap between monitor types, particularly for intraparenchymal oxygen monitors, which may skew the effect that an individual monitor has on mortality. Furthermore, we cannot track long-term neurologic outcomes for those patients that survive, which is a significant limitation of this database, because TQIP only provides index hospitalization data. While we adjusted for injury severity using GCS-Motor scores and AIS-Head scores, lack of specific imaging data is a significant limitation of the TQIP database, and it is possible that patients in one group had more severe injuries by imaging criteria.",

While newer technologies, such as cerebral oxygen tension or continuous cerebral perfusion pressures, may prove to be beneficial over time, there is insufficient evidence to support widespread use in pediatric patients with severe TBI based on our findings. A prospective, randomized trial is desperately needed to determine which patients, if any, are likely to benefit from these monitoring devices.",
