In a 2007 report, the Centers for Disease Control concluded that Staphylococcus aureus is now the most important cause of serious and fatal infection in the United States [3]. The prototypical USA400 strain, MW2, (CDC nomenclature for this strain of MRSA) was first isolated in 1999 from a Midwest child with fatal CA-MRSA pneumonia [4]. In 2003, the prototypical USA300 CA-MRSA strain, LAC, was isolated from Los Angeles County patients with skin and soft tissue infections, severe pneumonia and sepsis. Recently, concerns about CA-MRSA infections were heightened after reports of severe invasive staphylococcal infections in some patients infected with the novel 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus [5,6].",

            "text": "Monocytes and macrophages play important roles in host defense against staphylococci and other pyogenic bacteria [10], but excessive systemic or local production of inflammatory mediators by macrophages could be deleterious in patients with severe staphylococcal infections. We previously reported that RAW264.7 murine macrophages exposed to any of a series of six pediatric clinical isolates of S. aureus (two CA-MRSA, two HA-MRSA, and two methicillin-susceptible strains) in the presence of daptomycin (vs. vancomycin) secreted less TNF and accumulated less inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein [11]. Vancomycin is a cell-wall active antibiotic that triggers bacterial lysis; it is the antibiotic most commonly used to treat severe MRSA infections in children [12]. Daptomycin is a novel antibiotic that is rapidly bactericidal against staphylococci but does not appear to cause rapid bacterial lysis; the mechanism of its action is not certain but it is reported to trigger depolarization of the bacterial membranes and inhibition of both DNA and RNA synthesis [13,14]. The rapid lysis of staphylococci, streptococci and other pyogenic bacteria exposed to cell-wall active antibiotics such as beta-lactams and vancomycin results in exaggerated release of bacterial products and an augmented and potentially harmful host inflammatory response [15,16]. Therefore, optimal treatment of sepsis and other severe bacterial infections might include the use of antibiotics and/or other medications that blunt the host inflammatory response and dampen the cytokine cascade [16].",

The reasoning for ketamine's use in staphylococcal septic shock is its blood pressure supporting effect. It increases cardiac output and blood pressure, possibly via a catecholamine release mechanism [17,21]. Some data suggest that ketamine has anti-inflammatory effects [22-25]. For example, it has been reported that ketamine suppresses macrophage TNF secretion in response to Gram-negative bacterial LPS in vivo and in vitro [22,23,25]. There is also one report that ketamine suppresses TNF production by human whole blood in vitro after exposure to staphylococcal enterotoxin B [24]. The mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine are not known [22-25].The present study examined the hypothesis that ketamine could suppress macrophage TNF production in response to whole bacteria, in this case clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Given the important role of TNF in sepsis [26-29], and the importance of staphylococcal sepsis in children, such suppression could have a therapeutic impact.",

Because S. aureus is able to \"attack\" or form pores in macrophages, TNF secretion occurs even in the absence of TLR 2 and TLR4 sensors (possibly via Nod1 and Nod2, intracytoplasmic sensors of peptidoglycan-derived muropeptides) [31]. Therefore, another mechanism independent of Toll-like receptors must exist for ketamine's anti-inflammatory action, at least in staphylococcal infections.",

Prompt antibiotic treatment of these and other serious bacterial infections is indicated, but paradoxically has the potential to trigger excessive release of bacterial products and the subsequent augmentation of the host inflammatory response [15,16]. Macrophages are important sources of many of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF) secreted in response to staphylococci and other Gram-positive bacteria [15,16,41]. Although the cytokine cascade is essential for normal host defense, excessive or inappropriate inflammation can be harmful. Therefore we need an improved understanding of these interactions in order to develop better adjunctive therapies for patients with severe bacterial infections.",

To translate the present findings, we are currently working on a clinical model to assess the clinical significance of ketamine's anti-inflammatory effects in patients with bacterial sepsis. Although studies of the effect of ketamine on macrophage responses to purified bacterial components such as Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Gram-positive lipoteichoic acid (LTA) are instructive [23,24,49], we argue that characterization of the macrophage responses to whole organisms is more likely to provide clinical insights. Indeed, the pioneering experiments of Carswell and Old that identified TNF used whole bacteria as stimuli in macrophage sepsis simulation settings [49], and we have previously demonstrated that macrophage responses to live, antibiotic-treated staphylococci serve as a powerful model system. Furthermore, the model examines the effect of ketamine only in the presence of antibiotics (either vancomycin or daptomycin). In practice, this is a common clinical scenario. Our data suggest that clinically achievable concentrations of both ketamine and daptomycin could potentially inhibit the excessive macrophage inflammatory response that is observed in patients with severe staphylococcal infections.",
