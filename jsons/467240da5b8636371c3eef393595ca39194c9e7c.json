In general, the lungs have around 300 million alveoli; each individual alveolus is wrapped in a bundle of capillaries where the primary site of gaseous exchange with the blood takes place (Weibel and Gomez, 1962) . The alveoli consist of an epithelial layer and extracellular matrix surrounded by capillaries. There are three main alveolar cell types in the alveolar wall, namely type I cells, type II cells, and macrophages. Type I cells are the cells that are made of the alveolar wall; whereas type II cells are secretory cells that secrete surfactants and form the aqueous protein-containing layer which facilitate gaseous exchange as well as preventing collapse of the alveoli (Penney, 1988) .

Overall, each method has its own merit to the understanding of the etiology of the disease or the action mechanism of an agent to the lung cells. Usually, biomarker study by sampling of body fluids is a convenient way to obtain the starting material, compared with using biopsies or autopsies. The generation of gene-knockout mice (e.g., cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane receptor knockout mice) as a studying model of CF also tremendously facilitated the discovery of the biomarkers and the understanding of this severely genetic disease (Bensalem et al., 2005; Brouillard et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 242, "text": "(Wattiez and Falmagne, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 306, "end": 325, "text": "(Kips et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1073, "text": "(Bensalem et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1098, "text": "Brouillard et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 499, "end": 507, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Studying Models for Lung-Related Diseases"}, {"text": "In order to facilitate the process of biomarker discovery, many enrichment methods and strategies have been developed.

This method reduces the complexity and also indirectly provides for an enrichment of the proteins being studied and as a corollary of this, it can facilitate the resolution of protein separation and enhance the sensitivity of protein detection by mass spectrometry. Subcellular proteomics is particularly useful to delineate the functional significance of the subcellular localization of a protein where conventional proteomics using whole cell extract can never achieve this result. Further, the use of laser capture dissection on tissues can efficiently obtain more homogeneous cell type for research instead of contamination of mixtures of cancer and normal cells (Gutstein and Morris, 2007) .

In another study of saline-induced sputum from adults with CF with an exacerbation, extensive proteolytic IgG degradation and influx of inflammation-related proteins were observed, indicating these changes as predictors of CF lung exacerbation . Also, while the main high-molecular mass proteins in the sputum from all subjects were the mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC, these appeared degraded in CF adults with an JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY exacerbation. The glycosylation of these mucins also showed reduced sulfation, increased sialylation, and reduced fucosylation in CF adults compared with controls (Schulz et al., 2007) . Besides using sputum, serum samples from CF patients have been pooled and compared with equivalent pools of control sera in order to identify patterns of protein expression unique to CF by antibody microarrays. The set of significantly differentially expressed protein was enriched in protein mediators or inflammation from the NFkB signaling pathway . Also, in pediatric CF patients, SELDI-TOF-MS BALF profiling identified 53 unique, reliable proteins. They included the neutrophil proteins, a-defensin 1 and 2, calcium-binding proteins S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12, as well as novel forms of S100A8 and S100A12 with equivalent C-terminal deletions. Concentrations of these molecules are abnormally high in early CF patients. The data provide new insights into CF lung disease and identify novel proteins strongly associated with CF airway inflammation (McMorran et al., 2007) . Using CF bronchial biopsies in normal and CF patients, the chaperone 75 kDa glucose-regulated protein and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex core protein I and one form of nidogen, a pseudogene of aconitase 2, were increased in CF.

Among the high abundance proteins identified were sets of proteins associated with inflammation, including the classical NFkB, p65 (RelA) and NFkB, p65 (RelB) (Pollard et al., 2005) . Following this study, by comparing the IB3-1 cells with IB3-1/S9 daughter cells repaired by gene transfer with AAV-(wild-type) CFTR, by simultaneous measurement of de novo biosynthetic rate with [ 35 S]methionine of all 194 proteins in both cell types resulted in the identification of an additional 31 CF-specific proteins. This kinetic portion of the high abundance CF proteome, hidden from direct analysis of abundance, included proteins from transcription and signaling pathways such as NFkB, chaperones such as HSC70, cytoskeletal proteins, and others. The conclusion of this study was that measurement of biosynthetic rates on a global scale could be used to identify disease-specific differences within the high abundance CF proteome . Finally, using cftr \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, annexin A1 was found to be absent in their colonic crypts. Concurrently, annexin A1 was also undetectable in lungs and pancreas of these mice. It was suggested that the absence of this inhibitory mediator of the host inflammatory response was associated with colonic up-regulation of the proinflammatory cytosolic phospholipase A2. More importantly, annexin A1 was also down-regulated in nasal epithelial cells from CF patients, suggesting that decreased expression of annexin A1 contributed to the worsening of the CF phenotype (Bensalem et al., 2005) . Following this study, the same group also demonstrated that, mCICA3, a member of a family of calcium-activated chloride channels considered to be key molecules in mucus secretion by globlet cells, was significantly decreased in the colon and lung of the cftr \u00c0/\u00c0 mice.

It has been shown that OVA-induced oxidative stress resulted in proteolysis of annexin-1 and consequent up-regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity and leukotriene production in the lungs of these mice (Chung et al., 2004) . Nitrotyrosine is a marker of cellular oxidative stress; over 30 different proteins were targets of nitration following OVA challenge, including the antioxidative enzyme catalase. Oxidative modification at Cys 377 of catalase and loss of the enzyme activity was observed. Subsequent analysis of human BALF showed that catalase activity was reduced in asthma by up to 50% as compared with normal controls. This study provided insights that catalase inactivation might be the one of the culprits contributing to the chronic inflammatory state of the asthmatic airway (Ghosh et al., 2006) . While other studies showed that lungkine, a recently described chemokine, a family of chitinases including Ym1, Ym2, FIZZ1, and acidic mammalian chitinase, gob-5, a protein that mediates mucus secretion, and surfactant protein-D, a C-type lectin capable of modulating inflammatory responses, were significantly increased in the BALFs of OVA-treated asthmatic mice (Zhao et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009 ). Finally, using plasma peptides from control and chronic asthma mice induced by OVA, the authors quantitatively identified the fragment f of complement 3 (C3f), which is important for inflammation, was significantly higher in controls than chronic asthma mice. This study suggested that native small peptides detected by non-2DE techniques may be useful and specific biomarkers of disease (Yeo et al., 2004) . In human subjects, clinical study of patients by using peripheral T-lymphocytes from six normal individuals and six patients with asthma, increased expression of phosphodiesterase 4C and thioredoxin-2 and decreased expression of glutathione S-transferase M3 were confirmed in asthmatic patients, which may indicate as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets (Jeong et al., 2007) . Finally, it has been shown that gelsolin level was elevated in the BALF of patients with asthma.

These results exhibited that the IGF pathway regulated apoptosis of lung fibroblasts but not lung epithelial cells, and IGF pathway may contribute to the fibroproliferative response in ARDS (Schnapp et al., 2006) . In another study, using SELDI-TOF and electrophoresis-based proteomics, it was found that increased levels of apolipoprotein A1, S100A8, and S100A9 proteins, in the BALF of subjects challenged with bronchial lung endotoxin and patients with ARDS (de Torre et al., 2006) .

These data revealed that SP-A was linked to the pathogenesis of COPD and could be considered as a potential COPD biomarker (Ohlmeier et al., 2008) . In a recent study, serum amyloid A (SAA) was identified as a novel blood biomarker of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) that was more sensitive than C-reactive protein alone or in combination with dyspnea.

These included antioxidant enzymes (heme oxygenase-1 and catalase), proinflammatory components (p38 MAPK and Rel A), and products of intermediary metabolism that were regulated by oxidative stress (Xiao et al., 2003) . Later, the same group of researchers showed that treatment of BEAS-2B cells with organic DEP chemicals caused the induction of at least 14 proteins, among which heat shock protein (HSP70), HSP40, TPR2, and T-complex protein 1 (zeta-subunit) were known to play a role in the UPR. DEP extracts also induced the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in the culture supernatant. These responses could be abrogated in the presence of NAC . These data exhibited that DEP induced oxidative stress response, UPR, and proinflammatory effects and that some of these proteins may serve as markers for PM exposures. Other airborne PM, with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mm (PM10), is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds containing sulfates and various metals such as titanium (Pagan et al., 2003) . Because acute and chronic exposures to TiO 2 particles have been shown to induce inflammatory responses in the airways and alveolar spaces of rats (Schapira et al., 1995; Warheit et al., 1997; Ahn et al., 2005; Kang et al., 2005) , TiO 2 -treated rats are tested as a good model for the study of the human epithelial response to PM10 particles. Treatment of epithelial cells with BSA-coated TiO 2 particles altered expression of 20 proteins. These included defense-related, cell activating, and cytoskeletal proteins implicated in the response to oxidative stress. Among one of these proteins was macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF was expressed primarily in epithelium and was elevated in lung tissues and BALFs of TiO 2 -treated rats. Interestingly, carbon black and DEP also induced expression of MIF protein in the epithelial cells (Cha et al., 2007) . Last but not the least, ultrafine carbon black (ufCB), which is carbon-centered ultrafine particles ( 0.1 mm in diameter), comprises the majority of fine particulate matters (Oberd\u00f6 rster and Utell, 2002) . Significantly greater increases in neutrophils influx and total proteins in BALF have been observed after intratracheal instillation of ufCB, compared with carbon black (250 nm in diameter) (Li et al., 1996) . UfCB also acts through a ROS-dependent pathway to cause vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and lung injury in mice (Chang et al., 2005) . Further proteomic study was carried out with BALF from mice after treatment with ufCB. Results showed that ufCB exposure caused the increase of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) in BALF and decrease of both receptors in lung tissues, suggesting the acceleration of epithelial shedding from the lungs and increase of cell debris with membrane proteins EGFR and LIFR in BALF.

In He's group, they identified and characterized the structural proteins of SARS-CoV isolated from Vero E6 cells infected with the BJ-01 strain of the virus (Ying et al., 2004) . In another study, the cytosol and nucleus fractions of SARS-CoV-infected cells as well as the crude virions were analyzed by one-dimensional electrophoresis followed by ESI-MS/MS identification or by shotgun strategy with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-ESI-MS/MS. Of all the four predicted structural proteins of SARS-CoV, including S (spike), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and E (envelope) proteins, were identified. This study indicated that 2D-LC-MS/ MS made contribution to rapidly and accurately characterize whether the cells contained virus and may be used for rapid screening the virus, virus-infected cells or even body fluids (Zeng et al., 2004a) . Further, characterization of the 3a protein of SARS-CoV in infected Vero E6 cells and sera from SARS patients showed that there was a tendency existed for co-mutation between the 3a protein and the spike protein of SARS-CoV isolates. The conclusion was that the 3a protein might be tightly correlated to the spike protein in the SARS-CoV functions and it may serve as a new clinical marker or drug target for SARS treatment (Zeng et al., 2004b) . To analyze the differential cellular response to SARS-CoV, the proteome of Vero E6 cells with and without infection of SARS-CoV were resolved and quantitated with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by ESI-MS/MS identification. Also, ICAT technology coupled with two-dimensional LC-MS/MS were applied to the differential proteins of infected cells. By combining these two methods, 355 unique proteins were identified and quantitated with 186 of them differentially expressed.

The dramatic increase in TF-a 1 -AT may be the results of degradation of a 1 -AT. As a 1 -AT plays an important role in the protection of lung function, its degradation may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of SARS and also may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of SARS (Ren et al., 2004) . Using SELDI-TOF-MS analysis on 89 sera collected from 28 SARS patients and 72 sera from 51 control patients with various viral or bacterial infections, and 10 sera from apparently healthy individuals, 9 significantly increased and 3 significantly decreased serum biomarkers were discovered in the SARS patients compared with the controls. Among these up-regulated markers, SAA protein was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis and there was a good correlation between SAA concentration and the extent of pneumonia. SAA could be used to monitor disease activity and response to treatment in SARS patients (Yip et al., 2005) . In another study, using serum of 39 patients with early-stage SARS infection and 39 suspected SARS patients during the SARS outbreak period, the authors reported that 2 proteomic features having the highest diagnostic value were the N-terminal fragment of complement C3c a-chain and an internal fragment of fibrinogen a-E chain (Pang et al., 2006) .

There were several proteins that have never been identified in plasma before using 2D gel electrophoresis, among which was peroxiredoxin II (Prx II). The high level of plasma Prx II in patients with SARS could be secreted by T cells, which indicated that active innate immune responses, along with the oxidation-associated injuries, may play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS . In another recent study, plasma proteins of SARS patients with those of a normal control group were compared.

Results indicated that 11 mycobacterial proteins were exclusively detected in intraphagosomal mycobacteria, when compared with those of broth-cultured mycobacteria. Six of the identified proteins were only observed in phagosomal mycobacteria, namely phosphoglycerate mutase I (Gpm; Rv0489), a lipid carrier protein (Rv1627c), a putative potassium uptake protein (TrkA; Rv2691), and the conserved hypothetical proteins Rv0428c, Rv1130, and Rv1191 have not been identified previously in broth-cultured mycobacteria, suggesting that these proteins were indeed unique to phagosomal M. tuberculosis. The identification of the roles of these proteins and targeted drug design would allow direct interference of their functions to control intracellular growth of mycobacteria (Mattow et al., 2006) . In another study, proteins secreted in the culture medium from the M. tuberculosis K-strain, which is the most prevalent among the clinical isolates in Korea and belongs to the Beijing family, were analyzed by 2D PAGE and compared with those from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv and CDC1551 strains. Eleven proteins, Rv0652, Rv1636, Rv2818c, Rv3369, Rv3865, Rv0566c, MT3304, Rv3160, Rv3874, Rv0560c, and Rv3648c, were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS or LC-ESI-MS. All these proteins were cloned and expressed in E. coli and affinity purified. By using three of these recombinant proteins in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), when 100 sera from TB patients and 100 sera from the healthy controls were analyzed, rRv3369, rRv3874, and rRv0566c showed a sensitivity of 60%, 74%, and 43%, and a specificity of 96%, 97%, and 84%, respectively.

A 32-kDa putative glyoxalase in the culture filtrate of growing M. tuberculosis (originally annotated as Rv0577, which is now designed as CFP32) was identified, cloned, and characterized.

Interestingly, per sample, sputum CFP32 levels (a potential indicator of increasing bacterial burden) correlated with levels of expression in sputum of interleukin-10 (an immunosuppressive cytokine and a putative contributing factor to disease progression) but not levels of gamma interferon (a key cytokine in the protective immune response in TB), as measured by ELISA.

Following this study, the same group reported the use of multiepitope polyproteins in serodiagnosis of active TB. This time, three more TB antigens, Mtb11 (also known as CFP-10), Mtb8, and Mtb48, were tested together with the previously reported 38-kDa protein as well as their previously identified antigen Mtb81. Improved reactivity was observed, which indicated that the use of multiple antigens with some of which in a single polyprotein, can be used to facilitate the development of a highly sensitive test for M. tuberculosis antibody detection (Houghton et al., 2002) . Finally, in a recent study, serum proteomic profiles were obtained from patients with active TB and controls by SELDI-TOF-MS. A supervised machine-learning approach based on the support vector machine (SVM) was used to obtain a classifier that distinguished between the groups in two independent test sets. A classifier trained on the 20 most informative peaks achieved diagnostic accuracy of 90%. From these, two peptides (SAA protein and transthyretin) were identified and quantitated by immunoassay. Since these peptides reflected inflammatory states, the authors also quantitated neopterin and C-reactive protein. Application of an SVM classifier using combinations of these values gave diagnostic accuracies of up to 84% for TB.

Using the same batch of samples, Beer's group also demonstrated that 14 of 21 isoforms of cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CK8, CK18, and CK19 occurred at significantly higher levels in tumors compared with those of uninvolved adjacent tissue . Similarly, our recent study also demonstrated that increased expressions of CK8 and CK14 in cadmium-induced lung cell transformation (Lau and Chiu, 2007) . It is suggested that increased expressions of specific cytokeratins can act as a scaffold to bind to apoptotic factors, preventing them to do their functions, which can provide additional survival advantages to evade apoptosis. Therefore, specific isoforms of individual CK may have utility as diagnostic or predictive markers in lung tumorigenesis. Using laser capture microdissection, differential proteins between primary lung adenocarcinoma with (LNM AdC) and without lymph node metastasis (non-LNM AdC) were identified by 2D-DIGE-MS. It was found that annexin A3, was significantly up-regulated in LNM AdC compared with non-LNM AdC. Immunohistochemistry also showed that annexin A3 overexpression was frequently observed in LNM AdCs and matched lymph node metastases compared with that of non-LNM AdCs. These data indicated that annexin A3 might serve as a novel biomarker for lymph node metastasis and prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (Liu et al., 2009) . Comparative proteome analysis on 20 human lung squamous carcinoma (hLSC) tissues and paired normal bronchial epithelial tissues revealed 76 differential proteins, among which 68 proteins were identified by PMF. Serological proteome analysis of 10 hLSC tissues was performed to identify the tumor-associated antigens. The results revealed 36 AE 8 differential proteins reactive with patients' autologous sera, of which 14 proteins were identified. Six of the 14 proteins, alpha enolase, pre-B cell-enhancing factor precursor, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase 1, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, and guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta subunit-like protein, were up-regulated in hLSCs, indicating potential application of these 6 hLSC-associated antigens in diagnosis and therapy of hLSC . In another study, the authors investigated the distribution and expression of various Prx isoforms in lung cancer and compared this with normal lung from human and mouse. Among the Prx isoforms, immunohistochemical staining showed the isoforms Prx I, II, III, and V were predominantly expressed in bronchial and alveolar epithelium as well as in alveolar macrophages of the normal mouse lung. The isoforms I and III were over-expressed in lung cancer tissues compared with normal lungs.

An augmented expression of Prx I was confirmed in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues from lung cancer patients, suggesting that it could be a potential biomarker of lung cancer (Chang et al., 2001) . M-BE, a SV40T-transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line with the phenotypic features of early tumorigenesis at high passage, was cultured in the conditioned media to collect its secretory proteins. Cathepsin D was found to be increased either in culture media or in cells during passaging. Tissue microarray and sandwich ELISA analyses also validated significantly higher levels of cathepsin D in SCC tissues as well as in plasma of lung squamous cell carcinoma patients, respectively, as compared with normal donors, indicating a potential role as a biomarker for lung cancer (Lou et al., 2007) . Similarly, using NSCLC cell line A549, 14 proteins were found to be secreted in the conditioned medium, including peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, manganese superoxide dismutase, Prx I, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, glutathione S-transferase P, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (PGP9.5), alpha enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase 1, galectin-1, and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DDH).

Concurrently, serum level of DDH was significantly higher in NSCLC patients than nonmalignant lung tumor and healthy controls. These data suggested that DDH could be served as a tissue marker and a novel serological marker of NSCLC . Further, protein profiles of four different human NSCLC cell lines were compared with normal human bronchial epithelial cells using 2-DE and MALDI-TOF-MS.
