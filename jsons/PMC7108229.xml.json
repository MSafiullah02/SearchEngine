            "text": "For diagnosis of influenza virus infections a variety of techniques is being used, of which the application depends on the clinical setting and purpose.1 Time consuming virus isolation is required to determine the antigenic match with the influenza vaccine whilst point-of-care (POC) antigenic tests are used for rapid determination of infection to be able to timely implement therapy for the patient or preventive measures to limit spread in outbreak situations.1, 2, 3, 4 A major drawback, however, of POC antigenic tests is their relative insensitivity and hence unsuitability for individual patient diagnosis without additional (confirmatory) tests.2, 3 Therefore, a need for more sensitive POC tests arose, in particular for diagnosing infections with the highly fatal A(H5N1) influenza virus.5 Although real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is rapid it needs expensive equipment, a well suited laboratory and trained personnel for RNA purification and RT-PCR reagent preparation and still takes about 4 hours.1, 3 The main bottle-neck in developing POC qRT-PCR has been sample preparation.6 Several prototype POC qRT-PCR systems for diagnosing influenza and other respiratory virus infections have been developed, e.g. the Liat Tube real-time (RT-)PCR from IQuum Inc. (http://www.iquum.com), the Enigma ML real-time PCR from Enigma Diagnsotics Ltd. (http://www.enigmadiagnostics.com), the FilmArray Respiratory Panel from Idaho Technology Inc. (http://www.idahotech.com/FilmArray) and the Xpert Flu A Panel from Cepheid (http://www.cepheid.com/tests-and-reagents/xpert-flu-a-panel). They all combine sample preparation with single or multiplex qRT-PCR in a closed system and an assay can be completed within an hour. A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic virus was included in these assays as POC qRT-PCR systems could be particular useful for on-site triage and for rapid and easy diagnosis during off-office hours. The first commercial available POC qRT-PCR test for detecting influenza A and subtyping A(H1N1) 2009 virus on the market was the Xpert Flu A Panel which is evaluated in this study.",

All specimens that were parallel tested with the Xpert Flu A panel and the qRT-PCR had the same freeze/thaw cycle. As Universal Transport Medium (UTM) (Copan Italia S.p.A, Italy) is the preferred specimen transport medium for the Xpert Flu A Panel and we use GLY transport medium, we compared performance of both transport media by diluting clinical specimens in UTM and GLY and analysing the diluted specimens by both assays.",

The Xpert Flu A Panel does detect human influenza A viruses including the A(H1N1) 2009 variant with an analytical sensitivity similar to our qRT-PCR, however, some low viral load specimens were not detected. In addition, viral load limitation was particularly noticed for avian influenza viruses A(H5N1) and A(H5N2), whilst A(H9N2) was not detected at all. This is an important limitation as there is an urgent need for molecular POC tests detecting avian influenza viruses.5\n",

However, all specimens with repeatable inconsistent A(H1N1) 2009 results in the qRT-PCR were not detected in the Xpert Flu A Panel. Sequencing of the primer and probe targets of the qRT-PCR of these viruses revealed that there were some mismatches explaining the inconsistent results (not shown). As the primer and probe binding targets included in the Xpert Flu A Panel were not revealed by Cepheid it was impossible to determine whether lack of performance with some specimens was caused by mismatching of primers and/or probes. Drift of influenza viruses necessitates regular updating of primers and probes and especially quick updating is needed when a virus with mutated primer or probe binding site becomes the dominant virus in a season. Emergency use authorisation of commercial influenza molecular tests might overcome this problem, however, even emergency development and validation might take longer than a season lasts. Therefore, molecular POC can never fully replace in-house qRT-PCR for detection and identification of influenza viruses.",

However, the Xpert Flu A Panel is a welcome alternative to antigenic rapid tests in large practices and to qRT-PCR in laboratories for emergency diagnostics during off-office hours.
