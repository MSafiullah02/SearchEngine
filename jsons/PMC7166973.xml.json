Primary infection during pregnancy poses a 30\u201340% risk of intrauterine transmission, with severe adverse outcomes more likely if the infection occurs within the first trimester gestation. Due to strict viral host specificity, so far there is no animal model of HCMV infection available. Current state of knowledge of CMV pathogenesis and host defense against HCMV has come largely from clinical observation and in vitro studies with cell lines or primary human cells [Sinzger and Jahn, 1996].",

It was reported that astrocytes constitute important parts of host defense mechanism, and play important roles in preserving CNS (central nervous system) function and protecting CNS against infectious agents [Carson and Sutcliffe, 1999]. That HCMV or its proteins modulate gene expression in astrocytes has also been investigated. After being infected by HCMV, astrocytes produce as well as respond to a number of immune mediators, including interferon, ISG (interferon\u2010stimulated gene) proteins, cytokines, and chemokines [Grandvaux et al., 2002] to control the spread of invading HCMV.",

            "text": "Type I IFN and ISG proteins have been shown to possess antiviral properties in CNS. Early expression of cytokines in CNS has been demonstrated to correlate with the control of viral replication [Carson and Sutcliffe, 1999]. When virus contact with host cells, viral proteins and nucleic acids are detected by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) as pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Subsequently, the signal transduction pathways are activated. Type I IFN and production of other cytokines are triggered. Type I IFN then augments the expression of several ISGs and subverts virus replication by a variety of mechanisms [Poland et al., 1994; Peisley and Hur, 2013]. However, not all ISGs are induced in IFN\u2010dependent manner. Some are induced in IRF3\u2010dependent manner [Grandvaux et al., 2002]. Moreover, not all ISG proteins confer direct antiviral effects, and the anti\u2010HCMV effects of ISG proteins have not been attributed to every ISG family members so far characterized. Inhibitory phenotypes directed at specific ISG proteins need to be studied for HCMV. Given the observed replication of the virus in the presence of multiple antiviral host proteins, it is probable that a number of ISG\u2010inhibitory phenotypes are to be uncovered for HCMV [Munir, 2013; Peisley and Hur, 2013]; studies on ISG protein against HCMV infection were carried out using either cell lines or mature astrocytes, which do not mimic the natural course of HCMV infection and there are many gaps to be filled in the understanding of host defense against HCMV infection in CNS. To overcome these limitations, we used human fetal astrocytes of the first trimester gestation to investigate the antiviral effects of ISG proteins, with expectation of developing a targeting therapy without therapy\u2010limiting side effects of IFNs.",

            "text": "IFIT1 (Interferon\u2010induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) is one of the identified ISGs [Wathelet et al., 1986; Levy et al., 2004]. All members in IFIT family contain multiple tetratricopeptide motifs that are known to mediate protein\u2013protein interactions through scaffolds formed among tandem TPR repeats [Lamb et al., 1995]. IFIT1 is induced in response to type I IFNs stimulation, presence of double\u2010stranded RNAs, and virus infection [Guo et al., 2000; Terenzi et al., 2006]. IFIT1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF\u20103, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis. IFIT1 has been implicated to have similar antiviral effects as IFNs in fighting against West Nile virus and LCMV [Wacher et al., 2007]. It is also reported to inhibit human papillomavirus DNA replication by binding to the viral protein E1 [Terenzi et al., 2008]; studies demonstrated that the 2\u2032\u2010O methylation of the 5\u2032 cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT\u2010mediated suppression [Daffis et al., 2010]; It was discovered that IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA via a 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate group (PPP\u2010RNA), and lend insight into their downstream effector function [Pichlmair et al., 2011; Abbas et al., 2013]. Recently, it was reported that ISG54 and ISG56 may contribute to immune and inflammatory reactions elicited by TLR3/IFN\u2010\u03b2 signaling pathway in astrocytes, and may play an important role both in antiviral immunity and in neuroinflammatory diseases [Imaizumi et al., 2014]. However, little has been reported to date on the protective mechanism of IFIT1 against HCMV infection.",

These probes consist of 60\u2010mers isothermal oligonucleotides, which show more robust hybridization than shorter oligonucleotides. The NimbleGen human expression array (Format: 12 \u00d7 135k; Source: NCBI; Build: HG18, Build 36; Probe Length: 60 mer; Genes: 45033; Probes/Target: 3; Replicates: 1) involves 45,033 gene transcripts (i.e., different accession numbers corresponding to the same or different isoforms). DNA end\u2010labeling, hybridization, scanning, and data normalization were performed at NimbleGen, which provided the final data file. Array hybridization using the NimbleGen Hybridization System followed by washing with the NimbleGen wash buffer kit and Array scanning using the Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) were conducted. Scanned images were then imported into NimbleScan software (version 2.5) for grid alignment and expression data analysis. Expression data were normalized through quantile normalization and the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm included in the NimbleScan software. The Probe level files and Gene level files were generated after normalization. All gene level files were imported into Agilent GeneSpring GX software (version 11.5.1) for further analysis. Genes that at least nine out of nine samples greater than or equal to lower cut\u2010off: 50.0 were chosen for data analysis. Differentially expressed genes between two samples were identified through Fold Change filtering. Differentially expressed genes between two groups were identified through Volcano Plot filtering. A set of genes presenting an average of at least twofold induction/repression calculated from the different probes specific for each gene spotted on the NimbleGen chip were selected for promoter analysis. GO analysis were applied to determine the roles of these differentially expressed genes played in these biological GO terms.",

As one gene is often represented by several transcripts, we focused only on those genes represented by two or more transcripts and displaying a mean fold difference \u22652.0 and t\u2010test P\u2010value <0.05. With these criteria, we found that about 154 genes, including 138 up\u2010regulated and 16 down\u2010regulated, were modulated at 6 hr p.i. Gene expressions with more than 10\u2010fold change were shown in Table I. To verify the results, the mRNA expression of up\u2010regulated genes IFIT1, MXA, MXB, CCL5, CXCL2, BST2, IL8, IL11 at 6 hr p.i vs con and astrocyte genes GFAP and Vim were confirmed by qRT\u2010PCR (Fig. 1B). A good correlation was found between the two analyses, although almost all genes had higher FC values in qRT\u2010PCR than in microarray analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the top five categories in biological process all belonged to cell response to stimuli, indicating the role of astrocytes against virus infection at 6 hr p.i (Table II).",

The symptoms of primary HCMV infection in healthy adults are generally mild, but infection during first trimester gestation can lead to serious neurodevelopment sequelea in infants. Fetal CNS is especially vulnerable to CMV\u2010induced injury [Poland et al., 1994; McCarthy et al., 2000]. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type found in the CNS, outnumbering neurons 10\u20101. These glial cells have the capacity to react to a variety of CNS disturbances such as viral infection through the production of immune mediators and it is well established that primary human astrocytes are fully permissive for CMV replication [Ho et al., 1991; Lokensgard et al., 1999]. Host antiviral responses to HCMV begin quickly after virus\u2010cell contact involving interaction with a growing list of pattern recognition receptors that initiate intracellular signaling and consequent expression and secretion of numerous immunologically active cytokines.",

            "text": "In this study, HCMV infected human fetal astrocytes were studied for the effects HCMV on genome transcription of astrocytes and antiviral activity of astrocytes. Firstly, we performed genome wide gene expression of HCMV infected human fetal astrocytes in vitro. With a 2.0\u2010fold change as a cutoff, it showed HCMV infection led to extensive dysregulation of cellular gene expression in astrocytes. One hundred and fifty\u2010four gene expressions (138 up\u2010regulated, 16 down\u2010regulated) were modulated in HCMV infected astrocytes compared with mock infected group at 6 hr p.i. GO analysis showed the top five categories in biological process and all belonged to cell response to stimuli (Table II). ISGs involved in antiviral response process in early infection time [Ho and van den Pol, 2007] exhibited the highest fold changes in HCMV infected astrocytes compared with mock infected group at 6 hr p.i. However, this result was not consistent with the finding that microglia not astrocytes could produce antiviral cytokines in response to CMV infection [Lokensgard et al., 2002]. The reason could be that the response to HCMV infection in fetal astrocytes was different from mature astrocytes or cell lines. These up\u2010regulated ISGs included IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, MXA, MXB, OAS1, OAS2, OASL, USP18, USP41, IFI44, and BST2. It also showed that gene expression levels of chemokine and chemokine receptors (IL\u201011, MCP\u20101, IL\u20108, RANTES, IP\u201010, and MIP\u20101\u03b1, Table III) were up\u2010regulated compared to mock infected group at 6 hr p.i. This result was consistent with the report that CMV\u2010infected human brain vascular pericytes and astrocytes released substantial amounts of the chemokines MCP\u20101, MIP\u20101\u03b1, and IL\u20108 [Lokensgard et al., 2002; Alcendor et al., 2012]. Several studies have demonstrated that chemokine play important roles in regulating brain inflammation during viral encephalitis because of their chemotactic properties, and the importance of CCL5, CCL3, CCL4, IL\u201011, IL\u20108, and MCP\u20101 in regulating immune responses in the CNS have been emphasized [Weiss et al., 1998; Kutsch et al., 2000; Zlotnik, 2000]. Our results showed different fold changes of these cytokines and chemokines in HCMV infected astrocytes (Table III). Additionally, it has also been reported that early local expression of cytokines with antiviral properties in the CNS such as TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, and IFN\u0263 correlates with control of viral replication. IFN treatment induces the expression of a large set of IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs), whose protein products prevent infection with many pathogens, including HCMV [Samuel, 2001]. In present study, the results showed different fold changes with IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20108, IL\u20106 in HCMV infected astrocytes compared with mock infected group at 6 hr p.i, while TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, or IFN\u0263 exhibited little gene expression level in HCMV or mock infected astrocytes and fold changes were no statistical significance in HCMV infected astrocytes compared with mock infected control. The results suggested that HCMV infected astrocytes defended themselves against HCMV infection through expressing of ISGs, cytokines, and chemokines which either exert direct antiviral activities, or recruit antiviral immune cells such as microglia to the sites of infection [Peterson et al., 1997] and ISGs exerted important role in antiviral action. However, it is also plausible that only a subset of ISGs is essential for protection against a specific pathogen or groups of related pathogens. Thus, identification of pathogen\u2010specific ISGs might lead to development of targeted therapeutics.",

Overexpression Lentivirus lv/IFIT1/EGFP gene was transduced into astrocytes or HELFs, respectively. Cells were infected with HCMV AD169 for 72 hr. Cell appearance showed no change in lv/IFIT1/EGFP transduced astrocytes compared with lv/ctl/EGFP transduced control group at 72 hr p.i, while morphological changes were observed in lv/IFIT1/EGFP and lv/ctl/EGFP transduced HELFs. The different antiviral effects of IFIT1 on astrocytes and HELFs might be caused different expression of cellular factors, which may be responsible for the modulation of viral gene expression [Towler et al., 2012], and reinforce the reason to investigate the specific antiviral replication role of IFIT1 in fetal astrocytes. Furthermore, mRNA expression of IE1, IE2, and pp65 were detected by QRT\u2010PCR at 4, 6, 12 hr p.i and protein expression were detected by western blot at 24, 48 hr p.i, due to the delayed expression of protein compared to mRNA. The results showed that both mRNA and protein expressions were significantly reduced compared with lv/ctl/EGFP transduced control (P < 0.001). HCMV replication cycle in fetal astrocytes was 48\u201372 hr (showed in our previous study). Therefore, the release of HCMV infectious particles in cell culture medium and HCMV titer within astrocytes were determined at 48 and 72 hr p.i. The results showed significant decreases in the release of HCMV infectious particles in cell culture medium and in HCMV titer within astrocytes in lv/IFIT1/EGFP transduced astrocytes compared with the control (P < 0.001).",

After shIFIT1\u20101 lentivirus was transduced into astrocytes for 48 hr, cells were infected with HCMV AD169. Viral mRNA, protein expression levels and HCMV titers were determined, which showed significant increases in mRNA expressions of IE1, IE2, pp65, and viral titers in knockdown group compared with the control (P < 0.01), suggesting the antiviral replication effects of IFIT1 in fetal astrocytes. This is the first report on antiviral effects of IFIT1 in human fetal astrocytes to date and these findings also pointed to the potential importance of studying human primary first\u2010trimester gestation astrocytes because the antiviral effects of particular cytokines depend on specific cell surface receptors that may not be present or functional on established glial cell lines.",

            "text": "Functional studies have shown that IFITs inhibit the translation of viral proteins via different mechanisms. In early studies, IFITs were found to bind eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and interfere with viral protein translation [Hui et al., 2003]. Recent studies showed that IFITs can distinguish the different features between host and viral RNAs, block West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and coronavirus mutants that lack 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase activity. Inhibition by IFIT1 occurs by preferentially sequestering capped RNA lacking a 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl group and preventing eukaryotic translation initiation factors from binding to the RNA template specifically [Daffis et al., 2010; Habjan et al., 2013; Kimura et al., 2013]. IFIT1 was also identified as an eIF3\u2010associated protein fractionating with hepatitis C virus (HCV) translation complexes in IFN\u2010treated cells [Wang et al., 2003]. IFIT1 blocks translation driven by the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the inhibition depends on eIF3 binding by IFIT1. However, another study suggested IFIT1 preferentially inhibits cap\u2010dependent translation but not translation of the EMCV IRES [Hui et al., 2003], since the EMCV IRES is different from that of HCV and functions by a different mechanism. IFIT1 also inhibits human papillomavirus DNA replication by binding to the viral protein E1 [Terenzi et al., 2008]. Nevertheless, several important questions still remain to be addressed. Our data verified that IFIT1 possessed anti\u2010HCMV function by inhibiting virus replication in human fetal astrocytes. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. There are possibilities that IFIT1 inhibits DNA replication by binding to the viral protein, or by suppressing HCMV protein translation by binding eIF3. It will be interesting to ponder new information on the uncovered the processes described here and on how to exploit for novel clinical antiviral or therapeutic strategies. Further studies are necessary to look into the precise role of this effector molecule.",
