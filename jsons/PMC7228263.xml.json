The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Europe is 30 307, of which 1206 have died. A total of 21 194 cases have been confirmed in Asia (excluding China), with 545 deaths. The clinical manifestations of COVID\u201019 are similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broken out in 2003, which has longer latency and stronger infectivity. This has led to severe shortages of medical resources and infections of health care workers. Peng et al reported 138 patients were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, including 40 medical staff (29%).\n2\n Another retrospective analysis of 1099 confirmed patients with COVID\u201019 (the diagnosis date is up to January 29) in 552 hospitals from 31 provinces found that the proportion of health professionals was 2.09%.\n3\n Various indications have shown that medical staff infections are at an unavoidable risk of infection. Besides, little is known on the infection status of the medical staff currently hospitalized, and their basic demographic characteristics, disease severity distribution, computed tomography (CT) image characteristics, and treatment status.",

Two of the 54 medical staff (from the medical technology department and other departments respectively) have a history of close contact with the staff outside the hospital, and the remaining 52 staff have no history of contact with the staff outside the hospital. We all know that new coronary pneumonia is highly contagious, and medical staff have more opportunities to closely contact patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019. Therefore, medical staff at Tongji Hospital have been arranged to live in designated hotels and have no chance to be with other staff.",

The throat swab was placed into a collection tube with virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted using two different respiratory sample RNA isolation kits approved by the Food and Drug Administration of China (Huirui and Bojie, Shanghai, China). Two target genes, including the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), were simultaneously amplified by real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). The reaction mixture consisted of 7.5 \u03bcL reaction buffer, 1.5 \u03bcL enzyme solution, 5 \u03bcL ORF1ab/N gene reaction solution, 5 to 11 \u03bcL RNA template, and 25 \u03bcL RNase free pure water. The RT\u2010PCR reactions were subjected to 50\u00b0C for 15 minutes, incubation at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 45 cycles for 10 seconds, and fluorescence signal acquisition at 55\u00b0C for 45 seconds. Target gene test was that ORF1ab gene was detected by FAM channel, and N gene was detected by HEX/VIC channel. Negative: C\nt > 38 or not detected; positive: the amplification curve was s\u2010shaped, and the C\nt value was \u226435; suspicious: the amplification curve was s\u2010shaped, and 35 < C\nt \u2264 38, requiring reexamination; If the reexamination results are consistent, the determination results are positive for the nucleic acid test of the gene. In addition, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid test positive interpretation criteria are divided into two aspects, first, in the same specimen, ORF1ab and N genes tested positive at the same time; second, the ORF1ab or N gene was positive in two different samples of the same patient. These diagnostic criteria are based on the recommendations of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China).",

Of note, severe\u2010/critical\u2010type patients were featured by the higher severity of lymphadenia (29.3% vs 9.1%) and interstitial thickening (7.3% vs 0%) but with no significant difference. Furthermore, significantly higher proportion of patients positive for SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 tests displayed patchy shadow (19/36, 52.8%) in the CT\u2010cans than that of patients negative for the tests (3/16, 18.8%, P = .022). Analysis of the lesion sites in CT\u2010scans revealed that those severe\u2010/critical\u2010type of patients were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P = \u00b7012) of upper lobe or right lung (31.7% vs 0%; P = \u00b7028) (Table 2).",

            "text": "At the press conference on \u201cjoint prevention and control of COVID\u201019\u201d by the State Council of China, Ceng Yixin, deputy director of the National Health Commission, declared that as of 24:00 on 11 February, 1716 cases of COVID\u201019 had been confirmed in medical staff across the country, accounting for 3.8% of all confirmed cases, among them, six had died, accounting for 0.4% of national deaths. Among the 1716 cases, 1502 cases were in Hubei Province, and 1102 cases in Wuhan City. Wuhan Tongji Hospital in Hubei is the largest Grade\u2010A Tertiary Hospital, which provided the most beds during the battle against the epidemic. This study analyzed the 54 medical staff infections in Tongji Hospital from 7 January to 11 February 2020, including 2 cases (3.7%) from first\u2010line departments, 39 cases (72.2%) from non\u2010first\u2010line departments, 10 (18.5%) from medical medical technology departments, and 3 (5.6%) from administrative and logistics departments. Such pattern of distribution was similar to that reported by Wang et al\n2\n on 7 February 2020, which indicated that among the 40 medical staff infections, 31 (77.5%) worked in general wards, 7 (17.5%) in emergency room, and 2 (5%) in intensive care unit. Analysis of onset time suggested that earliest infections occurred in the emergency department, which began to show symptoms on 7 January 2020, and the other cases showed symptoms mostly from 22 January to 3 February 2020, then from 4 February on, number of new cases gradually decreased. The causes of such pattern of medical staff infection may include: firstly, the COVID\u201019 has many atypical clinical manifestations, so the patients may go to different departments for treatment. As the disease may be contagious during the incubation period,\n5\n, \n6\n many medical staff are not adequately protected and become infected via unwitting contact with the patients. Second, it is important to note there were not sufficient reserves of protective equipment in the hospital for a pandemic of such severity. The protective equipment, such as protective clothing, N95 masks, and goggles are prioritized to first\u2010line medical staff in fever clinics and fever wards, while other staff often have only surgical masks at best, which explains the lower infection rates in medical staff directly facing the infected than medical staff who are less exposed. Third, according to the article by Wang et al\n2\n on 7 February 2020, among the 138 cases admitted by Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, 17 cases (12.3%) were hospitalized for reasons other than pneumonia, such as conditions that requires surgery and tumors, including 7 cases in the surgery department, 5 cases in the internal medicine department, and 5 cases in the oncology department. These cases may even have been infected during hospitalization. As patients in hospital frequently contact inpatient caregivers and visitors that frequently go in and out of hospital and are at high risk of getting infected, which exacerbates infections of medical staff not in direct contact with the known infected patients. Fourth, the infected medical staff may be asymptomatic but infectious, which may lead to clustered infection in a department.\n7\n\n",

            "text": "Another notable feature of the medical staff infections by COVID\u201019 in Tongji Hospital, was the high rate of severe and critical cases. The 54 cases included 40 severe cases and 3 critical cases (79% in total), a ratio much higher than what's reported on the N Engl J MED by Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital,\n8\n in which only 32% of the 41 hospitalized patients were severe or critical cases. Another unusual feature of the 54 cases was that the 11 common cases were 47 years old on average, while the 43 severe and critical cases were 38 years old on average\u2014the common\u2010type cases were significantly elder than the severe or critical cases, which was contrary to what's reported by Huang et al and Wang et al\n1\n Such contradiction may be explained by (a) the lower ratio of elder people among the medical staff; (b) the longer work time and higher work intensity of the medical staff aged 38 years or so, as they are the mainstay of a hospital. However, the latter is currently only based on empirical assumption and not supported by quantitative analysis.",

Similarly, Goh et al\n9\n reported that severe consolidation in SARS occurred in the upper right lobe of patients. Wong et al\n10\n reported 108 cases of SARS patients, in which right lung involvement (82/108, 75.9%) was more common, these results are exactly the same as our statistical results. It is worthwhile to further explore the mechanism of this phenomenon, which ca make us identify the severe and critical cases in medical staff. In Hubei, the epicenter, many patients had positive CT images but showed negative results in the nucleic acid test.\n11\n To better address such patients, on 13 February 2020, the General Office of the National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine issued the guideline \u201cClinical Diagnosis of COVID\u201019 (Fifth Edition on trial),\u201d\n4\n which added \u201cclinical diagnosed\u201d to the classification of the new coronavirus\u2010infected pneumonia. The \u201cclinical diagnosed\u201d classification refers to cases that had characteristic clinical manifestations of infection but were negative in the nucleic acid test. We compared the nucleic acid\u2010positive and \u2010negative cases, and found that the two groups showed no significant differences in age, gender, or symptoms, but the former had a higher ratio of patchy shadows on CT images than the latter (19/36, 52.8% vs 3/16, 18.8%). As most of the patients are still hospitalized at the time of submission, we can hardly evaluate the significance of nucleic acid test results in prognosis, which require further observation of the natural history of the disease.",

Medical staff of 38 years old or so shall receive extra care and protection due to their susceptibility to severe infection, and when a medical personal is infected, changes in right lung and upper right lobe should be noticed for earlier detection of severe cases.",
