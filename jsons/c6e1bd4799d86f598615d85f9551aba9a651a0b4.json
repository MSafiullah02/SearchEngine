In Hong Kong, Lee and colleagues (2007) found one year after the outbreak of SARS that HCWs had higher levels of posttraumatic stress, depression and anxiety compared to non-HCWs. A study from China (Lai et al., 2020) found that a substantial number of HCWs who treated COVID-19 patients suffered from depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress.",

They received a link to the survey, which was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Royal Hospital in Oman. The survey consisted of sociodemographic questions and three well-established scales: (1) The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), consisting of 10 items with five responses ranging from 0 = Never to 4 = Very often. A high score signifies a high level of stress. (2) The Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale (GAD-7), consisting of seven items with 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = Not at all to 3 = Nearly every day. A high score signifies a high level of anxiety and a score of \u226510 is indicative of the presence of anxiety. (3) The WHO Well-being Index (WHO-5), a five-item scale that gauges psychological well-being. Items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = None of the time to 5 = All the time. Scores on the WHO-5 are changed to a percentage by multiplying them by 4. The transformed scale ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible well-being. Scores \u2264 50 are indicative of poor psychological well-being that warrants screening for depression (Rauwerda et al., 2018) . The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the three measures were .88, .90, and .92, respectively.",

An independent-samples t test showed a significant influence of gender on the PSS-10 scores (t = 2.32, p = .02, Cohen's d = .34).

Marital status (married vs. non-married) had no impact on the GAD-7 scores (\u03c7 2 (1) = .57, p = .29). also, age was not related to the overall scores on the GAD-7 (r = -.08, p = .33). The mean score on the WHO-5 was low (M = 52.47, SD = 22.94). More females scored \u226450, the cutoff for poor psychological well-being, than males (\u03c7 2 (1) = 4.45, p = .03). Also, more physicians who worked with COVID-19 patients scored \u226450 than those who did not (\u03c7 2 (1) = 3.12, p = .05). Marital status was not related to WHO-5 scores. Age was significantly positively correlated with the WHO-5 score (r = .25, p = .003). Lastly, we conducted a multiple linear regression analysis to assess the influence of the PSS-10 and GAD-7 on physicians' psychological well-being. The model explained 72% (R 2 = .52) of the variance in the reported wellbeing scores (F (2, 191) = 104.63, p = .000). Both the PSS-10 (\u03b2 = -.40, t (193) = 6.18, p = .000) and the GAD-7 (\u03b2 = -.40, t (193) = 6.22, p = .000) significantly predicted physicians' scores on the Who-5 Well-Being index.",

Females reported more stress than did males. Two in three female physicians reported a low level of psychological well-being, compared to one in three male physicians. Older physicians experienced greater well-being and a lower level of stress compared to younger ones. Married physicians reported less stress than non-married ones. It seemed, however, that physicians experienced similar amounts of anxiety regardless of their gender and contact with COVID-19 patients. Both stress and anxiety had a strong effect on the overall well-being of physicians. To minimize the impact of COVID-19related mental and physical health issues, we recommend that health facilities, especially ones that receive COVID-19 patients, set up counseling services for HCWs. Equally, health care providers should be cognizant of their own signs of mental health issues and seek help.",
