The airborne carrier for the COVID-19 can be tiny droplets and particulates from infected person, fine suspended mists (humidity) in air, or ambient aerosols in air. To-date, unfortunately there are no test standards for nano-aerosols (\u2264100 nm). A goal in our study is to develop air filters (e.g. respirator, facemask, ventilator, medical breathing filter/system) with 90% capture on 100-nm airborne COVID-19 with pressure drop of less than 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). There are two challenges. First, this airborne bio-nanoaerosol (combined virus and carrier) is amorphous unlike cubic NaCl crystals. Second, unlike standard laboratory tests on NaCl and test oil (DOP) droplets, these polydispersed aerosols all challenge the filter simultaneously and they are of different sizes and can interact among themselves complicating the filtration process. For the first time, we have studied these two effects using ambient aerosols (simulating the bio-nanoaerosols of coronavirus plus carrier of different shapes and sizes) to challenge electrostatically charged multilayer/multimodule nanofiber filters. This problem is fundamentally complicated due to mechanical and electrostatic interactions among aerosols of different sizes with induced charges of different magnitudes.",

This configuration minimized electrical interference among neighboring charged nanofibers and reduced flow resistance in the filter. For ambient aerosol size > 80 nm (applicable to the smallest COVID-19), the electrostatic effect contributes 100-180% more efficiency to the existing mechanical efficiency (due to diffusion and interception) depending on the number of modules in the filter. By stacking-up modules to increase fiber basis weight in the filter, a 6-layer charged nanofiber filter achieved 88%, 88% and 96% filtration efficiency for, respectively, 55-nm, 100-nm and 300-nm ambient aerosol. This is very close to attaining our set goal of 90%-efficiency on the 100-nm ambient aerosol. The pressure drop for the 6-layer nanofiber filter was only 26 Pa (2.65 mm water column) which was below our limit of 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). For the test multi-module filters, a high 'quality factor' (efficiency-to-pressuredrop ratio) of about 0.1 to 0.13 Pa \u22121 can be consistently maintained, which was far better than conventional filters.",

The 2-6% discrepancy in efficiency for the NaCl aerosols was primarily attributed to the absence of interaction among aerosols of different sizes using monodispersed NaCl aerosols in the laboratory. This discrepancy can be further reduced with increasing number of modules in the filter and for larger 300-nm aerosol. The 6-layer charged nanofiber filter was qualified as a 'N98 respirator' (98% capture efficiency for 300-nm NaCl aerosols) but with pressure drop of only 2.65-mm water which was 1/10 below conventional N95 with 25-mm (exhaling) to 35-mm (inhaling) water column! The 6-layer charged PVDF nanofiber filter provides good personal protection against airborne COVID-19 virus and nano-aerosols from pollution based on the N98 standard, yet it is at least 10X more breathable than a conventional N95 respirator.",

COVID-19 belongs to the coronavirus family for which their family members, SARS and MERS, are also well known. SARS virus has a size of about 81 \u00b1 11 nm [2, 3] with the virus capsid wrapped by at least 15 spikes [2] . MERS virus has a spherical shape with size of 118-136 nm and has spikes 16-21 nm on its surface [4] . Under scanning electron microscope (SEM), the spikes of the virus appear as a corona wrapping around the virus [1] for which the coronavirus was given the name. The virus spikes (largely protein) are used for anchoring to its carrier and host cells. Some viruses, such as the coronavirus, have more prominent spikes than others. The familiar Influenza virus, which affects many and lead to numerous deaths during the flu season, has majority size of about 120 nm [5] and it too has spikes, which are less conspicuous. One of the influenzas, Influenza A has a size of 100 nm [6] . All these viruses can be aerosolized as they can be attached to fine aerosols (solid particle or droplet) from infected person, but the coronavirus is better equipped with prominent spikes for better anchorage to their carriers during transport as well as their host cells. Once airborne, there is possibility that they can be transferred to ambient aerosols during their flight as well. The smaller the aerosol that the virus is attached to, the longer that the combined aerosol (virus and carrier aerosol) is suspended in air or airborne, the longer distance for which the virus can spread. Similar phenomenon can be found in air pollution in that the finer the particulates, the longer they are suspended in air, and further they can travel.",

This size is known as the most penetrating particle size (MPPS). For filters using fiber diameter different from microfibers with 2-15 \u00b5m fiber diameter, MPPS with the minimum efficiency or most penetration size may not correspond to 300 nm.",

            "text": "Ambient aerosols have a wide range of sizes from emission of diesel and gasoline vehicles with virgin size, typically 10-100 nm. These particles collide and agglomerate in size to larger aerosols. However, the shear force generating from by-passing vehicles breaks down the agglomerates reducing them to smaller size. As such, there is an equilibrium size distribution due to balance of agglomeration and attrition on aerosol size. The median size of this distribution has been found to be about 80 nm in heavy traffic area [8] . In addition, another contribution to ambient aerosol is from photochemical reaction of gases in the atmosphere, generating fine aerosols 20-50 nm. Close to the ocean, water vapor under high humidity can condense under high relative humidity back to fine water droplets/mists that can be ultrafine with size below 100 nm. As can be seen, these are all nano-aerosol with size less than 100 nm. Therefore, ambient air can have aerosolsbelow 100 nm and of course larger aerosols. They are irregular shape, with some composition of fine water droplets, especially in locations near the open water. Given ambient aerosols have both high concentration of nano-aerosols (less than100 nm) and larger aerosols (> 100 nm), they are good candidates in filter testing for use to simulate the combined aerosol, i.e. coronavirus with carrier aerosol. The drawback is that ambient aerosols may change over time and does not provide a stable source of aerosols. When tests are carried out within a short period, and the filtration efficiency is based on the ratio of the filter upstream and downstream aerosol concentrations, it should not be affect significantly. Using ambient aerosols for filter testing would be satisfactory once these limitations are well observed. However, we need to pay heed to the fact that the concentration of the challenging aerosol should not be too low, which might affect the accuracy of the result.",

            "text": "1. Very few literatures address filtrating of irregular shape ambient aerosols, and it is the objective of the present study to use ambient aerosols to represent the airborne virus with the carrier as ambient aerosols are present in high concentration in the surroundings and they can potentially be the carrier of viruses. Unlike NaCl crystals and DOP, can ambient aerosols with different physical properties and irregular shape be effectively electrostatically charged before capture (i.e. dielectrophoresis)? 2. In laboratory testing, only one aerosol size (i.e. monodispersed) is used to challenge the filter at a given time, there is no interaction of different aerosol sizes challenging the filter. For ambient aerosol all sizes of aerosols challenge the filter at the same time. There may be complicated interactions of the charged aerosols of different sizes prior to their capture by the charged fiber despite this may take place at close distance to the charged fiber. 3. Smaller aerosols will have smaller induced dipoles which lead to lower capture in comparison to the larger aerosols. What aerosol size range does the electrostatic force act most effectively? 4. Typically, the efficiency for charged microfiber filter increases monotonically with increasing aerosol size. The efficiency versus aerosol size curve does not exhibit a U-shape characteristic. This is because the electrostatic capture dominates over the mechanical capture by diffusion and interception with large diameter fiber (> 1 \u00b5m). It would be interesting to see if nanofiber filter with diameter only a fraction of a micrometer also has similar characteristics. Because the diffusion capture mechanism is much stronger for the nanofibers as compared to the conventional microfibers, the efficiency characteristics with aerosol size might be different. 5. When the basis weight is increased in a filter, the increased in pressure usually is much more than the increase in efficiency. This is especially with high efficiency filter. It would be interesting to investigate whether the multimodule/multilayering approach can maintain a constant ratio of benefit-to-cost, i.e. constant QF (to be defined later). 6. What would be the configuration of the multilayer filter to achieve 90% capture for the 100 nm, 60 nm and even 300 nm aerosols (simulating various possible sizes of the COVID-19 with carrier) with pressure drop not to exceed 30 Pa (3.1 mm water)?",

The typical ingredient for the precursor solution was 20% g of PVDF solute in 100 mL of solution (20 %w/v). The well-mixed precursor solution was fed to a syringe connected to a high voltage supply of 20,000 V. The ground collector was placed at 15 cm from the syringe tip. A control amount of PVDF solution (0.9 mL/h) was delivered by the syringe using the syringe pump to establish a droplet at the syringe tip. Under the strong electrostatic field, the droplet took on the shape of a Taylor cone. Once the electrostatic force acting on the cone-shape droplet has overcome the surface tension force acting on the droplet, a jet was sent out through the cone-shape droplet towards the collector. During free flight, the jet continued to thin out in diameter as the solvent was continuously being evaporated and the 'positive' electrical charges deposited along the jet repelled against each other thereby further stretching out the fiber jet and reducing the fiber diameter. By the time when the fiber jet landed onto the substrate laid over the collector surface, the fiber reduced in diameter corresponding to a nanofiber (\u226a1\u03bcm). To get a uniform nanofiber mat, a rotating drum collector was used with rotation speed of 10 rev/min. The humidity during electrospinning was maintained at 40 \u00b1 2% to control the evaporation rate. The electrospinning process is depicted in Fig. 1a . The nanofiber mat was dried in an oven overnight at 40\u00b0C for curing to allow residual solvent to be evaporated.",

Downstream of the filter holders, the stream was directed to a common ball valve that can select flow from either holder to the vacuum pump with a slip stream being taken out for measuring aerosol concentration. A Portable Aerosols Mobility Spectrometer (PAMS) was used to measure the number concentration of a given stream. The size range of aerosols that can be measured was between 10 and 433 nm. When the ball valve was switched directing airflow from the blank holder, the concentration-size measurement corresponded to that of the unfiltered ambient aerosols, C u (D p ). On the other hand, concentration of the filtered stream C d (D p ) can be measured when the ball valve was directing the airflow downstream of the holder that has an installed filter.

Aerosols were also generated from the photochemical oxidation of pollutants gases (NOx and hydrocarbon gases). Also, in 20 m from the test rig, a small fountain generated water spray that became fine mist due to evaporation during hot weather when the test was carried out with temperature of 30\u00b0C and relative humidity of 90%. The mist served as fine water droplets simulating those from the infected person as well as from the humidity in ambient.

            "text": "The equations discussed in the foregoing will be used in the next section for making comparison with test results. Fig. 2b shows the fiber diameter distribution of our test sample using a count of 100 fibers from various samples. As can be seen in Fig. 2b , the mean fiber diameter is 525 \u00b1 191 nm. About 80% of all the fibers are within the one standard deviation, i.e. between 334 nm and 716 nm. There are some smaller fibers 150 -350 nm that can improve filtration while the larger fibers provide mechanical strength/ support and low pressure drop for the filter, see Fig. 2a . Fig. 3 shows the typical log-normal distribution on size of the ambient aerosols (expressed in aerodynamic diameter as converted from electrical mobility diameter similar to the analysis made in Ref. [8] ). The median size of the measured ambient aerosols was 70 nm with size range that spanned 10 to 433 nm. The peak value was 85.86 count/cm 3 at 83.81 nm and about 80% of the total particle concentration was within the range of 30-200 nm. There was a large percentage of aerosols under 100 nm falling into the category of nano-aerosols. As mentioned, COVID-19 has a size range of 60 to 140 nm with average of 100 nm, and they can be aerosolized by attaching to carrier particles (solid or fine liquid droplet) from the infected person. The bio-nanoaerosol (virus and nuclei) under airborne can be modified in size, through evaporation and re-attachment to other aerosols in air. The evaporation rate depends on the relative humidity of the environment. In cold and dry environment, the size of the fine mist/droplet can be reduced significantly by evaporation. This implies that the aerosol can become smaller in size during free flight and it can be carried farther in distance similar to that of the nano-sized pollutants from combustion emsission. In any event, the smallest aerosol is 60 nm and the aerosol size can be larger. Here, in our subsequent study we will examine the filtration efficiency of nano-aerosol, i.e. 100 nm aerosol. This also corresponds to the average size of SARS virus and influenza virus (80-120 nm), and it is slightly smaller than the measles virus (120-250 nm), which is a well-known airborne virus. In all cases, these nano-aerosol viruses can be aerosolized and become airborne when anchored to a carrier. The test efficiency from filtration using a 2-layer (2L) uncharged and charged PVDF filter is shown in Fig. 4 . The open-square symbols represent the filtration of 2L uncharged filter with 1.53gsm (2X0.765gsm) of PVDF nanofibers. Of interest is that the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), corresponding to the minimum efficiency, is about 150 nm. As can be seen, there is a distinct U-shape behavior showing diffusion capture being effective for aerosols < 150 nm, while interception is effective for aerosols > 150 nm. The experimental set-up was valid up to 400 nm at which incoming aerosol concentration was low and deduced efficiency became unreliable. The model for mechanical capture Eqs. (1)- (14) was used to predict performance and this was included as a dotted curve in Fig. 4 for making comparison with the test results. As seen, the comparison between experiment and theoretical prediction is reasonable. Bear in mind that, unlike laboratory testing for which only one test aerosol size is 'allowed' to challenge the filter at a given time, here aerosols of all sizes challenged the filter simultaneously. The interaction of aerosols of different sizes before being captured by the filter can be extremely complex. Given the reasonable agreement between experiment and prediction, we can only conclude that the theory is approximately correct despite there was mechanical interaction of aerosols of different sizes during filtration. This is also in accord with the earlier test work using PVA nanofibers for mechanical filtration [8] .",

            "text": "With charged 2L filter having the same basis weight of 1.53 gsm as the uncharged filter studied previously, the test results are shown by the solid square symbols in Fig. 4 . Interestingly, a U-shape curve is also evident from the experimental data. Unlike with charged microfiber filter, for which a typical efficiency curve is monotonically increasing with increasing aerosol size, here with charged nanofiber filter, a flatter U-shape curve is clearly seen. The reason for this difference with the microfiber filter is that nanofiber filter has a very strong diffusion behavior for small aerosols unlike the case of microfiber filter where diffusion is much subdued. Charged microfiber filter replies mainly on electrostatic effect as their diffusion capture is relatively weak, while charged nanofiber filter is strong in both diffusion and electrostatic for aerosol capture. The MPPS has been shifted to 70 nm instead of the 150 nm and the efficiency at MPPS is elevated from 24% to 48% (prediction) and more like 58% (actual data). This again is courtesy of the electrostatic capture by dielectrophoresis. Using the single fiber efficiency model Eq. (15), we matched the theoretical model Eqs. 1, 3-16 with experimental data. A good match is with the parameters a = 1.0(10 11 ) m \u22121 s \u22121 and b = 0.6. Indeed, b also matches well with previous finding of 0.4 -0.6 [12] whereas the value of a is higher. The single fiber dielectrophoresis efficiency as given by Eq. (15) with a = 1.0(10 11 ) m -1 s \u22121 and b = 0.6 is shown in Fig. 5 . It is a simple power law function that depends on the parameter, Z = C n D p 2 /u [9, [11] [12] [13] . The functional dependence on this group of variables have been verified by independent experiments [12] . Fig. 6 shows the test results using a 4L filter with each module/layer having a basis weight of 0.765gsm. The total basis weight for the filter is 3.06 gsm of nanofibers. Both the mechanical capture by diffusion and interception have been raised as compared to 2L with lower fiber basis weight. The U-shape curve for mechanical capture remains evident. The MPPS for mechanical capture is still at 150 nm. The measured efficiency between D p = 50 and 150 nm were 10-20% higher than the prediction given by the dotted curve. This might be related to interaction of aerosols of different sizes that enhanced the capture. For the charged filter, the prediction (solid curve) is 5-8% higher than measurements for aerosol size from 10 to 100 nm, but for larger aerosols better match was obtained until 250 nm. For the 100 nm nano-aerosol, the uncharged 4L nanofiber filter yields efficiency of 60% while the charged nanofiber filter 85%. The added 25% due to electrostatic effect is quite substantial. For the 60 nm aerosol, which corresponds to the minimum size of the COVID-19, the charged 4L PVDF filter yields 80% efficiency which was only 5% lower than that at 100 nm, while the uncharged 4L filter yield 65% efficiency. Of interest is that between 20 and 400 nm, the measured efficiency is between 80 and 90% despite it still maintains a flattened U-shape behavior. It is less than the distinct U-shape as in prediction (depicted by the solid curve), nevertheless it is still present. This indicates diffusion plays a strong role for capturing the nano-aerosols less than 100 nm. Fig. 7 compares the test results for a 6L (total 4.59 gsm) between the uncharged and charged filter. The pressure drop of the filter was 25.8 Pa. The uncharged filter exhibited again a typical U-shape with MPPS at 150 nm with efficiency of 62% efficiency. There was a rough agreement between the prediction with the measurements, which were somewhat scattered. This might be related to the mechanical interaction of aerosols of all sizes before being captured by the fiber by diffusion and interception.",

The ratio of electrostatic efficiency for charged fibers to the mechanical efficiency (diffusion and interception) for uncharged fibers is shown in Fig. 9 . The formulae for the calculations are given in Appendix A. In the figure, four curves are shown corresponding to the 2L, 3L, 4L and 6L, respectively. Each curve has a rapid rise above zero for D p less than 80 nm and increases modestly as D p > 80 nm. For the 2L nanofiber filter, the overall efficiency is not that high, as D p > 80 nm the added electric effect was 1.4-1.8X the mechanical efficiency due to diffusion and interception. On the other hand, for the 6L nanofiber filter where the total efficiency from charged fiber was already > 85%, the efficiency from added electric effect alone was only 1.0-1.4X the mechanical efficiency. Regardless, the aerosols with size > 80 nm receive the most benefit from the added electric effect while aerosol with size less than 80 nm receive lesser benefit. The 80-nm aerosol also corresponds approximately to the minimum size of the COVID-19 virus, which is 60 nm [1] .

Second, the nanofiber basis weight is increased by stack-up in multiples of a single layer/module until the target efficiency is reached. The permeable, electrical-insulator supports for nanofibers in the multilayer filter provide (a) shielding of electrical interference between adjacent layers of charged fibers and on the incoming aerosols, and (b) macropores to the filter easing the flow restriction from the micropores of the nanofibers. Further, the reduced fiber packing density due to use of smaller amounts of fibers in each module reduces the electrical interference and enhances the air permeability of the module.

The setup has been discussed in previous work [11, 13] . The efficiency for 100-nm NaCl aerosol versus pressure drop of the filter is shown in Fig. 14a . It is given by the solid circle. As can be seen, at the same pressure drop and the same basis weight the monodispersed NaCl has higher efficiency than that of the polydispersed ambient aerosols. The difference in the two approaches is larger with less modules and becomes lesser with more modules. Interestingly, the trend of the curve for 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, and 6L is identical between NaCl and ambient aerosols. It is believed that the interaction of aerosol of different size might be the dominant factor among the three factors that cause discrepancy. Despite charge induction on the aerosol takes place at close distance in the proximity of the charged fibers, the aerosols with induced charge dipoles might still interact among themselves before the attraction with the charged nanofibers. Once the number of layers increase, this aerosol-aerosol interaction effect might be reduced as the aerosols have more direct interactions with the charged nanofibers while travelling inside the fiber layers. This can explain the large difference between the NaCl monodispersed aerosol challenge for the 1L (24%) and 2L filters (10%), but as there are more layers in the multilayer filter, this difference is progressively reduced, e.g. 14% for 2L filter and 6% for 6L filter, see Fig. 14a .",

            "text": "1. Ambient aerosols 10-400 nm can be captured with uncharged and charged PVDF nanofiber filter. For the uncharged nanofiber filter, the mechanisms are diffusion and interception. This is characterized by the U-shape behavior with the least efficiency at MPPS of 150 nm. Below 150 nm, diffusion dominates while above 150 nm, interception dominates. The behavior can be predicted using correlation with modification on the diffusion effect at low Peclet number as diffusion is quite strong for nanofiber filter and nanoaerosols under 100 nm. 2. When nanofibers are charged, the dielectrophoresis further help to capture aerosols, this is especially for large aerosols > 80 nm. The characteristics U-shape efficiency versus aerosol size is still present showing diffusion is still important for the nanofiber filter unlike the case for microfibers. In fact, diffusion, interception and dielectrophoresis can all contribute to capture of nano-aerosols independent of each other. For charged filter, the MPPS has been shifted to about 75 nm due to the dielectrophoresis capture. Using simple power law correlation based on \u03b7 o =(aZ) b with Z = C n D p 2 /u for the single fiber efficiency due to dielectrophoresis, the charged nanofiber filter efficiency can be predicted reasonably. 3. Based on the measured efficiency of respectively charged and uncharged filters operating under similar condition, the efficiency due to dielectrophoresis can be determined. The added electrostatic effect is approximately 1.0 to 1.8 times that of the mechanical efficiency (or 50% to 64% of the total filter efficiency) depending the number of layers, 2L to 6L, in the filter. The smaller number of layers, the lower is the total efficiency, the higher is the electrostatic added benefit; and vice versa. This benefit is very prominent for D p > 80 nm. For smaller aerosols, this added benefit drops off substantially because of the small dipole moment associated with the small aerosol size. 4. When the fibers are charged, multilayering is essential to distribute the nanofibers to reduce electrical interference and reduce pressure drop. For the 100 nm aerosol, the efficiency increase from these two effects is almost 40%+ and the quality factor QF is nearly doubled of its initial value, to 0.07 Pa \u22121 ! 5. Multilayering approach has been used to increase the fiber basis weight such that QF, a measure of benefit-to-cost, remains unchanged. This is a very important strategy, otherwise, we may have a high efficiency filter, yet also much higher \u0394p. The QF for the tested filters stayed at a high value of 0.1 -0.13 Pa \u22121 . 6. Limited experiments have also been carried out using monodispersed NaCl aerosols for 50 nm, 100 nm, and 300 nm, respectively. It was found that they behave similarly as that carried out using the polydispersed ambient aerosols when multiple layers were used to build up the amounts of nanofibers in the filter to achieve high efficiency. This proves that the ambient aerosol test results are valid, despite the efficiency is lower as compared to the laboratory monodispersed NaCl aerosols by 2-10% depending on the number of layers in the multilayer filter. This discrepancy is related to adopting ambient aerosol with amorphous shape and more so the complicated interaction of ambient aerosols of different sizes undergoing dielectrophoresis (induction followed by electrostatic attraction). The discrepancy between the two approaches reduces with more layers in the multilayer charged nanofiber filter. This is because the multilayer filter promotes more interaction between the aerosols and the charged fibers via dielectrophoresis and reduces the self-interactions of charged aerosols of different sizes among themselves. 7. A 6-layer (6L) multimodule/multilayer charged nanofiber filter can achieve 88%, 88% and 96% for the ambient aerosol size of 50, 100, and 300 nm. This is close to reaching the goal of 90% for the nanoaerosols at 100 nm. The same filter when tested with the monodispersed NaCl aerosols can achieve 92%, 94%, and 98% for aerosol size of 50, 100, and 300 nm, respectively. In all cases, the pressure drop was 26 Pa for the 6L nanofiber filter which was below the set 30-Pa limit. 8. Despite the test efficiency on the 300-nm ambient aerosol was 96%, the 300 nm NaCl aerosols test on the same filter would have achieved a higher efficiency of 98%. Therefore, the 6L charged nanofiber filter is equivalent to 'N98 respirator standard' but with pressure drop of only 26 Pa (2.5 mm water) which is significantly below that of conventional N95 respirator. (Note, N98 does not exist, only N95, N99, and N100 are being used, but what we have achieved is an equivalence of a N98 requirement of 98% capture on 300-nm aerosol.)",
