In the last hundred years, virus attacks were documented four times: The Spanish flu (H1N1) in 1918, Asian flu (H2N2) in 1957, Hong Kong influenza (H3N2) in 1968 and swine influenza (H1N1) in 2009. It seems obvious to expect an influenza pandemic to return [3,4]. The illness affects groups of all ages, and this pattern is not common for most viruses. There is a high possibility for every human to suffer from influenza. Groups infected are mostly schoolchildren, the elderly and patients with serious medical conditions. Infections of respiratory viruses, mainly influenza, and RSV, occur seasonally in winter months (from December to March) in Europe, what is less common in hot climates where rhinovirus is seen in fall and spring, while adenovirus infects all year [2]. Influenza spreads very easily among the population and shows high attack rates. In the US, it is the 8th highest cause of death, infects around 0.4 to 0.6 billion of children and 0.2 to 5.0 billion adults worldwide [5], kills 0.5 to 1 million people annually with numbers still increasing [6,7].",

            "text": "The influenza virus construction is comparatively simple. It mainly contains 8-segmented RNA and surface proteins with highly immunogenic properties. Distinguishable are three types\u2014influenza A, B, and C, all belonging to the Orthomyxovirus family. The A-type is mostly responsible for pandemics in the 20th\u201321st century. Two glycoproteins cover the viral surface: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) in a ratio of four to one [8]. Based on surface composition, distinguishable are 18 H (H1\u2013H18) and 11 N (N1\u2013N11) subtypes forming potentially 198 combinations [3]. Influenza A infects the human population, birds, pigs, dogs, horses and more [9]. Genetic recombination is possible through the segmented genome. Reassortment of genes is highly important in the epidemics. Human population does not have the immunity against mutants with new HA and NA antigens on the virion surface. There is a possibility of interspecies transmission without genetic reassortment, like in the case of H1N1 virus between swine and humans (and conversely) or H9N2 from poultry to humans. In other cases, RNA segment reassortment occurs if at least two influenza viruses infect a single hosts cell [10,11]. Animal influenza viruses which occasionally infecting humans are called zoonotic influenza viruses (in direct and indirect contact) [12]. This high possibility of genetic variation can have subsequently pandemic effects. Most of the new influenza viruses are mutants forming from antigenic drift [11].",

So there is a possibility of human infection by avian influenza, but less efficiently [18,19]. The next step is neuraminidase activity. Sialic acid is rifted from the cell\u2019s surface, what enables the influenza virus release and distribution in the respiratory tract. The NA protein plays a role in replication of A and B influenza types. The M2 protein is essential after cell entry through uncoating of influenza A virus [13]. Influenza incubation lasts 1 to 4 days, then the virus sheds and symptoms appear. Viruses circulate in a host for 5 to 10 days but decrease 3\u20135 days after the first symptoms [20].",

As a result, surface glycoproteins undergo some variations (minor changes in amino acid sequence like point mutations in genes). The ability of influenza virus to progressive antigenic change forces updates of vaccines composition [21]. Influenza glycoproteins are an excellent target for virus detection due to many copies of HA (around 300) and NA (around 50) on one viral particle [21,22].

Vaccines are updated annually to match current strain trends, as antigenic drift frequently occurs in A and B influenza viruses [24]. However, they provide only moderate protection, especially for children and the elderly. This can be caused by preclinical tests on animals which differ in immunocompetence or immune history compared to humans. Deviations are also dependent on vaccines formulation, which can contain DNA, peptides, recombinant proteins and others. Rowell et al. [25] confirmed the influence of immune history on vaccine protection level. The traditional influenza vaccine was inserted into mice after two pre-vaccinations with different vaccine types. Immune responses were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and interferon-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT). Results showed that traditional vaccine protection was enhanced, unchanged or negatively interfered when prior vaccination was used.",

The greatest treatment benefits can be obtained when medicine is given within the first 24\u201330 h of first infection symptoms [26]. Moreover, antivirals lose their efficacy in 24 to 48 h in cases of people with a weak immune system [27]. Nowadays, significant interest is focused on developing devices able to detect various diseases in an easy and reliable way, within short time and at the early stage of the infection. The main goal is to enhance the efficiency of a treatment [26]. However, it is challenging to design molecular-based diagnosis tests when influenza characterizes with extreme genetic variability. It is important to understand pathogen action in the host organism exactly and precisely follow infection and post-infection reaction mechanisms.",

Thus, false positive and false negative results should be considered, especially during high influenza activity season [29]. False-negatives occur more often than false-positives. Negative results cannot exclude virus infection [31]. Undeniably, this kind of tests contributes to shortening the time of infection diagnosis, especially when the algorithm of influenza detection is long and laboratory procedures and requirements are high [32,33]. RIDTs performance is better in children than adults (around 13% greater) due to higher viral loads and longer viral shedding [34]. Tests differ in the virus type detected and with distinguishing between types, it means detection of only A type, A and B types with or without distinguishing between them [35]. Sensitivity for B-type virus detection is lower than A-type. None of RIDTs can distinguish influenza A subtypes. In some tests, the results standardization is possible due to analyzing devices. They are available in cassette, card and dipstick formats, with a visual inspection or automated readers [36]. RIDTs belong to II class of devices which need general and special controls. They were reclassified by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from I class with low risk due to many failures in the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Also, FDA evaluated some criteria for RIDTs that must be adhered [31].",

            "text": "NGS is one of the most influencing techniques in genetic and medicine fields. NGS compared to the original Sanger sequencing extremely speeds up the analysis due to automation possibilities. The next advantage is decreasing the costs from $100 million for human genome sequencing in 2001, by Sanger method, to $2400 nowadays. Some other technique, Illumina Platform, offers one million bases sequencing for the cost from $0.05 to $0.15 [67,68]. In general, Illumina Platform is basing on the amplification of nucleic acid fragments on solid substrate or bridge amplification. Whitehead et al. [69] applied Illumina NGS platform to create sequence-function map to optimize influenza-binding proteins. This technique has big chances to develop new effective influenza inhibitors. Another Platform, Roche 454 Life Sciences, developed NGS platforms based on pyrosequencing. It has found application in influenza A case for molecular markers identification, gene coding M2 protein mutation identification or Single Nucleotide Polymorphism detection in the gene coding hemagglutinin [54]. Except listed above, there are more NGS Platforms, like Pacific Bioscience, Ion Proton, Complete Genomics and more, which use different sequencing techniques and have both advantages and limitations, vary on costs, read length, analysis time and error rate. For example, the Chembio portable lateral flow platform can be performed outside the laboratory giving results in 25 min. The Luminex analysis requires fewer reagents, offers fewer errors and a wide linear range [55].",

Electrochemical EIS biosensor for PB1-F2 was developed by Miodek et al. [112] The authors used antibody-antigen approach and modified gold electrode with a specific anti-PB1-F2 antibody with three steps. Firstly, pyrrole and ferrocene derivatives were electrochemically polymerized onto the Au surface. The next step was biotin/streptavidin linkage and the closing step was biotinylated antibodies immobilization. For confirmation of proper sensor modification the surface plasmon resonance (SPR), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques were used. By differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) two linear ranges were observed, 50\u2013300 nM and 0.5\u20131.5 mM of PB1-F2 what was probably caused by two specific antibody sites.

The authors have achieved sensitivity higher than ELISA; the detection range was from 2.7 \u00d7 102 to 2.7 \u00d7 103 PFU/mL. Li et al. [141] combined complement fixation and luminol chemiluminescence for rH7N9 detection, which is a recombinant avian influenza virus protein. This assay could be completed in 2.5 h with a linear detection from 0.25 fg/mL to 25 ng/mL. Tran et al. [142] detected influenza A viruses using carbon nanotubes field effect transistor (CNTFET) DNA sensor. The response time was less than 1 min, and the detection range was linear from 1 pM (LOD) to 10 nM. The sensor signal recovery was 97% after 7-month storage in pH-controlled conditions. The most interesting biosensors were compared in Table 2.",
