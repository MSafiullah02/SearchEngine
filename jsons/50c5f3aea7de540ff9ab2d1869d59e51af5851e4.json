This action followed a Healthy Distance Sanitary action on March 23rd, 2020. The aim of both measures was to reduce community transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico by lowering the effective contact rate. Using a modification of the Kermack-McKendrick SEIR model we explore the effect of behavioral changes required to lower community transmission by introducing a time-varying contact rate, and the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to suspension of non-essential activities. Our study shows that there exists a trade-off between the proportion of the population under SEM and the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral changes needed to Manuscript J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof achieve an effective social distancing. This trade-off generates an optimum value for the proportion of the population under strict mitigation measures, significantly below 1 in some cases, that minimizes maximum COVID-19 incidence. We study the population-level impact of three key factors: the implementation of behavior change control measures, the time horizon necessary to reduce the effective contact rate and the proportion of people under SEM in combating COVID-19. Our model is fitted to the available data. The initial phase of the epidemic, from February 17th to March 23rd, 2020, is used",

Note that the surface shows a region for minima corresponding to values of q > 0.5 and for all 1/\u03c9 in the interval [151, 276] days (5 to 9 months approximately).

The voluntary stay-at-home strategy in effect at the time of writing, requires a level of awareness and behavioral change that take time to become established in the population. Behavioral change is one of the main public health control mechanisms for reducing effective contact rates (in the form of so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions[6]). However, when dealing with behavioral issues, we enter into the psychological realm of individuals and groups of individuals. In our simulations we or awareness and rational decisions regarding the behavioral change associated with reducing effective contact rates is the same for asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, although there is some evidence that this might not be the case as one can directly witness in the street of large metropolitan areas like Mexico City. We find that there exists a trade-off between the percentage of the population put into SEM (q) and the the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral requirements of effective social distancing (\u03c9). This trade-off generates and optimum value of q, not necessarily very high, that minimizes maximum incidence. Parameter \u03c9 can be thought of as a \"leak rate\". The reason behind the existence of an optimal rate q that minimizes the maximum COVID-19 incidence is as follows. When q is small, there is a large quantity of individuals outside SEM. Therefore, the net flux of individuals leaking from the population complying with SEM, is relatively small and does not affect the positive effect of q which is to reduce the effective contact rate and therefore the incidence. However, as more people adhere to SEM protocols, the net flux of leaked individuals becomes more important until we reach a point where the negative effect of abandoning safe social-distancing and behavioral practices counter-balances the beneficial effect of SEM. Recall that, in our model, the population outside SEM has a higher effective contact rate even though they also reduce it when the government indicative is announced. On the other hand we assume that before March 23rd, 2020, the epidemic follows the standard Kermack-McKendrick model and therefore both contact rates (for asymptomatically and symptomatically infected individuals) are constant. After March 23rd, 2020, social-distancing measures are implemented with the aim of reducing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof these two original contact rates. We model this by assuming that there is 1) a target effective contact rate reduction (modeled by the proportions \u03b1 i for each subpopulation), and 2) a time during which awareness develops implying a paulatine but decreasing contact rate over time. Since reducing the effective contact rate is a demand on a behavioral trait, we assume it is not automatic, that it takes time. Our model does not account for the conditions and actions associated with lifting SEM. Therefore, in the model, the reduction when achieved, remains in place for a long period of time. Under this conditions, assuming that the educational/promotional efforts of the government to enforce the non-pharmaceutical interventions are effective for at least 6 months after the implementation of SEM (1/\u03c9 = 200 days), we show that the scenario with the optimal q = 0.7, when maximum incidence is minimized (Figure A.10), coincides with the projection of having maximum incidence in middle to late May, 2020 made by the Secretary of Health [16]. However, our model shows that the incidence peak date is rather sensitive to changes in the values of q and \u03c9. In summary our model is looking only at the scenario where SEM is maintained. Our model exploration finishes in late August. It is expected that (a gradual) lifting of SEM restrictions will start on the first week of June. However, this fact may change in the following weeks since incidence and deaths are increasing quickly at present.Mathematical models are important tools to assess and evaluate mitigation objectives as minimizing morbidity and mortality, diminishing an epidemic peak that otherwise could saturate health-care services, soften the impact on the economy, give time for vaccine development and manufacture Appendix A.
