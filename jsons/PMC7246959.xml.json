For example, before COVID-19, HIV testing uptake was already lower in rural and impoverished regions of the country, and among men [9]. Distance to biomedical clinics has also been shown to decrease HIV service utilization in rural Uganda [10, 11]. Like much of sub-Saharan Africa, our study region is medically pluralistic, where people seek care from both formal and informal healthcare resources. We have previously described preference for traditional healing, sometimes rooted in mistrust of biomedicine [12]. The qualitative data presented here illustrate how COVID-19 is inhibiting access to and uptake of HIV testing services among rural Ugandans by underscoring existing structural barriers (lack of transportation, poverty, location of biomedical resources), and through the influence of new, stigmatizing beliefs surrounding COVID-19.",

However, findings from our study can inform effective and adaptive solutions to mitigate the deleterious impacts of COVID-19 in HIV endemic regions [17]. Strategies to decentralize HIV testing services among rural communities could mitigate the barriers we describe above. While mobile outreach services have had success in the past [18], these initiatives require significant investment and infrastructure, and may be difficult to implement in the setting of COVID-related social distancing protocols.",

While maintaining a safe distance, healers could be available to supervise clients\u2019 self-testing, aid with interpreting testing results, offer counseling and support following test results, encourage linkage to care for those testing positive, and distribute kits to those wishing to test at home. Finally, we suggest that COVID-stigma reduction initiatives will be critically important to combat growing fear and mistrust of biomedicine among rural populations. Addressing stigma and discrimination towards people recovering from COVID-19, and towards healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients, within these communities should be a priority component of COVID-recovery efforts.",
