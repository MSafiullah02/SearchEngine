Therefore, ADE would limit any further harm to the microbiome, inflicted by broad-spectrum agents and would thus allow for a broad-spectrum empirical safety net as well as for the application of antimicrobial stewardship principles.

However, this assumption has given us an unwarranted sense of safety that ADE would prevent the ecological consequences of extremely broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial treatment regimens. These regimens are often considered lifesaving and necessary in patients with severe infections especially in the setting of high prevalence of AMR. Recent research, however, has clearly shown that AMR appears earlier than expected in the course of treatment, probably within the first few days [11]. Thus, ADE should not be used as an excuse for the indiscriminate prescription of broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimens.",

First, although none of the involved studies was designed to assess its effect on total duration of therapy, ADE has been associated with an increase in the total duration of antimicrobial therapy [1]. There may be multiple possible explanations for this finding, including potential \u201cerrors in counting total days of therapy\u201d and the perception that narrow-spectrum antimicrobials are harmless and can be continued for longer periods of time [12]. Second, the risk of using ADE as an excuse to continue antimicrobials in the absence of infection is likely to cause more harm than stopping all antimicrobials alltogether. On one hand, narrower agents will still cause the emergence of AMR, and on the other, continuing antimicrobials in the absence of infection may decrease the quality of diagnostic decision-making [13]. Finally, the broad- and narrower spectrum antimicrobials may differ in their pharmacokinetics resulting in insufficient concentrations at the site of infection and PK/PD target attainment, often with a disadvantage for narrow-spectrum antibiotics [14].",

Similar findings were reported in a randomised clinical trial comparing ADE and continuation of the pivotal antimicrobial [7].

However, \u201cgrading\u201d of antimicrobials according to spectrum is not an easy task. A French group proposed a six-rank consensual classification of beta-lactam antibiotics. Despite several Delphi rounds, no consensus was reached to differentiate piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, fourth-generation cephalosporin and antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin. The group could not find an agreement on the delay within which ADE should be performed and on whether or not the shortening of antimicrobial therapy duration should be included in ADE definition [17]. In parallel, a group of experts from the US developed a numerical score to measure the spectrum of antimicrobial regimens [18]. The classification that was obtained using a Delphi consensus procedure based on clinical scenario\u2019s differed from the one reported by the French group. Piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was the worst ecological antimicrobial for the US group, whereas imipenem was selected by the French group.

Short exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials already results in early disruption of intestinal microbiome [19]. It has been demonstrated that as little as 1 day of exposure to imipenem is enough to result in AMR [11]. For each day of additional exposure to cefepime or piperacillin/tazobactam, the risk of MDR emergence increases with 8% [20]. Furthermore, antibiotics have been found to persist for up to 48 h at low concentrations after discontinuation [21] and these low concentrations are at high risk for the emergence of resistance.",

A crucial necessity is to obtain cultures from relevant sites before antibiotics are administered, as the absence of cultures or negative cultures has been associated with non-ADE [1]. The challenge and complexity of this process in routine practice are often underestimated in recommendations and guidelines. First, all samples are not equal: samples obtained from sterile sites have a different role compared to samples obtained from superficial sites: e.g. positive blood cultures are more relevant than samples collected from skin wound or through a drain. In this context, respiratory samples are the most challenging to interpret in the absence of quantitative cultures or other diagnostic approaches that allow discrimination between infection and colonisation. Clearly, defining ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as hospital-acquired pneumonia remains difficult and may be an obstacle to ADE. Second, infective pathogens should be discriminated from colonising pathogens, in the absence of accurate biomarkers. Third, all pathogens are not equal: identification of S. aureus is more significant than that of coagulase-negative Staphylococci, although this should be modulated by the clinical context. In brief, there are some situations in which the confidence in a sample and its clinical relevance are higher compared to some other situations.

Indeed, in patients who are improving, e.g. in whom the SOFA score decreased during the first 48\u201372 h, the need for continuing treatment beyond day 3 should be debated for a significant number of infections. A seminal randomised clinical trial suggested that, in patients with non-severe pulmonary infiltrate, a course of 3 days of ciprofloxacin was as efficient as a prolonged treatment [40]. The feasibility of ultra-short course of antimicrobial treatments has been suggested in an observational study comparing 259 patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia treated for 1\u20133 days and 1031 treated for > 3 days, the outcomes of two groups being similar [41]. For longer courses of antimicrobial therapy (7 days or more), ADE should probably be a recommended strategy, particularly if high-quality and clinically relevant samples are available. Its presumed effects on AMR and cost are relevant in these conditions. For intermediate-duration antimicrobial therapy (5\u20137 days), decisions should be tailored according to institutional ASP recommendations.",
