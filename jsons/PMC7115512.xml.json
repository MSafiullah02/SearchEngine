Thus, the prospects of a firm are closely tied to the state of the economy (or economic climate). In other words, changes in corporate performance are closely related to expansion and contraction of the business cycle. Bodie et al. (2008) argued that the economic climate might have a greater impact on profits than the firm's performance within its industry. The corporate performance in the hotel industry may also rely on economic conditions.",

            "text": "The hotel industry is viewed as a cyclical industry, an industry that is highly sensitive to the state of the economy (Bodie et al., 2008). The reason is that the hotel companies tend to have higher fixed costs (costs that all firms incur regardless of their production levels) than variable costs (costs that increase or decrease as the firm produces more or less). With high fixed costs, hotel companies are very sensitive to business conditions because in economic downturns, hotel firms cannot reduce costs as output falls in response to falling sales. Hotel profits will hence swing more widely with sales because costs do not move to offset revenue variability (i.e. small swings in business conditions can have profound effects on profitability of hotels). As Graham and Harris (1999) noted, due to their high fixed costs, hotels require maintaining high revenue to survive and generate adequate profit.",

On the one hand, the expansion of tourism industry or activities directly enhances the development of hotel industry by increasing the occupancy rate and hence sales revenue. On the other hand, tourism development can significantly improve business environment, which has an indirect effect on the corporate performance of hotel firms. Previous empirical studies have supported that tourism expansion can boost economic development (Balaguer and Cantavella-Jorda, 2002, Dritsakis, 2004, Fayissa et al., 2008, Gunduz and Hatemi-J, 2005, Kim et al., 2006, Lee and Chang, 2008, Proenca and Soukiazis, 2008). Chen (2007b) showed that improved economic conditions caused by tourism expansion could raise corporate earnings and strengthen the financial performance of tourism-related firms. In other words, the expansion of tourism is expected to promote the corporate performance of hotel companies.",

To measure corporate performance, the majority of previous studies used return on assets/return on equity (Athanasoglou, Brissimis, & Delis, 2008) or stock returns (Barro, 1990, Beckers et al., 1992, Chen, 2007b, Chen et al., 2005, Fama and French, 1988). Ross, Westerfield, and Jordan (2008) stated that return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) indicate the profitability of companies, which may fail to measure the company's overall performance. Moreover, although stock price has been widely used as an indicator for corporate performance (Chen, 2007b, Heiman, 1988), it might be easily twisted by expectations of irrational investors about future corporate earnings. That is, if investors are not rational, investors' perceptions about market riskiness will be biased and a firm's stock price would not reflect the true financial performance.",

            "text": "Specifically, this study makes the following contributions to the tourism literature. First, various indicators of corporate performance are used to test the effects of economic condition and tourism growth on corporate performance in the tourist hotel industry. The indicators of corporate performance under consideration are occupancy rate, ROA, ROE, stock return, and a comprehensive score. The occupancy rate is a common performance measure of sales revenue in the hotel industry. As mentioned, ROA and ROE measure profitability of hotel companies, whereas stock price can evaluate hotel stock performance. In addition, we follow Boubakri et al., 2005, Kesner, 1987, Liu and Hung, 2006 and Otchere and Chan (2003) to use several accounting/financial ratios to calculate a comprehensive measure, or score, of corporate performance that can represent the overall financial performance of hotel companies. Six accounting ratios, including debt-equity ratio, total asset turnover, current ratio, quick ratio, ROA, and ROE, are used to calculate a comprehensive score based on factor analysis. The comprehensive score thus combines measures of asset management (total asset turnover), profitability (ROA and ROE), short-term solvency or liquidity (current ratio and quick ratio) and long-term solvency (debt-equity ratio). In consequence, this study enables us to evaluate the impact of economic condition and tourism expansion on the corporate performance of tourist hotels in terms of not only their sales revenue, profitability and stock performance but also the overall financial performance. Empirical findings can provide tourism policymakers and hotel business managers with some practical managerial implications.",

The accounting ratios selected in the study need to meet two criteria. The accounting ratios have to have complete data from the second quarter of 1997 to the first quarter of 2008. Moreover, the selected accounting variables can represent six dimensions of corporate performance: capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risks (Persons, 1999, Thomson, 1991). Accordingly, six accounting ratios are selected in the study: debt-equity ratio, total asset turnover, current ratio, return on assets, return on equity and quick ratio. The quarterly data of six financial ratios are also obtained from the TEJ database.",

The economic factor is changes in the economy (real GDP growth rate, \u0394GDP), whereas tourism expansion (the growth rate of foreign tourist arrivals, \u0394TA) is used as the industry-specific factor. The indicators of corporate performance of hotels under consideration include occupancy rate (OPR), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), stock return and a comprehensive score. OPR is a common performance measure of sales revenue in the hotel industry. ROA and ROE measure the profitability of hotel companies, whereas stock return can evaluate hotel stock performance. Based on factor analysis approach, six accounting ratios (total asset turnover, return on assets, return on equity, current ratio, quick ratio and debt-equity ratio) are used to compute a comprehensive score that can measure the overall financial performance rather than just sales revenue, profitability and stock performance. The comprehensive score combines measures of asset management (total asset turnover), profitability (ROA and ROE), short-term solvency or liquidity (current ratio and quick ratio) and long-term solvency (debt-equity ratio). The effects of \u0394GDP and \u0394TA on corporate performance in the tourist hotel industry are then scrutinized via panel regression tests.",

The results imply that tourist hotels can enjoy a better occupancy rate when the economy is expanding and the foreign tourist market is growing. In contrast, the hotel occupancy will suffer if the economy is in recession and tourism interest in Taiwan is low. Compared to the economic factor, the industry factor explains more variation in occupancy rate. Changes in the state of economy can account for 45% of variation in occupancy rate, whereas tourism expansion describes even as high as 53% of variation in occupancy rate. In other words, the sales revenue of tourist hotels relies heavily on the development of foreign tourist markets and economic conditions.

Note that variations in stock prices, according to the basic stock valuation model, reflect changes in both expected cash flows and the discount factor (perceived riskiness of a stock's cash flows). While the booming economy and especially strong tourism expansion can impact hotel stock prices majorly through their influences on sales revenue of tourist hotels as illustrated above, investors' changing perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows can lead to changes in the discount rate (or the time-varying discount rate). Hence, the time-varying discount rate, caused by investors' changing perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows, can break the tie between hotel stock returns and the two factors, regardless of how good the state of economy and how successful tourism development can be in improving earnings performance.",

The 911 terrorist attacks in the US seriously damaged the occupancy rate, stock performance and performance. In comparison, the 921 earthquake only hurt the hotel stock returns.

Thus the event had no significant effect on occupancy rate, profitability and performance. Second, the 921 earthquake was considered as a local crisis, one that did not seriously damage the foreign tourism market. This is supported by the statistics. The growth rate of foreign tourist arrivals was \u22125.21% in the third quarter of 1999 (when the 921 earthquake struck), which is relatively small compared to \u22129.87% and \u2212129.05% for the corresponding quarter of the 911 terrorist attacks in the US and the SARS outbreak. Since the growth rate of foreign tourist arrivals has a substantial influence on corporate performance of tourist hotels, it explains why the damage of the 921 earthquake and the SARS outbreak is the least and the most serious, respectively.",

In other words, large tourist hotels generate better sales, but worse corporate performance in terms of profitability. The poor profitability and the corporate performance of tourist hotels may be attributed to the following reasons. Net profit is equal to total revenues minus total cost. Large tourist hotels enjoy high occupancy and hence sales revenue, but low profitability. Apparently, they need to focus on the issue of cost control.",

Taiwan and China signed the agreement to restore regular direct flights between the two regions on June 13, 2008 and direct flights resumed on July 4, 2008. Currently, up to 3000 Chinese tourists a day are allowed to visit Taiwan and the number may increase from 3000 to 7200 after May 2009. This phenomenon of tourism growth is expected to improve the Taiwanese economy and the corporate performance of local hotel companies. For example, it is estimated that 3000 Chinese visitors per day would bring at least 60 billion Taiwanese dollars (US $2.7 billion) a year for local restaurants, hotels, bus companies and tour agents and moreover, approximately 30,000 jobs could be created, reducing domestic unemployment rate by one percent (AsiaOne, 2008).",
