Xiao et al[4] reported the isolation and characterization of a 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus from pangolins (Manis javanica). Similarly, in October 2019, a viral metagenomic study of pangolins identified severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-related sequences,[5] which can be re-identified as 2019-nCoV-related sequences.[6] Moreover, we also reported the isolation and identification of 2019-nCoV-related coronaviruses in pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China.[7] Altogether, pangolins are likely a reservoir or an intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.[5]",

Without prior experience of therapy, the current treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is mainly empirical and symptomatic, and a limited number of therapeutics in ongoing clinical trial were adopted from previous research on SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which are only remotely related with 2019-nCoV. With low or no pathogenicity in humans and close genetic relationship with 2019-nCoV, our pangolin coronavirus provides an ideal alternative model for 2019-nCoV research. Our reasoning of this isolate having low or no pathogenicity in humans was based on the fact that, back in 2017, no suspected infections were found in those having close contacts with pangolins; and our pangolin coronavirus isolate was routinely cultured in biosafety level 2 facilities. Here we present a screening of clinically approved drugs for anti-coronavirus activity in this 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model, and identify the potent inhibitors for pangolin coronavirus infection.",

In Vero E6 cells treated with 0.8, 4, and 20 nmol/L concentrations of ACE2-targeting siRNAs, the yields of ACE2 mRNA and viral RNA were all significantly reduced, suggesting that ACE2 expression was knocked down by siRNA [Figure 1B] and ACE2 was also a receptor of 2019-nCoVr GX_P2V [Figure 1C]. It appears that ACE2 is a conserved receptor of both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV-related viruses. It is noted, however, that having a possible receptor of ACE2 does not correlate to viral pathogenicity. In fact, no human infection relating to our pangolin CoV was identified or suspected, suggesting that CoV GX_P2V is nonpathogenic in humans. Altogether, the close relationship to 2019-nCoV, the shared receptor and non-pathogenicity, support that pangolin CoV GX_P2V can be used as an accessible in vitro model for developing therapies against 2019-nCoV.",

Infected cells without any drug treatment showed typical CPE-cell rounding with no obvious lysis. Importantly, three drugs, CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of CPE in infected cells [Supplementary Figure 1]. The viral RNA level in the infected cells treated with 10 \u03bcmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than that in infected cells without drug treatment (1.00 \u00b1 0.12 vs. [6.48 \u00b1 0.02] \u00d7 10\u22124, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) [Figure 2B].

We next investigated this drug's anti-viral mechanism by conducting viral entry, post-entry, and full-time assays in 12 well plates [Figure 3B]. In the viral entry assay, cells were incubated with media containing both viruses and CEP during the first 2 h of infection, then were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were supplemented with media containing no drugs. In the viral post-entry assay, cells were incubated in media containing no CEP during the first 2 h of infection, then were supplemented with media containing CEP. In the viral full-time assay, cells were constantly incubated in media containing CEP. Viral RNA yields were determined by qRT-PCR at 48 h p.i. Compared to normal infections without drug treatment, the viral RNA yields in the entry, post-entry and full-time assays were 2.17-fold (0.46 \u00b1 0.12 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.37, t = 2.42, P < 0.01), 1618-fold (6.18 \u00b1 0.95 vs. [1.00 \u00b1 0.43] \u00d7 10\u22124, t = 3.98, P <0.001), and 12,459-fold (4.58 \u00b1 1.27 vs. [1.00 \u00b1 0.43] \u00d7 10\u22125, t = 4.03, P < 0.001) lower, respectively. Further plaque assays found no production of live viruses in the media containing 10 \u03bcmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. [Figure 3C].
