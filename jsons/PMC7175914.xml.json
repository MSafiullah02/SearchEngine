Moreover, according to the present COVID-19 variations and control strategies, the Guangdong province adjusted the emergency response level of epidemic prevention and control from the first level response to the second level at Feb 24, 2020 (http://www.gd.gov.cn/). More and more workers will come back to Guangdong province from other provinces. Thereby, we choose Guangdong province as a case study to explore the effects of the population migration and quarantine strategies on the COVID-19 variations. Based on the present rigorous and extreme control measures in Hubei province, input population from Hubei province are not considered.",

Very small estimations are obtained with the AE values of \u22125.33, \u22122.63 and \u22123.38 for the cumulative cases, confirmed cases and recovered cases. The comprehensive accuracies of our model are quantitatively measured by the DISO with the values of 0.06, 0.11 and 0.17 for the cumulative cases, confirmed cases and recovered cases. For the validation at Feb 20, Feb 21, Feb 22 and Feb 23, 2020, the very small RE values of the cumulative confirmed cases, confirmed cases and recovered cases indicate that our model also has very high accuracies and it can be employed to predict the future variations of the COVID-19 disease (Table 2).",
