The sample includes all such cases collected at any VA posttraumatic stress disorder Clinical Teams across the United States between January 1, 2008 and May 31, 2015 using the MMPI-2 or MMPI-2-RF (via the VA Mental Health Assistant suite). Associations between gender and score differences were also examined. In contrast to past research using the MMPI-2, results of this study suggest that veterans are generally homogeneous in their MMPI-2-RF profiles across different periods of service. Specifically, the magnitudes of mean differences are small and not clinically significant. Thus, responses on the MMPI-2-RF do not appear influenced by service era. Implications for the clinical use of, and research with, the MMPI-2-RF are discussed within the VA healthcare system.",

            "text": "The Veteran Health Administration (VHA) provides medical and psychological care for a large portion of the country's veterans. There are approximately 18.5 million veterans presently in the United States and about 21% have mental or physical health conditions resulting from, or exasperated by, their military service (United States Census Bureau, 2017) . Accordingly, those who are service connected frequently receive compensation for multiple conditions, including both physical and mental health diagnoses (Veterans Benefit Administration, 2017) and a variety of services options exist within the Veteran Affairs (VA) system to address veteran healthcare concerns (e.g., routine and emergency medical care, home-based primary care, domiciliary support, community living centers, and behavioral health). Moreover, mental health problems frequently exist in addition to the physical health concerns veterans experience (Selim et al., 2004) . Indeed, of the 4.5 million veterans screened in primary care settings, approximately a quarter, or 1.15 million, were diagnosed with at least one of five common mental health concerns (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] , substance use disorder, anxiety, and serious mental illness; Trivedi et al., 2015) . Psychologists play an increasingly important role in the VA as there is an ongoing effort to implement integrated mental health interventions (Zeiss & Karlin, 2008) . Thus, provision of services within the VA medical system that is sensitive to both medical and psychological concerns is vital to meeting the healthcare needs of veterans.",

Efforts to evaluate and understand veteran experience, and subsequently presentation of healthcare concerns, require consideration of an array of distinct service experiences (Armistead-Jehle, Soble, Cooper, & Belanger, 2017; Coll & Weiss, 2016) . The era during which a veteran served in the military, and the associated country or region in which they were deployed, is a common descriptive characteristic for contextualizing an individual's military service history. For instance, compensation for injuries are categorized by periods of eligible service (Department of Veteran Affairs, 2018) . Bumper stickers, descriptive apparel, self-affirming statements (e.g., \"I am a Vietnam Vet\"), and other expressive methods are often used to express the time and deployment locations occurring within their service record. Moreover, research frequently examines differences between service eras (e.g., Mclaughlin, Nielsen, & Waller, 2008; Teigen, 2006; Wilmoth, London, & Parker, 2010) or provides information on service era as a critical sample descriptive characteristic (e.g., Bellet, McDevitt-Murphy, Thomas, & Luciano, 2018; Ingram, Tarescavage, Ben-Porath, & Oehlert, 2019a, b; Mozley, Willer, Weathers, Beckham, & Feldman, 2005) .",

These groups report a variety of substantially different wartime, homecoming, and medical experiences. They tend to not only seek treatment at different rates and in different ways (Boyd, Juanamarga, & Hashemi, 2015; Quatana et al., 2014) , but also present with distinct sets of medical and diagnostic concerns stemming from actual or perceived wartime conditions (e.g., varying rates of exposure to blast concussive force, Gulf War Syndrome, and Agent Orange Exposure; Haley, Kurt, & Hom, 1997; Stellman & Stellman, 2018; Wells et al., 2011) . Vietnam veterans report experiencing social rejection and feelings of betrayal lasting for over 30 years following their service (Desai, Pavlo, Harpaz-Rotem, & Rosenheck, 2016) . They are also more likely to apply for social security disability than Gulf War Veterans (Muller, Early, & Ronca, 2014) . Additionally, there are demographic differences between the groups, with Vietnam era veterans being more likely to have been married, less likely to be female, less likely to be working, and more likely to have a history of incarceration Maclean & Elder, 2007) .",

            "text": "In addition to those concerns outlined above, a number of studies have interpreted their findings in such a way as to suggest that psychiatric issues also vary across service era. Exemplifying this, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common psychiatric issue for those with military service histories and impacts veterans in a manner that is disproportionate to the civilian population (Kilpatrick et al., 2013) . Estimates suggest that between 13 and 14% of veterans qualify for a PTSD diagnosis (e.g., Tanielian & Jaycox, 2008) and an approximate 17% of the veterans receive disability compensation from the VA solely because of PTSD (National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics, 2014) . Due to both its impact and frequency within this population, PTSD is a public health epidemic for veterans (Dursa, Reinhard, Barth, & Schneiderman, 2014) . PTSD substantially impacts physical and mental well-being (Kyle, Wade, Andersen, & Ouimette, 2010; Maguen et al., 2010) , as well as social and family relationships (Galovski & Lyons, 2004) . Indeed, there is a substantive literature base documenting the relationship between negative health outcomes and PTSD. Chronic pain is a particularly common health concern which is associated with greater prevalence of PTSD (Fishbain, Pulikal, Lewis, & Gao, 2017; Outcat, Hoen, Yu, Franks, & Krebs, 2016) , as a significant portion of those with chronic pain concerns report a history of trauma exposure (\u00c5kerblom, Perrin, Fischer, & McCracken, 2017) . More broadly, those exposed to trauma, as well as those meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD, are more likely to experience various physical health issues such as sleep disorders, respiratory problems, and migraines (El-Gabalawy, Blaney, Tsai, Sumner, & Pietrzak, 2018) . Moreover, health problems seen within those with PTSD include a broad array of issues relating to gastrointestinal, radiological, musculoskeletal, and general health concerns (Pacella, Hruska, & Delahanty, 2013) .",

Of those eras which predominate current VA service utilization (Department of Veteran Affairs, 2018), Vietnam era veterans have had notably higher prevalence rates than those from Gulf War deployments (Fulton et al., 2014; Kang, Natelson, Mahan, Lee, & Murphy, 2003; Murphy, Johnson, Chung, & Beaton, 2003; Weiss et al., 1994) . Likewise, PTSD symptom severity has also been found to differ by service era, albeit with somewhat mixed results (e.g., Gros, Stachan, et al., 2011; Yoder et al., 2012) . To some extent, discrepancies in symptom severity, differences in diagnostic patterns, prevalence across service eras may be a result of differences in the reliability and/or validity of the methods used to assess them (Brown, Grubaugh, Knapp, & Acierno, 2016) . In addition to symptom checklists and diagnostic interviews, which are subject to interviewer or evaluator bias, broadband measures with protocol validity scales are also used to evaluate PTSD. These are objective instruments that can be used to assess the array of clinical concerns central to PTSD (i.e., avoidance behaviors, intrusive symptoms, negative mood and cognitions, and alterations in arousal and reactivity; Sellbom, Lee, Ben-Porath, Arbisi, & Gervais, 2012) . They also evaluate common comorbid concerns which have important clinical implications (e.g., 1 3 anger, aggression, depression, suicidality, hopelessness, substance use; Crowson, Frueh, & Snyder, 2001; Jakupcak, Conybeare, Phelps, Hunt, & Holmes, 2007; Trivedi et al., 2015) . Importantly, broadband measures often have validity scales to evaluate the extent to which the test-taker provided an accurate report of their symptoms.",

After excluding approximately 45% of the initial sample because these individuals produced elevated MMPI-2 Validity Scale scores, Glenn et al. (2002) found that Gulf War veterans endorsed higher rates of hypomania, whereas Vietnam veterans reported greater rates of depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Those of different service eras also reported different rates of two-point code types, which are sometimes interpreted as representative of unique clinical presentations; Vietnam era veterans were more frequently classified as displaying 2-8/8-2 while Gulf veterans more frequently had a 1-8/8-1 profile. In addition, they also found that health-related concerns were higher in Vietnam veterans, including those related to current health concerns as well as physician diagnosed health problems.",

(2002) study (i.e., use of a broadband measure with validity scales), the psychometrics of MMPI-2 scale have long been called into question (e.g., Helmes & Reddon, 1993) . Some of these issues led to the development of the MMPI-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF; Tellegen & Ben-Porath, 2008 , which also has validity scales and substantive scales with notably improved discriminant validity (Ben-Porath, 2012; Simms, Casillas, Clark, Watson, & Doebbeling, 2005) . To date, research on the MMPI-2-RF has established a notable base of literature supporting it as a useful diagnostic aide with veterans in a variety of healthcare settings within the VA. Exemplifying some of this literature, several core scales have demonstrated marked differences for those veterans with PTSD, including Demoralization (RCd), Somatic Concerns (RC1), Low Positive Emotions (RC2), and Dysfunctional Negative Emotions (RC7), all of which are consistently higher among veterans meeting diagnostic criteria (Wolf et al., 2008) . In addition, the Anxiety (AXY) scale has been identified as a key indicator of PTSD symptomatology (e.g., Arbisi et al., 2011; Sellbom et al., 2012) . Beyond use as an aid for assessing PTSD, the MMPI-2-RF substantive scales also predict a variety of clinically relevant criteria across other VA treatment settings, including substance use treatment programs (Forbey & Ben-Porath, 2007) , inpatient and outpatient mental health settings (Nelson, Anderson, Hoelzle, & Arbisi, 2014) , and primary care (Forbey, Ben-Porath, & Arbisi, 2012; Ingram et al., 2019a) .",

Past research demonstrates several differences across veterans from different service eras, including physical and mental health symptom severity, although research using well-validated, broadband measures with protocol validity scales is lacking. Research using the MMPI-2 has found distinct sets of presentation concerns for those evaluated for PTSD that necessitated specific evaluation and treatment needs for not only PTSD, but also related physical health conditions. However, no similar investigations have occurred using the MMPI-2-RF, despite research supporting the improved psychometrics of its scales as well as its utility in assessing veteran relevant health constructs. Therefore, this study utilizes the psychometrically sound MMPI-2-RF to examine differences in symptomatology across the Vietnam and Gulf War service eras in a national sample of VA outpatients.",

Earlier research found service era differences for veterans evaluated on the MMPI-2 that suggested different interpretive and treatment needs within the VA healthcare system (Glenn et al., 2002) . Results from this study suggest four trends that are relevant for the use of, and research with, the MMPI-2-RF: (a) veterans assessed are generally homogeneous in their report of average symptom severity across service eras as significant scale differences are uncommon, (b) the magnitude of effect is small in instances where mean differences emerge, (c) patterns of symptom differences between eras on the MMPI-2-RF differ from the MMPI-2 and most differences reflect non-PTSD diagnostic concerns (i.e., somatic/cognitive complaints), and (d) service era differences are more identifiable when the frequency of clinical elevations (T \u2265 65/T \u2265 75) is compared. Substantive scale means are generally similar across service eras; however, there are more differences in elevation frequencies which are statistically significant. These differences in elevation frequency are most observable on the Specific Problems (i.e., somatic/cognitive, internalizing, externalizing, and interpersonal) and PSY-5 Scales, rather than the Higher-Order and Restructured Clinical Scales. These differences were particularly pronounced for scales assessing constructs relevant to behavioral health settings, and those associated with trauma exposure. Vietnam veterans endorse Gastrointestinal Complaints (GIC) and Head Pain Complaints (HPC) less frequently; however, Neurological Complaints (NUC) are more common. A greater frequency of elevated NUC scores is consistent with an aging population that is more likely to experience neurological concerns, including problems with balance, motor coordination, and increased sensory problems. Those who served during the Gulf War had higher AXY and DISC-r, consistent with a more disinhibited and externalizing presentation. Such a presentation may partially reflect a developmental trajectory, especially for DISC-r, which captures elements of impulsivity that is higher among younger populations. Those scales also reflect a more severe exposure to trauma as many relate to core PTSD criteria (AXY; Sellbom, Lee, Ben-Porath, Arbisi, & Gervais, 2012) and the course of symptom presentation (DISC-r; Sadeh, Miller, Wolf, & Harkness, 2015) .",

While research documents a consistent relationship between PTSD and physical health concerns (\u00c5kerblom et al., 2017; Pacella et al., 2013) , substantial health-related differences do not emerge as a function of service era. Accordingly, this may be understood within the framework that the health issues common to those being evaluated for PTSD are a general response to disorder arousal symptoms (El-Gabalawy et al., 2018) and do not stem from specific service era or deployment experiences (e.g., rates of concussive force exposure, Agent Orange, or Gulf War Syndrome). This has direct clinical implications because the current MMPI-2-RF VA comparison groups do not include Gulf War veterans but can, nonetheless, be used with individuals of this service era. An ability to generalize findings across service eras is critical to improving assessment veracity, and subsequent treatment recommendations, as the MMPI-2-RF is widely used within the VA in a variety of healthcare services and clinic types (e.g., Ingram et al., 2019a; Russo, 2017) .",

Alternatively, past research indicates that SUI scores are increased by the presence of potentially life-threatening medical problems (Tarescavage e al., 2013) , which may explain why SUI elevations were more common among the older Vietnam veteran population. Nevertheless, clinicians should continue being mindful of the potential for suicidal risk-particularly within aging veterans. More generally, primary care settings appear to provide an optimal service location in which to regularly conduct those suicide screenings within the VA healthcare setting (Ashrafioun et al., 2016; Oslin et al., 2006) and the MMPI-2-RF has documented utility within various medical settings (Forbey et al., 2012; Ingram et al., 2019a) , including for spinal surgery and bariatric evaluations (e.g., Block, Ben-Porath, & Marek, 2013; Marek et al., 2012) .",

As noted earlier, Glenn et al. (2002) examined MMPI-2 scores and found that Gulf War veterans endorsed higher rates of hypomania, whereas Vietnam veterans reported greater rates of depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Conversely, in this study there were no meaningful differences in these areas across service eras. These differences may reflect the improved discriminant validity of the MMPI-2-RF scales. Additionally, whereas Glenn and colleagues' investigation of the MMPI-2 utilized a single over-reporting scale to exclude invalid protocols, we utilized all nine MMPI-2-RF Validity Scales. As such, substantive score comparisons in this study are much less influenced by response bias differences across service eras.",

First, although a very high percentage of individuals in PCT teams meet criteria for PTSD (approximately 90%; see Glenn et al., 2002; Mozley et al., 2005) , the individuals assessed as part of this study were not screened for PTSD or other psychiatric diagnoses. Accordingly, it is possible that, to a small extent, scores comparisons vary across groups as a function of their diagnostic presentation. Additionally, veteran age, as well as additional deployment information (other than service era), was not available, which would have been beneficial in identifying service-related experiences and how they may mediate symptom presentation. Finally, only selfreport information was available for the current study. It would have been useful to further compare differences in symptom presentation on the MMPI-2-RF as well as clinician-rated structured interviews. Notwithstanding these limitations, this study's 7-year national sample provides a comprehensive evaluation of service-era differences and offers supplemental understanding about what considerations are important during assessments within the VA healthcare system.",
