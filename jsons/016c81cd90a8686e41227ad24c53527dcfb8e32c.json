This virus causes enteric disease in piglets that is characterized by enteritis and diarrhoea. In our present investigation, 189 diarrhoeic samples were collected between July 2016 and May 2017 from Tibetan pigs inhabiting in three different provinces surrounding the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. We then applied the molecular-based method of reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) to detect the presence of PDCoV in collected samples, and RT-PCR indicated that the prevalence of PDCoV was 3.70% (7/189) in Tibetan pigs. Four of 7 PDCoV-positive pigs were monoinfections of PDCoV, three samples were co-infections of PDCoV with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), and 52 (27.51%) samples were positive for PEDV.

The prevalence of PDCoV in Tibetan pigs was relatively low (3.70%), and only piglets were affected. Our findings are inconsistent with those of other studies, in which 21.8% of pigs in Southern China and 6.51% of pigs in mainland China have been reported to be infected with PDCoV (Dong et al., 2015; Song", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "E F E R E N C E S Dong, N., Fang, L., Zeng, S., Sun, Q., Chen, H., & Xiao, S.

Prevalence of diarrhoeal disease in yaks that were farmed together with Tibetan pigs inspired us to determine whether PDCoV is present in Tibetan pigs.

Samples were collected at different time points in Gansu, Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. Of these samples, 105 (60 from Gansu and 45 from Sichuan) were collected in 2016, 84 samples (23 from Gansu and 61 from Qinghai) were collected in 2017, and all samples were subsequently preserved in our laboratory.

Yaks, another livestock living in the same environment as Tibetan pigs, also have a lower prevalence of Hepatitis E virus (HEV)(Xu et al., 2014)  and bovine hokovirus(Xu et al., 2016).Both these studies show the effects of environment to pathogens transmission and infection, and these factors should not be ignored in future studies, especially in studies of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Homology analysis showed that the complete genome and S and N gene sequences of four PDCoV strains from Tibetan pigs shared >96.06% nucleotide identity with all PDCoV strains described in previous studies (Dong et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014). Similar to Hong Kong strain HKU 15-44 and China mainland strain CHN-AH-2004, all PDCoV strains from Tibetan pigs have a 3-nt insertion in their S gene, confirming that the coronavirus detected in Tibetan pigs was a deltacoronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the current PDCoV strains in Tibetan pigs are closely related to strain CHN-AH-2004, which was discovered in Anhui province, mainland China (Dong et al., 2015), and suggests that these strains might have evolved from same ancestors. Our present findings demonstrate a complicated and transregional transmission cycle of PDCoV in China. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree based on S and N genes indicated that MF642322/CHN/GS/2016/1 and MF642323/CHN/GS/ 2016/2 were also located in the same separate subcluster, which is inconsistent with the tree based on complete genome sequences, which placed these strains in separate subbranches. The differences in phylogenetic results among the complete genome and S and N gene sequences of four PDCoV strains from Tibetan pigs indicated that variations existed in other structures of PDCoV during evolution and transmission. However, further research is needed to determine the epidemiology and evolution of PDCoV.In conclusion, diarrhoeal samples collected from Tibetan pigs inhabiting the regions surrounding the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China were screened for the prevalence of PDCoV, and for the first time, we confirmed the presence of PDCoV in Tibetan pigs. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the PDCoV in Tibetan pigs is closely related to strain CHN-AH-2004, which was discovered in Anhui province, mainland China; however, these strains are different, suggest-", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
