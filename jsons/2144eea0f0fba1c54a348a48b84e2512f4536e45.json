To develop these technologies, researchers must broaden their scope of interest and investigate scientific areas that have yet to be fully explored. Lithography is a common name given to technologies designed to print materials onto smooth surfaces. More specifically, micropatterning encompasses the selective binding of materials to surfaces in organized microscale arrays. The selective micropatterning of bacteria and viruses is currently an exciting area of research in the field of biomedical engineering and can potentially offer attractive qualities to biosensing applications in terms of increased sensing accuracy and reliability. This chapter focuses on briefly introducing the reader to the fundamentals of bacterial and viral surface interactions and describing several different micropatterning techniques and their advantages and disadvantages in the field of biosensing. The application of these techniques in healthcare and environmental settings is also discussed.",

            "text": "There is a great need for the development of techniques that can rapidly screen for the presence of infectious diseases or toxic compounds in the human body and the environment (Suh et al. 2004) . Viral outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian flu, have created a rising awareness about toxic and infectious agents in our surroundings. Antimicrobial agents have been developed to help treat patients suffering from exposure to harmful bacteria and viruses; however, bacteria, fungi, and viruses have all begun to develop resistance to the antimicrobial agents directed against them (Moellering 1995) . Microbial resourcefulness and resilience have never been more evident than in their ability to develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (Wood and Moellering 2003) . Bacteria accomplish this through the modification of their DNA by chromosomal mutation and then by acquiring resistance genes via conjugation, transformation, and even transduction (Wood and Moellering 2003 ). An example of this is the demonstration of transferable fluoroquinolone resistance genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae shown by Tran (2002) . Additionally, the emergence of past viruses that were previously eradicated through the delivery of vaccines reaffirms that faster and more reliable techniques to identify viruses and bacteria must be found. This can be seen in the devastating re-emergence of wild poliovirus in Namibia (Roberts 2006) . This recent outbreak has resulted in many deaths and has the potential to become a very serious threat. This example also illustrates the increasing need for bacterial and viral detection on a global basis. With the recent advances in global transportation the ability of a lethal microbial infection to spread across the world is greater now than ever before.",

Techniques such as Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) use two antibodies, one linked to an enzyme and the other specifically bound to an antigen, to identify virus presence (Ivanov and Dragunsky 2005) . The enzyme acts as an amplifier, converting a substrate to a chemogenic or fluorescent signal that is easily detected by a spectrophotometer (Ivanov and Dragunsky 2005) . This technique may be highly sensitive, however, it requires highly trained technicians and high maintenance equipment, which make it unfeasible in many underdeveloped regions of the world (Respess, Rayfield and Dondero 2001) . Another method of cell culturing bacteria involves placing a sample in a plated environment and waiting for colonies of bacteria to form and grow.

First, screening sample volumes can be greatly minimized with the application of micro and nanotechnology. This technology has the potential to significantly reduce to required sample volume for detection testing, therefore making sample collection easier. Secondly, micro and nanopatterning may also be used to increase screening throughput. This is possible because of the potential to test for many different bacteria in a very small volume of sample. Many different bacteria and viruses could be patterned on a single surface, thereby increasing the number of simultaneous detections. Finally, micro and nanopatterning may also offer higher sensitivity than current technologies. This may be attributed to the ability to sense and track bacteria at much smaller scales.",

When a bacterium initially comes in contact with a substrate surface it binds reversibly through non-specific interactions (Bonin, Rontani and Bordenave 2001) . This leads to eventual irreversible binding through the formation of a proteinligand interaction (Razatos et al. 1998) . Therefore, the adhesion of bacterium, and most other cell types, is dependent on the formation of a protein layer on the surface of the substrate. As such, prevention of this protein layer can be applied to create biocompatible materials that resist bacterial adhesion. Such materials include polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers, self assembling monolayers (SAMs) terminated by a PEG group, polysaccharides and phospholipids (Kingshott 1999) . Lipids can also be involved in the initiation of bacterial adhesion, such as on the surface of hydrogel contact lenses (Franklin 1993) ; however, inhibiting protein formation is considered the primary objective when designing biocompatible materials (Kingshott 1999) .",

            "text": "Viral infection of cells is initiated by the attachment of the virus to cell receptors present on the cell membrane (English and Hammer 2005) . Therefore, by inhibiting receptor-mediated attachment, viral infections can potentially be reduced (English and Hammer 2005) . The attachment is mediated by viral attachment proteins (VAPs) which are unique to each individual type of virus (Wickham et al. 1990) . Several virus types have their VAPs and respective receptors identified. For example, Human Immunodeficiency VAP is a 120-kD glycoprotein that binds to a CD4 receptor present on the surface of T-cells (Wickham et al. 1990 ). Although many virus types bind through receptor-mediated binding, the nature of this binding varies quite significantly. This can be in terms of number of VAPs per virus and receptor types as well as binding affinity (Wickham et al. 1990 ). Although receptor-mediated linkages are considered the most common form of viral attachment to cells, there are obviously different methods with which to place viruses onto surfaces. Cheung et al. (2003) report that the fabrication of nanoscale virus arrays can be completed through the placement of a chemoselective linker to the surface of the virus, which enables the virus to attach to a patterned template that is manufactured using scanning probe nanolithography. In another study, Suh et al. (2006) tested the binding affinities of M13 viruses to surfaces using P3 and P9 antibodies. Fig. 32 .1 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the M13 virus on a silicon wafer. Studies such as these may potentially be used to create virus arrays useful for the creation of miniaturized electronic devices or biosensors (Mao 2003) . ",

This technique was first implemented in the integrated circuit fabrication industry and has been adopted into the biomedical field (Xia and Whitesides 1998) . Photolithography involves the placement of the precursor solution onto the substrate of choice. Although there are several variations to photolithography, the main characteristics are the use of a photoresist mask with the pattern of interest and illumination of the precursor solution under UV light. Koh et al. (2003) report that substrate surface can be modified with the use of a polymer. They suggest the first step in photolithography is to make a precursor solution consisting of the polymer to be photopolymerized and a UV light photo-initiator. The precursor solution is then spin coated onto the surface of the substrate in order to ensure that the substrate is covered with a thin, uniform coat. Correspondingly, faster spin coat speeds result in thinner wells, which reduce the overall volume of the well (Koh et al. 2003) . Photopolymerization is then performed under UV light, where only the exposed regions of the precursor solution experience photopolymerization. The areas covered by the mask can then be washed away, leaving the mask's projection patterned on the surface. Disadvantages to photolithography include high costs associated with the equipment necessary to perform this technique, the required access to a clean room and the method's ineffectiveness at patterning non-planar surfaces (Xia and Whitesides 1998) .",

Soft lithography incorporates many different techniques, including replica molding (Ng et al. 2002) , micro contact printing ( CP) (Takayama et al. 1999) , microtransfer molding (Zhao, Xia and Whitesides 1996) and capillary force lithography (Suh et al. 2004) . In most of the aforementioned techniques a stamp is created by molding an elastomer around a replica of the desired pattern, thus creating a negative replica. Most of the research occurring in soft lithographic techniques focuses on the use of PDMS as the elastomer (Ismagilov et al. 2001; Whitesides et al. 2001; McDonald and Whitesides 2002; Ng et al. 2002) . PDMS has many of the desired characteristics of the elastomer, including being biocompatible and permeable to gases. In addition, it can be used for cell culture (Xia and Whitesides 1998) . Softer materials such as PDMS offer exciting alternatives to photolithography due to their decreased costs, chemical versatility and potential biodegradability (Ismagilov et al. 2001; Whitesides et al. 2001 ).",

This process begins with the formation of a structure referred to as a master (Whitesides et al. 2001 ). The master is the original mold that was created through photolithography (as previously described). This master is initially cast in an elastomer, such as PDMS, and allowed to cure. This is accomplished by simply pouring the elastomer over the master mold. Once cured, the elastomer is peeled off of the master and the resulting \"replica\" can then be used in microcontact printing as a stamp. Elastomers are used as the replica material due to their soft structure (Whitesides et al. 2001) . The nature of the master is typically rigid, and therefore the soft nature of the elastomer helps facilitate separation of the two. The master may also be exposed to CF 3 (CF 2 ) 6 (CH 2 ) 2 SiCl 3 overnight to help ease the separation of the master and the elastomer replica (Whitesides et al. 2001 ).",

The stamp produced in replica molding is coated with an alkanthiol and brought into contact with a thin coat of gold that sits on top of a silicon substrate (Whitesides et al. 2001) . When the stamp is removed the alkanethiol leaves a self-assembled monolayer on the surface of the gold. The monolayer self assembles due to the tendency of sulfur atoms in the thiol chain to coordinate the gold surface and expose the terminal groups of the alkanethiol. Sulfur will react similarly with silver; however, gold is only used in bacterial and viral applications because silver is cytotoxic (Whitesides et al. 2001 ). The stamp is then removed and the SAM is left on the surface of the silicon in the shape that is printed on the surface of the stamp. The concentration of the alkanthiol used can affect the quality of the SAM and the resolution of the printed features. Microcontact printing is advantageous in situations where it is desirable to transfer large patterns or series of patterns onto a substrate in one step (Whitesides et al. 2001 ). St. John et al. (1998) used microcontact printing to stamp an antibody grating pattern on a silicon surface in a way as to permit the binding of antigen to the antibody, thus creating a biosensor. The performance of the sensor was tested by encapsulating E.coli cells on the antibody stamped lines and measuring the intensity of a first-order diffraction beam resulting from the attachment. They found that the diffraction intensity increased with cell density on the surface of the antibody.",

Depending on the capillary forces and the surface interactions of the polymer with the stamp, a variety of different polymeric shapes and structures could be formed. The placement of the stamp is followed by a short period of time in which the stamp and the substrate must remain undisturbed. During this time the polymer forms a negative replica of the stamp by spontaneously moving into the stamp's void space via capillary action. If the thickness of the film is small compared to the height of the stamp then the polymer moves to the edges of the stamp rather than fill the void space, where it localizes (Suh, Kim and Lee 2001) . Suh et al. (2004) demonstrated that bacterial cells could be micropatterned using hostparasite and virus-antibody interactions. In this procedure, virus-antibody interactions were introduced to enhance selectivity. It was determined that the adhesion of bacteria was significantly reduced on the surface of PEG when compared to that of silicon or glass (Suh et al. 2004 ). However, it was also determined that non-specific adhesion became evident when the concentration of bacteria was increased (Suh et al. 2004) . This led to a reduction in specificity, which is very undesirable. Fig. 32 .3 illustrates the procedure used for creating bacteria microarrays using capillary lithography.",

When the tip of the microscope is covered with ODT and brought into contact with the surface of the gold, a water meniscus forms between the two. The size of the meniscus is controllable by the relative humidity present on the surface of the gold. The size of the meniscus affects the contact area between the tip and the gold, and correspondingly the resolution of the image. From the development of this novel technique, other forms of nanolithography have begun to emerge. These include nanoshaving, nanowearing and nanografting.

This high pressure creates a high shear force on the attached molecules, which results in their immediate displacement. It is important to note that the load applied by the microscope must be higher than the displacement threshold of the attached molecules. Nanoshaving is commonly used because of its ability to fabricate holes and trenches in a single scan. Nanowearing is quite similar to nanoshaving, the key difference being that a lower force is applied to the molecules over an extended period of time. This allows groups to be gradually removed, a major advantage when working near the edge of a substrate and around sites that have been damaged or defected. Nanografting is another nanoscale technique that uses AFM technology. AFM tips remove molecules from the substrate surface by lightly brushing against their terminal chains. In the case of thiol groups attached to a gold substrate, if the surface of the AFM is immersed in a different thiol, it can be attached to the gold in the place of the removed thiol group.",

The ability to selectively place bacteria and viruses on patterned surfaces presents tremendous opportunities in many different biomedical and biosensing applications. In conjunction with this, the ability to micro and nanopattern proteins capable of binding bacteria and viruses is equally important. Bacterial adhesion to substrate surfaces is typically accomplished by culturing solutions in LB broth and then applying them directly to the micropatterned substrate. The substrates must then be incubated in order to allow the bacteria time to adhere to the surface. Subsequent to the incubation period, the substrates are rinsed with fresh LB media and stained for imaging of the cells (Koh et al. 2003) . Fig. 32 .5 shows several different images of the process of bacterial patterning on a silicon substrate. Viral attachment is completed in much the same manner; however, recent work has been done using nanolithographic techniques and with chemoselective linkers to fabricate similar viral assemblies (Cheung et al. 2003) .

Hemagglutination inhibition assays are based on the conglomeration of erythrocytes in the presence of lectins and other proteins that are capable of the recognition of ligands on the surface of the cell (Goldhar 1995) . The degree of complexity of the carbohydrates presented on the surface of erythrocytes often hinders agglutination; therefore, results from hemagglutination inhibition assays are not always reproducible (Qian et al. 2002) . Solid-phase binding assays generally involve ligand or receptor non-covalent absorption to a surface. Ligand or receptor density is difficult to control, however, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used to block the uncoated surface sites and therefore reduce nonspecific adsorption. Even when the ligands are attached covalently, ligand density can vary, and blocking may be necessary.",

Therefore, SAMs with alkanethiols terminated in oligo(ethylene glycol) groups and alkanethiols terminated with the ligand of interest provide an excellent model surface with which to study bio-interfacial problems (Qian et al. 2002) . This was demonstrated by Qian et al. through the development of arrays of SAMs for the study of bacterial adhesion (2002) . Specifically, the authors studied the adhesion of uropathogenic E.coli, which when bound to mammalian cells in the bladder and/or urinary tract, is a leading cause of urinary tract infections (Barnett and Stephens 1997) . They suggest that SAMs consisting of alkanethiols terminated in oligo(ethylene glycol) groups provide biospecific surfaces that promote the adhesion of uropathogenic E.coli through interactions between multiple pili present on the surface of the bacteria and multiple copies of mannosides present on the SAM surface (Qian et al. 2002) .

Biofilms form on the surfaces of materials when bacteria first adsorb to a material's surface and then excrete a slimy, glue-like substance (commonly called an exopolysaccharide matrix) that anchors them in place (Costerton, Stewart and Greenberg 1999) . Due to their inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents, the development of engineered biofilms could potentially be a valuable tool for understanding their mechanisms of formation and the development of techniques to treat the infections they cause (Stewart and Costerton 2001) . Bos et al. (2000) began research in this area when they used photolithography and the formation of biofilms on teeth and voice prosthesis to illustrate that biofilm preferential growth did not exist between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. Cowan et al. (2001) continued this research with the development of poly-L-lysine (PLL) surfaces to enhance bacterial adhesion to surfaces of interest. Previously, the attachment of OmpR (oroitidine-5'-monophosphate) has been used to promote bacterial attachment to a surface (Vidal et al. 1998) ; however, laboratory strains of E.coli lack the required ompr gene, and therefore are non-adherent. Cowan et al.'s (2001) technique demonstrated that bacteria could be patterned onto surfaces, and artificial biofilms could be engineered. This technology could be potentially applied to fields where biofilm formation is preferred, such as in the reduction of biochemical oxygen demand in the treatment of wastewater (Nicolella, van Loosdrecht and Heijnen 2000) .",

The increased stability of spores, in comparison with other conventional cells used in micropatterning, as well as their ease of manipulation could be of great benefit in the development of cell-based sensors and detectors (Park et al. 2004) . Specifically, microcontact printing has been used to micropattern wells of Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) spores that displayed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Park et al. 2004 ). In the presence of nutrients such as sugars and amino acids the spores germinated into vegetative cells, thus suggesting that any microbial cell could be micropatterned by spatially addressing its spores onto a substrate and then allowing them to germinate. Such cells would include bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi, which are all spore-forming microbial cells.",

The development of micropatterning methods has tremendous implications in the growth of biosensors and biomedical applications. These applications include the development of new and novel antibiotics as well as biomaterials capable of inhibiting bacterial adhesion, which makes them useful for human implantation. The understanding of biofilm formation may also make it possible to inhibit bacterial adhesion, therefore enhancing the capabilities of such biomaterials. The continued miniaturization of lithographic patterning techniques has the potential to enhance patterning resolution, thus creating more bacterial and viral specificity and effectively enhancing the capabilities of prospective biosensors. Correspondingly, continued miniaturization will also help the fight against bacteria that have recently been found to be resistant to traditionally prescribed antibiotics. These developments will be coupled with the goal of reducing the capital costs associated with the equipment necessary to perform these methods and the requirement for skilled technicians to operate this equipment. These aspects could potentially allow these techniques to be used on a worldwide platform, ranging from inside North American laboratories to the far-reaching portions of under-developed societies. This is a crucial aspect of the detection of bacteria and viruses because the spread of these potentially dangerous microbes is far easier today than even ten years ago. The probability of a foreign toxic agent reaching a developed country has become much greater with the advancement of transportation, and this technology is a vital component in the fight against such an attack. If history has taught us anything, it should be that bacterial and viral outbreaks can occur at any place and at any time, and it is in everyone's best interest to be ready for them.",
