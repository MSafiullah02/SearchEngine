Thus, the SARS 3CLpro is indispensable for viral replication but not found in the host cell, which makes the SARS 3CLpro an ideal target for antiviral agents. Numerous studies on substrate-peptide-based and non-peptide inhibitors for SARS 3CLpro have been reported,7, 8 but no therapeutic agents are available at present.",

These results suggest that the cyclohexyl ring might be connected to the peptide chain by a methylene linker, yielding a new non-peptide inhibitor scaffold containing a hydrophobic decahydroisoquinolin ring. The resulting decahydroisoquinolin-type inhibitor 2 was synthesized and confirmed to be an inhibitor as expected, but the potency was moderate (IC50 = 63 \u03bcM).11 The X-ray crystal structure analyses of inhibitor 2 complexed with R188I SARS 3CLpro revealed the lack of interactions covering the P3 to P4 sites of substrate-based inhibitor 1, which suggest that these missing interactions at non-prime sites might be a major reason of the moderate inhibitory activity of 2.",

From the overlay of the structures of 1 and 2, both complexed with R188I SARS 3CLpro, the distance between a 4-position carbon of decahydroisoquinolin ring of 2 and a nitrogen of \u03b1-amine of P2-site Cha in 1 is estimated to be 1.63 \u00c5, nearly the same distance as single C\u2014N covalent bond. This estimation suggests the 4-position carbon of decahydroisoqunolin is a suitable point to introduce a non-prime site substituent to yield a possible non-peptide-based inhibitor 3 (Fig. 2\n). As a non-prime site structure, dipeptide, Ac-Thr-Gly-OH, instead of an original Ac-Thr-Val sequence in 1 was selected since an isopropyl side chain of the Val is directed to an outward of SARS 3CLpro and no interactions with SARS 3CLpro at the Val site is detected (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "Retrosynthetic route for 3 is shown in Scheme 1\n. The non-prime site substituent is introduced via an amino group at 4-position of decahydroisoquinolin ring. With regard to the configuration of the amino group at the 4-position, a preliminary overlay of inhibitor 1 and 2 (Fig. 2) did not eliminate either diastereomer as a non-interacting inhibitor compared with the other, although the 4-S configuration was expected to be preferable. Thus, a synthetic route applicable for the construction of both configurations at the 4-position was employed. P1 site His residue is condensed by reductive-amination via an aldehyde introduced by oxidative cleavage of a terminal olefin at 3-position of decahydroisoquinolin ring of 4. The key intermediate 4 is synthesized from a precursor 5 by Pd(II) catalyzed diastereoselective cyclization.12, 13 The selectivity and efficiency have been well established by our previous syntheses of decahydroisoquinolin scaffold11 and natural products containing piperidine14 and pyrrolidine15 scaffolds. As an acyl substituent of an amino group, the 4-bromobenzoyl group was selected owing to the expected additional interactions with SARS 3CLpro, as inhibitors containing 4-halogenated benzoyl substituents exhibited better inhibitory activities than those containing 4-phenyl substituted benzoyl substituents in our previous study.11 Precursor 5 can be synthesized by conventional homologation and acylation reactions from 6. Amino functional group of 6 is stereoselectively introduced by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation16 followed by Mitsunobu reaction,17 using a commercially available diol compound 7.",

The substitution position was selected by overlay of a substrate-based inhibitor and the fused-ring inhibitor. The inhibitor 26 was synthesized using Pd(II) catalyzed diastereoselective cyclization as a key reaction. Synthesized inhibitor 26 showed a clear but moderate inhibitory activity for R188I SARS 3CLpro. The results strongly suggested increased interactions of inhibitor 26 with SARS 3CLpro at S3 to S4 pocket, although the interactions were expected to be insufficient. Thus, detailed analyses of the interactions based on X-ray crystal analyses of 26 complexed with R188I SARS 3CLpro are the next objects. In addition, it was demonstrated that a thioacetal warhead would be an alternative warhead to aldehyde, which has rather high reactivity causing a possibility of non-selective interactions with proteins. The present data suggested that a combination of thioacetal functional group with decahydroisoquinolin or related fused-ring scaffold would be another approach to design novel inhibitors for SARS 3CL protease, and studies on this line are now underway.",
