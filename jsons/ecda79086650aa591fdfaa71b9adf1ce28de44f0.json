Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular diseases, were highlighted as risk factors for fatality. With a limited sample sized study Guo et al. demonstrated effects of comorbid conditions on cardiac outcomes. Their results could be biased by certain confounders. Cardiotoxicity might also be associated with drugs used in treatment of comorbidities rather than the comorbidity itself. In order to overcome confounders, multivariate analysis is needed which also include comedications along with comorbidities. COVID-19 has high fatality among elderly (>60 years). Excess fatality might also be associated with polypharmacy -commonly seen in elderly-and drug related problems besides comorbidities and the disease itself [3] . hydroxychloroquine related QT-prolongation may also manifest even after hospitaldischarge. We suggest follow-up ECG evaluations for people who receive hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Telemedicine fueled with ECG monitoring could be implemented for follow-ups.",
