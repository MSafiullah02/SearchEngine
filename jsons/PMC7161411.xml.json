Flows (or \u201crates\u201d) change a stock over time by adding to (inflows) or subtracting from that stock (outflows). SD models are well-known for their ability to depict non-linear relationships, which derive from the existence of feedback processes that exist in which actors within a system will later be affected by their actions.19 In this review, we also consider compartmental models from the mathematical epidemiology and ecology literature that describe the disease transmission dynamics and link them to aspects of health care facilities and provision of services that effect outcome. These models similarly take a top-down approach that often assumes continuous time, and they are implemented using differential equations.20\n",

Entities are passive individual objects that possess attributes. These attributes are unique characteristics or features, such as age and health status. Resources, such as those defined in DES, require time to provide a service to an entity, making other entities wait and form a queue. Entities consume resources while they experience events. However, the consumption of those resources does not depend on individual-level entity behavior. As entities use up resources they are indirectly competing with other entities in the queue.22 DES allows for capturing the effect of variability, stochasticity, and randomness of multiple elements within a system, but it does not explicitly model feedbacks or interactions between entities.23\n",

They live in the environment, and they sense it. They decide what action to employ at a certain time on the basis of their own state, their own defined decision rules and the environment state (including other agents with which they interact). Agents can have explicit targets to minimize or maximize, and they can also learn and adapt based on experience. Agent-agent and agent-environment interactions result in the update of the internal state of the agents or a decision on their next actions. Similarly, the state of the environment can update. As agents and the environment interact and evolve or potentially co-evolve, micro- and macro-level patterns emerge. We also view similar microsimulation and individual-based models from the mathematical epidemiology and ecology literature as ABMs in this review, although in these models the entities are often only reflexive and do not make autonomous decisions.",

DES was then adopted to simulate the transmission dynamics of nosocomial influenza in a LTCF. As the prevalence of influenza virus in the community influences the rate at which patients, health care workers (HCWs) and visitors introduce the virus when they enter the LTCF, the prevalence and the incidence of infections generated by the SD model were passed to the DES model. This hybridization improved understanding of transmission dynamics of nosocomial influenza in a LTCF by taking into consideration the impact of infection prevalence in the community on that LTCF.

More than one-third of the included publications did not state any sort of validation (24 studies). Almost one-half of the simulation models that contained stochastic element (30 studies) were validated by using the single approach of internal validity, in which several simulations were performed to assess their stochastic variability. The lack of consistency in a model's results may cause the appropriateness of the investigated system or the strategy and/or policy to be questionable.51 Historical data validation, which uses a part of the collected data other than the data used for model building to test if the model behaves as the real system does,51 was found to be used as the single method of validation in 4 other studies (6%). Other validation methods were rarely used. Recent simulation models combined multiple validation methods to achieve a more thorough validation approach.37\n,\n39\n,\n42\n,\n49\n,\n50\n,\n52, 53, 54, 55, 56 With respect to the different simulation methods, approximately one-half of SD and hybrid simulation models depicted a validation approach, whereas a higher proportion was observed for the ABM and DES models (ie, 73% and 86%, respectively). More than one-half of the hybrid simulation models that included a validation method used combinations of validation approaches. This number occupied one-third of all of the models using mixed approaches to validation. Only 1 out of a total of 68 studies described how verification was conducted, using good documentation of the model building process, and randomly checking whether the simulated behaviors of selected agents of each type matched the intended behaviors of the conceptual model.49\n",

Simulation models for HAIs have also become more complex in terms of the settings being modeled. Earlier studies generally modeled a single ward (usually an ICU) or a simplified hospital lacking of any further ward structure whereas more recent studies were likely to incorporate different types of wards (ICUs and general wards), as well as consider the transmission across health facilities (eg, mainly between hospitals), and the community. Future studies could investigate interactions with LTCFs, other types of health care facilities, and the community to provide a more realistic estimate of HAI incidence and prevalence, and the effectiveness of IPC policies. Pediatric settings were rarely considered although pediatric patients have higher rates of viral lower respiratory tract infections and bloodstream infections than adults, especially those younger than 2 years of age and those demanding care in neonatal ICUs and pediatric ICUs.95\n",

Simulation modeling studies have hardly considered direct HCW-to-HCW contact or interactions between visitors/caregivers and patients. Visitors and/or family caregivers can play a very important role in infection transmission in a health facility, especially in settings such as pediatric or geriatric health facilities where patients often need extra care. In many cultures including Asian countries and LMICs, having visitors and caregivers on a regular basis is common practice and sometimes encouraged owing to a considerable shortage of staff and a need to reduce medical costs to patients.56 Because visitors and caregivers are also more mobile than patients, they are both highly susceptible to contracting infections and potentially able to transmit pathogens to various locations inside and outside as the hospital.78\n",

It is easier and thus preferable for modeling the heterogeneity of a small population like an ICU rather than a large population setting.97 Health care settings in general and ICUs, in particular, are spatially intricate environments where complex interactions between specific sets of individuals are a key driver of transmission. Not every primary physician, consultant, and nurse see every patient, leading to a highly heterogeneous social and contact network.36 Diagnostic uncertainty (ie, whether an individual is infected is not always known) also complicates the transmission of HAIs. This accentuates the importance of impacts of stochastic interactions and chance events upon the transmission and spread of HAIs. ABM can also help understand the influence of different patient referring and transferring patterns among health care facilities within a network owing to variations in their geographical locations, policies, services provided and variations in individuals\u2019 decision. A limitation of ABM is the requirement of reliable and detailed data for model building and validation, which are not always readily available.61 Higher levels of behavioral detail produced by ABM causes greater computational intensity, and difficulty in performing model parameterization and extensive uncertainty analyses, which are essential for reliable predictions. As ABM and hybrid models become increasingly popular, the adoption of more sophisticated methods and mixed methods for sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation were more frequently observed in more recently published studies.",

Nor can it capture feedbacks in a system as SD does.

Because all 3 simulation modeling methods have different benefits, limitations, strengths, and weaknesses, mixing methods potentially overcome some of the drawbacks faced by using a single approach and/or provide more plausible explanations of a problem, which a single method on its own could not handle. For example, SD is useful in providing a holistic view of the feedback dynamics of HAI transmission in a complex health care system but cannot take account of the heterogeneity of individual patients and HCWs, and the stochasticity resulting from their behaviors and interactions, which are the distinct features of ABM. As health care systems are highly complex, dynamic and interconnected, HAIs and other problems in the context of health care gained from different simulation modeling methods may benefit from the complementary view gained from using multiple simulation modeling methods together.

            "text": "This review provides an overview of the development and application of systems simulation modeling in HAIs from which gaps of research in this field can be identified. First, the transmission patterns of HAIs in LMICs require further studies because they are likely to be dramatically different from those in HICs owing to many factors such as poor infrastructure, insufficient environmental hygiene conditions, different staff cohorting, shortage of HCWs, the knowledge and compliance of HCWs to IPC measures, overcrowded health care facilities, absence of comprehensive IPC guidelines and policies, lack of procedure, and different antibiotic prescribing and referral patterns. Second, pediatric hospitals and other types of health care setting-like LTCFs, as well as interactions between settings were not extensively investigated. Furthermore, understanding of patient sharing and referring networks among health care facilities driven by operational and financial alliances needs to be improved. Third, the number of studies adopting hybrid simulation models are still limited, possibly because of the unavailability of clear guidelines and frameworks for hybrid model development. Because it is argued that most, if not all, real-world problems tackled with simulation modeling cannot be solved by SD, DES or ABM alone but require a combination of 2 or all of them, a hybrid model resulting from this combination expectedly offers different perspectives of a problem and generate more insights, which will provide better understanding and greater support for decision-making.100 The use of simulation modeling for economic analysis of different IPC measures and strategies has increased but is still relatively scarce. The application of this methodology to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various IPC strategies is promising in a sense that it can appropriately guide and prioritize the allocation of limited resources and funds. Additionally, an understanding of other kinds of interactions in the health care setting apart from interactions between doctors and/or nurses and patients is insufficient. Last, the evaluation of clinical and cost effectiveness was only conducted for a number of commonly used interventions like hand hygiene, isolation, and screening, further investigation on other IPC measures and a combination of different strategies is imperative to determine best practice in various health care settings. Models can also be developed to simulate coordination and collaboration among health facilities to assess the impact of a regional IPC program.",
