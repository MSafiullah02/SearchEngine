We take exception to this view. In many ways, Nipah virus is not unlike other viruses including Ebola, Marburg, SARS, and MERS. All of these viruses result in zoonotic diseases that have the potential for human-to-human transmission, high mortality rates, and cause diseases for which there are no readily available diagnostic tests, no effective treatments, no vaccines, and for which only supportive treatment is available.",

Nipah viruses adapted to and spread rapidly among pigs in Malaysia in 1998, leading to a large outbreak that required urgent containment measures. Over a million pigs were culled; the swine industry was devastated. More than 300 humans were infected and developed encephalitis, and one-third died. Currently, Bangladesh is the only country reporting Nipah encephalitis. But in recent decades, other countries \u2013 including Malaysia, India, and Singapore \u2013 have been adversely affected by the disease.",

This led to billions of dollars in economic loss and required extraordinary measures to eliminate the disease. MERS is currently sputtering along in Middle Eastern countries with short chains of human transmission. It has an approximately 50 per cent case fatality rate.",

Frequent transmission to health-care workers highlights the need for more effective infection control measures. Infection of health-care workers causes not only illness and death, but also the flight of coworkers who fear becoming infected. Over 800 health-care workers have been infected during the current West Africa Ebola epidemic, causing nearly 500 deaths. Quarantine and isolation of workers caring for patients infected with such deadly diseases has become a subject of great controversy. A recent article explores the challenge associated with health-care workers returning to India after caring for patients potentially infected with MERS.2",

The more cases that occur and the more generations of transmission that take place, the greater the likelihood that the virus will further adapt, potentially leading to sustained human-to-human transmission. Nipah has already been shown to have some capacity for human-to-human transmission; the virus spread to 22 caretakers in one incident in Bangladesh. Nipah virus also has a high rate of mutation. To restrict its opportunities for adaptation to humans, it is important to get the number of cases as close to zero as possible. Reducing Nipah virus transmission to humans in Bangladesh is important to decrease this looming global threat.",

Arguments about its relatively low current burden of disease are unconvincing when the threat of introduction into densely populated urban centers is large for Nipah and for a number of other emerging infectious diseases that have the potential for spread, domestically and internationally. That it takes a long time to develop a vaccine or effective therapeutic drug is reason to start now, before an emergency starts.",

Ministers of health and key policymakers should not be lulled into thinking that the best use of resources is to allocate them only to the most obvious current problems. The biggest public health impact against an infectious disease is often when the numbers are small. Good public health sense would suggest that ignoring many of the emerging zoonotic diseases today because they exhibit a low burden of disease may result in catastrophic problems tomorrow.",
