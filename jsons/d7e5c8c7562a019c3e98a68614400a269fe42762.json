            "text": "The ECAT Angina Pectoris (AP) Study is a multicentered prospective study to establish an association between plasma levels of haemostasis parameters and the risk of a coronary event in patients with AP. 3043 patients were recruited in 18 European clinics. Before coronary angiography, blood was collected from each patient to perform 23 haemostasis assays, mainly coagulation and fibrinolysis assays and patients were followed-up for 2 years. After adjustment for other known risk factors, age, sex and drug use, 3 assays, i.e. fibrinogen, yon Willebrand Factor (vWF) and tissue-Plasminogen Activator antigen (t-PA ag) remained significantly (P -< 0.02) increased in the event group. The predictive value of fibrinogen is in line with results of large eipidemiological studies. As plasma levels of the acute-phase reactant C-Reactive Protein (CRP) appeared to be higher in patients at risk, and as CRP was strongly correlated to fibrinogen levels at baseline, the increase of fibrinogen in patients at risk may be due, at least partially, to a continuous low-grade inflammatory response. It may reflect the progression of atherosclerosis. Some of the previously established risk markers can now. be understood in terms of inflammatory reactions. Increased levels of vWF and t-PA ag point to activation or damage of endothelial cells. We conclude that the ECAT AP Study is the first prospective study to reveal an association between haemostasis risk markers and reactions involved in the injury of the vessel wall. Whether increased levels of haemostasis factors in angina pectoris patients cause arterial thrombosis is likely, but definite proof is lacking.",

A specific sandwich itrmunoassay was described by Scheefers-Borche [ et aL. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 (1985) 7091-7095) . A novel fibrin sandwich imrmnoassay was developed based on streptavidine pre-coated tubes. For inmJnization we used the synthetic N-terminal heptapoptide Gty-Pro-Arg-Vat-Vat-Gtu-Arg of human fibrin alpha chain. The new assay was designed with the sane fibrin specific antibody both in biotinytated and in peroxidase-LabaLed form. ALthough the binding epitope is present twice on the fibrin molecule, fibrin in plasma can be detected only after pre-incubation with chaotropic ions. Obviously this reftects the situation of fibrin present in plasma, being hidden by complex formation ~ith itself, fibrinogen, split products, or even others. It could be shown by Dempfte et aL. 1992 (submitted to BLood Coagulation and FibrinoLysis) that by treatment with gCN\" ions fibrin aggregates dissociate and fibrin gets measured in its nlonomeric form. Measuring range extends up to 50 Ag/m[. Precison of the method is satisfactory, intra-assay CVs using plasma samples range between 5.0 (23.7 #g/mr) and 12.4 ~ (0.2 #g/mL). Lower detection Limit is 0.12 ~g/mt. Investigations of normal range in 70 age-matched healthy individuals resutted in a mean of 1.12 #g/mL. No cross reactivity with fibrinogen, fibrinogen split products or fibrin D-dircer could be observed, fibrin E1 fragment (oempfte et aL. 1992 ) and the fibrin fragments X and Y revealed a moderate cross reactivity.",

            "text": "First clinical investigations indicate significantly Lowered fibrin plasma levels in patients under Long-term and stable oral anti-coagulation (0.21 ~ 0.08 gg/ml) as compared to a symptom-free non-anticoagutated control group with a history of venous thrombosis (1.82 \u2022 0.34 #g/ml). In conclusion the new assay allows a very sensitive detection of soluble fibrin in plasma. Measurement of intravascular thrombin has remained elusive. We studied hirudin as active-site directed probe for in vivo thrombin during administration of hirudin to humans with stable coronary disease. Methods. After start of a six hour (h) infusion of r-hirudin, administered at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg/h to 6 humans each, thrombin was measured as intravascular thxombin-hirudin complex (84% endogenous thrombin) during 24 hours. Free hirudin was present in 10,0O0-fold to 20-fold molar excess of thrombin. Despite activated partial thromboplastin times of 2.3-3.0 fold baseline, the plasma thrombin-hirudin complex steadily accumulated at an average rate of 70-+10 (mean-+SE) pg/mljhour, from 790-+85 pg/ml at 15 rain to 2670-+650 pg/ml at 24 hours (slope p<0.0001). No significant differences in thrombin-hirudin complex were noted between the three hirudin dosage groups. Plasma thrombin-antitln~ombin HI complex decreased from 7.6-+3.3 ng/ml at baseline to 1.7 ng/ml at 6 hours and returned to baseline 18 hours after completion of the hirudin infusion (8.7-+4.0 ng/ml, p=us relative to baseline). Conclusion. Prothrombin activation in vivo continues during anticoagulation with hirudin. The thrombin-hfrudin complex has potential as a measure of thrombin generation during kiredin therapy. Hirudin inhibits formation of the thrombin-antithrombin HI complex which therefore may have limited usefulness as marker of pmthrombin activation during anticoagulafion with himdin. Arid-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) have been identified in a variety of connective tissue diseases, in vssculitis as wall as in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (1-1\"P). Moreover, a correlation between the titre of AECA and the clinical feature has been repoded. Therefore, detection and quantification of AECA is of clinical intarest. To determine AECA quantitatively, a cellular ELISA using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as target calls has been developed. Since HUVEC express the AB0 blood group antigens on their surface, only HUVECs of blood group 0 were used to prevent false positive results. HUVECs ware cultured on 96er wall microtitar plates, fixed with acatone-mathanol, and overlaid with serum in dilutions of 1:200 and 1:500, respectively. Bound immunoglobulins were datected by peroxidese-labelled antibodies monospecific for human IgG or IgM. The amount of heund immunoglobulin was quantified using a standard curve prepared with purified IgG/IgM coated on the same ELISA plate in wells not containing calls and devaloped using the same detection system. Studying 91 healthy volunteers (39 females, 52 males) the following concentrations (mean ,~ SO) of e~..do~!i~ c~!l bou.,~d !gG and [gM were obtained: 0.99 ~ 0.5 ng IgG/l(f HUVEC and 0.45 + 0.23 ng IgM/lO a HUVEC. The amount of bound immunoglobulin was neither influenced by the age or sex of the volunteers nor by the total plasma concentration of IgG or IgM. Based on these data a serum sample was scored positive for AECA when the amount of bound IgG/IgM e~(ceeded the concentration of 2.0/1.0 ng/lO ~ HUVEC. In 7 out of 10 patients with acute or chronic relapsing \"l-rP, AECA of IgG subclass were identified. Two patients were positive for tgM AECA and only one patient was negative fOr AECA. There was a strong correlation between the concentration of AECA and the disease activity of \"r3\"P as judged from the platelet count indicating that AECA may play a major pathophysiological role in \"I-I'P. Moreover, determination of AECA is a useful paramatar to verify the diagnosis of \"[-I'P in patients who are clinically suspected of \"I-I'P. Furthermore, the data presented demonstrate that the cellular ELISA provides a useful tool to quantify AECA and to study their role in the pathogenesis of diseases associated with endothelial call dysfunction.

Fibrinogen reagents predominantly used for routine coagulation testing work according to the measuring principle introduced by Clauss in 1957. A common feature of these reagents is the necessity to use prediluted samples for measurement. A newly developed reagent (Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany) working as well according to the Clanss method enables to measure undiluted samples over a wide measuring range from 0.8 to >12 g/l. This could be achieved by the use of a peptide inhibitor of fibrin aggregation. It enables to adjust the aggregation speed of fibrin to the desired time frame. Coagulation time can easily be determined by various standard instruments including photometric equipment. Reference curves are about twofold more steep than with the known reagents. This allows for improved precision and accuracy. For evaluation, this new reagent was compared with common reagents for fibrinogen determination (Mnltifibren, Behringwerke AG; Data-Fi Fibrinogen Determination Reagents, Baxter Diagnostics, Miami, FL, USA) as well as the measurement of derived fibriuogen (using Tbromborel S, Behringwerke AG). Anal)'sis wcre carried out using KC I0 (Amclung, Lemgo, Gcrmany), Fibrintimer A (Behringwerke AG), Electra 1000 C (MLA, Pleasantville, NY, USA) and ACL (Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy). Samples used for evaluation were from normal patients and patients undergoing lysis therapy as well as samples with increased fibrinogen content due to acute phase reaction. The results show a good reproducibility of measurements. Intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%) for fibrinogen determination (g/l) in control and patient plasma samples i.e. with the Fibrintimer A were between 0.6 and 8.9. Method correlation studies using Multifibren and Multifibren U in parallel yielded a good cos'elation of results with the KC I0 (r = 0.928) as well as the Fibrintimer A (r = 0.982). Similar data could be shown for comparison with Data-Fi (with KC 10) as well as derived fibrinogen using Thromborel S on the Electra 1000 C and the ACL, thus demonstrating the good usability of Multifibren U for routine testing in coagulation laboratories. A novel murine monoclonal antibody against fibrin a-chain N-terminus is presented, which reacts with desAA-and desAABB-fibrin. In immunoblot procedures, the antibody reacts with fibrin degradation products X, and Y of noncrosslinked fibrin, and fibrin degradation product E. No binding is observed to fibrin fragment D-dimer, and fibrinogen fragments D, and E. Minor binding to fibrinogen fragments X, and Y, and desBB-fibrin are due to contamination with (desAA)-fibrin. Prerequisite for binding is release of fibrinopeptides A, the binding site being a fibrin-specific neo-epitope. No binding is observed to fibrinogen, and to thrombin-treated abnormal dysfibrinogen MANNHEIM III (Aal6 Arg~Cys) molecules, which do not release fibrinopeptides A. The antibody binds to abnormal fibrin molecules prcp~rz~ ~om dys~b~\"-.'noSen ~ ^.wW]-[~!~ ! (An ! 9 Ar~O!y), albeit to a lesser extent as compared to normal fibrin. Binding of the antibody to the fibrin epitope is greatly enhanced by denaturation, e.g. by heat, or by treatment with chaotropic ions. Soluble fibrin in clinical samples is generally found as complex with fibrinogen, since polymerization sites 'A' exposed by release of fibrinopeptides A react with complementary binding sites 'a' on D-domains of other fibrin and fibrinogen molecules. Treatment of samples with NaSCN or KSCN causes dissociation of fibrin monomer complexes. Re.association is prevented by denaturation of both polymerization sites 'A' and %'. The antibody in combination with NaSCN-treatment of samples is useful for specific and sensitive detection of fibrin monomer in plasma samples. Measurement is not influeneed by fibrinogen degradation products, whereas fibrin degradation pro ducts at very high concentration cause some underestimation of fibrin monomer concentration. A new method has been developed for the quantitative determination of fibrin-and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in plasma. An epitope hidden in intact molecules is exposed after cleavage of fibrin(ogen) by plasmin. A synthetic peptide of this new carboxy terminus has been used for immunization of rabbits. Antibodies isolated by immunoabsorption against a partial sequence of this peptide did not react with intact fibrinogen or fibrin, but recognized equally well all fragments E liberated from fibrinogen (AABB-Ea), crosslinked (E 1 and E2) and non cross-linked fibrin (E3).",

The presence of heparin as a contaminant in coagulation test samples may cause abnormal results which may lead to additional labratory tests or inappropriate therapy. Current methods for the removal of heparin, like protamine sulfate or ionic exchanger are cumbersome and may remove also coagulation proteins. We describe a simple procedure for an enzymatic degradation of heparin using heparinase I. This enzyme depolymerises heparin by hydrolytic cleavage of glycosidic linkages leading to inactive split products. The stabilized enzyme is provided in ready to use vials (Hepzym e~ ). Plasma is dispensed into the vial and after 15 minutes the heparin is degraded. The procedure was evaluated in several coagulation assays. In 34 normals the aPTT was 25.4",

            "text": "Baxter Diagnostics, Miami USA , and Unterschleissheim, D* Perspective studies demonstrate that fibrinogen levels are an important and independent variable in the prediction of thrombotic events in atherosclerotic patients. Molecular studies show a positive correlation between levels of fibrinogen and the presence of restriction enzyme polymorphism HAE IIL There are some controversies about influence of fibrinogen genotype on plasmatic levels of fibrinogen. We decided to address the controversy by looking at the correlation between fibrinogen levels and HAE Ill polymorphism. For these reasons, we decided to study some patients with previous ischemic stroke. We enlisted 72 patients, 36 males and 36 females with previous ischemic stroke documented by CT or NMR ; their mean age was 66\u2022 Fibrinogen levels were measured by the Clauss method and patients' DNA was purified by mononuclear cells by phenobcloroform extraction. A portion of the fibrinogen 13 gene was ampified by PCR technique and digested with HAE III restriction enzyme. Fibrinogen level was 373+87 in our patients. Frequency of the allele with the HAE III alternative restriction site (H1) was 0,802; that of the allele without the HAE 111 alterative restriction site (H2) 0,198. In our study group, 24 patients were heterozygous (H1 H2) and 46 homozygous (HI H1) ; 2 were homozygous for the allele without the enzyme alternative restriction site. Fibrinogen level was 363+83 for H1H1; 390\u2022 for H1H2; and 305\u2022 for H2H2. No significant difference was found between the groups. The proportion of the phenotypic variance in fibrinogen values associated with fibrinogen genotype was estimated as described by Sing and Davignon and was found to be 3,6%. Alchool ingestion, smoking and hypertension were found to be as strong as the genetic variation in helping predict plasma fibrinogen levels. Our data demonstrate an association between 13 chain polymorphism and fibrinogen levels in patients with prevoius ischemic stroke, and document a role for personal and enviromental factors in the regulation of plasma fibrinogen levels. The molecular basis of hereditary type I (n=ll) and type II (n=3) protein C (PC) deficiency was studied in a panel of 14 unrelated Austrian families. By direct sequencing of the nine exons and their splice junctions sequence alterations were found in one of the PC alleles in all but one subjects. 10 were found to be heterozygous for a single point mutation in the PC gene, one for two point mutations, one for a 6 bp insertion and one for a 15 bp deletion. In one proband with type I deficiency no genetic abnormality was found. Within this panel no recurrent mutations were observed. The three missense mutations associated with a type II deficiency were located in three different regions of the protein C gene and resulted in changes in the thrombin activation site (169Arg-4 Gin), in the histidine residue (211His--r Gln) that forms part of the catalytic triad and in the carboxyterminal part of the catalytic domain (343Met-~lle). In 11 of 14 cases DNA from family members was available and cosegregation of the PC deficiency with the mutation was observed. Only two of the genetic defects (157Arg-~Stop and 178Arg ~ Gin) have been found previously in other geographic areas. These data confirm the large genetic heterogeneity of PC deficiency. and synthetic phospholipids (innovin TM, Baxter Code \"i\")) was evaluated in an international field trial. The study was designed in a way that 4 laboratories in 4 different countries all used a comparable instrument (Electra 900/1000 C respectively) and either human placental or rabbit brain thromboplastins of comparable sensitivity (IS! ca. 1.28 on Electra versus 1.0 for Innovin). Mean valses of normals were 10.9, ll.0, 10.9, and 11.2 sec with an overall mean of 11.0 sec and a 2 SD range of 9.5 -12.5 sec. Results from patients with liver disease, DIC, congenital factor deficiencies and during cumarin treatment were comparable between the different reagents. In a few cases during intensive oral anticoagulation (INR > 3)where \"I\" gave slightly higher INR values then the two conventional thromboplastins. This was found especially in patients with low levels of factor Vli in comparison to factor II or X. This result was in agreement with in vitro studies in which it was shown that Innovin was more factor sensitive than conventional thromboplastins, especially for factor VII. On the other hand a comparison against BCT 253 was perfectly linear (r = 0.98,y = 0.99x -0.01). Precision studies showed a better reproducability from day to day for both for the calibration curve (required for the percentage system), in lyophilized controls or in patient plasmas, especially in samples with long clotting times. In addition also excellent comparability of the instruments was observed when the same lot of reagents and controls were used {c.V. 1.5 -3.9 % ) . These results demonstrate that the reagent based on recombinant tissue factor showed advantages over conventional tissue thromboplastins in respect to handling and precision and that it may improve the quality of PT testing.

M011er-Berflhaus T~sue factor ('l'F)/factor Vlla (FVIla) complex initiates the extdnsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. We produced several murine monoclonal antibodies (mab) against FVfi/FVIla to characterize their interactions in detail and to develop a sandwich EUSA for determination of F'Vll in plasma. FVII was purified 100,000-fold from human plasma. During the isolation procedure, activalJon did not occur so that a FVll preparation was obtained free of datecteble Wile. This FVII preparation and activated recombinant FVIla (rFVIla) were used for immunization and screening of mab's. Five clones were selectod from a panel of more than 50 mab's, and IgG was purified from cell culture supematants by protein G sepherose. The affinity of these mabe to FVII and rFVlla was verified by EUSA tech~que. Despite mab MNSO detects rFVtla with a higher affinity thsa FVII, none of the mab's reacts exclusively with FVII or rFVIla. The affinity varied from 5 to 20 pM. Western-hint analysis revealed, that 3 mabs (NM13, NM15, NMSO) recognized an epitope localized on the heavy chain of FVII, When these mabs were used in a one-stage clotting assay, the dotting time was prolonged at least 3-fold. The mabs NM39 and NM18 detected a calcium-depur=d~t contormational change of the antigen. These antibodies could not detect denatured and reduced FVII/FVIla using ELISA or immunoblot techniques. As demonstrated in a modified clotting assay and in a ligand-blot, mab NM39 strongly and rapidly inhibited the clotting activity of a preformed TF/FVIla complex in a purified system as wall as in plasma, but did not prevent the association of FVll and TF, suggesting that NM39 interferes with FIX and/or FX for binding to TF/FVlta. Among the different combinations of these five mabs tested, no combination was found to be sensitive enough to detect FVII in plasma. Therefore a cocrmrmrcially evallal01e polydonal FVII antibediy was used as catching antibody and bound FVII was subsequently detected by mab NM50, showing the highest affnity to FVII. This sandwich EUSA allowed to determine plasma FVII, as tested in 20 healthy volunteers and two patients with inherited FVII defmiencies. These data indicate, that the FVII EUSA described offers a new opportunity to determine FVII antigen in plasma of patients suspected for inherited or acquired FVII def'miencies.",

This inhibiter reacts with t-PA in vitro after the blood collection. To avoid erroneous low t-PA measurements in vitro interaction of t-PA and PAI-f should be prevented. A large quantity of PAl-1 is contained in the alpha granules of platelets. It is possible that during blond sampling and processing PAI-t release might cause elevations of its plasma values. Therefore different anticoagulants and temperatures of blood storage on t-PA and PAl determination should be compared. Samples were collected from 10 healthy volunteers (5 males and 5 females), aged 25 -55 years. Venous blond was taken between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. and divided into 3 different anticoagulants: A-3,8 % tdsedium citrate (Sarstedt); B-Stabilyte tubes (Biopool) containing a low pH citrate anticoagulant which stabilises t-PA activity by blocking inhibition of t-PA by PAl; C-CTAD tubes (Stago). One of each tubes was precooled and after filling placed in crushed ice-water. A duplicate of each tubes was stored by room temperature. Blood was centrifuged 60 minutes after collection for 20 minutes at 4\"C. Plasma was stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. For determination of I-PA and PAl the following commercial kits were used: t-PA concentration: TintElize TM Biopool; t-PA activity: Spectrolyse TM/Fibdn Biopool; PAl antigen; PAI-f Elisa Technoclone; active PAl-1 antigen: Actibind Technoclone. Samples, anticoagulatnd and stored in different temperatures after the blond collection, gave similar values of t-PA antigen. The t-PA activity was higher in Stabilyte-tubes than in citrate as well as CTADtubes, the highest activity was measured in cooled Stabilyte samples. The lowest PAl antigen showed plasma samples collected in coo{ed StabUyteand CTAD-tubes whereas the highest PAl antigen was obtained in citrate plasma stored by room temperature. The slight difference between whole PAl antigen and active PAl antigen in samples collected in cooled Stabilyte tubes indicates a small part of latent and of inactive PAl in this plasma. The results indicates, that the Stabilyte solution prevent the inhibition of t-PA by PAl and the release of PAl from platelets. Blood should be collected in precoold tubes and placed in ice-water immediately after sampling. Stabityte solution is a useful anticoagulant for determination of t-PA and PAl in plasma.",

Binding of t-PA is performed during 1 h at room temperature and after washing a mixture of plasminogen and the sensitive plasmin substrate S-2403 is added followed by incubation at 37~ Depending upon the t-PA activity, the incubation times may vary from 15 min (0.5-5 IU/mL) to 60 min (0.017-0.6 IU/mL). For proper t-PA activity determinations blood sampling is preferably made in acid buffer (e.g. Stabilyte | Biopool), which prevents inactivation of t-PA by PAI-1 in vitro. Acidified plasma is then mixed with water in the well, maintaining a pH of 6 also during binding of t-PA and hence preventing t-PA inhibition. Using this procedure for pre-oeelusion t-PA activity determinations in 40 healthy individuals (age 20-65), a median value of 0.47 IU/mL was obtained with a range of 0.05-1.3 IU/mL. As a comparison, paraUell sampling in ordinary citrate resulted in a median value of 0.03 IU/mL (range 0-0.5 IU/mL). An estimation of potential t-PA inhibitory capacity is obtained by substituting water with a buffer which raises pH to above 7 and thus allows PAI-1 interference during the binding phase. A four-fold decrease or more of the t-PA activity is associated with strongly elevated levels of PAl-1 activity. Thus, by using water and buffer in parallell as diluents in the same assay, information on both the sample t-PA activity and PAl-1 activity will be obtained.",

Obviously for calculation of the test results it will be of advantage to have the analyte fibrin present in a definite and homogenous form. Measuring range extends up to 50 pg/ml. Precision of the method is satisfactory, intra-assay CVs using plasma samples range betwean 5.0 % (23.7 i~Jml) and 12.4 % (0.2 i~g/ml). Lower detaction limit is 0.12 f~g/ml. No cross reactivity with fibrinogen, fibcinogen split products or ill.in D-dimer could be observed. In conclusion the new assay allows a very sensitive detection of soluble fibrin in plasma enabling profound insights into the individual activation state of blood coagulation in patients. In 130 patients with abdominal surgery and thrombosis prophylaxis as usual fibrin monomers (FM) were determined using the FM ELISA test from Boehringer Mannheim. In parallel FI+ 2 and TAT (Behringwerke Marburg) were investigated Plasma samples were taken prior to operation and postoperativly. Screening for DVT was carried out by 125-/-labelled fibrinogen test. Positive results were checked by phlebography. Elevated FM evels were obtained in 11 of 12 patients with postoperative DVT two days before the diagnosis by phlebography. On the other hand in only 28 % of patients without DVT FM levels were elevated. These results lead to a sensitivity of 91,7 % and a specifity of 72 %. These results suggest that FM ELISA could be a marker of ongoing thrombosis. We have evaluated a novel ELISA system for fibrin monomer (FM) for the identification of patients with cerebral ischemic insult and hemiparesis developing deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The test employs a monoclonal antibody against a fibrin-specific neo-epitope on the N-terminus of fibrin <a-chain and pretreatment of samples with thiocyanate in order to expose and stabilize the epitope. The test was compared with other activation parameters of blood coagulation, such as D-dimer ELISA, TAT-ELISA, prothrombin fragment Fl+2 ELISA, and tests for soluble fibrin based on the potentiation of plasminogen activation by tPA in presence of soluble fibrin complexes. Patients were monitored sequentially by Doppler ultrasound, Duplex scans, and clinical examination during a period often days after admission. The patients with DVT displayed a 50-250fold increase of FM-ELISA values over normal range. A parallel increase was detected for D-dimer, although maximum values measured were only approximately 5-10fold of normal range upper cutoff value. The correlation of FM-ELISA and D-dimer was R=0.94. There was no significant correlation between FM-ELISA and TAT (R=0.25), and prothrombin fragments Fl+2 (R=0.02), or between F 1+2 and TAT (R=0.21). Correlation of FM-ELISA with tests for soluble fibrin based on potentiation of plasminogen activation was R=0.71, but results obtained using the latter test system appeared to be quite inconsistent due to the variable composition of circulating soluble fibrin complexes and unpredictable in vitro effects. D-dimer ELISA has been shown by various authors to be a valuble parameter for identification of patients with an activated state of blood coagulation, such as present in acute DVT. FM-ELISA displays an excellent correlation with D-dimer with the advantage of a higher sensitivity and considerably less overlap of pathological and normal range.",

Thus, a daily coagulation monitoring including FM and F1+2 significantly reduces the rate of SAT after stent implantation. It seems that a further reduction could only be achieved by more than one determination per day. In two patients suffering SAT it could clearly be demonstrated that an increase in FM > 5 mg/I preceded the occlusion which then is followed by a release of troponin T, a specific myocardial marker. Elevated concentrations of fibrin monomer in plasma indicate, that the activation state of the coagulation system has already reached the point of fibrinogen -fibrin conversion. Monitoring fibrin monomer in plasma might help to optimize individual adjusted anticoagulant therapy.

Therapeutic and scientific use calls for precise and sensitive methods for quantification in body fluids, tissues and ceils. In this paper we describe different methods of labeling heparins. Tyramine, a 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylamin, was selectively conjugated to heparin by endpoint attachment. Fractions of heparintyramine with Mw--5821 D (108 aXa U/mg and 46 alia U/mg) and with Mw=3775 D (85 aXa U/mg and 15 alia U/mg) were collected by size exclusion gel permeation chromatography (GPC). NMR data confmrg, d attachment of one tyramine per 20 disaccharide units. This product was labeled with 125iodine at the aryl residue. A competitive binding assay for heparin using the labeled product was developed. Heparin was also labeled with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate. The MW of this preparation was 3775 D and the anticoagulant activity 70 aXa U/mg and 20 aIIa U/mg. The yellow product absorbs at 200, 237, 380, 440, and 480 ran. The absorption at 480 nm is selective for fluorescence. NMR data indicate that fluorescein was coupled to ti~e tyramine residue of LMW heparin. The third product was a heparin-biotin conjugate which was purified using avidin-sepharose. The purified compound had an anticoagulant activity of 66 aXa U/mg and 21 alia U/rag. Heparin-biotin was visualized by interaction with streptavidin alkaline phosphate conjugate and indirect colorimetric detection. A competitive binding assay is evaluated with this new products. Labeled heparins can be employed for competitive binding assays, single-cell analysis, flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy and other related techniques. We describe the production of anti heparin monoclonal antibodies (MAb) using a series of techniques for coupling of low molecular weight heparin to bovine serum albumin (BSA). A conjugate prepared by reductive amination successfully induced the production of MAb in Balb C-mice. The anticoagulant activity ofLMW heparin BSA conjugate was demonstrated in the heptest coagulation assay. The MAb was purified by a protein A/G-and LMW-heparin agarose affinity chromatography. Gel electrophoresis with appropriate standards revealed an antibody of the IgGl-subclass. The specificity of the antibody was analyzed by defined heparin preparations and heparin like compounds using a competitive double antibody radioimmunoassays (RIA). 125-iodine labeled tyramine-LMW heparin served as antibody-antigen-complex indicator. The minimal heparin binding lengths of the MAb is a decasaccharide. The MAb has a high affinity to unfractionated and high affinity heparins, different affinities to LMW heparins, and low affinities to oligosaccharides, low affinity heparin, heparin with low sulphate content and heparin like compounds (1/100 to 1/1000 less sensitive). Native heparin is detected at concentrations of 100 ng/ml. Antithrombin III inhibits the binding of the MAb to the tracer indicating comparable afirmity of the MAb to heparin as antithrombin m. Improved pharmacological properties of heparin preparations may be obtained by different techniques. The aim of the investigations was to find out whether covalent attachment of heparin to albumin or IgG prolongs the anticoagulant effects. Low molecular weight heparin was coupled to the proteins by reductive amination. The binding was demonstrated by NMR spectra. Gel electrophoresis data indicate that more than 1 heparin molecule bound to the proteins. The antifactor Xa and antifactor IIa activities of the albumin heparin are 30 aXa U/mg and 17 alIa U/mg calculated for a molecular weight of 60.000 D for albumin, and 24 aXa U/mg and 14 alIa U/mg for IgG (Mw 100.000 D). Mw of the heparin preparation was 6000 D, with aXa and alia activities of 108 aXa U and 50 AT U/mg. From these data it is calculated that 4-5 heparin molecules were bound per albumin or IgG molecule. Unfractionated heparin, the parent LMW heparin and the LMW heparin-protein conjugates were injected intravenously into 8 rats each. Serial blood samples were obtained over a period of 6 hrs to determine the biological activities. After intravenous injection of 100 aXa U/kg bw the aXa activity (determined by $2222 chromogenic substrate assay) remained unchanged for both protein-heparins in comparison with the parent LMW-heparin. The half-live of antifactor 11 a activity (determined by the $2238 chromogenic subsa'ate assay) was significantly increased from 60 to 120 min in comparison with unfractionated heparin. The present data show that protein-heparin-complexes a prolonged pharmacodynamic half-life concerning antifactor IIa activity. It is supposed that the heparin-protein conjugates are recognized and handled as macroheparins by the heparin receptors in plasma and on cells resulting in an increased specific inhibition of thrombin. Recently we demonstrated that the antibody involved in HAT is not heparin specific as heparin can be substituted by different sulfated oligosaccharides (SO) (Thromb. Haemost. igg2; . To investigate whether direct SO binding to platelets is essential for the pathomechanism of HAT we performed inhibition studies using 3Hheparin (0,007 mg/ml) and SO (0,7 mg/ml) with a different homology to heparin. High grade SO reduced 3H-heparin binding to platelets: i.e. heparin (82%) dextransulfate (95%) and pentosan polysulfate (96%), while the effect of the LMW heparins Kabi 2165 (65%), enoxaparin (60%) and CY 216 (30%) was less. Low grade SO, i. e. de-N-sulfated hepsrin had no such effect. Only those SO which interfered with the heparin binding to plstelets activated platelets in the presence of the antibody. Platelets preincubated with HAT sere and washed were not activated by subsequent incubation with heparin. Reversely, platelets first preincubated with high grade SO (which interfered with 3H-heparin binding) and then washed were activated when HAT sere were added. We conclude, that binding of SO to platelets depends on their grade of sulfation but not on their primary structure. As the antibody in HAT depends on the presence of high grade SO on the pletelet surface, only low grade SO should be used for further parenteral enticosgulation in patients with HAT. * We report on a new method for labeling low molecular weight heparins with 131Iodine by binding tyramine to the anhydromannose end of the molecules. The anti Factor Xa activity was 110U/ml. The pharmacokinetics of the compound was examined after i.v. injection of 13q-tyramineheparin into Wistar rats. About 18% of the activity was found in the liver, whereas 33% was detected in urine. Since evidence from cell culture experiments implies that reticuloendothelial cell system receptors might be involved in heparin metabolism, maleylated bovine serum albumin, a substance known to block scavenger receptors, was injected prior to the radiolabelled heparin compound. The liver uptake was reduced from 17.4% to 4.8%. Injection of unfractionated heparin before tracer application caused a considerable increase in urine excretion (33% versus 53%) of the tracer substance. Thus the liver uptake of heparins is linked to scavenger receptor mediated mechanisms in vivo. The interaction of counterionic polyelectrolytes with high linear surface charge density in salt solution causes a displacement of condensed counterions. The increase of entropy of this reaction is supposed to be the driving force for the interaction. Such a molecular process could also be relevant for the interaction between thrombin and beparin. We investigated therefore the interaction of synthetic polyelectrolytes in the presence of calcium as condensing counterion and compared the data with analogous experiments with heparin and thrombin.",

In this pH range the binding of calcium to heparin increases proportionally with pH. In contrast, calcium binds only minimally to heparin at pH 3. It also binds only minimally to polyvinylsulfate (PVS) at any pH. At pH 7.4 thrombin has 7 positive surface charges (Heuck CC, et ai.: J Biol Chem 260: 4598, (1985) .

            "text": "Since Calcium shows different binding affinities for PAA and PVS, and calcium binding affinity to heparin increases proportionally with the number of carboxylate residues in beparin, it may be concluded that calcium binds predominantly to the carboxylate residues in heparin. The electrostatic interaction between thrombin and heparin leads to the dissociation of counterions bound to the anionic matrix. This observation supports the hypothesis that the binding between thrombin and heparin is governed by an increase in entropy I. Calin (Biopharm, Charleston, USA) -a calcium dependent protein, extracted from the saliva of the medicinal leech (hirudo medicinalis) possesses a collagenase like activity and inhibits platelet adhesion to collagen. We have tested the influence of calin on different platelet functions: platelet adhesion to siliconised glass, platelet induced aggregation, platelet induced thrombin generation time (PITT) and platelet spreading. We have also investigated the effect of calin in vivo on laser induced thrombus formation in the microcirculation of the rat mesenterium. In final concentrations ranging from 25 U/ml to 200 U/ml calla showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on platelet adhesion to siliconised glass and on PITT. Platelet aggregation induced by collagen, ADP and epinephrine was strongly inhibited in a dose dependent manner in citrate-PRP (final concentrations of calla of 500-2500 U/ml}. Ristocetin and arachidonic acid induced aggregation were only slightly inhibited at very high concentrations of calm (2500 U/ml). Platelet rich plasma obtained from blood anticoagulated with hirudin in comparison with citrate PRP was not sensitive to epinephrine as an inducer of aggregation. Calm also inhibited the laser-induced thrombus formation in rat mesenteral vane, however in a very small dose range with a marked antithrombotic effects at a 100 U/kg. Calla is an interesting inhibitor of platelet functions. Further investigations are necesscary to clarify the different inhibitory effective concentrations in in vivo and in vitro tests.",

            "text": "The stimulation of neutrophils (PMNL) by activated platelets essentially dependens on mural contacts between both cell types. The intercellular signalling seems to be mediated by the the PMNL integrin CDllc/CD18 which interacts with fibrinogen exposed on activated platelets (Raf et al., Blood 80: 1238 , 1992 Ruf and Patscheke, Hematology 64:A7, 1992) . Cytochalasin D inhibits the activation of PMNL stimulated with antibodies that erosslink CDllc/CD18 ( Barton et al., .] .Cell Biol. 116:1007 Biol. 116: ,1992 . Therefore it may be hypothesized that polymerisatioa of actin is involved in the activation generated via CDllc/CD18 on PMNL. It was the aim of this study to investigate whether formation of actin fibers is also required for the platelet induced activation of PMNL. The luminol enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) as a parameter of PMNL activation was measured simultaneously to the platelet aggregation in mixed suspcasions of piatelets (2 x 10~/ml) and PMNL (2 x 106/ml). Matal adhesion of both cell types was determined microscopically using the rosette formation assay described by Jungi et al. (Blood 67:629, 1986) . Cytochalasin D inhibited the CL of PMNL induced by thrombin activated platelets. The IC50 of cytochalasin D was 0.44 panol/l. At 2.5 ~.mol/l, cytoehalasin D totally blocked the C1 of PMNL, although no effect on platelet aggregation was detected. When even 20 pmol/l of cytochalasin D were used, platelet aggregation was slightly inhibited whereas the adhesion of PMNL to thrombin-activated platelets Was still unchanged. Control experiments with PMNL suspensions showed that cytochalasin D does not inhibit but strongly enhances (20 ixmol/l) the PMNL activation by FMLP or PAF. These data indicate that the triggering mechanism of PMNL activation by adhering platelets is dependent on the aetin treadmill. ( Adhesion of platelets to leukocytes occurs in vivo. It has been reported recently that circulating platelet-leukoeyte conjugates are increased in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (Rinder et al., Blood 79, 1201 -1205 ). We investigate the adhesion of platelets to leukocytes in vitro (rosette formation assay) and we have shown recently that the rosetting is a complex event including the participation of the receptors CD62 and CD41a on the platelet surface membrane (Ann. Hematol. 64, A9 (1992) ). Activation of CD41a on platelets is associated with binding of fibrinogen to this receptor. Therefore, we investigated the role of fibrinogen on the adhesion of platelets to leukocytes. Thrombin-stimulated and fixed platelets stirred in an aggregometer did not show any response after addition of fibrinogen. However, ADP-stimulated and fixed platelets responded to fibrinogen in a concentration-dependent manner by a fall in the light absorbance. This fibrinogen effect is inhibited completely by pretreatment of platelets with RGDS. Unstimulated and fixed platelets responded even to high dosages of fibrinogen only weakly. In parallel, the rosetting of ADP-stimulated platelets was significantly enhanced by the addition of fibrinogen, whereas no significant influence of fibrinogen on the basal rosetting of unstimulated platelets was observed. The anti CD61 monoclonal antibody D3GP3 induces platelet aggregation by exposure of fibrinogen binding sites. Incubation of unstimulated platelets wkh this antibody in the presence of fibrinogen resulted in a significant formation of rosettes between platelets and leukocytes. In the absence of fibrinogen D3GP3 had no effect on the resetting, the specificity of D3GP3 has been proved by using an unspecific IgG. Rosetting of ADP-stimulated platelets to leukocytes which were stimulated with ADP and fibrinogen was significantly enhanced in comparison to the resetting of ADP-stimulated platelets to unstimulated leukocytes. Stimulation of leukocytes with ADP in the presence of fibrinogen was associated with fibrinogen binding to its surface. Fibrinogen acts as a bridging molecule between platelets and leukocytes. The receptor on the platelet surface is CD41a, the counter receptor on leukocytes might be CD11b/CD18 or the leukocyte response integrin (LRI). Normal platelet aggregation requires a series of cellular events, including (i) agonist-induced activation of the GPIIb-IIla complex, resulting in a functional receptor, (ii) binding of fibrinogen orvon Willebrand factor to GPIIb-Illa, and (iii) postoccupancy processes after ligand binding. To classify disorders of platelet aggregation in terms of this series of events, we have used flow cytometry and conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies that can distinguish between resting, activated, and/igand-occupiedforms of GPIIb-Illa. PAC1 (Dr. S.J. Shattil, Philadelphia, PA) specifically recognizes the activated GPIIb-Illa complex; anti-LIBS1 (Dr. M.H. Ginsberg, La Jolla, CA) selectively reacts with a ligand-induced binding site on GPIIla. This epitope is expressed upon receptor occupancy by fibrinogen (a process which requires platelet activation), or by fibrinogenmimetic RGD peptides (which bind to GPIIb-Illa in an activation-independent manner). Thus, flow cytometric quantitation of binding of PAC1 and anti-LIBS1 to platelsts stimulated by agonists or incubated with RGD peptides offers a strategy to distinguish between detects in activation, ligand binding, or postoccupancy events. Using this approach, platelet samples from 30 patients with myelopreliferative disorders (MDP) and from 6 platelet concentrates (PC) stored under blood bank conditions were studied. All platelet samples were shown to have aggregation defects in response to epinephrine (EPI) or ADP despite normal or near normal expression of GPIIb-Illa, as evaluated by intact binding of LJ-P4 (Dr. Z.M. Ruggeri, La Jolla, CA), an antibody specific for the GPIIb-Illa complex on resting or activated platelets. Upon platelet stimulation with EPI or ADP, 25 of the 30 MPD patients failed to bind PACt Furthermore, binding of anti-LIBS1 was concomitantly reduced or absent following pletalet stimulation with EPI or ADP, or incubation with GRGDSP. Four patients with defective aggregation showed intact binding of PAC1 and anti-LIBS1 in response to EPI or APP. Platelsts from PC stored for 7 days failed to react with PAC1 and anti-LIBS1 in response to ADP or EPI, but showed increased binding of anti-LIBS1 upon incubation with GRGDSP. These results indicate that platelet dysfunction in MPD can be caused by a defect either in activation of GPIIb-Illa, or its ligand binding function, or a combination of both. Moreover, 4 MPD patients with the postoccupancy dysfunction phenotype were identified. In contrast to abnormal aggregation in MPD, platelet storage lesions appear to be related to an intrinsic defect of agonist-mediated activation of the GPIIb-Illa complex rather than to a defect in its ligand binding function. EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenla (PTP) is a phenomenon in which anti-platelet antibodies react with platelets in the presence of EDTA leading to platelet agglutination and consequent underestimation of platelet counts by electronic counting machines. Although the phenomenon is not rare and is of clinical importance little is known about the mechanism of the EDTAdependent platelet agglutination in PTP. In or~leP to elucidate this mechan sm in more.detail we investigated the expression of platelet integrins and activation antigens on platelets of patients with 3nticodgulant-induced PTP (n = 8) and in healthy controls without PTP(n = 6). Blood was anticoagulated with either EDTA (6.5 mM) or hirudin (50 pg/ml). Expression of GP Ib, GP la/lla, GPIIb/llla, CD36, CD62, CD63 and thrombospondin (TSP) on platelets was measured by flowcytometrie (FACSCAN) 5, 100 and 360 minutes after blood sampling. The results are expressed as mean percentage of platalets expressing the respective antigen: It is widely described that platelets from people suffering from acute myocardial infarction (MCI) and angina (AA) show hyperaggregability. Deviding total platelet population into three dens~ dependent subfractions (1.04 g/ml <SP I< 1.065 g/ml <SP I1< 1.07 g/ml <SP II1< 1.08 g/ml) we could find a significant increase of SP I from 24.6 -+ 5.2 % in control to 33.3 -+ 13.4 % in MCI and 31.8 -+ 11.2 % in AA patients, respectively. The three subfractions showed biochemical and functional differences in terms of second messenger metabolism, in thromboxane A 2 release, and in aggregation if low concentrations of aggregation inducing agents were used. SP I appears to be the most sensitive population compared to SP II and SP III. Even though SP I exhibits the lowest 5-HT content and 5-HT uptake, the release reaction was more sensitive in this fraction as compared to SP II and SP II1. Further, SP I represents the population with the lowest granula content as investigated by electron microscopy. Therefore SP I seems to be a preactivated platelet population resulting in a higher senmtivity to szimulat~on, in order to determine the status of activation in platelat subfractions FACS analyses of the granula specific protein GP53 at the platelat surface were performed. SP I exhibited a higher ratio positiqe to negative fluorescent cells compared to SP II and SP III basal and after stimulation with thrombin. The results clearly show a higher status of preactivation in subfraction SP I. We studied MHC class I and II molecules associated with cAITP. Forty-seven patients (median age 51 years, range 20-78 years) with a disease duration of median 6 years (range 0,5 to 26 years) were phenotyped for HLA A,B,C by the standard lymphocytotoxicity test, HLA DR and DQ by restriction fragment length polymorphism and DP by oligonucleotide typing. Antiplatelet antibodies directed against glycoprotein Ib/IX and lib/Ilia were determined by monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of platelet a~tigens (MAIPA). Patients were divided into those with antibodies (n=17) and those without detectable antibodies (n=30). Comparison of antigen frequencies of the whole group of patients with healthy controls revealed no significant difference for any of the MHC class I or II antigens. There was also no difference of the HLA class I antigens if either patients with detectable antibodies or those without antibodies were compared \"with the control population. However, an increased frequency of HLA DQI31A was found among patients with detectable antibodies. This increased frequency of HLA DQI31A was also significant if compared with patients without antibodies. These results indicate that in subgroups of patients with cAITP immune response genes could be defined by improved typing for MHC class II molecules. Several in vitro studies have revealed that plasma lipoproteins can modulate the reactivity of isolated human blood plazelets.

INCREASED PLATELET ADHESION AND SHORTENED PLATELET-INDUCED THROMBIN GENERATION TIME (PITT) POSSIBLE INDI-CATORS OF AN ENHANCED RISK OF THROMBOSIS IN PATIENTS  AFTER GENERAL SURGERY WITH AND WITHOUT HEPARIN  PROPHYLAXIS AND IN PATIENTS AFTER ELECTIVE HIP SURGERY  UNDER HEPARIN Investigations on platelet adhesion before and after operations have rarely been performed. A newly developed global test system \"platelet-induced thrombin generation time\" (PITT) in which aggregation and clotting depend on the adhesion and activation of platelets at the wall of the measuring cuvette is shortened in patients with acute thrombotic venous or arterial occlusions. Platalet adhesion to siliconized glass and PITT have been investigated preoperatively, intraoperatively and on different postoperative days 30 patients undergoing general surgery (usually strumectomy) who did not receive heparin prophylaxis, in 56 patients with general surgery receiving heparin or low molecular weight heparins and in 60 patients with elective hip replacement who received unfractionated heparin with two different dose regimens. In patients operated without heparin prophylaxis platelet adhesion was significantly increased and PITT parameters were significantly shortened compared with the preoperation values. In contrast platelet adhesion and PITT parameters remained practically unchanged in the group which received heparin prophylaxis. In the 60 patients who have been investigated before and after hip replacement the mean PITT parameters were markedly prolonged and adhesion was increased on the first postoperative day. However in 25 % of these patients adhesion remained very high and PITT parameters were markedly shorter than normal or than preoperative values in spite of adequate heparinization. Shortened PITT end increased platelet adhesion may be predictors of postoperative thrombosis. In a prospective trial it will be studied whether increased platelet adhesion or shortened PITT parameters on the first postoperative day are indicators of postoperative thromboses.

            "text": "NMR spectroscopy was also used for analysis of GAGs in urines, either directly on dialysed samples, or on gelchromatographic fractions. Heparin-like substances were detected in urines of both untreated and GAG-treated volunteers, with significantly higher levels in these latter than in basal samples. A preliminary characterization is also being made in GAG extracts from human plasma. Glycosaminoglycans have been specifically labeled by endpoint al~tachment of tyramine and fluoresceio-5-isothiocyanate (FITC) to. the anhydromannosyl group of low molecular mass heparin (LMMH) to analyze the pharmacokinetics ano metabolism. The product was labeled with 125 or 131 iodine at the aryl residue of tyramine. The relevance of the specific binding has been demonstrated 1) by developing a competitive binding assay with labeled LMMH and 2) by pharmaco-kinetic studies in animals, which gave insight into the organ distribution, liver and renal metabolism. Proteins have been synthesized to the anhydromannosyl group of LMMH to improve the pharmacokinetics and to use albumin as carrier protein to induce antibody production in mice. The modiclfication succeeded in 1) a prolonged anticoagulant effect of LMMHin animals and 2) in the production of specific monoclonal IgG1 antiheparin, antibodies. Modifiedlipophilic unfractionated heparins (UFH) and LMMH are currently developed to improve the pharmacological properties. UFH or LMMH were substituted to organic residues like tyramine, acyl-groups, cholesterol-hemisuccinare, and aryl groups, i.e. benzo~,l. The resultin~ products were 1) fuIly anticoagulantly active in vitro and 2) revealed a pro!onged in vivo half life in animal studies. LMMHtyramme was labeled with FITC to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis, metabolic and receptor binding studies, Investigations and contaTol experiments demonstrated that 1) t.he pharmacokinetics (measured by HPLC) paralleled with ttae antithrombin activity ($2238 assay) and cellular binding to monocytes and lymphocytes {determined by flow cytometry) and 2) the pharmacodynamic effects on antifactor Xa activity ($2222 assay) were parallel to the binding of LMMH to granulocytes. The data suggest that 1) glycosaminoglycaes have .a complex pharmacokmetic and dynamic metabolism and 2) leucocytes may play an important role as carriers to thrombotic and inlammatory processes at intra-and extravascular sites. Until now pharmacokinetics studies on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were generally carried out evaluating biological effects (1), related to these drugs, in the biological samples or using radio-labelled compounds (2). These approaches were preferred due to the analytical problems presented by GAGs. However, Jaques (3) and Niebes (4) obtained good results also by chemical analysis of GAGs. In a previous study (5) we described a novel mass spectrometry technique enabling us to detect low concentrations of dermatan sulfate and heparin in blood or urine samples. Using this technique, we have more recently investigated the pharmacokinetics of heparin and dermatan sulfate, administered both orally and intravenously in healthy volunteers, and the plasmatic levels of these GAGs and related metabolites were determined. To improve the understanding of the pharmacokinetic of exogenous administered GAGs, in comparison with the endogenous one, deuterium labelled drugs were used. In accordance with previous data from studies with radiolabelled GAGs, the results obtained show that these molecules, in spite of the general thinking, have a good bioavaiiability. The catabolism proceed mainly by desulfation while depolymerization products were observed only in urines. These results suggest that this technique may be effective to study the pharmacokinetics of GAGs, and new studies are in progress to deepen the metabolism of these molecules and, if possible, the interaction with blood cells. Consequently, a Phase I-Study was performed in humans. Twelve healthy male volunteers received subcutaneous injections of placebo on the first day followed by ascending doses of Aprosulate in the range of 0,25 mg/kg to 2,0 mg/kg body weight on alternate days. Anticoagulant, pharmacokinetic and safety parameters were assessed for 48 hours after each injection. In addition, the activity of extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) and some parameters of fibrinolysis were determined at various time intervals. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HEPTEST R showed a dose-dependent increase for up to ten hours after each application. Bleeding time was slightly prolonged with higher doses of Aprosulate. Levels of plasminogen, antiplasmin and plasmin-alpha-2-anti-plasmin (PAP) were not significantly effected when compared with the individual prevalues of each study day. Only the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) was significantly decreased four and ten hours after administration of higher doses of Aprosulate. EPI-activity showed a dose-dependent increase. In general, Aprosulate was well tolerated.",

Suppression of the synthesis/release of endothelin from the vascularwall (clinical: decreased plasma endothelin levels as measured by an RIA method). b.

In order to prolong the life span of implanted grafts endothelialization of grafts before implantation should prove useful. It has been postulated that endothelial cells from various veins and arteries show differences in their metabolic behavior. We cultured endothelial cells from jugular, saphenous, mesenteric, iliac veins and also mesenteric, splenic, iIiac and mammary arteries. For comparison, endothelial cells from human umbilical vein were also cultured. Endothelial cells in second passage were seeded on polyurethane patch (graft ,~terial). Cultured cells grown on the patch showed no differences in their morphology and the presence of factor VIII. All cells took up DiI-LDL and DiI-acetyl They also internalised and degraded 125I LDL and ~(u'I acetyl LDL. However the ratio of denradation of acety LDL to LDL varied from the localisation of vessels and arteries. No significant differences in this ratio were noted between cultures grown on patches and those without the patches. All cells were able to oxidatively modify LDL. The degree of modification was established by measuring hydroperoxides, malonaldehyde and uptake by cultured fibroblasts. Significant differences were noted in the degree of modification of LDL by ceils from various veins and arteries. No differences were noted between the same cell types cultured on the patch and without patch. From our studies it appears that polyurethane is suitable graft material for endothelialization. Endothelial cells grown on this material maintain their morphology, the presence of factor VIII, release of endothelin, take up acetyl LDL and modify lipoproteins. Studies are in progress to examine the suitability of these grafts in-vivo.",

            "text": "Dept. of Surgery, Klinikum GroBhadern, Munich SO far, several abnormalities in plasma coagulation system have been considered to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and thrombotic tendency in diabetic pat~ More recently, few studies have been addressed to the relationship between plasma hypercoagulability in a broad s~m~e and endothelial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus (DM). In ~bip regard.

Now, to clarify if this large multimeric glycoprotein, notoriously synthesized in endothelial cells, could be also modified in its structure, we recently employed the im~unoblotting technique as proposed by Ramco Lab. with Bio Red supplies (Medical Systems, Genovd) in 12 diabetJc ~tients at the onset of disease (5 females and 7 males, age 58 + 7 yrs), non-insulin reqniring, without overt signs of vasculopathy. Our results showed a significant prevalence of the largest multimeric forms of FVIII/vWF in diabetic plasma respect to normal one. This finding als~ correlated with other functional adhesive/aggregative co-proporties of FVIII/vWF as increased platelet adhesiveness (91 + 7% vs 65 + 8% in controls), presence of spontaneous platelet aggregation (38 + 9% vs O in controls) in vitro and s~gnificant fall in p[atelet aggregates ratio (W~aHoak method, 0.61 vs O.91 in controls) in vivo. Even if further study should be required to clergy whether these abnormalities are casually related or are merely secondary responses to an early vascular suffering in diabetic subjects, the immunoblotting FVIII/vWF prncedure could be used, in our opinion,as an useful non-inwasive tool to document a latent endothelial dysfunction in DM. With reperfusion of the graft liver in OLT the observed DIC-like state and the decrease in platelet aggregability have been attributed to damage of the graft liver's vascular bed due to hypoxia in the preservation time. However, no direct proof of vascular damage has been determined. Thrombomodulin (TM), a critical component of the protein C/S anticoagulant pathway, is located primarily on endothelial cell surfaces. A smaller, soluble form, cleaved by proteases from membrane bound type has been isolated from human blood and urine. This soluble TM (sTM) may be a marker of endothelial damage caused by different agents. Materials and Methods: Arterial blood samples were collected at 7 different timepoints during 23 consecutive OLTs. In addition a sample of the perfusate released from the graft was taken when the graft was floaded with the recipient's systemic blood, sTM was determined by an enzyme immuno assay (Diagnostica Stago, France). Results: Preoperative levels of sTM (median: 54 ng/ml) were more than twice as high as the values in healthy subjects (about 20 ng/ml). During the pre-anhepatic phase there was no significant change in sTM levels. During the anhepatic phase a slight but significant rise in sTM levels was observed (median at the end of the anhepatic phase: 65 ng/ml, p=0.025). This was followed by a more than twofold increase in sTM levels (median: 135 ng/ml, p=0.001) with reperfusion of the graft liver, returning to basal values in the course of hours. Accordingly samples of the perfusate of the graft liver showed very high levels of sTM (median: 216 ng/ml). Conclusion: The peak of sTM levels after reperfusion concurrently with high perfusate levels reflects a release by the graft liver which is most certainly due to endothelial damage. Involvement of the vessel wall seems to be important in severe falciparum malaria. In vitro, interaction between patient serum and cultured endothelial cells (EC) induces expression of procoagulant tissue factor. We measured Thrombomodulin (TM) plasma levels to assess involvement of the vascular endothelium in falciparum malaria in vivo. Plasma samples were obtained from 31 patients with falciparum malaria before, during and after antiparasitic therapy. TM plasma levels were determined by sandwich ELISA. -Nuclear Run-ons and Northern blots were performed to assess TM transcription in cultured EC, after they bad been incubated with patient or control serum, Before therapy, TM levels were elevated (median 45 ng/mL) in comparison to healthy controls (< 25 ng/mL). They decreased during antiparasitic therapy. Patients with complications had higher TM levels than patients with bland malaria (p < 0.05). High TM levels were associated with elevated TAT plasma levels (r = 0.30; p < 0.05), which themselves may indirectly reflect activation of the vascular endothelium. In contrast to tissue factor however, transcription of TM in cultured EC is downregulated by patient serum. These results indicate that TM plasma levels are a marker of disease severity and activity in falciparum malaria. Unlike parameters like tissue factor or TAT, however, elevated levels of TM probably do not simply reflect EC activation, but may be the result of damage to the vascular endothelium in human falciparum malaria. Recent studies have shown that endothelial cells not only can initiate and propagate the reactions of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, but might also support the activation of the intrinsic pathway by providing receptors for the proteins of the contact phase, such as Factor Xl ang high molecular weight kininogen. In the present study we evaluated the interaction between cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HLIVEC) and Factor Xll (F.XlI), the pdncipal protein in the activation of the reactions of the contact phase. Our data demonstrate that in the presence of zinc ions human purified 1-125-factor XII binds to HUVEC. The binding proportionally increases with increasing concentrations of zinc ions (10-200 pM/L), while calcium ions exert an inhibitory effect. The binding is specific, since it is inhibited by an excess (100 x) of non labeled F.XII, while it is not influenced by other proteins (fibrinogen, fibronectin, etc.). At 37~ the bir,ding does n~! ~ppear to be s.qtureb#e, p,obably due ~r~ ~r~tema!!zation of F.Xil into cells. However, at 4~ in the presence of zinc ions (50 pM/L) and calcium ions (2 raM/L) the binding is specific, reversible and saturable, at concentrations of 200-250 nM/L of F.XlI. Analysis of binding data (LIGAND program) showed the presence of a single class of endothelial cell receptors (1.02 + 0.2 x 106/ce11) with a Kd of 77 + 15 nM/L. The risults indicate that HUVEC expose specific receptors for F.Xll and may provide the physiological surface for the reactions of the contact phase.",

G.Christ*,D.Seif fert\" ,P.Hufnagl\" ,J .Wojta\" ,B.R.Binder\" PAI-1, the physiological inhibitor of both tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), is a major biosynthetic product of endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC). SMC in culture display a passage dependent increase in their PAI-1 synthesis pattern. Early passages (pass #3) secrete 230\u2022 ng/24 h PAl-1 into the conditoned media (CM) compared to 3260\u2022 ng/24 h PAl-1 secreted by late passages (pass.#7). Furthermore, cocultures of EC with early passage SMC on amniotic membranes exhibit a reduction of the overall PAl-1 secretion by about 40 %, whereas in cocultures of EC with late passage SMC an overall induction is observed. When EC-cultures were incubated with only the CM of early passage SMC, the endothelial PAI-I antigen secretion was reduced by 40-60 %. CM of late passage SMC on the other hand, slightly increased the endothelia~5PAl-1 secretion. Immunoprecipitation experiments using S-methionine metabolically labeled EC and Nothern blot analysis of EC PAI-1 mRNA indicate that the observed reduction is due to decreased PAI-1 antigen denovo synthesis and reduced PAI-1 mRNA levels, and that the observed induction is due to increased PAI-lmRNA levels. Our data suggest that aged SMC(i.e. late passage SMC) on one hand express a higher PAI-I synthesis rate, and on the other hand loose the ability to downregulate the endothelial PAI-I synthesis rate, resulting in an increased procoagolatory/antifibrinolytic state. Atherosclerotic lesions are, at least partially, caused by intimaproliferation through dividing and proliferating SMC. To speculate, we would suggest that such \"late passage\" SMC contribute to the pathophysiology of thrombotic complications often occurring within atheroselerosis, through reducing the fibrinolytic potential of the vessel wall leading to a higher procoagulatory state, thus building a bridge between atheresclerosis and thrombosis. Adhesion molecules on endothelial cells are important for a variety of biological processes such as extravasation of leukocytes (inflammatory reactions) and adherence of malignant cells (invasiveness and metastasis formation). In the present study we investigated the influence of cytokines on endothelial adhesion molecules. The adhesion molecules ICAM-1 (CD54) and PECAM (CD31) are spontaneously expressed on HUVEC as demonstrated by immunhistochemistry using specific monoelonal antibodies In order to quantify adhesion molecule expression on cultured unfixed HUVEC, a radioimmunometric assay using MoAb (CD54, CD31, ELAM-1) and j125-second antibody has been established. An upregulation of ICAM-1 and PECAM and an induction of ELAM-1 expression could be induced by addition and/or preincubation of HUVEC with the cytokines IL-1 and TNF-c~. Additionally Poly I:C, Pentoxifyllin and Cyclosporin were able to induce ELAM-1 expression, whereas Dexamethason had no effect. From our study we conclude that proinflammatory cytokines and certain therapeutic agents are able to activate endothelial cells as demonstrated by expression of adhesion molecules. Leukocyte adhesion, rolling and transmigration through the endothelial monolayer at sites of tissue inflammation are central events in the pathogenesis rheumatic disease. The pyrogens IL-lc~, TNFcL, and bacterial LPS increase endothelial cell (EC) adhesiveness and transmigration for leukocytes by stimulating surface expression of the cell adhesion molecules (CAM) ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.",

Similar results were obtained when the pyrogens TNF~ or bacterial LPS were used in combination with ibuprofen. We propose that these effects of ibuprofen on EC-CAM surface expression contributes to its antiinflammatory effect. In 1989, a Federation of specialized Centers for the Survey of oral Anticoagulant therapy (FCSA) was instituted in Italy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the management of patients in one of these Centers reduces the incidence of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications, in comparison with the pre-enrolment rate. The incidence of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in a cohort of 271 consecutive unseleeted patients (M/F 130/141; median age 52, range 12-75 ys.), on lifelong oral anticoagulation (OA) (IT INR 3-4.5) for cardiac prosthetic valve replacement (mitral 132, aortic: 105, mitroaortic: 34) was evaluated before and after the enrolment in our anticoagulation Center. Before the enrolment the OA was selfadministered or prescribed by the general practitioner and 35 letS. (12.9%), with a median follow-up of 30 months (range 1-216), experienced 45 thromboembolic episodes (TIA 24, stroke 16, arterial peripheral embolism 3, myocardial infarction 2) with an incidence of 6.6% pts-yr. Other 33 pts. (12.2%) had 33 major bleeding events (requiring hospitalization or transfusions) with an incidence of 4.9% pts-yr. From May 1987, the same patients are followed as outpatients an our antieoagulation Center with a new computer program for the management of OA therapy. After a similar median follow up of 34 months (range 1-43), 4 pts. (1.5%) had 4 thromboembolic complications ('I1A 1, stroke 2, peripheral medal embolism 1) with an incidence of 0.6% pts-yr (p<0.001 for comparison with the preenrolment incidence) and 7 pts. (2.6%) showed 7 major bleeding episodes with an incidence of 1% pts-yr (p<0.001). Our data indicate that specialized Centers for the management of OA supported by computer assistance significantly improve the quality of care. BY When the coagulation system is activated, the cleavage of prothrombin into thrombin and the activation peptide F1 +2 represents the key reaction tbr fibrin generation. Prothrombin activation peptide F1 +2 was determined by an enzyme immunoassay based on the sandwich principle as described by Peher (1991) . Compared to healthy controls (median 0.73 nM/l FI +2; n=47) patients under oral anticoagulant therapy (n= 164) showed significantly reduced F1 +2 levels (p < 0.0005). With an increasing degree of anticoagulation, reflected by increasing INR (international normalized ratio), F1 +2 levels declined. When the prothrombin time was within the therapeutic range (INR>2.0), the majority of samples showed FI+2 concentrations below the reference level. F1 +2 levels were also decreased by low dose coumarin (INR < 2.0) which could not be controlled by thromboplastin time. 9 of 15 patients showed on day 1 and/or day 2 of therapy a transient but pronounced hypercoagulable phase (FI +2 elevated). F1 +2 levels 6 days after introduction of therapy are still within the reference range (median 0.57 nM FI +2), whereas in the stable phase of oral anticoagulation F1 +2 levels are reduced below the reference range (median 0.37 nM F1 +2 for INR 2.0 -3.0). From our data it is evident that an individual monitoring of oral anticoagulation is possible by measurement of prothrombin fragment F1 +2.

Heparin assays share some limitations, most commonly low sensitivity and low analytical power at low heparin concentrations. We set up an assay to detect unfractionated heparin (UF) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in plasma at low concentrations. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of the new assay in vitro and its ability to detect low concentrations of heparin ex vivo. The assay evaluates the thrombin neutralizing activity of plasma by measurement of thrombinantithrombin III (TAT) generated after addition of thrombin (PTNA). Human thrombin (2 nM, final concentration) was added to human plasma anticoagulated with 3.8% sodium citrated containing UF and a LMWH (Enoxaparine) at concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 2.0 anti-Xa U/ml or saline. The reaction was blocked after 15 seconds by an excess of hirudin and TAT evaluated by Elisa (Enzygnost TAT, Behring). Thrombin concentration and the incubation period were selected after extensive evaluation (range of thrombin 1 to 6 nM, incubation time 15 to i80 seconds). Addition of UH and Enoxaia~t~ine to human plasma resulted in a dose dependent increase of generated TAT. PTNA was sensitive to heparin concentrations as low as 0.025 anti-Xa U/ml and showed a high analytical power at heparin concentration ranging between 0.025 to 0.5 anti-Xa U/ml (r=-0.98). Heparin concentrations higher than 0.5 anti-Xa U/ml gave maximal TAT generation. The sensitivity of PTNA to plasma heparin ex vivo was studied in 6 healthy volunteers injected subcutaneously with 5.000 U of UF or saline. Samples were taken at time 0 and then 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 hours after the injections. No changes in aPTT, anti-Xa and anti-lla (chromogenic) were observed in any of the two groups. The results of I:rI'NA (pM TAT) are shown in the The results demonstrate dynamic changes of the fibrinolytic system. However, the relative stability of t-PA and PAI activity in poor-and nonresponder suggest a long-lasting endothelial dysfunction.",

Fibrinopeptide A (FPA) is a specific marker of thrombin activity and can be considered as an index of formation of fibrin from which different degradation products derive after lysis by plasmin. An increased thrombin formation was reported in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), but no relation was observed between FPA plasma levels and the extent of coronary vessel damage, while differences were observed in relation to the activity of IHD. Controversial data were reported on the contrary on products of plasmin activity in patients with IHD. Aim of this study was to investigate the degree of plasmin activity with respect to increased thrombin generation by evaluating plasma levels of FPA (ELISA, Boehringer Mannheim Italia, -BMI -, Milan, Italy) in comparison to those of D-dimer, product of plasmin action on cross-linked fibrin (D-D, ELISA, BMI, Milan , Italy) in 10 patients with unstable angina pectoris (group U), in 10 patients with effort stable angina (group S) and in 10 controls (group C) of equivalent age.

FPA/D-D molar ratio was much higher (p<0.001) in group U than in group S and C ( U = 3.19; S = 1.92; C= 1.23). These results indicate that in patients with IHD an activation of both blood coagulation and fibrinolysis exists. However, in patients with unstable angina, the markedly enhanced thrombin generation is not paralleled by a similar plasmin activity as assessed by levels of D-D.",

            "text": "Variables of haemostatic and fibdnolytic system were tested in 55 patients with pedpheral arteriosclerotic disease (group/%,), in 50 patients with venous thrombosis (group 13) and in 50 age-corresponding healthy volunteers. No significant reduction of antithrombin III, protein C (antigen end activity) as well as protein S (whole and free antigen) was obtained in both patient groups in comparison to the controls. 9 patients showed a reduced activity of factor Xll. The fibdnogen concentration was significantly higher in patients of group A than in patients of group B and controls. The euglobulin fibdnolytic activity (EFA) before venous occlusion was significantly lower in patients of group A than in patients of group B as well as control group. After venous occlusion the EFA was significantly lower in both patient groups, the lowest activity showed patients of group A. Tissue type activator (t-PA) antigen and v Willebrend factor antigen were significantly higher in both patient groups, the highest concentrations of both proteins were measured in plasma samples of group A. The activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAl) was higher in both patient groups in compadson to the controls. The high PAl activity was the main cause of the low EFA in the patients. High fibdnogen concentration, v Willebrand factor antigen, t-PA antigen and PAl activity in connection with reduced fibdnolytic capacity prove to be indicators for an increased thrombotic dsk in patients with pedpheral artedoscleretic disease. A reduced flbdnolytie capacity caused by an high level of PAl was the frequent result in patients with venous thrombosis. Hyperinsulinemia due to decreased insulin sensitivity has been shown to be one of the risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) in pts. with obesety, hypertension and glucose intolerance. Another important risk factor in CAD is an elevation of PAl-1 plasma levels which are suggested to correlate with insulin levels. We investigated the effect of doxazosin (D), a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking agent, which has been shown to decrease glucose-stimulated insulin plasma levels, on PAl-1 plasma levels. We determined in 12 moderately obese male pts with glucoseinducable hyperinsulinemia plasma levels of insulin, PAl-1 and t-PA (both activity and antigen) at basal conditions and during intravenous glucose tolerance test (GTT). GTT's were performed before (A) and after D-treatment with 2mgs/d (B) and 4mgs/d (C)6 weeks each. Basal insulin plasma levels before and after treatment were not significantly different (A: 15+2; B: 12+_2; C: 14+1; mlE/I, x_+SE.). Insulin peak levels as determined 10 minutes after glucose load decreased significantly with respect to duration of therapy and increasing dosage of D (A: 62+20; B: 44+9; C: 27_+8; p<0.01). Mean PAl-1 activity and \"active\" antigen levels at basal conditions were not significantly different at the time points of investigation. Furthermore, both parameters were not significantly altered by GTT. PAl-1 total antigen basal plasma levels, however, exhibited a nonsignificant continuous increase during D-therapy (A: 84_+21; B: 96+9; C: 126+35; ng/ml, x-+SE.), t-PA antigen and activity levels remained unchanged with respect to GTT's and D-therapy. No significant correlations between insulin and PAl-1 or t-PA levels could be demonstrated. From these data it is concluded, that D or GTT +/-D-pretreatment have no direct or indirect effects on plasma levels of the main fibrinolytic parameters in the selected group of CAD pts. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) plays a role in many disorders of endothelium, not only in yon Willebrand's disease. Like t-PA, it is synthesized in endothelium. The release can be measured by the venous ecelusion test (VO), which is widely used to determine the release of t-PA from endothelium in patients with thrombophilia.",

            "text": "Our results may suggest a combined endothelial disorder of t-PA-Ag and vWF:Ag in young patients with thrombosis and reduced release of t-PA. It has been suggested that diabetes mellitus (DM) can be associated with hypercoagulability, which related to the development of vascular complications and fibrin deposition in the vasculature. With regard to the fibrinolytic activity, few studies have been addressed but conflicting results have been reported owing to the wide variability and poor specificity of various parameters used to asses the fibrinolytic status in DM. TO better clarify the fibrinolytic ~_ tial in type ]I DM we studied before and after 20 min venous occlusion [~OT) the behaviour of tissue-type plasminogen actl vator (t-P~ , plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) ,PAI-I and PAI-2, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) plasma activities. 21 diabetic patients (9 females and 12 males, age 38-59), all in glycometabolic compensation (HbA1-c49.9%) and without overt signs of vasculopathy were investigated. 10 normal individuals were the control group. In all subjects we determined: t-PA (Immulyse t-PA) , PAI-1 antigen (Tint Elize PAI-I) , PAI-2 antigen ~in Elize PAI-2) and u-PA (Chromolize u-PA) all purchased from Biopool AB-Menarini, Florence. As index of fibrinolytic potential we also used t-PA/PAI-I x 10 ratio. Our results showed reduced fibrinolytic activities in basal conditions in all of diabetics as documented by the lowest values of t-PA (3.52 + 1.1 ng/ml vs 5.1 + 2.2 in c~r/czols) and u-PA (0.22 + 0.06 ng/ml-vs 0.37 + 0.08 ng/m-l) with an increase of PAI-I (I-9.7 + 2.3 ng/ml vs 12-+ 1.9 ng/ml) and PAI-2 (18.7 + 4.3 ng/ml vs-10 ng/ml) . After-VOT no modification of these parameters was seen in diabetics. In the control group as expected we observed after VOT a significant increase of t-PA (15.8 + 3.9 ng/ml) , a slight increase of u-PA (0.59 + 0.07 ng/ml} , no change of PAI-I (13.2 +_ 3.6 ng/ml)and PAI-2 110 ng/ /ml) with a significant (p~0.001) elevation of t-PA/PAI-I ratio. Our data confirm a marked reduction of fibrinolytic potential in DM both in basal conditions and after VOT. ~he ELISA t-PA, PAI-I and PAI-2 determinations jointly with the i,~munoadsorhance method i Immunological Specificity and Accuracy control (ISAC)' are the most reliable and non-invasive tools to ~erstand the regulatozy med~mlisms of flhrlnolysis Jn DM. We evaluated the accuracy of Compression Real Time B-Mode Ultrasonography (CUS) in the early diagnosis of proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DV'r) in elective hip replacement patients, with venography as gold standard. The only criteria for DVT were the compressibility of common femoral vein (two sites), superficial femoral vein (all length) and popliteal vein (three sites). The prospective study was started in September, 1991 on all consecutive patients admitted for total elective hip surgery until August, 1992. A total of 100 patients, of the 104 included, terminated the study (M:43, F:57). Patients underwent CUS (Aloka SSD 500 portable Echo) and bilateral ascending veaography on 10-+ 1 postoperative day. An additional serial examination was performed on 5-+1 postoperative day. Venographies were performed by radiologists unaware of CUS results. Adequate CUS versus venography was obtained in 191 limbs. A positive venography for proximal Dv'r was obtained in 27/100 patients (27.0%). One patient had bilateral proximal DVT. All patients were asymptomatic. The sensitivity and specificity for CUS for proximal DVT (considered per limb) were 64.2% (18/28, 95% C.I. 45-84) and 98.7~ (161/163, 95% C.I. g5-100), respectively; the positive and negative predictive value were 90.0% (18/20, 95% C.I. 67-98) and 94.1% (161/171, 95% C.L 89-97), respectively. 10 patients with negative CUS had a positive venography for proximal disease (5 in the distal portion of the popliteal vein, 4 in the common femoral vein, and 1 in the superficial femoral vein). Two patients had a positive CUS and negative venography (common femoral vein). 7 proximal Dv'r (25%) were detected in fifth postoperative day, with serial CUS. Our study demonstrates that CUS is an useful non invasive test for the detection of DVT in asymptomatic patients. If all thrombi are considered, the technique shows relatively low sensitivity, for the difficulty in the diagnosis of little non occlusive thrombi, whose cliniCal relevance has not yet been established. With the serial testing is possible to make early diagnosis in 1/4 of the affected patients, to begin therapy earlier, to lower pulmonary embolism rate, and to reduce costs. Markers of haemostatic system activation, such as D-Dimer and thrombin antithrombin III complexes (TAT), has been reported as useful noninvasive diagnostic tools in clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). For D-Dimer there has been suggested a sensitivity of about i00 % in DVT. Thus, negative results in D-Dimer or TAT tests should allow to exclude DVT. In order of ~his, we studied the predictive value of D-Dimer and TAT in consecutive 77 patients with suspected DVT at adtaission. The diagnosis DVT was confirmed or excluded by ascending phlebography as golden standard. In the DVT positive group (58/77), D-Dimer was elevated in 86% (50/58), TAT in 83% (48/58). In all of the DVT negative group (19/77), D-Dimer was within the normal range, while TAT was taarkly increased in 26% (5/19). About this results, we conclude, that normal D-Dimer or TAT results in symptomatic patients allows not to exclude DVT certainly. Nevertheless, additional diagnostic taethodes as duplex scan or phlebography are necessary for precise diagnosis. In a retrospective study we identified from the computer files of the Hospitals in the province of Parma and of our Centre for Haemustatic Diseases all women 15-44 years old who were resident in the province of Parma and who had Venous Thromboembolism (VT, including deep venous thrombosis of the limbs, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis of the meningeal veins), Cerebral Ischemia and Stroke (CI/S), and acute Myocardial Infarction (/vll) from 1989 through 1991. Incorrect diagnosis, use of Oral Contraceptives (OC) and other risk factors were assessed by reviewing the medical records and by direct or telephone interviews. The denominators, i.e. the number of woman/years on OC and without OC were calculated through the number of preparations of OC sold in the province during the corresponding years and from the computer files of the National Health System, 22 cases of VT were identified, all diagnosed by instrumental methods, of whom 13 (59%) occurred in current users of OC containing _< 35 meg of oestrogen, with an incidence of 4.13 per 10,000 women-years (13/31429). The estimated incidence of VT in nonusers (inck:~ing previous users) was 0.43 per 10,000 women-years (9/210210), with a relative risk of 9.66 (95% Ch 4.14 -21.79; p <0.001). Out of the 12 cases of CI/S, of whom 9 had a positive CT or MNR scan, 5 occurred in current OC users, 5 in nonusers and 2 in previous users. The estimated incidence was 1.59 per 10,000 women-year on OC, and 0.24 per 10,000 women-year for never users. Relative risk = 6.65 (95% CI = 2.05 -21.80; p <0.01). One case of 191I was identified, in a nonuser. In conclusion, the risk of serious thromboembolic events and of cerebral isehemia and stroke persists even with the new oral contraceptives at lower oestrogen dosage. The relationship between sex hormone therapy and risk of thrombotic disease has been largely investigated both in women on pill and in postmenopausal women on estrogen treatment. Unopposed estrogen replacement therapy seems to provide cardiovascular protecuon, whereas the addition of a progestogen appears to oppose this benefit, mainly due to the unfavorable changes in lipid metabolism. Only very few data are still available on hemostatic changes during progestogens administered alone. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of blood clotting activation in 10 women (mean age 44+5 years) with functional menorrhagia before and after 3 and 6 month norethindrone acetate therapy (10 mg/die, from day 12 to day 24 of each cycle). The study was performed by evaluating fibrinopeptide A plasma concentration (FPA, ELISA, Boehringer Mannheim) and the activity of the physiological inhibitory systems antithrombin III (ATIII, amidolytic method, Instrumentation Laboratory) and protein C (clotting assay, Bchringwcrke). In all patients a complete relief of symptoms was obtained after the first cycle of treatment. FPA plasma levels significantly increased after 3 months (p<0.01) whereas at 6 month observation they showed a significant decrease (p<0.05). After 3 month treatment ATBI showed a tendency to decrease and was unchanged after 6 months. No significant differences were observed in protein C activity throughout the study. These preliminary data seem to indicate that progestogen treatment induces an early mild increase in thrombin generation which appears to be counteracted by the efficient activity of the main physiological blood clotting inhibitory systems.",

There is epidemiologic evidence that oral contraceptives (OC) increase the risk of thromboembolism. This side effect of OC is thought to be mediated by estrogen induced prothrombotic disturbances within the hemostatic system, In the present study blood coagulation (fibrinogen, fgen, thrombin-antithrombin Illcomplexes, TAT, and prothrombinfragment, F1+2) and fibrinolytic parameters (fibrin split product D-Dimer, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, PAl-l, and plasmin-antiplasmin-complexes, PAP) were evaluated in 16 women on OC (containing 30 p.g ethinylestradiol and 75 ~g gestodene) therapy. Blood samples were taken before and between days 18 and 22 of the 1st, 3rd and 6 th treatment cycle. Fibrinogen levels were found significantly elevated during OC treatment compared with pretreatment values, while TAT and also F 1+2 levels remained unchanged. Treatment induced activation of fibrinolysis was documented by elevated D-Dimer (pretreatment, pt.: 172 ng/ml (range: 65 -640 nglml), cycle 6, c.6:351 nglml (range: 93 -960 ng/ml), p<0.05) and PAP (pt.: 46.6 nglml (13 -220 ng/ml), c.6: 66.4 ng/ml (21 -200 ng/ml), p<0.05) plasma levels. Among the fibrinolytic components a decrease in PAl-1 (pt.: 10.8 ng/ml (2 -56 ng/ml), c.6:5.3 ng/ml (2.2 -14.4 ng/ml), p<0.05) and an increase in t-PA activity (pt.: 0.23 U/ml (0.17 -0.45 U/ml), c.6: 0.33 U/ml (0.2 -0.9 U/ml), p<0.05) was detected. We conclude from our results that during treatment with low estrogen pills 1 .) no significant effect on blood coagulation activation markers is observed and 2.) enhanced intravascular fibrinolytic activity is Factor XII, a 80 kD senna protease, activated by contact with negatively charged surfaces or by enzymatic cleavage, can initiate the intrinsic coagulation system, the fibdnolytic system, the kiflin fomlation and the autoachvation of F XII itself. Although F XII deficiency is most often detected because of prolonged AP'rF pdor to surgery, haemorrhagic incidentS are usually not associated with hereditary F XII deficiency. On the contrary, a number of publications and case repurts deal with thremboembolic events in F XII deficient patients. In our study 103 orally anticoagulated patients suffering from recurrent venous thrombosis, recun'ent arterial thromboembelism and/or recurrent myocardial infarction and 50 healthy subjects were tested for Hageman factor (F XII) activity and antigen. Among the 103 patients we identified 15 subjects with F XII deficiency (15 %), 3 with protein C deficiency (3%) and 3 ~ protein S deficiency (3%). Combined F XII deficiency and protein C, protein S or antithrombin III deficiency was not observed. The 103 patients were divided into subgroups acco~ing to the type of thrombotic complication. Among patients with exclusively recawont venous threroboumbolism 8 % (p = 0.153) were deficient in F XIL Amoog pJefts suffedeg from mcummt adedal thmmbeernbolism and/or myocacd~ infarction, the incidence of F XII deficiency was significantly higher (20 %, p < 0.003). In 67 % of the patients with F XII deficiency a posi6ve family history of thrombosis could be astablished. In contrast, only 32 % (p = 0.043) of all venous and 28 % (p = 0.019) of all artedei thrombosis patients had a positive family history. We believe that reduced levels of F XII should be considered as a dsk factor in the development of thromboembolism. Consequently, more attention should be payed to ~ measurement of F XII when evaluating thrornboerobolic dsk facto~ especially in cases of recorrent artedal thremboembelism and/or myocardial iofarctiou. We previously developed two enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays(ELISA) for quantitation of hirudin in urine or plasma. The competitive ELISA had a detection range of 8 ng/ml to 7.7 Ixg/m [ (Spinner et al. 1986 ). By development of a catching ELISA, based on two polyclonal antibodies, the detection range could be improved to 0.2 to 25 ng/ml in plasma and 0.8 to 200 ng/ml in urine (Spinner et al. 1988 ). These two assays are suited for a sensitive and reproducible quantltation of hirudin in biological fluids although the catching ELISA is limited by the use of rabbit antibodies in the detector mode since the assay is difficult to reestablish when rabbit antibodies are exhausted. Therefore, two second generation assays were developed: in both assays a monoclonal antibody was used in the capture mode and detection was performed either with biotinylated sheep antibodies which are available in sufficient quantities (detection range 0.05 -25 ng/ml) or with a second monclonal antibody (detection range 0.1. 100 ng/ml).",

This assay is based on the sandwich principle using a monoclonal capture antibody, that binds exclusively the hirudin-thrombin complex together with affinity purified, biotinylated polyclonal antibodies to hirudin from sheep as detection antibody. The assay allows for quantitation of hirudin-thrombin complexes in the concentration range between 6.6 and 100 ng/ml. The precision of the assay was evaluated by testing plasma samples, spiked with hirudin-thrombin complexes at concentrations of 0.1 and 600 ng/ml in six different assays. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 4.4~176 (range 1.2 -9.4%), the intsrassay coefficient of variation was 5.4~ (range 2.5 -6.4~ Thrombus-bound thrombin catalyses new fibrin deposition onto the thrombus such providing an important mechanism for thrombus extension. Recent studies showed that thrombin bound to fibrin is resistant to inactivation by the heparin-ATIII complex. This circumstance could explain the limited ability of.hepadn in preventing thrombus extension. Hirudin inhibits thrombin through a stoichiometric complex that does not require any plasma cofactor. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of unfractionated heparin, rhirudin and PEG-rm-hirudin (Knoll AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany), to inhibit thrombin, both in a fluid phase and bound to clot. The three agents were tested over a wide range of concentrations (hirudin and PEG-hirudin from 0.1 to 1000 nM; heparin trom 0.025 to 5 anti-Xa U/ml).

LU 57291 with a MW of 17 kDa now was identified as suitable molecule for further development and its antithrombotic activity was assessed in two rat thrombosis models: (i) thrombosis induced by a thrombogenic glass capillary within an arterio-venous shunt and (ii) electrically induced artedal thrombosis. The artedo-venous shunt was opened 5 rain after Lv. administration of test substances and shunt patency was observed for 30 rain. In control animals an occlusive thrombus was formed after 10,4 % (2.2 min) of the observation period. The EDso (dose for half maximum prolongation of shunt patency) values were 0.21, 1.37 and 0.35 mg/kg for LU 57291, r-hirudin and unfractionated hepadn (UFH), respectively. The duration of action of LU 57291, r-hirudin and UFH was measured 5, 60 and 180 rain after administration (p.a.). Equipotent doses of LU 57291 (0.464 mg/kg), r-Hirudin (2.15 mg/kg) and UFH (1.0 mg/kg) produced 66, 64 and 72 % prolongation of shunt patency 5 rain p.a.. The effect of LU 57291 was even stronger 60 rain p.a. (78 %) and was still substantial (37 %) 180 min p.a.. In contrast the effects of r-hirudin and UFH had decreased to 21 and 42 % 60 min p.a. and 20 and 24 % 180 rain p.a.. In electrically induced thrombosis expedments electdc current (3 mA, 1 min) was applied to the carotid artery 5 rain after Lv. administration of test substances. Blood flow was then observed for 60 rain. In control animals the blood flow was reduced to zero after 7.9 rain. The EDso values for LU 57291, r-hirudin and UFH were 0.12, 0.47 and 0.52 mg/kg, respectively. In vitro coagulation assays in rat and human plasma revealed no significant differences in the concentrations of LU 57291 and r-hirudin needed for 100% prolongation of APi-I, PT and TT, respectively. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in human and rat platelet-dch plasma as well as in suspensions of washed human platelats was equipotently inhibited by LU 57291 and r-hirudin. Desulfato hirudin HV t is a single chain polypeptide composed of 65 aminoacids with a molecular weight of ap.proximately 7000 Daltons. It is produced by a genetically modified strain of E.coli Y.M.109. 24 healthy volunteers aged 20-35 years were investigated to assess the toterabillty of a recombinant Hirudin and to obtain ex vivo data onthe effects of hirudin on coagulation and platelet function parameters. The study was performed as an open, bicentre prospective non randomized phase I-trial with. 4 groups of 6 volunteers each. Group I: 6 volunteers received a single s.c. injection of hirudin with doses of 0.1mg/kg,0,25mg/kg and O.5mg/kg hirudin. Group I1:6 volunteers rece=ved s.c. inject=ons of 0.3mg/kg hlrudin twice daily for 5 days. ~6 vo|unteers received single daily i,v.injections of 0.1mg/kg, O.2mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg hirudin. Group IV: 6 volunteers receivedfor 4 hours an infusion of 0.03mg/kg/h hirudin RESULTS: Groupl: aPTT and thrornbin time were significantly prolonged in a dose dependent manner. Platelet induced thrombin generation time (PITT} andplatelet adhesion were slightly influenced in a dose dependent manner for up to 8 hours. Bleedln 9 time was prolonged needy twofold two hours after the injection ot O.5mg/kg. Groupll: Flirudln led to a dose dependent and significant increase (twofold prolongation) of aPTT 2 hours after each s.c injection while base line values were reached 12 hours later. PITT was less sensitive to detect hirudin than thrombin time or aPTT. Platelet adhesion ;was slightly reduced two hours after the s.c.injections of hirudin. Bleeding time remained unchanged.

There were mild symptoms of DIC before the second injection which considerably increased thereafter. In detail there was a sharp drop of the platelet count and a considerable diminution of Antithrombin III (AT III), Protein C (PC), Plasminogen (Plmg) and Antiplasmin (APL) as well as an appearance of fibrin monomer complexes and an increase of the aPTT. When PEG-hirudin in a single dose of ] mg/kg BW was given simultaneously with the second injection of endotoxin the following alterations could be observed: The drop of the platelet count was significantly less pronounced and similar observations were made with AT III, PC, Plmg and APL. The fibrin monomer complexes were lower after hirudin and the aPTT was less prolonged. The thrombin time,however,as a sign of direct action of hirudin on thrombin was considerably more prolonged in the hirudin group. The effects obtained by PEG-hirudin strongly point into the direction of a favourable influence on DIC caused by endotoxin. It is of special interest that 6 h after the intravenous injection of PEG-hirudin its full effect,measured by the thrombin time, was still detectable. It has been reported, that both thrombinmarkers (TM) thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F 1+2) successfully identify the hazard of acute coronary reocclusion after thrombolysis, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and Stent implantation.

Conclusion: Both TM are equally suitable for the anticoagulation management after BS. Intervention limits, however, should be increased to 150% of those previously described. Discussions for the conception of modern thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are centered on the interrelations between patency, reocclusion and mortality. High early patency, the strongest known predictor for survival, is compromised by frequent reocclnsions; the extent to which these variables can be influenced by anticoagulant treatment is of paramount interest. In a retrospective analysis of 300 clinical trials on 100.000 patients we investigated the influence of early (initial/intralysis) vs late (postlysis) heparin on early patency, reocclusion-and mortality-rates 10d after thrombolysis with various substances. Results: (Fig. 1 ) Odds ratios for an effect of early heparin after throm-t. uK bolysis with iv SK, UK, APSAC, rt-PA or scu-PA on 90min-patency rates were 0.92, 0.81, no data (nd.), 0.92 and nd.

Conelnsion: As anticipated, patency rates 90min after the beginning of thrombolysis were influenced only to a minor extent by the early initiation of adjuvant heparin; a clear improvement was seen on the relative risk of infarct vessel rcocclusion. Effects on mortality were variable; a distinct reduction of mortality risk was notable at~er rt-PA lysis when early was compared to late adjuvant heparin.

In the femoral artery of rabbits as well as in the carotid artery of rats thrombus formation was initiated by damage of the endothelium either by an internal balloon catheter (femoral artery) or by three external vessel clamps (carotid artery). In the rat carotid artery an additional copper cell was placed within the vessel lumen. Endothelial damage together with following stasis for 30 min led to the formation of occlusive arterial thrombi. For measuring thrombus formation, thrombolysis and reocclusion ,either the surface temperature of the vessel or the blood flow were registered. The arterial thrombi formed can be removed by i.v. administration of either streptokinase or r-tPA. However, after successful thrombolysis within a relatively short period of time thrombotic reocclusion of the arteries occurred. In both models the effect of rH and UH on reocclusion processes were investigated. It could be shown that s.c. injection of rH dose-dependently reduced the incidence of reocclusion or prolonged the time until reocclusion occurred. The effective doses for complete prevention ef reoeclusion were 4 mg/kg (rabbits) and I0 mg/kg (rats), resp.

To evaluate whether LU 57291, which is a chemically modified hirudin derivative with prolonged plasma half-life inhibits early reocclusion after thrombolysis, 24 mongrel dogs were randomly allocated to 4 treatment groups: (1) PEG-hirudin 1.0 mg/kg, (2) UFH 50 (50 U/kg + 50 U/kg.h), (3) UFH 100 (100 U/kg + 100 U/kg.h) and (4) control (physiological saline). 30 rain after thrombus induction using a copper coil, introduced into the carotid artery via the left femoral artery, rt-PA (80 pg/kg + 8/~g/kg.min) was given together w~th one of the 4. adiurtct~va t~eatments, r~-PA infusion was terminated aller tepedusion, defined as restoralion el carotid artery blood flow rate.

In contrast, PEG-hirudin and UFH 100 significantly increased the reocclusion time to more than 4 hours, thereby increasing the AP'I-I less than twofold in the PEG-hirudin and up to 15-fold in the UFH-treated group. The buccal bleeding time was not prolonged with PEG-hirudin but significantly elevated in UFH 50 and UFH 100-treated animals. Cyclic reductions in carotid arte~ blood flow preceding thrombus formation were reduced from 12.5 \u2022 3.7 I~\", in the control group to 3.5 +_ ~ A b \"I ~n PEG-hirudin4reate~ animals. UFH 50 had no effect on the frequency of CFRs, whereas UFH 100 diminished CFRs to 3.6 -4-1.1 h \"1. These d~a show that PEG-hirudin, in contrast to therapeutic doses of UFH, inhibits thrembus formation in this reocclusion model without affecting haemostasis. Low concentrations of heparin and other high grade sulfated oligosaccharides (SO) cause platelat activation with antibsdies of HAT sere. Empirically it has been shown that high concentrations of heparin (100 U/ml) inhibit the activatory affect of the antibody (Sheridan D. et al Blood 1986; 67:27-30) . To further charaterize the underlying mechanism we performed inhibition studies and pletelet function studies using SO with a different homology to heparin. Heparin and other high grade SO in high concentrations in the fluid phase completely inhibited the platelet activating effect of the HAT antibody. However, the same was true for low grade SO as de-Nsulfated heparin, which neither caused platelet activation in low concentrations nor interfered with heparin binding to platelets. After washing the platelets, this inhibitory effect was no longer demonstrable (1-ab.;14C-Serotonin release; mean of 3 experiments). We conclude, that the antigen involved in HAT can bind to low grade and high grade SO. The antigen-antibody compiexes come in close proximity to the platelet surface by the negative charge of high grade SO. There they activate platelets via the platelet FoR II receptor. This study gives evidence that the antigen involved in HAT might be formed by a releaseable platelet protein with a heparin binding site.",

            "text": "added Antithrombotic therapy in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II still remains difficult. We have previously shown in patients with HIT type II that low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) crossreact with heparin-associated antibodies. At present, the heparinoid Org 10172 (Orgeran R) appears to be the most promising agent in these patients, specifically when anticoagulation therapy cannot be discontinued. However, the availability of Org 10172 is restricted. Himdin would be an alternative agent, however, to date, it has not been used for therapy of HIT type II. To assess the potential benefit and risk of treatment with hirudin, we have performed serial studies in vitro in 6 patients with HIT type iI and thrombosis. Clinical diagnosis of HIT was confirmed by platelet aggregometry. An irreversible aggregation of platelets from healthy volunteers was demonstialcd .p~ addii~on of paZici,t elasni~ eaid hcpuriH (0..5 and:o~ i IU/ml). Corresponding experiments were performed with Fragmin R, Fraxiparin R, Clexane R, Neo-Embolex R (all at 1 IU anti-Xa/ml) and Org 10172 (1 U/ml). r-hirudin (Pentafarm, Basel, Switzerland) was tested at final concentrations of 0.4 #g/ml (n---6) and 4 #g/ml (n=2) using otherwise identical experimental conditions. In all 6 patients irreversible platelet aggregation was inducible with all LMWH preparations tested, confirming cross reactivity of the heparin-associated antibodies with LMWH. In contrast, no platelet aggregation was observed in any case neither with Org 10172 nor with r-hirudin. These results suggest that r-Hirudin may be a valuable anticoagulant for treatment of HIT type II. The FXII-plasma kallikrein (FXII-KK) systems are activated during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We have reported that the high heparin levels used in CPB contribute to this activation. We have developed an ex viva CPB model and are using this to study the effects of simulated CPB on cellular elements and components of the contact systems of blood. In the present study we have compared the effects of four fractionated (F) and four unfractionated (UF) heparins on components of the FX/I-KK systems in this model. Chromogenic peptide substrate and immunochemical assays were used to measure heparin (H), FXII, alpha-FXIIa and 6FXIIa inhibition (alpha-FXIIaI, IIFXIIaI), prekallikrein (PKK), kallikrein like activity CKK\"), kallikrein inhibition (KKI) and PMN elastase-alphal-proteinase inhibitor complexes (E-alpha-lPI). Heparin levels fell throughout the circulation period with two F heparins showing the largest falls. With three UF and three F heparins falls in alpha-FXIIaI, BFXIIaI and PKK were seen. \"KK\" rose and KKI fell with all heparins but with one F and one UF heparin these changes were less pronounced. E-alpha-lPI levels rose throughout the circulation period with all heparins, with lesser rises with two heparins (one F one UF). Our results show that activation of the FXII-KK systems occurred with all of the heparins studed. Two heparins were less active than the others. From these results it is clear that our model is suitable for selecting heparins (or other anticoagulants) with minimal activating effects on the FXII-KK systems in CPB. These studies have led to the introduction of one of these heparins in our clinic and beneficial effects have been observed.",

Blood samples were taken before arculation and at various time intervals after the commencement of simulated CPB. 10 runs were performed for each treatment. Parameters measured included: FXII, IIFXIIa inhibition, kallikrein inhibition, kallikrein like activity and PMN elastase-.al.p.ha-l-proteinase inhibitor complexes (E-alpha-lPI). With heparin, activation of the contact systems occurred. With heparin plus aprotinin and with hirudin this activation was much less. In particular kallikrein like activities and E-alpha-lPI levels were markedly lower in the latter two groups. The least activation was seen with hirudin. Our results confirm that the contact systems of blood are activated during CPB with heparin as anticoagulant, that aprotinin reduces this activation and that hirudin would be preferred to heparin as an anticoagulant in CPB. We have previously reported that activation of the contact systems of blood occurs both in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and in simulated CPB in an ex vivo model. Wehave implicated high heparin levels in this activation and shown that both unfractionated and fractionated heparins possess this ability. We have now used heparin coated oxygenators in our CPB model with low heparin levels in blood and compared activation of the contact systems under these conditions with simulated CPB with normal heparin levels. In our model recalcified ACD blood was circulated for 90 minutes in a closed circuit system. Blood samples were taken before and at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 minutes during circulation. With 0.5 U/all heparin in the heparinised oxygenator microscopic clots were seen after 60 minutes. With 1.0 U/ml heparin no clots were seen. We therefore compared 1.O U/ml heparin in the heparinised oxygenators with 5.0 U/ml in the non-heparinised oxygenators. Heparin levels were measured in the plasma samples together with various components of the contact systems of blood. Haemolysis, platelet count and PMN elastase-alpha-1proteinase inhibitor complex levelswere also determined. Haemolysis was significantly lower as were the falls in platelets in the heparinised oxygenator group. Activation of the contact systems of blood was also markedly lower in this group. Our results show that in our ex wvo model lower blood heparin levels can be used with heparinised oxygenators with beneficial effects on cellular elements of blood and reduced activation of the contact systems.",

In both groups the operation lasted 4-5 hours. In addition two subgroups were formed in which two different LMW-heparius were administered as thrombosis prophylaxis. Blood was taken on the day of the operation, intraoperatively and on the three subsequent postoperative days. Since patients with malignant neoplasias have a particularly high risk of developing thromboembolic complications these patients were again evaluated separately in a second part of the study using two different LMW.heparins. The evaluation of particular proteins of the contact phase suggests a stronger activation of the kallikrein-kinin system with LMW-heparin a. For the alphafactor XIIa inhibition and the B-factor XIIa inhibition a significant rise could be detected in both groups in the course of the five days of observation whereby this effect was more marked in the LMW-heparin b group. In the comparison of the patients with malignant neoplasias and the trauma patients the behaviour differed markedly with regards to the alpha-and B-factor XIIa inhibition.In the evaluation of the TAT values, however, the behaviour differed totally for the two medications: these values were distinctly higher in the LMW-heparin b group. The difference in the patients with malignant diseases was even more dramatic. On the first postoperative day this value was four times higher in the LMWheparin b group than in the LMW-hcparin a group. Postoperatively the flbrinogea level rose stronger with LMW-haparin b. Furthermore, in the group of patients with malignant disease the intraoperative values were lower for this heparin derivate. These results were clearly to be attributed to a stronger activation of clotting with the prophylactic treatment using LMW-heparin b. It was possible to establish that this assumption correlates very well with data gained for the fihrinolytic system: The tissue plasminogen activator rose clearly more strongly in the LMW-heparin b group as an expression of the reactively increased fibrinolysis. This was to be observed to a greater degree in the patients with maligmant disease. As a result in this group significantly higher plasma ddimer levels were also to be detected (p=0.04). Finally, it can be said that the results gained here indicate a distinctly greater efficiency of the LMW-heparln b in the case of extensive trauma after mandibulo-facial surgery, particularly, it appears, for patients with malignant neoplasias.",

Experimental studies showed that the antithrombotic effect of unfractionated heparin (UH) and LMWHs is critically dependent on their ability to catalyse factor Ila inhibition. Anti-Ila specific activity of LMWHs ranges between 25% and 50% of their anti-Xa specific activity; in addition, anti-Ila plasma half-life of LMWHs appears to be shorter than that of UH. Therefore either anti-Ila activity of LMWHs is not so crucial or it has not been properly assessed. We set up a new test (PTNA, Agnelli et al. 1992 ) able to detect low plasma levels of anti-Ila activity. The aim of this study is to compare pharrnacokinetics of anti-Ila activity assessed with PTNA of UH and LMWH Enoxaparine.

In patients treated with subcutaneous heparin b.i.d., the aPTT is subtherapeutic in the first and last 3 hours of the treatment interval. Therefore either a constant aPTT prolongation is not necessary or heparin exerts an antithrombotic effect that is not measured by the aPTT.

            "text": "The results of the study are shown in the and blood loss indices were observed in both groups. I patient in the LMWH-group (0,9%) developed phlebographically proven deep vein thrombosis (DTV) versus 2 (1,82%) in the UFH-group. One pulmonary embolism occured in the UFH-group. The present trial demonstrates that a single daily subcutaneous injection of \"AntiXarin\" is so effective and safer than the established low dose subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis with 5000 units three times per day in preventing postoperative DVT. About 300,000 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastic procedures (PTCA) were performed last year in the USA. However, the long-term success rate is only 50-70% due to the smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation at the angioplasty site which may result in restenosis. Laboratory results suggest that heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) have an inhibitory effect on SMC migration and proliferation as well as the development of intercellular matrix. Thus long term treatment with LMWH could be beneficial for patients who have undergone PTCA, but little is known about the long-term effects of daily s.c. injections of LMWH. A study was performed to mimic the full anticoagulation during PTCA with unfractionated heparin, followed by prophylaxis with LMWH (Mono-Embolexe) over a 12 week period in nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta). Blood was drawn at baseline and once a week, pdor to the daily injection of LMWH. The following hematologic parameters were analyzed: RBC, WBC, platelet, lymphocyte, granulocyte and monocyte count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, MPV, and flow cytometry of WBC's. For platelet aggregation studies blood was drawn 5 hours after the initial full heparinization and once each week, 4 hours after the s.c. Mono-Embolexe injection. There were no significant alterations of RBC's including Hb, Hct, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW. The overall WBC count did not change, although a significant increase of granulocytes with a corresponding decrease of lymphocytes and monocytes occurred. This was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. However, in previous studies with other glycosaminoglycans and saline treated primates a similar transitory effect was noticed. These findings suggest that the alterations of the WBC are related to the chronic stress processes caused by the s.c. injection procedure and not to the drug. Platelet function studies as well as platelet count were unaffected by this treatment. In conclusion, a 12 week administration of Mono-Embolexe as projected for the use in the prophylaxis of restenosis did not produce any alteration of the hematologic parameters in the primates treated with this agent. Elective hip surgery without antithrombotic protection is followed by a high prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DV-r) with a risk of total DVI estimated at 50 % and of proximal DVT at 25 %. The estimated risk of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) ranges from 1.8 % to 3.5 %. Therefore, protection of the patient is mandatory. The effectiveness of Low molecular weight hepedns (LMWHs) in preventing such thrombotic complications has been demonstrated. LMWHs have been shown to be more effective than Dextren, than unfractionated Hepadn (UH), when given in a standard regimen (8 times 5 000 IU/day), and as effective and safe as UH when adapted daily to the upper normal range of the activated partial thromboplastin time. Clivadne | (INN: Reviparin sodium, LU 47811) is manufactured from high purity standard Heparin (mucosa) by cleavage with nitrous acid and subsequent chromatographic purification. The mean molecular weight is between 3 500 -4 500 Daltons. More than 90 % of Revipadns molecules have a molecular weight distribution of between 2 600 and 8 000 Daltons. In general surgery a dose of 1 750 aXa IU has beer] found safe and effective in a large muiticenter-trial. To define the dosage that should be safe and effective in orthopedic surgery two consecutive clinical trials were conducted: 1) a randomized ascending dose ranging trial in which 3 doses of Reviparin were compared and thereafter 2) an open pilot study, to confirm both the efficacy and the safety of the previously recommended dose. The results based on 36 and 50 patients respectively indicate an excellent efficacy (incidence of DVT 6 %) of LU 47311 administered at a dosage of 4 200 IU aXa once daily. No increase in bleeding was observed at this dose level. From these results we conclude that with a fixed single daily dosage of Clivadne a high level of efficacy can be reached without increased risk for bleeding and with good clinical practicability. Antithrombotic protection of patients after orthopedic surgery must be considered mandatory in view of the high incidence of deep venous thrombosis (Dr'r) estimated at 50 % if no prophylactic measure is taken. When given in a standard (3 times 5 OO0 IU/day) or adapted regimen (upper normal range of the activated partial thrembopiastin time) unfractionated hepadn (UH) decreases the risk of DVT, however such an approach requires intensive monitoring and appears impractical in normal hospital routine. From dose finding studies with the Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) Clivarine | an excellent efficacy (incidence of DVT 6 %) was found with no increase in bleeding complications. On the basis of these results it was considered to compare Clivadne | to another Low molecular weight Hepadn. In a first pilot study involving a total of 40 patients either 4 200 aXa IU of Clivarine | ((3) or 40 mg of Enoxaparine ~ (E') were administered to patients undergoing elective hip surgery. The objeotive of this study was to verify the safety of the do~age regimen for Clivarine | In spite of the small number of patients, bleeding parameters such as peri-(C: n = 2, E: n = 2, p = 1.0) and postoperative transfusions, hemoglobin, drain volume (C: 472 -+ 298 ml, E: 517 _+ 167 ml, p = 0.69) and loss of blood into compresses ((3:612 _+ 145, E: 712 +_ 228, p = 0.12) revealed an excellent safety profile of Clivadne | On the basis of this preliminary experience a large muiticentdc double-blind trial comparing Clivarine | with Enoxapedne | was designed.",

Out of three fusion experiments we isolated 10 monccional antibodies reactive with thrombin and the hitudin-thrombin complex as judged by indirect ELISA. In capture ELISA, any of the antibodies was able to capture thrombin and the hirudin4hrombin complex but not hirudin. Western-Blot analysis showed, that the mAbs are directed against continuous determinants located on the B-chain of thrombin. All antibodies bound also to human prothrombin but differed in their reactivities with bovine thrombin: five mAbs bound exclusively to human thrombin, whereas the other mAbs reacted with both, human and bovine thrombin. Two out of the ten antibodies inhibited clotting activity, indicating that these antibodies bind to epitopes that are located in the region of the fibrinogen binding site of thrombin. In contrast, none of these mAbs had any effect on hirudin induced clo~ing inhibition. The antigenic structure of hirudin was studied using a panel of monoclonal antibodies out of five fusions. Twelve monoclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing mice either with recombinant hirudin (rHV1) or a synthetic peptide, representing the C-terminal sequence 40-65. Epitope analysis was performed by competitive ELISA using denatured r-hirudin, natural hirudin, recombinant hirudin PA (rHV3) and different peptides. Eleven monocional antibodies (C1 -C10,4120-37-7) were directed against continuous determinants located within the 14 C-terminal amino acids of hirudin. Using various peptides, representing different parts of the carboxyterminal sequence of hirudin, it was shown that each monoclonal represents an unique idiotypa. As judged by competitive ELISA, these antibodies bind to adjacent but distinct sites within the C-terminus of hirudin. One monoclonal antibody (4049-83-12), directed against a discontinuous determinant was reactive with sulfated natural hirudin and the peptide 1-61, but failed to react with r-hirudin PA, the C-terminal peptides and peptide 1-43 (Schlaeppi et el., 1990). As expected, the latter mAb binds to an epitope, distinct from all other clones. Finally it was investigated whether six of the twelve mAbs were able to inhibit the formation of the hirudin-thrombin complex. Three mAbs neutralized the hirudin induced clotting inhibition completely, two antibodies had weaker neutralizing capacities and one mAb had no effect on complex formation. In experimental venous thrombosis recombinant hirudin (r-hirudin) has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of thrombus formation by specific inhibition of thrombin. Because of the rapid clearance of rhirudin from the circulation, efforts were made to bind hirudin to larger molecules to prolong its duration of action. Unspecific binding of hirudin to oxidized dsxtrans (Markwardt et al., Biomed. Biochim. Acts 49:1103 -8, 1990 ), however, was associated with a considerable loss of specific activity. Specific coupling of hirudin to polyethyleneglycol (PEG) led to derivatives with prolonged plasma half-life. The aim of our study was to correlate the antithrombotic effect of PEG-hirudin (LU 57291) and r-hirudin with their anti-factor-lie-activity. White New Zealand rabbets were randomly allocated to 11 groups, each group contained 5 rabbits. After intravenous injection of either LU 57291 or r-hirudin at various doses, jugular vein thrombosis was induced by the intraarterial injection of tissue-thromboplastin combined with stasis for 30 min (stasis beginning 61/2 min after drug application). The size of the formed thrombus within each isolated vessel segment was evaluated by visual scoring. LU 57291 and r-hirudin dose-dependently inhibited thrombus-formation. The ED50 was 0.089 mg/kg for LU 57291 and 0.154 mg/kg for r-hirudin, showing a higher antithrombotic efficacy for LU 57291 than for r-hirudin. The close linear correlation found in both groups between anti-factor-lie-activity and antithrombotic effect (r=0.852 and 0.727, rasp.) indicates that the difference in antithrombotic efficacy is due to the different kinetic behaviour of both compounds. Hirudin is known as a potent direct inhibitor of thrombin and is gaining increasing interest as an anticoagulant and a potential antithrombotic drug. Therefore a suitable assay should be available which can measure hirudin plasma levels of patients after intravenous or subcutaneous hirudin injections. We have developed a simple and fast chromogenic substrate assay which has a wide measuring range and can be performed automatically by a centrifugal analyzer. A variety of relatively complicated hirudin assay have been described, the plasma often has to be pretreated and they can only be performed manually.",

Prior to the clinical introduction of hlrudln we have developed a new method for the determination of hirudln in whole blood. The method based on the interaction of hlrudin with melzothrombln, an intermediate product of the Ecarln induced prothrombin-thrombln-converslon. Ecarln is a highly purified fraction from Echis carlnatus venom. In contrast to the physiological solid phase prothrombln activation process, the Ecarln induced prothrombln activation produces predominantly other intermediates, for instance meizothrombln.

The linear correlation between the hlrudln blood concentration and the prolongation of the Ecarln time within the therapeutic range allows a good clinical use. Another advantage is the applicability of this method to various measurement principles used In coagulation diagnostics, especially the method is applicable to automated analysis systems. The postoperative thera W of patients after heart valve implantation with oral anticoagulants (cumarin derivatives) is equal to walking a tightrope between tbromboembolitic complications and a raised tendency to bleed. The risk to the individual patient of sufferin$ thromboembolitic complications is the sum of the personal task factors involved (hypertension, smoker, diabetes etc.) and the thrnmbogenity of the type of valve used. An optimum adjustment of the anticoagulation related to the individual patient and based on empirical comparative data has up to now been unsuccessful due to the non-standardized methods for determining the quick values. Butchart (1) evaluated, retrospectively, the INR that was most successful, for one particular valve type over a period of ten years. The INR measurement normally used in the western world cannot be transfe4~l directly to the quick measurement used by us. INR = FFR ~~ whereby FFR (prothrombin ratio) is the quotient of patient and standard plasma thromboplastin time. The ISI (international sensitivity index) results from the different sensitivity of the thromboplastin reagent employed. On the basis of the clotting tests of 20 heart valve patients undergoing postoperative marcumar therapy a nomogram was developed facilitating a direct correlation between quick value and INR. Since the world's leading manufacturers of heart valves are to be found in the USA (apart from Sorin) the data (INR) required for registration with the FDA cannot be applied here or can only be correlated approximately. Therefore it would be desirable for countries not part of the western world to covert to INR. The present study is intended as a contribution in this respect.",

We recently demonstrated that a decrease in platelet function in addition to the wellknown DIC-like state and the decrease in platelet count may further aggravate the clinical situation. PGE1 has been shown to exhibit a platelet protective effect in extracorporal circulation as well as to have a beneficial effect in primary liver graft nonfunction. Materials and methods: In an open, prospective and randomized study we investigated the effect of PGE1 infusion during OLT on platelet count, platelet function and several parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Ten patients were randomized to receive a continuous PGE1 infusion (PG group, 30+10#g/h) and other ten patients served as controls. Platelet function was determined ex vivo by measuring the adenosine diphosphate-, collagen-and ristocetin-induced aggregation in platelet rich plasma. Results: In the control group we measured a significant drop in platelet count and platelet aggregability after revascularisation of the graft, In the PG group significantly better preserved platelet aggregability was measured throughout the whole operation and no significant decline in neither platelet count nor platelet aggregability occured during the early reperfusion phase. Tissue-type plasminogen activator activity was significantly higher in the PG group during the anhepatic phase, concomittant with lower c~2-antiplasmin levels. However, no signs of increased fibrinolysis were observed in thrombelastography in both groups and all the other parameters of hemostasis were comparable. Conclusion: Intraoperative PGE1 infusion preserves platelet function and prevents the drop in ptatelet count during OLT observed in the control group during reperfusion. Tenoxicam is an antiinflammatory thienothiazine derivative of the oxicam class, able to interlere with prostaglandin synthesis. Our purpose was to investigate the in vitro effects of this agent on TxB2 production by monocytes, and on TxB2, LTB2 and LTC4by neutrophils. Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by plastic adherence and incubated with lipopolysaccaride (LPS) (10 ~g/ml) for 4 h at 37~C in a CO 2 incubator in the presence and in the absence of increasing drug concentrations from 1 and 5 p.g/ml, reached in therapeutic use, to 10 and 100 ~g/ml. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were isolated by counterflow centrifugal elutriator (JE-6, Beckman), washed and incubated for 10 minutes at 37~C, with LPS in the presence and the absence of increasing drug concentrations (1,5,10,100 p.gtml) TxB2, LTB4 and LTC4 were assayed by RIA (NEN DuPont, London). After incubation with different concentrations ot Tenoxicam, monocyte TxB2 production was inhibited dose dependently, by 41% at the lowest concentrations, and the inhibitory effect increased up to 75% at 100p.g/ml; in neutrophils by the inhibition of TxB2 production was 35% at the lowest concentrations and increased up to 71% No variations in LTB4 and C4 neutrophils production were observed at any concentration. These results suggested that the decrease of araohidonic acid metabolltes in monocytes and neutrophils by Tenexicam at drug concentrations comparable to dose reached in therapeutic use, may contribute to the reduction of inflammatory reactions.",

Interferon A treatment starting at 5 million units per day was initiated in 5 patients with thrombocythaemia with average thromboeyte counts over 900.000/hi. 4 of these patients had thrombotic complications and 1 had had bleeding complications assoeiatad with falls in F.VIII:C, yon Willebrand's factor and ristoeetin cofaetor. No further complications arose in any of these patients. Bleeding time and thrombocyte function tests (ADP and collagen, ristocetininduced aggregation) could not be eorrelatad with complications. PAl and yon Willebrand's factor levels in thrombocytes and plasma were performed to see whether there was any correlation to a bleeding or thrombotic tendency. We suggest that a hie.h PAl in thromboeytes may be an indication of tendency to thrombosis. Lowered yon Willebrand's factory levels in plasma and thrombocytes may be an increased tendency tobIeeding complications. Thermally injured patients have an increased incidence of hemostatic abnormalities. Their proneness to thrombogenicity is explained by decreases in anticoagulants such as AT III, Protein C, Protein $, and increases in fibrinolysis as evidenced by D-dimer and tPA elevation. To determine the role of platelets on admission and 5-7 days into recovery, (platelet activating factors) thromboxane B 2 (TxB2) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) and an antiaggregating agent 6-keto-prostaglandin Fla~ph. (PGF~,~p,,) were studied. Blood samples were collected in EDTA-indomethacin from 60 patients, 47M/13F, av age 37 yrs and studied by radioimmunoassay. The data was categorized by % burn (2~176 <20%, n=22, 20-40%, n=18, >40%, n=20. Statistical analyses showed no correlation of the platelet-related parameters to infection or inhalation, although the platelets were activated (increased TxB 2 and PF4). In the >40% group, PGFI~ph = was significantly increased in those who did not survive compared to survivors (p <0.007). Platelets were also significantly reduced in the >40% burn group on Day5 compared to Day 1 (p <0.001) which may reflect an exhaustion of marrow production. With significant platelet activation in all patients and a decrease of the antiaggregating factor in the <40% burn group, but a significant increase in the more severely burned, further studies are warranted to determine the clinical relevance of these findings as they relate to platelet function, microthrombi production, neutrophil activation, fibrinolytic debris and cytokine levels. Contact-induced neutrophil activation by platelets which results in a generation of reactive oxygen species (ROE) has been previously described. We will show here that stirring of samples of citrated whole blood (WE) known to cause a spontaneous platelet aggregation induced ROE generation in neutrophils (measured as luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence). Prevention of platelet aggregation by ~DTA inhibited ROE formation. As a measure for the capacity of neutrophils to generate ROE we determined their chemiluminescence response elicited by zymosan and PMA. The extent of spontaneous platelet aggregation measured in separate samples of WE revealed a strong inverse correlation with the capacity of neutrophils to generate ROS.",

PAF is a potent platelet stimulus. Because of the questionable influence on the coagulation system we studied the effect of PAF as well as of the PAF-antagonist WEB 2086 (Boehringer Ingelheim) on a whole blood model of hemostasis in vitro. Sequential specimens were collected in 1-minute-intervals fram coagulating whole blood to determine the concentrations of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) -a marker of thrambin activity -as well as of the release protein platelet factor 4 (PF 4). Initially the controls (n=8) showed low concentrations of both parameters (\"slow phase\") and a substantial increase (\"rapid phase\") after an incubation time of 3.9_+0.8 minutes (FPA; x+SD) and of 3.8_+0.5 rain.

The FPA generation influenced by PAF, showed an earlier beginning of the rapid phase ( Platelet function changes induced by thrombolytic agents have been referred either to a degradation of platelet surface receptors or to the antiaggregatory effect of fibrincgen degradation products (FgDPs). We evaluated platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen and ristocetin after in vitro incubation of washed platelets or platelet rich )plaSma (PRP) with Plasmin (1-3 CU/ml) or plasminogen activators As) (Streptokinase, 250-1,000 U/ml; Urokinase, 10-1,000 U/ml; t-PA, 0.5-10 pg/ml) or FgDPs (0.062-2 mg/ml). FgDPs were generated by extensive degradation of human purified fibrinogen (Kabi, Sweden) with plasminogen (100 pg/ml) and urokinase (5000 U/ml). We have in parallel evaluated surface levels of platelet GP Ib and lib-Ilia by fluorescence flow cytometry and specific monoclonal antibody. Washed platelets treated with plasmin (1 CU/ml) for 10 to 60 minutes showed a progressive reduction of ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination and a progressive proteolysis of surface GP lb. The rate of agg,uJna~ion was a,ready reduced a, G, Ib level o, abou, oC% c, basal values, whereas the maximal amplitude of agglutination curves was reduced only when more than 75% of GP Ib had been cleaved. Surface expression of GP lib-Ilia was significantly increased after plasmin exposure. The addition of PAs to PRP resulted in a marked reduction of ADPinduced platelet aggregation. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was only slightly affected. Similar changes were observed when PRP was preincubated with high concentrations of FgDPs. Platelet surface levels of GP Ib and GP Itb-Illa after PAs exposure showed only minor changes. In conclusion our results show that in plasma no proteolysis of platelet adhesive receptors occurs after plasminogen activation. The platelet inhibition observed after incubation of PRP with PAs is likely to be caused by FgDPs generation. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the result of two interdependent processes -arteriosclerosis and thrombosis -in which platelet-veasel wall contact plays a central role. An in vitro method for quantitative assessment of platelet-wall interaction has, as of yet, not survived clinical application. The Stagnation-Point-Flow.Adhesio.Aggregometer (SPAA). a novel method permitting the previous, was thus clinically evaluated. The SPhA provides on-line registration of platelet microthrombus formation on a standardized surface super[used with platelet rich plasma (PRP). Thereby, morphornetric separation and subsequent quantification of platelet adhesion versus aggregation is possible. Mathematical evaluation of resulting growth curves yields constants reflecting adhesion (Kpw=%) and aggregation (Kpp=%). 40 healthy volunteers divided into those under (n=20) and those over 45 years of age (n=20) and 40 patients (pts.) exhibiting PAD were examined. The PAD pts. were divided into diabetics (n=12) and nondiabetics (n=28). All pts. had received antiplatelet therapy prior to examination. The control group exhibited adhesion values (Kpw) ranging from 0.4% to 1.1% (average Kpw: 0.71%-+0.21). No significant difference in Kpw be,\";~o~n older and younger control subgroups was observed. The coefficient of variation for adhesion in volunteers examined 3 times or more (n=20) ranged from 6% to 14% of respective Kpw value. No spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed (Kpp=0). In the PAD group the mean observed Kpw and Kpp were: nondiabetics (Kpw: 1.56% \u00a7 0.31%; Kpp: 1.41% +/. t.00%), diabetics (Kpw: 1.94% \u00a7 0.79%, Kpp: 2.10% +/-1.39%). Spontaneous aggregation was observed in 50% of all nondiabetic exps. and in all exps. with diabetics. Differences between controls and pts. were statistically highly significant (t-test; p<0.001). The platelet function of healthy individuals appears independent of age and demonstrates low intraindividual variance. The markedly increased adhesion observed in the PAD pts. and the common occurrence of spontaneous aggregation confirm the presence of hyperreactive platelets in these pts. in spite of antiplatelet therapy. Our preliminary findings indicate the predictive power of the SPAA and suggest it suitable for monitoring the therapeutic effectiveness of present as well as future antiplatelet therapy. Platelet activation is important in both arterial and venous thrombosis. With the Stagnation Point Adhasio-Aggregometer (SPAA), pletelet hyperreactivity was confirmed in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). To determine the effect of acute vascular occlusion, as well as of subsequent antithrombotic therapy on SPAA test results, 8 patients having suffered acute thrombosis were examined. The SPAA provides well defined flow conditions whereby platelet microthrombus formation can be directly observed and measured continuously. Mathematical evaluation of resulting growth curves renders the constants for adhesion and aggregation, Kpw (%) and Kpp (%), respectively. Four patients (pts.) with acute arterial thrombosis (hAT) and 4 patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were examined upon admission and up to 10 days thereafter. Results were compared to those of 40 healthy volunteers (no medications) and of 28 PAD Patients. PAD and AAT pts. were treated with: 500rag of Aspirin + 5000 lU LMW-Heparin/day. The DVT Lots. received: 28,000 to 32,000 IU unfractioned heparin/day. Plasma fibrinogen concentration was also determined (Clauss method). The adhesion in the control group was Kpw: 0.71% +/-0.21%. That of the PAD pts. was Kpw: 1,56% +/-0.31%. The control collective exhibited no spontaneous aggregation (Kpp=0). The frequency of aggregation in the PAD pts. was 50% (Kpp= 1.40% +/-1.00%). In hAT and DVT pts. an up to sevenfold increase in Kpw as compared to mean control value (Kpw range: from 2.00% to 5.00%) and the constant occurrence of aggregation (Kpp range: from 1.60% to 14.00%) was observed. Plasma fibrinogen levels were increased up to 690g/I. In the test period, Kpw and Kpp values remained higher than respective PAD means, Aggregation decreased more rapidly than did adhesion and its longitudinal course paralleled that of plasma fibrinegen. Both platelet functions were markedly increased after thrombosis and remained elevated in spite of antithrombotic therapy. The more rapid decline and close correlation to plasma fibrinogen concentration indicate aggregation to represent an acute phase response. Aside from demonstrating the need for further improvement in conventional therapy, our findings suggest the SPAA to be a useful adjunct in platelet testing. Recognition of PTP due to anticoagulant-induced platelet clumping is important because a falsely low platelet count may lead to unnecessary diagnostic procedures and unjustified, potentially harmful treatment. For a detailed study we selected 10 out of 1 6 patients with PTP that had been admitted to our hospital with the presumed diagnosis of a thrombocytopenia. Blood was collected into K2EDTA (6.5 mM; final concentration), Na-oxalate (10 raM), Na-'citrate (15 raM), acid-citrate dextrose (ACD) (NIH-formula A; 1/10 vol), heparin (100 U/ml), hirudin (50 #g/ml) and PPACK (lOpM) and counted immediately in parallel in a Coulter T540 and a Coulter STKS counter and by phase contrast microscopy. Counts were repeated after 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240 and 360 minutes. Results: In phase contrast microscopy of finger-stick blood mean platelet count was 285 G/L. With the Coulter T540 model the mean platelet count dropped to a minimum of 30 G/L (EDTA), 94 G/L (oxalate), 108 G/L (citrate), 156 G/L (ACD), 111 G/L (heparin), 112 G/L (PPACK) and 139 G/L (hirudin), resp. The time course of platelet counts was significantly different with the'STKS model revealing minimal counts after 30 minutes of 69 G/L (EDTA), 35 G/L (oxalate), 73 G/L (citrate), 80 G/L (ACD), 60 G/L (heparin), 73 G/L (PPACK) and 61 G/L (hirudin). With exception of EDTA-and heparinblood, counts increased again reaching a stable plateau at about 90 minutes after blood sampling. In both counters PTP was less pronounced when ACD was used, In the T540 model PTP was accompanied by a pseudoleucocytosis only when EDTA was used with a significant increase in leucocyte count from 7.1 G/L to 10.6 G/L. In contrast, with the STKS model a concomitant pseudoleucoeytosis was present also in oxalate-, heparin-and citrate-blood. In EDTA~ an abnormal plate]et histogram was detected only in 28% of measurements in the T540 model and in 38% of measurements in the STKS counter. Conclusions: It is important to recognize the laboratory artifact of PTP and pseudoleucocytosis to avoid inappropriate treatment. PTP is most pronounced when EDTA-anticoagulated blood is used. However, there is no anticoagulant that reliably prevents falsely low piatelet counts in patients with PTP. The least decline in platelet counts was observed when ACD-anticoagulated samples were used. The efficacy in the detection of platelet clumping by automatic cell counters is low.",

Decreased platelet volume and increased susceptibility of platelets to antiaggregatory prostaglandin E 1 indicate a favourable influence of quitting on platelet reactivity. Effective inhibition of platelet function is important in several clinical conditions. Published data on aspirin-nonresponders initiated us to look whether nonresponsiveness to oral aspirin-therapy could be corrected in vitro. Aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP; Chronologaggregometer) was initiated by arachidonic acid (AA; 1.5 mmol), collagen (COL;0.5 and 2.0 ~g/ml) and ADP (2 ~mol); thromboxane B2 was measured in serum and in collagen-aggregated PRP (ELISA). In 29 patients (9 controls, 20 on aspirin) aspirin-induced inhibition of aggregation could best be seen in AA-and in low-dose COL-induced aggregation, while high-dose COL and different doses of ADP did not allow clear distinction between controls and aspirin-treated patients. In another 19 patients on permanent aspirintherapy (i00 mg/d), five patients showed an AAinduced aggregation of > 50 % (\"nonresponders\"); their TXB2-production was 21.6 ng/ml in serum and 15.1 ng/ml in COL-aggregated PRP (cp. to 5.6 and 2.4 ng/ml in \"responders\"). After addition of aspirin (i00 ~g/ml) to the PRP of the nonresponders, the AA-aggregation decreased from 72.7 to 6.9 % and the TXB2-production to 4.0 resp. 0.2 ng/ml. These data show that in patients on permanent aspirin-therapy who do not show an adequate inhibition of platelet function, additional aspirin in vitro can effectively inhibit aggregation and TXB2-production. Thus the inadequate effect of aspirin seems to be a problem of pharmacokinetics or of compliance. Blood rheology is an important factor in the interaction between platelets and biomaterials surface. In order to study the effect of shear rate on platelets, we quantiated platelets adhered on biomaterials surface using monoclonal antibodies to human platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in range of shear rate from 50 to 3,000s-1 in vitro. Infusion system in vitro consists of a pump and biomaterial tube. 20 ml donor's blood was perfused to last 5 min corresponding to a wall shear rate from 50 to 3000S-1. Then, silicone tubes were perfused with the monoclonal antibody labeled by 125-Iodine for 10 rain. Quantity of platelets adhered on the surface of biomaterials was determined according to the radio-immuno assay. Adhered platelets were identfied by SEM. The results show that adhesion of plateleta on surface of biomaterials is a dynamic process. Enlargement of shear rate is able to rinse out platelets which have adhered but not deteriorated from biomaterials surface, and increase the activity of platelet deteriorated on the surfaces. This conclusion is corresponding with other investigators. Quantity of adherent platelets on the surface changes with increase of shear rate in the range of 50 -3000S-1. But it is out of proportion to increasing of shear rate in our experiment. There were two \"critical points of shear rate\", that were 50-200S-1 and 2000-2500S-1, which can cause suddenly exchange for quantity of platelet adhered and other index (e.g PTT partical thromboplastin time). We suggested that rheological factors should be considered in evaluation of the interaction between biomaterials surface and blood, especially low shear rate (200S-1) and high shear rate (2000S-1). The ATP release of platelets had been detected using a Whole Blood Lumi-Aggregometer type 500 VS (Chrono-Log Corporation, Havertown, PA USA). The reaction was induced by the agents ADP, arachidonic acid, ristocetin and coliagen. At first the phenomenon was tested in 7 children with immune thrombocytopenia in the acute state with diminished plateiet count. In 6 cases under ADP a very tremendous release occured, in one child under arachidonic acid as well. With other agents only weak reactions had been observed or they failed at nil. After normalization the platelet count normal reactions were found. And in patients with thrombocytopenias of other cause the same abnormal constellation of findings had been observed. Adding plasma from thrombocytopenic individuais to constant amounts of normal whoie biood a hindrance of the reaction by ADP, arachidonic acid and coiiagen was achieved, in most cases in a quantitative manner. But the same hindrance occured after addition of normal plasma to constant amounts of blood from healthy persons. In other test combinations the normal whoie biood had been diIuted with saline or normal plasma, even with the proband's own plasma reducing the number of platelets. In these cases ADP provoked an tremendous release as was observed in the thrombocytopenic patients. Thus the hindrance and the enhancement as well must be taken for non-specific phenomena. It needs further standardization of the test for quantitative statements urgently.",

Adding plasma from thrombocytopanic individuals to constant amounts of normal whole blood a hindrance of the reaction by ADP, arechidonic acid and collagen was achieved, in most cases in a quantitative manner. But the same hindrance occured after addition of normal plasma to constant amounts of blood from healthy persons. In other test combinations thenormal whole blood had been diluted with saline or normal plasma, even with the proband's own plasma reducing the number of platelets.

We tested 52 women immediately after a spontaneous abortion, No woman had a history of repeated miscarriage. In order to confirm the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, we performed tissue thromboplastin Inhibition tests with Thromborel S | and mixing studies basing on the kaolin clotting time of platelet poor plasma. To avoid false negative test results concerning lupus anticoagulant, plasma samples were not frozen and thawn but were immediately tested, None of our patients showed any evidence of a lupus anticoagulant. In contrast to patients suffering from repeated miscarriage, lupus anticoagulant does not seem to be of major significance in patients with single abortion, Lupus anticoagulants are known to induce an increased risk of thromboembolic diseases and recurrent fetal loss. Placental dysfunction due to placental thrombosis is thought to be the leading cause of fetal loss, but only very few histologic examinations have yet been published. We here report on a woman with recurrent fetal loss and and well documented placental alterations. Generalized livedo racemosa is a rare disorder and is often accompanied by ischemic cerebrovascular disease (Sneddon's syndrome). Although clinical signs are well defined, the pathogenesis of this disorder is still obscure. It has recently been suggested that certain antiphospholipid antibodies (i.e. anticardiolipin antibodies, ACA) are associated with livedo racemosa. To evaluate antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with this disorder we examined 10 patients with Sneddon's syndrome.",

As so long as no trauma has occured or surgery has been carded out, inherent and acquired haemostaseological dzsorders may be clinica/ly inconspicuous, h is therefore important to perform a detailed diagnostic shedule prior to surgical intervention.

Therefore we wolud like to present two patients with this rare disorder: 1) A 32 year-old, indian pregnant woman who had never experienced any bleeding episodes, was reffered to our outpatient-clinic at time of 30. week of gestation to clarify prolongend aPTT, decreased PT and idiopathic thrombocytopenia (mean thrombocytc counts 90.000). Coagulation studies at this time showed reduced F.V and F.VIII levels (one and two stage assay) of 13% and 42 %, respectively. Despite prophylactic FFP-and immungiobulin infusions, severe bleeding complications have occurred during and after the labour. Further ne FFP substitutions could not be administerde because of severe anaphylactic reaction. Stabilisation of the circulation and cessation of bleeding could not reached until 15 hours post partum. Again bleeding from episiotomia wound was observed 12 days post partum, but sustituion therapy was not necessary. The born, healthy girl has no signs of coagulation disorders. 2) A 2 year-old boy had had an extremely, unexplained cranial haematoma after fracture of vault of the cranium. He is a turkish child of consanguineous parents who had no own or familial history of bleeding episodes or coagulation disorders. Coagulation studies showed reduced F.V and F.VIII levels (one and two stage assay) of 16% and 13 %, respectively. Since this event he is suffering from recurrent severe bleeding episodes, which can be treated with Haemate HS. In both patients patterns of multimers, F VIII C:Ag, Risto CoF, bleeding time, Prot.C and Prot.S were within normal ranges. Pathological inhibiters (FV-, FVIII-inhibitor or Lupus anticoagulants) were not detected. In both patients no signs of liver or malignant diseases or DIC were found. We would like to discuss the clinical picture, therapy and further laboratory analysis of the presented combined F.V/F.VIII deftciencies in detail. In both groups the patients with acute or subacute thrombosis (< 4 weeks) demonstrated significantly higher levels of fibrinogen (fib), alpha-2-antiplasmin (a2-apl), alpha-l-proteinase-inhibitor (a1-PI) and alpha-l-antichymotrypsin (al-act) compared to the patients with postthrombotic syndrome (>4 weeks). In the adult group, there was also a significant difference in the levels of vWF and C1-inh. In the children's group, the differences were also present, but were not statistically slgnlticant. The a2-macroglobulin-levels did not demonstrate any relationship to thrombus age in either group (table).

Post partum factor VIII inhibitors are rare but potentially life-threatening. 50 cases (including two own cases) have been published and were analyzed with regard to clinical features, laboratory results, efficacy of treatment and prognosis. The median age of the patients was 27 years. The inhibitor developed after the first delivery in 21 cases, in 6 after the second, in 3 after the third, in further 3 beyond the 4th delivery. In the majority cases (76%) the onset of symptoms was within 3 months after delivery, in 2 cases the inhibitor appeared after 12 months and in 2 other cases already during pregnancy. 3/4 had inhibitor titers above 5 BU/ml and I/4 above 500 BU/m]. A Kaplan Meier analysis revealed that the probability of complete remission (no bleeding tendency and normal clotting assays) was 50% at 20 and 80% at 36 months. The time to complete remission was shorter in patients who received Azathioprine or Cyclophosphamide (with or without steroids) compared to steroids alone or no treatment. The probability of surviva] at 5 years is 70%. These data indicate that the long term prognosis in post partum inhibitors is favourable independent of treatment, but treatment with immune suppressive drugs seems to accelerate recovery. -Since these data were obtained by retrospective analysis caution in the interpretation is necessary. The prevalence of protein S deficiency (which has an autosomal dominant inheritance) in adolescent patients is about 8%. The first manifestation rarely occurs before the 10th year of life, and mostly takes place between the 20th and 35th year of life. An isolated protein S deficiency was first diagnosed in 14 elderly patients from eleven families from January 1990 to June 1992. The age of these patients was between 60 and 75 years. The median protein S activity was 37% and the median protein S concentration was 44%. The other clotting parameters were within the reference range. Clinically, eight patients showed fresh thrombembolic events and three patients reported pulmonary infarcts in the history. A further three patients had so far remained asymptomatic. The presence of a first manifestation of an inhibitor defect should thus be considered, even in elderly patients. The present study was performed to investigate the behaviour of sTMD in patients with DVT undergoing thrombolytic therapy (TT). 13 patients with DVT who underwent TT with high-dose streptokinase were included, sTMD was measured using an ELISA at the time of admission, 24 h after starting TT and after finishing therapy. Normal values were obtained from healthy blood donors (mean 14.2 ng/ml; range 7.5 21.5 ng/ml). Except one (29.3 ng/m\u2022 all patients had normal sTMD concentrations ranging from 8.5 to 18.5 ng/ml at the time of admission. During streptokinase treatment different patterns of sTMD evolution were observed, sTMD decreased in 6 cases, remained almost unchanged in 4 cases and increased in 3 cases. At the end of TT, sTMD values were restored in 7 patients whereas in 4 patients increased values were detected. 2 patients demonstrated decreased sTMD concentrations. No correlation could be found between sTMD values and localization and extent of DVT as well as clinical outcome.",

Also activation of clotting factors induced by adding kaolin to the plasma was markedly reduced by the synthetic inhibitors. We hypothesized that the coagulation activation occurring during thrombolytic therapy, which results in a transient procoagnlant state that probably contributes to failure to recanalize or to rethrombosis of the reperfused artery, might be due to an inhibitory effect of plasmin on the anticoagulant properties of protein C. We therefore studied the effect of plasmin on protein C (PC) and activated protein C (APC) using purified human proteins. As measured by a specific chromogenic substrate assay, incubation of PC with plasmin resulted in rapid activation of PC with subsequent inactivation, with the rates depending on the concentration of plasmin. Incubation of 240 nmol/L PC with 40, 400 and 2000 nmol/L plasmin generated 55, 48 and 38 nmol/L APC in 15, 5 and 1 minutes, respectively. Plasmin-generated APC declined to baseline level after 60 minutes for 400 and after 20 minutes for 2000 nmol/L plasmin. Not more than approximately 20% of the PC was activated, suggesting that besides inactivating the APC that had been generated, plasmin might have simultaneously degraded the zymogen form of PC. SDS-PAGE using 125I-labelled proteins demonstrated that the functional inactivation was indeed accompanied by plasmininduced proteolytic degradation of both PC and APC. The rates of activation and subsequent inactivation were slowed by the presence of CaC12, which prevented the degradation of APC by plasmin, but not the degradation of PC. These results suggest a previously unrecognized link between the fibrinolyfic and the PC pathway. The plasmin-induced impairment of the protein C-mediated negative feedback loop for thrombin generation might be of therapeutic relevance considering the thrombin generation associated with thrombolytic therapy. In 20 asymptomatic patients (pts) (14 f, 6 m, mean age 26.8_+18.1 years) with hereditary protein C (PC) and 24 pts (18 f, 6 m, mean age 24.8_+10.1 years) with hereditary protein S (PS) deficiency diagnosis of the deficiency state was made at an age of at least 14 years due to family studies of symptomatic deficient patients. These 44 pts were prospectively followed and compared with 49 asymptomatic nondeficient relatives (20 with PC-, 29 with PS-deficiency). The mean observation period was 5.9 years for PC-deficient and 3.9 years for PS-deficient pts. Patients were not regularly treated with anticoagulants unless a high risk situation was present. During the observation period in 6 pts 8 thromboembolic events (1 PE, 1 PE + DVT, 3 DVT, 1 caval vein thrombosis, 2 superficial vein thrombosis) occurred. The incidence of thromboembolic events was calculated to be 2.5%/patient year for PC-deficiency, and 3.2% for PS-deficiency. In the controls, no thromboembolic events occurred. 4 events occurred spontaneously, in 2 pts thromboembolic events were triggered by high risk situations (ceserean section, minor trauma). One major and 4 minor uneventful operations were carried out using heparin prophylaxis. 1/7 pregnancies was complicated by PE after ceserean section. Conclusions: This prospective study proves that pts with PC-and PSdeficiency are at an increased risk of thrombosis. Prophylactic treatment was highly effective in most high risk situations in preventing thromboembolism, most of the fife-threatening thromboembolic events occured spontaneously. In a family with hereditary type I protein C deficiency over 3 generations the underlying DNA abnormality has been investigated.",

Since inherited deficiencies of PC or its cofactor protein S ere both associated with severe thrombophilia, it has been speculated that deficiency in TM should be although a risk factor for thrombophilia. The localization of TM within the EC membrane, however, makes functional analysis of TM in plasma samples impossible, although TM antigen has been identified in plasma. The soluble TM antigen represents a heterogenous mixture of proteolyticeily degraded TM fragments with low or even absent TM activity. 'Therefore this source of TM is not useful to determine TM activity. Recently, intact TM molecules have been ideritified in megakaryocytes and plateiets. Thns, we postulate that platelets could be an eiternative source for determination of TM activity. Usually, TM activity is determined by a cell surface assay measuring the rate of PC activation through thromblrl/TM complexes. Since incubation of platelets with thrombin will result in immediate platelef plug formation, this approach is nat usetul to determine TM actMty m platelets. [o overcome trtis problem, a TM activity assay using ceil lysates was developed. Cultured EC were used as positive control ceils to evaluate the optimal assay conditions as well as the sensitivity and specificity of this functional TM assay. A high salt lysis buffer containing the detergent Triton )(-100 was found to be the most effective solubllizer to release TM from the membrence without losing TM activity. The detection limit of the TM assay was 1 ng TM/ml lysate. The coefficients of intra-and inter-assey variations were 5.4% and 6.1%, respectively. The TM specifity of the assay was determined by inhibiting studies using polyelenal antibodies directed against TM. Using this approach, TM activity has been demonstrated in the megakeryoblastic cell line MEG-01 and in gel-filtered plateiets. UnsUmulated platelets revealed a concentration of 65 molecules TM per plateiet. The data presented demonstrate that determination of TM activity is possible in ceil lysates. Most importantly, however, this approach offers the possibility to analyse TM activity in patients. A bispecific antibody with specificities for both, the amino terminus of the fibrin B-chain and the platelet receptor GP IIb/IIIa was synthesized by conjugating irninothiolanemodified antifibrin monoclonal antibody (59D8) to a pyridyldithio-modified antiplatelet monoclonal antibody (7E3). Alternatively, a bispecific (Fab')2 was synthesized from the respective antibody Fab-fragments. The bispecific antibody or bispecific (Fab')2 was purified from uncoupled antibody or Fab' fragments of either specificity by gel chromatography over Sepharose S-300 and subsequently coupled to pyridyldithio-modified urokinase. The resulting antffzbrin-antzp\" iatelet-drokinase conjugate (59D8-7E3-UK) was purified by double affinity chromatography using using B-chain-peptide Sepharose and benzamidine-Sepharose as matrices. The conjugate was compared at equal amidolytic activities (S-2444) with the monospecific conjugates 59D8-UK and 7E3-UK as well as with an uncoupled mixture of bispecific antibody and urokinase (59D8-7E3 + UK) and native urokinase (UK). 59D8-7E3-UK was shown to brad to immobilized fibrin as well as 59D8-UK and to immobilized IIb/IIIa almost as well as 7E3-UK. In lysing platelet-rich and fibrin-rich clots in a quantitative assay in plasma the 59D8-7E3-UK was shown to be similar in efficacy to the appropriate monospecific conjusate but superior to the monospecific conjugate lacking its target molecule in the clot. 59D8-7E3-UK was also more effective than 59D8-7E3 + UK or uncoupled UK alone. Thus, a molecular construct may contain two different thrombns directed targeting functions providing possible advantages over targeting to fibrin or a platelet receptor alone.",

            "text": "In conclusion, BM 06.022 seems to be a safe and relatively fibrin selecti?e thrombolytic agent although the hemostatic imbalance induced by bolus application is more pronounced than with native t-PA. Due to the deletion of 3 N-terminal domains (F, G, Kl-domain) and the lack of glycosylation (expression in E. colD, its half life is about 4 times longer compared to native t-PA. There is increasing evidence from several prospective studies for the role of fibrinogen as a coronary risk marker. The strong correlation of fibdnogen and inflammation and the association to age, obesity, diabetes meititus, smoking and use of OC is generally accepted, whereas the genetic contdbution is still inclined to controversy. By means of the polymerase chain reaction we amplified DNA fragments which included the cutting site of the restriction enzymes designated Haelll and Hindlll. We detected two alleles for each enzyme (Hal and Ha2; Hi1 and Hi21. Since the cleavage site of the enzyme Bcll -which is supposed to have the greatest impact on fibrinogen concentration -is still unknown, attempts to synthesize suitable pdmers failed, 377 male and 62 female survivors of myocardial infarction were investigated, showing a mean fibdnogen of 3.36 + 0.87 g/I (men) and 3.74 + 1.04 g/I (women). A small but significant increase was found depending on the genotypes in men: HalHal: 3.28 + 0.89 g/I (n=228), HalHa2:3.45 + 0.86 (n=134), Ha2Ha2:3.58 + 0.63 (n= 15) (p=0.04); HilHil: 3.28 + 0.89 g/I (n = 227), Hi1 Hi2:3.45 + 0.86 in= 135), Hi2Hi2:3.58 + 0,63 (n= 15} (p=0.04). The nearly identical results for Haelll and Hindlll show the existence of linkage disequilibrium between the two sites. There was only one patient with different genotypes as to both polymorphisms. In women we could not detect a significant difference, presumably because of two low numbers of individuals in the three groups. However, there was an increase of 7.7% from HAIHal to Ha 1 Ha2, Hal Hal: 3.65 + 0.82 g/I (n=35), HalHa2:3.93 + 1.32 (n=24), Ha2Ha2:3.31 + 0.72 (n= 3) (p--n.s.}; the results for Hindlll were only slightly different. Rabbit endothelial cells in culture synthesize a peculiar heparan sulfate rich in trisulfated disaccharide, a typical unit of the heparin molecule (Nader, et aL, Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 84:3565, 1987 ). This heparan sulfate was shown to possess anticoagulant activity. Recently, it has been shown that heparin has an effect on the synthesis of this heparan sulfate (Nader, et al., J Cell Physio1140:305, 1989 . These results led us to investigate the effect of several LMW heparins [CY 216, CY 222, (Sanofi/Choay Institut, France), OP 622, OP 386 (Opocrin Labs, Italy), PK 10169 (Pharmuka Labs, France), Oligo II (prepared by heparitinase II digestion)], as well as other glycosaminoglycans and their synthetic analogues [suleparoid (Syntex, Argentina), LW 10082 (lactobionic acid, Luitpold Pharma, Germany) chemically modified heparins, GAGPS, MPS, dextran sulfate (Sigma)] upon the endothelial cells. The results have shown that endothelial cells respond to the administration of these antithrombotic agents by producing increased amounts of this peculiar heparan sulfate. In addition, these agents, like the intact heparin molecule, led to a change in the sulfation pattern of the heparan sulfate, enhancing the relative amount of the trisulfated disaccharide which is typical of the heparan structure. The observed effect was specific for heparan sulfate synthesis, since the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and sulfated glycoproteins was not affected. Furthermore, this increased heparan synthesis was independent of AT-Ill affinity. These combined results lead to the hypothesis that the antithrombotic actions of LMW heparins and related glycosaminoglycans and their synthetic analogues may be due to the stimulation of endogenous synthesis of heparan sulfate. Tissue factor 0\"F) is the major cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascade. It functions as a high affinity receptor for plasma factors VII and Vlla. Under inflammatory conditions, TF can be induced by Tumor Necrosis Factor ct (TNFct) to be expressed on monocytes end vascular endothelial cells. It has been implicated, that TF is involved in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic diseases. To study the mechanism of signal transduction by TNFtz-mediated TF expression, we cloned the TF gene including 1.5 kb of 5\"-flanking region. Promoter activity of the 5\"-flanking region and the regulation thereof were studied in primary endothelial cells, NIH 3T3 and HeLa cell lines using Chloramphenicolacetyltransferase (CAT) as a reporter gene. In all cells studied, the region comprising -255 upstream nucleotides support transcriptional activity and can be divided into distinct regions: The region-255 to-194 exhibited high promoter activity, and the region -194 to +14 was associated with a 24-fold lower minimal promoter activity. TNFa stimulation of ~ransfected NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells enhanced (4-fold) only the promoter activity of the region -255 to +14 containing two activator protein 1 (AP-1) consensus sequences. In addition, experiments using a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter fused to a fragment containing these two AP-1 sequences showed a 7fold increase of promoter activity in transfected HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells and a 3-fold enhanced activity during TNF~ stimulation. DNase I protection assays using nuclear extracts of endothelial and HeLa cells end the purified transcription factor Jun revealed two protected regions between -231 and -202, which are homologous to the AP-1 sequence. Based on the functional studies and DNase I protection assays, we conclude that the cis-acting element AP-1 and its related binding proteins (AP-1/Jun) are involved in normal and TNFcc-dependent regulation of TF gene expression. In human falciparum malaria, procoagulant alterations correlate with disease severity in vivo. In vitro, patient serum upregolates tissue factor (TF) expression by cultured endothelial cells (EC). In order to assess the in vivo relevance of increased TF expression, we determined TF levels in the plasma of 47 patients with faleiparum malaria. Plasma and serum samples were obtained before (=day 0) and after (days 1, 2, 4, 7) antiparasitic therapy. Eleven (of 47) patients had organ complications. -TF levels were determined by sandwich ELISA. In addition, the capacity of patient serum to induce TF activity in cultured EC was assessed functionally (TF on the EC surface shortens the recalcification time of pooled normal plasma.) In most patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, TF levels remained within normal range during therapy. In complicated disease, however, TF levels rose up to 8 times the initial values by day 4 or 7. The capacity of serum samples to induce \"IF activity in cultured EC, in contrast, was highest at day 0. Interestingly, the \"IF inducing capacity at day 0 correlated with TF plasma levels at days 4 and 7 (r = 0.64, p < 0.01}. Thus, it seems that in human falciparum malaria, TF is first expressed, and then -in the course of antiparasitic treatment -shedded into circulation. In our patients, circulating TF turns out to be a marker of disease severity even several days after the start of treatment. In order to elucidate the procoagulant and thrombogenic effects of a recombinant tissue factor (r-TF) characterized earlier (Bach et al., Biochemistry 25:4007-4020, 1986) we utilized a modified clotting assay for the in vitro procoagulant studies. A standardized model of rabbit jugular vein stasis thrombosis (Fareed et al., Semin Thromb Hemost 11 (2):155-175, 1985) was used to study the thrombogenic effects of r-TF and ex vivo blood analyses (AP'I-f, PT, 5 Unit \"IT, Heptest, TEG and ACT). Recombinant TF reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles was evaluated in a modified clotting time assay in normal rabbit plasma (NRP), normal human plasma (NHP) and graded dilutions of factor deficient human plasmas (factors I, II, V, VII, IX, X, XlI, Fletcher and Fitzgerald). Recombinant TF was diluted serially to obtain 100 -6.1 ng/ml solutions in 0.025M CaCI 2. A concentration dependent clotting effect was observed in the NRP and the NHP when these dilutions of r-TF were utilized in place of thromboplastin C in the PT assay. At a r-TF concentration of 50 ng/ml the clotting times for both NHP and NRP were around 25 seconds. At 50 ng/ml r-TF, the various factor deficient plasmas gave varying clotting times (25 ->300 seconds) in the same assay. To study the thrombogenic effect of r-TF, this agent was administered to rabbits at a graded dose range of 100 -3.1 ng/kg via intravenous route. Right and left jugular vein segments were ligated after 20 seconds for 10 and 20 minutes respectively. Clots formed in these segments were graded in a standardized manner on a 0 -4 scale. Electron microscopic analysis of the representative thrombi revealed platelet-poor, fibrin rich clots containing entrapped cellular elements. Recombinant TF produced a dose-dependent thrombotic effect with an apparent EDso of 25 ng/kg for both 10 and 20 minutes stasis time. In comparison to other thrombogenic agents such as prothrombin complex concentrates, the ex vivo analyses of r-TF treated animals did not reveal any shortening of the clotting times (AP'FI', PT, 5 Unit TT and Heptest were unaffected). Furthermore, the results of the thrombelastographic (TEG) and Activated Clotting Time (ACT) assays revealed a dose-dependent hypocoagulant response in the whole blood after r-TF treatment. These results indicate that r-TF is a potent thrombogenic agent, however the in vivo results do not correlate with the ex vivo plasma and whole blood results. We developed a solid-phase chromogenic assay for the quantitation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). After immobilisation of microtitar plates (Nunc, Denmark) for 20 hours at 4~ a commercial thromboplastin (Odho Brain, Ortho Diagnostic, Milan) is incubated for one hour with 1 U/ml of a prothrombin complex concentrate (Protromplex, Irnmuno, Pisa). After washing, generated Factor Xa activity is measured by a chromogenic substrate (S-2222, Ortho Diagnostic, Milan) . Factor Xa generation is progressively inhibited by increasing amounts (1-12 pl) of serum or heated (56~ 30 rain) plasma, or by recombinant TFPI (1-5ng/ml). inhibition by serum or plasma is abolished by anti-TFPI policlonal antibodies. Plasma levels of TFPI in 21 normal subjects (M=8; F=-13) were found to be 98.1 \u2022 19 1% of pooled nnrmal plasma, with an infr~-~.d !nter ss~sy coefficient o! variation of 8.9 and 9.8%, respectively. Plasma levels of TFPI were found to be normal in fO women at the end of their pregnancy or in 10 patients under anticoagulant therapy, and significantly increased in 10 patients with chronic liver disease and in 10 patients with unexplained juvenile thrombosis. In a randomized study on 18 patients with cardiovascular disease subcutaneously administered standard and low-molecular weight (CY216) haparins induced a comparable increase in TFPI plasma levels. The availability of a simple assay to measure TFPI not requiring purified coagulation factors may facilitate studies of the patho-physiological role of the inhibitor. Heparin as well as heparin fractions release tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) into the blood stream after intravenous and subcutaneous injection. The half-life of TFPI release after intravenous injection is about 60 min and no differences are observed for heparin and heparin fractions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis of a specific release of TFPI for heparins. Therefore, we have studied the effect of low molecular weight dermatan sulphate (LMW-DES) in comparison to low molecular weight heparin after intravenous injection of 2 different doses of each compound. 100 mg and 200 mg of LMW-DES and 50 mg and 100 mg of a heparin fraction were injected intravenously into 10 volunteers per group. The maximal release of TFPI was 1.5 and 1.7 units YFPI/mi plasma with 100 mg and 200 mg LMW-DES, respectively. 40 mg and 100 nag heparin fraction released 3.8 and 4.1 U TFPI/ml plasma, respectively. TFPI levels returned within the normal range in 30 min after administration of LMW-DES whereas TFPI declined with the half-life of 60 rain after application of the heparin fraction.",

It is concluded that heparios bind to TFPI releasing thereby the inhibitor from its receptor site. A specific heparin binding sequence of the TFPI may be concluded from these interaction studies. TFPI activities and activation markers of the coagulation system were prospectively evaluated in pts. with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; FAB MI-M6) undergoing treatment with intensive chemotherapy. A total of 50 pts. were recruited for the study. Blood sampling was started before chemotherapy and repeated every 4 days. When body temperature exceeded 38.5~ blood was obtained on days 1-2-4-7-11 of the febrile episode, ii pts. did not develop fever at all (group 1 (GI)), 31 pts. had one or more febrile episodes (G2), 3 pts. fulfilled the criteria solely for sepsis syndrome (G3) and 5 pts. had septic shock (G4+5) according to the definition given by Glauser et al (Lancet 1991; 338:732) . 2 out of 5 pts. with septic shock survived (G4), whereas the remaining 3 pts. died of septic complications (GS). TFPI levels significantly decreased at the onset of fever in pts. with sepsis syndrome/septic shock, whereas they remained unaffected in un-eventful febrile episodes (G2) and non-febrile courses (GI). Following the initial decrease, TFPI activity rose in response to prolonged febrile challenge. The drop in TFPI levels was accompanied by a significant increase in prothrombin fragment 1+2 and thrombin-antithrombin complexes. These data suggest that septicaemia in contrast to uncomplicated fever in neutropenic pts. is associated with a transient decrease in TFPI activity paralleled by a simultaneous increase in thrombin generation. The non-specific, heparin-binding serine protease inhibitor (serpin) protein C inhibitor (PCI) interacts with its target proteases by forming inactive stable 1:1 complexes. Heparin stimulates most PCI/protease reactions, but inhibits the tissue kallikrein / PCI-interaction by a hitherto unknown mechanism. In this study we analyzed the inibitory effect of heparin on the tissue kallikrein / PCI interaction in more detail: Only free PCI and the tissue kallikrein / PCI complex bound to heparin-sepharose and were eluted at 0. Desmodus rotundus. DSPAco is an effective thrombolytic agent being more potent and more fibrin specific than t-PA (Witt et al., Blood 79:1213 -1217 , 1992 . In a static system clots formed by addition of calcium and thromboplastin to human whole blood were incubated for 180 min with DSPAco and t-PA in plasma. The concentration range leading to complete thrombolysis was similar for both plasminogen activators with lysis times of 92+ 9min and 110+ 11min for 30 nM DSPAc~I and t-PA respectively (means + SEM, n=9). The t-PA concentration response curve reversed at 30 nM. Plasma fibrinogen fell to the detection limit with t-PA, while up to 100 nM DSPAco, fibrinogenolysis did not occur. We studied the thrombolytic activity of DSPAal and t-PA in a pressure system using a hydrostatic gradient to induce plasma flow through a clot m~=trix formed in a fibrir~ogen coated polystyrene tube by addition of calcium and thromboplastin to human whole blood. At 50 cm H20 the time to clot canalisation was more rapid than at 30 cm H20. Canalisation occurred for 30 nM DSPAal and t-PA after 41+5rain and 44+3min at 30 cm H20, and 23+2min and 26 + 2 min at 50 cm H20 (means + SEM, n=8) respectively. The t-PA concentration response curve plateaued off at higher concentrations. Clot finding of DSPAal under flow resembled that of t-PA t-PA and DSPAco effectively lyse human whole blood clots. Plasminemia with t-PA as indicated by fibrinogenolysis also limits its efficacy ('plasminogen steal'). Lysis of adhesive blood clots in a tubular system similar to a blood vessel is dependent on pressure which determines the flow carrying the ptasminogen activator into the clot. Both PA's are equipotent under different pressure conditions. Their fibrin affinity under flow conditions is also similar, while 'plasminogen steal' even with of flow and short incubation periods may limit the time to lysis achievable with t-PA.",

High concentrations of PCI are found in seminal plasma. Since its role in the male reproductive system is unknown, we analyzed possible interactions of PCI with serine proteases present in semen. We have shown previously that purified urinary PCI inhibited purified boar acrosin with an apparent second order rate constant of 5.8xt04M-ls -1 (Zheng XL et ah 1st International Symposium on Hormones and Haemostasis, Essen, Germany 1992). In this study we can show that purified urinary PCI also inhibits the amidolytic activity of human sperm extracts. Using immunoeytochemical techniques (rabbit anti-PCI IgG followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex), PCI antigen was detected in some spermatozoa (less than 1%). By electron microscopy using rabbit anti-PCI IgG and gold labeled antirabbit IgG, PCI antigen was found in the acrosome. The presence of PCI-urokinase (uPA) and PCI-tissue kallikrein (TK) complexes in seminal plasma was analyzed using ELISAs specific for these complexes: monoclonal IgG against PCI or TK was immobilized on a microtiter plate and following incubation with the samples, bound uPA-PCI or TK-PCI complexes were quantified with a peroxidase-linked moaoclo-Hal antibody to uPA or PCI, respectively. Using these assays, we found that uPA-PCI and TK-PCI complexes were present in the seminal plasma from normal donors. These results, together with data showing that PCI forms a complex with prostate specific antigen in seminal plasma (Espafia F et ah Thromb Res 1991) , suggest that PCI inhibits many proteases present in semen. One of its physiological functions might be the protection of surrounding tissues and/or spermatozoa from proteolytie damage by serine proteases present in the male reproductive system. ",

VN mediates RGD-dependent cell adhesion and plays an important regulatory role in the immune system and in haemostasis. Initial plasmin cleavage of VN generates a 61 kDa fragment which lacks binding sites for heaprin and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-l, but displays enhanced binding for plasminogen. To further characterize its structure and biological functions, we isolated the intermediate 61 kDa plasmin cleavage product by anion exchange chromotography. Treatment of the 61 kDa fragment as well as a synthetic 15-mer peptide derived from its carboxy-terminus with carboxypeptidase B drastically reduced binding to plasminogen. These results indicate the involvement of a critical carboxy-terminal lysine in plasminogen binding, a structural motif found in other plasminogen-binding proteins. The isolated 61 kDa fragment mediated adhesion to cells, bearing the VN receptor ~8~ in a timeand concentration-dependent manner similar to intact VN, whereas the fragment lacked the ability to muitimerize. Prolonged plasmin degradation of VN revealed loss of the epitope for monoclonal antibody 8E6 which occured earlier with multimeric VN. Finally, the major proteolysis products were a 35 kDa fragment for plasma VN and a 40 kDa fragment for multimeric VN. The occurance of both fragments correlated well with total loss in cell adhesive function. Our findings indicate that partial plasmin proteolysis may convert VN from an anti-into a profibrinolytic component, and that ongoing proteolysis destroys the RGDdependent attachment domain. We suggest that these mechanisms are transiently operative at cell-matrix sites where pericellular proteolysis has to be strictly regulated.",

In contrast to plasma VN, the heparin-binding form of VN bound to immobilized collagen type I and BM-40 in a saturable manner with half maximal binding at 2-3 x 10\" M and 3-4 x 10\" M, respectively. In a concentration-depandent manner CaCI z as well as heparin interfered with VN-binding to collagen type I and BM-40, with half maximal inhibition at 0.5 mM and < 1.5 i~g/ml, respectively. In competition experiments with synthetic peptides derived from the heparin-binding domain of VN, interaction between BM-40 and VN was totally blocked. This finding represents a novel mechanism, in which protein-protein interactions are mediated by the heparin-binding domain of VN. The respective complementary binding site in BM-40 is proposed to be a CaZ*-binding domain. Our results implicate that due to specific interaction between BM-40 and VN via defined binding sites various functional properties of both proteins in the haemostasis system may become modulated, particularly in the subendothelium. Apolipoprotein (a) is genetically polymorphic. This polymorphism accounts for inter-individual heterogeneity of Lp(a). We demonstrate that there is tremendous heterogeneity of Lp(a) particles unrelated to the genetic apo(a) polymorphism. Plasma was separated by fast flow gel filtration. Elution of Lp(a) was monitored with 4 enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Polyclonal anti-apo(a) was used on the solid phase. Tracer antibodies were as follows: 1. anti-apoB; 2. anti-apo(a); 3. monoclonal anti-apoB (MB3, M19, MB47); 4. monoclonal anti-apoE. EIA analyses in the column eluate revealed that Lp(a) size isomorphs differed by their apo(a) to apoB ratio, the relative proportion of apo(a) decreasing in parallel with the molecular weight of Lp(a) complexes. Immunoblottlng of column fractions obtained a complex pattern with a vast number of bands smaller than the major apo(a) isoforms. In parallel with decreasing molecular weights of Lp(a), the distribution of these bands was shifted towards lower molecular weights. The ~ ofiles for MB3 and MB47 immunoreactivity coincided, but B19 immunoreactivity peaked at a higher molecular weight than MB3 or MB47. Thus, the ratio MB47/MB19 increased as the size of Lp(a) decreased. Lower molecular weight Lp(a) particles contained apoE. To elucidate the functional significance of Lp(a) heterogeneity, we studied binding, internalization and degradation of small and large Lp(a) particles in fibroblasts, endothelial cells and rat mesangial cells. These experiments showed that Lp(a) can interact with LDL-receptors (LDL-R) and at least one cellular site other than the LDL-R. Smaller Lp(a) preferentially bound to LDL-R, whereas larger Lp(a) were directed to non-LDL-R routes. The interaction of large Lp(a) with the non-LDL-R sites was b~locked by excess cold plasminogen. We suggest that more than one cellular site is in involved in Lp(a) catabolism and that these sites can distinguish between circulating Lp(a) isomorphs.",

Internalized 125-l-fibrin, characterized as cell-associated radioactivity resistant to proteolytic degradation, was generally only temporarily detectable between two and eight hours after application. Studies with centrifuged platelets revealed the requirement of a plasma factor for the binding of 125-I-fibrin. The reaction was inhibited by hirudin, D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH 2 C1 or heparin. The plasma factor was purified by various steps including adsorption onto barium citrate. It migrated in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions identical with prothrombin. Authentic prothrombin also mediated binding of 125-I-fibrin to centrifuged platelets and improved internalization by a thrombocyte concentrate. Inhibition studies suggested that prothrombin first is converted at the platelet surface to thrombin which is the direct mediator of fibrin binding. Failure of inhibiting the platelet-fibrin interaction by RGD-peptides or by an antibody directed against the GPIIb/IIIa-complex suggests that this transmembrane complex is not involved in fibrin clearance. We investigated the presence of tPA-binding proteoglycans (PG) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Roughly 6% of total radioactivity, present in the cell extract of [35S] labelled HUVEC, could be eluted from DFP treated tPA-Sepharose 4B. No binding was observed using a BSA-Sepharose 4B. Using an urea electrophoresis [35]S radioactivity revealed one major signal with a Mr between 600 to 750 kDa (PG-A). Two additional bands were visible ranging from 340 to 440 (PG-B) and 120 to 180 kDa (PG-C). Preincubation of the eluted material with glycosaminoglycan (GAGIdigesting enzymes followed by PAGE showed that heparan sulfate like PG are the major GAG in the elated material. Incubation of the material with heparitinase inhibited also rebinding of eluted material to tPA-Sepharose 4B, supporting that the major carbohydrate component of the PG responsible for the interaction with tPA might be composed of heparan sulfate. This was confirmed by testing the rebinding behaviour after nitrous acid degradation which was nearly abolished. Beparin, arginine and lysine, but not glycine, EACA and aspartic acid were effective agents to inhibit rebinding of eluted material to tPA-Sepharose 4B. Elution of rebound material was possible with the same components which were active as inhibitors of rebinding. Our results suggest that binding of tPA to HUVEC might be mediated by heparan sulfate-like PG, which may function as a storage pool for tPA that can be depleted by plasma heparin. Clinical Experimental Physiology, University of Vienna The exact diagnosis and classification of von Willebrand-disease(vWD) is important for the prophylaxis and therapy of bleeding complications. In our patients diagnosis was made beside by ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (optical method), ristocetin-cofactor (Behring) and Factor VIII-related antigen (immune electrophoresis) by a new method of multimeric analysis according to B. P~tzsch et al. (Thromb. Haemostas., submitted) , including vertical agarose-polyacrylamideelectrophoresis, Western-blotting and detection with peroxidase-linked antibodies. In 82 patients with a clinical suspicion, a vWD could be confirmed in 39 patients by multimeric analysis. Type I was found in 30/39 (76,9 %), type III in 6/39 (15,4 %) and type II in 3/39 (7,7 %; IIA: 2; IIB: i). Introduction: Aqulred vWD is a rare disorder associated with angiodysplasia or malignant proliferative diseases. In the latter this disorder does not respond to treatment of the underlying disease. For the first time we report on a patient with a malignant lymphoma associated vWD which disappeared after BMT. Case report: The 48 year old woman suffering from lmmunocytoma (without paraproteinemia) received bone marrow from her HLA-identical, MLC-noareactive sister atier total body irradiation (TBI, 12Gy) and high dose IV Etoposide (60 mg/kg). Since diagnosis of her disease in 1986 she was interminingly treated with cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, prednisolon, vinblastin and, because of progressive disease, adriamycin, vincristin, bendamustin and methotrexate (MTX). Easy bruising and a sudden onset of severe epistaxis shortly after the lymphoma was discovered led to the diagnosis of vWD. Since she never had bleeding problems until 1986 and her family history did not indicate any congenital bleeding disorder her vWD must have been aquired. During the following period repeat bleeding episodes were controlled by infusion of cryoprezipitate. Three weeks before BMT an Hickman-catheter was inserted uneventfully after prophylactic therapy with FVIII/vWF concentrate (Haemate, Behringwerke). Despite prophylactic treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA) and a short course of MTX, on day *23 the patient developed skin-GVHD which responded fully to prednisoloa. BMT was followed by complete remission of the lymphoma and a gradual disappearance of the aquired vWD (see table) . Discussion: Although we do not know the underlying mechanism which led to the normalization of coagulation we suggest that eradication of the malignant lymphatic cell clone by high dose chemotherapy and TBI is the crucial event. The possibility that CSA is a contributing or even essential factor in this setting cannot be ruled out. Background: Release of ULvWF multimers by the endothelium thereby inducing platelet aggregation in the microcirculation has been implicated as one of the possible pathomechanisms of TMA Objective: To investigate 1) the effect of treatment of TMA on the vWF multimer composition and 2) whether reappearance in plasma of ULvWF multimers after therapy is associated with recurrence of the disease. Methods: Analysis of vWF mummers by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis in 6 patients with TMA before and at several timepoints during and after treatment with plasma exchange (60 ml/kg/d), methylprednisolone (0.75 mg/kg i.v. 2x daily) and vincristine (2 nag i.v. day 1, 1 nag days 4, 7 and 10). Results: At diagnosis absence of tl~e ~arge vWF muttimers was ~een in all patients. Treatment resulted in complete remission and in partial ren~ssion in 3 patients, respectively. Normal vWF multimers were found in 4/6 patients after successful therapy, Two of these patients died due to bone marrow transplantation-associated sepsis. In one patient, recurrence of the disease was twice proceeded by reappearance of ULvWF multimers in plasma and was successfully treated at both occasions. In one patient, ULvWF multimers were demonstrable at various time-points during therapy. Discontinuation of treatment was immediately followed by recurrence of the disease. Conclusion: ULvWF multimers may have a crucial role in the pathomechanism of TMA by inducing platelet aggregation and deposition of plafelet aggregates in the microeirculation. Reappearance of ULvWF multimers in plasma during or after therapy is associated with a high probability of recurrence of the disease.

The efficacy of the manufacturing process of IMMUNATE | to inactivate and reduce transrmssible pathogenic substances was reported by Barett et al. (1992) , HIV-I was reduced by a factor of>t015 and TBE virus by a factor of>1018. The excellem clinical efficacy of IMMUNATE | used for replacement therapy in hemophilia A patients was demonstrated by Zmamcrrnann et al. (1992) Purity is a main feature in discussions on the quality of FVIII concentrates. Conflicting data exist, either supporting or questioning its clinical relevance. The terms \"purity\" and \"impurities\" are not well defined. Specific activity describing the potency per amount of protein is an attractive parameter, but covers only the quantitative aspect. For instance, albumin added as a stabilizer and yon Willebrand factor (vWF) protein cannot be considered as contaminants, but would account for most of the protein in the calculation of specific activity for many concentrates. Whereas data are generally corrected for albumin content, vWF components are often ignored. VWF represents 99% of the molecular weight of an intact FVIII molecule with 10 p.g/ml plasma as compared to only 1% for the FVIII:C component with 0.1 p.g/mi plasma (Furie & Furie, 1988) . A product with a v .~.~Ag._/FVI!!:C ratio of 1:1 (as in plasma) may theoretically reach a specific activity of no more than 100 IU/mg total protein, where all the protein represents FVIII. For a product in which the vWFAg has been reduced to a ratio of 0.hl, the maximum specific activity would rise to above 900 IU/mg. The vWFAg/FVIII:C ratios of presently available concentrates have been shown to vary by a factor of 100, so that the vWFAg content has a great impact on the value of specific activity given for an individual preparation. Thus, specific activity values are misleading when used for comparing purity of FVIII concentrates. Although it is unclear whether the vWF component of the FVIII molecule is of beneftt to hemophiliac patients with normal vWF, there is evidence that it contributes to the stability of the FVIII molecule. In conclusion, the classification of FVIU products on the basis of specific activity without considering the vWFAg content is not satisfactory.",

Objective: To evaluate whether the hepatitis A cases which recently occurred in 85 hemophilic patients from four European countries ( Italy,Germany, Irland and Belgium ) were acquired through trasfusion or the enteric route. Design : A case-control study based upon the Italian cohort. Setting: Twenty-eight hemophilia treatment centers in Italy. Patients: The first 29 consecutive hemophiliacs who developed hepatitis A jaundice were compared with one to three non-jaundiced hemophiliacs matched to cases by age, province of residence, type and severity of hemophilia and lifetime exposure to factor VIII concentrates. Measurements: Type of concentrate and batches infused, number of doses,, contacts with individuals who had jaundice or were diagnosed to have hepatitis A, travels abroad to countries reported to have a high attack rate for hepatitis A, consumption of raw shellfisch. Main results : Cases Were no more or less likely than controls to have travelled to high-risk countries, to have consumed raw shellfish or to have had contacts with jaundiced individuals. Cases were much more likely than controls to have used a factor VIII concentrate virus-inactivated with a solvent/detergent misture (odds ratio, 38;95 C1 1.8 to more than 1,000) and to have been infused with larger doses of the concentrate during the presumed incubation period of hepatitis A (odds ratio, 42; C1 6 to 196). Conclusions: In the Italian cohort, hepatitis A was transmitted by a factor VIII concentrate treated with a virusidal method (solvent/detergent) that is ineffective in inactivating nonenveloped viruses.",

            "text": "Acute Hepatitis in Haemophiliacs at the Bonn Haemophilia-Center Brackmann HH, Cerritzen A, Oldenburg J, Normann A, Flehming B, Gerlaeh WH, Hanfland P, Schneweis KE Since 1988 17 anti-hepatitis A (HAV) setoconcersions jave been obersved in a group of 46 haemophilia A patients suspectible for HAV infection. All of thel~ were trested with 1% the same factor VIII concentrate (Octavi), virus inactivated by the solvent/detergent method. Clinical disease and/or alanine aminotransferase peaks above 1O0 1U/1 were observed in 10 of 13 HAV-IgM-positive cases whereas 4 patients were detected only retrospectively. In contrast only 1 HAV seroconversion occured in a control group of 149 suspective patients, treated with other factor VIII concentrates. Moreover this one p~;t was the brother of a patient who had received Octavi ~\" and who had developed hepatitis A some weeks before. It has been argued by the manufacturer (Octapharma) that the diminished contents of the anti-HAV in their highly purifier Factor VIII concentrate could explain the observed cases as a result of lacking passive immunization. Indeed we could detect only r~mall amounts of anti-HAV in 2 of 18 batches of Octavi ~ with the sensitive IMx HAVAB EIA (Abbott). On the other hand a very simular result was obtained from high-purity-concentrates from other manufacturers: 0/12 batches of Hemophil M (Baxter}, 2/17 Koate HS (Cut-ter}, 2/16 Beriate H~ (Behring) were anti-HAV-positive, respectively. Therefore, the striking difference in the HAV incidence between the Octavi-and the control group can not be explained by the lack of antibodies to HAV in the Factor VIII preparation, but hints at a contamination with the virus itself. This suspicion is supported by the findings of Prof. Flehming's group who detected HAV RNA by an antigencapture/polymerasg~-chain-reaction assay in one batch (1367214) of Octavi r\" which had been administered to 4 of the 17 seroeonverted patients. The source of HAV in these preparations could be the ~ asma pools from unsuspected but infectious donors because AV causes strong viraemia during its incubation period. HAV is non-enveloped and heat-stable and probably not inactivated by the solvent/detergent inactivation procedure. As a consequence from our findings we started to vaccinate all anti-HAV-negative haemophilic patients. In accordance with the criteria of the \"Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International CommLttee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis\"(ICTH), 20 previously untreated children suffering from haemophilia A or B were prospectively examined for a possible virus infection after treatment with antihaemophilic factor concentrate. All patients were treated in case of bleeding with a tri(n-butyl) phosphate/Tween80 virus inactivated concentrate of the Alpha company. In tota! we used 67.500 Units from 10 batches out of the running production. No increase of ALT was observed and serological parameters for IIIV, hepatitis C and A remained negative. In this rigorous study not one of the 20 patients developed any positive marker for virus infection.",

            "text": "In an ICTH-controlled study we finished some months ago, it was found that all 20 patients were negative for hepatitis A-following treatment with a TNBP-inactivated product. In our group of 58 patients we found the following incidences of a positive hepatitis A serology. In group A -treated prior to any virus inactivation until 1985-we found 6 out of 25 patients (24 %) positive. In group Bexclusively treated with pasteurised products since 1978 -we found 2 out of 22 haemophiliacs (9 % ) positiv e and in group C -after treatment with TNBP-inactivated products for more than 5 years -one out of 11 patients (9 %) positive. The higher incidence in group A is most likely to be explained by the higher age of that group. The hepatitis A incidence in group B and C are identical, In conclusion, we found no increased risk of hepatitis A infection after receiving TNBP-treated products in our group of patients. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most frequent agent found in posttransfusion hepatitis. With the introduction of 2nd generation anti-HCV-test the evidence of sensitivi~ and specifity of the test was improved. Additionally, antibodies could be found in earlier and later stages of infection than using 1st generation tests. Patients: A group of children with coagulation disorders like haemophilia A, haemophilia B, yon Willebrand Disease (vWD), a-, hypo-, dys-fibrinogenaemia, factor X-and XI~-deficiency, treated with ptasma preparations were considered as beiing at high HCV risk. The anti-HCV prevalence in our pediatric patients was investigated retrospectively and mostly prospectively. We examined untreated patients with different coagulauon disorders, patients given non virus inactivated preparations, previously untreatect patients (pups) exclusively treated with different virus inactivated concentrates and controls. The resuits of the 1st and 2nd generation anti-HCV tests were compared, partly with identical serum samples. Tests were done 2-10 times/patient/year (median 3 ).Methods: 1st generation anti-HCV test ELISA (Ortho). 2 nd generation anti-HCV test ELISA (Abbott). Index levels > 2 were taken as positive, levels < 2 as non specific (nsp.) The results are shown in the following Following the implication of solvent/detergent (S/D) treated Factor VIII in the transmission of hepatitis A in haemophiliacs (Mannucci, Lancet 1992), relevant steps of the procedure were validated under various conditions using hepatits A virus. This has not been performed by other manufacturers of Factor VIII todate. A preliminary report is given on the neutralisation of this virus by pooled plasma used in factor VIII manufacture, the partition behaviour during cryoprecipitation, the influence of the SD treatment on immune complex formation and the effect of the ion exchange chromatography on virus removal. Furthermore, the stability of hepatitis A virus has been investigated under the strongly alkaline conditions of the ion exchange column recycling procedure in order to the hypothesis of virus accumulation and batch to batch carry-over. Extensive additional investigations including PCR testing of factor VIII products and case-controlled as well as epidemiological studies, which have been initiated by Octapharma, are reported elsewhere. It is becoming increasingly well recognized that limited proteolysis on cell surfaces is involved in a variety of biological processes such as inflammation and tumor invasion. Constitutive tissue factor (TF) as well as urokinase receptor (uPAR) expression was found in various breast cancer cell lines. The expression of TF on the cell surface activates the coagulation cascade, the expression of uPAR is essential for the activation of fibrinolysis. Whereas the biological role of \"IF as well as uPAR expression on tumor cells is not really clear, an increased content of urokinase-type plasminogen activator in tumor ceils seems to correlate with higher malignancy. When the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was incubated with TGF~ and EGF an increase in expression of both TF and uPAR could be detected by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry using moneclonal antibodies. In addition, we observed an increased mRNA level of TF as well as nPAR in MCF-7 after stimulation. The kinetics of TF and uPAR expression on cell surfaces are different with a maximum for TF after 6 hours followed by a maximum for urokinase receptor after 24-48 hours. There seems to be a time dependence of TF and uPAR expression with regard to the abillity of tumor cells to regulate cell associated fibrin formation and fibrinolysis. Recombinant IL-2 (rlL-2) or recombinant TNFct plus recombinant IFNy (rTNFedrlFN-/) given intravenously tor solid tumors can dose dependently result in a sepsis like entity, including acute phase reaction, vascular leak syndrome, and alterations in vascular resistance. We analyzed the activation of the coagulation and the complement system. -Treatment schedules: rlL-2 was given in 3 cycles, consisted of each 5 days, with increasing dosage (6 to 12 x 106 I E per square meter body surface [sqm BS]). rTNFWrlFNywas given in 2 cycles with increasing dose (125 i.tg rTNFe per sqm BS plus 6.3 p.g rlFNg per sqm BS to 250 i.tg rTNFa per sqm BS plus 12.5 I.tg rIFNy per sqm BS. -Methods : The coagulation system were assessed by antithrombin III (AT III), thrombin-AT Ill-complexes (TAT), fibrinogen (Clauss and western blotting) and platelet count; the complement system by CH 50, C4, and the activation products CSa, and TCC; the acute phase reaction by C-reactive protein (CRP). -Results: Maximum CRP was seen at the end of each treatment cycle (11.4-17.3 mg/dl; median: 13.2 mg/dl). Maximum complement activation was found at day +4 (rlL-2 therapy) and at day +5 (rTNFc~ LrlFNT~3ycle). with up to three times elevated C5a and/or TCC values. ATlll showed decreasing values from 100% -140% (of control plasma) prior to therapy to a minimum of 560. ATIII was inversely correlated to TCC (p<0.01 ; Ftest). TAT levels were significantly increased during bolh immunotherapies. Differences between IL-2 and rTNFWrlFN7 therapy were seen lor libdnogen (Clauss) and platelet counts: In rTNF~drlFN 7 therapy, fibdnogen values decreased to hall ol the starting range, and platelet counts fall from 180-230 K/id to 20-32 K/id with a calculated haft time of 18-22 hours. Platelet counts were inversely correlated to CRP (p<0.01 ; F-test). In IL-2 therapy, fibdnogen was increasing, and platelet decrease was significantly less (from 118-130 K lid to 80-89 K/id). Decrease ol platelet counts was correlated to the complement activation parameters C5a and TCC (p<0.02; F-test). -Conclusions: The dL-2 and rTNFedrlFNy therapy schedule induce simultaneous activation of complement and coagulation, resulting in findings similar to disseminated intravascular coagulation. The platelet consumption is more severe during rTNFcdrlFNy. The alterations of both complement and coagulation were normalized within 3-7 days after end of each therapy cycle. In recent years automated instruments have gained a widespread use in coagulation laboratories. In order to meet the increased demands on convenience, short assay times as well as simple application to automates, COATEST FVIII has been revised. Use of the sensitive chromogenic FXasubstrate S-2765 as well as a three-fold higher plasma concentration has resulted in a short assay time with 2 min each for activation of FX and hydrolysis of S-2765. Furthermore, purified bovine FIXa is colyophilized with phospholipid and calcium ions in order to simplify reagent handling. Apart from the range 0.05-1.4 IU/mL whieh covers most applications, a special low range, 0.01-0.05 IU/mL has been introduced for analysis of very low levels of FVIII. In the low range the activation and hydrolysis times are 4 and 10 min respectively. The resolution is high as illustrated by AA405 x min d x IU -1 = 0.25. Heparin levels < 1.5 UhnL will not interfere in the assay. In both ranges a good agreement is obtained with standard curves prepared in the presence and absence of FVIII deficiency plasma warranting a high specificity of the method. The high accuracy of the COATEST FVIII kit is maintained with COAMATE FVIII as illustrated from comparative studies providing r -values > 0.9.",

Application of chromogenic substratcs are also possible in both systems. We compared both analyzers by linear regression analysis in patients with normal and pathologic values of aPTT, PT (n=50), fibrinogen (derived) and plasminogen (n=20, chromogenic assay). Derived fibrinogen was compared with the method of Clauss on Sehnitger coagulometer. Moreover we focused our interest on the sensitivity of both systems (nephelomctric, lurbidimetric) in the highly pathologic range of clotting parameters by geometric dilution of all factors of the extrinsic and intrinsic system with factor deficient plasma from 100% to 0.5% of clotting activity and by measuring the aPTT of stable heparinized patients with aPTT between 36 and 100 sec, and PT measurements of different normal and pathologic control plasmas (n=10, each series). Assay conditions were the same in both ACL and Electra, respectively. Methods were adapted according to recommendations of the manufactarers. Statistical analysis has been done by using paired student's t-test. PT and aPTT showed good correlation coefficients (r=0.99 and r=0.98, rasp.), whereas those of fibrinogen and plasminogen were slightly lower (r=0.93 and r=-0.92, resp.). Within run precision of all tests were comparable in both analyzers yielding variation coefficients between 1 and 5% (independent of the pathologic range). Derived fibrinogen measured by the optical systems showed no significant difference to the mechanically determined fibrinogen with the Clanss method. Accuracy of determination deteriorated significantly in the highly pathologic range, and sometimes Electra 1000 displayed no dot detection, although the value was within the range of the standard curve. ACL showed clearly longer aPTT values in heparinized patients than Electra. In conclusion, both systems are applicable for routine determination methods. In contrast to ACL 300, Electra 1000 C falls in continuous clot detection in the high pathologic range which is of disadvantage in special coagulation disorders. Plasminogen activator inhibitor {PAl-11 is a glu with a molecular weight of 50.000 Dalton. It is a member of the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) with homologies to other serine protease inhibitors. PAl-1 is an acute phase protein and the concentration is correlated to Interleukin I level. Elevated PAl-1 levels will be observed in patients with thrombotic disorders (deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke), some malignancies and septicaemia. The PAI-1antigen-ELISA can be used to measure the antigen levels in plasma. We compared the PAl-l-antigen-ELlSA-test from TechnoCIone/Vienna and the IMMUNOZYM PAl-1 from IMMUNO/Heidelberg which use the same monoclonal antibodies anti-PAl-t immobilised onto plastic microtiter strips, anti-PAl-I conjugates to peroxidase and the same PAl-1 antigen as calibrator.",

Extra-corporeal drcalation (ECC) in cardiosur#cal intervention requires high dose heparinisation for the inhibition of the dotting cascade that is activated both through damage to the vessel (extrinsic) land through the blood coming into contact with various artificial surfaces (intrinsic pathway). The activation of the fibrinolytic system thus inevitably caused is in most heart eentres nowadays reduced through the application of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin (Trasylol, Bayer/Germany). The necessary monitoring of anticoagulation during ECC is carried out with the activated whole blood clotting time (ACT). The two machines used for this at present, Hemotec (Englewood, Colorado/USA) and Hemochron (Edison, N.J./USA), function with the different contact phase activators kaolin (clay = hydrated aluminium silicate) and eelite (ldeselgur = diatom earth). These two activators display highly significant differences (t-test, p<0.01) during ECC both in the pure in vitro tests (modified ~ with whole blood in a neutral eoab, ulometer, n= 14) as well as in parallel measurement with patient blood (n=20) with the two original machines. The Hemotec machine with kaolin as activator showed no effect due to aprotinin application during the whole duration of surgery while with the Hemochron machine almost double the dottin$ time was re$istered as soon as the combination of aprotimn -heparin crusted. Measurement errors arising from the technical limitations of the machines themselves explain the effects of aprotinin as often described in the literature regards a prolongation of the ACT, the sul3sequent anticoagulant properties and thus possible heparin reduction during ECC; these errors should be corrected as quickly as possible.",

Until recently, PS deficiency had to be diagnosed by the determination of PS antigen concentration. For a few months PS activity (PS Act) assays have become commercially available. However, few experiences on the routine application of those new assays have been published. Therefore, the results of the first PS Act determinations performed in our laboratory with assay kits from three manufacturers are presented in comparison with the dam evaluated by our standard PS antigen (PS Ag) assay. Citrate blood plasma samples obtained from 100 individuals with thrombotic or thrombuembolic events were analysed for the PS levels. PS ACt determinations were done using Protein S Activity Assay [A] (Behring), Protein S Clotting-Test [B] (Boeininger Mannhaim/Diagnostica Stage) and IL Test TM Protein S [(2] (Immnnentation Laboratory). The concentrations of total PS and of free PS Ag were determined by Protein S-ELISA (Boehringer Mannheim]Diagnosfica Stage), respectively. The results of the activity and antigen assays were compared by linear regression analysis. The regression data (y (PS Ac 0 = a + bX (PS Ag)) with X = total PS Ag yielded for A: a=29.6, b---0.500, correlation coefficient 1\"=0.448 (N=74), for B: a=19.4, b=0.653, I\"=-0.561 (N=79), and for C: a=19.7, b=0.767, 1\"=-0.725 (N=71).

PS ACt and PS Ag levels above the upper cot-off level of 125% were excluded from the analysis. The data of PS Act obtained by assays B and C correlated fairly well with total and free PS Ag (r> 0.55). The best correspondence was observed gor assay B compared with free PS Ag, as indicated by the slope b=0.928 of the regression curve. Th~ was confirmed by the finding that among the 10 samples exhibiting total PS Ag below the normal range (70-120 %) together with free PS Ag or PS Act below 40 % of normal 5 samples yielded nearly equal PS Act and free PS Ag values (_+ 10 %). Nevertheless, due to the small amber of samples analysed it is too early to conclude, that assay B might be the most sensitive assay for the determination of free PS activity. Further investigations have to be done also in order to characterize the sensitivities of assays A and B with respect to total and free PS Ag.",

            "text": "Mrs H. Hoffmann is gratefully acknowledged for expert technical assistenue. A new F XlII assay (Berichrom F XIII, Behring Werke AG, Germany) permits the measurement of F XIII in untreated and undiluted plasma. Acquired partial deficiency of F XIII has been reported in association with severe liver disease and DIC. Therefore, F XIII deficiency may play a role in the increased bleeding tendency during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) as in parallel to end-stage liver disease a DIC-like state is observed intraoperatively. Materials and methods: Arterial blood samples were collected at 7 different timepoints during 10 OLTs. In addition a sample of the perfusate released from the graft was taken when the graft was floaded with the recipiant's systemic blood. F XIII activity was determined using the established clot solubility test (Behring) as well as the photometric F XIII assay. Results: The performance of the photometric test took only a tenth of time as compared to the clot solubility test. It demonstrated a very good withinrun and day to day precision. A highly significant correlation between the two assays (p <0.01) was observable. Preoperative F XIII activity were in the lower part of the normal range. With beginning of the anhepatic phase a significant decrease of F XIIl activity was seen (p=0.04) followed by a short but insignificant increase in the early reperfusion phase and by a significant decrease 10 minutes later (p=0.02). In 7 patients F XIII activity levels in the perfusate were far higher than in the systemic circulation (p=0.07). Conclusion: The fast photometric F XIII assay showed a high precision and a good correlation to the clot solubility test. The decrease of F Xlll activity in the anhepatic phase is probably due to increased fibrinolysis. Higher F XIII activity levels in the graft liver perfusate and the increase of F XIII activity with starting reperfusion suggest a hepatic release of F XIII. investigations may be hampered without the knowledge of the clotting and fibrinolytic system of the laboratory animal used. With diagnostics for the determination of clotting factors and fibrinotytic parameters in hunmn plasma, samples from rat, guinea pig, rabbit, cat, dog, sheep, cattle, horse, pig~and monkey were analysed, The human system was employed even for standard curves and controls. Results obtained in this way are relative values in relation to pooled fresh human plasma of healthy donors uhich is defined to have 100 X of the norm or 1 unit of each factor per 1 mr. Under these conditions marked differences between the human clotting system and those of different animal species appear. Thus~ rabbits have an about 50 times higher activity of factor V than humans, and guinea pigs only 6 X of the factor VII activity of human plasma. Plasma levels of fibrinogen and~'2-antiptasmin in plasma samples of the investigated animal species are in the range of human plasma. Differences in the plasma levels of single factors as compared to human plasma are reflected by the clotting times of the screening tests. For the determination of ptasminogen, streptokinase was used as activator of the fibrinotytic system. Hence, the results obtained by this method merely represent the activatabitity of the animal plasminogen in comparison to the human system, and thus do not allow statements concerning the real plasminogen content of the plasma sample from the animal species. The implications of the results for pharmacological investigations are dicussed. The analyzers characteristics can be described as follows: 1. All traditional clotting tests including the determination of single factors, Antithrombin III, Protein C and Protein S can be performed with random as well as continous access (including stat function) using primary sample cups. 2. Clot formation is detected optu-mechanically: the developing clot in the measuring cuvette is centered by magnetic stirring and the onset of coagulation is determined by detecting the fibrin thread formation in the light path of the optical unit. Therefore samples known to disturb photooptical coagulation measurement, i.e. turbidic samples, can be measured without any problems. For evaluation this new system was compared with other analyzers used for coagulation testing (ACL, Instrumentation LaboratoD,, Milan, Italy; Electra 1000 C, MLA, Pleasantville, NY, USA; KC l0 and KC 40, Amelnng, Lemgo, Germany). While reagents from Behringwerke were used for operating the Fibrintimer A, KC 10 and KC 40, the Electra 1000 C and the ACL were run with the respective ~agents from Baxter Diagnostics. (Miami. FL. USA~ and Instrumentation Laboratory as well as the Behringwerke reagents in parallel, when appropriate. The results show a good reproducibility of measurements. Intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%) for control and patient plasma samples were between 1.6 and 4.4 for PT (%) using Thromborel S, 0.7 and 3.4 respective 0.6 ~nd 5.2 for aPTT (sec) using Pathromtin and Neothromtin, 1.1 and 8.8 for fibrinogen determination (g/I) using Mnltifibren (all reagents from Behringwerke). The method comparison shows good agreement between the methods evaluated, i.e. there are good correlations of results between the Fihrintimer A and the KC 10 / KC 40 for PT (r = 0.971), aPTT (r = 0.875 and 0.954 using Pathromtin and Neothromtin, respectively) and fibrinogen (r = 0.964) as well as between the Fibrintimer A, the Electra 1000 C and the ACL (r-values about in the same order). These results show, that the Fibrintimer A is well suited for routine coagulation testing. ",

In all subjects ascending venography was performed within 24 hours before starting the urokinase therapy. The promotion of the resolution of venographically confirmed DVT was then evaluated by repeat duplex sonography within 24 hours using a 7,5 MHz sector duplex probe with an integrated pulsed 3 MHz frequency Doppler system connected to a Konton Sigma 44 equipment. Juding the duplexsonographic findings this noninvasive method helped to define the termination or continuation of the thrombolytic therapy in 18 of 20 subjects. In 2 patients duplex sonography failed to estimate the present status. Early total recanalization of ileofemlral veins within 4 and 5 days of thrombolytic therapy was detected in 3 patients suggesting the interruption of the urokinase therapy. The data of this investigation indicate that duplex sonography is a useful tool in assessment of the efficacy of thrombolysis in DVT reducing ascending contrast venography examinations during thrombolytic therapy. This method is non invasive, it can be carried out repeatedly every day with no risks and helps to improve the duration of thrombolytic therapy in DVT. Despite these advantages of duplexsonographic examinations ascending contrast venography examinations are still necessary to evaluate indications of thrombolytic therapy and to estimate prognoses in patients after thrombolysis of DVT.",

Albert since blood contains PAI-I, the fast acting inhibitor of t-PA and plasmin inhibitors, such as alpha-2-antiplasmin, the immediately inactivation of these inhibitors after blood drawing is especially important in the estimation of t-PAactivity. The standard procedure, as suggested by many authors, consisting in immediate acidification and centrifugation of the blood samples is not easy to handle. We studied in 29 healthy volunteers a more practicable technique in sample collection and processing. Blood samples, taken at the same time, were prepared by both, the standard procedure and the modification. In modification, blood was drawn in plastic tubes, prefilled with sodium citrate for 0.05 mol/l and acetate buffer pH 3.9 for O.i mol/l as final concentrations. Samples were centrifuged at once and after a 1 or 2 hours incubation on ice. The samples then were stored at -70~ and assayed after at least 4 weeks at once. The results we obtained showed no significant difference between the standard method and our more practible modification, also after a storage over 1 or 2 hours on ice. It is known that F.VIII:C activity decreases if plasma samples are stored for several hours at room temperature (RT). However, storage time and temperature between blood collection and analysis sometimes vary considerably and cannot be defined. As the influence of storage en~litions on different assay systems may vary, we decided to carry out the forlowi~g study: plasma (a) of healthy volunteers (n = 12) and (b) of hemoi~hiliaes receiving F.VIII-substitution therapy (n = 10; range of F.VIII activity: 33 to 121.5%) was stored at -20~ 4~ and RT for 6 hours. The F.VIII:C determinations were carried out with a one stage clotting assay and a chromogenic substrate method (IMMUNOCHROM F.VIII:C). In several cases, the clotting method gave higher values than the chromogenic assay: (1.) in healthy volunteers versus substituted hemophiliacs; (2.) in plasmas stored at -20 ~ versus plasma at 4 ~ or RT; (3.) in plasmas with F.VIII activity > 120%. However, the correlation of both determinations was acceptable (r = 0.866, n = 173). When F.VIII concentrate was added to lyophilized plasma (to about 200%), both occurs in some plasmas during blood sampling, which only influences the clotting assay. Interestingly, the loss in F.VIII:C activity during storage is higher (1.) in healthy persons than in substituted hemophiliacs; (2.) in the ehromogenic than in the clotting method; (3.) in samples stored at 4 ~ than in samples stored at -20~ or at RT. Our study showed that loss in F.VIII:C activity is least at -20 ~ in both assay systems. It even appeared, that a slight activation of the coagulation system during storage of plasma at -20 ~ occurs, since in the clotting assay the mean F.VIII activity in the plasma of substituted hemophiliacs. stored at -20~ is even higher than the initial value. In sununary, if an average decrease of F.VIII activity of 11% can be accepted, plasma samples can be stored at room temperature for 3 hours. We developed a new clot lysis assay performed on microtitre plates to evaluate the individual fibrinolytic activity induced by various plasminogen activators in plasma. By adding plasma to Thrombin and either Streptokinase (SK), Urokinase (u-PA) or t-PA in Tris-suffer, clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis can be visualized and quantified by measuring the optical density at 495 nm. plasma from i00 persons without a history of thromboembolic diseases as well as plasma from 200 patients with a history of thromboembolic diseases where assayed in the described way. The results were compared with immunologic and functional measurement of Fibrinogen, PAI, t-PA, Antiplasmin and global clotting assays as well as with the results from the venous occlusion test. In 80% of all plasma samples a quick fibrinolytic response to all three fibrinolytic agents could be observed.",

            "text": "In plasma from patients with a history of thromboembolic diseases the fibrinolytic response was impaired in 6% with SK, in 4% with u-PA and in 6% with t-PA and u-PA. In plasma from patients without a history of thrombosis fibrinolytic response was impaired in 12% with SK, in 2% with u-PA and 6% with t-PA. Prospective clinical studies are required to determine whether these findings lead to consequences in choice and dosage of specific Plasminogen activators especially in patients with an impaired fibrinolytic system. Euglobulin lysis time (ELT) is a global test for the study of fibrinolysis, useful to measure both baseline and stimulated fibrin dissolution in a milieu largely depleted of natural inhibitors of fibriuolysis, To obtain reliable re~uhs preparation of samples as well as blood sampling and procedures of performing ELT must be well standardized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of storage of plasma and euglobulin precipitates (El>) on ELT by testing samples obtained both before and after 10 min of venous occlusion (VO). From 20 healthy subjects (21-40 yrs) EP were obtained from diluted and acidified platelet-poor plasma (PPP) by centrifugation at 1500g, for 10 min at 4~ and careful removal of surnatant. After resuspension in Owren's buffer, EP were coagulated by thrombin. ELT was measured on : a -EP prepared within 90 min from blood withdrawal (reference ELT),b -EP obtained from PPP stored for 24 hrs at -80~ c -EP obtained from PPP stored for 24 hrs at -20~ d -EP frozen for 24 hrs at -80\"C; e -EP frozen for 24 hrs at -20 ~ C;f -EP dissolved in Owren's buffer and frozen for 24 hrs at -80~ g -EP dissolved in Owren's buffer and frozen for 24 hrs at -20 ~ C, ELT measured on EP dissolved in Owren's buffer and stored both at -20 ~ C and -80 ~ C and ELT measured on PPP stored at -20 ~ C were significantly longer than reference ELT (at least p<0.05). On the contrary, no differences were observed in ELT measured on PPP 9 stored at -80 ~ C and on EP undissolved and stored both at -20 ~ C and -80 ~ C. The pattern was similar in samples obtained both before and after VO. These data indicate that the freezing and storage of samples of PPP at -80~ or undissolved EP at -80~ and at -20~ allows to correctly evaluate both low and high fibrinolytic activity, making it possible the simultaneous determination of a laxge number of samples collected at different times of the previous day. but also in addition platelet aggregation both in the blood and on the surface has added to the problem of analysis. Our method is simple (i ml blood), rapid and can be performed in every routine laboratory but further clinical evaluation is necessary. Diagnosis of congenital or acquired coagulation disorders is made by proven clotting methods including overall clotting methods and various specific tests such as chromogenic substrate assays. The development of new drugs controlling haemostasis requires pharmacological studies in animals. The aim of this study was to transfer established procedures to veterinary medicine. In species such as rat, rabbit, cat, dog, sheep and pig, coagulation profiles were done by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT) and chromogenic substrate assays for the determination of plasminogen, the so-called antiplasmin activity and heparin (via an anti Xa test) by commercially available reagents. The aPTT, PT and TT revealed results indicating dependance on the used reagents. Coagulation assays in animals can be performed with minor modifications related to species and thus revea~ reproducible results. Prothrombin time should be performed by reagents according to the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and results expressed in the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Chromogenic substrate assays can be adapted to animals. Standard curves provided with unfractionated and Imw heparin revealed results depending on brand and species. Shortly summarized, test methods established in human medicine can generally be transferred to the demands of veterinary medicine -however, modifications and/or proper selection of the commercially available reagents are necessary depending on the species and/or test We describe here a chromogenic substrate assay to measure functional levels of Protein-S in human plasma. This assay is based on the use of highly purified coagulation proteins and incorporates human recombinant factor VIII (FVIII). In the first phase of the assay a known amount of FVIII is inactivated by activated protein C (APC) in the presence of a Protein-S (PS) containing plasma sample, phospholipids and calcium ions. The residual FVIII activity (FVIIIres) which is measured in the second phase of the assay is a measure of the Protein-S functional activity in the plasma sample. The chemistry of the Protein-S assay is illustrated in the following equations : Some studies have shown that some fibrinolytic and haemostatic variables, such as PAl, Lp(a), fibrinogen, are elevated in patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it was suggested that alterations of the fibrinolytic and/or haemostatic balance could play a major role in the pathogenesis of ischemic events. It also known that deficiencies of protein C or protein S as well as raised levels of anticardiolipin antibodies are associated with ischemic events. Therefore, we thought it would be important to analyze a series of haemostatic variables in 72 patients (36 males and 36 females, mean age 66+10) with previous ischemic stroke. Fifty % of the patients (16 M, 20 F) were hypertensive; 25% (9 M, 9 F) had diabetes mellitus; 39% (26 M, 2 F) were smokers and 6% exsmokers; 15% (9 M, 2 F) were ethanol drinkers; 51% (19 M, 18 F) had a history of previous ischemic episodes and 39% (13 M, 15 F) had a positive family history for cardiovascular disease. Mean value of fibrinogen (mg/dl), determined by Clauss method, was 374,3+ 88,7 (10 pz > 450 = 14%); tPA-antigen (ng/ml) was 10,8+4,4 (36 pz> 10 = 50%); PAl 1-antigen (ng/ml) was 41,2+26,8 (24 pz > 43= 33%); Lp(a) (mg/L) was 237,2+328,5 (12 pz > 300 = 17%). The only correlation observed was between tPA and PAl-1 (p<0,0001). Our study population was homogeneous for all the variables, most often associated with the occurence of ischemic events, and there was no significant difference between each class of patients. Furthermore, there was no difference between male and female population, with respect to the variables analyzed, consistent with the concept that hemostatic variables in thrombosis are similar in males and in postmenopausal females.",

Binder* PGEl-infusion therapy has been shown to improve hemodynamic parameters in pts. with severe ventricular dysfunction. As a side effect bleeding complications have been described. It is further known that an increase or decrease of cardiac output (CO) might reactively influence the fibrinolytic system by alteration of liver metabolism of its main components, t-PA and PAl-1. To prove possible influences of PGEl-infusion on the fibrinolytic potential we investigated 11 males with dilated CMP and severe ventricular dysfunction treated with maximal tolerable PGEl-infusions (group A) for their possible alterations of systemic blood pressure, heart rate, pulmonary arterial pressure, CO, cardiac index (CI), as well as t-PA and PAl-1 plasma levels, and compared the data to those obtained from 4 otherwise comparable and similarily treated pts. without PGEl-therapy (group B). As compared to conservatively treated pts. in PGEl-treated pts. a significant improvement of CO (A: from 5.1 to 6.2; B: from 4.9 to 4.9) and of CI (A: from 2.6 to 3.2; B: from 2.4 to 2.4) could be demonstrated. However, t-PA antigen, PAl-1 antigen, as well as PAl-1 activity did not show any significant alterations of their preand posttreatment plasma levels in both study groups. From these data it is concluded, that infusions with high dosages of PGE1 do not influence the fibrinolytic potential despite significant alterations of hemodynamic parameters. Furthermore, data obtained from human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures (HUVEC) investigating possible PGEl-mediated alterations of tPA and PAl-1 expression have shown no effects. Therefore, bleeding complications during PGEl-infusions seem to be mainly due to the known platelet inhibitory action of PGE1 and can not he attributed to a profibrinolytic effect of this substance. M. Pfohl, A, df Nicuolo, T. Risler, M. Eg~stein, H. Muller, and E. Seifried The influe,qce of two extcacorporeal ehmination procedures for low-density lipoproteins on the coagulation and fibrlnoiyti<' system was compared among five patients treated with the immunoadsorptJon technique (IMA) and iou;c patients receiving a dextran sulfate adsorption (DSA) therapy. Using a combined ~ anticoagulation with heparin and citrate for IMA and exclusively heparin for DSA, a significantly greater effect of DSA on global coagulation tests was found despite of comparable dosages of heparin. This was due to a considerable reduction of the coagulation factors V, VIII-C, XI, XII, and preKalllkrein by 63-99% at the end of DSA whereas only factor VIII-C showed a marked decline by 72% after IMA. Coagulation Jnhibitors as well as plasminogen and antJplasmin were only marginally influenced by both apheresis techniques. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-I) activity were both reduced by DSA while IMA constantly lowered only PAI-I activity. All aonormaities of global coagulatlon tests and of most clotting factors were restored one day after treatment in both procedures followed by a moderate rebound phenomenon in single coagulation factors during the next days. In conclusion, the DSA technique exerts a more profound effect on haemostasis than the IMA method by a substantial co-elimination of various coagulation factors in addition to the desired removal of atherogenic iipopro~eins.",

Several prospective studies have shown that plasma fibrinogen (Fbg) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular ischemic events. Bezafibrate (Bzf), a lipid-lowering drug, is able to decrease Fbg levels in diabetic hyperfibrinogenemic patients. This study was aimed to evaluate if the modifications of Fbg levels induced by Bzf administration in healthy subjects are related to changes of clotting and fibrinolytic parameters. Ten healthy non-smoker volunteers (5 women not on pill and 5 men, 36-45 years) with plasma lipids and hemostatic parameters within the normal range for the age were investigated. The study was performed according to a randomized cross-over design by two sequential 30 day-treatment periods respectively on Bzf (400 mg of Bzf \"retard\" daily: \"Bezalip Retard\", Boehringer Mannheim Italia -BMI-Milan, Italy) and on placebo, preceded and separated by a 21 day-wash-out period. Blood samples were obtained on the first and the 30th day of each period. The following parameters were determined: Fbg by automatic apparatus (ACL, Instrumentation Laboratory -IL-, Milan, Italy), fibrinopeptide A (ELISA, BMI, Milan, Italy), cholesterol (Chol), triglycerides (TG) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-Chol) by refiectometric method (Reflotron System, BMI, Milan, Italy), plasminogen and alpha2-antiplasmin by functional methods (ACL, IL, Milan, Italy). Fibrinolytic activity was assessed before and after 10 min of venous occlusion by determination of: ELT, t-PA and PAl-1 activity (amidolytic assays, Kabi Vitrum, Molndal, Sweden), t-PA and PAI-1 antigen (ELISA, Biopool, Umea, Sweden) . No changes of different parameters were observed during placebo administration. A sigrfificant decrease both in Fbg (-15.7% + 11.58, p<0.05) and in Chol (-15.0% + 6.90, p<0.005) was observed after 30-day Bzf treatment. On the contrary, no significant changes in the other clotting and fibrinolytic parameters or in TG and HDL-Chol were found. These data suggest a direct influence of Bzf on hepatic synthesis of Fbg, without modifications of other proteins of the hemostatic system.",

            "text": "Center of Heart and Thrombosis Research, Clinica Medica I, University of Florence, Italy The relatively high incidence of thromboembolic complications in the neonatal period requires investigation of the fibrinolytic capacity and the individual dosis of thrombolytic agents. In this study, fibrinolysis of newborns was evaluated by using new methods. Venous blood samples were obtained from 32 healthy newborn infants within the first week of life. A chromogenic substrat assay was used to determine plasminogen activity and a global screening test (Fibri Screen Assay,Baxter) to evaluate whole plasma fibrinolytic potential. Clot lysis time was measured kinetically by using a micro clot lysis assay (Lewis et al., Thromb Res 64,223,1991) . The results were compared with those in adult plasma. Plasminogen activity (60.7%\u2022 and fibrinolytic potential (62%\u2022 were found to be significantly lower in newborns. The newborn plasma required 6 times higher concentrations of urokinase to start lysis and complete lysis time was two times longer. There was only a poor correlation between plasminogen activityand fibrinolytic potential or clot lysis time. Data from the present study emphasized again that fibrinolytic response of newborns is significantly reduced. Additionally impaired clot lysis was not only due to low plasminogen activity. The variability of values from patient to patient suggests that urokinase requirement must be considered for each patient individually. The micro clot lysis assay could be a simple method for this purpose and also for monitoring thrombolytic therapy. Fifty-nine patients with coronary heart disease allocated fur PTCA showed significantly elevated thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (TAT; ~ = 2.3 vs. 1.4 ng/ml) compared to 19 control patients who showed normal coronary vessels by angiography. There was also an impaired fibrinolytic capacity determined by venous occlusion compared to patients without coronary arteriosclerotic lesions. In a prospective part of the study blood analyses were done before PTCA, 24 h, 48 h and 3 months aRer PTCA. All patients underwent a control angiography after 3 months and restenosis was documented in 24 patients. Both patient groups with and without restenosis showed an activation of coagulation after PTCA by increased TAT. The increase of D-Dimer was prolonged in patients without restenosis compared to patients with restenosis. The ratio D-Dimer/TAT significantly decreased 24 h and 48 h after PTCA indicating prolonged disturbed balance between coagulation activation and fibrinolysis in the group with restenosis. Fibrinolytic capacity (venous occlusion)was markedly lower only in the restenosis group before PTCA compared to controls (x = 5.7 vs. 13:3 IU/ml). The present findings suggest that low fibrinolytic capacity may be a risk factor for developing restenosis after primarily successful PTCA. In previous investigations, a variety of polyanionic compounds have been tested for their tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) releasing effect in vitro and in vivo. Of these substances, unfractionated heparin (UFH), pentosan polysulphate (SP54), the polysulphated bis-lactobionic acid amide derivative LW 10121, enoxaparin-sodium, defibrotide, sodium humate (Na-HS), ammonium humate (I~ffI4-HS), and the polymeric oxidation product of caffeic acid (KOP) proved to be effective (K10cking H-P, Hamostaseologie 11:76, 1991) . Attempts were made to rule out an effect of these compounds on the acute activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAl-l), an important component of the antithrombotic defense mechanism. In vitro studies indicated that the incubation of polyanionic compounds with PAI-I had no effect on its ability to form t-PA o PAL1 complexes, and that the incubation of these substances with preformed ,t-PA o PAl-1 complexes does not modify their stability. Furthermore, the influence of polyanionic compounds was studied in rats after intravenous bolus injection of 10 mg/kg each. Within 5 to 10 min after administration of the following substances, a decrease in acute PAl-1 activity was found: UFH: 53 -+ 18 %; SP54: 89 -+ 9 %; LW 10121:38 +_ 20 %; enoxaparin-sodium: 75 -+ 2 %; defibrotide: 60 \u2022 16 %; Na-HS: 58 \u2022 17 %; NH4-HS: 32 _.+ 23 %; KOP: 31 \u2022 23 %, resp. The decrease in acute PAl-1 activity is explained by complexing with simultaneously released t-PA. ",

            "text": "We have evaluated the sensitivity to tPA-induced lysis of clots prepared from plasma preincubated in vitro with therapeutic concentrations of unfractionated heparin (UH) or 3 different low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Labelled fibrin clots, prepared from plasma containing UH, fraxiparine, reviparine, encxaparine or saline, were incubated for 2 hours at37 ~ in PBS containing t-PA (0.1 and 0.5 ,u~/ml) and plasminogen (20 /Jg/ml). The extent of clot lysis was quantified by counting the residual radioactivity of the clots and by measuring D-Dimer levels into the medium. Fibrin polymerization and clot structure were evaluated by means of a turbidimetric assay and by electron microscopic scanning. Clots prepared from plasma.containing 0.5 and 1.0 U/ml of UH showed lysis rates higher (up to 236%) than control clots. Preincubation of plasma with 1.0 IU/ml Fraxiparine, Reviparine and Enoxaparine increased lysis rates induced by 0.1 pg/ml t-PA by 49%,43% and 42%, respectively, over the lysis rate of control clots. Lysis rates induced by 0.5/Jg/ml t-PA were not significantly modified by LMWHs. The effect of UH was not mediated by the inhibition of thrombin as preincubation of plasma with hirudin did not modify clot lysis. We also found that UH modifies fibrin assembly and clot structure leading to the formation of thicker fibrin fibres and clots with large pores. In contrast with UH, LMWHs induced only minor modifications of fibrin polymerization and clot structure. An increase of clot sensitivity to lysis can contribute to the antithrombotic activity as well as to the bleeding complications of heparins. Our data suggest that the early administration of UH along with thrombolytic agents could increase the speed of reperfusion and reduce the risk of rethrombosis. In addition, our results contribute to explain the minor hemorrhagic potential of LMWHs in comparison with UH. An association between plasminogen activators and tumor invasion has been described in various malignancies and recent findings suggest that high u-PA levels in breast cancer tissue predict elevated recurrence rates. Patients and methods : To study the tumor-associated role of plasminogen activators and their inhibitors in gynecologic neoplasms, u-PA, t-PA and PAI Ag levels were determined by ELISA in 224 tissue samples obtained during gynecologic surgery: 189 from patients with malignant disease (152 breast-, 25 ovarian-, 12 vulvar-cancer) and 35 benign tissue samples collected from patients who underwent surgery for benign fibroadenomas or mammary dysplasia.The median age of these woman was 60 years (range 29 to 93 years). Parallel we detemimed the receptors for estrogen (E2R), progesterone (PrgR) and Epidermal-Growth-Factor (EGFR). Correlation was sought between the type, size and differentiation of the tumor, lymph node involvement, invasion of lymphatics, menopausal status and age. Results and Conclusion:u-PA and PAI-levels in breast-, ovarian-and vulvar-cancer tissue were higher than in benign tissue samples, but only the differences in breast tissue samples were statistically significant (.p<0.005). u-PA and PAI did not depend on other established prognosuc variables such as lymph node involvement, tumor size, age or menopausal status. In cases of hemangiosis or lymphangiosis carcinomatosa, PAI levels were particularly elevated. High PAI-levels and EGFR correlate with low levels of E2R and PrgR. No statistically significant differences were noted for t-PA between malignant and benign tissue samples, but high grade dedifferentiated neoplasms revealed significantly lower t-PA levels (p< 0.005). The considerable variations in u-PA and PAl Ag levels can be of major importance in predicting the course of disease and may help in the decision whether adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated or not, particularly in patients without lymph node involvement. However, further follow-up will be needed to prove the therapeutical and prognostic relevance of the tumor associated elevated levels of u-PA and PAI in gynecologic neoplasms.",

Monocytes were obtained from 13 patients with larynx (7) and oral cavity (6) carcinoma and from 13 sex and age matched healthy subjects free from infectious and from any drug in the 2 weeks preceeding blood sampling. Pure monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuctear cells by plastic adherence and incubated in the presence of 10 p.g/ml LPS for 4 h at 37~C. IL-113 IL-6 and TNF-c~ concentration was assyed in the supernatants by specific immunoassay (ELISA). Upon LPS stimulation IL-6 and TNF formation by monocytes from HNSC patients was significantly higher than that from controls; conversely, no significant differences in IL-13 levels were observed. A significant correlation between IL-6 and IL-113 and between TNF-a and IL-6 was evidenced by the Spearman rank correlation test in monocytes release. in conclusion, our results suggest that the increased levels of circulating cytokines may be responsible at least in pad for the increasing IL-6 production.",

In order to prevent complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation, samples were drawn at intervals of 1.5 hours beginning with the intravenous injection of the bacterial lysate (n=12). Cytokines as well as parameters of haemostasis were determined; baseline values were slightly elevated due to the underlying disease. Cytokine increase began 1.5 h following the bacterial lysate injection. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) peaked at 60-fold increased values ca. 3 h following the Picibanil injection. During the fever maximum (ca. 4.5h after injection) interleukin 6 (IL-6) also reached a maximum with ca. 300-fold elevated values whereas changes in IL-t, IL-2 and IL-4 were negligible. Concomittant/y, haemostasis was activated without any relevant consumption. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, prothrombin fragments and fibrinopeptide A rapidly increased, peaked with 3.5 to 8-fold elevated values 6 to 7 hours after injection and declined to needy initial values 18 hours later. The strong parallelism of these 3 parameters must be emphazised. Analogously to changes in TNF, these increases were comparable but were more pronounced (in level and length) after injection of endotoxin containing lysates than after grampositive bacterial lysates. Fibrin degradation products (FbDP) increased 4.5 to 6 hours after injection up to 2-fold values. FgDP increased simultaneously, declined neady to initial values and increased once more to the 1.3-fold after 24 hours. Without a pdor decline, fibdnogen began to increase 12 h after injection. Protein C declined by 15% whereas antithrombin III remained unchanged. The number of platelets fell by 12%, their activation was measured by means of flow cytometry analysis. A/together, these results provide further insights into the dynamic process of haemostasis activation and the relevance of markers for thrombinaemia and fibrinaemia. Hypercoagulable state after surgery was reported as a reason for postoperative thromboembolic complication. To investigate the contribution of extrinsic pathway to thrombosis the tissue factor (TF) and factor VII level was determined in the plasma of patients after abdominal surgery. Tissue factor is constitutively present in several tissues such as epithelal tissues, brain and placenta, but it is normally not expressed on cells within the vasculature. On monocytes and endothelial cells TF is expressed only as a reaction to inflammatory and immunological stimulation. The plasma concentration of TF is enhanced in several patients with thromboembolic diseases as well as in patients with hypereholesteraemia. In this study, alterations of TF release into plasma after tissue injury during surgery was investigated. \"IT and, in addition, factor VII were detected using a sandwich ELI-SA with monoclonal antibodies. Plasma was collected: a) the day before surgery, b) intraoperatively, c) one day and d) five days postoperatively. In contrast to the reported increase of TF expression on monocytes after surgery, the plasma levels of TF were not elevated. Factor VII was reduced in about 70% of the patients intraoperatively. Pretratment values were restored between day 1. and day 5 after surgery. This was correlated with factor VII-activity measurements.",

The evaluation of factor VII showed a decrease that might be caused by consumption in relation to TF expressed on monocytes or endothelial cell. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by an excessive vasoconstriction of the cutaneous circulation of the extremities, that is reported to be due either to increased sympathetic tone or to abnormal aneriolar vasoreactivity. This study was aimed to investigate, by the study of (3H)NA kinetics, whether the sympathetic system plays a different role in the pathogenesis of vasospastic attacks in patients with primary (PRP) or secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (SRP). Ten PRP patients (8 females, 2 males, aged 38+8), 10 SRP patiettts (6 females, 4 males aged 40+10) and 10 controls of equivalent age were studied. During (3,H)NA infusion, at the opposite arm HBF was evaluated by strain-gauge plethysmography (Periflow SU4, Janssen, Belgium) and blood samples were simultaneously taken from the radial artery, the antecubital vein and a vein of the back of the hand under basal conditions (15 min from the start of infusion), 2 and 10 min after the beginning of a 2 minlasting cold pressor test (CPT). Plasma NA concentration was assayed by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Under basal conditions HBF was not significantly different in the 3 groups, whereas after CPT HBF significantly decreased only in PRP and SRP patients (from 3.0l+0.6 ml/100ml/min to 2.5+0.3 ml/100ml/min and from 3.04+0.7 ml/100ml/min to 2.6+0.4 ml/100ml/min respectively) (p<0.0I). In PRP patients regional NA spillover was higher than in controls both in basal conditions (p<0.01) and~during CPT (p<0.001); on the contrary in SRP patients basal regional NA spillover was similar to that of controls but significantly lower than in PRP patients (p<0.05). After sympathetic stimulation NA spillover became significantly higher in SRP patients than in controls (p<0.05) but continued to be significantly lower than in PRP patients (p<0.01); in fact the percentage increments in NA spillover induced by CPT in controls, PRP and SRP patients were 28.5+6.3, 42.7+11.2 and 34.1+--9.7% respectively . No significant difference was found in (3H)NA regional extraction, total (3H)NA clearance and spillover among the 3 groups throughout the test. Present results suggest that the vasospastic attacks of primary or secondary Raynaud's phenomenon have different pathogenesis: the enhanced activity of the sympathetic nervous system plays a primary role in the primary Raynaud's phenomenon, while an altered local vasoreactivity seems to be a prominent feature of the secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.",

The level of FXIII was 105,8% in the controls, in patients with M.Crohn or Colitis ulcerosa 77,7% and in diabetics 117,4%. In patients who suffered from macro~giopathy the level was 125,5% (n=30) , while it was 129% when there was a nephropathy (n=27), 119% (n=27) in cases with retinopathy and 130% in hypertensive patients (n=16 Severe depression of AT III activity (< 30 %), fibrinogen (< 2 g/l), increase of bilirubin and serum creatinine at admission are most pronounced in the group with AFLP.

We conclude that a detailed examination of coagulation parameters is an important tool in the differential diagnosis of AFLP and HELLP.

In accordance with a dramatic decrease of ATIII (30 to 40%), these data show that after reperfusion a massive activation of coagulation occurs, which after consumption of the inhibitor potential leads to a hypercoaguable state and an increased risk for formation of thrombi during at least the first week.

These episodes were accompanied by e.g. disturbed wound healing. Therefore, complement parameters might be a useful tool for early diagnosis of critical episodes after transplantation. But this needs further investigations. To investigate a possible role of the fibrinolytic system for hemostatic complications we measured tPA-and PAI-I antigen levels in 24 patients. Materials and methods: Citrated blood samples were taken before (day -8), during (day -5) and after conditioning (day -1), before transplantation (day O) and weekly after BMT (day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35) . TPA-and PAI-I antigen were measured by commercially available enzymimmunoassays (Tint Elize PAl-l, Imulyse tPA, Biopool, Umea, Sweden). Results: After BMT the lowest tPA-and PAl-1-1evels were analysed on day 7 (tPA 14,42 +/-6,80 ng/ml; PAI-I 16,80 +/-10,44 ng/ml) followed by a continous rise to day 35 (tPA 34,26+/-27,14 ng/ml; PAI-I 44,78+/-37,46 ng/ml). The highest pretransplant tPA level (64,5 ng/ml) was measured in a patient presenting with hemorrhagic cystitis on day -I (mean 21,93+/-14,21 ng/ml). A very high tPA-level (58,5 ng/ml) was seen in another patient presenting with joint bleeding with normal tPA levels up to that time. The highest PAI-I antigen levels (peak 213,3 ng/ml) were found in two patients with venocclusive disease of the liver. These data suggest a role of the fibrinolytic system in hemostatic complications after BMT. Patients with liver cirrhosis demonstrate ccmplexe coagulation disturbances. Thus, we studied the hemostatic system in coagulating native whole blood. In this in-vitromodel the concentrations of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) as a marker of t~urombin activity as well as of platelet factor 4 (PF 4) -secreted in the release reaction -was determined over a 14-minutes incubation period. Healthy controls (n=35) demonstrated a parallel course of both parameters. Initially, the concentrations of FPA and PF 4 were low (\"slow phase\") followed by a marked increase (\"rapid phase\") after 5.4+1.4 (x_+SD) minutes (FPA} and 5.8+I .5 minutes (PF 4), respect. In the cirrho{ic patients (n=28) the FPA generation was inhibited during the ccl%i01ete incubation time, the beginning of the rapid ~hase was delayed (7.3_+I .6 rain. ; p 0.05 vs. ctrls.) ~ ~ PF 4 concentrations were unchanged ccnloared to the controls during the slow phase, but they were diminished in the rapi~ phase. Thrcmbocytopenic patients (platelet count 10 /ul) showed clearly inhibited PF 4 concentrations during both phases compared to the controls. Though, the FPA generation did not differ from the controls and was sionificantly elevated ccmpared to t/he patients with a platelet count 10\"/ui. In sum: Patients with liver cirrhosis demonstrate an inhibition of the FPA generatien and -to a lower extentof the PF 4 secretion. The underlying cause is ment to be a decreased synthesis of coac~llation factors leading to a diminished thrcmbin-induced platelet activation. The distinct inhibition of the PF 4 secretion in thrcmbopenic patients is caused by.. the existing platelet deficiency as well as by. the elevated FPA generation. This results in a stimulated ~in-induced platelet activity and can be postulated as a hint for hypercoagulability. Even today despite heparin prophylaxis venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are rather commonly diagnosed as postoperative 'complications'. Depending on the \"severity\" of the operation (i.e. traumatization of tissue and duration of operation) a variable incidence of thromboembolic complications is observed. We therefore chose 3 different kinds of operations: 1) endoscopic cystectomy (assumed,low grade of traumatization), 2) hemicolectomy or anterior rectum resection (high grade) and 3) thyreoidectomy (intermediate grade of severity). We studied coagulation parameters at the following times: a) 1 day preop., b) directly before starting anaesthesia, c) 1 to 2 hrs after the beginning of the actual operative procedure (intraop.), d) at the end of the operation (skin closure), e) 2 hrs postop., f) 1 day, g) 2 days, h) 4 days, and finally i) 5 days later. 30 patients (12 male, 18 female, aged 25 to 83 years) have been included in this study. Fibrinogen clotting activity values moderately decreased during surgery ~nd then in~re,.q~ed as an acute ohase orotein~ Fibrinmonomers only showed a slight increase post'operat{vely (g,h), whereas Ddimers already started to increase slowly 2 hours postoperatively (e) until the end of the observation interval (i). TAT complexes already rose intraop. (c) to a maximum on the first postop, day (d), in order to fall in an oscillating manner on the following days. Total plasminogen activators (PA) did not drop until 2 hrs postop. (e) and continued to fall during the first 24 hrs (f), in order to rise again afterwards even above the initial values (g). PAI-1 activity increased between 2 and 24 hrs postop., then dropped, but increased again on the 5th postop, day to levels above the initial value. All findings described were significant comparing initial values with other values at p<.05-.001. Thus according to our results a maximum of thrombophilic activity is observed between 2 hrs and 1 day postop.. This is furthermore supported by parallel investigations concerning hypercoagulability in total hip replacement. class NYHA III-IV, to find out whether there is evidence of increased thrombin activity. Six of the patients were female, the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 54,3~16,6 mmHg and the mean cardiac index was 1,41~0,22 ml/min/m 2. We determined blood levels of fibrin degradation products (FEDP) and fibrinogen degradation products (FGDP), as well as the prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F 1+2) and thrombinantithrombin III complex (TAT) by specific enzyme immunoassays. In six of eight patients FBDP was measured in the normal range (<500 ug/l) and elevated in the remaining two patients to 1058 ug/l respectively 3039 ug/l. FGDP was within normal range (<500 ug/l) in seven of eight patients, in one case elevated to 658 ug/l. F 1+2 was found to be normal (<I,i nmol/l) in all patients. There was no increase of TAT in any of these patients. In conclusion, no evidence of increased thrombin activity could be found with the methods used in this study in patients with PPH. X-linked sdrenoleukodystrophy (AID) is a metabolic disorder character'=ed by accumulation of saturated very long fatty acids (VLFA; hexacoeanoic acid C 26:0) in brain and adrenal glands, Oemyelinetion is usually ~al within several yearn after onset of neurological symptoms. At present, the only therapy which may prevent progression of demyelination is a diet of osllc (C 18:1) and erucio (C 22:1) acids, To date, side effects of this diet have not been descdbed. We have studied prospectively 16 patients with ALD in whom a diet of oelic and srucic acid diet was initiated (without any other medication). On this diet, 3 patients (from 2 different families) developed a marked thrombocytopenia with platelet counts between 37,000 and 67,000/~ and abnormally large platelets (mean platalet volume: 11.6-12.8 ft; normal: 7,5+1.5 ~). Five to 8 d\u2022s after discontinuation of therapy platelet counts ratumsd to normal and declined again after continuation of diet. No bleeding symptoms were prasent ir the 3 Individuals at any time. In accord wP,.h this, repeat bleeding ~me was not prolonged (4.0-6.5 rain; normal: 4.5-&2.5 m~n) despite thrombecytopsnia, indicating an increased hsmostatio capacity of circulating platelets. Pseudothrembocytoponia wss e~cluded, Bone-marrow biopsy revealed magakeryocytic hyperpMsi& while erythrocytol~esis and granulocytopeleeis were not affected. Platelet reactive autoantibodias directed to glycoproteln (GP) IIb411a or GPIb-IX were not detectable on the patients' autologous platelats, as evaluated by monoclonal antibody-specifiC immobilization of platelat antigens, In vitro platelet aggregation and secretion studies did not exhibit functional abnormalities. In addition, flow cytometric analysis with FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies showed normal expression of the GPIIb-Illa and QPIb4X complexes on the platelet sun'ace, These results indicate that therapy with oslic and erucic acids sen be associated with thrombocytop~nia due to in~reasad peripheral platelat destruction. A drug-induced autoantibody mechanism could not be demonstrated, it is more likely that the augmented intake of C 18;1 and C 22:1 fatty acids has direct effects on the platelet plasma membrane composition. This hypot~ needs to be explored by lipid analysis. In patients with liver cirrhosis a decrease of the coagulant potential is well documented and has been linked to the high bleeding tendency among these patients.",

The wide range of processes entailing this activity includes fibrinolysis, extracellular matrix degradation involving cell migration during embryogensis, angiogenesis, inflammation, tumor metastasis and proenzyme activation such as that of collagenase and stromelysin. Plasminogen activators (PA) play a pivotal role in these processes by converting an ubiquitous proenzyme plasminogen to plasmin. Reflecting the wide range of PA biological activities, expression of PA genes is highly regulated and modulated by a variety of extracellular stimuli such as hormones, growth factors, retinoic acid and tumor promoters depending on the cell type. We have performed a detailed analysis of the cis-acting sequences involved in regulation of the hu-PA gene and found that a hu-PA minimal promoter is regulated by a constitutively active remote enhsncer (-2000/-1870) . We show th~ transcription of the hu-PA gene which is highly expressed in transformed cells and tumours is efficiently activated by TPA and nuclear [c-Jun, c-Ets-1 (p68), c-Ets-1 (p54), c-Ets-2] and cellular oncoproteins (Ha-ras, v-Src, v-Mos, polyoma middle T-antigen, v-rat). Protein-DNA binding and mutational analysis show that the enhancer is at least composed of two separate DNA elements: Ets/AP-1 and a second AP-1 site. Transient expression of hu-PA enhancer/CAT reporter gene showed an interplay of these two elements. Band shift experiments revealed two distinct protein-DNA complexes. In general these results lead to the conclusion that activating oncoproteins participate in the mechanism by which hu-PA gene expression is deregulated in transformed cells.",

            "text": "Steroids and related hormones play an important role in regulating development, differentiation and homeostasis. The hormones exert their regulatory effects by binding to a superfamily of intracellular receptors, which are direct modulators of gene transcription. The human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a member of this superfamily. GR has been shown to repress expression of a group of physiologically important target genes, which code for metalloproteases such as collagenase and stromelysin. The expression of the hman u-PA is known to be repressed by glucocorticoids. We present evidence that the target for the negative effect of glucocorticoids is the constitutively active hu-PA-enhancer (-2000/-1870) which is the target for several nuclear and cellular oncoproteins and tumor promoter phorbol ester (I'PA). Negative regulation is due to repression of c-Jun/AP-1 activity through the GR. This inhibition is independent on GR-DNA binding to a GR response element (GRE). A hormone-independent activator GR is a moderate represser of the hu-PA-enhancer whereas a DNA-binding mutant GR (point mutation) shows significantly decreased represser activity. The GR antagonises in a hormon-dependant manner the induction of the huPA-enhancer by oncoproteins. These observations that the GR inhibits the huPA-enhancer provides a framework for understanding the opposing effects of growth factors, inflammatory mediators and steroid hormones. Aberant expression of the u-PA gene has been implicated in pathological conditions such as inflammation, arthritis and tumour invasiveness. The anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids could be explained in part by inhibition of the AP-1dependent u-PA-enhancer. Conclusions: Patients with severe disease have somewhat lower F XIII levels, without relation to activation markers of baemostasis or neutrophils, and mean values remaining normal. The data would be compatible with an enhanced local turnover in the more intensely inflamed tissues. The previously reported favourable influence of F XIII concentrates might be due to a local effect upon wound healing.",

Introduction: Assessment of inflammatory activity in children with Crohn disease is difficult. Most activity indices developed for adults are inappropriate for children, since evaluation of clinical symptoms as a part of the index is inaccurate. A single laboratory parameter might give a better estimate of the inflammatory process. Several parameters, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and semm orosomucoid, have been suggested as discriminatory variables of disease activity. However, these parameters are not directly associated with the inflammatory lesion. Von Willebrand factor (vWF:Ag), synthesized in endothelial ceils, which are involved in the granulomatous inflammatory process, may give a better insight into activity of Crohn disease. Patients and methods: Twenty-eight children (age 4-20 ys, mean 13.5 ys) with proven Crohn disease (7 children with inactive, 9 with slight, 7 with moderate and 5 with severe disease activity) were examined for factor VIII activity (F VIII:C), yon Willebrand factor (vWF:Ag) and ristocetin-cofactor activity (vWF:Rcof).The factor VIII coagulation proteins were correlated with disease activity index according to van Hees and were compared with inflammatory parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Creactive protein and orosomucoid.Thirty children were' examined as healthy controls. Results and Conclusion : A highly significant elevation of all components of F VIII complex were found in patients with moderate and severe disease activity. In patients with mild and inactive disease, all coagulation activities were normal. Plasma levels of all components of F VIII complex showed a positive correlation with the graded activity index of van Hees. Among the factor VIII proteins, vWF:Ag correlated best with van Hees disease activity index (p < 0.001 ). Since acute phase proteins are produced by liver cells, whereas vWF:Ag is synthesized by endothelial cells, we postulate that this coagulation factor is highly sensitive in reflecting the inflammatory process in the intestine. The balance of generation and proteolytic degradation of fibrin in the peritoneal cavity plays an important role in the long term outcome of renal replacement therapy by CAPD. Increased procoagulant and/or reduced fibrinolytic activity are associated with fibrin-induced adhesion phenomena and the risk of subsequent peritoneal fibrosis. We have examined the peritoneal effluent from 21 CAPD patients for markers of protbrombin (F1+2 fragment, TAT complex) and fibrinogen (fibrin monomer, fibrinognn-, fibrin-degradation products) turnover using ELISA systems. The peritoneal effluents from 18 patients without a peritonitis episode during the last 12 months were compared to the effluents from 3 patients with bacterial peritonitis, 8 samples were obtained before and 31 samples during therapy with antibiotics and beparin. Although without clinical or laboratory signs of peritonitis patients had high levels of F1+2 fragment (2.2+_2.4 nm01/l), TAT cemplex(17:t:15 ng/ml), soluble fibrin (166d:140 I~g/ml and FbDp (6.35:5.7 I~g/mi) in the peritoneal effluent indicating a high turnover of prothrombin and fibrinogen. Patients with bacterial peritonitis showed even higher levels of F1+2 fragment (4.6+_2.9 nmolfl), TAT Complex (49+_25 ng/ml), soluble fibrin (880-k_793 lig/mi) and FbDp (14__71~g/ml),which decreased significantly below plasma levels without peritonitis after antibiotic and anticoagulant therapy. In conclusion we found considerably high levels of markers for prothrombin and fibrinogen turnover in the peritoneal cavity of CAPD patients without and even higher levels in patients with bacterial peritonitis. These elevated levels decreased significantly during antibiotic and anticoagulant therapy. The diagnostic or prognostic value of these parameters as well as their role for therapy monitoring has to be elucidated.",

Hitherto, the contribution of these systems to CP has been widely neglected. We expect that the results will lead to discussions on new therapeutic concepts for patients with chronic polyarthritis. Urokinase-fype plasminogen activator (uPA) is known to be very important in proCesses such as tissue remodeling and cell migration (including metastasis). The uPA is secreted by a variety of cells as an inactive zymogen (pro-uPA) and previous results have shown that the initial activation of pro-uPA might take peace exclusively on the uPA-receptor. The part o! uPA responsible for binding to the receptor is located in the aminoterminal domain. In the human system if has been shown that enzymatically generated, or recombinant, amine terminal fragment (ATF) of the uPA competes with uPA for binding to the uPA receptor in vitro, thereby inhibiting the ceil s~rface mediated plasminogen activation. We are investigating the effect of expressing a recombinant murine ATF in transgenic mice The DNA construction we have used to generate transgenic mice consists of a albumin prorr~lerlenhancer region which directs high expression in the liver, driving a modified murine uPA gene including seven exon's encoding the receptor binding domain of the murine uPA, a short region encoding an antigenic octapeptide (for which we have a monoclonal antibody, \"FLAG\" ), and a noncoding region from fhe human growth hormone gene. We have generated 26 independent tranegenic mice with this construct. The expression of the transgene have been analyzed by Northern blotting and the level of ATF in the serum by ELISA. In the highest expressing line, the level of serum ATF exceeds 2O0ng/ml. The ATF does not seem to hays any apparent effect on the animal We are currently studying the status ot the uPA receptor on the cells in the blood stream and the effect ol ATF on metastasis of the Lewis Lung carCinoma. Plasminogen activators (PAs) are enzymes synthesized by most cell -types in response to hormonally or developmentally programmed stimuli. They convert the omnipresent proenzyme plasminogen into plasmin (a protein of trypsinlike specifidity) endowing cells with a mechanism for the generation of localized proteolysiS within the context of migration, tissue growth and remodelling. In all mammalian species investigated so far there are two PAs : tissue type PA (t-PA) and urinary-type PA (u-PA,also known as urokinase}.",

Histological analysis demonstrated that the 3 kb promoter element is active mainly in neural ectoderm derivatives whereas expression in the developing vascular systems is observed only after considerable deletioo of the 3 kb promoter fragment. These data suggest a role of t-PA in the proteolysis required during cell migration and organogenesis, a function so far mainly attributed to u-PA.The promoter deletion experiments indicate the presence of tissue specific enhancer/ silencer elements the precise location of which remains to be established. This transgenic model provides the experimental basis for detailed analysis of promoter function during complex developmentally programmed phenomena such as the ontogeny of the mammalian nervous and vascular systems. The expression of uPA in mammals is mainly related to celt migration and tissue remodelling such as involution of breaSlS oiler lactation, wound healing and metastasis of tumors. An enhancer located approximately 2.4 kb upstream of the uPA gene transcription start site is necessary for the induction of uPA by EGF in murine keratinocytes in culture. We have prepared transgenic mice with constructs carrying the 3 kb control region with or without a deletion of the enhancer, fused to the E. colipgalactosidase gone. Embryos from the different trangenio lines have been stained with the LB-galactosidase specific x-gel at different stages of development. None of the embryos of the 3 lines with the wild-type construct revealed any staining, whereas embryos from 2 of the 3 lines with the de~etior~ construct did. qr~ one of the tines, embryos where stained blue from clay 9.5 p.c. in the myotome part of the somites and later in migration and fusing myoblasts. In the other line with the deletion construct, embryOS at day 12 p.o. were stained blue in two structures on both sides of the midline in the masencephalen. 6 weeks old mice from each transgenic line were used to test for wound-healing response. In the wounds from one of the lines with the wild type construct, positive x-gal staining was seen around the edges. None of the transgenic lines containing the deletion construct stained positively. The results show that 3 kb 5' flanking sequence including the 90 basepairs enhancer is sufficient for uPA-expression in migrating keratinocy~es during wound-healing, and possibly support the view that the enhancer is necessary ~or uPA expression in keratinecytes They also suggest that the enhancer may have a role in the specific expression of uPA, since 2 ot the 3 lines with the deletion construct revealed an abnormal expression pattern. The fibrinolytic system is involved in a wide variety of biological phenomena such as thrombolysis, tissue remodeling, metastasis, angiogenesis, wound healing, embryogenesis, embryo implantation, etc. D~spite the vast literature on the in vitro mechanisms of action of the plasminogen activators tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and their principal inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-I), a number of important questions remain unanswered about their intra-and extravascular role in viva. For example, it is not known what the differential role of t-PA and u-PA is in endogenous thrombolysis; whether deficient fibrinolysis plays a causal role in the process of atherosclerosis; and what the physiological significance of the fibrinolytic system is in repcudu~ion, embryo implantation and metastasis in viva.",

It has been demonstrated that APA confers an increased risk of thromboembolic complication to LES patients, but no demonstration of such an increase has been given for idiopathic APS.

LA inhibit phospholipid-depandent coagulation reactions in plasma, whereas aCL bind to anionic phospholipids in the immunoassay. Recently, our group has demonstrated that LA and aCL antibodies recognize 2 different lipid-bound/protein complexes, i.e. lipid-bound/human prothrombin and lipid-boand/132-Glycoprotein I (B2-GPI), respectively. These data refer to aPL of the IgG isotype. Conversely, little is known about the immunological targets of IgM aPL, the mor*, so since they are not reported to be related with arterial and/or venous thrombosis, repeated abortions and thrombocytopenia like IgG aPL. Therefore, we evaluated the immunological characteristics of IgM with aPL activity, purified from the plasma of 3 patients (2 suffering from Waldenstrom's disease and one from cryoglobulinemia, none of them with history of thrombosis) by gel filtration chromatography. Two monoclonal and lpolyclonal IgM preparations were obtained. One monoclonal and the polyclonal IgM's were able to prolong dRVVT of human (68.7 and 52.6 sec vs 32.1 see of control monoclonal IgM) but not bovine (35.1 and 33.4 see vs 34.0 see) plasma and failed to bind to anionic phospholipids in ELISA. Thus, they behaved as LA antibodies, directed against the complex of lipid-bound human pmthrombin. The other monoclonal IgM preparation bound to eardiolipin and phosphatidylserine in ELISA and was able to prolong the dRVVT of human (95.7 vs 32.1 see) as well as bovine (101.1 vs 34.0 see) plasma. This prolongation was abolished upon preincubation of the normal human plasma with anti-B2-GPI antiserum, indicating that this IgM was directed against lipid/B2-GPI complex. In conclusion, monoand plyclonal IgM's aPL display similar immunological pattern as previously shown for IgG's aPL. Not all LA patients, however, have a history of thrombosis or will develop thrombosis in the future. Thus, in a retrospective study on 46 LA patients with or without LA-essociated thrombophilia, it was investigated whether the strength of LA measured by routinely used functional and immunological LA tests is a useful parameter to identify LA patients with a high thrombotic risk. The data obtained demonstrate no correlation between the incidence of thrombosis and the concentration of LA antibodies, indicating that routinely used LA essays are rather qualitative than quantitative. Since impaired thrombemodulin (TM) activity in the presence of LA has been suggested to be one of the main causes for LA-associated thrombophilia, it was explored whether the rate of TM inhibition could be correlated to the incidence of thrombosis in LA patients. TM activity was measured using an endothelial cell dependent PC activation assay. Only 2 out of the 46 LA patients showed decreased TM activity. Moreover, in one patient a TM-autoantibody of IgG subclass was identified. Although impaired TM activity in both patients was associated with str~nw tl'gambophil~a, these data indicate that acquirGd dysfunction of ,'~,~ is neither a common feature nor a main cause of thrombophilia in LA patients, Searching for another explanation for I_A-associated thrombophitia it became obvious that activated protein C (APC) requires although anionic phospholipide to achieve its full biological activity. Thus, impaired catalytic activity of APC could be a result of LA antibodies. To verify this hypothesis, an assay for the determination of APC activity in LA plasma samples was developed. APC generated from purified PC was added (0.5 p.M and 1,0 I~M) to LA plasma. After incubation of different times, APC activity waS measured via the rate of FVlll degradation by a one-stage clotting assay using FVlll-deficiant plasma. In all 46 patients studied, a strong correlation between APC inhibiting activity and the strength of thrombophilia was found. From these data it is concluded that LA prevents the formation of the APC complex essential for rapid proteolysis of factors Va and Villa. We suggest that persistence of factors Va and Villa in blood creates a hypercoagulable state responsible for thrombephilia in LA patients. Most importantly, however, the new test described offers a new opportunity to identify LA patients who are at high thrombotic risk.

From human blood samples highly purified lymphocyte and monocyte populations have been prepared by FicolI-Hypaque density gradient centfifugation and adherence to plastic plates; the B and T lymphocyte fractions were separated by cytoadherence to neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells. Mixtures of monocytes and lymphocyte fractions (T and B identified by specific monoclonal fluorescent antibodies: OKT3, OKB19, OKM14, Ortho Diagnostic) were than coincubated for 4 hours at 37 ~C and PCA was measured in a one-stage clotting assay. Several studies have demonstrated the capacity of allogeneically stimulated T-helper lymphocytes to induce human monocyte procoagulant activity. In experiments with murine T cell clones it has been observed that monocyte PCA induction was due to the lymphocytes Thelper type 1 subset. Human T cell clones with T-helper type 1 (Th-1) or type 2 (Th-2) functional pattern have been identified more recently. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different stimuli on human T-helper subsets capacity el inducing monocyte PCA. Human Th-1 and Th-2 cell clones, derived from peripheral blood of healthy donors, have been stimulated for 24 hours by PHA (1%) in the presence of antigen present cells or by PMA (10 ng/ml) and monoclonal antibody anti-CD3 (100 ng/ml). After removing the supernatant the T cells were coincubated for 8 hours at 37 ~C with monocytes, lreshly prepared from human peripheral blood by FicolFHypaque density gradient centrifugation and adherence to plastic plates. The cell cultures have been analyzed for PCA characterized as tissue factor. Our data indicate thaf monocyte PCA in the presence of PHA stimulated Th-1 type clones is five-fold higher than after coincubation with PHA stimulated Th-2 type clones. Whereas upon exposure of T cell clones to maximal stimulation with PMA and anti-CD3 diffrence between Th-1 type and Th-2 type clones becomes less evident. These results suggest that in humans monocyte PCA might be induced predominantly by type I T-helper lymphocytes under physiological conditions.

Schellenberg, (1), Ch. Str6hl (1) Leucocyte proteinases released under various physiological and pathological conditions modulate platelet function. In order to compare human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and cathepsin G (cat G) with respect to proteolyfic action on platelet membrane receptors washed platelets were incubated with the purified enzymes. Membrane glycoproteins (GPs) were analyzed by SDS discelectrophoresis and twodimensional electrophoresis in combination with Western blotting and immunodetection and by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Both proteinases rapidly degrade GP Ib producing an Mr 105,000 fragment removing the N-terminal sequence containing binding sites for yon Willebrand factor and thrombin. Only cat G gives rise to a smaller Mr 78,000 fragment. A concomitant loss of ristocetin-dependent platelet agglutination is observed. In contrast to this close correlation between functional and proteolytic effects there is a rapid expression of fibrinogen receptors (aggregation in response to fibrinogen) by cat G (not by HNE) but only slow degradation of GP lib-Ilia complex. Major proteolytic fragments of GP IIIa appear only after 10 -15 min treatment under our conditions. Thus, leucocyte proteinases seem to exert a sequential effect on platelets: first destruction of receptors for adhesion to subendothelium, expression of fibrinogen receptors and subsequent proteolysis of fibrinogen receptors.",

Binder Granulocyte elastase (GE) is released from leukocytes stimulated by several coagulation factors and functions as proteinase modulating fibrinolytic activity and degrading extracellular matix. Various leukocyte mediated stimuli induce endothelial cells to produce type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAl-1 ); therefore both GE and PAI-I are released upon leukocyte endothelial cell interaction. GE could be shown to cleave and inactivate PAl-1 ; furthermore GE and PAl-1 bind to heparin. While heparin dose not alter functional activity of PAI-I, it decreases GE activity. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of PAI-t on GE heparin interaction. When GE activity was analysed in the presence of PAl-I, heparin had no inhibitory effect, but GE activity was increased. Therefore we investigated the effect of PAl-1 alone on GE activity. When human GE (0.2/~g/ml) w.as inctthated ~.ith PAl-1 (0-200U/ml) in the presence of 0.5M NaCI, GE catalytic activity was significantly increased in a dose-and time-dependent fashion. Maximal stimulation occured after 15 min of preincubation of PAl-1 with GE. Addition of t-PA acclerated the stimulating activity of PAl-1 indicating that t-PA-PAI-1 complexes had stimulating effect on GE activity. This stimulation was also dependent on the ionic strength and was most pronounced at 0.5 M NaC1. Such high ionic strength might occure also locally in vivo, e.g. in the presence of platelets undergoing release reaction. These findings suggest that upon inflammatory conditions not only the plasmin dependent fibrinolytic potential is decreased but also the elastase dependent proteolytic activity is increased.",

To confirm the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, we performed tissue thromboplastin inhibition tests with Thromborel S | and mixing studies basing on the kaolin clotting time of platelet poor plasma. Nine of our 101 patients (8.9 %) revealed positive confirmatory tests, in our mind this high frequency contributes to our sensitive test system.

Significantly lower levels of Cl-inhibitor activity in the graft liver perfusate, which is released from the graft liver vein upon flushing with arterial blood prior to the opening of the hepatocaval anastomosis, have suggested an activation of the kallikreinkininogen system in the graft liver. In addition, previous investigations have demonstrated that aprotinin, a strong inhibitor of kallikrein and plasmin, both activators of single chain u-PA (scu-PA), decreases signs of hyperfibrinolysis in OLT. To evaluate the role of the graft liver in influencing u-PA levels in the patient's systemic circulation we measured scu-PA and twochain u-PA (tcu-PA) levels in the perfusate (P) and in the corresponding systemic circulation immediately after starting reperfusion of the graft liver (S). Both were measured by BIA. During OLT aprotinin was given as bolus (0.5 MilI.KIU, three times)Conclusion: Higher scu-PA and tcu-PA levels in P as compared with S were measurable despite of the diluting effect by the conservation fluid, the starting hepatic clearance and the aprotinin treatment. This strongly suggests synthesis of u-PA by the graft liver.",

Reininger 1, U. Heinzmann 2, L.J. Wurzinger 1 In vivo thrombosis preferentially occurs at arterial curvatures and branchings where vortices within recirculation zones are present. Within these regions the shear forces are low and the blood is retained orders of magnitude longer than within straight vessel sections. Thus, we examined the influence of fluid dynamics on the formation of occluding fibrin thrombi in vitro. T-branchings consisting either of plain glass or with an inner lining of endothelium from human umbilical cord veins were perfused with buffered fibrinogen solutions (3mg/ml). The pressure within the flow system was 120 mmHg and the stationary flow of 20 ml/min was adjusted to form a large recirculation zone opposite the orifice of the side branch. Upstream the branching point fibrin polymerization was induced by injecting a thrombin solution 'to a final concentration of 0.1 to 1 unit/ml. Thrombus growth was registered on-line by video and evaluated after the experiment. After the same time span as indicated by the test tube clotting time (2min +/-lmin) the growth of wall bound fibrin thrombi began at the separation point at the upstream border of the recirculation zone. From here the thrombi grew downstream along the wall and into the flowing fluid occluding up to 80% of the vessel lumen. Thrombi grew at thrombin concentrations > 0.3",

Riess Alloimmunization to leukocyte antigens and probably the platelet-refractory state can be prevented or delayed by the use of leukocyte-reduced platelet concentrates ~PCs). We studied the effect of filtration ~polyester filter FL-]O0, Pall, Dreieich) on the platelet membrane samples [i] were taken from the donors before cytapheresis. The PCs (samples [2]) were equally divided in two parts. One part was filtered immedeately (samples [3]) the other part was stored for 5 days (samples [4]) and then filtered (samples [5]). Samples [6] were taken from the primarily filtered PCs after storage for 5 days. The mean val~es for platelet loss and leukocyte depletion after filtration were 9.3% and 96.8%. The effect of filtration on the expression of platelet membrane glycoproteins was not significant. The mean proportion of platelets which expressed the activation dependent antigens (CD62/CD63) in the donors was 1.7/1.8% [I] and it rose highly significant in the PCs from 12.2/10.6% [2] and 13.o/11.4% [3] to 32.9/31.0% [4] and 32.0/30.3% [6] after storage. Expression of CD42b was significantly lower after storage of the Fcs: mean fluorescence intensity 136,7 [2] and 134,B [3) vs 114.5 [4] and 113.1 [6]. There were no significant differences between samples [4] vs [6] and [5] vs [6]. In conclusion cytapheresis leads to platelet activation and leukocyte-depletion has no significant effect on the further activation during storage of the PCs.

To find out whether this observation could perhaps be explained by a different action of heparin in plasma we examined 23 patients with gallstones and 23 patients with large bowel cancer. Blood was collected preoperatively and a platelet poor plasma was prepared by chill-centrifugation. Unfractionated heparin (Thrombophob) was added to plasma samples with a final concentration of 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 U, 0.1 and 0.2 U/ml respectively. After 30 min the capacity of plasma to inhibit thrombin (TI) added in execesa was measured with a chromogenic substrate assay (heparin low dose test, B6hringer-Mannheim).There was no difference in AT III activity and PF4 concentration (p=.24, p=.36). With respect to antl-thrombin action plasma of patients with large bowel cancer significantly reduces the activity of unfractionated heparin.

Grimm, G. Schwieder and T. WagnerWe analyzed the results of thrombolytic therapies in deep vein thrombosis of the legs fromMay 1985 until  September 1991. Until June 1988 86 patients were treated with a standard dose of urokinase (UK; 2.4 Mill. U/d) for a mean of 12 days. Within a dose finding multicenter study starting in July 1988 ii patients were treated with rtPA 0.5 or 0.75 mg/kg/d and, starting March 1989, 36 patients with rtPA 0.25 or 0.375 mg/kg/d. Therapy generally lasted for 7 days. Furthermore 40 patients underwent thrombolytic therapy with ultra-highdose-streptokinase (UHSK) using 9 Mill. u/6h on 3 consecutive days. Ascending phlebography was performed initially and after termination of the therapy. Complete clot dissolution without thrombotic ~esidues of any hemodynamic relevance resulted in 33% O f all evaluated patients: UK 27%, UHSK 52.5%, rtPA 2S~. Lysis oz more than 50% of the original clots was obtained in 28% of all cases: UK 24%, UHSK 27.5%, rtPA 34%. Premature termination because of severe bleeding during therapy had to be noted in 8.2% (n=23) of 280 initially treated patients: UK 13/149 (8.7%), UHSK 2/66 (3%), rtPA 0.5/0.75 5/16 (31%), rtPA 0.25/0.375 3/38 (7.9%) One fatal pulmonary embolism occured under therapy with UHSK (1.5 %) in a patient with leg and iliac vein thrombosis. Conclusion: i. UHSK seems to be the most effective thrombolytic agent in deep vein thrombosis, but contains a higher risk of pulmonary embolism in iliac vein thrombosis. 2. rtPA in the higher dosage has an unacceptable bleeding risk. 3. rtPA in the lower dosage is more effective than urokinase and much less expensive.Department of Internal Medicin, Medical University of L~beck, Germany PA W.

Tests were performed on citrated plasma obtained before surgery. The occurrence of post-operative thrombosis was assessed by the 1251fibrinogen uptake test, confirmed by venography. The baseline levels of both TAT complex and F1+2 of the patients with cancer were significantly higher than those of 50 control subjeL;ts, sex and age matched, without cancer (p <0.05); in contrast the plasma levels of FVlif and F VIIz ol patients were not statistically different from controls. A total of 9 venous thrombosis (7.6%) was detected in the group of tumor patients within ten days following surgery. The relative risk (RR) of thrombosis was calculated for the above parameters. The RR was increased of 7.5 times for TAT values_> 3.5 ng/ml and of 1.7 times for F1+2 levels >-1.1 nM; no RR increase was evident for F VII. This study confirms that laboratory evidence of hypercoagulation is a frequent finding in cancer patients.

Concerning our data there is no hint of a lack of FXIII in diabetic patients, even after a long period of the disease and if there are diabetic late complications. It even looks like as if there is an elevation of FXIII in some patients. The coincidence with cholesterol and fibr~en has to be checked in further studies as well as the level of FXIII in arteriosclerotic patients, and in patients with hypercholesterolemia without diabetes.

The contributing role of haemorheological factors is becoming more and more widely accepted in the pathophisiology of cardiovascular disease. To further study the telationshil~ between endogenous opiod peptides and huemorheologiosl factors, we have tested the changes of whole blood and plasma viscosity, platelet aggregation, plasma fibrinogen level and huematocrit value induced by an infusion of syntetic haman g-Endorphin (~,-E) at the rate of 500 ug/h for l hour on both 8 patients with essential hypertension and 8 (age, sex and B.M.I, matched) normoteusive subjects. patients were submitted to an another infusion of B-E preceded by an intravenous bolus of the specific ,u-receptor opioid antagonist naloxoue (5 nag in 5 rain) on different days and in random order. The infusion of B-E significantly (p< 0.05 or less) increased whole blood viscosity and platelet aggregation in hypertensive but not in normotensive subjects. The increase was reversible since whole blood viscosity and platelet aggregation returned to basal values 60 min after B-E infusion. The increased whole bltxxl viscosity but not platelet aggregation was inhibited by pre-treatment with anloxoue. These findings indicate that B-Endorphin may play a role in the haemorheological changes of hypertensive patients and a different receptorial mechanism is involved in B-Endorphin's influence on bloe;d viscosity and platelet aggregation.

Seitz, F. Leugner, M. Katschinski, M. Kraus (*), A. Immel, M. Maasberg and R. Egbring Background: Factor Xlll (F XIll) is important for fibrin stabilization and wound healing. Several authors found reduced plasma F XIII levels in colitis ulcerosa (CU) and Morbus Crohn (MC). In pilot studies, patients with active CU and severe bloody diarhea responded favourably to F XIII concentrates. Patients and Methods: 119 patients with endoscopic evidence of CU or MC were included in a prospective, diagnostic study. Severity of disease was assessed in CU patients according modified Truelove criteria, in MC patients according to the CDAI index. Plasma levels of F XIII, TAT, D-Dimer and neutrophil elastase complex were determined. Results: Patients with severe CU (n=12) compared with moderate CU (n=24) had significantly lower F XIII (87.5\u2022 vs. 105.The F XIII levels were neither correlated to TAT, nor to D-Dimer and elastase. The patients with severe MC (n=37) also had lower F XIII (97.8\u2022 vs. 122.5\u2022 p=0.0059), not related to TAT, D-Dimer or elastase, and higher D-Dimer (495.1\u2022 vs. 284.1\u2022 p=0.0068) levels than those with moderate disease (n=46).",

It is of clinical relevance, whether plasma levels of activation markers are related te clinical features such as tumor stage or response to treatment. Patients and Methods: In 47 lung cancer patients (15 SCLC, 32 NSCLC), the plasma levels of TAT, F]+2, plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP), and D-Dimer were assayed by ELISA before commencing specific antineoplastic treatment. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between limited (LD) and extensive disease (ED) patients (TAT 3.5\u2022 vs. 8.1\u2022 p=O.O21; D-Dimer 716\u2022 vs. 1143\u2022 p=0.014) , and between patients reaching complete or partial remission after treatment (GR) and the patients with bad response (BR) to therapy (TAT 2.8\u2022 vs. 7.7\u2022 p=0.0047, D-Dimer 557\u2022 vs. 1146\u2022 p=0.0013 ). Statistically significant differences were also found for the molecular ratios of markers, with higher TAT/FI+2, TAT/PAP, as well as D-Dimer/PAP ratios both in ED and in BR patients. Conclusions: The data indicate that in patients with advanced lung cancer and poor prognosis there is a more pronounced activation of haemostasis. The markers TAT and D-Dimer might be helpful prognostic parameters. Furthermore, the interaction between coagulation, fibrinolysis and inhibitors, as reflected by the molecular ratios of their respective activation markers, appears to be altered in advanced lung cancer. In septic patients disturbances in the haemostatic system are observed during the development of multiple organ failure (MOP). 28 septic patients of an internal intensive care unit were observed over a period of 15 days or until death. Sepsis war diagnosed according to the criteria of the Veterans Administration Systemic Sepsis Cooperative Study Group.Patients were classified with respect to severeness and extent of organ failure by the APACHE II-score and the MOF-score as well as in septic and no more septic patient s during the observation time.Among other parameters there were determined interleukin 6, neopterin, CRP, elastase, factor XII, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor, D-dimers, thrombin-entithrombin complexes, and protein C. There was a strong correlation between APACHE IIand MOP-score. All parameters determined from plasma correlated with the severeness of the disease and with extent of MOF. Significant differences existed between septic patients and patients which became non septic during the follow up observation period. Interleukin 6 and neopterin were significant related to parameters of the fibrinolytic system. Fibrinolytic activity could not be detected in plasma. D-dimers probably indicating fibrinolysis in the microcirculation were present in each case.The results indicate that coagulation and fibrinolysis may act as mediators in the development of organ dysfunction in septic patients.

            "text": "During our studies on the negative regulation of endothelial thrombomodulin (TM) gene promoter by tumor necrosis factor c~ (TNFa) we identified the TNFcr responsive element (TARE) as protein-binding site for the proto-oncogene products c-Ets-1, which has been identified as the cellular progenitor of the v-Ets-oncogene. The c-Ets-1 proteins are located in the nucleus, bind to DNA in vitro, and function as transcription factors. From our results with TM promoter, we conclude that c-Ets-1 is an important regulator of endothelial gene expression. However, our data suggest that either an endothelial-specific member of the Ets protein family or an Ets-associated factor is involved in the negative regulation of the TM promoter by TNFa. In order to identify these regulatory molecules, we undertook a molecular cloning approach using the among all members of the Ets protein family highly conserved DNA-binding domain (180 base pairs) from the e-Ets-1 Cterminal end as a hybridization probe to screen an endothelial lambdagtl 1 cDNA expression library. Six from eight phages which repeatedly hybridized with the c-Ets-1 AatlI-Bal1180 bp probe under high stringent conditions were purified and further analyzed with restriction enzymes by subcloning into plasmid vectors and DNA sequencing. The resulting contigous DNA sequence and deduced amino acid code revealed 100% identity with the c-Ets-1 p68 eDNA. Currently we are using different conventional cloning procedures and PCR cloning methods to identify additional Ets-like or associated factors in endothelial cells. Thrombomodulin ('FM) is expressed on vascular endothelial cells and plays an important role in the protein C anticoagulant pathway by maintaining the thrombo-resistence of the blood vessel wall. We show that in primary human endothelial cells TM gene transcription is repressed by tumor necrosis factor r (TNFa) through a protein kinase C independent pathway. TNF~ specifically represses the highly active TM promoter in transfection assays. The -76/-56 5'-flanking region of human TM mediates both high basal expression and TNFa repression. Protein-DNA binding and mutation analysis indicate that TNFa repression is mediated by an endothelial-specific member of the ETS domain protein family, hJthough c-Ets-1 (p68 and p54) and c~Ets-2 stimulate the TM promoter through the -76/-56 element, their activity is not suppressed by TNFa. c-Ets-1 can compete and override TNF~ repression in a concentration dependent manner. We propose that either a different cell-specific member of the ETS domain protein family, or an Ets-associated co-factor, is the target of the TNF~ signalling cascade in endothelial cells.Haemostasis Research Unit, Max-Planck-lnstitut fOr physiologische und klinische Forschung, Kerckhoff-K]inik, Bad Nauheim, Germany",
