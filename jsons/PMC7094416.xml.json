            "text": "The most challenging period for young calves is from birth through weaning; during this time calves experience remarkable physiological, metabolic, and environmental changes (Davis and Drackley, 1998). Despite advances in calf nutrition and health, morbidity and mortality are greater during this time than at any other point of the animal\u2019s life (Quigley et al., 2005; NAHMS, 2010). The main causes of mortality during the preweaned period are diarrhea and respiratory problems, with most of the deaths occurring during the first 2 to 3 wk of life (NAHMS, 2010). For the dairy enterprise, decreasing morbidity and mortality is important because of the economic losses associated with treating illnesses, decreased calf performance, and death. Factors associated with morbidity and poor performance during the preweaned period are inadequate feeding, poor management, and the presence of stressors such as cold weather and transport (Wells et al., 1996; Svensson et al., 2006b; Vasseur et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Success in calf rearing is a function of excellent nutrition and management practices that start as soon as the calf is born. Adequate colostrum intake and provision of a dry, comfortable, and clean environment to minimize exposure to pathogens are the first steps to provide better adaptation of the newborn calf to its new environment (Quigley et al., 1995; Godden, 2008). Colostrum-deprived calves exposed to unfavorable conditions (e.g., high pathogen loads, environmental stressors) after birth exhibit greater risk for morbidity and mortality (Quigley et al., 2005; Godden, 2008; Gulliksen et al., 2009). Subsequent nutrition is crucially important to provide all nutrients for proper growth and health; however, adequate nutrition is not enough to ensure proper survival, growth, and health in circumstances where the young calf is immunologically disadvantaged, facing unfavorable environmental conditions, or subjected to other stressors. Transport (Johnston and Buckland, 1976; Odore et al., 2004) and cold weather represent stressors for the young calf, affecting its immune system (Odore et al., 2004; Fike and Spire, 2006) and increasing the susceptibility to enteric and respiratory problems (Fike and Spire, 2006; Svensson et al., 2006a), which are the principal causes of high morbidity and mortality during the preweaned period (NAHMS, 2010).",

Previous research with calves (Arthington et al., 2000b; Quigley et al., 2002) suggested that serum protein products improve health and decrease morbidity and mortality (Quigley and Wolfe, 2003) while maintaining or increasing growth. In addition, studies in humans and other species have shown that fructooligosaccharides (FOS) stimulate growth of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, inhibit colonization by pathogens, and improve mineral absorption (Howard et al., 1995; Sabater-Molina et al., 2009; Grand et al., 2013). Based on these data, our prediction was that products containing serum proteins or serum proteins plus FOS, in addition to milk products (dried whey and dried whey protein concentrate), minerals, and vitamins, would improve performance, morbidity, and mortality of dairy calves subjected to the stressors of winter cold weather and transport, especially during their first 2 to 3 wk of life. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an arrival fluid support product containing serum proteins or an early life dietary supplement containing serum proteins and FOS among other ingredients on performance, morbidity, and mortality of stressed male calves.",

Serum from d 28 was analyzed for concentrations of urea N and total protein. Concentrations of albumin, urea N, and total protein were determined at the University of Illinois, College of Veterinary Medicine Clinical Pathology Laboratory using commercially available kits (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA). Concentration of IgG was determined by radial immunodiffusion (RID kit, VRMD Inc., Pullman, WA) by APC Inc. Acid-soluble protein, haptoglobin, cortisol, and Zn were analyzed at Texas Tech University. Haptoglobin and Zn were determined as described by Makimura and Suzuki (1982) and Ballou et al. (2011), respectively. Cortisol was quantified using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor, MI) as described by the manufacturer (http://www.arborassays.com/documentation/inserts/K003-H.pdf). Acid-soluble protein was determined as follows. Serum samples (50 \u00b5L) were incubated with 1 mL of perchloric acid solution (66 mL of 0.6 M perchloric acid diluted in 1 L of distilled water) for 20 min at room temperature.

The model contained the fixed effects of AFS (E or AF), SUP (NG or G), the interaction of AFS and SUP, time (day or week), and interactions of time with treatments. Replicate and calf were considered random effects; calf was nested within replicate, AFS, and SUP. Time (day or week) was specified as the repeated factor with calf nested within replicate, AFS, and SUP as subject. Calf was the experimental unit. The covariance structures considered for repeated measures analysis were compound symmetric, autoregressive order one, and unstructured. The covariance structure that yielded the lowest Akaike information criterion-corrected value was autoregressive order one, and therefore it was used in the models (Littell et al., 1998). Initial measurements (before treatment administration) of BW, withers height, body length, heart girth, hip height, hip width, and concentrations of plasma albumin, ASP, cortisol, haptoglobin, and Zn at d 0 were used as covariates when analyzing the respective data. Least squares means were calculated and are presented with respective standard error of the mean.

Whereas some of the differences in mortality and morbidity may have resulted from the random assignment of calves with slightly better IgG status at arrival, apparent effects of G supplementation are consistent with previous research. Arthington et al. (2000a) reported fewer treatments for illness when calves were fed bovine serum as an IgG source at birth and 12 h later. Lower mortality and improved indices of enteric health (improved fecal scores, fewer days with diarrhea, and lower use of electrolytes) were reported by Quigley et al.

Fructooligosaccharides may increase the growth and population of beneficial intestinal microorganisms, thereby improving intestinal health and decreasing incidence or severity of diseases (Grizard and Barthomeuf, 1999; Menne et al., 2000). Because the commercial products tested in our study contained several ingredients that differed from the control treatments, it is not possible to discern whether serum proteins exerted the predominant effects or if the FOS and other ingredients worked additively or synergistically with the serum proteins.

Similar results have been described in other species; Pierce et al. (2005) reported enhanced feed intakes when spray-dried plasma was fed to early weaned pigs. Supplementation with serum protein and greater intakes of DM and CP during the first 2 wk improved BW, ADG, and feed efficiency during early serum protein supplementation.

These tendencies may be related to the stimulation of starter intake during the first 2 wk. Greater early starter intake in stressed calves would be a benefit in terms of growth and resistance to disease. The improved early growth is in agreement with Jones et al. (2004), who fed a colostrum replacement derived from bovine serum at 1.5 and 13.5 h of age.\n",

(1970) and Willett and Erb (1972), respectively. Thus, these increases in our study were small and likely cannot be considered biologically elevated. Increases may be related to the greater protein intake during the first AFS feeding. Together, these results provide no evidence of difference in inflammation or acute phase response between calves supplemented with serum proteins and those not supplemented.",

The AF, which contained serum proteins in addition to additional milk solids, minerals, and vitamins, promoted starter intake, growth, and improved fecal score during the first 2 wk. Similarly, G supplementation increased early nutrient intake and stimulated early growth, decreased incidence of respiratory problems at 2 wk, and significantly decreased mortality. Whether these effects may be the result of serum proteins, FOS, and other ingredients working additively or synergistically cannot be discerned in the present study. Indicators of acute-phase response were not affected by AF versus E or G versus NG. Because serum IgG status was somewhat better by random chance in calves assigned to receive G than in calves that were not supplemented, decreases in mortality and morbidity in G-supplemented calves should be confirmed in studies with larger numbers of at-risk calves.",
