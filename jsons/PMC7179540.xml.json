The epidemic expanded rapidly to 26 regions and countries [2, 3, 4], and by the end of July 2003, 8,098 probable cases had been reported and more than 774 people had died [5]. Although the epidemic seemed to be controlled during the summer of 2003, laboratory-associated infections appeared in Singapore in September 2003, in Taiwan in December 2003 and in Beijing in April 2004. At the end of 2003, a new series of probable SARS cases, which may have been unrelated to laboratory sources of infection, re-emerged in Gangdong. Therefore, it must be considered possible that SARS outbreaks could start at any time, anywhere in the world.",

The virus seems to be susceptible to inactivation by heating and exposure to organic chemicals that disrupt the virus envelope, such as acetone and ethanol, as well as fixatives such as formalin. However, additional information on inactivation of SARS-CoV is imperative for the establishment of effective infection control protocols in a variety of settings. As several SARS outbreaks may have originated from laboratories, the guidelines for handling the virus in the laboratory must be established according to accurate information on the stability of SARS-CoV.",

The results clearly indicate that all the PVP-I products tested have strong virucidal activities against SARS-CoV. Because SARS-CoV is believed to be transmitted mainly through the airborne route [13], PVP-I products for gargling and spraying the throat may have a prophylactic effect on SARS during outbreaks.
