Un-related transplants are further complicated by the paucity of air flights. In HCT units, COVID-19 illness in staff may deplete health care worker numbers. At the time of writing only one HCT recipient contracted COVID-19 infection in Ireland and happily made a full recovery (personal communication Dr E Conneally, National Stem Cell Transplant, Unit, St James\u2019 Hospital, Dublin). At the moment there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 infection but there are numerous drug trials taking place. Ultimately a vaccine is eagerly awaited.",

Although wine sales have increased from off-licences (it\u2019s one way of passing the time) in many countries, there are specific and sometimes unexpected problems. Grape picking is obviously a seasonal issue Fig. 1 and, in many continents, the harvest depends on migrant/seasonal workers. In many European countries and in the United States migrant workers are essential as native populations do not want to partake in what is described as poorly paid and back-breaking work. The grape picking season will not begin until late August/September so it\u2019s a little early to predict the extent of possible difficulties.",

However, many fruit crops require pollination and the relative absence of bees poses problems. According to Laura Battle writing in the weekend FT [8] the global spread of coronavirus has had an enormous impact on consumers and farmers. As with grapes many farmers rely on seasonal/migrant fruit pickers. She says that one of Britain\u2019s largest suppliers chartered a flight from Romania for 150 seasonal pickers. In Ireland a large supplier chartered a plane and brought 189 fruit pickers from Bulgaria. Everybody understands the need to pick fruit when it is ripe, but adequate quarantine and living accommodation must be provided. I have not personally examined the living conditions of seasonal workers but would be surprised if they are pristine and social distancing possible. A representative of a large fruit supplier in Ireland claimed that it takes 6 months to train a fruit-picker. If we can train medical students to become doctors in 4-5 years this seems unlikely to me. Another side of the coin is that many seasonal workers play a very important role in the economy of their country of origin by sending money home like thousands of Italians and Irish did in the early 20th century.",
