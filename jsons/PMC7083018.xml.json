Type I IFNs are induced by the recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and act by inducing interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that collectively contribute to an antiviral response (4, 5). All type I IFNs bind to and signal through the same heterodimeric receptor complex IFNAR1/2, but both evolutionary analyses and functional studies suggest that multiple IFN subtypes make non-redundant contributions to immunity (6\u201310). Although the exact functional contribution for each IFN is not completely understood, differences in the interaction of various IFN subtypes with IFNAR1/2 are known to differentially induce downstream ISGs (10\u201312). As a result, differences in pathogen-specific antiviral effect are possible, depending on the amount and profile of ISGs induced by a particular IFN.",

Whereas, humans have a single IFNW gene, almost half of the Egyptian rousette IFN genes belong to the IFN-\u03c9 subtype. The functional relevance of the expansion is not known. In humans and other species, IFN-\u03c9 is induced by viral infection and has potent antiviral activity against various RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and influenza A virus (20\u201324). Multiple subtypes of porcine IFN-\u03c9 are expressed after viral infection and have dramatic differences in activity despite very few single nucleotide polymorphisms (23). The ISGs induced specifically by these IFN-\u03c9 proteins, however, are not known. To begin to understand the role of these genes in the immune response to viruses in bats, we synthesized and purified recombinant Egyptian rousette IFN-\u03c9 proteins. We characterized the antiviral potency and efficacy of these recombinant proteins against VSV and against MARV, and examined the downstream ISGs they induce.",

The IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 binding sites in all human type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03c9, have been well-characterized (12). We annotated the broad collection of residues that participate in receptor binding on all 22 proteins using the NCBI conserved domain database search. While proteins within a clade have high identity at these receptor-binding sites, these sites are much less conserved between clades (Table 1).",

Crystal structure analysis of two human type I IFNs bound to their receptor has led to a model that connects differences in receptor recognition and conformation to differences in downstream signaling (12). According to this model, ligand residues that interact with the receptor are classified into three groups. First, there are conserved \u201canchor\u201d residues\u2014those that are identical among all or most human IFN subtypes. Second, there are conserved \u201cmodulating\u201d residues that are identical among all or most human IFN subtypes but when mutated, change the energetics of the ligand-receptor interaction and lead to functional changes. Third, there are \u201cligand-specific\u201d residues that vary greatly among human IFN subtypes (12). We examined several rousette IFN-\u03c9 subtypes using this classification and compared residues that were identified as functionally important. The \u201canchor,\u201d \u201cmodulating,\u201d and \u201cligand-specific\u201d residues are overall fairly conserved between the human and at least one of the bat IFN-\u03c9 proteins (Figure 1B). However, when comparing the bat proteins, there is noticeable diversity among the \u201cligand-specific\u201d residues. Additionally, by definition, conservation of the \u201cmodulating\u201d residues does not guarantee an energetically equal reaction with the receptor subunits. Together, this suggests that the five rousette IFN-\u03c9 groups are likely to react with the receptor with different kinetics and affinities, potentially resulting in different downstream effects.",

We first compared the effect of treatment on mean expression of each gene via an ANOVA-like test for differential expression. For each gene rejecting the null in the ANOVA analysis (ANOVA FDR < 0.05) (Figure 3A), every IFN treatment condition was contrasted with the appropriate control treatment; rIFN-\u03c9-treated samples were compared to rD1-treated samples at the same concentration and time point.

We cross-referenced the remaining genes with data from (1) the Interferome\u2014a database of ISGs from a wide variety of human and mouse studies (27); (2) data from a recent analysis of the IFN response in ten different species (25); and (3) ImmGen\u2014a database of ISGs from a variety of human immune cells (26).

In contrast, of the 358 genes upregulated by either IFN-\u03c9 at any time point or concentration, 87.4% (313 genes) were found in at least one database, and 12.6% (52 genes) were not. These percentages are slightly lower than those found in similar studies with UIFN and recombinant IFN-\u03b13 in the black flying fox (14, 17).

Humans have two functional Mx genes and seven functional genes each in the GIMAP and GBP subfamilies. GVIN1 is an interferon-inducible gene in other species but is only a pseudogene in the human genome. IFN-\u03c94 or -\u03c99 treatment of RoNi/7.1 cells led to the induction of nine different GIMAPs, five GBPs, and three GVIN genes (Figure 4C and Table S1). In contrast, UIFN induced only three interferon-inducible GTPases other than Mx genes suggesting that IFN-\u03c9s may be able to induce a more diverse ISG response by tapping into expanded families of GTPase-related genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, the bat IFN-\u03c9s induced all but one of the ISGs that were induced by UIFN, as well as additional ISGs that were not induced by UIFN (Figure 5). Fifty four genes were expressed only with IFN-\u03c99 treatment, while five were induced only with IFN-\u03c94 treatment.

Based on previous observations of the large expansion in the type I IFN-\u03c9 subfamily in the Egyptian rousette (19), we sought to examine members of this family to gain insight into the contributions of these proteins to Egyptian rousette antiviral immunity and to ask whether the considerable duplications in the IFN locus may have functional relevance for antiviral responses. In species with multiple IFN-\u03c9 genes, like Sus scrofa (pig) and Bos taurus (cow), differences in induction and antiviral potency among IFN-\u03c9 paralogs have been observed (23, 35\u201337). Consistent with this work, we found functional differences between two rousette IFN-\u03c9 subtypes, supporting the hypothesis that the IFN-\u03c9 subtypes are not interchangeable.",

However, several members of the GBP family in humans and/or mice have been shown to have antiviral activity against VSV, influenza A virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and retroviruses, including HIV-1 (40\u201342). GBPs are recruited to pathogen-containing compartments, including viral replication sites, by autophagy related proteins (43). Once recruited, they exert a variety of antiviral activities that interfere with various steps of the viral replication cycle within these compartments, coordinate lysis or lysosomal fusion, and activate the inflammasome (44, 45). For example, GBP1 inhibits the delivery of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus virions to the nucleus by interfering with actin filament organization (46). This blocking mechanism could be significant for MARV infection, given that MARV also relies on actin filaments to transport nucleocapsids to the budding sites (47). Given their close association with autophagy related proteins, GBPs can direct autophagy for pathogen clearance (45), which has recently been shown to be one mechanism by which bats can limit viral infection (48).",

In addition to these varied functions, GBPs play a role in inflammasome activation, either by helping to create PAMPs by lysing pathogen-containing compartments or by promoting caspase-11 activation or both (40). Fewer inflammasome-related genes and a diminished NLRP3-related inflammasome response have been observed in bats compared to other mammals (51, 52); whether the expression of multiple GBPs could compensate for this diminished response with less inflammation remains to be explored.",

GIMAPs are also expressed in black flying fox cells after UIFN or bat IFN-\u03b1 stimulation (14, 17), although not as many individual GIMAP genes were observed to be upregulated in these studies.

Kuzmin et al. have previously shown that two Egyptian rousette cell lines transfected with either Egyptian rousette IFN-\u03b2 or a consensus IFN-\u03b1 are able to resist both EBOV and MARV infection (59), but whether filovirus infection itself induces IFNs in bat cells is unclear. In general, MARV infection seems to suppress immune gene expression in immortalized Egyptian rousette cells, yet there are conflicting studies regarding the extent of this suppression. The EBOV antiviral protein VP35 is known to efficiently inhibit IFN induction in vitro in human cells; in contrast, MARV VP35 is a much weaker inhibitor, and MARV infection of human THP-1 cells does lead to an IFN response (60, 61). Infection of RoNi/7.1 cells with a MARV isolate from a wild-caught bat did not lead to any IFN induction at 3, 8, or 24 h after infection, and in fact, led to very little antiviral gene expression whatsoever (29). A MARV mutant with an impaired VP35 IFN-inhibiting domain only induced IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. In contrast, in the same study, Sendai virus induced multiple IFNs, including low levels of IFN-\u03c9s. MARV infection of R06E-J cells (an Egyptian rousette embryonic cell line) led to modest induction of a few ISGs and no detectable IFN induction (62). However, a MARV isolate from a patient in Uganda did lead to significant ISG expression in RoNi/7.1 cells, though IFN-\u03c9 genes were not examined (59). These differences may be attributable to different viral strains, cell lines, and time points. Of note, all these studies were performed with immortalized cells. Even if MARV infection of these cell lines does not lead to IFN-\u03c9 induction, it is still possible that various primary cell types could serve as a source of IFN-\u03c9 in vivo. It has recently been shown that Egyptian rousette dendritic cells that are infected with a bat isolate of MARV upregulate IFNs and ISGs, though the few IFN\u03c9 genes included in the Nanostring-based study were not reported to be significantly upregulated (63).",

Briefly, mRNA was purified by polyA capture and fragmented to an average length of ~410 bases. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher #18064014), followed by second strand synthesis and cleanup with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter #A63880). The resulting double-stranded cDNA was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until 3\u2032 adenylation and end repair the following day. Samples were barcoded with adapters from the TruSeq RNA CD Index Plate (Illumina), cleaned with AMPure XP beads, and libraries were enriched by PCR for 12 cycles. Final libraries were washed twice with AMPureXP beads (final bead wash ratio: 0.85x to remove adapter dimers), and quantified by Qubit 3.0 assay. A subset of samples was examined by DNA Bioanalyzer (Agilent) for quality purposes before pooling samples within each of three replicates. Pooled libraries were sent to Tufts Genomics Center for size selection (pippin size selection, 180\u20131,100 bp) and sequencing. Each library was sequenced on a separate lane of an eight-lane flow cell in high output mode on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using single-end 100 bp chemistry.",
