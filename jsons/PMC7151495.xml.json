Recent compassionate clinical trials of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as well as Remdesivir (see below) have been conducted, and await publication in scientific journals. The rapid global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 outlines the importance of and immediate need for antivirals. Potential broad-spectrum targets include viral gene products that are widely conserved and do not exist in the host cell, or that are structurally and functionally different enough from cellular homologous to achieve selective inhibition. For RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) presents an optimal target due to its crucial role in RNA synthesis, lack of host homolog and high sequence and structural conservation. The RdRp remains the target of choice for the treatment of several viral diseases, including chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus infection. Arguably the most promising, broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Upon delivery into the host cell, nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs are metabolized into an active 5'-triphosphate form (5'-TP) which competes with endogenous nucleotides as substrates for the viral RdRp. The NAs are subsequently incorporated into the nascent viral RNA by the RdRp, accounting for the antiviral effect through several mechanisms of action (MoA).",

Sofosbuvir is a pro-drug of 2'F-2'C-ME-UMP that has a 3'-OH but acts as a chain-terminator nonetheless4. In combination with other drugs, Sofosbuvir is widely and successfully used to cure HCV infections, but no data are available regarding activity against coronaviruses.",

The CoV ExoN interacts with the very processive trimeric RNA polymerase complex consisting of the viral RdRp (nsp12) and associated cofactors (nsp7 and nsp8) to perform proofreading activity8\n,\n15. This mechanism was demonstrated for Rbv-TP, which is readily incorporated as a purine nucleotide in biochemical assays. However, 3'-terminal Rbv-MP is readily excised from RNA by the SARS-CoV ExoN, a removal that is thought to jeopardize NA potency against CoVs8\n,\n16.

            "text": "Despite this, NAs remain a good option for the treatment of CoV infections based on the high level of structural conservation of the viral RdRps, particularly regarding nucleotide binding sites. Additionally, NAs display a relatively high barrier to resistance relative to other antivirals, as escape mutations likely come at a high cost to viral replication. In support of this, the broad-spectrum AMP analogue Remdesivir (GS-5734) which is currently used for the treatment of several diverse viral infections has shown promising results, inhibiting viral replication of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in various in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cultures, and reducing disease severity in a mouse model20\n,\n21. Recently, Remdesivir was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture, supporting the potential of this NA produg to be used for the broad-spectrum treatment of CoV infections22. Importantly, passaging of the model \u03b2-CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in the presence of the parent nucleoside GS-441524 yielded two resistance mutations in the viral RdRp (F476L and V553L), which were also shown to confer resistance in SARS-CoV (F480L and V557L in SARS-CoV)21. However, resistance came at a cost to viral replication in vitro, and furthermore attenuated SARS-CoV in vivo. As is the case for Rbv-TP, the ExoN of CoV may be able to excise incorporated GS 441524-MP, as shown by the increased potency against ExoN deficient viruses21. This raises interesting questions as to the balance between incorporation of NA-TPs by the RdRp and removal by the ExoN of the NA-MPs, whereby the NA-TPs must be incorporated by the polymerase faster than the excision rate of the ExoN.",

Likewise, using the crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 Exo as well as structural alignment with other homologous DE(D/E)Eh ExoN enzymes, such as that of the N protein of Lassa virus24, we map the contacts of the RNA terminated with GS-441524-MP at the 3'-end with the SARS-CoV ExoN active site. Coupling NAs with ExoN inhibitors may be an attractive option, and may further reduce viral escape potential.",

Alignment of nsp12 for the whole CoV family indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 is almost identical to that of the SARS-CoV (96% identity 98% similarity): a total of 31 amino acid (aa) changes are present along the protein of 804 amino acids (Fig. 1\nA). Of these, twenty two map to the nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN)25; a large domain located N-terminal of the RdRp core that does not appear to play a structural nor functional role in polymerase activity (Shannon & Canard, unpublished).. While the NiRAN is a genetic marker for the Nidovirales order for which no viral or cellular homologs have been identified, it characteristically displays a low level of sequence conservation throughout the order. Furthermore, while a nucleotidylation activity has been defined for the small-genome arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV)25, the exact role of the NiRAN domain in the Nidovirus viral life-cycle is unknown. The remaining nine mutations are located in the C-terminal RdRp domain of nsp12 (Fig 1A), and only one of them (S783A) is a non-conservative mutation.",

Using the SARS-CoV nsp12 cryo-EM structure (PDB 6NUR), we built a model by stacking nsp12 onto a set of related RdRps described by Peersen27 and used the T7 RNA polymerase ternary complex28 to position both RNA and the incoming NTP. RNA and ATP were subsequently modelled at the SARS-CoV nsp12 active site. Overall, the structure is similar to that of the poliovirus polymerase: Motifs A-G encircle and constitute the polymerase active site, with an open NTP entry tunnel leading to the catalytic center (Fig. 2\nA). In CoV nsp12, motifs A,B,C,D and F the most conserved, and this conservation extends to Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae families29: it is thus reasonable to extrapolate that the mechanism of action is similar to that of other viral RdRps, and in particular to Picornaviridae with which CoVs share the \"small thumb\" feature27. The ribose moiety of the NTP poised to be incorporated is properly positioned by a conserved serine located in motif B and probably by residues of motif F (Fig. 2B, light blue and purple, see below).",

The structure of motif B is considered loose, but its conformational change upon binding the NTP is considered as a fidelity check point of viral RdRps33.

Delayed chain termination mediated by GS 441524-MP has been demonstrated for Respiratory Syncitial virus34, Nipah virus35 and Ebola virus36 RdRps, and more relevant to this discussion for the MERS-CoV RdRp complex36. Likewise, the action of the ExoN remains to be determined once GS 441524-MP has been incorporated and buried in the nascent RNA chain.

When this model is built with GS 441524-TP, it shows that the cyano group at the 1'-ribose position of GS 441524-TP would fit easily (Fig. 5B). However, no proper positioning of the pseudo-adenine can be easily achieved. Superimposition of the ribose so as to position the metal ions for proper catalysis implicates a potential steric clash of the GS 441524 pseudo-adenine with surrounding nucleotides (Fig. 5C). In other words, if the pseudo-adenine base-pairs properly, the \u03b1-phosphate would be pushed away and unaligned for catalysis with the metal ions. It is thus likely that excision of GS 441524-MP is significantly less efficient than that of a regular nucleotide. Alternately, the GS 441524-MP might remain stuck in the polymerase active site as described above for delayed chain termination, and be inaccessible for excision.",

As shown in Figure 5 the replacement of a standard nucleotide by GS-441524 generate a structural distortion and a clash between its non-planar nucleobase part and the template base. To accommodate this structurally, the ribose would have to move away from its canonical position and towards the catalytic ions. Due to the small size of the catalytic cavity, this would generate in turn a displacement on the catalytic ions from the active site, as shown for a similar two-metal ion catalysis ExoN reaction where any slight modification in ion position or distortion leads to inhibition of the reaction40. Better structurally defined nsp14:RNA complexes are needed to fully understand the structural requirements of 3'-terminal nucleotides for ExoN-mediated removal. Of note, the engineered MHV V553I RdRp mutant was found to be inextricably linked with ExoN activity, i.e. the fidelity effect could only be detected in ExoN deficient virus23. Importantly, as is the case for Rbv, the ExoN of CoV may be able to recognise and excise incorporated GS 441524-MP, as shown by the increased potency against ExoN deficient viruses21. However, unlike other Rbv and 5-FU, Remdesivir is active on WT, and ExoN(-) mutants show only modest 4.5 fold increase in sensitivity to Remdesivir, indicating that inhibition likely originates by a mixed effect balanced between incorporation and excision.",

Red star marked the mutation between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. The NiRAN and the polymerase domains are separated by a dashed line. The polymerase conserved motifs (A-G) are shown under the consensus sequence. Alignments were made using Seaview41 and Espript42(B) Cartoon representation of nsp12 SARS-CoV (PDB: 6NUR). The motifs are colored as follows: A, yellow; B, cyan; C, orange; D, forest green; E, blue; F, pink; G, light green. Around the structure are WebLogo43 highlighting the A-G motifs.
