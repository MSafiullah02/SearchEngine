We hoped the PacBio long-read technology 84 would facilitate accuracy in annotating this evolutionary divergent species. E. spelaea is 85 a specialist nectar-feeding bat that feeds predominantly on nectar and pollen, and is 86 widely distributed over both the tropics and subtropics, throughout the Indomalayan 87 region [15] [16] [17] . This species has been associated with pollination of durians and other 88 (Table 1 ). This translated into 105 an ~80x coverage for the target genome (~2 Gb in length: estimates based on the 106 average size of all previously sequenced 14 bat genomes, Figure S1 ). The ~80x 107 coverage is above the minimum 50-60x coverage reported for self-correction of the 108 high-error PacBio reads compared to Illumina reads [27] . For isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq), 357,722 (~1 Gb in total length) raw sub-reads 110 (read length mean \u00b1 SD, 2,934 \u00b1 1,775) were obtained (Table 1), representing an  111   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62 (Table 2) .

The 273 pre-assembly module is a built-in module in Falcon for error-correcting PacBio sub-274 reads. A total of 15,470,844 preads were generated (read length mean \u00b1 SD, 7,034 \u00b1 275 5,874) from the PacBio sub-reads. Preads over 10 kb were used (length-cutoff-pr) to 276 seed pre-assembly. Daligner was used to detect all pairwise local overlapping region 277 between sub-reads and also between corrected preads. Overlapping options were set 278",

The 145 relatively higher number of protein coding genes predicted in E. spelaea compared to P. 146 alecto and R. aegyptiacus is likely due to a more homologous approach being used to 147 predict the gene models of E. spelaea than that of P. alecto and R. aegyptiacus (see 148 Method).

Our results provide the first comprehensive overview of splice variants in 204 any bat species using a direct sequencing analysis approach rather than in silico 205 analysis. 206 207Conclusion and Discussion 208In this study, we provided the first assembly of a bat genome solely using the PacBio \u00ae 209 long-read sequencing technology. The E. spelaea genome assembly exemplifies the 210 power of long-read sequencing technologies in rapid de novo assembly of a non-model 211 genome and alternative-splicing isoform identification. Compared to the hybrid 212 assembled R. aegyptiacus genome, the \"PacBio-only\" assembly was faster, more 213 straightforward and possessed higher contiguous N50 contigs and better repeat-214 resolving with a minimum difference (0.7%) in gene integrity. Thus, our study provides a 215 high-quality reference genome for use in any future comparative studies. Even without 216 scaffolding, these highly contiguous contigs and FL gene transcripts will be helpful to 217 researchers to extract more accurate genomic loci information of their genes of interest, 218 saving a great amount of energy, resources and time. Our Iso-Seq results have 219 increased our understanding of the complexity of the bat transcriptome and aided in 220 alternative transcript identification. This complexity in the transcriptome of bats is still 221 likely to be underestimated since Iso-Seq was performed at a relatively shallow depth 222 (~20x coverage) in this study. We would like to further highlight that this complexity is 223 attributed by the type and number of alternative transcription events, as well as 224 previously unannotated transcripts in bats.

More recently, bats have been increasingly recognized as an important reservoir 56 harboring numerous pathogenic viruses while displaying minimal clinical signs of 57 disease [3]. Indeed, comparing the genomes of bats with other mammalian species has 58 revealed an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes. These include those 59 involved in DNA damage repair and innate immune functions, which may partially 60 explain bats' unique tolerance to deadly viruses and their unusually long lifespan [4]. 61 Together, this highlights bats as an emerging model organism in the study of ecology, 62 development, aging and evolution. 63 Accurate assembly and annotation of genomes is a critical first step for further 64 functional studies of genetic variation.
