On the other side of the coin, we have seen that the lack of familiarity with SS has led physicians to attribute other concurrent diseases (such as herpetic keratitis, heart attack, stroke, and septic or crystalline arthropathies) to their SS and thus not initiate appropriate care of the immediate problem.",

Women with SS may develop dysuria, urinary frequency, nocturia, and urgency-symptoms that are thought, in the absence of infection, to be due to interstitial cystitis. The frequency with which this symptom complex occurs was evaluated in a study of 870 Finnish women with SS and 1,304 population controls [158] .

Thus, later onset of NSIP should suggest other etiologies including infection including tuberculosis, lymphoma, or drug toxicity [178] [179] [180] [181] . Acute respiratory failure in SS patients may be the presenting manifestation of hypokalemic paralysis [182, 183] . Atopic dermatitis may be more common in SS patients, due to the added component of autoimmune anhidrosis [184] . An association of IgA anti-CCP antibodies (circular citrullinated peptide) was found with cutaneous vasculitis [185] . In patients with livedo reticularis, a relatively high incidence of anti-cardiolipin and anti-\u03b22-glycoproteins was reported; surprisingly, there was relative overlap between subsets of patients with each autoantibody [186] . The sensation of nasal \"congestion\" in SS patients is common. This finding is frequently out of proportion to the observed patency of the airways and probably reflects the influence of neural sensory circuits that have dysfunction analogous to those innervating the eye and mouth [187] .
