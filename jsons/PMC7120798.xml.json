In one study, influenza occurred in almost 3% of travellers. It should be remembered that, while specific influenza seasons occur in the northern (November\u2013March) and southern hemispheres (April\u2013September), influenza is a year-round disease in the tropics. Seasonal influenza can be imported \u2018out-of-season\u2019 by travellers, and travel is expected to be an important aspect of spread should an influenza pandemic or avian influenza outbreak occur. Consequently, returned travellers who are unwell with suspected influenza should be isolated, and, if admitted to hospital, careful contact and respiratory precautions should be upheld.",
