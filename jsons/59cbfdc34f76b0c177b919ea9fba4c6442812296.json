The current global threat related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social isolation. How does this situation affect dreams? Is dreaming during the pandemic related to mental suffering? Does the act of observing dreams help to mitigate mental suffering? To address these questions, we applied natural language processing tools to study 210 dream reports (n=67, Pandemic group n=42, plus control group balanced for age, sex and education) either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during March-April, 2020, following the pandemic announcement by the WHO and quarantine was imposed in Brazil. Postannouncement dreams showed a higher proportion of words related to anger and sadness, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms \"contamination\" and \"cleanness\", which tended to increase over time. These features were associated with mental suffering related to social isolation, as they explained 39% of the variance in PANSS negative subscale (p=0.0092).",

One issue in such debate is how episodic memories (memories of lived experiences) are manifested during dreaming [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . A related question is whether threatening events -such as the pandemic spread of a virus -can influence people's dreaming patterns. For individual trauma, the role of dreaming is already recognized, and recurrent dreams depicting threatening situations are an important sign in the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, the scenario is far less clear when it comes to collective trauma, such as the one we have been experiencing with COVID-19.",

Although it seems to be irrefutable today that the waking life is part of dreaming, recent studies have shown that only isolated spatial and temporal fragments of episodic memory are present in dreams 3, 10, 11 . However, when traumatic experiences are at stake, dream imagery can get highly episodic. One explanation for that is that when something out of the ordinary happenslike a pandemicour brains may process the experience through dreaming. Episodic fragments (such as characters and settings), as well as semantic information, are brought together over time, maintaining a sense of firstperson and continuous present perspective.",

According to the authors, dreams are thought to be the brain's way of working out our emotional problems, and the more anxious we become in waking life, the more vivid our dream images seem to become. Barrett et al. examined the dream contents produced by British officers held in a Nazi camp for prisoners of war (POW) between 1940-1942 13 . These POW dreams showed more content concerning battles, imprisonment, escape, and food than the male norms from the same era. Not much of any type of social interaction was detected in the POW dream reports, with less friendliness, sexuality, and even less aggression than the male norms. However, aggression was unusually extreme when it occurred, and its content was linked to previous battles rather than .

One caveat is that most data about dreams collected during confinement or obtained from former war combatants have been gathered only after the person is away from the arena of combat 12 . Studies of dream reports during extended confinement, like the present one, are scarce and called for.",

Blagrove and collaborators proposed that dreams sharing has an empathic effect on the dreamer and on significant others engaged in a dream telling situation 29 . Trait empathy was found to be significantly associated with the frequency of listening to the dreams of others, frequency of telling one's dreams to others, and attitude toward dreams. Moreover, the dream-discusser state of empathy towards the dreamsharer was found to increase significantly as a result of the dream discussion, with medium effect size, whereas the dream-sharer presented a small decrease in empathy towards the dreamdiscusser. Based on these results, the authors suggest that dreams act as a piece of fiction that can be explored by the dreamer together with other people, inducing, thus, empathy about the life circumstances of the dreamer. They also speculate that the story-like characteristics of adult human dreams may have been positively selected during human evolution as part of the selection for emotional intelligence, empathy, and social bonding.",

As eleven of them reported continuous use of psychotropic medication and mental health diagnosis, we analyzed their data separately ( Figure 1B) . Then we constituted a control group of 31 participants pared to the 31 participants free from mental health diagnosis ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ). All the control participants were also free from mental health symptoms, diagnosis, or psychotropic medication. They used the same method to collect dream reports remotely before the existence of the COVID-19 virus (using a customized smartphone application designed for access to memory oral reports to track for mental health suffering signs). Six of the 31 participants of the control group could also participate in this pandemic period of data collection ( Figure 1B) , and these 6 paired examples of changes in dream reports are shown in Figure 1C .",

In sequence, the application requested a report from the previous day and prompted 3 images to then request to tell a story based on that picture.

At each step, a neural network is trained to predict the central word from the context, that is, from the other words in the window. Once the neural network is trained, a vector representation for each word in the corpus is extracted from the input and output layers of the model, which is used as the word embedding. The original text files were transformed to lowercase, word-tokenized, and cleared from non-alphabetic tokens and stop-words (using nltk Portuguese stop-word list 38 ). Then, for each text file, we calculated the semantic similarity of each word to the probe words by calculating the cosine between the word and the probe word. To control for the possible difference in word count and also to refine the results for only the most related words to the probe terms, we considered to the final average similarity only those words that reached the threshold of 0.3 (the maximum similarity is 1).
