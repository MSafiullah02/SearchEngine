One potential source of an emerging pathogen is a different host species (a \u2018reservoir\u2019) in which the pathogen is already established (Table 1\n). Switches from one host species to another (species \u2018jumps\u2019) have led to some of the most devastating disease epidemics recorded, including the ongoing HIV/AIDS pandemic in human communities worldwide, the decimation of the European rabbit population by myxomatosis during the mid 20th century, the catastrophic impact of rinderpest on African ruminants during the late 19th century and, more recently, widespread mortality of North Sea seals as a result of distemper 2, 3, 4, 5. It has even been argued that many of the main killer diseases of humans (e.g. measles, TB, influenza and smallpox) emerged through pathogens jumping from domestic animals to humans over the past 10 000 years [6]. Species jumps have also given rise to devastating epidemics of plant pathogens in crop species (e.g. potato late blight in the cultivated potato) and in wild plant species (e.g. the near extinction of American chestnut trees by chestnut blight) 7, 8, 9.",

            "text": "Epidemiological theory has a well developed conceptual framework for evaluating the spread of infection through a host population (Box 1). The expected size of an outbreak depends upon the number of introductions, so-called \u2018primary\u2019 cases of infection, and the potential for transmission of the pathogen from one new host to another (Box 1, Figure Ia). This transmission potential can be expressed in terms of the basic reproduction number, R\n0, and pathogens that enter a new host population via a species jump can be placed in two categories depending on its value. If R\n0 is <1 in the new host population then, even if the new host repeatedly acquires the pathogen, there will be only limited spread of infection within that population. This category of emerging pathogen is unlikely to constitute the greatest disease threat; examples in humans include the Ebola, monkeypox and avian influenza viruses and the vCJD agent. Conversely, if R\n0 is >1 in the new host population, then there is a finite chance (Box 1, Figure Ib) that a major epidemic will occur. This category is likely to constitute the greatest disease threat; examples in humans include HIV, influenza type A virus and SARS coronavirus.Box 1Epidemic thresholds and R0, the basic reproduction numberThe basic reproduction number, R\n0, is the average number of secondary cases of infection generated by a single primary case introduced into a large population of previously unexposed hosts [5]. R\n0 is related to the transmissibility of the pathogen (new infections per unit time) and the duration of infectiousness. It is sometimes referred to as a measure of transmission potential (with analogies to r\nmax as used in simple ecological theory) because it refers to the situation where there are no density-dependent constraints on the spread of infection. R\n0 defines an important threshold: if R\n0>1, each primary infection will, on average, generate more than one secondary infection and the pathogen is capable of invading the host population; if R\n0<1, each primary case will, on average, fail to replace itself (although short chains of transmission are still possible) and each single introduction will lead to no more than a minor outbreak.The expected final size of an outbreak of an infectious disease, I\nfinal can be related to R\n0 and I\n0, the number of primary cases of infection, using a modified version of the Kermack\u2013McKendrick equation (Equation I, [26]):\n[Eqn I]Ifinal=N\u2212(N\u2212I0)exp[\u2212R0IfinalN]\nwhere N is the size of the susceptible population.The behaviour of this equation is illustrated in Figure I\na. For R\n0<1, the size of an outbreak is determined mainly by the number of primary cases, I\n0. For R\n0>1, the size of an outbreak is determined mainly by the size of the susceptible population, N. For R\n0 close to 1, the size of an outbreak is sensitive to the precise value of R\n0.Even for R\n0>1, a major epidemic is not inevitable: it is possible that the infection will die out without causing a major epidemic owing to demographic stochasticity. The probability of a major epidemic occurring can be related to R\n0 and I\n0 using Equation II\n[17]:\n[Eqn II]P(epidemic)=1\u2212(1R0)I0\nThe behaviour of this equation is illustrated in Figure Ib. For R\n0 values not much above 1, there is a high probability that a major epidemic will not occur unless there are many primary cases. Even for larger R\n0 values, there is a good chance that an epidemic will not occur if there are only a few primary cases.The probability that, following a single cross-species transmission event by a pathogen with R\n0<1in the new host, the pathogen adapts to its new host during an outbreak is approximated by Equation III\n[19]:\n[Eqn III]P(adaptation)\u2248\u03bcR01\u2212R0\nwhere \u03bc is the (small) probability that the required genetic change occurs during a single infection. The behaviour of this equation is illustrated in Figure Ic. If the new R\n0 is >1, then the evolved pathogen will give rise to a major epidemic with the probability given by Equation II.",

There is a transition between these behaviours in the region R\n0\u22481, where the size of an epidemic is highly sensitive to small changes in the transmission potential (Box 1, Figure Ia). This is especially relevant to pathogen emergence because it implies that relatively small changes in R\n0 can have large impacts on the incidence of infection. As has been widely discussed, there are many reasons why R\n0 might change. These include:",

Pathogens have highly variable host ranges: some only naturally infect a single species (e.g. the mumps virus or Plasmodium falciparum in humans), whereas others can infect hosts from different taxonomic orders or even classes (e.g. rabies virus or the protozoan Blastocystis hominis) [26]. The reasons for this variation are poorly understood, although certain factors, such as an indirect route of transmission, are known to be associated with a broad host range [26]. For viruses, one such factor is the use of cell receptors that are phylogenetically conserved [23]. Crucial to the ability of a cell-free virus to infect hosts is the presence of appropriate cell receptors on host cells. When receptors are conserved across a range of potential host species, the hosts are likely to be predisposed to infection by the viruses using these receptors. For example, use of conserved receptors might explain the wide host ranges of foot-and-mouth diseases virus (FMDV), which uses the integrin vitronectin, and rabies virus, which uses the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor [27].",

It is relatively simple to see that the probability of emergence increases linearly with I\n0, but is much more sensitive to the evolution of R\n0, particularly when this is close to 1 [19]. This is because the probability of each (rare) evolutionary step is proportional to the expected size of the initial outbreak and, hence, the number of opportunities for the required genetic change(s) to occur (Box 1, Figure Ic). The expected size of an outbreak is related non-linearly to R\n0 (Box 1, Figure Ia) and, because conditions are likely to differ from outbreak to outbreak, outbreak sizes in practice tend to be highly overdispersed, with occasional larger outbreaks providing more opportunities for adaptation (Figure 2\n).",

            "text": "There are several additional issues that could also be analyzed using the above framework for assessing the likelihood of a successful invasion (many of which apply to biological invasions in general [39]). For example, fluctuating transmission rates can increase persistence times for pathogens with R\n0<1 [40]. It is also possible that, rather than single introduction(s) into a new host population, there are periods when the pathogen is spreading in a mixture of host species (e.g. as has been proposed for human sleeping sickness [41]); this could increase persistence times in the new host but, simultaneously, reduce selection pressure on the pathogen to adapt to the new host. And the new host population itself is unlikely to be homogeneous: some individuals might be more susceptible to novel pathogens (e.g. owing to immunosuppression) and/or more exposed to them (e.g. owing to their behaviour or spatial location [42]) and/or more likely to transmit infection (so-called \u2018supershedders\u2019). Such heterogeneities can increase outbreak sizes [5]. The structure of the new host population might also be important: contrast Ebola, which usually affects remote communities, with SARS, which arose in a region with high human population density, large numbers of movements and extensive travel. Similarly, the HIV/AIDS epidemic apparently took off once it had escaped remote communities and entered urban populations [17]. The general issue here is the relationship between \u2018samplers\u2019 (individuals with high risk of acquiring novel infections) and \u2018spreaders\u2019 (individuals with high potential for transmitting a novel infection onwards within the new host population): the closer the epidemiological linkage between these groups the greater the potential for successful invasions by new pathogens. The mechanism of genetic change of the pathogen is also likely to be important: if it can evolve not only by mutation, but also by recombination (e.g. influenza viruses and SARS coronavirus 32, 43) or by gene capture (e.g. pathogenicity islands or antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria 44, 45) or by hybridization (e.g. P. alni) then this might influence the epidemiology of species jumps by requiring the same host to be co-infected with two different pathogens, perhaps from different sources.",

Although it is extremely hard to predict which pathogens are most likely to jump between host species, there are some hints that some progress can be made. For example, perhaps the most striking feature of the list of examples of species jumps given in Table 1 is that the pathogens involved are mostly, and disproportionately, single-stranded RNA viruses. Although Table 1 should not be regarded as an exhaustive survey, this might well be a genuine effect reflecting the typically broader host ranges and much higher mutation rates of RNA viruses [26], facilitating both the initial infection of a new host and subsequence adaptation to that host. Further refining this observation, none of the RNA viruses listed are transmitted by arthropod vectors, perhaps reflecting the constraints imposed on a small genome by having to be compatible with a vector as well as a definitive host. In support of this, both emerging and long-recognised zoonotic RNA arboviruses tend to be poorly transmissible between humans 24, 25, although experimental evidence for such constraints is inconclusive [25].",
