Despite severe outbreaks and lack of antiviral drug, a mere progress has been made regarding to an epitope-based vaccine designed for CHIKV. In this study, we aimed to design an epitope-based vaccine that can trigger a significant immune response as well as to prognosticate inhibitor that can bind with potential drug target sites by using various immunoinformatics and docking simulation tools. Initially, whole proteome of CHIKV was retrieved from database and perused to identify the most immunogenic protein. Structural properties of the selected protein were analyzed. The capacity to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity by T cell and B cell were checked for the selected protein. The peptide region spanning 9 amino acids from 397 to 405 and the sequence YYYELYPTM were found as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. This peptide could interact with as many as 19 HLAs and showed high population coverage ranging from 69.50% to 84.94%. By using in silico docking techniques the epitope was further assessed for binding against HLA molecules to verify the binding cleft interaction. In addition with this, the allergenicity of the epitopes was also evaluated. In the post therapeutic strategy, three dimensional structure was predicted along with validation and verification that resulted in molecular docking study to identify the potential drug binding sites and suitable therapeutic inhibitor against targeted protein.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Finally, pharmacophore study was also performed in quest of seeing potent drug activity.

Upon entering the acidic environment of endosomes causes dissociation of trimeric spikes of E1-E2 heterodimers and reorganization into E1 homotrimers. These trimers with the help of hydrophobic fusion trimer (fusion loop) enter the host cell and undergo refolding to form a hairpin like structure. This interaction fuses the virus and host cell membrane and the viral nucleocapsid enters the host cell. This phenomenon is mediated by low pH along with cholesterol like all other alphaviruses and virus budding also requires presence of these mediators (Rashad et al., 2014) . Along with host cell proteins positive strand replicase produce 26S sub-genomic positive strand RNAs and 49S genomic RNAs (Barton et al., 1991; Shirako and Strauss, 1994) . The 26S RNAs encode the structural protein precursors which are cleaved by a serine protease to produce capsid (c), pE2, 6K and E1. The C protein is thought to induce the autocatalytic activity and contain conserved regions known to have the similar activity in other alphaviruses (Grakoui et al., 1989) . In addition to that a furin like protease activity cleaves the pE2 into E2 and E3 in the plasma membrane. Before that, pE2 and E1 undergoes post transcriptional modification in the golgi apparatus.

These facts along with poor understanding of CHIKV pathogenesis endorse that adaptive immunity has a big role in complete elimination of the virus, although adaptive immunity against CHIKV is still not fully characterized (Couderc et al., 2008; Schilte et al., 2010; Labadie et al., 2010; Her et al., 2010; Werneke et al., 2011; Gardner et al., 2010 Gardner et al., , 2012 Couderc et al., 2009) . Adaptive immunity works through the recognition of T cell epitopes by T lymphocytes by subsequent presentation of the antigen by HLA molecules. This trigger T cell mediated cytotoxicity and activates humoral immune response. Moreover, B cell receptors (BCR) recognize specific epitopes in their linear form and with the help of helper T cells differentiate into antibody producing plasma cells.

In a very contrasting scenario a very little has been done in case of Chikungunya virus. RNA viruses (e.g. Chikungunya virus) are more likely to mutate than other DNA viruses. Such a mutation in the envelope protein of the CHIKV virus brought it to the developed part of the world where despite of its benign nature it is long lasting debilitating symptoms caused serious concerns owing to socio-economic effects (Weaver, 2014) . As a result, recently a surge of activity principally concentrated on developing vaccine for Chikungunya virus has started but yet with no outcome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 501, "end": 514, "text": "(Fauci, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 515, "end": 536, "text": "Purcell et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 952, "end": 966, "text": "(Weaver, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 253, "text": "Fig. 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the present study we tried to identify major immunogenic epitopes on Chikungunya viral proteins using immune informatics tools and predict a vaccine along with novel inhibitors of Chikungunya virus envelope protein E2.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Traditional vaccination approaches are based on complete pathogen either live attenuated or inactivated. Among the major problems these vaccines brought are crucial safety concerns, because those pathogens being used for immunization may become activated and cause infection. Moreover due to genetic variation of pathogen strains around the world vaccines are likely to lose their efficacy in different regions or for a specific population. But novel vaccine approaches like DNA vaccines and epitope based vaccines have the potential to overcome these barriers for these vaccines can create more effective, specific, strong and long lasting immune response with minimal structure and devoid of all the undesired effects (Arnon, 2006) . On top of that neutralizing peptide based vaccine design has been successfully suggested by using in silico approach against rhinovirus (Lapelosa et al., 2009 ) dengue virus (Chakraborty et al., 2010) , Human coronaviruses (Sharmin and Islam, 2014) , Hepatitis C virus (Idrees and Ashfaq, 2013) , Saint Louis encephalitis virus (Hasan et al., 2013) . Such studies regarding those viruses established immunoinformatics study. Meanwhile, though most of the epitope based vaccines trigger the B-cell epitopes, T cell epitope based vaccines designs are inspired owing to a stronger CD8+ T-cell mediated immune response of the host cell to the infected T cells (Klavinskis et al., 1989) . Moreover, antigenic drifts might render humoral immunity and antigenic memory response non-effective and the pathogens pass through. T cell based vaccines are free of this limitation and along with a strong B cell epitope, a multi epitope vaccine is a good prospect which can trigger both cell mediated and humoral immune response (Trainor et al., 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 720, "end": 733, "text": "(Arnon, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 872, "end": 894, "text": "(Lapelosa et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 910, "end": 936, "text": "(Chakraborty et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 959, "end": 984, "text": "(Sharmin and Islam, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1030, "text": "(Idrees and Ashfaq, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1084, "text": "(Hasan et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1417, "text": "(Klavinskis et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1773, "text": "(Trainor et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A T cell epitope is considered strong and potent if it is well conserved among the sequenced CHIKV E2 proteins in the database.
