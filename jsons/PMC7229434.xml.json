            "text": "The landscape of pediatric intensive care has changed immensely since the advent of the first pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in the 1950s and 1960s [1]. Through advances in mechanical support, medications, and procedures, mortality has been greatly reduced [2], but many pediatric survivors of critical illnesses will experience long-term disabilities, higher readmission rates, and overall poorer health status [3\u20138]. Such knowledge of the harm of an ICU stay, initially described in the adult ICU population, led the movement to reevaluate ICU clinical practice patterns and culture. With increasing awareness of the long-term detriments of an ICU stay, the term post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) was coined to describe the combination of negative cognitive, psychological, and physical effects after critical illness [9, 10\u2022].",

Studies have shown up to 25% of children may display negative psychological and behavioral outcomes in the first year following PICU discharge including ongoing fears, changes in memory, attention span, cognitive functioning, self-esteem, or self-confidence, and a large proportion of PICU survivors may suffer from post-traumatic stress symptoms [13\u201315]. Several studies have described significant motor deficits and exacerbation of baseline physical disabilities in children post-ICU stay [4, 6, 16]. A systematic review published in 2017 found 19 studies documenting deficits in all three PICS domains in PICU survivors [12]. Although these pediatric cohort studies have found significant morbidities, it is difficult to compare data and estimate a true incidence due to varied outcomes scales and measures [12]. In addition to patient deficits, parents or family members of critically ill children can experience depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as well [13, 17].",

A compelling body of literature, mostly adult, surfaced to support several changes in clinical care to ameliorate PICS and the effects of an ICU stay. The ICU Liberation Collaborative was a quality improvement initiative hosted by the Society of Critical Care Medicine among 76 hospitals (67 adult and 9 pediatric) formed to implement and assess changes in clinical practice aimed at improving patient outcomes. The collaborative worked to integrate the ICU liberation bundle, also known as the ABCDEF bundle, in the care of their patients to mitigate the effects of an ICU stay [10\u2022]. Bundle implementation resulted in substantial improvements among adult ICU patients [18\u2022\u2022, 19]. In two large multicenter studies at varied types of ICUs [18\u2022\u2022, 19], even partial bundle implementation resulted in improvement in survival, mechanical ventilation use, coma, delirium, restraint-free care, ICU readmissions, and post-ICU discharge disposition. Furthermore, the data supported a dose-response relationship, in which a higher proportion of bundle compliance correlated with improved clinical outcomes. Although pediatric data is limited, these results have further supported the use of the ABCDEF bundle in all ICU patients, including PICU patients.",

These domains are consistent with domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a widely-used framework in implementation science [92].

Further emphasis should be placed on investigating the effect the ICU liberation bundle, as well as each individual bundle element, has on survival and morbidity related to critical illness in pediatrics. Similarly, PICS may be a significant issue for survivors of pediatric illness and their families, but no unified scales exist in the literature to be able to truly quantify the incidence of this problem. Unified outcomes scales are needed in order to better understand both the factors that predispose patients to developing PICS as well as improve long-term outcomes from those affected by PICS after hospital discharge.",

One novel and developing approach to improving the lives of survivors of critical illness is the development of ICU follow-up clinics. This outpatient support has been used as part of post-ICU recovery models for some adult units after ICU discharge, though its impact on recovery remains largely unknown. This intervention has not been adopted widely, nor has it been studied extensively in the pediatric population. With advances in technology and the availability of telemedicine services, future research should explore whether a model for ICU follow-up can further improve the after-ICU recovery for critically ill pediatric patients and their families.",

Widespread ICU liberation bundle implementation in pediatrics with systematic outcome monitoring and analysis will be essential for further advances in outcomes for pediatric survivors of critical illness.",
