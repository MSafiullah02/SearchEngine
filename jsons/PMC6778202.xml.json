However, when such scenraio will transpire, we will be challenged by a competition between the infectious pathogen and the therapeutic technology, each racing to reach the majority of the population first. This competition confronts us with several challenges: (i) the inevitable response time tR required for us to instigate a mitigation plan places the pathogen at a potentially significant spreading advantage; (ii) while the pathogen reproduces as it spreads1\u20133, a therapy must be manufactured and shipped from one or few sources, whose production capacity may be limited4\u201312; (iii) under global demand we must ship the therapeutics worldwide, stretching the bounds of our limited transportation resources.",

It would na\u00efvely seem that winning this competition relies on rapid production and shipping capacity. However, here we show that due to the different spreading dynamics - drug dissemination becomes intrinsically inefficient when faced with global demand. The source of this inefficiency is rooted, not in production/shipping rates, but rather in the fact that network-based commodity flow leads to an uneven, and hence highly ineffective, supply of the therapeutic. As a consequence, we show that for a sufficiently large network, even unrealistically optimistic production/shipping capacities remain insufficient.",

Such major interventions, however, are not just impractical, but may also lead to significant economic loss and major political stress \u2013 indeed, a lesser of two evils, but still a potentially hurtful toll on global stability.",

This bypasses the distribution networks, and allows a more leveled spread of the therapeutic. We consider the fact that such decentralization might, under some conditions, exhibit lower production capacity, if, for instance, the local synthesis is inefficient, or the therapeutic efficacy is sub-optimal. However, as we show that equality precedes capacity, we find that this strategy consistently prevails thanks to its egalitarian nature, even if inferior in many other relevant parameters, e.g., production rate, response time or therapeutic efficacy. Hence, the merits of decentralization overcome its potential practical shortcomings, calling on us to urgently develop decentralized mitigation capabilities.",

            "text": "Given the complexity of drug production, decentralization seems, at first glance, unfeasible \u2013 how can each local population manufacture their own therapeutics? However, recent breakthroughs suggest that decentralized mitigation is limited by perception, rather than by technology. Indeed, certain types of therapeutics can be converted into digital information, handled and distributed as data, and then locally printed, i.e. synthesized, at their designated destination (Box 1, Section A). Such digital shipping of, e.g., DNA sequences, vaccines or therapeutic agents, is, already in use16\u201318, hence the relevant technology is, in fact, currently available. However, at present, this technology remains unscalable under global demand. We, therefore, continue to lack decentralized mitigation capabilities, a lacuna that is primarily driven by the current absence of motivation to scale-up our printing capacity, as indeed, the crucial advantages of decentralization are yet unrecognized. Following our analysis below, exposing the unequivocal merits of decentralized mitigation, we wish to prompt its development as a future response to global epidemics. This entails advancing the already existing technological pathways towards practical implementation at a global scale \u2013 a goal that, given the appropriate motivation, we believe is within our reach. In Section A we present specific guidelines for economically viable decentralized mitigation, showing that, under achievable reduction in costs, an annual investment of 50\u2013500 USD per individual is sufficient to set up the required infrastructure within approximately one decade.",

Counter-intuitively, these results are unrelated to the faster dissemination of digital compared to physical media. Indeed, this distinction between the speed of data versus that of physical commodities was not even introduced into our modeling of the dissemination in Eqs. (15) and (16), and hence, it plays no role in the decentralized advantage. We, therefore, conclude that decentralization provides intrinsic merits that go beyond the classic measures of production rates or shipping capacity.

Indeed, we find that during the global peak infection, Tpeak, the infection distribution P(j) is bounded, capturing a state in which the majority of nodes simultaneously require treatment (Fig. 4c,e).

These may affect the specific rates and pre-factors, but have little bearing on the scaling exponents, which are, indeed, intrinsic to the spreading dynamics. Therefore, as long as the epidemic spreads globally \u2013 a scenario often considered imminent - centralized mitigation requires prohibitive manufacturing and shipping capacities (Fig. 4h); in their absence \u2013 the epidemic will inevitably outrun the therapeutics (Fig. 4i,j).

Once these networks are set, the spread of the therapeutic is governed by diffusion, which is often sub-optimal, allowing, e.g., for superfluous quantities to accumulate at selected locations. We can improve dissemination efficiency by modeling it as a commodity flow problem30,31, seeking to optimally utilize the routes of the existing air-traffic network, until meeting the demands of all destinations32,33. In this framework, each air-route is assigned a carrying capacity Cnm, capturing the number of doses it can transport per day, and each destination n is assigned an initial demand dn(0), depending on the size of its local population Mn.

We are also motivated by recent reviews16,70 that expose the therapeutic potential of DNA aptamers, citing the major obstacle towards their biomedical applicability as the lagging research rather than any intrinsic therapeutic deficiency they possess.

Present day oligonucleotide synthesizers are capable of synthesizing \u223c10 gram/day of a short oligonucleotide, at a cost of \u223c500 USD, requiring thorough purification, and generating, as a byproduct, large amounts of liquid waste. For RNA nucleosides, LNA, or other modified materials, the cost becomes approximately 10 times higher, i.e. \u223c5,000 USD per 10 grams. Combined with the current cost of the required instrumentation, estimated at \u223c2.5 \u00d7 105 USD, we believe, that despite the unequivocal advantages of decentralization, it is currently of limited applicability at a global scale. This status-quo, however, is a consequence of our current priorities, rather than an intrinsic technological restriction. Indeed, the need for scalable low-cost mass-printing of short DNA sequences was not evident until now, and hence the development of the relevant technology was never prioritized. Our findings, together with the potential usefulness of such therapeutics16,70, suggest reassessing these priorities.",

Our analysis indicates that cn \u223c 0.2, a distributed coverage of approximately 20%, can efficiently tackle a virulent epidemic. Hence, to implement decentralized mitigation capabilities we must aim for local production capacity of the order of 2 \u00d7 105 doses per day \u2013 printing and locally disseminating \u2013 per each population of 106 individuals.

Once achieved, the infrastructure for decentralized mitigation can be established over the course of \u223c10 years with an annual investment of 5\u201350 USD per person.

            "text": "Figure 5: Optimizing centralized mitigation. (a) To enhance the efficiency of the centralized drug distribution we used the commodity flow framework: each node is assigned an initial demand dn(0), proportional to its population (node size); and each air-route is assigned a daily carrying capacity Cnm (numbers by edges), proportional to its daily volume of passenger traffic. In each time step t we optimize the flow from the source s to supply as much of the therapeutic as possible, within the constrained Cnm. As nodes accumulate the therapeutic (blue fill) their demand is updated accordingly. For example, node 2\u2019s initial demand is d2(0) = 3. Following the first round of shipment (t = 1) a single unit is shipped from s, supplying a fraction \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${f}_{2}(1)=1/3$$\\end{document}f2(1)=1/3 of d2(0), and hence reducing its demand to d2(1) = 2.

(b) The Gini coefficient vs. t, as obtained from the time dependent fractional stock levels fn(t).
