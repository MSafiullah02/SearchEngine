These are parts of the conceptual tools in various medical-related fields. A definition of each concept is imperative because they constitute parts of the analytical tools in medical sociology. The lack of consensus often prevents uniformity of interpretations and generates more polemics. One wonders why there has not been consensus, despite the long history of medicine. The concepts are multidimensional, complex, and often elusive. For instance, Larson (1999) observed that disagreements about the meaning of health are common because health is imbued with political, medical, social, economic, and spiritual components. It is subject to various conceptualisation and interpretations. While all the concepts have their foundations in medicine, a biomedical perspective of health or disease may not be comprehensive enough. However, a fusion of the various perspectives often presents a complex definition like the WHO\u2019s definition of health . This is why the debate on the definition of health is still ongoing. That the debate continues is not a problem as refinement of definition could lead to a better conceptualisation.",

Notwithstanding, various scholars, apart from the definition given by the WHO, have defined the concept. Although it is not the first definition of health, the WHO\u2019s definition will still be the starting point because it is relatively old and has been central to the debate on the meaning of health. WHO (1948) defined health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease and infirmity. The definition is holistic, and it presents three major interrelated components of health (see Fig. 2.1).",

            "text": "\n\nThe physical: this is the physiological or biological component of the definition. It simply implies the maintenance of homoeostasis. This is often used to infer a soundness of the body. Most often, disease represents a malfunction of a part of the body system or an intrusion of harmful organisms such as a virus or parasite. This may cause a breakdown of the individual affected. This physiological aspect is the most important biomedical criterion in the determination of health. For someone to be healthy, his/her biological components must be in order. A major diagnosis procedure involves a determination of what could be wrong with any component of the body or detection of any intrusion of any anti-body by tracing the pathways of the disease from underlying causes to pathology in the human body system and examination of any emerging of symptoms. Determining this may involve a series of laboratory tests or clinical examinations. One may be certified as healthy if there is no detection of any biological hitch.\nThe social: this represents the behavioural aspect of human health. Being a member of society is being in the network of social interaction and being able to fulfil social roles and expectations. If an individual is not active in the social network, it represents a form of social pathology \u2014an abnormality, which is an infraction on the norms and values of society. The social also incorporates the spiritual dimension. The spiritual aspect could be personal to the individual by connecting to the world of reality and divinity. Larson (1999) observed that since the WHO\u2019s definition of health, medicine has treated individuals as social beings whose health is affected by social behaviour and interaction.\nThe mental: this indicates the psychological, emotional, and mental status of the individual. Emotional apathy, fixation, and maladjusted personality constitute a part of the manifestation of illness. Huber et al. (2011) observed that the mental aspect of health signifies the possession of a \u201csense of coherence,\u201d which includes the subjective faculties enhancing the comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness of any circumstances.\n",

For instance, Awofeso (2012) observed that the definition is inflexible and unrealistic. He claimed that the inclusion of the word \u201ccomplete\u201d in the definition makes it unlikely for anyone to be healthy for a reasonable period of time. Godlee (2011) also noted that the definition is absolute and therefore unachievable for most people in the world. The definition presents an absolute ideal situation by combining the three aspects of human life. It is often difficult, if not impossible, to gain complete contentment in all the aspects. It is observed that since health is a goal, not only of the health care system but also individual and the society at large, it is ideal for a body like WHO to present a realistic definition that can be operationalised and achievable (Godlee 2011) .",

He further argued that the WHO\u2019s definition reflects that health is boundless. More so, Huber et al. (2011, p. 2) opined that the WHO\u2019s definition is problematic because it impliedly declares people with chronic diseases and disabilities definitively ill. The definition further minimises \u201cthe role of the human capacity to cope autonomously with life\u2019s ever changing physical, emotional, and social challenges and to function with fulfilment and a feeling of wellbeing with a chronic disease or disability\u201d (Huber et al. 2011, p. 2) . Despite several decades of criticisms, the WHO has not reviewed the definition. The idea of a definition is to present a holistic view that is meaningful not only for individuals but also as a (definitive) tool in scientific investigation. The idea is not to advance an operational perfection that is unchangeable. Perhaps, there is yet a review because there has not been a more holistic and measurable alternative definition of health. The question is simple: are other definitions of \u201chealth\u201d more operational?",

Some of these definitions will be critically examined; however, the essence of examining other definitions is not to defend the WHO\u2019s definition or to render such alternative definitions as immaterial. After some strictures of WHO\u2019s definition of health by Saracci (1997, p. 1410) , he proposed a definition of health as \u201ca condition of wellbeing, free of disease or infirmity, and a basic and universal human right.\u201d Impliedly, this definition also defined those who are living positively with chronic disease as unhealthy. It presents a health as a basic right, which is also problematic. In most parts of the world, health is a commodity with an insurance premium, a price-tag, or it requires a pool from the public tax. This also seems like a theoretical proposition that is not operational. It does not really account for the multidimensionality of health.

One major problem with model-based definition is that there could be more models than expected. The model-approach does not present a whole definition. Later, every profession will likely present a model of health beyond common understanding, and this will generate more issues.

This is more a sociological approach to health\u2014a conceptualisation of health as a social element. Health in this sociological sense is more inclined towards human capacity to fulfil their obligations, participate in social activities (including work), and fulfil role expectations in the society in the face of structural limitations. This conception is connected with both physiological and mental models of health in the sense that the source of a social incapacitation could be from a biological or mental limitation.

By replacing perfection with adaptation, we get closer to a more compassionate, comforting, and creative programme for medicine\u2014one to which we can all contribute.\u201d The major strength of this definition is that it takes account of the shift in health challenges in the twenty-first century. Unlike the period before World War II when acute diseases were more prevalent than chronic diseases, now the latter constitutes a greater burden. Chronic diseases require behavioural adjustments in terms of self-care or management (see Sects. 2.6.2 and 10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_8#Sec3\n). This is why the idea of adaptation seems to be more current than that of \u201ca complete state.\u201d",

This implies how different individuals define health, which explains the relativity of the concept. The lay concept of health is essentially subjective because it is based on people\u2019s own assessment and judgment of whether they are healthy or not. Blaxter (1990, p. 40) observed that the most \u201cusual way of measuring self-perceived illness, as distinct from the presence or absence of disease, is by means of symptom lists.\u201d To the lay population, absence of symptoms means health. From this perspective, Blaxter (1990) identified the three \u201cstates\u201d of health: freedom from illness, ability to function, and fitness. In this regards, health is also perceived as energy and vitality in terms of fitness for functions: physical, social and normative activities .",

Construction of health stems from the lay perspective or individual\u2019s appraisal of state of health, which can be good or bad. Such construction also includes what a particular society qualifies as \u201chealth.\u201d For instance, labelling reactivity (people\u2019s reaction to a particular condition) might influence designation or conceptualisation of health or illness in a particular society (see sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_8#Sec5\nfor labeling theory). Experiential knowledge of health is phenomenological\u2014derived from feeling of wellness or otherwise, which emanate from the presence or absence of personal discomfort and pain. In terms of \u201cenactment\u201d of health, the central consideration includes what people do to maintain their health. Health is also a dynamic attribute because it fluctuates across biographical, historical and contextual milieus. The state of health varies across lifespan, and is influenced by a number of factors including personal (e.g., lifestyle) and structural factors (e.g., access to health care) (see Chapter four).

Whichever form the definition takes, the question now is \u201cwhat constitutes a disease?\u201d One major issue is that disease is often conceived from a biomedical point of view. It can also have behavioural manifestations, especially with regard to human functionality. The definition of health is complex, so also is the definition of a disease. If the lack of health can be defined as not a mere absence of a disease or infirmity, this signifies that there are a number of germ- and non-germ-related (medical) conditions that can signify the presence of a disease. This, however, also makes the definition of a disease complex because of variations in its conceptions. Mainly, Boorse (1975, 1977) was engrossed in a practical and philosophical discussion of what health and disease may entail. He defined disease as a type of internal state which impairs health (i.e., reduces one or more functional ability below typical efficiency). One major criticism of this definition is the use of \u201ctypical efficiency,\u201d which implies the presence of a reference group in the definition of disease (Kingma 2007; Stempsey 2000)\nas a kind of comparative analysis. This view is often referred to as a bio-statistical theory (BST) of health and disease. Kingma (2007) argued that human species are different in functional capacity: what is normal in one group can be abnormal in another and vice versa. Therefore, Boorse\u2019s definition of health or disease is only valid depending on the reference group.",

Whitlow is a typical condition that could impose considerable pain on the sufferer, although it requires a simple medical procedure to resolve. A reason why the argument about pain may not be sufficient is because there are a number of normal procedures that require medical attention as a result of pain and discomfort, but are not diseases, such as teething, menstruation , childbirth , and abortion.\nTreatment by physicians: normally diseases require the attention of medical doctors. A disease should be treatable. However, Boorse submitted that there are some conditions that cannot be treated, and doctors also attend to a number of conditions that are not diseases. With medicalisation of life, there are medical expansions beyond treatment of disease, such as certification of fitness for a study or travel. More so, circumcision, body modification or enhancement, and family planning procedures cannot be regarded as diseases but require attention of a physician.\nStatistical normality: the species\u2019 average level of performance becomes a yardstick for determining normality and abnormality. There is also a measure of statistical normality of clinical variables such as blood pressure, basal metabolism, weight, sugar level, height, pulse, and respiration. Any measure beyond the normal range is usually termed as an abnormality or a disease condition and signifies the need for medical attention. When normal blood pressure ends, there begins hypotension or hypertension . This average of normality is derived from the rate of mortality or functionality within normal and abnormal ranges. It is assumed that mortality or dysfunctionality is often higher when below or above normal ranges. This may not always be the case as clinical variables are measures of probability or propensity to a disease.\nDisability: disease could also lead to many forms of disability. Poliomyelitis is a typical example of a disease that can cause physical deformity. In another case, a disease may reduce active participation of an individual in the social network, such as the inability to walk or stand. Pregnancy , for instance, could not count as a disease even though it comes with some limitations. A number of skin diseases may not count as disease since they may not present with disabling effects.\nAdaptation: the ability to adapt to the environment has also been categorised as a form of healthiness while those who are not fit are presumably diseased. Lack of adaptation prevents an individual from meeting the average level of a species\u2019 functionality. The presence of eumelanin pigmentation in the skins of black Africans helps in adapting to their environment, but it does not mean those with pheomelanin pigmentation cannot survive in Africa or that Africans cannot survive elsewhere. Environmental can even inflict suffering on humans in the process of adaptations.\nHomeostasis: health is a state of bodily equilibrium while disease is a state of homeostatic failure. But the process of human growth as Boorse observed is itself leading to homeostatic disequilibrium .\nValue: disease is undesirable while health is desirable. Health is thus a social value in human society. However, it is also impossible to exclusively delineate disease from the point of undesirability. Conditions such as shortness and ugliness cannot be counted as diseases even though they may not be desirable.\n",

Illness is a presentation of a medical condition in a way that limits the functional capability of an individual in the society. This is why Nordenfeldt (1993) observed that to be ill is to be in pain, to be anxious, or to be disabled. The notion of illness fits appropriately into the concept of sick role described by Parsons (1951). It is a situation when an individual consciously feels that he/she is unhealthy, sometimes as a result of discomfort and pain. Therefore, illness is the live-experience of a diseased condition. While a diseased patient might not be real (i.e., without a self-awareness of the condition), an ill patient is real.",

Cultural and historical experiences affect this causal classification of illness (see Sect. 2.7). If it is an illness that is common in the community, a remedy may be available without much process of diagnosis.The third is the evaluation of therapeutic options. This is often influenced by aetiological classification. Different societies have a number of causal explanations. Although natural causation is predominant in western societies, there are other etiological classifications. The same situation applies to the non-western societies. Fabrega (1973) , for instance, opined that the social definition of illness forms the basis of a decision about medical treatment.The last aspect is reintegration into the social system following perceived wellness. This is also very important as the society plays a large role in absorbing a previously ill individual back into the social system.

Mental problems frequently manifest with behavioural changes that represent an infraction on the social norms of the society. A mental disorder is socially disastrous to the individual and could lead to total incapacitation or exemption from normal roles in the society. There are two major divisions of mental illness, which include neurosis (minor) and psychosis (major). While the former does not usually involve organic (brain) breakdown, the latter usually does. Examples of neurosis include: obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobia, dissociative disorder, minor depression, hypochondria, hysteria, and puerperal neurosis. Psychosis involves loss of contact with reality. It is generally the worst form of mental disorder. Examples of psychosis include bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, substance-induced mental disorder, dementia (Alzheimer), delusional disorder, and epilepsy. A mental disorder may not necessarily lead to death, but it is disabling\u2014it could be acute or chronic. Sartorius (2007) observed that stigma attached to mental illness is the main obstacle to the provision of care for people living with mental disorders. The stigma is a mark or label on those who are ill and their generations (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_8#Sec6\nfor the theory of stigma).",

The idea can also be applied in cases of injuries and accidents . This idea serves as a coping mechanism and aids reintegration into the society. Since it is the will of God, discrimination is termed against the will of God. It helps the individual to live and surrender to destiny, fate, or an act of God.
