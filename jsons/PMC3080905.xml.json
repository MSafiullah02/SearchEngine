Soon after X-rays were discovered in 1895, the human thorax was found to be an excellent substrate for imaging, because the air-filled lungs provided a low-density background against which areas of consolidation and other structural changes could be visualized. The value of chest radiography for assessing the severity of respiratory tract infections was firmly established during the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which the new radiologic capabilities were widely implemented to study patients and to correlate imaging with pathologic and clinical findings [9]. At the same time, it was recognized that the radiographic changes typical of severe influenza were also observed in other conditions, both infectious and noninfectious. The ability of chest radiographs to detect and discriminate disease processes was also restricted by overlapping projections of soft tissues. Although this problem was partly mitigated by the development of CT, which enabled major advances in image resolution, the sensitivity and specificity of radiographic imaging remain limited by the absence of unique features to distinguish infection from inflammation and by the lack of standardized scoring systems for disease severity [9, 10]. The value of chest radiographs and CT for research is also restricted by the difficulty of obtaining direct radiologic-pathologic correlation, because lung tissue samples from patients with influenza are only examined when a case ends in death, followed by autopsy.",

In cases of mild, self-limited illness, in which lesions apparently remain localized to the upper respiratory tract (Figure 1D), the chest radiograph is either normal or displays only minor changes. The development of more severe disease is typically marked by the appearance of multiple patchy densities in one or both lungs, in a multilobar peripheral distribution (Figure 1A). By CT, these areas are termed ground-glass opacities (GGO) because of the hazy density of the lesions, in which the margins of bronchi and blood vessels are partially visible (Figure 1B). Autopsy findings suggest that GGO correspond to foci of viral pneumonitis and/or diffuse alveolar damage (Figure 1E). However, GGO are also seen in a variety of other pulmonary diseases, both infectious and noninfectious, in which they may reflect partial airspace filling, interstitial cellular infiltration or edema, capillary congestion, or a combination of these factors [10, 12, 14]. CT imaging of some patients with swine-origin H1N1 influenza has also shown consolidative patterns, in which the increased lesion density obscures all parenchymal structures except for some traversing open airways (air bronchograms), consistent with either severe viral injury or bacterial pneumonia (Figure 1C, 1E) [12, 15].",

However, the spectrum of radiographic changes seen in the epidemic largely resembled that observed in the swine-origin H1N1 influenza pandemic (Figure 2A, B) [16]. In both influenza and SARS, patients with severe illness show patchy, bilateral infiltrates by chest radiograph and multifocal GGO on CT. Because the radiographic findings are not specific, a diagnosis of SARS could only be made if a patient gave a history of contact with a person with a known case. However, radiography still contributed to medical management by identifying patients in need of intensive supportive care and by assessing their response to therapy [1, 17]. In contrast to severely ill patients with influenza, in many of whom influenza progressed to bacterial pneumonia, fatal cases of SARS were typically characterized by the progressive expansion of areas of GGO to involve both lungs [17]. In the only radiographic study in laboratory animals, pulmonary airspace opacities were observed in cynomolgus macaques infected with the SARS coronavirus by the respiratory route (Figure 3), but a radiologic-pathologic correlation was not obtained [18].",

In particular, it is not known whether influenza and other viral infections are initially limited to the upper respiratory tract or whether severe pulmonary involvement is the result of a more diffuse initial disease process. Similarly, the mechanisms responsible for the development of pulmonary infiltrates and GGO have not been identified, and it is not known to what extent respiratory dysfunction is the result of viral infection and injury of the respiratory tract epithelium or is induced by the local or systemic release of inflammatory mediators. The factors that predispose some patients to the development of fatal bacterial superinfection are also poorly understood. Imaging methods that are not based on tissue structural changes, but on the detection of specific biochemical processes, may be able to answer such questions.",

PET imaging probes emit positrons, which travel a short distance in tissues before undergoing annihilation, producing 2 high-energy photons traveling in 180\u00b0 opposite directions that strike surrounding detectors simultaneously. By using highly energetic photons of a single frequency, PET reduces soft-tissue attenuation, scatter, and noise. However, a limiting factor in PET resolution is the distance that the positron must travel through tissues before undergoing annihilation. In contrast, the various radiotracers used for SPECT imaging release single photons, with a range of energies depending on the decay characteristics of the radionuclide.",

Moreover, as a cross-sectional technique, SPECT provides significant advantages over planar nuclear medicine imaging for locating sites of disease.

Because deoxyglucose is taken up by cells and phosphorylated but not further metabolized, the radiotracer is selectively trapped in cells with high rates of glycolysis. FDG - PET imaging has a flourishing oncologic literature, based on the detection of active neoplasms with elevated glycolysis by combining PET with CT, which has greater sensitivity and specificity than either method alone. In contrast, relatively few data have yet been published to support a role for FDG - PET and/or CT in infectious diseases imaging. In clinical practice, FDG - PET and/or CT can also visualize inflammatory processes, both infectious and noninfectious, via nonspecific uptake of the tracer by multiple types of white blood cells, including lymphocytes and neutrophils. Therefore, FDG - PET and/or CT can theoretically be a useful tool for measuring inflammatory responses to infection [38]. For example, FDG has been used to visualize the response to the introduction of endotoxin into the lungs of human volunteers (Figure 6) [39, 40]. This suggests that FDG - PET could be particularly useful for imaging the inflammatory response to severe respiratory viral infections, because studies of human cases and experimental models in mice and ferrets indicate that acute inflammatory responses play a critical role in the severe respiratory dysfunction induced by the 1918 H1N1 and the H5N1 avian influenza viruses and by the SARS coronavirus [19, 41\u201346]. Radionuclide imaging of experimental influenza or SARS coronavirus infections could help to resolve the question of whether anti-inflammatory therapies are beneficial or harmful for these conditions [47\u201351].",

One possible approach would be to design radiolabeled probes that bind with high affinity to virus-encoded molecules or that are substrates for a virus-encoded enzyme (Table 2). An example of the latter is the herpesviral TK, which phosphorylates thymidine analogues that are not substrates for the host enzyme. Compounds, such as acyclovir and its analogues, can therefore be used both as antiviral drugs for the treatment of herpesviral infections and as radiolabeled tracers to detect sites of replication or recombinant TK expression [56]. The method has been used to image experimental herpesviral infections of tumors, but its use for visualizing herpesviral encephalitis has been limited by the requirement for the probe to penetrate the blood-brain barrier [57\u201359].",

Although MRI has been used to study the effects of influenza on the central nervous system and the heart, it has yet to be applied in published research on pulmonary influenza or other respiratory viral infections. However, advances in pulmonary MRI and MRI-compatible cell labeling are providing a unique opportunity for these studies. For example, inflammatory cells loaded ex vivo with antiviral drugs or nanoparticles have been demonstrated to localize to sites of infection [71, 72]. SPIO particles, which cause local magnetic susceptibility artifacts, are particularly useful for studying inflammatory processes, because they are detectible as dark (hypointense) regions much larger than the particles themselves, rendering them visible even when only a few cells are labeled (Figure 8B) [73]. Although promising for identifying areas of inflammation in solid organs, such as the brain, these methods may prove to be less useful for studying respiratory tract infections, because dark areas of diminished signal intensity at sites of SPIO particle uptake may resemble normal lung.",

For example, mice in which luciferase expression is driven by the IFN-\u03b2 promoter have been used to characterize type I IFN responses to wild-type and recombinant influenza A viruses, (Figure 11) [22, 81]. Thus, BLI makes it possible to perform a variety of studies that could serve as proofs of concept for further investigation in large animals and in humans.",

SPECT, PET, MRI, and BLI offer molecular imaging techniques that could potentiate the discovery of new biomarkers for predicting disease progression and supporting the development of novel therapies targeting viral replication or damaging host responses. Although new diseases, such as novel H1N1 influenza and SARS, will inevitably continue to emerge, molecular imaging can help to reduce their impact on public health by elucidating their pathogenetic mechanisms.",
