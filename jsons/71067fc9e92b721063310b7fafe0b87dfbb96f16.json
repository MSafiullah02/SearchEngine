The discipline of palliative medicine prides itself on patient autonomy and fulfilment of personal care preferences. We believe that each patient is unique with needs based on personal experiences and cultural, familial and social influences. These considerations impact how we communicate and treat each patient. Similarly, for policy makers drafting infection control measures in the COVID-19 pandemic, cultural and societal norms warrant special consideration to ensure that measures implemented are acceptable and feasible to the general public.",

These include the closing of most businesses except essential services like healthcare, the shutting of schools and the restriction of movements and gathering of people. 3 What followed was a noticeably non-compliance of these measures by the elderly, who continued to gather in market-places and travelled between households. 4 The prime minister subsequently had to make a special televised appeal to the elderly to adhere to the instituted measures as the elderly are at a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. 5 This disregard of the restrictions, like a \"non-compliant\" patient refusing to take oral morphine for his cancer pain, would have been duly investigated by the palliative care physician looking for concerns of addiction and side-effects.",

Social-distancing means that such activities are no longer possible. This disruption in the daily routine of the elderly erodes the image of the \"ideal\" independent elderly. Like the terminally ill patient who refuses to move in to stay with his children, the fear of being perceived as even being potentially a burden to the family may overshadow even the most severe financial disincentive for breaking the law.",

Filial piety, which is defined by the principle of non-abandonment motivates carers of the frail or sick elderly to continue traveling between households to provide care. Restrictions on traveling are particularly agonising for families who need to support an elderly patient with cancer, who may wish to achieve a home death with home hospice support. Reciprocally, the elderly sick may also perceive themselves as a threat to the harmony of the family unit by being a source of emotional, financial and physical burden. This complex web of reciprocal familial obligations and self-sacrifice across both the patient and family members is commonly witnessed in the practice of palliative medicine.",

Financial and caregiving limitations can be tackled with relevant assistance schemes by the palliative care social workers according to individual circumstances While there is strong incentive for the implementation of strict measures in the COVID-19 pandemic, awareness and compassion goes a long way in ensuring that these measures remain effective and acceptable.
