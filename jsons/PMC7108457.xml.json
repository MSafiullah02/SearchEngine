Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are one family of viruses associated with respiratory tract infections.1 Five HCoVs are currently known to infect the respiratory tract: HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were first identified in the late 1960s and are well recognised as important pathogens that cause the common cold. In 2003, human coronaviruses received worldwide attention with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The increase in research on these viruses soon led to the discovery of two other human coronaviruses: in 2004, HCoV-NL63 was described in the Netherlands, and, in 2005, HCoV-HKU1 was described in China.2, 3 Previous reports have documented HCoV-NL63 infections worldwide and have revealed that infection occurs without gender, age or geographic boundaries and can account for 5% of all acute respiratory infections in the hospital, especially during the winter.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 The most frequently observed clinical manifestations in HCoV-NL63-infected patients are fever, cough, coryza, sore throat, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and croup.4 We described the clinical pattern of severe respiratory disease with a fatal outcome caused by HCoV-NL-63 in a Brazilian adult patient hospitalised at Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo (a tertiary-university health center). The patient was originally suspected of having an H1N1 2009 infection during the second pandemic wave of the influenza activity.",

She had been referred to the emergency room 5 days of fever (40 \u00b0C), productive cough, coryza, sore throat and inapetence. In addition, the patient had one day of dyspnea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The physical examination on admission was as follows: 35 \u00b0C axillary temperature; heart and respiratory rates of 130 bpm and 32 per min, respectively; high blood pressure (170/100 mmHg); blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 90%; and capillary glycemia of 400 mg/dl. Lung evaluation revealed alteration of breath sounds (shortness of breath at the left base and diffuse rhonchus); and the chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, without signs of consolidation or effusion. No other signs or symptoms of additional organ involvement were noted. A lower respiratory tract infection of probable viral aetiology was diagnosed.",

Measurement of arterial blood gas tensions showed ketoacidosis (pH: 7.05; pCO2: 20.4 mmHg; pO2: 70.5 mmHg; HCO3: 5.4 mEq/l; BE: \u221224.8; SatO2: 41.7%). Serological tests were negative for HIV, HBV and HCV. Laboratory tests were performed again upon hospital admission (Table 1\n). A hypothesis of rhabdomyolysis was also considered. The initial treatment was hydration, insulin time-pump (50 UI-intravenous), ceftriaxone (2 g per day), clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day) and oseltamivir (150 mg per day). On Day 1 after admission, due to a worsening of the patient\u0301s breathing pattern, lowered consciousness and hypotension, the patient was admitted to the ICU, received a vasopressor drug and was maintained with oxygen therapy followed by tracheal intubation with spontaneous purulent drainage. Cefepime and steroids treatments were then introduced. Positive and expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 12 mmHg, and FiO2 was 40%. The Glasgow scale registered 15. The patient\u0301s condition escalated requiring increased doses of intravenous insulin and PEEP parameters. An acute renal failure occurred, and the anuric patient underwent a haemodialysis procedure. Glycemic peaks were observed, and vasopressor drugs were administrated. On Day 3 after admission, due to a worsening of the clinical and ventilator parameters, a bronchoscopy was performed and showed haemorrhagic pneumonia. Staphylococcus spp. were cultured from the tracheal aspiration specimen, but blood cultures were negative. Blood gas analysis revealed improvement of the metabolic levels compared to initial values when ketoacidosis was diagnosed (pH 7.41; pCO2: 35 mmHg; pO2: 136 mmHg; HCO3: 22.1 mEq/l; BE: \u22121.6). An echocardiogram was performed and revealed pericardial effusion without signs of endocarditis. Findings upon physical examination revealed polyarthritis and edema in the upper extremities, but negative results were obtained for nuclear antibodies (ANAs). On Day 8 after admission, the patient had two cardiac respiratory arrests (6 min each) due to hypoxia that were reversed. Severe hypotension without response to noradrenalin and other interventions was irreversible. During hospitalisation, laboratory and clinical findings revealed leukocytosis and fever (Table 1). A CT-scan of the patient\u0301s skull was performed and demonstrated brain edema. On Day 9 after admission, the patient was declared brain dead.Virological investigations",

A real-time PCR assay with primers and probes for influenza A, swine flu A, swine H1 and RNaseP (SuperScript III, Invitrogen) were performed following the protocol recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).12 The viral targets of the real-time PCR assay were: influenza A gene M (matrix) and influenza swine H1N12009 gene HA (hemagglutinin) and gene NP (nucleoprotein). After a negative result for influenza virus was obtained, RT-PCR assays targeting other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human coronaviruses NL63, HKU-1, 229E and OC43, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus) were performed using protocols previously described9, 13, 24, 25, 27 and PCR was performed to detect adenovirus following protocols previously described.26 Only HCoV-NL63 was detected in the samples after RNA amplification. Sequencing was performed to confirm the specificity of the RT-PCR assay using the pancoronavirus primers as previously described9 with an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction kit on an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2018s instructions. The obtained sequences were compared with the prototypical HCoVs sequences available in the GenBank database (NC_005831, AY563107-8 and AY758276-822, 30) release 142.0 using BLAST analysis (NCBI BLAST server), which confirmed that the virus detected within the sample was HCoV-NL63.",

The most common clinical symptoms found in coronavirus-infected patients were headache, muscle pain, sore throat, chills and runny nose.14 Another study reported one HCoV-NL63-infected elderly Canadian patient who died 5 days after the onset of disease, showing that the severity of the respiratory disease can be substantial.19 The involvement of other organ systems that are non-respiratory is still controversial but can occur, for example the enteric and nervous systems can be involved.15, 28\n",

This infection is implicated in a more severe outcome than a mild viral respiratory disease. Rhabdomyolysis, diagnosed by an elevated creatine phosphokinase level and the renal impairment, was also documented. Rhabdomyolysis has been described among patients with others viral infections, such as Influenza A and SARS-associated coronavirus. The cause of acute renal failure could be associated with pre-renal factors, for example hypotension, rhabdomyolysis and the previously documented diabetic condition. An echocardiogram revealed pericarditis, showing that the virus had possibly reached the pericardial space via blood viremia following a respiratory tract infection. Due to no serum available, we could not test for HCoV-NL63 since a positive signal would have strengthened the hypothesis of NL63-involvement in a systemic infection.",
