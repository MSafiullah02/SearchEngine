The major drivers responsible for the initiation of this new revolution were the development of a plethora of varied nano-drug delivery systems, not only by the academic institutions but also by industrial organizations. This led to the availability of a huge database comprising several research papers and patents from all over world, describing these new dosage forms. Numerous funding agencies and industries actively promoted research into nanoparticulate drug delivery vehicles and huge investments were made to this end. All these diverse and concurrent efforts created an awareness about the immense potential of these new drug delivery systems, which were then looked upon as therapeutic regimens of the future.",

            "text": "\nThere are many reasons behind the development and success of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems. A few years ago, the entire attention of pharmaceutical industry was focused on the novel developments in designing various dosage forms, primarily due to expiry of the existing patents, a surfeit of poorly soluble drug candidates and the problems of non-specificity from conventional dosage forms. Under these circumstances, the development of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems gained huge momentum due to a number of diverse factors listed in the following section of this chapter.\u25a0The pharmaceutical industries were poised to provide quality products to the patient, at the same time increasing or maintaining their profitability. However, this process demanded extensive scientific innovation and financial support. Development of new chemical entities and their transition from the laboratory to market required the company to expend as high as 800 million US dollars [1]. Apart from a huge investment, the development of the new drug was also an extensively time consuming process with very limited success rates.\u25a0Research progress in the drug discovery area resulted in the development of various poorly soluble drug candidates. The solubility limitations of these drug candidates, in turn, lead to poor bioavailability and lower therapeutic efficacy [2, 3]. In such situations, formulation of these therapeutic molecules into nanoparticulate delivery systems was observed to improve their bioavailability and hence elicit the desired therapeutic effects from these candidates. The nanoparticles also received a prominence due to other probable benefits like biodegradability, biocompatibility, high encapsulation characteristics and probability of surface functionalization [[1], [2], [3]].\u25a0Nanoparticles were found to exhibit several advantages for parenteral drug delivery; counter to the aggregation phenomenon commonly observed with microparticles, the smaller size of nanoparticles endowed them with better distribution profiles during systemic administration. Nanoparticles enabled an effective systemic circulation, thus leading to better therapeutic outcomes. Better systemic circulation was found to be specifically important for cancer therapies, where nanoparticles could infiltrate through the vasculature of tumor tissue and provide targeted therapeutic effects [4].\u25a0First pass metabolism is one of the key concerns for many commercial and upcoming drugs. This phenomenon accounts for their low bioavailability and reduced efficacy at the site of action. In this regard, nanoparticulate drug delivery vehicles were particularly advantageous because of their likelihood in being modulated for site specific delivery/ targeted delivery. Apart from their specificity, nanoparticles were also found to mitigate drug related side effects and dose related toxicities, resulting in enhanced bioavailability of the encapsulated agent and excellent patient compliance [1, 3, 5].\u25a0Owing to their small size, nanoparticles were found to effectively traverse many biological barriers. Of significant importance is their ability to permeate the blood brain barrier (BBB). Although brain administration is an effective route for the treatment of various brain diseases, it is severely limited due to the highly impermeable nature of the BBB. Because of their potential to cross this barrier, numerous publications have demonstrated the effectiveness of nanoparticles for targeting various central nervous system disorders [6]. Nanospectra Bioscience, Texas, USA, has recently initiated a clinical trial of nanoparticle based \u2018nanoshells\u2019 for the treatment of brain tumors [7].\u25a0The size of nanoparticles offers distinct advantages when compared with conventional dosage forms. The tunable size of these systems greatly influences the release profile of the encapsulated active component, so a formulator could thus control the drug release at the site of action [8, 9].\u25a0Nanoparticles were found to be highly versatile systems to encapsulate and delivery not only chemical drug moieties but also nuclic acid therapeutics (DNA, siRNA), and imaging and diagnostic agents, for site-specific delivery and detection. Various ligands can be attached to the surface of nanoparticles to guide them to specific locations within the body [9, 10].\n",

The solubility of drugs has been a concern for formulation scientists because of the difficulties in developing oral and parenteral delivery systems for poorly soluble drugs. Though the pharmaceutical sector is witnessing vast advances in drug discovery and its therapeutic horizon is expanding, it is the existing drug molecules and novel drug candidates that pose major solubility problems. Various reports indicate that approximately 40% of the drugs which are currently in the market have poor water solubility [11]. About one-third of the drug candidates in the pharmacopoeia exhibit the same solubility limitations. Low water solubility in turn hampers adequate absorption and hence leads to low therapeutic efficacy [12]. The solubility constraint of drugs and novel drug candidates is thus one of the major obstacles to the development of therapeutically effective drug delivery systems.",

They can be tailored to achieve both controlled drug release and disease-specific localization, either by tuning the material characteristics or by altering the surface chemistry [14]. It has been established that nanocarriers can become concentrated preferentially in the tumor mass, sites of inflammation, and at sites of infection by virtue of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of the vasculature. Once accumulated at the target site, hydrophobic biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles can act as a local drug depot, depending upon the make-up of the carrier, thus providing a reservoir for continuous supply of encapsulated therapeutic compound at the disease site, such as, a solid tumor. These systems, in general, can be used to provide targeted (cellular/tissue) delivery of drugs, to improve oral bioavailability, to sustain drug/gene effects in the target tissue, to solubilize drugs for intravascular delivery, or to improve the stability of therapeutic agents against enzymatic degradation (nucleases and proteases), this being especially relevant for protein, peptide, and nucleotide based agents [13, 15, 16]. Thus, the advantages of using nanoparticles for drug delivery result from two main basic properties: their small size and the use of biodegradable materials.",

A further advantage over conventional drug delivery systems is their better suitability for intravenous (i.v.) delivery. The smallest capillaries in the body are 5\u20136 \u03bcm in diameter. Therefore the size of particles being distributed into the bloodstream must be significantly smaller than 5 \u03bcm, without forming aggregates, to ensure that the particles do not lead to an embolism. Additionally, some types of cells permit the uptake of only sub-micron particles and not their larger counterparts. Generally nanoparticles have relatively higher intracellular uptake compared to microparticles and are available to a much wider range of biological targets due to their small size and relative mobility. Desai et al. found that 100 nm nanoparticles had a 2.5 fold greater uptake than 1 \u03bcm microparticles, and 6 fold greater uptake than 10 \u03bcm microparticles in a CaCo\u2013 2 cell line [16].

Emulsions with nanoscopic droplet sizes (typically in the range of 20\u2013200 nm) are often referred to as nanoemulsions [18]. Nanoemulsions offer enhanced solubilization capacity for poorly soluble drugs, increased drug loading, and in turn lead to a higher bioavailability of the formulated therapeutic moiety. Various GRAS (generally regarded as safe) approved, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and nonionic surfactants are commonly used for formulating the nanoemulsions. The formulation of nanoemulsions can either involve appropriate energy inputs (ultrasonication, high pressure homogenization, microfluidization) or may be a spontaneous process. There are a few commercial products like Estrasorb\u00ae and Flexogan\u00ae which are based on nanoemulsion technology [19, 20]. Estrasorb\u00ae is estradiol topical emulsion developed by Novavax and is recommended for the reduction of vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women. Estrasorb\u00ae is composed of soyabean oil, water, polysorbate 80 and water and is based on micellar nanoparticle technology. This technology proves that poorly water soluble molecules like estradiol can be successfully formulated and commercialized using nanoparticulate delivery vehicles [20, 21].",

The drug candidate in this product is fenofibrate, a lipophilic compound which is practically insoluble in water. The bioavailability of fenofibrate is severely limited due to its poor water solubility although clinical observations have revealed a higher bioavailability in fed-state patients. This has been attributed to the lipids and associated compounds in the meal which enhance its solubility and hence absorption [25]. In another study, micronization of fenofibrate was found to enhance its dissolution and hence its oral bioavailability. This study also confirmed the reason for nanocrystals of fenofibrate, with a still lower particle size, to further improve its bioavailability, when compared with the micronized form [26].",

Doxil\u00ae (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) was the first nanoparticulate product approved for targeted cancer therapy. Pegylated liposomes demonstrated improved pharmacokinetic and pharacodynamic profiles. Polyethyeleneglycol (PEG) coating thus constituted one of the first, commercial targeting strategies [43, 63]. It also afforded additional stability to the nanoparticles and prevented their elimination by reticuloendothilial system (RES). Tagging of PEG on nanoparticle surface, also known as \u2018steric stabilization\u2019 or \u2018stealth effect\u2019, was also reported to improve their blood circulation time and uptake by macrophages [43, 64].",

The receptor subsequently binds to caveolin-1 with successive formation of caveolae, a key determinant of transcellular endothelial permeability. Albumin is accumulated in breast, lung, head, neck and prostate cancer by binding with the secreted protein acid rich in cystein (SPARC). SPARC-albumin interaction supports the accumulation of albumin in tumor and increases the effectiveness of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel). The success of nab nanoparticles has paved a way for their use in different types of cancer, and a large number of clinical trials, utilizing these nanoparticles, are presently in progress [43, [67], [68], [69], [70]].",

The BBB consists of different cellular components, such as endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, and microglial cells, interconnected with each other by tight, impermeable junctions. In presence of these natural barriers, drug delivery to the CNS may be performed using invasive methods or non-invasive methods or their combinations. Invasive methods can generate various complications, and are thus adopted only in cases of fatal diseases. In the non-invasive category, nanoparticulate drug carriers have demonstrated great potential for successful therapies [74]. The surface modification of these systems allows them to be directed to specific receptors in the brain while their small size can be exploited for traversing the BBB. Additionally, nanoparticles also prevent structural modification of the drug and can deliver the drug to the desired site in its original form. Other properties of nanoparticles, like biodegradability, low particle size (\u2248 100 nm), prolonged circulation by surface modification, receptor medicated transcytosis, large-scale production ability, possibility for loading of drugs/peptides and the ability to control the release of encapsulated active agent, make them ideal for targeted drug delivery to the brain [[72], [73], [74], [75]].

            "text": "Literature reports describe the employment of nanoparticles for the colon targeted delivery of various encapsulated moieties. Zheng et al. [101] have reported the incorporation of Thymopentin, a potent immunomodulating drug, into pH-sensitive chitosan nanoparticles coated with Eudragit S100 (ES100) to improve the stability and the oral bioavailability of the encapsulated agent. Uniform nanoparticles with a size of about 175 nm and a moderately high encapsulation of around 76% were formulated. The nanoparticles were found to effectively protect the encapsulated moiety from enzymatic degradation and prolong its degradation half-time. Results of lymphocyte proliferation test and in vivo evaluation in rats demonstrated that the nanoparticles could be used as effective vectors for the oral delivery of Thymopentin. Wang et al. [102] have reported the development of Cyclosporine A (CyA) loaded pH-sensitive nanoparticles of ES 100. Various in vivo studies conducted by this research group revealed that the nanoparticles increased the absorption of CyA, which could be attributed to a fast stomach empting rate, site specific absorption and lower degradation rate of the entrapped moiety by the luminal contents and the high bioadhesion of nanoparticles to the intestine mucosa. The authors have claimed that the investigation could be helpful for the design of dosage forms for other peptide or protein drugs. Researchers have reported the efficiency of ES 100 nanoparticles as a favorable vehicle for the selective absorption of drugs in the gut, when administered by the oral route. This was proved by encapsulating Rhodamine 6G (Rho) as a model agent. The nanoparticles were evaluated for Rho release profiles, distribution, adhesion and transition in rat gut. It was observed that the nanoparticles decreased the distribution and adhesion of Rho in the stomach but increased these values in the intestine. Additionally, these nanocarriers were reported to control the drug release sites and release rate in the GI tract [103]. Scientists have also investigated the potential of ES 100 to improve oral delivery of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in dogs [104]. Incorporation of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor, HIV CGP 57813, into ES 100 nanoparticles was found to substantially increase the oral bioavailability of this compound after administration to dogs and achieve plasma levels comparable to those obtained in studies conducted in lower animals such as mice [105].",

Pulmonary market is expected to increase by up to $24.5 billion by 2015, with a CAGR of 2.8% [106]. There is a growing need for novel therapeutic systems for the treatment of respiratory disease like tuberculosis, pulmonary hypertension, cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Pulmonary route is also being increasingly exploited for the delivery of peptides and vaccines. In view of this enormous need, nanoparticles can provide the right therapeutic option for the treatment of variety of respiratory diseases [107]. Nanoparticle systems in targeted pulmonary drug delivery offers various advantages such as uniform distribution of drug in alveoli, bypassing of first pass metabolism, high solubility, sustained release property, reduced side effects, delivery of macromolecules and improved patient compliance. Lung targeting using nanoparticles can also be achieved through parenteral route. However, researchers have preferred the pulmonary route over the latter [108, 109]. A summary of various nanoparticulate carriers, intended for targeting the lung, has been presented in Table 1.5\n.",

Also notable is the number of conditions where they may be applied, via different administration routes, for better therapeutic outcomes. With persistence from both academia and industry, some of these systems have successfully accomplished the cumbersome transition from laboratories to clinics. In this book, we intend to provide an overview of these different therapeutic nanoparticles, the challenges encountered in their transition to clinical settings, the solutions which may be adopted for surmounting these challenges and the success stories of some of these drug delivery nanoparticles.",
