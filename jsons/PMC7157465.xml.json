The diagram of the course of acute virus infection (Figure 1\n) indicates the optimal methods for viral diagnosis. Following transmission, the virus starts to multiply and after an incubation period clinical symptoms appear with simultaneous shedding of infectious virus. The presence of infectious virus or viral structural components can be investigated directly from various clinical specimens either by nucleic acid detection assays, virus isolation, or antigen detection assays. Irrespective of the method of direct virus detection, specimens collected at the site of symptoms give the most conclusive diagnosis.",

Agarose gel electrophoresis combined with ethidium bromide staining of the products is a classical method (Figure 4\n). The size of the amplified product is compared to control amplicons and other standards in the same gel. Various hybridization assays, based on labeled complementary oligonucleotides (probes), are also used to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the detection. For applications with a large number of targets, such as respiratory virus detection or papillomavirus typing, conventional PCR with post-PCR hybridization is still a popular solution. Products of highly multiplexed PCR assays can be identified by probe hybridization on microarrays using scanning fluorometer or on fluorescent microbeads using flow-cytometric bead counting.",

Fluorescence is generated by a dsDNA dye or a fluorescent probe system included into the reaction mix. The earlier the amplification product becomes detectable over the background, the higher is the amount of virus in the sample (Figure 5\n). A dsDNA dye (e.g. SYBR Green I) reacts with any dsDNA formed during amplification, but amplicon specificity can be confirmed by melting curve analysis. It also allows testing for more than one virus from the same sample (Figure 6\n). There are many alternative probe chemistries for real-time PCR, the most common including dual label probes. Since probes are usually more selective for their target sequences than primers, probe based real-time PCR methods offer highest specificities with fastest reaction times. Multichannel instruments allow the use of probes with different exitation and emission spectra for the simultaneous detection of several different analytes in a single tube.",
