In the 1970s, growing recognition of this problem11 led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in its Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), to require blood from paid donors to be labeled as such.12 As these \u201cpaid donor\u201d-labeled units were considered to be undesirable by clinicians and hospitals, the practice of paid whole blood donations effectively died out.",

Although blood donor incentives such as t-shirts, gift certificates, and paid time off are acceptable gifts, rewards that can easily be converted to cash (or cash itself) are not. The issue of donor motivation caused by incentives continues to be an area of concern to the FDA and the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). The CFR, in its definition of paid and volunteer donors, states that \u201cBenefits, such as time off from work, membership in blood assurance programs, and cancellation of nonreplacement fees that are not readily convertible to cash, do not constitute payment within the meaning of this paragraph.\u201d The AABB18 and FDA19 have provided some guidance on donor incentives (Table 11-1\n). There is still a concern that a potential donor might be untruthful about high-risk behaviors for infectious disease to receive a gift being offered at a blood collection site. For this reason, incentives should be provided for simply attending a blood drive and attempting to donate, rather than the gift being given based on the condition of the actual donation.",

Under more routine circumstances, inhospitable conditions and/or poor customer service may almost certainly discourage a blood donor from making a donation. A safe and convenient location is critical to attract and retain repeat blood donors. Parking should be easily available and free. The waiting area should be clean and pleasant. Excessive waits are to be avoided, and donors should be given an accurate wait-time whenever possible. Blood center staff should be professional, knowledgeable, and courteous. Of particular importance is making sure that a new donor understands the donation process and fully knows what to expect. Donors appreciate honesty, and unpleasant or painful surprises often provoke bad feelings.",

Evidence presented by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) indicates that many transfusion services either do not test autologous blood for infectious disease markers or knowingly collect, store, and transfuse infectious units.39 Although transfusion of these infected units may not present an obvious risk to the donor/patient, accidental needlesticks and splatters do put blood handlers at risk. Accidental transfusion of an infected autologous unit to the wrong recipient is possible. Storage of infectious blood components in hospital blood banks also presents some risk to other patients, considering that at least 1 in every 25,000 blood products is transfused to the \u201cwrong\u201d individual.40 In 1992, the CAP conducted a survey of 3852 hospital transfusion services and found that 34 (0.9%) had issued one or more autologous blood products to the wrong patient during the previous year, and that 20 of these units were actually transfused.40 An analysis of 256 licensed transfusion services by The New York State Department of Health, from 1990 through 1998, indicated that 1 in 19,000 RBC units where transfused to the wrong patient or were of incorrect ABO group or Rh type.41 In addition, preliminary data indicate the frequency of infectious disease markers among autologous donors is significantly higher than that of allogeneic donors (Table 11-2\n). This data, along with the decreasing benefits of autologous transfusion due to improved infectious disease testing of allogeneic blood, make the practice of storing and transfusing infected units less attractive to hospital transfusion services.",

This situation may arise at an institutional blood drive or with directed donations for a friend or family member. The donor may deny risk factors, such as homosexuality or drug abuse, for fear that a breach of confidentiality might allow this behavior to become widely known. The confidential unit exclusion (CUE) provides the opportunity for a donor to request, with confidentiality guaranteed, that unacceptable donated blood not be used for transfusion. This procedure is accomplished by affording the donor a CUE card containing the unit number and a means of indicating, if necessary, that the unit not be used for transfusion. The CUE is then placed in a locked box to be reviewed at a later time, at which time excluded units are earmarked for destruction. In addition, centers can provide a designated telephone number so that a donor can call back with additional information, when necessary, that would exclude a unit for transfusion. When first used, the infectious disease marker frequency of units designated for nonuse by CUE was significantly higher than other units: as many as 20% of anti-HIV positive units would have been diverted from transfusion due to the CUE.80 Improved donor education, infectious disease testing, and screening techniques have made the CUE a less valuable tool.81, 82, 83 Many CUEs are the result of donors misunderstanding the CUE directions and inadvertently checking the wrong box.84,\n85 For this reason, after investigation, some centers will destroy an excluded unit but will continue to allow the donor to donate blood.86\n",

The density of granulocytes is only slightly lower than that of RBCs, which makes it difficult to produce a clean separation. RBCs in the granulocyte product must be compatible with the recipient to avoid the possibility of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. To help remedy the problem of red cell contamination, differential sedimentation is enhanced by use of rouleaux-inducing agents. Both hetastarch and pentastarch are employed for this purpose, although hetastarch is more widely used for its higher granulocyte yields.103 Hetastarch, however, is less rapidly cleared from the body and accumulates more readily in the extravascular space, which can lead to localized edema, headache, and fluid retention in repeat donors, often family members, who donate regularly over a period of several days. It may be wise to use reduced dosages for frequent donors to help avoid these effects. These adverse effects tend to be less of a problem for infrequent donors and with collections using pentastarch. Although traces of hetastarch may be detected in the donor for years, there has been no demonstrated clinical significance. Combined premedication with G-CSF, dexamethasone, and collection with the use of hetastarch have been reported to provide a product with a granulocyte yield of 4.1 to 10.8 \u00d7 1010 compared to 2.1 to 2.6 \u00d7 1010 using dexamethasone alone.104\n",

Hospital-based donor rooms may have access to an emergency response team with a crash cart to deal with these situations. For remote centers without an on-site emergency response team, it may be prudent to call paramedics and have the donor transferred to a local emergency room if necessary. Maintaining a crash cart in the donor center with emergency life support equipment and medications is controversial. Centers that rarely see a severe reaction may have little or no actual experience with advanced life support procedures despite formal accreditation and may be unfamiliar with the available emergency equipment when needed. It may be better to have an emergency backup system, often calling 911, than to have an crash cart and not know how to use it.",

Safety issues have come under increasing regulatory surveillance, and there is particular concern about accidental exposure through used needles, lancets, and microhematocrit tubes.147 Retractable needle covers to avoid accidental needlesticks have become mandatory in some states. Safety devices are also available for filling pilot tubes. Disposable lancets and glass microhematocrit tubes can puncture skin if not handled properly. Proper disposal of used needles, lancets, and microcapillary hematocrit tubes in specialized \u201csharps\u201d containers is mandatory. A properly designed and enforced Exposure Control Plan is a key element in preventing occupational blood exposures and transmission of bloodborne pathogens.",
