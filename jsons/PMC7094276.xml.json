Each lung was divided into three zones (upper, middle, and lower) on frontal radiography. The observers assessed the presence, appearances (airspace opacities or reticular opacities), distribution, and size of lung parenchymal abnormalities on each CXR of all patients. The size of the lesion was assessed by visually estimating the percentage of area occupied in each zone on each side. The overall percentage of involvement was obtained by averaging the percentage of involvement of the six lung zones. The frontal CXR closest to the date of the lung function test was assessed by two radiologists, both of whom were blinded to the clinical information. The findings were reached by consensus. The assessment method was described in our previous study.33\n",

Several studies45\n46\n47 on ARDS survivors have shown that their pulmonary function generally returns to normal or near normal by 6 to 12 months, but Dlco may remain abnormal in up to 80% of patients at 1 year after recovery.14 The decreasing trend for Va, discordant with TLC, observed in our study suggests there might be maldistribution of the inert gas during the single-breath Dlco maneuver, such as in the setting of occult small airway obstruction in some patients. Although expiratory HRCT was not performed in adult patients,42\n43 a pediatric study48 of 47 asymptomatic children at 6 months from diagnosis of SARS showed that 16 patients (34%) had pulmonary abnormalities, whereas 8 patients (17%) had evidence of air trapping on expiratory HRCT.",

Previous studies12\n49 have shown that 6MWD was substantially lower among ARDS survivors than control subjects 1 to 2 years after mechanical ventilation, whereas the absence of systemic steroid treatment, absence of illness acquired during ICU stay, and rapid resolution of lung injury were important factors associated with a longer 6MWD at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively.12 After controlling for the known effects of age and gender, our analysis has shown that percentage of predicted FVC was the positive independent factor associated with higher 6MWD at 6 months, whereas percentage of predicted FVC and percentage of predicted Dlco were the positive independent predictors at 12 months.",

Eighteen of 44 SARS survivors in Singapore had reduced exercise capacity at 3 months after hospital discharge that could not be accounted for by impairment of pulmonary function.52 These results suggest that the inability to exercise in recovered SARS patients is primarily due to extrapulmonary causes such as physical deconditioning and possibly steroid myopathy.51\n52 In addition, 53% of SARS survivors complained of some degree of large-joint pain, although only 12 patients (4.7%, including 7 patients in the current study) of 254 SARS survivors in our cluster of hospitals had evidence of osteonecrosis of the long bones on MRI conducted at a median of 6.7 months from hospital admission.53\n",

The long period of bed rest could lead to muscle wasting and deconditioning, whereas the use of systemic corticosteroid therapy to suppress immune-mediated lung injury4\n7\n8\n9\n19 could contribute to myopathy. Steroid myopathy has been reported in patients administered high-dose steroid for acute lung transplant rejection54 and status asthmaticus.55 Critical illness-associated polyneuropathy/myopathy has also been observed in SARS survivors.56 A small proportion of our SARS patients had evidence of respiratory muscle weakness.

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. Firstly, we did not perform cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), as many patients complained of generalized muscle weakness on initial follow-up. CPET would also be too labor-intensive for a large cohort of SARS survivors. Nevertheless, reduced pulmonary gas exchange has been detected with CPET in some survivors of SARS at 3 months with normal Dlco.52 Secondly, only 97 of 123 survivors (79%) in the cohort had completed the serial assessments over 12 months, and the results might not be representative of the entire cohort. Thirdly, we assessed respiratory muscle strength with mouth pressure, but low Pemax values do not always indicate expiratory muscle weakness and might result from technical difficulties such as mouth leakage. Lastly, we could not measure the effects of extrapulmonary factors (such as muscle deconditioning, steroid or viral-induced myopathy, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, critical illness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy) in the poor performance of the 6MWT. It is difficult to determine the contribution by psychological and motivational factors, as many patients are seeking compensation for occupation-related SARS.",

The functional disability appears to be out of proportion to the degree of lung function impairment and may be due to additional factors such as muscle deconditioning, steroid-related musculoskeletal complications, critical illness-related neuropathy/myopathy, and other psychological factors. Further follow-up is needed to assess if these deficits are persistent.",
