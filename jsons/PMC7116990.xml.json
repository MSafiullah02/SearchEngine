            "text": "The autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) model proposed by Engle (1982) has led to considerable interest in models in which the conditional variance (volatility) of the current observation, \u03c3t2, is a function of the past observations. Engle's ARCH model formulated the conditional variance of the process as \u201clinear\u201d in squared past values. Bollerslev (1986) generalized ARCH model to allow the conditional variance to depend additionally on its past realizations. Since then many empirical and theoretical aspects of the ARCH/GARCH model have been developed. Shepard (1996) and Rydberg (2000) gave excellent surveys of ARCH/GARCH modelling for financial data. Weiss (1986) and Berkes et al. (2003) established consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators for ARCH and GARCH model, respectively. The former assumes that the errors have finite fourth moment and the latter requires a moment of errors slightly higher than the fourth. Hall and Yao (2003) showed that when the error is heavy tailed (without finite fourth moment), quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) are not asymptotically normal and suffer from slow convergence rate and complex asymptotic distribution, which do not facilitate, among others, statistical tests and interval estimation in the standard manner; see Hall and Yao (2003), and Mikosch and Straumann (2006). Peng and Yao (2003) pointed out that a kind of least absolute deviations estimator (LADE) has asymptotic normality if the error distribution has finite second moment.",

Among all the extensions, the functional form for \u03c3t2 is of great importance (see Higgins and Bera, 1992). Even Engle (1982) has acknowledged that \u201cit is likely that other formulations of the variance may be more appropriate for the particular applications\u201d. Hsieh (1989) found that the GARCH models cannot fit some exchange rates satisfactorily; Scheinkman and LeBaron (1989) found evidence that volatility in stock market data cannot be captured completely by linear ARCH models; Gouri\u00e9roux (1997, p. 90) indicated that the heteroscedasticity varies depending on whether the error is positive or negative. This leads to asymmetric threshold ARCH modelling. The study of Li and Li (1996) has showed that threshold-asymmetric modelling provides better fitting compared with symmetric ARCH in the field of financial time series. Therefore, combining the above ideas, Hwang and Kim (2004) proposed a broad class of power-transformed and threshold ARCH model:(1.1)Xt=\u03c3t\u03b5tand\u03c3t2\u03b4=\u03b10+\u2211i=1p\u03b11i(Xt-i+)2\u03b4+\u2211i=1p\u03b12i(Xt-i-)2\u03b4,where \u03b4>0, \u03b10>0, \u03b11i\u2a7e0, \u03b12i\u2a7e0 are unknown parameters, i=1,\u2026,p. Here, {\u03b5t} is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, and \u03b5t is independent of {Xt-k,k\u2a7e1} for all t. They studied the geometric ergodicity and existence of moments of the model, and investigated a large sample test for ARCH structures based on the uniform local asymptotic normality approach. However, the \u03c3t in Hwang and Kim's (2004) model is only a function of the past p observations. Hwang and Basawa (2004) introduced a Box\u2013Cox transformed threshold GARCH(1,1) model by allowing \u03c3t to depend on \u03c3t-1 and studied the stationarity and moment structure of the model. Liu (2006) investigated the tail behavior of the Box\u2013Cox transformed threshold GARCH(1,1) model.",

A simulation study indicates that the LADE is more accurate than the QMLE when the errors are heavy-tailed. We give a real data example to illustrate the practicality of our theory.

Then we test p=1, q=1 vs p=1, q=0, and the Wald statistic is 34.9, which rejects the null hypothesis and we take p=1, q=1. The LADEs are (\u03b4^,\u03b1^0,\u03b1^11,\u03b1^21,\u03b2^)=(0.5384,0.0495,0.0189,0.0899,0.8642)with standard errors 0.0524, 0.0123, 0.0296, 0.0571, and 0.0464, respectively. To check the adequacy of the estimated PTTGARCH(1,1) model, we conduct the white noise test for the residuals and the squared residuals using the same method as for Xt before. We have Wn(8)=2.60 and Wn(12)=3.41 for the residuals and Wn2(8)=11.99 and Wn2(12)=17.46 for the squared residuals, which are all not significant at 0.05 level. Hence, the estimated PTTGARCH(1,1) model is adequate for the data {Xt}. Notice that for both the residuals and the squared residuals, all the Wald statistics based on LADE are less than those based on QMLE, which suggests that the fitted model based on LADE is the more adequate. For the fitted model using LADE, we also test the hypotheses \u03b4=1 and \u03b111=\u03b121, respectively. The Wald statistic for the former is 14.24 and is highly significant. The Wald statistic for the latter is 2.41 and is not significant, which may be caused by the small values of \u03b111 and \u03b121. In fact, as we can see from the estimators, \u03b1^21 is about five times \u03b1^11. This example illustrates that the data are asymmetric and nonlinear and the PTTGARCH model is capable of capturing these characteristics.",

Thus, \u03c6\u00afn\u2192a.s.\u03c60.(ii) By the mean value theorem, we obtain that \u2202Ln(\u03c6\u00afn)\u2202\u03c6=\u2202Ln(\u03c60)\u2202\u03c6+\u22022Ln(\u03be)\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6\u2032(\u03c6\u00afn-\u03c60),where \u03be lies between \u03c60 and \u03c6\u00afn. But, \u2202Ln(\u03c6\u00afn)/\u2202\u03c6=0. Then \u22022Ln(\u03be)\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6\u2032(\u03c6\u00afn-\u03c60)=-\u2202Ln(\u03c60)\u2202\u03c6.Using Lemma 3 and the continuity of \u22022Ln(\u03c6)/\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6\u2032, we obtain (\u039b0+o(1))(\u03c6\u00afn-\u03c60)=-1n\u2202Ln(\u03c60)\u2202\u03c6.It can be easily verified that \u2202lt(\u03c60)\u2202\u03c6=12(1-\u03b5t2)1\u03c3t2(\u03c60)\u2202\u03c3t2(\u03c60)\u2202\u03c6is a stationary sequence of martingale differences. Therefore, by applying a central limit theorem of martingale (Hall and Heyde, 1980), we obtain n(\u03c6\u00afn-\u03c60)\u2192LN(0,\u039b0-1\u03a90\u039b0-1).\u25a1\n\nProof of Theorem 2(i) By Lemmas 5, and 6, we have sup\u03c6\u2208\u03981nL\u02dcn(\u03c6)-L(\u03c6)\u2a7dsup\u03c6\u2208\u03981nLn(\u03c6)-1nL\u02dcn(\u03c6)+sup\u03c6\u2208\u03981nLn(\u03c6)-L(\u03c6)\u2192a.s.0.Imitating the proof of Theorem 1 (i), we obtain the result.(ii) Notice that1n\u2202Ln(\u03c6\u00afn)\u2202\u03c6-1n\u2202Ln(\u03c6\u02dcn)\u2202\u03c6=1n\u2202Ln(\u03c6\u00afn)\u2202\u03c6-1n\u2202L\u02dcn(\u03c6\u02dcn)\u2202\u03c6+1n\u2202L\u02dcn(\u03c6\u02dcn)\u2202\u03c6-1n\u2202Ln(\u03c6\u02dcn)\u2202\u03c6.From Lemma 5 and the mean value theorem, we have 1n\u22022Ln(\u03be*)\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6\u2032n(\u03c6\u02dcn-\u03c6\u00afn)\u27f6a.s.0.Thus, n(\u03c6\u02dcn-\u03c6\u00afn)=o(1) by Lemma 3 and the continuity of \u22022Ln(\u03c6)/\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6\u2032. Then the result follows from Theorem 1.(iii) By Lemmas 3 and 6 and Theorem 2 (ii), we have Esup\u03c6\u2208\u0398|\u039b\u02dc(\u03c6)-\u039b(\u03c6)|\u2192a.s.0,and[\u039b(\u03c6\u02dcn)-\u039b(\u03c60)]=Op(1)(\u03c6\u02dcn-\u03c60)\u21920.Therefore, \u039b\u02dc(\u03c6\u02dcn)=[\u039b\u02dc(\u03c6\u02dcn)-\u039b(\u03c6\u02dcn)]+[\u039b(\u03c6\u02dcn)-\u039b(\u03c60)]+\u039b(\u03c60)\u2192\u039b0.by applying an ergodic theorem to \u039b(\u03c60). This completes the proof of Theorem 2. \u25a1\nProof of Theorem 3DefineTn(v)=\u2211t=un(|Qt(\u03c60+n-1/2v)|-|Qt(\u03c60)|),Tn*(v)=\u2211t=un(|Qt(\u03c60)-n-1/2v\u2032Dt|-|Qt(\u03c60)|),where Dt\u2261Dt(\u03c60). By Lemma 1 and the same argument as Lemma 6, we obtain that(5.9)Tn(v)-T\u02dcn(v)\u27f6P0,uniformly on compact sets. Using the equality(5.10)|z-y|-|z|=-ysgn(z)+2(y-z){I(0<z<y)-I(y<z<0)},z\u22600,we haveTn*(v)=n-1/2\u2211t=unv\u2032Dtsgn(Qt(\u03c60))+2\u2211t=un(n-1/2v\u2032Dt-Qt(\u03c60))[I(0<Qt(\u03c60)<n-1/2v\u2032Dt)-I(n-1/2v\u2032Dt<Qt(\u03c60)<0)]\u2254An+Bn.Since Qt(\u03c60)=log|\u03b5t|, we know {v\u2032Dtsgn(log|\u03b5t|)} is a stationary sequence of martingale differences by assumption (A4) and Lemma 2. Therefore, applying a martingale central limit theorem (Hall and Heyde, 1980), we obtain An\u2192Lv\u2032N, where N denotes a N(0,\u03a3) random vector.Now turning to Bn, let Unt=(n-1/2v\u2032Dt-log|\u03b5t|)I(0<log|\u03b5t|<n-1/2v\u2032Dt).ThennEUnt2=nE(E(Unt2|Ft-1))=nE\u222b0n-1/2v\u2032Dt(n-1/2v\u2032Dt-x)2f(x)dx=nE\u222b0n-1/2v\u2032Dt(n-1/2v\u2032Dt-x)2(f(x)-f(0))dx+\u222b0n-1/2v\u2032Dt(n-1/2v\u2032Dt-x)2f(0)dx\u2a7dE(B2n-2(v\u2032Dt)4+B1n-3/2(v\u2032Dt)3).By Lemma 2, we have E(v\u2032Dt)4<\u221e and E(v\u2032Dt)3<\u221e. Therefore, we have proved that(5.11)limsupn\u2192\u221enEUnt2=0.\nOn the other hand, on the set {Dt\u2032v>0}, we may show that \u2211t=unE(Unt|Ft-1)\u2192f(0)2E[(v\u2032Dt)2I(v\u2032Dt>0)]and Var\u2211t=un(Unt-E(Unt|Ft-1))\u21920.Therefore, \u2211t=unUnt\u2192f(0)2E[(v\u2032Dt)2I(v\u2032Dt>0)].Using the same argument for the second indicator in the summands of Bn, we obtain that(5.12)Bn\u2192Pf(0)v\u2032\u03a3v.Let T=f(0)v\u2032\u03a3v+v\u2032N, then the finite dimensional distributions of Tn* converge to those of T. But, since Tn* has convex sample paths, this implies that the convergence is in fact on C(Rd) (see the proof of Proposition 1 in Davis and Dunsmuir, 1997).Denote Ht(\u03c6)=\u22022Qt(\u03c6)/\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6\u2032, then we have E\u2225sup\u03c6\u2208\u0398Ht(\u03c6)\u2225<\u221e from Lemma 2. By Taylor expansion and (5.10), it follows thatTn(v)-Tn*(v)=\u2211t=un[|Qt(\u03c60)-n-1/2v\u2032Dt-n-1v\u2032Ht(\u03c6*)v|-|Qt(\u03c60)-n-1/2v\u2032Dt|]=-\u2211t=unn-1v\u2032Ht(\u03c6*)vsgn(log|\u03b5t|-n-1/2v\u2032Dt)+2\u2211t=un(n-1v\u2032Ht(\u03c6*)v-log|\u03b5t|+n-1/2v\u2032Dt)I(0<log|\u03b5t|-n-1/2v\u2032Dt<n-1v\u2032Ht(\u03c6*)v)+2\u2211t=un(n-1v\u2032Ht(\u03c6*)v-log|\u03b5t|+n-1/2v\u2032Dt)I(n-1v\u2032Ht(\u03c6*)v<log|\u03b5t|-n-1/2v\u2032Dt<0).By a similar argument for Sn**(v)-Sn*(v)\u21920 in Pan et al. (2007), we can obtain that Tn(v)-Tn*(v)\u2192P0 uniformly on compact sets, which implies T\u02dcn(v)\u2192LT on C(Rd) from (5.9). By the proof of Theorem 1 in Pan et al. (2007), we obtain the result. \u25a1\nProof of Theorem 4Based on Theorems 3 and 4 follows immediately from the following two assertions:(5.13)\u03a3^\u2192P\u03a3andf^(0)\u2192Pf(0).For the first assertion, defining \u03a3n(\u03c6)=1n\u2211t=1nDt(\u03c6)Dt(\u03c6)\u2032and\u03a3\u02dcn(\u03c6)=1n\u2211t=1nD\u02dct(\u03c6)D\u02dct(\u03c6)\u2032,we have \u03a3^=[\u03a3\u02dcn(\u03c6^n)-\u03a3\u02dcn(\u03c60)]+[\u03a3\u02dcn(\u03c60)-\u03a3n(\u03c60)]+\u03a3n(\u03c60)=:\u03a31n+\u03a32n+\u03a33n.Obviously, \u03a33n\u2192a.s.\u03a3 by the ergodic theorem.

Notice that|f*(0)-f(0)|\u2a7d1nbn\u2211t=1nK1bnlog|Xt|\u03c3t(\u03c6n^)-Klog|\u03b5t|bn|+|1nbn\u2211t=1nKlog|\u03b5t|bn-f(0)=L1+L2.It follows from Lemma 2 and Theorem 3 thatL1\u2a7dCnbn2\u2211t=1n|log\u03c3t2(\u03c6^)-log\u03c3t2(\u03c60)|=Cnbn2\u2225\u03c6n^-\u03c60\u2225\u2211t=1n1\u03c3t2(\u03c6*)\u2202\u03c3t2(\u03c6*)\u2202\u03c6=Cnbn2n\u2225\u03c6n^-\u03c60\u2225\u00b71n\u2211t=1n1\u03c3t2(\u03c6*)\u2202\u03c3t2(\u03c6*)\u2202\u03c6=O(1)1nbn2\u21920.\nOn the other hand, sinceE1bnKlog|\u03b5t|bn=\u222b-\u221e\u221eK(x)f(bnx)dx=\u222b-\u221e\u221eK(x)f(0)dx+\u222b-\u221e\u221eK(x)[f(bnx)-f(0)]dx=f(0)+op(1),it follows thatE(K2)2=1n2\u2211t=1nE1bnKlog|\u03b5t|bn-f(0)2+2n2\u22111\u2a7di<j\u2a7dnE1bnKlog|\u03b5i|bn-f(0)1bnKlog|\u03b5j|bn-f(0)\u2a7d2nbn\u222b-\u221e\u221eK2(x)f(bnx)dx+2nf2(0)+2n2\u22111\u2a7di<j\u2a7dnE1bnKlog|\u03b5i|bn-f(0)E1bnKlog|\u03b5j|bn-f(0)\u27f60by assumption (A4). Then, K2\u2192P0. This completes the proof of the second assertion. \u25a1\n",
