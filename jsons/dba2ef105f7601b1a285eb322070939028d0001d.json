This might contribute to the dramatically higher number of infected cases than the two other coronaviruses related diseases. As the time and chance of infection exposure to susceptible people within household model were more than that in community and population-level, the transmission probability in household may be stronger than that in community and population-level in most case [8, 10, 11] .

In this report, the results showed secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 to adults was dramatically higher than that to children which might reflect the different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 between children and adults and indicate adults were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than children who aged below 18 years when they exposed themselves to the same sources of infection. This is similar with SARS virus that infected most peoples aged above 18 years. However, the real causes leading to the different secondary attack rates between adult and children needed to be more explored and many factors could influence the secondary transmission of epidemic diseases in household, such as behaviors of contacts and occupations of members [10] .",
