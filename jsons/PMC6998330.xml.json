            "text": "Survivors of critical illness have severe long-term functional disability [1]. Following the intensive care unit (ICU) stay, the quality of life and return to pre-ICU admission daily activities are impaired [1\u20133]. Both diaphragm and limb muscles are affected [1, 4\u20137]. Limb muscle weakness is one of the greatest issues linked with disability and poor outcomes in survivors [1, 8\u201311]. Diaphragm weakness has also been associated with poor outcome such as dependency on mechanical ventilation, prolonged ICU length of stay and mortality [4, 12\u201314]. Muscle weakness is related to muscle mass but beyond mass, loss of muscle function and muscle quality without atrophy has been observed in the elderly and in chronic hemodialysis patient populations, [15, 16] a condition labeled as dynapenia. At the ICU bedside, ultrasonography (US) is an inexpensive, user-friendly, non-volitional and non-invasive tool widely used by intensivists. US has been suggested to be a reliable tool to approximate muscle mass by measuring the cross-sectional area and muscle thickness [7, 17] and to also approximate muscle quality by grey-scale analysis of the muscle echogenicity [18, 19]. However, subcutaneous tissue and muscle edema and inflammation, frequently observed in the critically ill, can make the grey-scale analysis difficult to interpret. Moreover, diaphragm contractions during spontaneous breathing and passive stretch during mechanical ventilation may also make ultrasonography more difficult to perform in the critically ill patients than in healthy controls able to block their breathing cycle.",

By using inversion algorithms, this method maps the waves into elastograms and determines stiffness of the tissue by measuring the shear modulus value [20]. SWE has been established as an excellent diagnostic method for liver fibrosis, breast cancer and thyroid cancer [21]. In skeletal muscles, it provides a spatial representation and quantifiable measurement of the mechanical properties and an approximate of the muscle fibrosis and the activity of the disease in chronic myopathy [22] as well as a surrogate of diaphragm force production in healthy volunteers during isovolumetric inspiratory efforts [23]. Although SWE muscle analysis may provide new data about muscle quality during critical illness, it has never been evaluated in the very specific critically ill population which is exposed to severe structural muscular alterations. We therefore designed the present study with the aim of determining the reliability and reproducibility of SWE measurements for limb muscles and the diaphragm in both healthy subjects and in critically ill patients.",

For mechanically ventilated patients, an end-expiratory pause was applied during SWE acquisition and the absence of diaphragm contraction was assessed using ventilator curves and ultrasound real-time images. The absence of movements and limb muscle contraction was also clinically carefully checked in the critically ill patients. We collected all measurements in triplicate, from the three muscles on the right side and at a resting position: diaphragm, biceps brachii and the rectus femoris.

Transmission of a longitudinal pulse leads to tissue displacement, which is detected by pulse echo ultrasound and allow the measurement of the shear wave velocity [V in m s\u22121]. The shear wave velocity V is proportional to the shear modulus (\u03bc expressed in kPa) using the formula: \u03bc = \u03c1.v2 (where \u03c1 is the tissue density, equals to 1000 kg m3 in the human body). Hard tissues have a higher \u03bc and v than soft ones. We performed the measurements at the middle portion of each muscle belly avoiding tendons, aponeurosis and fascial tissues to avoid measurement biases. When activating the SWE mode, a color-coded box representing the region of interest was super-imposed on the image (Fig. 2). SWE images were continuously acquired at a sampling rate of 2 Hz during apnea at the end of expiration for healthy subjects, or during an end-expiratory pause for mechanically ventilated patients. An elastography real-time 3-s cine loop was stored. We then offline manually drew the widest region of interest possible (labeled as a \u201cQ-box Trace\u201d) in a homogenous frozen image to average the shear modulus measurement into the drawn Q-box and to carefully exclude the surroundings tissue from the measurement.",

US evaluation of critically ill patients at the bedside has been largely adopted by intensivists because it is easily available, non-expensive and non-invasive and it can be used as a monitoring tool during the ICU stay. Therefore, besides its large indications in cardiovascular or respiratory management, it has also often been described to evaluate limb muscle and diaphragm mass in weak patients during the ICU stay [7, 28\u201332]. Very few US studies have however focused on parameters that reflect muscle quality. In a landmark study, Puthucheary et al. used grey-scaling of the rectus femoris images in 30 critically ill patients and reported that rectus femoris echogenicity variation could predict myonecrosis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 (95%CI, 0.565 to 0.919). Parry et al. reported in 22 critically ill patients that changes in vastus intermedius but not rectus femoris echogenicity over time were correlated with physical function tests collected at ICU awakening and at ICU discharge [28]. Beyond quantitative analysis of the muscle mass, non-invasive tools are urgently needed to provide measurable parameters of limb and respiratory muscle quality. Real-time non-volitional tools, available at the bedside such as SWE, would provide targets for clinical trials aiming at improving quality of life and autonomy in survivors of critical illness [33]. Because different pathologic and healthy tissues reveal a similar echogenicity pattern and similar grey-scale but different shear modulus values, sonoelastographic techniques such as SWE measurement might be a promising tool to evaluate and to monitor muscle quality and in vivo contractile property changes over time [27, 34]. For instance, high shear modulus is associated with muscle stiffness in cerebral palsy or in late Duchenne\u2019s myopathy [35], while low shear modulus is associated with atrophy in a GNE chronic myopathy [22]. Moreover, shear modulus but not echogenicity is associated with muscle fibrosis. No study has ever been performed to evaluate shear modulus measurement feasibility and reliability in the critically ill population at high risk of muscle edema.",

            "text": "In the present study, we explored both the limb muscles and the diaphragm, the main inspiratory muscle. Nowadays, since specific phrenic nerve stimulation tools to explore critical illness-associated diaphragm weakness are not routinely available at the bedside [4, 12] (and diaphragmatic biopsies are very difficult to obtain in humans [5, 39, 40]), non-invasive tools to explore the diaphragm using US is more and more popular. US may help by approximating diaphragm mass by measuring thickness as well as approximating diaphragm contractile activity by measuring the excursion and the thickening fraction [41]. A pioneer study by Goligher has reported that during critical illness and mechanical ventilation, the diaphragm thickness may decrease (supposedly because of atrophy), but may not change during the stay or may increase (supposedly because of myotrauma) [30, 42]. Since diaphragmatic shear modulus has been associated with diaphragmatic function in spontaneously breathing volunteers [43], shear modulus analysis of the diaphragm in the critically ill may pave the way towards a non-invasive better understanding of diaphragm quality changes during critical illness. Our study presents limits that should be discussed. First, we did not perform muscle biopsies to correlate shear modulus to pathology. However, most of the studies that have evaluated SWE in muscles did not show pathology data either [27, 34]. Second, precautions must be taken into consideration when shear modulus is measured. Position of the patient, muscle contraction and pressure applied to the muscle by the probe do indeed influence the shear modulus value [27, 34, 44]. We therefore took extreme precautions to limit any measurement bias and used an excessive amount of gel, did not apply any pressure to the muscle during the evaluation and used triplicates to calculate the mean shear modulus. We also paid extra attention to measure the shear modulus in muscles with no contractions and at the end of the expiration for the diaphragm. In the healthy controls, we report a diaphragm shear modulus above the range observed by Bachasson et al. [23]. Two main differences should be noted between the two studies. We performed the measurements in the supine position rather than the semi-recumbent position which may have impaired the diaphragm to completely relax at the end of the expiration. We designed the present study as a real-life bedside study and did not use a pneumotachograph or a transdiaphragmatic pressure monitoring. Therefore, even after taking extra precautions to measure the shear modulus at the end of expiration with no diaphragm contraction, it is possible that some of the measurements were performed above the functional residual capacity. However, because both intra-operator reliability and inter-operator reproducibility ICC were very high, our results suggest that shear wave elastography is a feasible technique to describe diaphragm ultrastructure. Diaphragm biopsies using critically ill animal models may help assessing the accuracy of the shear wave elastography technique in phenotyping diaphragm weakness. To limit the influence of muscle anisotropy on the measured value, we chose to use a large square as the region of interest to measure the signal. Third, we used shear modulus measurement rather than shear wave velocity. All commercially available US elastography systems are based on the prerequisite assumption that the material is elastic, incompressible, homogenous and isotropic, with a density which equals 1 g/cm3. The muscle tissue is however anisotropic and shear modulus should therefore be used as a variation during the course of the disease.",
