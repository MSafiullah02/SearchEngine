As another example, MNP (Fe3O4, \u224820 nm) coupled with a Salmonella typhimurium\u2010specific aptamer through adsorption was utilized to successfully detect S. typhimurium (Figure 1B).49 Here, MNP served as a peroxidase\u2010like NM converting TMB (colorless) to oxidized TMB (blue).50, 51 Single\u2010stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers with negatively charged phosphate backbone were adsorbed on the surface of positively charged MNP, without any surface modification. Adsorbed aptamers were detached from MNP and bound to the target pathogen, exposing the surface of MNP to H2O2. Exposed MNP then generates the OH\u2022 radical, which converts TMB to oxidized TMB, making a colorless\u2010to\u2010blue change upon pathogen presence. This method requires several steps: binding of specific ssDNA aptamers desorbed from the MNP\u2013aptamer complex to the corresponding pathogenic cells in the reaction solution, removal of the reaction solution containing pathogen\u2013aptamers with the MNPs being held by a magnet, and then addition of a colorimetric detection mixture (H2O2 and TMB) to induce a color change (Figure 1B). This method is advantageous as only a small amount of the colorimetric detection mixture is needed for a visible and clear color change, and there is no need for surface modification on MNPs for attaching ssDNA aptamers. However, it is compromised by the inconvenience of multiple steps as described above. When the mechanism of peroxidase activity of MNP is better understood through further studies, MNPs as a colorimetric sensing platform will find various applications in diagnostics.",

In particular, CNTs and graphene have received much attention for biosensor applications due to their outstanding electrical properties, based on high surface area and great electron mobility.52 When hybridized with other NMs, the high conductivity of CNTs and graphene significantly enhances catalytic activity.53, 54 Among various NMs, Au NPs are one of the most widely used NMs hybridized with CNTs or graphene due to their unique optical properties and peroxidase\u2010mimicking activities.55 The use of CNT or graphene hybridized with Au NPs showed further improved colorimetric\u2010sensing performance. For example, sensitive detection of influenza A (H3N2) virus was possible using CNT\u2013Au NP nanohybrid conjugated with influenza A (H3N2) hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibodies. (Figure 1C).56 The limit of detection (LOD) of the CNT\u2013Au NP nanohybrid system was 3.4 plaque\u2010forming units (PFU) per mL, which was several hundred times more sensitive than conventional enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay. In another example, norovirus in human serum could be sensitively detected by enhanced peroxidase\u2010like activity of a graphene\u2013Au NP nanohybrid (Figure 1C).57 The LOD of the graphene\u2013Au NP nanohybrid system was as low as 92.7 pg mL\u22121, which was 41 times lower than that could be detected with commercialized norovirus\u2010detection kits. Most studies employing nanohybrids for colorimetric diagnostics have so far been limited to utilizing Au NPs. Thus, it will be desirable to investigate other NMs having different properties in making nanohybrids with CNT and graphene so that new nanohybrid\u2010based colorimetric diagnostic systems having improved catalytic activities and consequently enhanced sensing performance can be developed for the efficient detection of even more diverse pathogenic bacteria and viruses.",

This visual color change upon the aggregation of NMs provides an easy and practical platform for the colorimetric detection of pathogenic bacteria and viruses (Figure\n\n2\nA). Among the various NMs, Au and Ag NMs have been most widely used in aggregation\u2010based colorimetric assays. Stabilized solutions of Au NPs and Ag NPs exhibit red and yellow colors, respectively, which are changed to blue (or purple) and red, respectively, upon their aggregation.

For example, pathogen\u2010specific antibodies and proteins have been conjugated on the surface of Au NPs.43 An antibody\u2013antigen binding induces aggregation of Au NP around the pathogens, which generates a colorimetric response.43, 59 To conjugate proteins on the surface of Au NPs, surface modification of the Au NPs is performed, for example, with N\u2010hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), which can interact with the amine groups in antibodies and proteins.59, 60, 61 Also, Au NPs functionalized with a virus\u2010specific polysaccharide (glycan) have been developed for detecting avian\u2010adapted influenza (vieH5N1) virus and human\u2010adapted influenza (shaH1N1) virus.62 However, steric hindrance of bulky bioreceptors limits the amount of bioreceptors (e.g., low bioreceptor concentration) that can be conjugated onto NMs, which hampers sensitive colorimetric detection. To overcome this limitation, several attempts have been made to increase the sensitivity of the colorimetric method. For example, nanoliposomes were used as a signal\u2010amplification tool to sensitively detect food\u2010borne pathogens (Figure 2B).63 Since one nanoliposome contains many cysteine residues, which can induce aggregation of Au NPs, even one target pathogen could successfully be detected. Manufacturing the nanoliposome system requires several steps involving binding and washing processes, as shown in Figure 2B; (i) goat anti\u2010mouse IgG antibodies (Fc specific) are coated on polystyrene microwell plate; (ii) mouse monoclonal antibodies (pathogen specific) are introduced for increasing specificity and reducing cross\u2010reactivity; (iii) the target pathogens (E. coli O157:H7, S. typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes) are allowed to bind to the monoclonal antibodies; (iv) polyclonal antibodies (pathogen specific) are bound to target pathogens in the sandwich mode; and (v) biotinylated IgG molecules are introduced for binding streptavidin, which can bind biotin\u2010modified nanoliposomes. This multistep process required for diagnostics is a major disadvantage of using this system for a wide range of applications, which urges development of simpler fabrication methods.",

Thus, adsorption of unmodified DNA or peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to unmodified Au NPs has been utilized to detect pathogenic bacteria and viruses.66 For example, DNA of Cyprinid herpesvirus\u20103 was successfully detected with citrate\u2010stabilized Au NPs (Figure 2C).67 Also, dsDNA and ssDNA can be differentiated by colorimetric assay in the presence of salt (e.g., NaCl) due to their different electrostatic properties. While dsDNA forms a stable double\u2010helix geometry with the negatively charged phosphate backbone, ssDNA with a relatively flexible phosphate backbone exposes its bases to Au NPs.68 Thus, ssDNA can be adsorbed onto the surface of negatively charged Au NPs by van der Waals attractions, resulting in the formation of a colloidal suspension. On the other hand, dsDNA cannot be adsorbed. Thus, in the presence of herpesvirus\u20103 DNA, the probe ssDNA binds to form dsDNA, causing aggregation of Au NPs and consequently visible color change from red to purple.

For example, a peptide\u2010functionalized PDA (PEP\u2013PDA) vesicle system was developed to detect influenza H1N1 virus by the naked eye (Figure 3B).76 In the presence of the H1N1 virus, the color of the PEP\u2013PDA vesicles changes from blue to red due to the increase of the energy bandgap of PDA. The high affinity of the functionalized peptide sequences to the HA protein of the influenza H1 strain makes the PEP\u2013PDA vesicles highly specific to the H1N1 virus.",

SPH and CHO were introduced for improving the colorimetric response of PDA vesicles. Lysine is decarboxylated to cadaverine by pyridoxal phosphate\u2010containing enzymes in S. choleraesuis. Consequently, cadaverine destabilizes the PDA backbone, resulting in a color change of the PDA/SPH/CHO/lysine vesicles from blue to red. Although highly sensitive detection (e.g., \u224810 cells) using PDA vesicle could be achieved, it required long assay time (e.g., 48 h). Thus, further studies are required to significantly reduce the assay time while maintaining or further improving the sensitivity.",

Noble metal (Au, Ag, and Pt) NMs with unique optical, electrical, and catalytic properties give significantly enhanced colorimetric sensing performance, but the systems can be too expensive for large\u2010scale applications in clinical and environmental settings. As not all NMs exhibit the unique optical properties required for colorimetric responses, testing of various NMs for their suitability will be the first step. For example, white or colorless silicon (Si) NPs are not suitable for use in colorimetric detection, although Si is one of the most abundant elements on the Earth. For making colorless Si NPs colorful, doping of various organic dyes on Si NPs has recently been reported and utilized in colorimetric diagnostics.10, 78\n",

Conjugation/hybridization of target\u2010specific bioreceptors on the surface of NMs is a necessary step in making a colorimetric diagnostic system. However, methods for modifying NMs and bioreceptors and also conjugation are time consuming and labor intensive.81 Thus, integration of NM synthesis, modification of NMs and bioreceptors, and their conjugation in one\u2010step or fewer steps than conventional fabricating calorimetric diagnostic methods will significantly reduce the time, effort, and costs required for fabricating the diagnostic system. Modification of NMs with small molecules (e.g., citrate and amino acid residues) during the synthesis of NMs has already been reported.82 Thus, one can naturally come up with an idea of conjugating/hybridizing target\u2010specific bioreceptors (e.g., DNA, RNA, antibodies, and proteins) during the synthesis of NMs. However, NM synthesis is mostly performed under rather harsh conditions, which can denature or degrade such bioreceptor molecules of interest. Thus, it is of great interest to use biosynthesized NMs, as their biosynthesis steps are compatible with bioreceptor conjugation/hybridization.83 We and others have reported biosynthesis of various metal NPs using various biological systems.84, 85 As such strategies and methods are being continuously developed, it is expected that rapid, sensitive, selective, convenient, and cost\u2010effective colorimetric detection systems will be developed and more widely applied for the diagnosis of a more diverse range of pathogens and also other agents and molecules of interest.",
