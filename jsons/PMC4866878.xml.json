The major routes of virus internalization are clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, used by Semliki Forest virus (SFV) 1 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 19, and macropinocytosis, used by vaccinia virus 20, 21, Ebola virus (EBOV) 22, 23, 24 and others 25, 26. Some viruses, notably influenza, can use either mode of internalization depending on which pathway is functional in a given cell under given conditions 27, 28, 29, 30. Other means of internalization are caveolar endocytosis, used by certain non\u2010enveloped viruses, as well as clathrin\u2010 and caveolin\u2010independent endocytosis.",

            "text": "Despite the various modes of internalization, most endocytosed enveloped viruses traverse the canonical endocytic pathway and enter the cytoplasm through either early endosomes, late endosomes or endolysosomes depending on which compartment has the proper environmental cue(s) to trigger and support fusion (Figure 1). While entry through endosomes does not necessarily imply a requirement for low pH for fusion 31, 32, 33, for most endocytosed enveloped viruses a major determinant of the entry site is the pH dependence of the viral fusion reaction (Table 2). The pH dependence of fusion varies among enveloped viruses 7, and these differences can correlate with the endosomal site of fusion 41. Hence, viruses with relatively high (\u223cpH 6) pH dependencies, such as SFV 41 and VSV 42, generally fuse in early endosomes, whereas those with lower pH dependencies (\u223cpH 5), including most strains of influenza, generally fuse in late endosomes 13. The pH dependence for influenza virus fusion varies by \u223c0.7 pH units among different strains, with human influenza viruses generally requiring lower pH than avian ones. This variation in pH triggering has been proposed as an \u2018acid stability marker\u2019 as part of risk\u2010assessment analyses designed to predict the human transmissibility of influenza virus 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. However, single\u2010particle tracking analyses of several clinical and laboratory\u2010adapted H3 influenza viruses show that the typical acid stability assay (pH onset of syncytia formation) may not provide enough information about the rates of fusion and fusion inactivation to predict viral tropism in all cases 49.",

For these, the pH of fusion correlates with the pH needed to induce fusion\u2010activating conformational changes in the viral fusion protein, which in turn generally correlates with fusion in an early or a late endosome. However, even these simple cases have modifiers, such as special target membrane lipid requirements 6, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54. In other cases, low pH may be necessary, but not sufficient, to trigger fusion. This applies for endosomal entry of certain retroviruses and coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses vary in the number of different types of glycoproteins that protrude from their membranes. For example, retroviruses display a single transmembrane glycoprotein (Env), while most influenza viruses display two: a hemagglutinin (HA) and a neuraminidase. Other enveloped viruses display more than two surface proteins. Nonetheless, for all characterized enveloped viruses one glycoprotein is the fusion protein, the protein that actually merges the viral and cellular membranes (Table 3). For reviews on the structures and mechanisms of viral fusion proteins, see references 60, 61, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 and primary citations within. For viruses that encode a single transmembrane glycoprotein (e.g. retroviruses and filoviruses) that glycoprotein is the fusion protein. For viruses with two transmembrane glycoproteins (e.g. orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses), the fusion protein is one of the two (e.g. HA of influenza virus). As reviewed in references 59, 60, 70, 71, large DNA viruses such as herpesviruses and poxviruses employ fusion machines, which consist of four (herpesviruses) or more (poxviruses) proteins associated with the virus membrane. However, at least for herpesviruses, one transmembrane glycoprotein, gB, is the fusion protein. Another important point is that despite their differing prefusion and postfusion structures, all characterized viral fusion proteins share a common architecture in their postfusion forms, a trimer\u2010of\u2010hairpins.",

All characterized class I and II viral fusion proteins must be primed before they can be triggered to induce fusion. Priming entails a proteolytic event that converts the fusion protein from a fusion\u2010incompetent to a fusion\u2010competent state (Figure 2). For class I fusion proteins the cleavage occurs in the fusion protein (precursor), whereas for class II fusion proteins, it occurs in a companion protein (Table 3). Depending on the viral fusion protein and the cells infected, priming can occur in the Golgi, at a cell surface or in an endosome. For example, for most strains of influenza virus, cleavage of the HA precursor (HA0) occurs in the extracellular space or at the cell surface by trypsin\u2010like proteases, but highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 are cleaved in the Golgi by furin\u2010like proteases based on the presence of a multibasic cleavage site 73. Proteolytic priming separates HA0 into a receptor binding (HA1) and a fusion (HA2) subunit. Consequently, the fusion peptide is found at the amino terminus of HA2. Aspects of HA priming, for example accessibility of the cleavage site within HA0 (including obstruction by carbohydrates) as well as the host cells and tissues where priming occurs and the proteases involved, are thought to be critical determinants of influenza pathogenesis 43, 74, 75. Other priming events, as for the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) 76, 77 and the F protein of henipaviruses 78, 79, 80, occur in endosomes, mediated by cathepsins or other proteases. Most importantly, irrespective of the cellular site where it occurs, the protein (fusion or companion) cleaved or the proteases involved, priming converts the fusion protein to a fusion\u2010competent state (Figure 2).",

            "text": "The next stage of fusion is triggering, which for viruses that enter through endosomes is induced by an endosomal cue(s). An early consequence of triggering is exposure and repositioning of the fusion peptide (or loop) to engage the target bilayer; before triggering, the fusion peptide/loop is buried or tacked down in the fusion protein structure (or, for VSV G, points to the viral membrane) and therefore inaccessible to the target membrane. Upon triggering the fusion peptide/loop is exposed and inserts into the target membrane forming an intermediate termed a prehairpin (Figure 2). The prehairpin is a unique biological structure in which a single protein, the viral fusion protein, is simultaneously anchored in, and therefore bridges, two distinct membranes: the target membrane via the fusion peptide/loop and its own (viral) membrane through its transmembrane domain (TMD). Class I fusion proteins are trimers in their prefusion and postfusion states. Interestingly, while all characterized class II fusion proteins are dimers (that sit low on the viral surface) in their prefusion states, they convert, through a monomeric intermediate, to homotrimers once their fusion loops lodge in the target membrane 68, 81, 82. After prehairpin formation, the fusion protein folds back upon itself, drawing the attached target and viral membranes closer and closer together. The final postfusion state of all characterized viral fusion proteins is, therefore, a trimer\u2010of\u2010hairpins. Although there is debate 83, it is commonly thought that multiple fusion protein trimers act in concert 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91 to induce the later stages of fusion: close membrane apposition, formation of a lipid stalk, opening of a small fusion pore and expansion of the pore 92, 93, 94, 95, to create a passage for the viral nucleocapsid.",

Unsurprisingly then, the pH dependence for key conformational changes in HA correlates with the pH dependence for fusion 43, 149, which, as mentioned previously, varies for different influenza strains. Low pH is also sufficient to trigger alpha\u2010, arena\u2010, bunya\u2010, flavi\u2010 and rhabdovirus fusion proteins (Table 3).

Exposure of certain enveloped viruses to low pH can also elicit changes to the matrix layer underlying the virus membrane. For influenza, protons can access the matrix layer through the M2 channel in the viral envelope 165, 166. Exposure of the matrix to H+ and K+, which can also enter via the M2 channel, likely aids later stages of fusion and/or uncoating 167, 168, 169.

            "text": "Most enveloped viruses that fuse at neutral pH are triggered solely by binding to a host cell receptor(s) (Figure 3, Tables 2 and 3). Some neutral pH fusing viruses (most retroviruses) possess a single glycoprotein (Env) whereas others (e.g. herpesviruses) have more. Retroviral Envs are class I fusion proteins. Binding of the receptor(s), to the receptor\u2010binding subunit of Env, unclamps the fusion subunit, which then proceeds through conformational changes that mediate fusion (Figure 2). An interesting case is Env from murine leukemia virus (MLV), a \u03b3\u2010retrovirus. MLV Env contains a thiol exchange motif (CXXC) in its receptor\u2010binding subunit. Engagement of the host cell surface receptor activates this motif, which then isomerizes a disulfide bond between the CXXC motif and a CX6CC motif in the fusion subunit. By breaking this critical disulfide bond, the fusion subunit is unclamped and executes the fusion cascade 180. A similar isomerization occurs in Env of human T\u2010cell leukemia virus, a \u03b4\u2010retrovirus 181. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a lentivirus within the retrovirus family, presents a different case. The two subunits of HIV Env are not disulfide\u2010bonded and HIV Env does not contain a thiol exchange motif. For most HIV strains Env engagement with its primary receptor (CD4) elicits a change in its receptor\u2010binding subunit that reveals a binding site for a co\u2010receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5). When the co\u2010receptor binds it unclamps the fusion subunit allowing the fusion cascade to follow 138, 182, 183, 184. While it had been thought that all of these events happen at the plasma membrane, some findings suggest that the (posthemifusion) content mixing stage of HIV fusion requires endocytosis and dynamin (but not low pH) 31. However, the exact site of fusion for specific strains of HIV in specific (physiologically relevant) cell types is currently under study 133, 134.",

The fusion protein of ASLV (Env) is a class I fusion protein. Unlike MLV Env, ASLV Env does not contain a thiol exchange motif in its receptor\u2010binding subunit (SU). In this case, binding of the ASLV receptor (Tva) to SU triggers conformational changes in SU 187, 188 that release the clamp on the fusion subunit, thereby allowing Env to form a prehairpin embedded in the target membrane via its fusion loop 189, 190, 191. Subsequent exposure to low pH induces the fold\u2010back events that generate a six helix bundle\u2010containing trimer\u2010of\u2010hairpins (Figure 2) and hence fusion and viral entry 139, 140, 141, 142, 152, 192, 193, 194, 195. A His residue in the chain reversal region (between the N\u2010 and C\u2010heptads) of the fusion subunit influences the pH dependence of fusion 152. This and a nearby His also influence the stability of the ASLV six\u2010helix bundle at low pH 196. Interestingly, differences among six\u2010helix bundles in terms of their dipole moments, stability at low versus neutral pH as well as the types of stabilizing interactions employed correlate with the pH dependence of fusion for certain retroviral (and filoviral) fusion proteins 196. ASLV Env is the only viral fusion protein currently known to use a clear\u2010cut two\u2010step mechanism where receptor binding triggers prehairpin formation and low pH triggers the fold\u2010back steps leading to hemifusion and fusion pore formation.

Following internalization by macropinocytosis 22, 23, EBOV traffics to and fuses in endolysosomes (Figure 1) that contain its intracellular receptor, NPC1, and two\u2010pore channel 2 (TPC2), which is also required for EBOV entry 198, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233. Before or upon arrival in endolysosomes, low pH\u2010dependent cathepsins remove the mucin\u2010like domain and glycan cap from GP1 76, 77, 116, 234, 235. This priming step converts EBOV GP1 (formerly 130 kDa) to a 19\u2010kDa species. Importantly, the fusion subunit (GP2) is still clamped in 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 236, 237. Priming (to 19\u2010kDa GP1) has two important consequences: it exposes residues in GP1 critical for binding to NPC1 228, 235 and it appears to potentiate 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 for fusion triggering 236. An important observation about primed 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 is that it still requires low pH and a factor(s) thwarted by the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d to mediate entry 77, 230, 233, 238. Concordantly, low pH and binding to NPC1 are necessary, but apparently not sufficient, to trigger productive 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2\u2010mediated virus\u2013cell fusion 228.",

The first is that the fusion loop (in GP2) undergoes a low pH\u2010dependent conformational change contingent on residues important for GP\u2010mediated entry 117, 121. The second is that low pH stabilizes the postfusion (six\u2010helix bundle) form of EBOV GP2 239, 240, 241. The third is that in vitro\u2010induced conformational changes in primed EBOV GP occur more readily at low pH 236. While a recent study detected cell\u2013cell fusion mediated by 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 at neutral pH, the fusion pores formed were small and non\u2010expanding 242, likely not large enough to pass a viral nucleocapsid. Moreover, the latter findings 242 are difficult to reconcile with the observations that 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2\u2010mediated entry and infection are potently inhibited by both bafilomycin and E64d 77, 230, 238, and that only small structural changes were observed in the 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 ectodomain bound to the NPC1 C\u2010loop and crystallized at pH 5.0 243. Collectively, these findings suggest that in addition to NPC1 and low pH, another factor(s) is needed to mediate EBOV fusion in a manner that will lead to productive infection.",

However, neither the factor(s) responsible for the E64 sensitivity nor its target (19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 or a host constituent) has yet been identified. The roles of other potential triggering factors also remain unclear. Interestingly, the fusion subunits of EBOV GP and ASLV Env share structural and functional similarities 152, 196. Both contain a CX6CC motif, but neither of their receptor\u2010binding subunits contains a thiol exchange motif (CXXC), as seen in the MLV and HTLV Envs, which use disulfide bond isomerization for fusion (see above). Hence, an analogous fusion\u2010triggering mechanism for EBOV GP would require exogenous reducing activity. While disulfide reducing agents (at low pH) can induce the 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 ectodomain to bind to target membranes 236, there is no evidence for a physiological role for disulfide bond reduction for EBOV entry. Even the role of NPC1 is still unclear. As for LAMP1 in LASV entry, does NPC1 play an active role in fusion triggering (i.e. induce significant conformational changes in 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 at physiological temperature) or is a main role, for example, to direct fusion to the limiting membrane of the endolysosome (i.e. away from the numerous small vesicles found within endolysosomes)? The role of TPC2 also remains to be elucidated 230, 232. Hence, triggering of primed 19 kDa\u2010GP1\u2010S\u2010S\u2010GP2 to form a productive fusion pore is complex, and it may represent a novel mode of fusion triggering.",

While it was originally predicted that pestivirus and hepacivirus E2 proteins were class II fusion proteins, new evidence suggests this is not the case. First, the structures of the pestivirus 251, 252 and HCV 253, 254 E2 ectodomains do not conform to the class II fusion protein fold. Second, at low pH, the N\u2010terminal domain of pestivirus E2 is disordered 252, as seen for the E2 protein (the receptor binding, not fusion, protein) of Sindbis virus.

As elaborated above, detailed fusion mechanisms \u2013 encompassing key structural elements and key structural changes in the fusion protein, and key environmental triggering cues (low pH, receptors and proteases) \u2013 are now known for representatives of class I, II and III fusion proteins. Many questions remain. For examples: Are there additional classes of enveloped viral fusion proteins? Are there additional fusion\u2010triggering mechanisms? What are the common principles by which proteases trigger fusion proteins post receptor binding? How is fusion triggering orchestrated in multicomponent fusion machines? In another vein, recent work suggests that enveloped virus\u2010membrane fusion can spark signaling responses that trigger innate immune responses 266, 267, and that cells can use interferon\u2010inducible transmembrane proteins to block virus\u2013cell fusion 268. For their part, some viruses, notably HIV, have evolved means to counter attempts by cells to thwart virus\u2013cell fusion 269, 270. How exactly are these battles between enveloped viruses and cells enacted? And lastly, while there are drugs in use, in development or under consideration that block enveloped virus fusion 271, can we develop antifusion antiviral strategies that are broadly applicable, cost\u2010effective, non\u2010toxic and potent?",

Upon triggering, the receptor\u2010binding subunit moves out of the way unclamping the fusion subunit so that it can form a prehairpin embedded in the target membrane via the fusion peptide (red). The prehairpin then folds back causing the N\u2010 and C\u2010\u03b1\u2010helical heptad repeats to form a six\u2010helix bundle (6HB) and progressively pulling the target (pink) and viral (light blue) membranes through stages of close apposition (iv), hemifusion (v) and fusion pore formation (vi).
