We searched MEDLINE using search terms such as \u201centerovirus\u201d, \u201centerovirus 68\u201d, \u201cHEV-68\u201d, \u201cEV-68\u201d, and \u201cEV-D68\u201d for all EV-D68 reports up to the start of the outbreak (September, 2014). Some laboratory studies were identified, as were several case studies and case series that described basic clinical features of the infection. In the past decade, reports from the USA and globally have increased and typically describe small and localised clusters of EV-D68 infections. Although basic epidemiological and clinical features are described, these clusters typically included less than 30 individuals with little information available.\nAdded value of this study\nThis is the largest outbreak of EV-D68 recognised to date, and our study shows that EV-D68 can cause widespread severe respiratory illness. Furthermore, this investigation characterises epidemiological and clinical features of severe EV-D68 infection in a large group of patients, and suggests that a history of asthma or reactive airway disease is associated with illness severity.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nClinicians and public health professionals should be aware that EV-D68 can cause severe respiratory illness. Enhanced surveillance for EV-D68 and investigation of identified cases is recommended to improve our understanding of EV-D68 circulation and its contribution to respiratory disease.\n",

This outbreak is the largest and most widespread outbreak of EV-D68 reported to date.

These cases are a substantial underestimate of the true count, because only a selection of patients with severe illness was tested. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the EV-D68 viruses circulating at that time were from two lineages, both of which were detected across the USA, suggesting that this outbreak was widespread and not likely to be a series of smaller localised clusters. The reason for the widespread circulation of EV-D68 in 2014 is unknown. Generally, enteroviruses are considered ubiquitous in the community, but with unpredictable annual variations in circulation and outbreak patterns.3 EV-D68 strains identified during this outbreak are very similar to those detected sporadically over the past few years in the USA and elsewhere, indicating that the 2014 EV-D68 outbreak is unlikely to be the result of a novel virus strain. More detailed phylogenetic analyses of EV-D68 strains are ongoing. Testing practices probably played a part in increased detection and case ascertainment. Historically, EV-D68 typing by either neutralisation or molecular sequencing has been done by only a few specialised laboratories, restricting the number of cases identified. Recent introduction of multipathogen PCR panels in many large hospitals, however, has greatly expanded the detection of enteroviruses generically, especially in respiratory illness in which enteroviruses were not previously routinely considered. This has indirectly contributed to the recent increase in reporting. The substantial rise in respiratory illness detected by syndromic surveillance, however, suggests that increased testing is unlikely to be the only contributor. Studies from across the world that have retrospectively typed stored specimens suggest that EV-D68 circulation has been present at low levels in recent years.8, 10, 12, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n",

However, existing syndromic surveillance detected increases in both inpatient and outpatient respiratory illness during the outbreak period in the three states investigated. This highlights the importance of such systems in characterizing outbreaks. For the detection of EV-D68 going forward, afebrile presentations should be considered in the design of such systems, because many aim to detect influenza-like illness and include fever as a detection criterion. The full scope of EV-D68 circulation, both geographical and temporal, remains unknown. Enterovirus season in temperate climates is typically summer and autumn, but some cases can occur into the winter.3 Because of few data, EV-D68 seasonality is not well characterised.

Additionally, the increases noted in these data in 2014 compared with 2013 and 2012 might have been influenced by increased media and public awareness during a nationwide outbreak. Although emergency department visits might be affected by this attention, we would not expect a substantial effect on patients admitted to hospital. Due to the regional syndromic data being reported in aggregate, we were also not able to directly compare these findings to the patient-level data received. During this investigation, specimen collection and testing focused on severely ill patients and therefore we were unable to describe the full severity spectrum of respiratory illness. The criteria for specimen submission was not standardised and might not be representative of all those admitted to hospital and, furthermore, collection priorities changed among the states through the course of the investigation. Additionally, data completeness was not uniform and some variables, such as race, ethnicity, and detections of other pathogens, were less well reported. For the latter, testing algorithms were not standardised and probably varied among hospitals and providers across the country. An age-specific selection bias might have also been introduced in that most reporting facilities were children's hospitals. Samples from adults were sought and tested, but awareness might have been increased in the paediatric settings. Previous reports would suggest that a higher number of adult cases might have been expected,3, 4, 12 although these studies were not focused on severe disease. Paediatric intensive care unit admission criteria might have varied across the country, possibly introducing a misclassification of severity in our comparative analysis; however, our results are strengthened by the consistent observation of the effect of asthma or reactive airway disease noted by use of two severity methods.",
