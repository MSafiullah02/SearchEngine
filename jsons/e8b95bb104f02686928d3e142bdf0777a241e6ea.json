This early recognition and intervention gives the patient the greatest chance of surviving a significant infection. Crucial to the management of any serious infection in the Intensive care unit and elsewhere is the early use of appropriate antibiotics.

This leads to a range of morbidities as discussed in the immunocompromised section of this chapter. Viral infections are mostly diagnosed clinically on the basis of history and physical examination as well as the regional prevalence of viral diseases. There are a number of ways to test for the presence of a particular virus from either patient blood or other body fluids. These are: tissue culture, serology and seroconversion, immunoflouresence, and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Only two of these are of any use to the intensivist: PCR and Immunoflouresence. The turnaround time for viral culture and serum serology is inefficient in the critical care context.",

However they are at risk of surgery-related complications and postsurgical infection issues (wound infection, bacteremia, atelectasis/pneumonia, urinary tract infection). 2. Infection of the transplanted organ due to latent or colonizing organisms present in either the donor or recipient can lead to invasive widespread disease in the immune suppressed post-transplant recipient. An example of this is the child with cystic fibrosis colonized with Pseudomonas species; those colonized with B. cepacia are particularly at risk of developing resistant infection post lung or combined heart/lung transplants. 3. Children receiving solid organ transplants are at risk of reactivation of latent infections, such as CMV. But, unlike HSCT patients who most commonly present with CMV pneumonitis in recipients of solid organ transplants the CMV disease depends on the sites where the virus is latent and on the organ that has been transplanted. Lung, heart/lung, and liver transplant patients are most vulnerable to systemic disease. CMV infection can precipitate rejection and increase vulnerability to other infections such as fungal infections. 4. EBV-associated post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a potentially fatal complication of solid organ transplant. The risk of PTLD is higher in children who were EBV seronegative prior to the SOT. EBVrelated infection in SOT patients may present in several different ways: asymptomatic or nonspecific viral syndrome, mononucleosis syndrome, and PTLD. The latter can have a spectrum from fever, lymphadenopathy and diarrhea to full blown lymphoma. Tissue biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis of PTLD. The mainstay of therapy consists of decreasing immunosuppression. Chemotherapy and biological treatments (such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies) have been used.",

To facilitate this, a number of devices are used that breach the body's normal defense mechanisms. For example, endotracheal tubes to facilitate mechanical ventilation obstruct secretion management hence secretions need to be suctioned; central venous lines (CVL) breach the skin and provide a conduit for bacteria into the blood; Urinary catheters provide conduits for bacteria from the perineum to the internal urinary structures (bladder and kidneys). On top of this, patients may be debilitated medically, nutritionally compromised, victims of traumatic injuries or post operative patients with wounds that can potentially become infected. It is not surprising then that a large number of patients requiring Intensive care acquire some form of nosocomial infection.
