Most of them suffer from what virologist Nathan Wolfe calls \"the usual suspects\": malaria and typhoid. But every once in a while there is something a little different: a case that is tough to diagnose, or that doesn't respond as expected to medication. For the patients and the medics here, this presents a problem. For Wolfe, it is also an opportunity. \"I get all excited,\" he says. \"These areas are choc-a-block full of interesting, unusual viruses.\"",

Since then, Wolfe has made a name and a livelihood for himself in search of more. In 2007, he founded the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative (GVFI), an effort to monitor for new viruses and other microbes in communities around the world that are in intimate contact with animals. By identifying these agents as soon as they leap into humans, and before they start passing easily between them, Wolfe believes that researchers can predict and prevent human pandemics before they start, averting the next HIV, SARS, Ebola or pandemic influenza, diseases that have all been traced to animals.

He never answered the question \u2014 but while tracking chimpanzees in the forests of western Uganda, Wolfe witnessed several dramatic ambush hunts. \"The chimps were up to their eyeballs in the blood and body fluids of all these animals,\" he says. \"I just thought to myself what a perfect scenario for cross-species transmission of microbes.\" He postulated that the rural human populations of Central Africa, with a diet heavily dependent on bush meat, could be affected the same way. \"I just thought it would be this wonderful grab-bag of new things jumping into humans and bouncing around,\" he says.",

Wolfe started to follow subsistence hunters into the forest as they caught and butchered monkeys and other wild animals. As the hunters walked back with the catch over their shoulders, blood would run down their backs and into the cuts on their bare legs and feet. Wolfe thought that there was a high chance that viruses were passing between them, and he collected blood from the hunters and screened for retroviruses related to those found in non-human primates. There was precedent: researchers think that the retrovirus HIV was originally transmitted to humans from non-human primates in Central Africa, perhaps during hunting or butchering.",

The next year he reported the discovery of two new human retroviruses \u2014 called human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) \u2014 one of which is related to a group of simian viruses and both of which are likely to have crossed over from non-human primates1. Another member of this viral group, HTLV1, is also thought to have spread into humans and is associated with leukaemia and other conditions. Wolfe's studies suggested that certain viruses were passing from non-human primates quite freely and frequently into humans. \"Retroviruses are jumping over all the time,\" says Wolfe, even though \"only a few of them end up being significant\".",

Microbe discovery \"doesn't rate real well\" in funding applications that tend to focus on known threats, says Gregory Gray, who studies zoonotic infections at the University of Florida, Gainesville.
