            "text": "There remains debate over clean hospitals when considering hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).1\n,\n2 A visual experience of dirty hospitals is automatically linked with infection risk but this is difficult to prove for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are already several known risks for patients acquiring infection in hospital \u2013 antimicrobial consumption, insufficient isolation rooms and poor hand hygiene, for example. Secondly, since cleaning has never been investigated as a discrete scientific entity, it is impossible to determine just how important it might be towards overall infection control.1 Finding the evidence to support cleaning as a significant intervention for preventing infection has been seriously disadvantaged because there are no accepted risk-based standards to verify whether a hospital is truly clean and safe.3 Finally, there is confusion between nursing and domestic personnel over allocation of cleaning responsibilities. Even established cleaning regimens do not necessarily target high-risk reservoirs due to a lack of evidence and education.",

Visual assessment will inevitably be subject to bias under these circumstances, as well as subject to an individual\u2019s perception.1 Despite this, there is general consensus that environmental cleanliness is important for controlling infection.

It has been assumed that Gram-negative bacilli are more vulnerable to exposure on surfaces, and therefore pose less of a risk to patients.1 This assumption has been challenged by studies that detail prolonged survival periods for some Gram-negative species.7 For example, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. have been shown to survive more than a year under certain conditions, and Serratia marcescens up to 2 months.7 In contrast, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been shown to survive for a year in hospital dust, the spores of Clostridium difficile for five months and epidemic vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) for up to four years.10., 11., 12.\nAcinetobacter can survive in surface dust for at least a month, with some strains reportedly surviving for up to 3 years.8\nPseudomonas aeruginosa usually only survives for a couple of days but will persist for five weeks on a dry floor.7\n,\n13 Along with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas spp. demonstrate long-term persistence within biofilm adherent to hospital plumbing components and other water-exposed sites.14\n,\n15 Most respiratory viruses such as coronavirus, rhinovirus and influenza can survive on dry surfaces for a few days, with gastrointestinal viruses retaining viability for a couple of months. Norovirus is found in the hospital environment for days after an outbreak, demonstrating survivability despite terminal cleaning with bleach-based products.16\n,\n17 Fungi such as Candida spp. may persist in hospitals for up to four months, although there are very few reports detailing the risk of cross-infection from an environmental source.7\n,\n18\n,\n19\n",

Outwith the outbreak situation, the effects of enhanced cleaning were monitored on two matched surgical wards in a prospective controlled cross-over trial for two 6-month periods.59 There were nine ward-acquired MRSA infections during routine cleaning periods, but only four when the wards received extra cleaning, notably targeting hand-touch sites and clinical equipment. More MRSA patient-days during the enhanced cleaning periods predicted at least 13 new cases instead of the 4 that actually occurred. The study concluded that targeted cleaning using detergent wipes and water could be a cost-effective mechanism of reducing MRSA infections.59\n",

The authors concluded that decreasing environmental contamination might help to control the spread of VRE in hospitals.85 Introducing an educational programme, contact precautions and reinforcement of environmental cleaning was the response to escalating VRE cases in a Brazilian hospital.86 Enhanced cleaning emphasised use of bleach for bathroom surfaces and 70% alcohol for furniture and patient equipment. The overall package helped prevent dissemination of VRE throughout the hospital, including intensive care, with a decrease in attack rate from 1.49 to 0.33 (p < 0.001).86 Bleach-based terminal cleaning was used for an earlier study to control VRE in a haemato-oncology unit, again as part of an intervention package.84\n",

The other unit introduced the intensive hypochlorite clean into isolation rooms housing patients already infected with C. difficile.

Persistence of viral reservoirs means that new admissions will be exposed to norovirus, and with current pressures to reduce the length of stay, there is a higher throughput of increasing numbers of patients vulnerable to norovirus.17 Without scrupulous cleaning attention, outbreaks will quickly resume.",

The cleaning process could potentially have a huge impact on this risk, if it is aimed at the most frequently contaminated sites, physically removes or kills viable organisms; and takes place a sufficient number of times to inhibit the accumulation of pathogens delivered by air or hands. Whilst there are a flourishing number of novel disinfectants, antimicrobial surfaces and equipment now on the market, few have been properly assessed against patient infection risk and potential toxicity represents a long-term environmental threat. Establishing risk-based standards for all surfaces throughout the hospital would allow monitoring, measurement and scientific evaluation for the benefit of all patients and staff.187 Frequent application of detergent-based cleaning requires urgent appraisal in order to be able to adequately and comprehensively compare future alternatives for cleaning our hospitals.",
