            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease that poses a major threat to the health of people worldwide [1, 2]. The etiological agent is a novel coronavirus: SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2\u20134]. After infection with the SARS-CoV, there is an incubation period ranging from 2 to 10 days, followed by a wide spectrum of symptoms and signs with the characteristic presentations of fever, dyspnea, progressively changing radiographic findings, and/or respiratory failure [2, 5, 6]. A recent study reported that decreases in SARS-CoV load preceded disease progression and suggested that overexuberant immune responses, rather than uncontrolled viral replication, may contribute to the progressive damage to the lung [7]. Pathological investigation of SARS pneumonia has revealed hemophagocytosis, which is reminiscent of pneumonia due to H5N1 influenza virus, and suggests that proinflammatory cytokines are dysregulated [8]. However, little is known about the temporal relationship between viral load, cytokine dysregulation, and clinical progression. Moreover, the effect of ribavirin therapy on viral load in vivo remains largely unclear. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we measured the SARS-CoV load in sequential throat-wash specimens obtained from patients with probable SARS and examined its relationship with ribavirin, proinflammatory cytokines, and disease progression. Throat-wash specimens were chosen because they are reported to have a high positivity rate for SARS-CoV among patients with probable SARS [3, 9]. From a technical perspective, throat-wash specimens are easier to collect than are currently recommended specimens, including nasopharyngeal aspirates and swab specimens and oropharyngeal swab specimens.",

All cases of SARS were confirmed by laboratory testing [10]. The first day of fever is defined as day 1 of illness. Sequential chest radiography and routine laboratory tests were performed at least twice per week. Oral ribavirin was given for 10 days unless adverse effects were noted, and methylprednisolone was administered during the second week for most patients or during the first week for patients with a rapidly progressing disease course, as described elsewhere [11]. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given to patients with severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or marked progression of lung lesions [11].",

This finding suggests that the viral load patterns vary among different patients and that some patients have a more protracted and complex profile. When comparing these findings with ribavirin use, a decrease in the viral load was found in 4 cases (patients A, B, C, and F). However, viral load remained high despite >10 days of ribavirin therapy, in patients D, E, and H. In patient G, the viral load decreased before the administration of ribavirin, and then increased and decreased after ribavirin was received. This finding suggests that ribavirin was not effective in reducing the viral load in 3 of the 8 patients studied.",

In contrast to the IL-6 and IL-8 levels, the TNF-\u03b1 level was not detectable in most patients and, therefore, was not analyzed. The elevation in the IL-8 level generally paralleled that of the IL-6 level, although a delayed increase (between days 18 and 20 of illness) was found in 3 cases (patients D, F, and H) in the absence of nosocomial infection or other identified insults (figure 1) . Overall, the peak IL-6 and/or elevated IL-8 levels concurred with or after the peak viral load and preceded or concurred with the maximum pulmonary infiltrates (figure 1). Of note, the elevation of the IL-6 levels associated with the second viral load peak was not observed in patients G and H, probably because of steroid use on day 9 and day 11, respectively. The temporal relationship between peak viral load and IL-6, as well as the subsequent development of maximum pulmonary infiltrates, the nadir lymphocyte count, and the peak LDH level, is summarized in figure 2. These findings suggest that initial viral replication leads to activation of proinflammatory cytokines that, together with other factors, contribute to disease progression.",

[7] examined the viral load pattern in 14 patients who received ribavirin and steroid therapy. Because the viral load was not analyzed with respect to the exact time course of therapy for each patient, the effect of ribavirin on viral load was not addressed. In this study, we examined the effect of ribavirin on viral load in vivo. Despite the small sample size studied, we closely monitored the viral load and ribavirin use in each patient. We report different profiles of viral load during the course of infection and that use of ribavirin does not result in reduction of viral load in \u223c40% of the patients studied. Whether ribavirin use is associated with the high mortality among patients with SARS requires further investigation.",

            "text": "This is the first study investigating the temporal relationship of viral load, proinflammatory cytokines, and clinical progression. Although there was some variation in the cytokine profiles, our analysis revealed a common picture and indicated that the elevation of IL-6 and/or IL-8 levels subsequent to the peak of viral replication is involved in pulmonary progression (figure 1). Similarly, the occurrence of the nadir lymphocyte count and peak LDH level lagged behind the peak viral load and IL-6 level (figure 2). This suggests that an immune-mediated process is involved in lymphopenia and tissue damage in patients with SARS [14]. Of note, the nadir lymphocyte count seems to correlate with the peak viral load (P = .084), raising the possibility of a direct effect of viral replication on lymphopenia. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis of a viral replication phase followed by an immune response phase in the pathogenesis of SARS. Moreover, these findings provide important information on therapeutic strategies for SARS, including antivirals and immune-based regimens, such as steroids, IVIG, and convalescent-phase serum infusions. With regard to convalescent-phase serum infusions, we also examined IgG seroconversion in these 8 patients by an indirect immunofluorescence assay described elsewhere [15]. As shown in figure 1, seroconversion correlated with the decrease in viral load in most cases. However, a delay in the decrease of viral load was found in patients E and F, and the viral load remained high in patients D and H in the presence of antibody. Although a study preliminarily suggested the efficacy of convalescent-phase serum infusions [16], our observation suggests that development of antibody may not correlate with clearance of virus, which should be taken into consideration before using convalescent-phase serum infusions as a therapeutic strategy.",
