            "text": "Early in transfusion compatibility, hemolysis, whether delayed or immediate, was the most life-threatening condition/risk. As blood groups were discovered and avoidance of stimulation of alloantibodies became the norm, transfusion transmissible infections became a greater risk. The risk for acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is reported as 1 in 76,000 and that of bacterial contamination of platelets is 1 in 3000.1 Most infections were not usually immediately evident, but some came to be recognized as equally fatal as the immediate death from septic transfusions. In the 1940s, testing for syphilis was initiated.2, 3 Syphilis is a disease of direct transfusion.3 The causal organism is not stable at colder temperatures: after 72 h at 1\u20136\u00b0C it is not viable and it becomes nonviable immediately at freezing temperatures. During the 1950s, blood was no longer collected from paid donors or inmates to decrease the incidence of transmission of hepatitis.2 With the development of health questionnaires, which eventually became the universal health questionnaire, the risk for transmission began to decline. In the 1990s, tests were developed to detect antibodies and eventually antigens of hepatitis viruses to further decrease the risk of transfusion transmission.2 Eventually, nucleic acid testing (NAT) was developed to detect exposure to pathogens by detecting their genetic material in the donor, which has resulted in lower risks for transmission of infection and has created the safest blood products in history. Infection rates for most viruses are very low secondary to screening. Only higher incidence rates can be measured directly; when the rate is less than 1:105, mathematical modeling is required to predict the residual risk. This is a testament to the benefit of the screening questionnaire and serologic testing and NAT in producing the safest transfused blood components to date.4\n",

In 1998, approximately 13,000 donors were deferred based solely on this questionnaire.6 Those who are not aware of having this illness have been further screened with an enzymatic immunoassay test to detect the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, or hepatitis B core antibody and alanine transferase in the 1980\u2019s and using NAT since 2012.7 Historically, hepatitis not caused by hepatitis A or B viruses was called hepatitis non-A non-B. The majority of these was found to be hepatitis C. After screening for hepatitis B, the posttransfusion hepatitis risk was 1 in 400 with 90% of these being due to hepatitis C.5 Like the hepatitis B virus, the viruses causing hepatitis C typically have an indolent course, which may lead to severe morbidity and eventually mortality through liver failure or hepatitis carcinoma. These viruses are detected in the donor with enzymatic immunoassay (EIA) testing, recombinant immunoblot assay for confirmation, and NAT. The transmission of this infection has decreased from 1:100 to 1:1.9 \u00d7 106.6, 8\n",

HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 were discovered in the 1980s. HTLV can cause lymphoproliferative or demyelinating diseases in those infected, leading to T-cell leukemia or HTLV-associated myelopathy. To prevent the transmission of this virus, serologic testing for antibody against HTLV has been performed since 1988. For this, EIA has a sensitivity and specificity of 99.4% and 98% and Western blot has a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 65%, respectively. Those receiving seropositive blood products had a 25%\u201363% conversion rate.9 Products stored longer were less likely to be infectious. If stored less than 5 days, contaminated units had 75% transmission rate, and if stored longer than 11 days, the risk decreased to 0%. Multiple case reports from around the world demonstrate the transfusion transmissibility of this virus. One case was from a walking donor pool acquired during treatment at military combat operations.10, 11 At present, no NAT is performed for HTLV and none are under development.

Initially, infection and transmission via blood transfusion were thought to be rare events. As time progressed and the seriousness of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome prognosis and ease of transmission via blood transfusion became more appreciated, health questionnaire screening was developed because high-risk populations were identified. In the early 1980\u2019s, transfusion transmission of HIV was more recognized and further work on screening testing came to the forefront because screening for history of high risk was not sufficient to protect transfusion recipients. By early 1985, serologic testing for HIV was developed and donor testing was initiated.2 The questionnaire decreased the risk from 1:100 to 1:5 \u00d7 104; screening with EIA, antigen testing, and Western blot confirmation decreased the risk to 1:5 \u00d7 105; finally, NAT decreased the risk to 1:1.9 \u00d7 106. Only four cases of transfusion transmission have been reported from 1999\u20132009. In the United States, the last case of transmission of HIV in via blood transfusion occurred in 2008.12 Continued formation of new clades will require updating the questionnaires and testing, as was done most recently with clade O, the most recent to arrive, this one from Africa.",

Because we have gained control of the screening out of viruses, the potential clinical sequela of bacteremic/septic transfusion reactions has received more attention. Transmission of these organisms is much more frequent than that of viruses. DHQ and mini-physical examination, puncture site preparation, diversion pouch, and subculturing platelet units have decreased the risks somewhat. Septic reactions occur from bacterial/pathogen-contaminated blood components, usually originating from the blood donor at venipuncture site or during unsuspected bacteremia. Less commonly, it may also result from donor unit processing. Bacterial contamination is more likely to occur in components stored at room temperature than in components stored refrigerated. The risk of transfusion transmission remains relatively high at 1:30,000 for red cells and 1:3000 for platelets as opposed to the residual risk after viral screening. At the time of collection, bacterial contamination of components is about 10 colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and initially no sepsis occurs when the components are stored for short periods. At the end of the storage time, however, these same components can have 107\u2013109\n CFU/mL. This level of contamination can much more easily lead to sepsis especially in the most at-risk immunocompromised patients.

Single-donor platelets (apheresis) and platelet concentrates (3\u20136 donor pools) are stored at higher temperatures than red cell units. Platelets are stored at 20\u201324\u00b0C with agitation for up to 5 days. These storage conditions favor aerobic bacterial growth. Organisms typically causing bacterial septicemia more often are skin flora including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus; however, Serratia, Bacillus, and Salmonella are also among the most common bacterial contaminants in platelet products. Acinetobacter, Proteus, Klebsiella, and Serratia have also been implicated in fatal septic transfusion reactions. Propionibacterium acnes has been found as a common contaminant of blood products but is usually associated with minimal morbidity and mortality; nonetheless, one fatal reaction with transfusion has been reported. Bacteremic/septic reactions are usually seen at the end of storage of the platelet unit at day 4\u20135. Higher bacterial septic reactions secondary to longer stored platelet units in 1985 led the FDA to reverse the 7-day storage to 5 days. In the 2005\u201308 period 7-day storage was again attempted after subculturing platelets 24 h after collection to try to screen out contaminated units. This reduced the risk slightly but not significantly, and storage was again set for 5 days. Storage is limited to 5 days because longer storage continues to be associated with unacceptable rates of bacterial transmission. When S. aureus contaminates platelets, there is a 2-day lag, whereas with Enterococcus faecalis, there is no lag in the growth period. The doubling time for these organisms is \u22643 h. By day 3\u20135 there are 108\u2013109\n CFU/mL of component. Efficacy for removal of bacteria with leukocyte depletion is less clear for platelet products. Risk for bacteremia from platelet transfusion is 1:103\u20133 \u00d7 103. Transfusion-related sepsis risk ranges from 1:1\u20135 \u00d7 104 and 1:4.7 \u00d7 103, depending on the study; with subculturing, the risk of immediate death from septic transfusion is 1:5 \u00d7 105. 29, 31, 32, 33, 34\n",

The risk of transmission from the donor is decreased with the mini-physical examination and clinical, medical, and travel histories. Phlebotomy site risk is reduced by ruling out intravenous drug use, evaluating for skin lesions, and preparing the site with iodine or chlorhexidine and alcohol. Donor bacteremia risk is evaluated with a history of dental procedures, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and current osteomyelitis. Contamination of blood collection containers is a very rare event with better sterility of the plastics used. When processing (thawing) products, water baths may be a source of contamination and should be cleaned regularly. At the time of issue further steps can be taken. A visual inspection of the unit for color changes, hemolysis, or turbidity is performed. Red cell units tend to be much darker in color because the bacteria use the oxygen stored in the red cells; platelets have lower pH and loose \u201cswirling\u201d when potential contamination is present. These units should be quarantined and not issued to patients. Blood components should be transfused within 4 h of being issued from the blood bank. Proper storage temperature during transport is also recommended. Transfusion administration tubing sets should be changed between blood transfusions per policy: approximately every 4 h. At the time of issue products can be examined to evaluate for contamination. Septic reaction is the fourth leading cause of death as a complication of transfusion. While receiving a transfusion, signs of a septic reaction include temperature greater than 102\u00b0 F (or higher than 2\u00b0F or 3\u00b0 C above baseline temperature), chills, rigors, tachycardia (heart rate greater than 40 beats over baseline) and shock/falling systolic blood pressure (30 mm Hg below systolic), backache, nausea/vomiting, and unexplained bleeding from mucous membranes or the infusion site. Renal failure may follow later. Once suspected, transfusion is immediately halted and the patient given supportive treatment. Maintain respiratory status, and use mechanical ventilation if indicated. Maintain cardiovascular support with vasopressors as indicated. With the patient stabilized, initiate transfusion reaction workup; send blood (pink or purple tube) and first posttransfusion urine (not from Foley collection bag) to the laboratory. Also send the unit with attached administration set to the laboratory. Perform a gram stain and culture from the implicated blood component and administration set. Draw blood culture from the patient, preferably from two sites. Prompt initiation of intravenous antibiotics as indicated by the gram stain results. Again, future use of pathogen reduction agents will greatly decrease the risk of bacterial transmission of blood products.29, 35\n",

It is associated with transfusion transmission as shown in at least 162 transfusion events, all red cell components. Freezing red cells did not prevent the transmission of infection. This organism is closely related to Plasmodium. The vector of Babesia is the ixodid tick with the primary species in the United States being Babesia microti. It is most commonly seen in the United States in the New England region and the North Midwest states (e.g., Wisconsin, Minnesota). Humans are an accidental host. Risk of transmission is at 1:105. Patients infected with this organism have a long incubation period, 1\u20136 weeks after a tick bite and 1\u20139 weeks after contaminated transfusion, as well as prolonged infectivity. Many are asymptomatic with mild fevers at most. If immunocompromised, the patient may develop hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Travel history is remote to the incidence of inoculation and is a poor screening tool. At present, there are serologic and polymerase chain reaction studies being performed with immunofluorescence assay (IFA)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)/NAT; Phase III clinical trials are ongoing to test for this pathogen and screen out potentially infected donors.2, 3, 37\n",

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) may be sporadic, infectious, or inheritable. Even though there is potential for transfusion transmission of this disease, to date there have been no documented human cases of transfusion transmission of this classic form of CJD. There is no donor testing for this, and deferral is permanent to all those with a history of this illness. For variant CJD the story is different. This disease first occurred in the United Kingdom in 1994 and was recognized as a distinct disease in 1996 as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease). There is no known vector; cattle and humans serve as reservoirs. Experimentally, in animals a intravascular phase is present before symptoms and there is widespread deposition and replication in the lymphoreticular tissues. Transfusion transmission has been documented. This prion is likely to survive any storage conditions of blood products secondary to the physiochemical characteristics noted in other prions. Incubation of infection is 5\u201315 years. With transfusion incubation is quicker at 5\u20138 years. Leukocyte reduction may offer some protection; nanofiltration is effective in experimental model systems. Affinity-based prion removal filters are under development. Pathogen reduction has unknown effect on prions.38, 39\n",

Now with better screening questions, travel/medical history and screening tests we have decreased the risk of transfusion transmission of infection to many-fold lower levels. Where once the primary cause of death was infection from transfusion, now transfusion transmitted infections may cause only 10% of the transfusion-associated deaths (Fig. 8.1\n). We have become very good at discovering transfusion transmitted agents and screening for their presence (Fig. 8.2\n). This, however, takes time and a new virulent pathogen may still await us and we will not be protected by geography. Pathogen reduction technology will soon become routine in the United States as it is in Europe. As this technology becomes easier to use it will become more accepted and utilized first in our most high-risk immunocompromised populations and then universally, as it happened with leukocyte reduction. Commercially developed tests are performed to screen pathogen, but nanofiltration, solvent detergent, and pasteurization reduce the risks of pathogen transmission not detected with screening tests. These processes cannot be used on cellular products. There are processes in place for pathogen reduction in platelets and plasma. For whole blood or red cell components, Phase III studies are ongoing, and in the near future these can be added to our pathogen reduction repertoire.40\n",
