            "text": "A large number of viruses (e.g., caliciviruses, coronaviruses, many enteric picornaviruses, and reoviruses) are primarily transmitted from host to host by the fecal\u2013oral route. Thus, the predominant route of host infection by such viruses is enteric. During a gastrointestinal infection, such viruses must go through the stomach and endure an acidic pH that can be as low as 0.82 (Vander et al., 1994). Successful replication of viruses, similar to other obligate intracellular pathogens, requires that the pathogenic organism gain entry into susceptible host cells. Initial steps in such a process involve recognition of the host cell by appropriate viral proteins. After attachment of the virus to a suitable receptor, the virus must be internalized. While some details of how viruses are internalized remain controversial, there is mounting evidence that entry of many viruses is mediated by conformational changes that take place in virus structural proteins. Some of these changes appear to involve exposure of the virus to acidic pH and others appear to involve proteolysis of external virion proteins White and Fenner 1994, Young 2001.",

            "text": "The mammalian orthoreoviruses (reovirus) are the prototypic members of the nonfusogenic Reoviridae, enteric viruses that consist of a genome of double-stranded (ds) RNA encased in multiple concentric protein capsids. Reoviruses are constructed from eight structural proteins arranged as two concentric capsids; an outer capsid that surrounds an inner capsid \u201ccore\u201d (reviewed in Nibert and Schiff, 2001). The outer capsid is composed of up to 36 copies of the cell attachment protein \u03c31 (Larson et al., 1994), 600 copies of protein \u03c33 (Dryden et al., 1993), and 600 copies of protein \u03bc1, which occurs in the viral capsid both as \u03bc1 and its cleavage product \u03bc1C (Nibert and Fields, 1992). The inner core, which is the transcriptionally active structure that produces progeny capped and methylated mRNA from the genomic dsRNA (Yeager et al., 1996), comprises two major proteins (120 copies of \u03bb1 and 150 copies of \u03c32; Reinisch et al., 2000), and two minor proteins (12 copies of \u03bb3 and about 20 copies of \u03bc2; Coombs, 1998). Sixty copies of an additional protein (\u03bb2) form pentameric spike structures at each of the virion\u2019s icosahedral vertices Ralph et al 1980, Metcalf et al 1991, Dryden et al 1993 that bridge the inner and outer capsid layers.",

Upon exposure of the ISVP to the cytosol it is subsequently converted into the core particle. Evidence also suggests that ISVPs may be formed extracellularly by proteolysis of the virion with proteases such as pepsin in the stomach, or chymotrypsin or trypsin in the intestinal lumen Bodkin et al 1989, Vander et al 1994, and that these ISVPs can directly cross through the membrane, bypassing endocytic uptake Borsa et al 1979, Sturzenbecker et al 1987.",

Under these conditions, digestion of \u03bc1C into \u03b4 and \u03c6 occurs shortly after \u03c33 has been removed, implying that \u03c33 occupies an outermost layer within the virus particle that covers accessible sites in \u03bc1C, consistent with structural interpretations from electron cryomicroscopic (Dryden et al., 1993) and X-ray crystallographic (Liemann et al., 2002) image reconstructions.",

            "text": "To slow the digestion of \u03c33 and attempt to identify regions of outer capsid protein \u03c33 that are initially cut, and presumably exposed on the surface of the intact virion, we then digested highly purified virions with a significantly lower amount of enzyme for shorter and comparable amounts of time and analyzed resulting products. Treatment of virions with 10 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1-chymotrypsin at 37\u00b0C for as little as 6 s resulted in the appearance of two smaller polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 27 and 12.5 kDa, as resolved in SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 1B, arrowheads). The sum of these two polypeptide fragment molecular weights is close to the molecular weight of the 41 kDa \u03c33 protein, suggesting the two peptides result from a single cleavage of the protein. Longer digestions lead to the appearance of additional smaller peptides and the eventual generation of a peptide profile similar to that of ISVPs (Fig. 1B, rightmost lane). Treatment of purified virions with low concentrations of other proteases (trypsin, Glu-C, and pepsin) at various pH values for suitable periods of time also led to the generation of two polypeptides (Fig. 1C\u2013E, arrowheads), whose aggregate molecular weights added to about 41 kDa. To identify each of the polypeptides generated by each of the proteases and determine precisely where \u03c33 was cut by each of them, we resolved larger aliquots of briefly digested virions in preparative gels, excised the 27- and 12.5-kDa bands, and subjected each to in-gel tryptic digestion. Digests then were extracted from the gel matrix as described under materials and methods and examined by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS (i.e., peptide mass mapping) (Fig. 2B\u2013E). All peaks detected were checked against a database of predicted \u03c33 and trypsin peptide masses to assign peaks to appropriate \u03c33 peptides (Table 1) and the amino acid sequences of some peaks were examined by tandem mass spectrometry to corroborate amino acid assignments. For each of the larger 27-kDa polypeptides, we were able to identify a number of \u03c33 peptides, including those corresponding to amino acids 23\u201334, 123\u2013143, and 203\u2013208 (Fig. 2F, bars above sequence scale line). Each of the smaller 12.5-kDa polypeptides contained several \u03c33 peptides, including those corresponding to amino acids 248\u2013259, 297\u2013310, and 313\u2013326 (Fig. 2F, bars below sequence line). In addition, depending upon the initial protease used prior to gel purification, additional tryptic fragments were identified that allowed us to determine the exact cleavage sites used by each protease. For example, the large 27-kDa polypeptide generated by chymotrypsin digestion contained a tryptic fragment with an m/z value of 2918.359, predicted to correspond to amino acids 214\u2013238 and the small 12.5-kDa polypeptide contained a tryptic fragment with an m/z value of 1069.657, predicted to correspond to amino acids 239\u2013247. In addition, the large 27-kDa polypeptide contained no tryptic fragments that would correspond to amino acids from residue 239 to the C-terminus and the small 12.5-kDa polypeptide contained no tryptic fragments that would correspond to amino acids from the N-terminus to residue 238. Analyses of these fragments accounted for 220 of the 365 predicted amino acids in \u03c33 (60.3% coverage). We initially did not observe fragments that would correspond to either the N-terminus (residues 1\u201322) or the C-terminus (348\u2013365). However, these terminal fragments were detected in direct MALDI-Qq-TOFMS measurements of longer digestions (below), suggesting they were present within the 27- and 12.5-kDa polypeptides but not effectively eluted from the gel matrix. Taken together, these observations indicate that the initial cut made in \u03c33 by \u03b1-chymotrypsin occurs between Tyr238 and Arg239 (Fig. 2G, H), also as very recently determined (Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002). The identities of many of these tryptic fragments were corroborated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) (see below). Similar analyses of the large and small peptides generated by other proteases indicated that trypsin cut predominantly between Arg236 and Ala237, although, in a small proportion of \u03c33 molecules, the initial trypsin cut was between Arg259 and Ala260 (which is consistent with the appearance of a doublet in the gel (Fig. 2A)), and Glu-C cut predominantly between Glu217 and Trp218, irrespective of whether the reaction was performed at pH values of 7.4 or pH 4.5, which is consistent with the slightly faster migration of the Glu-C-generated large peptides (Fig. 2A). There were some differences in the distribution of tryptic peptides identified after Glu-C digestion under different pH conditions, suggesting some minor acid-induced conformational changes in \u03c33. No peaks corresponding to amino acids C-terminal of residue 214 were found in the 27-kDa polypeptide generated by Glu-C digestion at pH 7.4 (Table 1). However, small peaks corresponding to tryptic fragments 214\u2013236 (m/z 2647.335) and 209\u2013236 (m/z 3290.522) were observed in spectra generated from 27-kDa polypeptides purified after Glu-C digestion at pH 4.5 (Table 1), suggesting that, in some particles treated at this acidic pH, Glu-C cut between Glu241 and Leu242. Analyses of tryptic fragments in the large and small pepsin-generated peptides indicated that this protease initially cut \u03c33 at one of two possible sites, and with apparently nearly equal efficiency. Thus, some \u03c33 molecules were initially cut between Ala237 and Tyr238, whereas other \u03c33 molecules were cut between Thr244 and Pro245.",

In addition, whereas gel analyses required visualization of nanogram quantities of peptide, the approximately 100-fold greater sensitivity of the MALDI-Qq-TOFMS instrument might reveal early rare events undetectable by SDS\u2013PAGE strategies. Thus, to perform more complete analyses of the cascade of proteolytic events that take place in multiple viral capsid proteins during digestion with various proteases at different pH values, we treated purified reovirus particles with proteases used above and analyzed released peptide fragments directly by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS at a variety of time intervals. We initially chose trypsin to study early proteolysis of surface-exposed epitopes at neutral pH because of the relatively large number of arginine and lysine residues in most reovirus capsid proteins. For these studies it also was important to maintain viral structural integrity. Preliminary MS experiments tested various buffer solutions. Reovirus virion particles were unstable in ammonium bicarbonate solution (normally suitable for MALDI analysis; data not shown), but virion structure was retained in Tris\u2013HCl buffer with physiologic concentrations of salts (normally too high for MS analyses). To simplify MS analyses, controlled experiments examined the amount of signal noise normally caused by salts in the mass spectra of virus digests by comparing spectra generated from virus alone, protease alone, and virus plus protease in buffers of various ionic strength. In addition, true peptide fragments appeared with increasing intensities during longer digestion times, and individual peaks were subsequently identified by MS/MS measurements. Initial analyses of a complete tryptic digest of reovirus serotype 1 Lang (T1L) virions allowed subsequent identification of the major outer capsid proteins \u03c33 and \u03bc1, and the core proteins \u03bb1, \u03bb2, and \u03c32 (data not shown). Identities of all peaks resolved in this initial tryptic digest spectrum were corroborated by tandem MS and used as reference for amino acid assignments in this study.",

Results are summarized in Table 2. Examination of peptide fragments released during shorter digestion periods predicted that the first peptide released from \u03c33, at 90 s, with an m/z value of 2684.226, corresponded to residues Ser214-Arg236 (predicted m/z value of 2684.230) (Table 2A).

With increased digestion times, additional peptides that corresponded to regions immediately N-terminal of, and C-terminal of the Ser214-Arg236 peptide, were identified (Fig. 5A\nand Table 2A) and confirmed by MS/MS (data not shown).

Entry of reovirus is thought to involve conformational changes associated with acidic treatment prior to proteolysis. Therefore, we also examined proteolysis of purified virions at low pH. Samples of purified T1L virions were adjusted to pH 3.0 or 4.5 and then digested with pepsin or Glu-C, respectively, at 37\u00b0C. Equivalent aliquots were removed at various time points ranging from 30 s to 24 h. Digestions were inhibited with the immediate addition of 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 to pepsin-digested samples (confirmed to raise the pH sufficiently to irreversibly inhibit the enzyme), or by the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to Glu-C-digested samples. Digestion products were analyzed by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. All Glu-C peptides were identified by peptide mapping and high-accuracy mass measurements to allow direct comparison to corresponding peaks previously identified by peptide mapping and MS/MS measurements of the pH7.4 Glu-C-treated samples (above), whereas all identified pepsin fragments were sequenced with MS/MS analysis because of pepsin\u2019s nonspecific cleavage. For example, the low-energy MS/MS spectrum of the second ion detected after pepsin digestion (at m/z 1419.741) revealed a set of b and y ions shown in Table 3B, corresponding to amino acids 195\u2013206. Results of both acidic digestions are summarized in Table 2C. The first peak identified after digestion of intact virions with Glu-C at pH 4.5 corresponds to \u03c33 amino acids Gly199-Asp217, the same peptide initially released by this protease at pH 7.4. However, the first peptide identified after pepsin digestion of virions at pH 3.0 corresponded to amino acids Asn111-Leu128 in \u03c33. This pepsin-digested fragment is about 100 residues closer to the N-terminus than where trypsin and Glu-C originally cleaved at pH values of 4.5 and 7.4, suggesting a conformational change in \u03c33 had taken place as a result of the more acidic treatment (Table 2 and Fig. 5).",

Compared to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, the tolerance to impurities permits the sample to be analyzed without any further separation or purification by methods similar to liquid chromatography. This alleviates sample losses associated with additional separation, which was particularly important for observation of the first peptides released during time-course digestion studies, which appeared after a few seconds at relatively low concentration compared to the salts. The technique is also fast, even with a low repetition-rate laser, allowing a large number of samples to be acquired in time-course studies. This is essential to distinguish changes in the spectrum to discriminate against noise. The high mass accuracy (average mass errors are 0.01 Da or less (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3)) in both single MS and MS/MS mode gives high success rate in protein identification by database searches. The high accuracy in MS/MS measurements is also particularly useful for de novo peptide sequencing or for identification of posttranslational modifications.",

            "text": "Previous work has indicated that virtually all reovirus proteins are blocked at their N-termini (Pett et al., 1973). Outer capsid protein \u03bc1 contains a myristoyl group at its N-terminus (Nibert et al., 1991). Very recent reports also have identified an acetyl group at the N-terminus of \u03c33 (Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002), as confirmed in this study (Table 3A), and at the amino-terminus of minor reovirus core protein \u03bc2 (Swanson et al., 2002). The function of an acetyl group at the N-terminus of \u03c33 is unknown, but, based on roles of other acetylated molecules, may serve to provide structural stability Cumberlidge and Isono 1979, Nguyen et al 2000 and/or promote protein complex assembly Berger et al 1981, Tercero and Wickner 1992. Another possibility is that the acetylation of its N-terminus may be required to differentiate the role(s) \u03c33 plays during the virus life cycle. Protein \u03c33 binds dsRNA (Huismans and Joklik, 1976), which may occur only when the protein dimerizes (Olland et al., 2001), \u03c33 is thought to counteract the reovirus induced host antiviral defence mechanism (Yue and Shatkin, 1997), and \u03c33 may play a role in the assortment complex during particle assembly (Antczak and Joklik, 1992). Previous studies also have shown that the efficiency of cellular translation is determined by the cytoplasmic level of \u03c33 that is not complexed with \u03bc1 (Schmechel et al., 1997). Thus, some level of regulation must dictate which of the numerous roles \u03c33 functions in. One possible means of control is through \u03bc1 binding, which would effectively remove freely available \u03c33 protein. Another regulatory role has been postulated to occur upon \u03c33 dimerization (Olland et al., 2001). A third possibility, currently under investigation, is that acetylation of \u03c33 may influence its regulatory roles, as suggested for a number of other acetylated proteins (reviewed in Polevoda and Sherman, 2000).",

The high-resolution crystal structure of the innermost capsid core is known (Reinisch et al., 2000). In addition, the high-resolution crystal structure of outer capsid protein \u03c33 dimers (Olland et al., 2001) and \u03bc1/\u03c33 heterohexamers (Liemann et al., 2002) have been determined and fitted, along with the core crystal structure, into cryo-EM models of the entire virion (Liemann et al., 2002). A large number of dramatic conformational changes, thought to be important in different stages of reovirus disassembly, have been described. These include changes during cell attachment (Fernandes et al., 1994), uncoating (Dryden et al., 1993), and transcription (Yeager et al., 1996). However, the entire virion has, to date, resisted crystallization and environmentally induced conformational alterations in the complex, that may result from exposure to acidic pH and pepsin (such as when this enteric virus passes through the stomach where the pH can be as low as 0.8; Vander et al., 1994), are poorly understood. The present analyses of purified virions by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry has furthered this understanding and has provided evidence about the nature of viral outer capsid proteins in terms of structure, orientation, and conformational alterations.",

            "text": "Digestion of reovirus virions generally resulted in sequential digestion of outer capsid protein \u03c33, followed by sequential digestion of \u03bc1. When virions were digested with \u03b1-chymotrypsin, pepsin, trypsin, and Glu-C protease, \u03c33 digestion initiated within a protease hypersensitive region (Fig. 2), which indicates this region is located on the external surface of the virion. Other studies that examine \u03c33 digestion have recently determined that this hypersensitive region is also initially cut by other proteases, including alkaline proteases such as trypsin (Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002) and acidic proteases, such as cathepsins Ebert et al 2002, Jane-Valbuena et al 2002. Our strategy of directly measuring peptides released from protease-treated intact particles by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS also allowed us to determine subsequent proteolytic events during the cascade of \u03c33 and \u03bc1 digestion. These time-course studies showed that protein \u03c33 digestion proceeded bidirectionally toward both the N-terminus and the C-terminus, except that tryptic peptide fragment Ser144-Lys162 did not appear until after the remainder of the protein had been completely digested, which suggests this peptide may have been particle bound, and/or it may be this region of \u03c33 that interacts with underlying \u03bc1, as suggested in the \u03bc1/\u03c33 heterohexamer structure (Liemann et al., 2002). This result was not observed when virions were digested with Glu-C protease, which may be attributable to the fact that there are far fewer Glu-C cleavage sites that could result in the lack of detection of such a fragment.",

The appearance of this \u03bc1 fragment suggests that the C-terminus of \u03bc1 is accessible to trypsin and hence may be exposed on the surface of the virion, consistent with a recent hypothesis that this unresolved portion of \u03bc1 in the \u03bc1/\u03c33 crystal structure constitutes an exposed blob within the virus (Liemann et al., 2002). Furthermore, immunologic assays, using monoclonal antibodies directed against \u03bc1, react with intact virions, which suggest a portion of \u03bc1 is exposed on the virion surface Hayes et al 1981, Virgin et al 1994, as also suggested by other structural studies Dryden et al 1993, Liemann et al 2002. Initial digestion of \u03bc1 by such proteases may be a prerequisite for reovirus uncoating and membrane penetration, a possibility that is currently under study.",

            "text": "The present MALDI-Qq-TOFMS analyses of purified reovirus virions identified different initially released peptides when T1L was digested with different proteases under different pH conditions. This may provide evidence that T1L \u03c33 molecules undergo a conformational change when exposed to acidic pH. However, we acknowledge difficulty in interpreting data from using two different enzymes with different amino acid cleavage specificities under these significantly different pH conditions. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any single enzyme that operates efficiently under both pH conditions. Thus, it also is possible the different initially released peptides result from different enzyme specificities. To attempt to alleviate the difficulty in interpretation of experiments carried out with different enzymes under different pH conditions, we also performed experiments with Glu-C, which, unlike trypsin and pepsin, can operate under widely different pH conditions (pH 7.4 and 4.5). Tryptic digests of \u03c33 proteins that had been cut only once with Glu-C (Fig. 2 and Table 1, columns 4 and 5) revealed minor differences, while kinetic studies of the cascade of proteolytic events in whole particles (Fig. 5, and compare Table 2B to 2C) revealed no differences. Part of the difficulty with using Glu-C for such comparative studies is the lower frequency of appropriate cleavage sites in \u03c33 and their uneven distribution, which results in some sequence-predicted peptides that would lie outside the normal operating m/z range (500\u20135000) of the MALDI-Qq-TOFMS used. Other apparent paradoxes are that the initial Glu-C cleavage site (Glu217) and initial fragment released by Glu-C digestion (Gly199-Glu217) appear, predicted from fitting the \u03c33/\u03bc1 heterohexamer crystal structure into whole particle cryo-EM reconstructions (Liemann et al., 2002), to reside in regions of the \u03c33 protein that abut other \u03c33 proteins located in adjacent \u03c33/\u03bc1 heterohexamers. Resolution of this apparent conflict, which may result from the different methodologies of comparing static crystal structures to virions digested in solution, the latter of which may be capable of \u201cbreathing,\u201d as well as additional studies to better examine possible pH-induced conformational alterations, are underway. Interestingly, despite these differences, \u03c33 is completely cleaved rapidly under each of these conditions to generate a subviral particle, which suggests the virus has evolved to successfully uncoat itself under a variety of conditions likely to be encountered during infection.",

Aliquots of virus were digested with proteases within 14 days of having been dialyzed. Purified virions were usually diluted to final concentrations of 3\u20135 mg/ml into buffers precalibrated to produce final pH values of 3.0, 4.5, or 7.4, and then the diluted virions were incubated at 37\u00b0C with various concentrations of Glu-C, chymotrypsin, trypsin, or pepsin at a final protein-to-enzyme ratio of 10:1 to 1000:1. Under conditions of high viral particle concentration, extended proteolysis of virions was confirmed to generate core particles (data not shown). Aliquots from the digestion reactions were collected at various time intervals. For peptides subsequently resolved in polyacrylamide gels, further digestion of viral proteins was inhibited by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to chymotrypsin digestions to a final concentration of 5 mM, by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 125 \u03bcg/ml to trypsin digestions, by addition of 1/25th volume of 1 M Tris pH 8.8 to pepsin reactions, and by chilling Glu-C reactions. One-quarter volume of 5\u00d7 electrophoresis sample buffer was added to each reaction and immediately boiled for gel analysis (below).

For direct MS analyses, nascent digests were immediately placed on ice to arrest proteolysis and diluted to 1 mg/ml with dH2O.
