Epitomizing the role of international clinical scientist, in 1892 the exhaustive efforts of Sir Ronald Ross led him to the discovery that the mosquito bite is the channel through which malaria is passed to humans.15 He later embarked on malaria control programs that spanned four continents with impact across and within various communities, including the construction of the Panama Canal.16 Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, first described by the English surgeon Denis Burkitt while working in Uganda,17 was later associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection in the United Kingdom from tumor samples obtained from Africa.18 The efficacy of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which has completely revolutionized the treatment of diarrheal diseases, was established in studies done in Bangladesh.19 The development of the yellow fever vaccine by Max Theiler also depended on findings extracted from different continents.20 In 1968, Professor Familusi of the virology laboratory of the University of Ibadan in Nigeria identified Mokola virus as a cause of devastating aseptic meningitis.21\n",

Moreover, rapid subject accrual is seen as an opportunity to bring new drugs to market more quickly.28 While this shift by pharmaceutical companies is most welcome, there are significant moral and ethical challenges that must be addressed promptly and adequately by the scientific community at a time when health disparities continue to widen and life expectancies in some low resource countries continue to fall.29 Expanded global research should encompass equity, reduce health disparities, and promote societal benefits while advancing scientific discoveries.

As they live in a constant state of flux, continuous change to strata and forms of leadership impact field research.52 At the local level, changes in the democratic and culture-based governance have a great impact on conducting clinical studies beyond granting permission and providing support. As most of these communities are tight-knit, the opinions of both spiritual and temporal authorities greatly impact the general population. Changes in such leadership following succession or political mechanisms invariably will impact studies, especially those requiring long-term follow-up. Frequent changes in governance also affect morale in terms of basic job security of local research staff; incessant turnover in management and its priorities can impair study continuity and undermine staff accrual of experience and job satisfaction.",

Second, ethical requirements of Institutional Review Boards for human studies vary between countries.72 In some cases in the developing world, they are in conflict as to whether their requirements should mirror what is available in the west or be tailored to the local reality.
