Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are compounds of great interest which can be used as effective agents for the symptomatic treatment of AD. Although plants are considered the largest source for these types of inhibitors, the microbial production of AChE inhibitors represents an efficient, easily manipulated, eco-friendly, cost-effective, and alternative approach. This review highlights the recent advances on the microbial production of AChE inhibitors and summarizes all the previously reported successful studies on isolation, screening, extraction, and detecting methodologies of AChE inhibitors from the microbial fermentation, from the earliest trials to the most promising anti-AD drug, huperzine A (HupA). In addition, improvement strategies for maximizing the industrial production of AChE inhibitors by microbes will be discussed. Finally, the promising applications of nano-material-based drug delivery systems for natural AChE inhibitor (HupA) will also be summarized.",

It means that these plants are not considered to be effective source for HupA production at the commercial scale. As a result, researchers tried to find other methods to produce HupA such as in vitro plant tissue cultivation and chemical synthesis. Tissue culturing was not considered as a successful technique for HupA production at a large scale (Ma and Gang 2008; Ishiuchi et al. 2013) . Although HupA was totally synthesized from (R)-pulegone (Ding et al. 2012) , the chemical synthesis of HupA showed some limitations such as complex interactions, continual pollution, and expensive processes (Koshiba et al. 2009 ). As these trials have not achieved satisfactory results to be applied at a large industrial scale, the discovery of HupA-producing endophytic fungi from the tissues of Huperziaceae plant species provides an alternative solution.",

The principal advantages of SLNPs are their higher selectivity, biocompatibility, absence of organic solvents during preparation, and improved drug release. However, they exhibited some restrictions such as fixed drug packing space and drug removal capacity throughout the storage process (poor drug loading efficiency) (Mukherjee et al. 2009 ). To overcome limitations of SLNPs, NLCs were developed and received considerable investigations (M\u00fcller et al. 2002) .

In addition, more microbial strain enhancement protocols are needed to be applied. As a recommendation, besides the conventional submerged fermentation (SMF), solid-state fermentation (SSF) may be a promising alternative for the production of AChE inhibitors. Over the years, SSF proved to be a promising system for the production of many valuable products. SSF has many advantages over the conventional SMF including resistance of microorganisms to catabolic repression, low-cost production process, production of metabolites at higher ,yields and the potentiality of applying agro-industrial wastes as nutritional rich substrates (El-Sayed et al. 2019c , 2020c .",
