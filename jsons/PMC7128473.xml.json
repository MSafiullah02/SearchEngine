It remains unclear at this time whether these laboratory test alterations are a sign for pre-existing liver diseases in patients with a more severe course of infection, whether they rather reflect liver damage caused by the virus itself, or whether they mirror a severe inflammatory response (hypoalbuminemia) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (thrombocytopenia). Possibly, patients with advanced chronic liver disease are at increased risk of infection due to cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction.4 The same could be true for patients after liver transplantation and possibly those with autoimmune liver diseases who receive immunosuppressive therapies.",

            "text": "However, currently, there are only limited data available linking underlying liver diseases with the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and there are many open questions (Box 1). Chronic hepatitis B virus infection for example, which is more prevalent in China than Europe, does not appear to affect the outcome of COVID-19.1 In addition, although there is no proof for this assumption, immunosuppression may even provide some protection from immunopathology, which appears to contribute to lung damage in cases with more severe manifestations of the disease.5,6 These may be associated with a macrophage activation syndrome in the context of a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a cytokine storm with multi-organ failure.7 On the other hand, systemic viral infections are often associated with transient elevations of transaminases which may reflect general immune activation or inflammation caused by circulating cytokines without compromising liver function, a phenomenon called \u201cbystander hepatitis\u201d. This may also be the case in patients with COVID-19 where liver failure has not been specifically reported, even in the most severe and fatal courses of disease.1,2 However, signs of liver dysfunction may occur in critically ill patients with COVID-19,8 as reviewed in.9,10 Whether patients with cirrhosis and COVID-19 are at increased risk of decompensation or development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), as has been shown for influenza infection,11 remains to be determined. SARS-CoV-2 may also directly infect liver cells as the receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),12 has been shown to be expressed on cholangiocytes,13,14 which may explain cases of viral shedding into the faeces.15,16 How far observations from Asian cohorts can be transferred to European populations remains to be determined, but it appears unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes liver damage to an amount that substantially contributes to the overall disease burden.Box 1Open questions for liver-related basic/translational research regarding COVID-19.

In addition, hospital staffs face challenges such as long working hours and even reduced staffing because of COVID-19 quarantining. Therefore, several factors have to be considered by hepatologists who provide care for these vulnerable patients. Clearly, prioritisation criteria need to be defined for outpatient contacts. The general and specific recommendations provided here (Fig. 1) cannot comprehensively cover all patient cohorts and are not backed up by datasets. Moreover, the precise management of these patients strongly depends on the local COVID-19 burden.

At the same time, vulnerable patient cohorts should be protected from individuals with potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection. Thus, in these patients, the benefits of maintaining patient care have to be weighed against the risk of infection. These considerations require adaption of standard operating procedures for outpatient care, including remodelling of waiting areas to allow sufficient distance between patients, reduction of waiting times and encouraging patients to wait outside wherever possible and eventually be contacted by phone.
