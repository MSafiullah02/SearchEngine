The virus genome is a linear, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA with a length of approximately 27 kilobases (kb) [3]. Genes encoding four structural proteins are identified in the genome and designated as spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Among the four structural proteins, the S protein, consisting of S1 and S2 subunits, plays an important role in receptor binding, virus fusion and antigenic neutralization [4], [5], [6]. Furthermore, small changes (<5%) in amino acid sequence of the S1 protein may affect cross-protection [7], thus contributing to complexity of disease epidemiology and control.",

Effective strategies including applications of vaccines containing different antigenic types and multiple immunizations could provide broad protection [9]. However, due to high evolutionary rates, virus replication errors and recombination [10], [11], emerging IBV strains belonging to different genotypes and serotypes have been reported worldwide [12].

An epidemiological investigation of IBV isolates collected from 2013 to 2015 showed that 46.1% of the IBV strains isolated were characterized as QX-like genotype [15]. Not restricted to China, the QX-like genotype has spread widely to other countries in Asia, Africa and Europe [12]. Current vaccine strains used in China are derived from classical strains of Mass genotype. However, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the QX-like genotype is genetically distant from the Mass-type, which may explain the poor performance of these classical vaccines [16]. In Europe, QX-based vaccines were developed [17] and commercial vaccines such as POULVAC IB QX (Pfizer, France) are produced against endemic IBV strains. In China, there were also several attempts to develop an efficient QX-like IBV vaccine through serial passages of field isolates in embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs, take YX10-D90, aYN and P110 for instance. These vaccine strains were proved to be efficient in SPF chickens through intranasal vaccination [18], [19], [20]. However, the process of attenuation requires a long passage time in embryonated eggs, which usually takes up to 1-year, thus is time consuming.",
