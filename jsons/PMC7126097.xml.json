Because MERS was regarded as an emerging infectious disease outbreak in South Korea (Kim, 2015, World Health Organization, 2016), South Koreans were largely uninformed about it. Since they were unfamiliar with MERS, they became increasingly uncertain and concerned about the outbreak.",

Especially, for government and risk communicators, the public's risk perceptions of the public health issues can help individuals understand the situation and manage it better. Media outlets, including television and newspapers, have played a large role in informing the public of health issues as well as shaping the public perception of those issues (Lin and Lagoe, 2013, Morton and Duck, 2001, Shim and You, 2015). In recent years, the numbers of people using social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, has increased, and the use of social media as an informational source for health can influence people's cognition or behavior related to health issues, including risk perceptions and preventive behaviors (Barman-Adhikari et al., 2016, Young and Rice, 2011).",

For example, the heuristic and systematic processing model suggests that people's systematic or heuristic information processing can play a role in shaping risk perceptions (Trumbo, 1999, Trumbo, 2002). Moreover, information processing mode can interact with social media to influence people's perception formation. Social media users encounter various sources of information, including elites news information, users' unfiltered or uncensored information, and tailored information that shows their personal backgrounds or interests according to their online networks (Austin et al., 2012, Lee and Oh, 2013). Thus, social media use could interact with information processing mode in order to interpret the differential information. As a result, it is likely that the interaction between social media and information processing mode plays a role in shaping ones' perceptions.",

In general, risk perception refers to people's subjective estimation of the possibility that negative health-related outcomes or incidents (e.g., diseases) can occur (El-Toukhy, 2015, Menon et al., 2008, Slovic, 1987). It is specifically constructed by two dimensions: susceptibility and severity (Pask & Rawlins, 2016). Susceptibility reflects one's perception of the likelihood of contracting a disease, whereas severity refers to one's perception of the seriousness or harmfulness of a disease (El-Toukhy, 2015, Rimal and Real, 2003). In particular, when people perceive health-related risks, they not only rely on the cognitive aspects of the likelihood and severity of a health-related disease, but also use affective aspects of the worry, concern, or dread that a person feels about a health-related disease (e.g., Freimuth and Hovick, 2012, Oh et al., 2015).",

Thus, understanding the public's risk perception can help manage public health issues and help them escape from it during an outbreak.

In a situation where people have not directly experienced an infectious disease, traditional media, such as television and newspapers, have played a considerable role as major sources of information to the public (Coleman, 1993, Dudo et al., 2007, Paek et al., 2016). The media produce and deliver news and information to citizens regarding public health issues (Lin and Lagoe, 2013, You and Ju, 2015). Since people rely on media as a source of information, the media can help people understand the risks and can shape their perception of the issue. For example, Chang (2012) has shown that exposure to H1N1 flu news in television is associated with the formation of people's risk perception of the pandemic disease.",

In media presentation, it was suggested that perceived susceptibility is related to information that would increase achieving a given health condition, such as numerical risk information, while perceived severity is related to information that would include specific outcomes of a health condition, such as death or negative emotions (McWhirter & Hoffman-Goetz, 2016). In this regard, it is likely that exposure to users' negative emotions, symptoms, or pain concerning MERS could be positively associated with the perceived severity of the infectious disease while exposure to factual information on MERS, such as an increase in number of MERS patients or mortality and fatality rates of the infectious disease, could also be associated with the perceived susceptibility to the infectious disease. As previous studies have examined the risk perceptions embracing both perceived severity and perceived susceptibility as one concept (Hovick et al., 2014, Pask and Rawlins, 2016, Shim and You, 2015), this study also integrates the two components into one dimension to examine the impact of social media on risk perception. Thus, during the MERS outbreak, social media exposure for MERS-related information is assumed to contribute to an increase in people's risk perception for the infectious disease. We propose the following hypothesis.H1Exposure to social media for MERS information will be positively related to risk perception of MERS.\n",

Specifically, because heuristics are represented in a person's memory, people tend to rely on information that is more easily accessible or available stored in their memory when making a judgement that engages in heuristic processing (Kahlor et al., 2003, Zuckerman and Chaiken, 1998). As a quick processing mode that allows people to conserve their cognitive resources (i.e., time and effort), individuals who engage in heuristic processing often use superficial cues, such as previously existing knowledge or similar past experiences, when arriving at a judgment about information (Eagly and Chaiken, 1993, Trumbo, 2002). For example, in order to form their attitudes toward the GM food issue, people who engage in heuristic processing relied on past experiences from other situations similar to the GM food and their existing knowledge without seeking additional information on the issue (Kim & Paek, 2009). Trumbo's research (1999) also showed that under heuristic processing, individuals employed their prior experiences from other situations similar to caner problems and their existing knowledge for arriving cancer risk judgement. In this sense, when engaging in heuristic processing to shape a risk perception of MERS, people are more likely to rely on their past experiences from other infectious diseases similar to MERS and their existing knowledge without seeking additional information on MERS. Thus, the formation and change of an attitude or perception via the basis of heuristic processing may tend to be less stable than that through systematic processing.",

For example, it was found that people who engage in systematic processing are more likely to perceive a greater risk regarding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster than those with heuristic processing mode (Ryu & Kim, 2015). In particular, the association between heuristic-systematic processing and risk perceptions could differ according to a certain context or situation surrounding people. For example, under an uncertain or high concern environment, systematic processing mode was significantly related to a higher level of risk perception for cancer, whereas heuristic processing was significantly related to a lower level of risk perception on the health issue (Trumbo, 1999). Thus, in an uncertain or high concern situation, such as the MERS outbreak, it is likely that systematic processing may increase people's risk perception, whereas heuristic processing may decrease their risk perception. Therefore, we put forth the following two hypotheses.H2Systematic processing for MERS will be positively related to risk perception on MERS.\nH3Heuristic processing for MERS will be negatively related to risk perception on MERS.\n",

            "text": "When a public health issue occurs, such as the MERS outbreak, self-efficacy plays an important role in motivating individuals to overcome their social difficulties (Bandura, 1990). Self-efficacy refers to a person's belief in his or her own capabilities to manage a specific difficult task they are facing (Bandura, 1997). In the public health areas, this belief results in protection motivation leads to changes in attitudes, perceptions, or behaviors (Dorsey, Miller, & Scherer, 1999). In particular, some studies have examined the relationship between self-efficacy and risk perceptions, showing that self-efficacy affects people's risk perceptions of a public health issue (e.g., Coleman, 1993, Han et al., 2014). It has been suggested that optimistic confidence from one's self-efficacy serves as a major predictor for risk perceptions (Han et al.., 2014). That is, people with higher self-efficacy have lower risk perceptions on a health issue, whereas those with lower self-efficacy have higher risk perceptions on the same health issue. Thus, it is likely that self-efficacy for MERS influences decreasing people's risk perceptions on this health issue. Based on this consideration, we propose the following hypothesis.H4Self-efficacy for MERS will be negatively related to risk perceptions on MERS.\n",

In recent years, some studies have suggested that the impact of media use, including social media, on people's cognitions, attitudes or behavior can depend on their individual differences, such as information processing ability or personality traits (e.g., Kim et al., 2013, Lee and Oh, 2013, Yoo and Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 2014). Especially, because social media are designed to customize individual's interests or needs based on users' active behaviors, such as constructing his/her profile, building online networks, or selecting news information (Boyd and Ellison, 2008, Glynn et al., 2012, Lin and Lu, 2011), individual's differences could play an important role in considering the impact of social media. Specifically, people tend to seek and acquire varying gratifications when they use media, such as social media (Hyun and Kim, 2015, Kim et al., 2013). Moreover, individuals often perceive risks depending on their psychological or cognitive characteristics (Sj\u00f6berg, 2000, Slovic, 1987), such as information processing mode (e.g., Trumbo, 2002) or self-efficacy (e.g., Coleman, 1993). Thus, people may utilize social media satisfying their personal needs from their psychological or cognitive differences to formulate risk perceptions (Smock, Ellison, Lampe, & Wohn, 2011), that which would lead to various levels of risk perceptions toward a given health issue. For example, one's information processing mode has been found to moderate the effects of media on his or her risk perceptions (Ho et al., 2013). Since heuristic-systematic processing motivates individuals to process information to reach their risk judgements (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993), it is likely that this information processing moderates the relationship between social media and risk perception. That is, heuristic-systematic processing of MERS may help people process MERS-relevant information from social media, which could differently perceive the risk of the infectious disease. Moreover, because self-efficacy indicates the differences in individual abilities to respond or manage situations (Bandura, 1990), it has found that self-efficacy moderates the impact of media on one's cognition or behavior (e.g., Lee, Kwak, Campbell, & Ling, 2014), suggesting that the potential to moderate the association between social media and risk perceptions. That is, in an uncertain situation, such as the MERS outbreak, as individuals hold different levels of self-efficacy, and when they rely on social media for information regarding MERS to form a risk judgement, the interaction between self-efficacy and social media would lead to different levels of risk perception of the infectious disease. From this perspective, we examine how heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy interact with social media regarding people's risk perceptions.",

The mean age of the respondents was 45.24 years old (SD = 13.46, ranging from 21 to 69), and 50.2% were male (N = 502). The mean education range was between associate degree and bachelor's degree (SD = 0.96), and the median monthly household income fell into the range of 4\u20135 million Korean won (equivalent to approximately $3500\u20134500; SD = 1.37). According to the Korean Statistical Information Service (2015), the mean age of the total population of South Korea in 2015 was 40.4 years old, and 50.1% were male. In addition, 45% of the South Korean adults aged 25 years and older held an associate or higher degree, and the median monthly household income was of about 4.2 million Korean won.

For example, it is hard to deliver specific messages to a large targeted audience through social media, and measuring exposure can be more demanding than with traditional media sources (Hornik, 2016). For greater validity, future studies should consider more sophisticated measures for the variable.
