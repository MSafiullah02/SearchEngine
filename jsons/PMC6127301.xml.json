            "text": "Radiation therapy is prescribed in over 50% of patients receiving cancer treatment. Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), namely pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, can follow radiation treatment to thoracic structures, chest wall, and lower neck, either because lung is part of the target volume or due to its proximity to the tumour target. Pneumonitis follows early after treatment and may be reversible however fibrosis is delayed and irreversible1,2. Rates of RILI can be as high as 70\u201380% in high dose regions of lung3. As there are no reliable predictive models to provide the likelihood or severity of RILI prior to radiation therapy, risk is reduced through dose constraints. Indeed, the risk of developing radiation pneumonitis shapes current recommendations in human planning to minimize the volume of lung receiving 20 Gy (V20) to less than 30%4\u20137. Other factors that contribute to pneumonitis such as age, concurrent chemotherapy and baseline CT findings are difficult to control, thus radiation dose constraints are important when weighing the risk of adverse events8. However, such dose limitation may compromise tumour control. New approaches to mitigate RILI are urgently needed to improve quality of life and long-term outcomes in cancer survivors9\u201314. Such approaches could also serve as a valuable resource for treating mass casualties in the context of a deliberate, or accidental, nuclear or radiological event15.",

Radiation induces DNA base damage, single and double-strand breaks, protein cross-linking and fragmentation, and membrane lipid peroxidation, which leads to both acute alveolar epithelial and endothelial (capillary) damage. Whilst maintaining an intact plasma membrane is essential to osmotic homeostasis and cell survival, its component phospholipids are at particular risk of injury from excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation16. Such ROS cause peroxidation of membrane lipids and increase the ionic permeability of the membrane. The energy cost associated with trying to maintain ionic concentration gradients in the face of such altered structure and function can severely deplete cytoplasmic ATP stores, leading to further generation of cellular ROS, and eventual cell death and necrosis.",

Indeed, early administration of surfactant has been shown to suppress serum levels of TGF-\u03b21 when combined with mechanical ventilation, improving treatment efficacy of RDS25. In addition surfactant administration has been proposed for ARDS/ALI, where surfactant function is impaired26. We proposed that the rationale driving surfactant therapy in these instances could apply equally to the administration of synthetic lamellar lipids for mitigating RILI, where pneumocyte injury occurs early. In this study we sought to determine whether synthetic lamellar lipids (LAMELLASOMETM, Lamellar Biomedical Ltd, Bellshill, Scotland, UK) delivered prior to irradiation could reduce RILI in a novel large animal system used to model the effects of radiotherapy on the lung.",

Images were obtained during anaesthesia with breath-hold to avoid motion artefact. Treatment planning software (Eclipse v11.0, Varian Medical Systems Inc, Palo Alto, CA) was employed to delineate structures and enable conformal 3-dimensional 6MV photon plan design by a board certified veterinary radiation oncologist blinded to the treatment groups. Organs at risk (OAR) were outlined to permit dose calculations and consisted of left lung, right lung, left mainstem bronchus, right mainstem bronchus, heart, oesophagus, trachea, spinal cord, reticulum, rumen, abomasum, and omasum. A clinical target volume (CTV) was manually created in the left caudal lung lobe starting at a level approximately 6 cm caudal to the level of the tracheal bifurcation, such that the medial border was 1 cm away from midline and the lateral border 0.5 cm away from the lateral thoracic body wall. A planning target volume (PTV) was created following 3 cm expansion of the CTV in all directions, confined within the left lung. At least 0.5 cm between the medial PTV edge and midline was required to ensure the mean dose scattered to the right lung was less than 1 Gy. The radiation prescription consisted of 5 fractions of 6 Gy to isocentre (central point defined in the target volume through which radiation beams pass) within the PTV to a total dose of 30 Gy with each fraction to be administered at 3- or 4-day intervals. In order for the plan to be approved, minimum dose to CTV and PTV were required to be 26 Gy and 25 Gy, respectively. Due to the lack of solid mass within air-filled lung, dose heterogeneity was permitted provided 95% of the PTV received at least 27 Gy and the mean dose was 29\u201330 Gy. The volume of lung receiving 20 Gy or higher (V20) was limited to 30%. Additional dose constraints determined prior to the study to avoid clinical toxicity included constraints to reticulum (V20 < 20%), rumen (V20 < 20%), abomasum (V15 < 20%), and liver (V30 < 20%). Maximum dose for any OAR was set at 33 Gy. To enable radiation treatment, sheep were anaesthetized and positioning verified with orthogonal on-board portal images.

All H&E stained sections were scanned on a whole slide scanner (Nanozoomer, Hamamatsu, Japan) to acquire whole slide images (WSI) at x40 magnification. These sections were then subject to detailed examination by JDP. Following an initial appraisal in which principal pathologic features were identified, a semi-quantitative scoring system was developed to capture the incidence and extent of each feature amongst the different sections. Briefly, to score lesions for feature severity, each section was allocated a score ranging from 0 (absent), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), to 3 (severe). Features noted included intra-alveolar macrophages, oedema, or fibrin, interstitial pneumonia, periarteriolar oedema or inflammation, and peribronchial or peribronchiolar inflammation.

For measurements on Picrosirius Red-stained sections, and DAB stain in ASMA, and DC-LAMP immunostained sections sample size was considered acceptable if the standard error for measurements fell below 5% of the mean value for that measurement. In the six sections where this condition was not met, the standard error ranged from 5.0 to 7.3% of the mean.

In contrast, in radio-exposed lung, DC-LAMP expressing cells were frequently found close together in linearly arranged clusters (Fig. 6; panels (b) and (c)). Whilst the areas between such clusters were largely devoid of the regular array of expression seen in the control lung, when cells were identified at the intersection of neighbouring alveolar walls, they appeared larger than those seen in the control lung sections.

DC-LAMP +ve cells from castrated male sheep (793 \u03bcm2 [541\u20131117] median [range]) were significantly larger than those from female sheep (728 \u03bcm2 [579\u2013961]). Further analysis of DC-LAMP expression involved calculating the nearest neighbour distances (NND) for positive-staining cells in each field. The boxplot in Fig. 7d depicts this metric. Two-way ANOVA (Table 1) indicated a significant lung effect (P = 0.000), a non-significant treatment effect (P = 0.554) and a significant interaction between these terms (P = 0.002) indicating that the lung effect depended on what treatment the sheep had received. Radiation exposure caused a decrease in DC-LAMP NND in directly exposed lung, and pre-treatment with LAMELLASOMETM also was associated with a decrease in DC-LAMP NND in non-radio-exposed left lung (LL-Ant).",

The early appearance of alveolar septal fibrosis is not an isolated finding. Indeed, Jennings & Arden (1962) found that alveolar septal fibrosis could be seen within a month of radiation exposure35, and Bennett et al.

We believe this reflects the coarse-fractionated dose regime and the relatively small volume targeted in the present study. Indeed it has previously been shown that sheep will develop radiation pneumonitis typical of that seen in humans given sufficient dose and lung volume targeted37\u201341. Unilateral single fraction high dose irradiation (30 Gy) of the sheep thorax produced radiation pneumonitis typical of the syndrome in humans at 4 weeks after irradiation41, and whole lung single fraction irradiation (15 Gy) of sheep resulted in the development of progressive dyspnoea three weeks after exposure; however animals were killed at 4 weeks precluding longer term assessment38. Some parallels and contrasts between these previous reports and our own experience are apparent. Guerry-force et al.40 also described interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema, interstitial accumulation of mononuclear cells, and epithelial injury to type I and II pneumocytes, but they found no evidence of interstitial fibrosis up to four weeks after exposure40. Considering our results and existing data, our conclusion is that sheep replicate many aspects of the early human response to lung irradiation, and that substantial pathology develops in sheep subjected to a radiotherapy regime (30 Gy/5F/2 wk), which bears resemblance to hypofractionated regimens routinely applied to patients with metastatic lung cancer, and some patients with locally advanced disease42. Our primary goal in this particular model was not to create clinical illness but rather to reproducibly irradiate a region of lung amenable to serial diagnostic sampling in which to assess the impact of an aerosolized synthetic drug.",

            "text": "Alveolar fibrosis was a feature of the early pulmonary response to radiation in sheep pre-treated with saline. Alveolar mesenchymal fibroblasts are responsible for producing tropocollagen, the molecular component of collagen fibres, and the ground substance that fills the spaces between the cells and various fibres in the interstitial space. A particular population of differentiated fibroblasts comprise the myofibroblasts which are characterised by their expression of ASMA, as well as their ability to contract in a smooth muscle cell-like manner. Myofibroblasts play a fundamental role in alveologenesis50. In healthy lung sections ASMA expression is recognised at the tips of secondary septal crests, representing the cross-sectioned ridges running between the alveoli surrounding the alveolar ducts. The structure of the alveolar interstitial matrix is significantly compromised following radiation exposure. Central among the growth factors that co-ordinate matrix tissue re-modelling is TGF-\u03b2. This growth factor, which is ubiquitously expressed by all cells and tissues within the body, promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by stimulating different collagen, elastin, fibronectin and proteoglycan genes to produce ECM components. In addition to physical influences such as acidification or temperature changes TGF-\u03b2 can be activated by proteases, by reactive oxygen species, or by interacting with thrombospondin or the \u03b1v-containing integrins (\u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28). Activated TGF-\u03b2 can then interact with its receptors leading to phosphorylation of transcription factors Smad2 and/or Smad3 which in turn associate and form a complex with Smad4 before translocating to the nucleus to influence the transcription of target genes and the production of ECM components. In a rat model of radiation-induced lung injury, protein expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b26, TGF-\u03b21, T\u03b2RII, Smad3, and p-Smad2/3 was undetectable in the normal alveolar epithelium but increased in association with lung fibrosis six months after radiation exposure51. We opine that similar mechanisms are likely to be evoked in the context of the present model following sufficient time for fibrosis to be chronic and active, and this is an ongoing focus of our research.",

A similar relationship is described in patients with pulmonary fibrosis52,53 and the implication arises that the ASMA-expressing myofibroblasts are also responsible for the increased production of collagen. This widely-held opinion has been recently challenged by evidence from a mouse model54 in which ASMA-directed deletion of \u03b1v integrins did not prevent lung fibrosis in a bleomycin mouse model, suggesting that other subpopulations of fibroblasts that don\u2019t express ASMA (the majority) contribute to the integrin-mediated TGF\u03b2 activation and collagen production in this model. Other examples of increased ASMA expression in sheep lung include chronic lymphoid interstitial pneumonia in maedi-visna, a disease caused by the lentivirus maedi-visna virus (MVV) and characterised by lymphoid hyperplasia, hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells, alveolitis and fibrosis29,55\u201358, and mechanical ventilation-induced stretch injury in foetal sheep59.

(1974) suggested that the presence of contractile interstitial cells in the alveolar wall might indicate that the alveoli themselves participate in the autoregulation of ventilation and perfusion60. Simple models of lung parenchyma at the acinar level have surface tension at the air-liquid interface on alveolar septa pulling the alveolar ducts radially outward, an effect counterbalanced by tissue forces (collagen, elastin and smooth muscle) in the alveolar entrance rings pulling the ducts radially inward61. The balance between these elements contributes to pressure\u2013volume and geometric hysteresis during breathing62, and hence gas mixing and deposition in the pulmonary acinus. It is tempting to speculate that the increase in ASMA expression seen after radiation exposure is compensation for an increase in surface tension brought about by an impaired surfactant system.",

            "text": "Our analysis of DC-LAMP expression found that radiation exposure was associated with clustering and an increase in size of DC-LAMP-positive cells. Type II pneumocytes proliferate in response to injury and serve as progenitors for replacing lost or damaged type I pneumocytes lining the alveolar surface63,64. More recently it has been shown that adult, differentiated type I cells can themselves self-renew and give rise to type II cells65. Whilst some limited concordance between DC-LAMP and Ki67 staining did exist in the hyperplastic foci this was not a consistent finding and indeed it was perhaps surprising that evidence of proliferation was so scant in these areas. Type II cells are well-recognised to be early susceptible targets of radiation effects and we found that their reduced presence in their normal niches at alveolar corners was associated with an increase in size of the remaining cells found in these sites; altered timing of samples may provide additional information as to the role and period of post-radiation injury and proliferation. Whether the hypertrophy reflects perturbed or compensatory increase in function is unknown. Further, the mechanistic association between localised clusters of hyperplasia and the diffuse loss of type II pneumocytes is not intuitive. Whilst hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes is frequently observed in pathologic states66, these cells have also been described as the \u201cdefender of the alveolus\u201d67, with their dysfunction lying at the heart of interstitial lung disease. Indeed, selective injury mediated through delivery of diphtheria toxin to transgenic mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor on these cells induced diffuse interstitial collagen deposition with patchy areas of more confluent scarring and associated alveolar contraction68. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but may reflect a homeostatic role for type II pneumocytes in the healthy lung. Recent evidence supports this notion as lung epithelial cells produce the anti-fibrotic mediator prostaglandin E2, which can mitigate the influence of TGF-beta69. Alternatively, type II pneumocytes can play an important role in mediating the pro-fibrotic influence of TGF-beta70. Li and colleagues (2011) demonstrated that loss of TGF-beta receptor signalling in these cells protected against bleomycin-induced fibrosis by inducing epithelial apoptosis, decreasing myofibroblast activation, and preventing a protease imbalance70. Senescence may also play a significant contribution to chronic lung injury following radiation. In a murine model of radiation-induced fibrosis, type II pneumocyte senescence occurred in a time and dose-dependent fashion following whole thorax irradiation, which was thought to reduce the stem cell compartment71. There is a complex set of pro-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and mitogenic cytokines that comprise the secretory profile of senescence (SASP), including TGF-\u03b21, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 that have implications on RILI72,73. In a more recent murine study of radiation-induced lung fibrosis, rapamcyin effectively mitigated type II pneumocyte senescence, inflammatory cytokine expression, and collagen production72. Further study is warranted to determine whether the enlarged type II pneumocytes in the present study represent cells that have undergone radiation-induced early senescence. Our novel observation that DC-LAMP +ve cells from castrated male sheep were significantly larger than those from female sheep deserves further investigation to validate and explore the underpinning mechanisms.",

Alternatively, or in addition, LAMELLASOMETM may act more specifically to preserve type II cell function and the role of this cell in \u2018managing\u2019 the underlying interstitium. In support of a proposed type II cell effect LAMELLASOMETM pre-treatment did significantly increase the number of DC-LAMP positive cells in the lung relative to sheep pre-treated with saline, which contributed to a non-significant trend (P = 0.067) towards an increase in the DC-LAMP area percentage. LAMELLASOMETM, in influencing the ability of type II cells to manage the interstitium, may subsequently decrease the proportion of myofibroblasts in this compartment in health, which would explain the significant treatment effect on ASMA.

Notably, in almost all of these reports the radioprotectant was delivered either systemically or orally. In the context of protecting the lung, aerosol delivery potentially allows the use of smaller doses that target more rapidly, and consequently avoid systemic side-effects.

As conceptual mechanisms for such unilateral lung effects are not obvious we hypothesised that the proximity of the anterior blocks to the cranial margin of the PTV might be a factor in dictating this difference between the treatment groups. Our strategy for selecting these anterior blocks was as follows: The block containing the cranial margin of the PTV was identified. Progressing cranially, its immediate neighbour was disregarded and the next block along selected as LL (or RL)_Ant. As this procedure was consistent it was assumed that any variation in the spatial relationship between the selected blocks and the cranial margin of the PTV would be randomly spread between the saline and LAMELLASOMETM groups. However, when we retrospectively examined these distances we discovered that there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the distance of the \u201cAnt\u201d section from the cranial margin of the PTV \u2013 the LAMELLASOMETM sections were approximately 7 mm closer (data not shown). Further, when the relationship between LL_Ant and RL_Ant DC-LAMP NND and Ki67 cell counts was expressed as absolute difference (LL-RL), and fold-change (1 + ((LL-RL)/RL) respectively, and compared to the distance of the section from the cranial edge of the PTV, significant correlations were found which would appear to explain the observation that pre-treatment with LAMELLASOMETM was associated with a decrease in DC-LAMP NND and an increase in Ki67 count in non-radio-exposed left lung (data not shown). This suggests a ramped decline in the biological effect of radiation (at least in terms of DC-LAMP cell clustering and cell proliferation) that extends beyond the margins of the PTV in this model. As lung is a heterogeneous structure and photons are most predictable when traversing through solid tissue, these changes likely reflect the radiation \u201cscatter\u201d to adjacent lung or bystander effects, thus creating a dose-gradient immediately cranial to the PTV.",

The area of dark red pleural discolouration which reflects the margins of the PTV was clearly evident in all the lungs. Whilst there was no substantial difference in the gross appearance of the lungs from each group there was clearly some sheep to sheep variation in the nature and extent of the radiation-induced discolouration.",

The borders between areas of oedema and aerated lung were often sharply demarcated (b) (scale bar 1 mm). Perivascular oedema was also recognised (c) (scale bar 100 \u03bcm). Panels (d\u2013f) photomicrographs of picrosirius red-stained sections highlighting collagen deposition. Panels (e) and (f) are section images from radio-exposed lung (scale bars 100 and 50 \u03bcm respectively) and (d) from the contralateral control lung (scale bar 100 \u03bcm). Radiation exposure was associated with an increase in the area percentage of collagen. Panels (g\u2013i) photomicrographs highlighting the expression of ASMA in radio-exposed lung (h and i, scale bars 250 and 50 \u03bcm respectively), and from the contralateral control lung (g) (scale bar 250 \u03bcm). ASMA expression in the non-radio-exposed lung was sparse and found in association with the alveolar ducts, both at the septal tips and in the alveolar walls. Radiation exposure led to an increase in ASMA expression in these areas.",

Blocks derived from the posterior volume of the left lung lay within the PTV and were directly exposed to radiation, whilst blocks derived from the anterior volume lay proximal to the cranial margins of the PTV and should not have been directly exposed to radiation. Equally blocks from the right lung were identified as contralateral controls for the left lung samples.

Panels (a) and (b) are photomicrographs of sections immunostained to depict DC-LAMP expression from radio-exposed (b) and non-radio-exposed (a) contralateral control lung (scale bar 100 \u03bcm). In control lung DC-LAMP was expressed by rounded cells in the alveolar corners assumed to be type II pneumocytes. These cells were evenly spaced throughout the distal lung parenchyma. In radio-exposed lung clusters of DC-LAMP-expressing cells could be clearly identified lining the walls of alveoli, with a concomitant reduction in expression in the alveolar region (not shown). Where clusters of DC-LAMP expressing cells could be identified (c), we assessed whether these cells were proliferating by immunostaining neighbouring serial sections (d) to depict the expression of Ki67 (scale bars 100 \u03bcm). In many instances the clusters of DC-LAMP expression were not associated with obvious cell proliferation. Indeed, the photomicrographs from serial sections in panels (e) depicting DC-LAMP expression (scale bar 100 \u03bcm), and (f) depicting Ki67 expression (scale bar 100 \u03bcm) illustrate the sometimes concordance between DC-LAMP and Ki67 expression (*), and the fact that DC-LAMP expression can occur in the absence of Ki67 expression (o), and vice versa (#).",
