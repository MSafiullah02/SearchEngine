Houslay, 2009, Hui et al., 2013, Luck et al., 2012, te Velthuis et al., 2011). Using hidden Markov models to identify sequence profiles, the Pfam database reports 247 human PDZ domains (Table S1) (El-Gebali et al., 2019). Conversely, the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) database reports 666 human proteins containing 1101 PDZ domains (Schultz et al., 1998). However, the SMART database includes alternatively spliced protein isoforms as distinct entries, leading to considerable redundancy. UniProt (the Universal Protein Resource) avoids redundancy by clustering isoforms, and 'crowdsources' domain identification by combining information from Pfam, SMART and the PROSITE database, identifying a total of 274 human PDZ domains in 155 proteins (Table S1) (UniProt Consortium, 2019, UniProt Consortium, 2012).",

In order to determine the exact number of human PDZ domains, we used our knowledge of the conserved structure of this domain. The first structure to be determined was that of the third PDZ domain of PSD-95, using X-ray crystallography (Doyle et al., 1996). Doyle et al. used the rat sequence in their study; however, the only difference between the human and rat sequences is a single amino-acid substitution, V328I. This structure and many others highlight the characteristic fold of PDZ domains, which are typically 80\u2013100 residues in length, and contain a core of 5 \u03b2-strands (\u03b2A-\u03b2E) and 2\u03b1\u2013helices (\u03b1A and \u03b1B) (Lee and Zheng, 2010, Ponting, 1997). The exact number of secondary structure elements in PDZ domains can be higher (e.g., TIP-1 [PDB entry code: 4SFJ], USH1C-1 [3KIR], and MPDZ-13 [2FNE]).",

We also took into consideration whether or not a putative domain contains the conserved carboxylate-binding loop sequence. Of the domains listed by UniProt, 274 contain all required secondary structure elements. However, the carboxylate-binding loop sequence is missing in first PDZ domain of the FERM and PDZ domain-containing protein 2B pseudogene, FRP2L, suggesting that it is not a canonical PDZ domain. In addition, CNIPF is a fusion protein of CNKR3 and IPCEF1, and its PDZ domain sequence is 100% identical with that of CNKR3. Therefore, in analogy to the splice variants mentioned above, we do not consider this to be a unique occurrence of this PDZ domain. Finally, structural alignments identified two candidate PDZ domains that are flagged as distinct in the UniProt list, each representing the second PDZ domain in one of the two Golgi reassembly-stacking proteins GORS1 and GORS2. Although the overall fold is intact, structural data previously revealed a very unusual secondary structure layout, in that the \u03b2A and \u03b2B strands are at the C-terminal end of the domain, connected to the \u03b2E strand (Truschel et al., 2012, Truschel et al., 2011). These PDZ domains show the highest structural similarity to prokaryotic PDZ domains, and reflect an example of circular permutation, whereby the C-terminus of a protein is shifted, so that secondary structural elements are out-of-order (Hultqvist et al., 2013, Hultqvist et al., 2012, Truschel et al., 2011). Thus, our manually curated database includes a final total of 154 human proteins, containing 272 unique PDZ domains. The complete list of protein is reported in Table S1, along with alternative nomenclatures. PDZ domains are listed in Table 1\n, and corresponding sequences can be found in UniProt.",

The resulting tree, colored by central nodes (Fig. 1\nA), recapitulates well-established homologies, e.g., among the ZO or LIN7 family members. However, some family members show more distant relationships, such as Dlg5, which is clearly separated from the cluster containing Dlg1\u20134 (highlighted in red in Fig. 1A). Of course, whole-protein sequence alignments reflect not only identity among individual PDZ domains, but also the arrangement of multiple domains that are often found in tandem.",

In this PDZ domain tree, we chose to retain the protein branch color-coding from our whole-protein sequence tree (Fig. 1A). Here, we see that PDZ domains from a given protein family often do not cluster together. To highlight these differences, we aligned the 13 PDZ domains of MPDZ (Fig. 1C). There are two critical sequence features that suggest differences in target specificity amongst these domains, corresponding to their dispersion across the PDZome (Fig. 1B, names in red). First, the final position of the carboxylate-binding loop sequences (the \u201cGLGF\u201d motif) in the domains contain a variety of amino acids, including Met, Ile, Phe, and Leu. The identity of this amino acid determines whether or not a PDZ domain can accommodate a P0 Ile, as discussed in the next section (Amacher et al., 2013). Second, the first position of the \u03b1B helix, termed \u03b1B-1, determines P\u22122 selectivity, and the binding class of the PDZ domain. Again, in the 13 MPDZ PDZ domains we see multiple amino acids at this residue: while 7 of the domains contain a Class I-determining His, others have an Asn, Glu, Ile, or Leu at this position (Fig. 2\nC), characteristic of different class selectivity (Songyang et al., 1997, Stiffler et al., 2007).",

The domain layouts for these proteins are shown schematically in Fig. 2. The individual proteins contain as few as one and as many as 13 PDZ domains. Structures are available for just over half of the collective total of 50 PDZ domains. The central panel in Fig. 3\nshows Ca traces for these 26 available PDZ structures following least-squares superposition of the \u03b2B strand and \u03b1B helix onto the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 11 (ARHGB) domain. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values are all less than <1.4 \u00c5, independent of binding-motif designation. Areas of tight clustering correspond to the conserved architecture of the domain core around the peptide-binding cleft, in contrast to regions of high structural variability encoded in loop regions. In the surrounding panels, ribbon diagrams for the individual domains are clustered by protein of origin and colored by RMSD of the superposition, permitting visualization of individual adaptations.",

            "text": "PDZ domains are peptide-recognition modules that bind to SLiMs, usually engaging with the extreme C-terminus of target proteins (Davey et al., 2012, Edwards et al., 2012, Ernst et al., 2009). PDZ domains directly interact in a conserved manner with up to 10 residues in a shallow binding cleft, the core of which is comprised of the \u03b2B strand and \u03b1B helix (Fig. 3, central panel) (Doyle et al., 1996). Some PDZ domains can recognize internal sequences, for example the Wnt signaling protein Dishevelled (Dvl)\u2019s interaction with its target, the membrane-bound receptor Frizzled (Fz) (Nourry et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2003). Structural analysis revealed that Dvl is able to recognize internal ligand sequences, in addition to C-termini, due to inherent domain flexibility (Zhang et al., 2009). Internal binding motifs have been identified for a number of other PDZ domains, for example, in nNOS, PTP-BL, NHERF3, and the Drosophila melanogaster Par-6; this mode of binding may be particularly relevant in regulating GPCR signaling (Cha et al., 2017, Christopherson et al., 1999, Cuppen et al., 1998, Dunn and Ferguson, 2015, Harris et al., 2001, Lemaire and McPherson, 2006, London et al., 2004, Paasche et al., 2005, Penkert et al., 2004). In all cases, the internal motif forms a \u03b2-finger structure that forms an additional strand of the PDZ core antiparallel \u03b2-sheet, analogous to a C-terminal ligand (Paasche et al., 2005, Penkert et al., 2004). A structural example of this mode of binding can be seen in PDB accession code 1X8S of the D. melanogaster Par-6 PDZ domain bound to a peptide derived from PALS1 (Penkert et al., 2004). In addition, some PDZ domains have been shown to bind non-peptide ligands (e.g., phosphoinositides; see e.g., Ivarsson et al., 2013). Although potentially important physiologically, these non-canonical interactions are not a focus of this review.",

Concurrently, this makes it difficult to identify ligand-bound PDZ domain structures by sequence-gazing or the number of protein chains in a PDB entry. We identified 170 peptide-bound domain structures (underlined in Table S2 are structures that include co-crystallized peptides plus selected structures with lattice contacts that mimic canonical interactions), or 33% of the unique domain structures. At least one peptide-bound structure is available for 57 of the 271 PDZ domains. At the same time, we acknowledge that this is likely to represent a lower bound on the number of PDZ domains with structurally resolved binding interactions due to the previous statement about lattice interactions. Of the identified structures, there are also several that contain small-molecule ligands, which are not highlighted explicitly in the table.",

For example, there is an overall RMSD of 0.9 \u00c5 between the PSD-95 PDZ3 \u03b1-carbon positions in the first peptide-bound and the corresponding peptide-free crystal structure (Doyle et al., 1996). As mentioned previously, there is a standard conformation adopted by the C-terminal residues in most peptide ligands, in which the peptide forms an additional strand of the core \u03b2 sheet (Fig. 4\nA). In addition, the main-chain terminal carboxylate group interacts with a conserved binding loop encoded by the \u201cGLGF repeats\u201d that Cho et al. had initially discovered as a major determinant of PDZ domain identity (Fig. 4B) (Cho et al., 1992, Ponting, 1997). Because of the structural conservation of both binding partners, the associated main-chain hydrogen bonds provide a shared baseline contribution to the thermodynamics of PDZ-peptide interactions.",

Here, a motif residue is defined by a preference for no more than four amino acids at a particular position relative to the C-termini of the ligands of a given domain. Notably, Tonikian et al. defined 16 distinct binding classes, dependent on the P0 and P\u22122 positions, as well as additional motif residues up to the P\u22126 position (Tonikian et al., 2008, Tonikian et al., 2007). These investigators successfully expressed and purified 88 human PDZ domains (as well as 57 from C. elegans), and determined binding motifs by testing high affinity interactions using phage display analysis. These extended motifs include PDZ domains Erbin, DLG1-3, INADL-2, and others (Tonikian et al., 2008). In 2014, this group structurally analyzed PDZ domains in all of the proposed binding classes (Ernst et al., 2014). A number of studies looking at PDZ binding selectivity and motif residues at positions outside of P0 and P\u20132 are reviewed in Luck et al. (Luck et al., 2012). Notably however, Tonikian et al., as well as ourselves, continue to find a number of PDZ domains with a Class I-III degenerate motif, for example CAL, NHERF1, PTPN13-2, and SHANK3-1 (Amacher et al., 2014, Cushing et al., 2010, Tonikian et al., 2008, Vouilleme et al., 2010).",

Our lab previously defined the non-motif residue preferences within the peptide as modulators, in that these positional preferences can modulate affinity for peptide targets (Amacher et al., 2014). These preferences are important for sequence selectivity between two PDZ domains with degenerate or closely-related binding motifs (Vouilleme et al., 2010). It is important to remember that these extended motifs and modulator preferences are designed to identify the highest affinity binding sequences for a particular PDZ domain or set of domains. However, maximum affinity is not a requirement for endogenous interactions complicating the application of motif rules in the prediction of physiologically relevant PDZ interactomes. Furthermore, C-terminal sequences in the human proteome represent an extremely sparse sampling of all possible PDZ-binding sequences.",

Although in the PDZ domains of PSD95 this sequence is GLGF, alignments soon identified variability in these residues (Ponting, 1997, Ponting and Phillips, 1995). In our hands, sequence alignments of PDZ domain sequences can misidentify the carboxylate-binding loop sequence.

Analysis of the stereochemical basis of this absence, using structures of CAL (PDB ID: 4E34, X = Gly), Erbin (1N7T, X = Glu), HtrA1 (2JOA, X = Tyr), HtrA3 (2P3W, X = Phe), TIP-1 (4SFJ, X = Ile), Tiam1 (3KZE, X = Thr), and Scrib1 (2W4F, X = Glu), revealed that in silico mutagenesis resulted in clashes with either the peptide or residues in the \u03b2A\u2013\u03b2B loop in all instances except HtrA1. These results support work from our group and others that investigated the stereochemical basis of P0 selectivity amongst PDZ domains that share a binding motif (Amacher et al., 2013, Appleton et al., 2006). The third residue is almost always a Gly, with three exceptions: CAR11 and CAR14 (Gln) and LNX1-1 (Ser) (Fig. 6, Table S3). We found that the identity of the \u03a61 and \u03a62 residues of the carboxylate-binding loop directly influence P0 residue selectivity (Amacher et al., 2013).",

Previous work strongly indicates PDZ domains and their cellular targets co-evolved; where this has occurred, binding preferences are effectively hard-wired into the PDZ domain itself (Ernst et al., 2009, Kaneko et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2012, McLaughlin et al., 2012). Specifically, Ernst et al. found that by varying 10 binding site positions on the Erbin PDZ domain using phage display, they were able to generate variants with binding diversity comparable to that of the human PDZ family, including 7 specificity clusters not yet found in nature (Ernst et al., 2009). In addition, McLaughlin et al. used a bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) system to mutate each residue in the PSD95-PDZ3 domain to each of the other proteogenic amino acids and then to investigate quantitatively how these variants affect ligand binding. They report that 20 out of 81 total sites on the PSD-95 PDZ3 domain functionally affect binding via multiple cooperation networks between residues (McLaughlin et al., 2012). On a PDZome-wide scale, the holdup assay provides a high-throughput technique to quantitate peptide binding to almost the full complement of human PDZ domains. This experimental assay uses microfluidic capillary electrophoresis to measure binding affinities of 266 recombinantly produced human PDZ domains, as well as 87 tandem domains, with peptide-coated resins, measuring up to 1000 binding affinities per day (Duhoo et al., 2019, Vincentelli et al., 2015).",

Smith and Kortemme, 2010, Zaslavsky et al., 2010). Indeed, one of the hallmarks of organismal complexity is the expansion of the number of PDZ domains and the rewiring of their interactions (Chimura et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2012, Sakarya et al., 2010). Underscoring the target flexibility achievable by residue substitutions in PDZ domains, Teyra et al. recently found that only 3 mutations were sufficient to describe the specificity-switching between Erbin and Pdlim4 PDZ domains, suggesting that only extremely short evolutionary pathways were necessary to introduce complexity into this protein family (Teyra et al., 2019).",

            "text": "The published literature includes hundreds of papers that report binding affinities for PDZ domains and their target sequences. Likely this is due, at least in part, to the relative ease of expressing and purifying many of these small modular domains, as well as the ability to synthesize binding peptides. The most common techniques used to determine PDZ binding affinities are fluorescence polarization (FP) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Frostell et al., 2013, Rossi and Taylor, 2011). Importantly, FP is a solution-based technique that utilizes a fluorescent tag, which can influence binding, while SPR requires one partner of the complex, either the peptide or PDZ domain, to be fixed to a surface. As a result, SPR may be subject to avidity effects for multivalent complexes, and many early measurements reported inaccurate values of PDZ domain binding, generating artificial values in the low nanomolar range (Cushing et al., 2008). Previous work from our lab obtained concordant values for the affinity of NHERF1-1 for a CFTR C-terminal decamer (TEEEVQDTRL) using FP (K\nI = 597 nM) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (K\nD = 787 nM), whereas SPR yielded a much higher-affinity interaction (K\nD = 10.3 nM), consistent with previously published work (see asterisks in Fig. 7\nA). This discrepancy most likely reflects SPR surface avidity effects and appears to be particularly problematic when the peptide is immobilized as the surface ligand, rather than the protein domain (Cushing et al., 2008). In addition to these three techniques, AlphaScreen proximity assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Trp fluorescence, and additional binding assays, for example hold-up and Coomassie-stained gel-based assays, have all been used to measure binding affinities.",

Given the methodological differences described above, we performed a two-way ANOVA, taking both domain identity and methodological variation into account, and using a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s HSD test in order to evaluate the hypothesis that higher affinity peptides may be available for some domains than for others. Assuming that the selected affinities are representative, of 1540 pairwise comparisons between affinity estimates for 56 single domains, 94 showed p\nadj values <0.05. 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table S5 for the differences in estimated affinities for each of these comparisons. We then tabulated 200 affinities of engineered sequences for 12 different PDZ domains, giving greater depth of coverage to a smaller number of domains, (Table S6). We repeated the analysis and found 22 of the possible 66 pairwise comparisons of domain affinity ranges exhibited statistically significant differences, including 5 pairings seen using endogenous target affinities, and 17 new pairings (Table S7). For ease of visualization, we also performed a simplified analysis comparing peptide affinities for seven different domains, all obtained using ELISA-based assays (Fig. 7B). A one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s HSD test reveals multiple differences. For example, while the Erbin PDZ domain bound a number of peptides with affinities as low as 10 nM, the highest affinity peptide for the SCRIB PDZ3 domain was 1600 nM (padj < 0.005). We similarly find a statistically significant difference between CAL and PSD-95 PDZ2, both measured by FP (Fig. 7C). All of the phage display-derived experiments, measured with ELISA, were from the same group, whereas different labs, including ours, engineered the CAL and PSD-95 PDZ2 peptides for FP measurements (Amacher et al., 2013, Roberts et al., 2012, Runyon et al., 2007, Skelton et al., 2003, Tonikian et al., 2007, Vouilleme et al., 2010, You et al., 2006). Interestingly, even better targeting of PDZ proteins can be achieved by leveraging avidity effects and the presence of multiple domains, for example, Bach et al. reveal 10-100x stronger inhibitor binding to PSD-95 PDZs 1&2 by using a dimeric peptide, then when targeting each PDZ domain individually (Bach et al., 2012).",

For CAL, there are a number of peptide sequences that bind in the single micromolar range; however, the highest affinity endogenous sequences bind with \u226510-fold weaker affinity (Amacher et al., 2013, Cushing et al., 2008, Roberts et al., 2012).

Blocking apoptosis of cellular components, leading to uncontrolled cell growth (Javier and Rice, 2011, Lee and Laimins, 2004). In the late 1990s, researchers identified three viral oncoproteins (adenovirus type 9 E4-ORF1, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax, and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6) that contain C-terminal PDZ domain binding motifs. They also showed that these proteins target PDZ domains, such as the tumor suppressor proteins Dlg and hScrib, leading to proteasome-mediated degradation (Gardiol et al., 1999, Javier and Rice, 2011, Nakagawa and Huibregtse, 2000, Pim et al., 2012).",

The number of known viruses whose proteins target PDZ domains has also expanded dramatically to include: influenza A, rabies virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (James and Roberts, 2016, Javier and Rice, 2011, Kim et al., 2014, Shepardson et al., 2019). For example, a number of HIV proteins are known to interact with PDZ domains, including HIV-1 glycoprotein 120, which is derived from the HIV-1 glycoprotein 160 precursor (James and Roberts, 2016). Specifically, the last 5 residues of UniProt codes ENV_HV1AN, with sequence ERSLL, and ENV_HV2D2, with sequence ELTLL, differ from that of known PDZ-binding protein Myosin 15a, with sequence EITLL, by \u22642 residues, and maintain canonical PDZ binding motifs (Belyantseva et al., 2005). For reference, there are two recent reviews of known viral protein-PDZ interactions, including discussions of how viruses exploit PDZ targeting to evade the immune system (Guti\u00e9rrez-Gonz\u00e1lez and Santos-Mendoza, 2019, James and Roberts, 2016).",

            "text": "Amongst the HPV strains, 13\u201318 are termed high-risk for developing cancer (with the highest risk attributed to the HPV-16 and HPV-18 strains), all of which have PDZ binding motif-satisfying E6 proteins (Ault, 2007). The C-terminal sequences of 19 of the 65 reviewed E6 protein sequences listed in UniProt reveal canonical binding motifs. WebLogo analysis of these sequences confirms that the most prevalent residues match the HPV-18 E6 C-terminal sequence (RRETQV) (Fig. 8\n). Furthermore, this viral sequence matches the consensus sequence for protein kinase A (PKA), X-R-R-X-S/T-X. Phosphorylation of the P\u22122 Thr residue in HPV-18 has been shown to inhibit E6-induced degradation of Dlg in HEK293 cells, as well as decrease cellular growth of primary keratinocytes (Delury et al., 2013, K\u00fchne et al., 2000). It is interesting that the viral sequence has not evolved to evade this host-mediated inhibition by PKA. It suggests that in addition to motif-satisfying amino acids, the Arg residues may be important for PDZ domain targeting.",

            "text": "Understanding how PDZ domains recognize their targets and what determines binding preferences is extremely useful in engineering specific PDZ inhibitors, because each peptide-binding cleft can be treated as a pharmacophore. The interacting surface for each position is referred to as a site or socket, for example, S0 interacts with residue P0, S\u22121 with P\u22121, etc. (Amacher et al., 2014, Boucherle et al., 2011, Madsen et al., 2005). To date, inhibitor development has followed a general pipeline, as summarized in Fig. 9\n. Initially, a target is validated via cell-based experiments (e.g., Cushing et al., 2010, Wolde et al., 2007). For example, in the disease cystic fibrosis, levels of CFTR are reduced at the epithelial cell surface leading to improper hydration of the airway surface liquid and a buildup of mucus and bacterial infection in the patient (Rogan et al., 2011). The CFTR-associated ligand CAL has a PDZ domain that binds the C-terminus of CFTR, triggering its lysosomal degradation, and knockdown of CAL using siRNA reveals a robust increase in cell surface CFTR expression, as well as an increase in CFTR-mediated Cl\u2212 currents across epithelial cell monolayers (Cushing et al., 2010). In another example, knockdown of Dvl using siRNA, as well as expression of Dvl mutants, was shown to inhibit tumor growth, by disrupting the Wnt signaling pathway and transcriptional activation of \u03b2-catenin, in addition to other targets (Uematsu et al., 2003a, Uematsu et al., 2003b) (Fig. 9, top panel).",

            "text": "Following target validation, inhibitors are designed using either a peptide- or small molecule-based scaffold, and screened via a high throughput method, e.g., peptide array, phage display or high throughput screens (HTS) (Boisguerin et al., 2007, Chen et al., 2007, Cilenti et al., 2003, Cushing et al., 2010, Hammond et al., 2006, Kaneko et al., 2011, Thorsen et al., 2011, Vouilleme et al., 2010, Wiedemann et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2009). As mentioned previously, leveraging avidity effects with dimeric or trimeric inhibitors show increased affinity, and efficacy, against PDZ domain targets (Bach et al., 2012, Nissen et al., 2015). This phase involves a number of iterative rounds, optimizing selectivity and affinity for the PDZ domain of interest (Fig. 9, middle panel). As with other drugs, cellular delivery is a significant hurdle. In response, cell-penetrating peptides or delivery agents to improve methods are being actively developed (Patra et al., 2012, Piserchio et al., 2004, Tao and Johns, 2010). The advancements of PDZ domain therapeutics additionally depend on the capability to dissect the interacting networks wherein these proteins function in the cell. Therapeutic design is progressing, for example, a peptide-based PSD-95 PDZ2 inhibitor, targeting stroke and first developed in 2002, called \u201cNA-1\u201d completed Phase III clinical trials in November 2019 (Aarts et al., 2002, Ballarin and Tymianski, 2018, Christensen et al., 2019). A number of other inhibitors are at various phases of development or in preclinical studies, as comprehensively reviewed in (Christensen et al., 2019).",

            "text": "Over the next two sections of this review, we will shift our focus to the regulation of PDZ binding interactions. Outside of the peptide-binding cleft, there are a number of residues that influence target recognition. Indeed, this is due to extensive allosteric networks in PDZ domains. Lockless and Ranganathan first measured energetic couplings that included the Class I \u03b1B-1 His residue of PSD-95 PDZ3, residues throughout the core of the protein, and the \u03b1A helix, in 1999 (Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999). This type of pathway is defined as a sector, or a \u201csparse network of physically contiguous and coevolving amino acids\u201d (Reynolds et al., 2011). After mutating all 39 surface-exposed residues on PSD-95 PDZ3 to all other proteogenic amino acids, 11 residues were found to have significant effects on CRIPT ligand binding, with 10 of these being sector connected (Reynolds et al., 2011). Overall, it is clear that allosteric effects are major determinants of PDZ binding interactions (Gautier et al., 2018, Karlsson et al., 2016, Kumawat and Chakrabarty, 2019, Kumawat and Chakrabarty, 2017, Murciano-Calles et al., 2014, Raman et al., 2016). For a broad discussion of inter- and intracellular communication pathways in protein signaling domains, including PDZ domains, see a number of reviews (Gautier et al., 2018, Karlsson et al., 2016, Smock and Gierasch, 2009).",

There is also evidence of an effect of residues in the \u03b2D-\u03b2E loop, \u03b1A-\u03b2D loop, and the \u03b1C helix of PSD95 PDZ3, suggesting that almost all of the loops and secondary structure elements of a PDZ domain can contribute to binding selectivity (Fig. 10) (Feng et al., 2002, Gianni et al., 2011, Petit et al., 2009). Mutation of these sites can reduce ligand affinity up to 21-fold, suggesting additional target binding surfaces for therapeutic development. Indeed, a covalent allosteric inhibitor weakens peptide-binding affinity of the CAL PDZ domain via modification of a Cys residue located outside of the peptide-binding cleft (Zhao et al., 2018).",

Lipid-binding characteristics of PDZ domains have long been studied (e.g., refs. Das et al., 2003, Kachel et al., 2003, Wu et al., 2007, Zimmermann et al., 2002). A computational and experimental study by Chen et al. suggests that approximately 30% of human PDZ domains bind lipids, with 2 distinct modes of binding that can affect ligand affinity, either positively or negatively (Chen et al., 2012). These interactions are selective, and dependent on lipid head group. Of the interactions measured experimentally, most are in the nanomolar range (the authors used 1 \u03bcM as a cutoff to determine \u201cbinding\u201d versus \u201cnon-binding\u201d), and the tightest interaction was for NHERF1 PDZ1, at 24 nM (Chen et al., 2012).

Here, we will focus on phosphorylation, which is the most well-studied and which often disrupts PDZ domain:target interactions both within and outside the peptide-binding cleft. A group of papers published in 2002 identified phosphorylation of the C-termini of potassium channel Kir5.1, \u03b21-adrenergic receptors, and stargazin as a mechanism for disrupting PDZ domain recognition (Chetkovich et al., 2002, Choi et al., 2002, Hu et al., 2002, Kim and Sheng, 2004, Tanemoto et al., 2002). Additional examples of C-terminal sequence modifications that regulate PDZ domain binding include the phosphorylation of Ser880 in the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 by protein kinase C (PKC), of potassium channel Kir2.3 by protein kinase A (PKA), and of the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5, GRK5 (Cao et al., 1999, Chung et al., 2000, Cohen et al., 1996, Leonoudakis et al., 2001, Matsuda et al., 1999). These phosphorylation events directly affect binding to PDZ domains in GRIP, PSD-95, Dlg1, and NHERF1 (Kulangara et al., 2007, Narayan et al., 2009, Nelson et al., 2013, Voltz et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2012). However, these receptors are targets of additional PDZ domains, such as SNX27, TIP-1, PICK1, LIN7A-C, and CASK, and these interactions may also be affected (Perez et al., 2001, UniProt Consortium, 2019).",

Specifically, proteomic analysis of binding interactions to either a phosphorylated or unphosphorylated version of the C-terminal peptide of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1), which can be phosphorylated in response to epidermal growth factor (EGFR) signaling, revealed both enhanced and weakened affinity in the interactome of RSK1:PDZ domain interactions (G\u00f3gl et al., 2019). In addition, phage display analysis of the Scribble and DLG1 PDZ domains with unphosphorylated or phosphomimetic peptides of endogenous PDZ ligand sequences again suggest that phosphorylation is a powerful regulatory mechanism for altering PDZ binding and affinity of cellular targets (Sundell et al., 2018).",

Notably, this Ser residue is conserved in the first PDZ domain of the other Dlg proteins, including PSD-95. In addition, phosphorylation of Tyr397 in PSD-95 PDZ3 allosterically regulates its conformation and interaction with its own SH3 domain (Zhang et al., 2011a, Zhang et al., 2011b). More recently, site-specific phosphorylation of PSD-95 revealed that phosphorylation of Y397 in PSD-95 resulted in a significant increase in affinity for stargazin (Pedersen et al., 2017). Additional PDZ domains regulated via phosphorylation mechanisms include NHERF1 and PTEN (Adey et al., 2000, Hall et al., 1999).",

So far, this review has focused on characteristics of individual PDZ domains, but PDZ-mediated multivalent interactions depend on molecular recognition beyond an isolated binding event between a PDZ domain and its target. Some PDZ domain-containing proteins, like TIP-1 (TX1B3) are comprised almost entirely of a single PDZ domain; however, this is the exception not the norm. A more common feature of PDZ domain-containing proteins is the presence of multiple interaction domains, including additional PDZ domains (Fig. 2, Table S1) (Kelil and Michnick, 2019, Kim and Sheng, 2004, Lee and Zheng, 2010, Nourry et al., 2003, Ye and Zhang, 2013). The coordination of these modules in multivalent interactions is important for molecular recognition, directly regulating the local concentration of components (Albertazzi et al., 2013). Multivalency in signaling proteins also creates macromolecular complexes with different physical and chemical properties than those at the single-molecule scale (Kelil and Michnick, 2019, Li et al., 2012).",

The PDZ protein connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras isoform 3 (CNKR3) acts as an important regulatory signal by scaffolding the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) which is crucial for proper Na+/K+ balance. CNKR3 also scaffolds the serine-threonine kinase SGK1 and ENaC inhibitor Nedd4-2, in a >1 MDa complex which plays an important role in Na+ homeostasis (Soundararajan et al., 2012). In the post-synaptic density of neurons, perhaps the most well-studied example, the PDZ domain-containing Shank proteins act as molecular bridges between the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and the actin cytoskeleton (Kim and Sheng, 2004, Sheng and Kim, 2000, Vessey and Karra, 2007).

Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines, with distances (from bottom-to-top) of 2.7 \u00c5, 3.0 \u00c5, and 3.0 \u00c5. (B) The carboxylate moiety of the P0 residue in APC interacts directly with the amides of the DLG1-1 \u201cGLGF\u201d motif (stick model; cyan carbon atoms). Hydrogen bond (dashed lines) are shown, with lengths from left-to-right of 2.9 \u00c5 and 3.3 \u00c5. (C) Interactions of the PDZ domain with the P\u22122 residue historically determine binding class, and conserved features are shown for Classes I (DLG1-1, hydrogen bond, 3.0 \u00c5), II (TIAM1, interacting residue in green sticks colored by heteroatom), and III (NOS, interacting residue in pink sticks colored by heteroatom; hydrogen bond, 2.9 \u00c5) PDZ domains. PDB codes are: DLG1-1 (3RL7), TIAM1 (3KZE), NOS1 (1B8Q). For all, heteroatoms are colored by atom type (O = red and N = blue).

(A) The C-terminal sequence of CFTR (VQDTRL) is shown as a barcode, meaning each residue is represented by a unique pattern of lines with varying thickness. Only motif residues are displayed in the left panel vs. all residues in the right panel. The colors correspond to the stereochemical nature of each residue: positively charged residues are blue, negatively charged residues are red, hydrophobic residues are yellow, and polar residues (including glycine) are green). Motif positions are shown as uppercase letters. (B) Additional common Class I (top panels) and Class II (bottom panels) PDZ binding targets are shown: HPV16 E6 (RRETQL), NMDA receptor subunit GluN2A (SIESDV), whirlin (WHRN, EFNVML), and receptor tyrosine-protein kinases erbB-2 (ERBB2, GLDVPV), are highlighted. The barcode analogy emphasizes that even similar sequences, particularly of the same binding class, can contain varied position-specific chemical and physical properties.

(A) We compiled a sampling of previously reported binding affinities for sequences derived from endogenous binding partners (Table S4), measured using a variety of techniques (e.g., FP, SPR, ITC). Statistical comparisons reveal a difference in affinity estimates associated with AlphaScreen compared to the other techniques. Avidity effects can affect measurements using non-solution-based techniques, such as AlphaScreen, but also ELISA and SPR, depending on how the experiment is performed. For example, affinity values were estimated in parallel using different techniques for NHERF1-1 binding to CFTR and are marked with red circles on the FP (KD = 597 nM), ITC (KD = 787 nM), and SPR (KD = 10.3 nM) bars. (B, C) Experimental binding affinities were also compiled for high affinity engineered interactors (Table S6). (B) Comparisons among sequences developed using phage display, reveal that these proteins bind to their optimized sequences with a different range of affinities.
