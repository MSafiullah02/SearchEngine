ACE2 receptor is mainly distributed in type II alveolar cells (AT2 cell) in the lung tissues. Therefore, the primary target organ of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body is the lung [3] , the primary presentation of patients include respiratory tract symptoms, such as cough, fever, and dyspnea [2] . About 50% of patients with severe cases of COVID-19 (age > 60 years; lung or cardiovascular disease) develop dyspnea one week after the onset of the disease, which can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, difficult-to-correct metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and even death [4] . Patients with severe dyspnea have increased lung lesions with larger extent in advanced stages, involving multiple lung lobes, and some cases exhibit the 'white lung'. These are primarily consolidation opacities together with ground-glass opacities and are often accompanied by multiple linear opacities and air bronchograms [5] . Therefore, sudden or exacerbated dyspnea in the clinic often indicates an increase in lung lesions and further aggravation of the disease.",

These symptoms are severe in these patients; however, the lesions in the lung observed during CT are different from the common and extensive consolidation opacities and large number of ground-glass opacities. Instead, the lesions primarily manifested as inflammatory changes in the bilateral and respiratory bronchioles. Use of short-time and low-dose corticosteroid could rapidly attenuate the chest tightness and dyspnea symptoms.

During the onset, she was admitted to a square-cabin hospital in Wuhan for treatment. She experienced night sweats, fever, cough, and expectoration of a small amount of white sputum. After treatment, her symptoms eased, she showed improvement on her chest CT, and she was discharged. On February 22, chest distress and shortness of breath, which was exacerbated by activity, reappeared. Therefore, she was admitted to the hospital again. She complained of right-sided back pain but had no chills, fever, cough, sputum, haemoptysis, or joint pain. Normal diet was tolerated, sleep was poor, and urination and defecation were normal. There was no significant weight loss. The patient was previously healthy and had no underlying disease.

Our second patient had obvious chest distress at admission. Chest CT on 20 January revealed reduced extent of the lung lesions. Chest distress resolved after seven days, but diffuse chest lesions appeared during chest CT re-examination on 27 January in the absence of chest distress. The apparent deviation between clinical symptoms and chest CT findings was confusing. We know that chest distress and dyspnea are affected by several factors including cardiovascular and hematological diseases. Both patients were young women without previous histories of cardiovascular or hematological diseases. Examination of the cardiovascular and hematologic systems at admission did not reveal any abnormalities. It was clear that chest distress and dyspnea were due to respiratory system involvement.",

In the second case, chest CT on 20 February also showed a thickened bronchial tube wall and a slightly enlarged lumen. This definitively demonstrated that the bronchioles were affected in both patients during the development and progression of the disease. In addition, we observed in our clinical practice that a large number of (Fig. 3) . Based on the 'Radiological Diagnosis of New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonitis: Expert Recommendation from the Chinese Society of Radiology (First edition)' published by the Chinese Society of Radiology of the Chinese Medical Association [6] , the present study further showed that air bronchograms often appear in consolidation opacities, the bronchial walls were thickened, and the bronchi were distended locally during novel coronavirus pneumonia. Our observations indicated that bronchi with thickened walls and luminal expansion are not necessarily a part of the lesion opacities.

            "text": "Extensive respiratory tract inflammation may be associated disorders caused by inflammatory factors. Our first patient admitted had a TNF-\u03b1 level of 44.87 pg/mL, which was much higher than normal (\ufffd5.5 pg/ mL). TNF-\u03b1 is a polypeptide factor secreted by immune cells (mainly macrophages) in our body. It can induce the synthesis of acute phase proteins and mediate endotoxin and tissue injury in the inflammatory and stress responses [7] . In addition, TNF-\u03b1 has important immunoregulatory effects, such as activating neutrophils to kill pathogenic microorganisms, stimulating monocytes and other cells to produce IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and other cytokines, and activating T and B cells to produce antibodies [8] . TNF-\u03b1 may be involved in the chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract. The second possible cause may be related to the migration of lymphocytes to the tracheobronchial lesions. In our second patient, the cellular immunity panel at admission showed a significant decrease in CD3, CD4, and CD8 levels. After treatment, the CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells returned to normal. Meanwhile, our previous clinical observations suggested that the decrease in these T-lymphocytes was mainly due to the chemotactic accumulation of these cells at the site of COVID-19 lung inflammation and their resulting depletion [9] . Therefore, we believe that the bilateral bronchial inflammation in the second patient may be associated with lymphocyte accumulation in bronchial lesions. Our observations showed that the mechanism that underlies chest distress or dyspnea, which is inconsistent with lung lesions observed on CT images in patients with COVID-19 whose lung lesions are difficult to explain, may be due to the involvement of the air conduction system, such as the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. This may also explain why younger patients with mild lesions on lung imaging may have increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide on the arterial blood gas test. Apparently, inflammation of the bilateral air conduction system caused insufficient pulmonary ventilation, leading to dyspnea and chest distress. This also explains why these patients had reduced symptoms of chest distress after receiving oxygen and low-dose hormone therapy. This further indicated that the use of short-term hormone therapy in patients with common cases of COVID-19 with chest distress and dyspnea as the main symptoms is reasonable and that this therapy should not be limited to patients with severe cases.",
