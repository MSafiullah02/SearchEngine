Clinical data on comorbidities, daily vital signs and details of drugs, oxygen and ventilatory therapies were all manually abstracted from the medical records by clinical staff using a standardized data entry form for all hospitals. Comorbidities were defined to include COPD, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accident, active cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic liver disease. CXRs were retrospectively scored by \u2018blinded\u2019 radiologists in accordance with a 5\u2010point scale for each of the six lung zones (zero for zero lung opacification, 1 for 1\u201325%, 2 for 26\u201350%, 3 for 51\u201375% and 4 for 76\u2013100%), summating to a range of 0\u201324 score points.\n15\n Radiographic scorings were confined to five milestones: at presentation, commencement of ribavirin treatment if any, commencement of pulse steroid treatment if any, peak lung opacification and prior to death/discharge. The presenting laboratory and radiological readings represented the first reading within 5 days of admission, or for inpatients with hospital\u2010acquired SARS, of symptom onset; for studied time\u2010points other than at presentation, the readings were chosen based on the following priority order: current day, 1 day before and 1 day after. This central database was intensively verified and cleaned by a team of clinical staff directly supervised by the authors. Where necessary, the clinical data were cross\u2010checked with the in\u2010charge clinician(s) and/or with the patients\u2019 medical records.",

Day 7 LDH, but not presenting or day 10 LDH, was a significant prognosticator of death but not of oxygenation failure. In another earlier study, the high LDH found in SARS patients had been attributed to the release of LDH isoenzyme 1 (LD1) by blood erythrocytes rather than by the myocardium.\n11\n Although one could postulate that lysis of blood erythrocytes was the major process contributing to a high LDH level on day 7, we were unable to identify a parallel decrease in Hb. This study further confirmed that the presenting CPK is an important predictor of oxygenation failure and death, and also that the presenting ALT is a newly found prognosticator of oxygenation failure. By day 10, CPK predicted death but not oxygenation failure. All in all, at the onset of illness there appeared to be tissue injury in the liver and muscles in parallel with lung injury, and the extent of muscle injury not only predicted lung injury, but also impacted on death. By day 10, in those patients spared oxygenation failure, ongoing non\u2010lung tissue injuries, as reflected by LDH and CPK, impacted on survival.",

Both this study and the Vietnamese study\n31\n have shown that the platelet and APTT abnormalities observed during the first week of illness were usually transient. The finding of thrombocytopaenia persisting to days 7 and 10 being predictive of oxygenation failure but not of death may implicate platelet aggregation and consumptive coagulopathy in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in SARS. While ongoing endothelial damage from infection, oxygen therapy and artificial ventilation has been postulated as the mechanism for platelet fragmentation and consumption,\n32\n our time\u2010course analysis shows that thrombocytopaenia observed as early as days 7 and 10 (before intubation), was associated with eventual lung failure. Thrombocytopaenia observed during this stage of SARS is unlikely to be iatrogenic and is more likely to be a virally mediated systemic inflammatory response. The reported elevation of certain pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines in the acute illness\n34\n, \n35\n further supports a heightened role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of SARS.",

Health\u2010care facility\u2010acquired infection had a significantly lower mortality risk than community\u2010acquired infection, perhaps due to a difference in the degree of environmental contamination between the health\u2010care facility and a specific community, or to a difference in the nature, especially the duration and repetitiveness, of exposure to the infectious pathogen. Despite the current finding of a lack of difference in outcome between hospitalized patients and health\u2010care workers, much more detailed epidemiological study is required to understand the impact on the infective viral dose of specific environmental exposure, and of variations in personal infection control measures such as hand washing and use of personal protective gear.",
