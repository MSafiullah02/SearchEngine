            "text": "Hundreds of scientific papers have established that Panax ginseng has numerous clinical effects. In laboratory animals, these include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation; protection against exogenous damage from radiation, toxins, and infection; protection from physical and psychological stress; and an influence on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and immune stimulation. All of these may bear on an animal's response to stress. Recently, investigators have developed rat models of stress that have resulted in measurable physical and chemical changes. In these studies, pretreatment with ginseng attenuated the stress-induced rise in corticosterone, hyperglycemia, immune suppression, increased adrenal gland weight, gastric ulceration, and other signs of chronic stress (Rai, 2003b; Kim, 2003). The dose in rats used in one study was 100 mg/kg of ginseng root powder (Rai, 2003b). The saponin-rich fraction of ginseng also reduced the secretion of catecholamines from bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (Tachikawa, 2004).",

Most clinical studies in humans have involved upper respiratory infection and, in fact, Echinacea may shorten the duration of the common cold (Percival, 2000), depending on the form administered. Echinacea is often recommended for chronic recurrent viral upper respiratory infection in cats, and some practitioners use Echinacea to treat patients with retroviral infection. Although some practitioners caution against the long-term use of Echinacea because toxicity or autoimmune conditions may result, this concern has not been well documented. However, immunostimulants are probably best used as pulsed treatments if they are administered on a long-term basis, because full response to treatment is probably reached in a few weeks and does not continue to increase. In a 4-day observational study conducted at the Ohio Eclectic College in 1935, students were administered Echinacea before meals and at bedtime. Leukocyte counts increased 24 to 48 hours after initiation of treatment. Short-term (2- to 4-week), on-off administration is most sensible. The Echinacea monograph (see Chapter 24) describes studies in swine and horses that suggest immune modulating effects in these species.",

Selection can be based on traditional notions of organ or system affinity, or may be combined according to their other effects on the body. Herbs to consider include Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea, E. angustifolia, E. pallida), Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus), Ligusticum walchii, Pau d'arco (Tabebuia avellanedae), Usnea (Usnea barbata), Picrorrhiza kurroa, Ginseng (Panax spp), and medicinal fungi such as Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum), Maitake mushroom (Grifola frondosa), Shitake mushroom (Lentinus edodes), Turkey tail (Trametes versicolor), and Cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis).\n2.\nTonic and adaptogenic herbs. These include Panax, Eleutherococcus, and Ashwagandha. As a general guide, stimulating herbs should be avoided during the acute phase of an infection. This is perhaps derived from traditional Chinese medicine, wherein stimulating and tonic herbs are contraindicated in Deficient Yin patterns with Heat signs\u2014typically, fever and inflammation or infection. One study on Eleutherococcus showed that administration before induced listeriosis infection in rabbits and mice increased resistance to infection. However, when administration occurred simultaneously with an induced infection, the severity of disease was exacerbated (Farnsworth, 1966). Despite this, Eleutherococcus is frequently found in low doses in formulations for acute infection such as cold and flu.3.\nBitter herbs. Gentiana or any of the bitters described under the gastrointestinal system should be considered; these are generally cooling herbs. If the patient is cool or cold, the cooling effect should be countered with warming herbs. One of the proposed theories for the benefit of bitters is the general improvement that occurs in digestive function, hence enhanced gut-associated lymphoid tissue function. Better immunity at the gut level (T helper 3 cell mediated) helps to moderate and regulate T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells, thereby improving immune balance systemically.\n",

Echinacea improves phagocytosis and generally enhances immune surveillance. It must be used in high doses during acute infections, such as infected wounds or viral infections. In humans, doses of 20 to 30 mL per day can be taken; it takes about 3 days for phagocytic activity to peak. Many studies that detract from the benefits of Echinacea are flawed by incorrect dosing and improper extract type. Echinacea can be used for chronic bacterial and viral infections, postviral syndromes, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from feline leukemia virus (FAIDS), in the appropriate formulas, autoimmune disease and long-term allergies and intolerances. It can be used during chemotherapy or pneumonia, and for chronic purulent or pyodermic skin infection\u2014at relatively high doses in all cases (in humans, 15 mL per day for serious chronic states of immune deficiency). Doses as high as 40 mL on the first day followed by 16 mL daily were used in one positive clinical trial (Goel, 2004). Astragalus, on the other hand, is more appropriately used as a preventive measure during disease outbreaks or for chronic immune incompetence and autoimmune disease (especially nephritis). The dose in humans is between 20 and 40 mL per week. High dosing in the case of Echinacea is an important consideration because it does influence efficacy.",

Cells of the myeloid/granulocyte lineages remained at control levels in the bone marrow and the spleen in Echinacea-consuming mice. Thus, it appears that regular intake of Echinacea may indeed be beneficial or prophylactic because it maintains elevated levels of NK cells, which are elements in immunosurveillance against spontaneously developing tumors (Brousseau, 2005).",

Recent studies with various models show that the anticancer properties of Ginkgo are related to antioxidant, antiangiogenic, and gene-regulatory actions. Antiangiogenic activity may involve antioxidant activity and the ability to inhibit both inducible and endothelial forms of nitric oxide synthase. Exposure of human breast cancer cells to a Ginkgo extract altered expression of the genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, or apoptosis. Exposure of human bladder cancer cells to a Ginkgo extract produces an adaptive transcriptional response that augments antioxidant status and inhibits DNA damage. Flavonoid and terpenoid constituents of Ginkgo extracts may act in a complementary manner to inhibit several carcinogenesis-related processes; therefore, the total extracts may be required for optimal effects (DeFeudis, 2003).",

For example, mice were given decaffeinated green or decaffeinated black tea in their drinking water before, during, and after treatment with a carcinogen. Mice that received 0.63% or 1.25% green tea, or 1.25% black tea, exhibited a reduction in liver tumor numbers of 54%, 50%, and 63%, and a decrease in the mean number of lung tumors of 40%, 46%, and 34%, respectively, compared with controls (Cao 1996). In some experiments, reduction in tumor number and size has been observed in the tea-treated groups; in other experiments, decreased tumor incidence has also been observed (Yang 2005). Black tea preparations have been shown to reduce the incidence and number of spontaneously generated lung adenocarcinomas and rhabdomyosarcomas in mice; they also were noted to inhibit the progression of lung adenoma to adenocarcinoma. In many of these experiments, tea consumption resulted in reduced body fat and body weight; these factors may also contribute to the inhibition of tumorigenesis (Yang, 2005).",

It was concluded that flaxseed inhibits human breast cancer growth and metastasis in a mouse model, and that this effect is due in part to the downregulation of insulin-like growth factor I and epidermal growth factor receptor expression (Chen, 2002).",

Injection of acemannan has been shown to offer increased immune protection against implanted malignant tumor cells (Merriam, 1995). Acemannan in the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) induces apoptosis in cancer cells (Ramamoorthy, 1998). It is conditionally licensed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the treatment of dogs and cats with fibrosarcoma (King, 1995). A total of eight dogs and five cats with histopathologically confirmed fibrosarcoma were treated with acemannan in combination with surgery and radiation therapy. Following four to seven weekly treatments, tumor shrinkage occurred in 4 of 12 animals. Complete surgical excision was performed on all animals between 4 and 7 weeks after initiation of acemannan therapy. Radiation therapy was instituted immediately after surgery. Acemannan treatments were continued monthly for 1 year. In all, 7 of 13 animals were alive and tumor free (range, 440+ to 603+ days), with a median survival time of 372 days. Acemannan may be an effective adjunct to surgery and radiation therapy in the treatment of canine and feline fibrosarcomas (King, 1995). A total of 43 dogs and cats with spontaneous tumor were treated with acemannan by intraperitoneal and intralesional routes of administration. Tumors from 26 of these animals showed marked necrosis or lymphocytic infiltration. Moderate to marked tumor necrosis or liquefaction was noted in 13 animals. In all, 21 demonstrated lymphoid infiltration, and 7 demonstrated encapsulation. A total of 12 animals showed obvious clinical improvement, as assessed by tumor shrinkage, tumor necrosis, or prolonged survival; these included five of the seven animals with fibrosarcoma. It is believed that acemannan exerts its antitumor activity through macrophage activation and the release of tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and interferon (Harris, 1991).",

Survival was significantly prolonged and enlargement of thymic lymphoma was significantly suppressed compared with controls. Proliferation of leukemia (MuLV) viruses in the thymus was markedly inhibited as compared with untreated controls after the first oral administration of the E. purpurea preparation. Endogenous IFN-\u03b3 was also effectively augmented with Echinacea; however, the production of other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-12 was minimal. Thus, suppressive effects on MuLV may depend on enhancement of nonspecific immune or cellular immune systems (or both) by Echinacea (Hayashi, 2001). Daily dietary administration of E. purpurea root extract to normal mice for as little as 1 week also resulted in significant elevations in NK cells (immune cells that are cytolytic to virus-containing cells and many tumor cells). Such boosting of this fundamental immune cell population suggests a prophylactic role for this herb in normal animals (Currier, 2001). E. purpurea\u2013treated mice exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in the absolute numbers of NK cells in their spleens. By 3 months after leukemia induction, E. purpurea\u2013treated mice still had 2 to 3 times the normal numbers of NK cells in their spleens compared with controls. No leukemic, untreated (control) mice remained alive at 3 months; however, at 3 months after tumor onset, all major hematopoietic and immune cell lineages in the bone marrow birth site were recorded at normal numbers in E. purpurea\u2013consuming, leukemic mice. The survival advantage provided by administration of E. purpurea to these leukemic mice versus untreated mice was highly significant (Currier, 2001).",

Whether Hoxsey's particular formula has therapeutic merit is still unsubstantiated by clinical data, despite provocative findings of antitumor properties in many of the individual herbs that he used. However, anecdotal evidence from veterinarians who have used various versions of the formula indicates that it improves quality of life and may inhibit growth of tumors in animals. It is difficult to evaluate the benefits of the traditional approach of detoxification through laxative effects, liver support, improved nutrition, and so forth, all of which may strengthen the immune system and favorably affect the cancer status of a human patient (Spain, 1988); Hoxsey proposed that this was how the formula worked.",

In a review of all English articles listed in Index Medicus between the years 1990 and 2000 that were related to antioxidants and interactions with anticancer drugs or radiation, the authors concluded, \u201cThere is a rational basis for the continued use of antioxidant agents as a therapeutic adjunct in cancer therapy, with such use also offering potential to abrogate the carcinogenic process and mutation-driven drug resistance, but convincing data and widespread acceptance of such a role [are] dependent on additional, appropriately relevant trials\u201d (Block, 2001). Chemotherapeutic drugs that are best known for creating cellular damage by initiating free radical and reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage include the alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and melphalan; the tumor antibiotics, such as doxorubicin, bleomycin, and epirubicin; and the platinum compounds, such as cisplatin (Conklin, 2000; Labriola, 1999; Lamson, 1999; Lamson, 2000). Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to produce cell kill through free radical generation (Lamson, 1999; Lamson, 2000). Unfortunately, a number of physiologic adverse effects of these therapies (e.g., doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, cisplatin-induced nephrotoxity, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis) are related to oxidative damage (Conklin, 2000). Evidence is accumulating that antioxidants are helpful in attenuating these side effects (Ferreira, 2004), (Weijl, 2004). Careful selection of herbs that help reduce these adverse effects and protect these organs and systems (see relevant system herbs) can be used. Because antioxidant activity is inherent in many herbs, two options with chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, if the theoretical concern exists. Herbal treatment should be stopped just before conventional treatment is begun (24-48 hours) and recommenced in approximately 5-7 days depending on the half life of the chemotherapeutic drug (or longer for radiation therapy); or herbal treatment should be continued concurrently. In the authors' experience, concurrent treatment helps to reduce the adverse effects of treatment and to maintain \u201cwellness.\u201d",

Drug therapies for myocardial failure are \u201cBand-Aid therapies\u201d that palliate the effects of heart disease for a short duration but do little to address the primary disease process. Some goals of drug therapy are to reduce pulmonary venous pressure and augment systolic performance. In addition, therapy is increasingly targeting neurohormonal changes that hasten the progression of heart failure, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system. It is worth noting that some herbs traditionally used for heart failure (such as hawthorn and linden) have mild anxiolytic activity, which may reduce sympathetic nervous system activity.",

Administered to patients suffering from endocarditis and pericarditis, it quickly subdues the inflammation. It is a good remedy for cardiac palpitation \u2026 It is best adapted to those forms of heart disease characterized by irritability and irregularity, with dyspnea and precordial oppression. Lycopus powerfully increases the contraction of the unstriped muscular fibers, particularly those of the heart and arteries, hence its value in cardiac dilatation and hypertrophy, which have been known to undergo marked improvement under its administration. It quickly relieves the suffering and anxiety nearly always experienced in heart disease. It has favorably influenced exophthalmic goiter.\u201d Despite its previous popularity as a treatment for arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy, this herb has not been investigated in clinical trials.",

King's says that goldenseal \u201cappears to stimulate the respiratory and circulatory apparatus, imparting increased tone and power. Arterial tension is augmented, and blood pressure in the capillaries increased, rendering it valuable, like belladonna and ergot, in overcoming blood stasis. Its action upon the nervous system has been compared [with] that of strychnine (Ellingwood, 1919), [although] less energetic, but more permanent. Thus, the tone imparted to the heart muscle is permanent, rather than intermittent or spasmodic.\u201d Animal studies show that berberine decreases heart rate and may act like a Class III antiarrhythmic (Riccioppo, 1993; Huang, 1992). Zeng and associates investigated the effects of 1.2 to 2.0 g berberine given daily to people with congestive heart failure who were experiencing ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) or ventricular tachycardia. Compared with people taking placebo, a significantly greater increase was noted in left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise capacity, and the dyspnea\u2013fatigue index, as was a decrease in the frequency and complexity of VPCs. Over the following 24 months, a significant decrease in mortality was observed in these patients as well (Zeng, 2003). Goldenseal root may consist of 0.5% to 6% berberine, and Coptis rhizome may contain 4% to 9% berberine. The barberry plant may contain 1% to 3% berberine.",

In toxemia, normal elimination through the liver, gut, and kidneys is impaired, allowing the accumulation of toxic metabolites. In the case of chronic dermatitis, the eliminative process most frequently impaired is considered the digestive system. The aim of therapy was always to remove toxins by enhancing and supporting the eliminatory functions of the body. The most useful herbs that have been employed traditionally are the alteratives, also known as depuratives or \u201cblood cleansers.\u201d These herbs effect changes in metabolic processes within the body and usually have mild laxative or diuretic actions, among others, so it can be seen that the approach of improving \u201celimination\u201d has some merit if toxemia is present. Other herbs facilitate the various detoxification mechanisms used by the body and can help restore normal metabolism and immune function.",

In human medicine, inert, nonmetabolized sugars such as mannitol, rhamnose, or lactulose are used to measure the permeability barrier or the degree of leakiness of the intestinal mucosa. Permeability is increased in a number of gastrointestinal tract diseases (such as parasitic infestation, infection, inflammation) and can be increased through trauma, burns, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The major determinant of the rate of intestinal permeability is the opening or closure of the tight junctions between enterocytes in the paracellular space (Hollander, 1999).",

Triterpenoids are regarded as active principles and are reported to possess wound-healing abilities associated with their stimulating effects on the epidermis and promotion of keratinization. Both asiaticoside and madecassoside are documented to be anti-inflammatory agents (Jacker, 1982). Oral and topical administration of an alcoholic extract of C. asiatica for rat dermal wound healing was investigated. The extract increased cellular proliferation and collagen synthesis at the wound site, as evidenced by increased DNA, protein, and collagen content of granulation tissues; wounds treated with the extract were found to epithelialize faster and the rate of wound contraction was higher, as compared with control wounds. Results showed that C. asiatica produced different actions in the various phases of wound repair (Suguna, 1996).",

Inhibitory effects of the dietary intake of German chamomile extract were comparable with those of the antiallergic agent oxatomide (Kobayashi, 2003).

The antipruritic effects of the H1 antagonists oxatomide and fexofena-dine were only partial in this test. However, the antipruritic effects of these agents were enhanced through combined administration of the ethyl acetate extract of German chamomile (300 mg/kg).

The British Herbal Pharmacopoeia (1983) and the British Herbal Compendium offer no contraindications for Echinacea. In fact, it is proposed (Bone, 1997) that molecular mimicry by infectious organisms may be causative in autoimmune disease, and that Echinacea may be benefical in decreasing the chronic presence of microorganisms. Echinacea increases phagocytic activity and increases immune surveillance. This may assist the body in eliminating organisms or neutralizing their imbalancing effects on the immune system, thereby downregulating an inappropriate immune response.\n",

It has been suggested that glycyrrhizin and GA may exert their mineralocorticoid effects via inhibition of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-OHSD) (Stewart, 1987). 11\u03b2-OHSD is a microsomal enzyme complex found predominantly in the liver and kidneys that catalyzes the conversion of cortisol (potent mineralocorticoid activity) to inactive cortisone. Deficiency of 11\u03b2-OHSD results in increased concentrations of urinary free cortisol and cortisol metabolites. GA has been shown to inhibit renal 11\u03b2-OHSD in rats (Stewart, 1987). It has also been proposed that glycyrrhizin and GA may prevent cortisol from binding to transcortin (Forslund, 1989). One recent case study reports the use of licorice in an Addisonian dog with persistent hyperkalemia. Preliminary results show the dog to be normokalemic after licorice administration (Jarrett, 2005).",

These compounds represent precursors of biologically active products that are formed through an oxidation step.

In vitro studies using isolated rat pancreatic islets have shown that ginsenosides promote an insulin release that is independent of extracellular calcium and that uses a different mechanism from that of glucose (Guodong, 1987). In addition, in vivo studies in rats have reported that a ginseng extract increases the number of insulin receptors in bone marrow and reduces the number of glucocorticoid receptors in rat brain homogenate (Yushu, 1988). Both of these actions are thought to contribute to the antidiabetic actions of ginseng.",

Pronounced reductions in T4 and TSH concentrations were observed 24 h after application of the extract by gavage (Winterhoff, 1994). Lycopus virginicus and Lycopus europaeus have the ability to inhibit many of the effects of exogenous and endogenous TSH on the thyroid gland; they inhibit adenylate cyclase in the thyroid and inhibit cAMP, particularly at high doses (Auf'mkolk. 1984b). Aqueous extracts from L. virginicus also inhibit extrathyroidal enzymic T4-5\u2032-deiodination to T3 and T4-5\u2032-deiodination. These effects are dose dependent.

Condensed tannins (flavanols) include catechins, epicatechins, and epigallocatechin gallate, which is found in teas and red wine; they are considered to be very safe.

In a review of evidence from randomized controlled studies, one study was found for each of the following conditions: seasickness, morning sickness, and chemotherapy-induced nausea; these studies collectively favored ginger over placebo (Ernst, 2000a). A later review of antiemetic therapies by the Cochrane Collaboration found 7 trials of ginger for vomiting in early pregnancy (Jewell, 2006). Studies have documented the antiemetic effects of ginger extract in vivo in dogs (Chang, 1986; Sharma, 1997) and frogs (Kawai, 1994). In dogs, acetone and ethanolic extracts of ginger, administered intragastrically at doses of 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, protected against cisplatin-induced emesis (3 mg/kg administered intravenously 30 minutes before ginger extract), compared with control. However, ginger extracts were less effective in preventing emesis than was the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron, and they were ineffective against apomorphine-induced emesis (Sharma, 1997). The emetic action of the peripherally acting agent copper sulfate was inhibited in dogs given an intragastric dose of ginger extract, but emesis in pigeons treated with centrally acting emetics such as apomorphine and digitalis could not be inhibited by a ginger extract (Zhou, 1960). These results suggest that ginger's antiemetic activity is peripheral and does not involve the central nervous system. The antiemetic action of ginger has been attributed to the combined action of zingerones and shogaols (Ghazanfar, 1994).",

A standardized extract perfused into the stomachs of anesthetized rats increased gastric secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Lower doses caused no changes in gastric pH, whereas higher doses increased pH from 4.25 to 4.85. A dose of 0.5 mL/kg did not affect the incidence of gastric ulceration in rats (EMEA, 2002). In an open, uncontrolled study, a single dose of an alcoholic extract of gentian (equivalent to 0.2 g) given to 10 healthy volunteers was reported to result in stimulation of gastric juice secretion (Glatzel, 1967). Gallbladder emptying was increased and prolonged while protein and fat digestion was enhanced. A total of 19 patients with inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., colitis, Crohn's disease, nonspecific inflammation) and elevated secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentrations and 8 healthy individuals were treated with gentian tincture (3 \u00d7 20 drops/d) for 8 days.

The active principle silymarin protects when given 60 minutes before intoxication with phalloidine, or 10 minutes after intoxication. However, as the time span between administration of the toxic substance and the start of treatment increases, so the efficacy of silymarin decreases; after 30 minutes, its curative effect is negligible (Desplaces, 1975). Silymarin was tested in dogs that were subjected to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) intoxication, which leads to damage of the liver. The protective effects of silymarin were manifested by the significantly lower aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities and by the insignificantly reduced extent of lesions in the liver parenchyma, compared with the control CCl4-intoxicated group (Paulova, 1990). In another study, beagles were divided into 5 groups, and given 85 mg/kg Amanita phalloides lyophilizate orally. The 5 groups, after receiving Amanita extract, were then administered either no treatment (as a control group), prednisolone 30 mg/kg iv at 5 and 24 hours, cytochrome C 50 mg/kg iv at 5 and 24 hours, penicillin G 1000 mg/kg iv at 5 hours, or silymarin 50 mg/kg iv at 5 hours and 30 mg/kg iv at 24 hours. Blood was sampled at 5, 24, 48, 96 and 192 hours and changes in liver enzymes were monitored. At 24 hours post Amanita administration, GPT and GOT levels of the control group averaged over 4000 U/l while those of the silymarin group remained under 60 U/l, slightly lower than the penicillin group and significantly lower than those dogs administered prednisone or cytochrome C. At 48 hours, the control groups' values had returned to near normal with the exception of GPT, which averaged 2250 U/l. The prednisone group transaminase values continued to climb rather than resolve, and the other groups, including the silymarin group, remained in normal ranges (Floersheim, 1978). Studies were conducted on the effects of silybin on the biological activities of Kupffer cells in regenerating livers of rats subjected to partial hepatectomy; results showed that silybin increased the mitotic activity of Kupffer cells (Magliulo, 1979).",

In other animals, the action is far more rapid (Daykin, 1960). The glycosides are metabolized by glycosidases in the intestinal flora to form active anthrones. The laxative action is due to increased motility of the large intestine attained by inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump and chloride ion channels; enhanced fluid secretion occurs because of stimulation of secretion of mucus and chloride ion (ESCP, 1997).",

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the main constituent of green tea polyphenols, has been reported to have inhibitory effects on the activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are involved in alveolar bone resorption in periodontal disease (Yun, 2004). Likewise, baicalin inhibits metalloproteinases, which suggests that baicalin and plants that contain high levels of it may play an important role in preventing and treating periodontal disease (Li, 2004).",

There may be reason to connect toxin accumulation with pain and inflammation, and the more modern concept of \u201cleaky gut\u201d can explain why herbalists generally direct some efforts toward normalizing gut function, as well as directly addressing joint and muscle pain and inflammation. Leaky gut occurs in animals that may be older and stressed because of chronic pain or disease, especially when steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (which may often lead to mucosal inflammation) change normal gut permeability. When the gut mucosa is altered in this way, large proteins such as food as well as bacterial, and self antigens may gain access to the submucosa and possibly even the portal circulation. The normal gut is responsible for making primary immune responses, but it also makes significant neuroendocrine responses, including the production of serotonin, benzodiazepines, glutamate, enkephalins, nitric oxide, and dopamine. The end clinical response is increased immune responsiveness, systemic inflammation and perhaps altered behavior (Figure 20-2\n).",

Arnica was also investigated in a double-blind trial with 37 humans undergoing bilateral endoscopic carpal tunnel release surgery.

It acts specifically by depleting stores of substance P from sensory neurons; it has been used successfully in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, peripheral neuropathies, and fibromyalgia, and is applied topically. Capsicum oleoresin, however, contains more than 100 volatile compounds and may have a variety of other actions. Other capsaicinoids have anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting activation of NF-kappa-B and certain events in T-cell activation (Sancho, 2002).",

It may be used alone or with specific valerian, equal parts. Its action is slow, but its effects are permanent. It has been used successfully as an antispasmodic in hysteria, epilepsy when due to menstrual failures, asthma and kindred affections, periodical convulsions, nervous excitability, pertussis, delirium tremens, and many other spasmodic affections.\u201d",

The German Commission E approved its use for mood disturbances such as restlessness and anxiety, as well as for sleep disturbances (Blumenthal, 1998). King's describes hops this way: \u201cThey are principally used for their sedative or hypnotic action\u2014producing sleep, removing restlessness, and abating pain, but which they often fail to accomplish.\u201d Whole extracts of hops were generally administered for this purpose in the form of ale or porter. The Eclectics preferred a powdered extract called lupulin, and found it much more reliable. Early laboratory animal and human clinical studies showed no sedative effects (Hansel, 1967; Stocker, 1967). Later studies showed that one auto-oxidation product had strong sedative properties in animals (Wohlfart, 1983; H\u00e4nsel, 1980; Wohlfart, 1982). This is an aromatic principle, and the authors warned that it may be present in traditional hops pillows, but not in many herb extracts. However, it has also been suggested that isovaleric acid residues present in hops may contribute to its sedative action in mice. Hops extract administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before a series of behavioral tests resulted in dose-dependent suppression of spontaneous locomotion at a dose of 250 mg/kg for up to 1 hour (Lee, 1993).",

Glycowithanolides of withania (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally, for 21 days) induced a dose-related increase in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity in rat brain; this effect was comparable to the benefit of deprenyl (Bhattacharya, 1997). Sitoindosides VII through X and withaferin-A were studied on brain cholinergic, glutamatergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic receptors in rats. Results suggested that the compounds preferentially affect events in the cortical and basal forebrain cholinergic signal transduction cascade. The drug-induced increase in cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptor capacity might explain in part the cognition-enhancing and memory-improving effects of extracts from Withania somnifera observed in animals and humans (Schliebs, 1997). GABA binding was inhibited by 20% with 5 \u03bcg Withania root extract and completely by 1 mg. This extract increased Cl influx, which was blocked by bicuculline and picrotoxin and was enhanced by diazepam. These results suggest that the W. somnifera extract contains an ingredient that has a GABA-mimetic activity (Mehta, 1991). Withania has been used to stabilize mood in patients with behavioral disturbances.",

It was also used as an antispasmodic, and Cook's Physiomedical Dispensatory (1869) calls it a \u201cdiffuse nervine and antispasmodic of much service.\u201d Laboratory animal studies have produced somewhat conflicting results regarding sleep time and activity. Two studies suggest that components of catnip have some sedative activity. Catnip oil (500 mg/kg) and nepetalic acid (62.5 mg/kg) were found to significantly increase sleep time in mice. Rats showed a significant decrease in performance in avoidance studies after intraperitoneal injections of catnip oil (500-750 mg/kg), nepetalic acid (125-250 mg/kg), and the nepetalactone-enriched fraction (500-750 mg/kg) (Harney, 1978). The alcohol extract of catnip showed a biphasic effect on the behavior of young chicks, increasing the number of chicks who slept at low and moderate doses (25-1800 mg/kg), while high dose levels (i.e., above 2 g/kg) led fewer chicks to sleep (Sherry, 1979). On the other hand, Massoco and colleagues (1995) fed mice catnip at 10% of their dietary intake and discovered amphetamine-like activity. A case report described a single child who ate a large amount of catnip and was obtunded (Osterhoudt, 1997). Aydin (1998) determined that nepetalactone (a component of Nepeta cataria and other species of Nepeta) had specific activity at some opioid receptor subtypes. Unique behavioral reactions of cats have been observed in the presence of catnip. The chemosensory stimulus evoking the catnip reaction is undoubtedly mediated through the main olfactory system. These behaviors, include sniffing and chewing as associated with oral appetitive behavior, rolling and rubbing characteristic of female sexual behavior, batting the catnip source characteristic of play behavior, and a type of kicking associated with predatory behavior. These behavioral reactions occur randomly and intermittently (Hart, 1985).",

Laboratory animal studies suggest that this plant has some sedative activity (Della Loggia, 1981). The herb is toxic in high doses (producing seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest) and probably is not appropriate for long-term use. The human dose of the fluid extract recommended by King's (Felter, 1898) is 10 drops to 2 fluid drachm (approximately 7 mL) daily, but doses recommended by the British Herbal Compendium are higher: 2 to 4 g of dried root bark, 5 to 15 mL of the tincture (1 : 5 in 45%), or 2 to 8 mL of the liquid extract (1 : 1 in 60%) three times daily (Bradley 1992).",

Twelve subjects were evaluated with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder of at least 12 months' duration. Treatment lasted for 12 weeks, with a dose of 450 mg of 0.3% hypericin twice daily. Weekly and monthly evaluations were conducted. A significant change from baseline to endpoint was found, which occurred at 1 week and continued to increase throughout the trial. At endpoint, 5 of 12 were rated much or very much improved, 6 were minimally improved, and 1 had no change (Taylor, 2000).

Patients were allocated in a random fashion for a 4-week trial: 18 to the Passionflower 45 drops/day plus placebo tablet group, and 18 to the oxazepam 30 mg/day plus placebo drops group. Both were effective in the treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder with no significant difference between the two protocols. Oxazepam showed a rapid onset of action but significantly more problems related to impairment of job performance. The results suggested that Passionflower is an effective drug for the management of generalized anxiety disorder with a low incidence of impaired job performance (Akhondzadeh, 2001b). Dhawan and colleagues (2003, 2004) have investigated a benzoflavone of Passionflower with particularly potent CNS depressant activity.",

The mechanisms thought to be operative include blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, enhanced GABA A receptor binding, diminished excitatory neurotransmitter release due to calcium channel blockade, reduced neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine, monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibition, and thromboxane A2 synthesis suppression, the latter of which antagonizes GABA A receptor function (Singh, 2002). The Eclectics did not seem to recognize this herb as anxiolytic but did note pain-relieving properties and diuresis. Felter listed the specific indications as \u201cirritation, inflammation, or debility of the urinary passages; chronic catarrhal inflammations; vesical irritation and inflammation; vesical atony; painful micturition, strangury, and dysuria.\u201d With consideration of its accepted anxiolytic properties and traditional indications for diuresis, urinary tract pain, and inflammation, kava seems particularly appropriate for cases of feline interstitial cystitis, in addition to short-term use for other conditions in which anxiety is present.",

Zingicomb, a preparation consisting of ginger and Ginkgo biloba extracts, administered intragastrically has anxiolytic-like properties. A study assessed the effects of acute treatment with this preparation on inhibitory avoidance learning. The influence of zingicomb on avoidance conditioning was investigated in rats treated intragastrically with vehicle or 0.5, 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg zingicomb 60 minutes before the trial. When tested 24 hours after training, rats that had received 10 mg/kg zingicomb exhibited significantly longer step-through latencies than did vehicle-treated animals. In contrast to conventional anxiolytic drugs, which tend to have amnesic properties, zingicomb is a potent anxiolytic agent that may facilitate performance on a learning task (Topic, 2002).",

In a similar study, clove oil (85%\u201395% eugenol) was only slightly less effective than quinaldine and more effective than benzocaine, MS-222, and 2-phenoxyethanol. Clove oil had a much calmer induction to anesthesia than did quinaldine, along with a recovery time that was 2 to 3 times longer (Munday, 1997). The anesthetic effects of clove oil\u2013derived eugenol were studied in juvenile rainbow trout. Times to induction and recovery from anesthesia were measured and compared with those of MS-222. Eugenol induced anesthesia faster and at lower concentrations than did MS-222, and recovery times for eugenol were 6 to 10 times longer. Clove oil eugenol was determined to be an acceptable anesthetic for use in aquaculture and aquatic research. It was found that 40 to 60 ppm eugenol induced rapid anesthesia, with a relatively short time for recovery in juvenile trout (Keene, 1998). Juvenile rabbitfish were anesthetized and their length and weight recorded on three separate occasions. Fish were fed shortly afterward, and no mortality was observed. Clove oil appeared to be highly effective as a fish anesthetic with potentially few or no adverse effects (Soto, 1995).",

Another showed that various extracts increased swimming time and attenuated the rise in blood corticosterone (Kimura, 2004). Mouse studies also suggest that Eleuthero can enhance cellular and humoral immunity (Rogala, 2003). Elderly human patients given Eleuthero experienced temporary improvements in social functioning that were measured at 4 weeks but did not last to 8 weeks of the trial (Cicero, 2004). Hartz and associates examined 96 people with chronic fatigue who had been given Eleuthero or placebo and found no statistically significant differences between groups (Hartz, 2004). Some animal studies and one human study in athletes (Gaffney, 2001) showed that Eleuthero actually increased hormonal indices of stress. In a controlled study of 1000 Siberian factory workers, a 50% reduction in illness and a 40% reduction in lost workdays were noted over 1 year (Bone, 2003).",

Substances that reduce extracellular glutamate concentrations are of interest for their potential as anticonvulsant agents.

Results suggest that THP may have antiepileptogenic and anticonvulsant activity (Lin, 2002). Administration of picrotoxin increases locomotion, elevation of turning, and inhibition of postural freezing in rats; it also increases amygdaloidal release of dopamine in anesthetized rats. All these activity measures induced by picrotoxin were suppressed following THP treatment.

Saint John's wort standardized to 0.3% hypericin content was administered for 9 weeks in doses of 4.3 and 13 \u03bcg/kg, corresponding to therapeutic dosages in humans of 0.3 and 0.9 mg of total hypericins daily.

An experiment was carried out to define the stimulating effects of Tribestan on rams that were intended for breeding, as well as on rams that exhibited sexual impotence and deteriorated semen qualities. Treatment led to an extended period of sexual activity and improvement of semen production in rams over the service period. Results of Tribestan therapy with rams with reduced libido showed that the animals could recover with no morphologic changes in the structure of the testes and epididymides. The use of this preparation raised the testosterone level and normalized the sexual activity of rams affected by impotence (Dimitrov, 1987). Tribestan increased testosterone levels and accelerated sexual development in rams and male lambs, respectively (Georgiev, 1988). Libido and sexual reflexes were restored in boars with long-term sexual impotence (Zarkova, 1984).",

It has been suggested that the effects of EGb 761 in the experimental animal models described previously may involve aspects of neuronal plasticity (e.g., neuronal regeneration) (DeFeudis, 1998). Ischemia-induced lipid peroxidation is one of the most important causes of tissue damage in spinal cord injury. In one study, the protective effects of Ginkgo biloba, thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH), and methylprednisolone on compression injury of the rat spinal cord were investigated. Ginkgo biloba treatments significantly decreased malondialdehyde levels, which suggests that methylprednisolone and Ginkgo biloba may provide protection against ischemic spinal cord injury through the antioxidant effect (Koc, 1995). In another study, when pretreatment with a ginkgo extract was given 7 days before induced ischemia, followed by reperfusion, treated rabbits had only a slight tremor in the hind limbs compared with completely paraplegic controls. This study indicated that the ginkgo extract can scavenge free radicals produced during ischemia/reperfusion and may reduce reperfusion damage (Mechirova, 2002).",

Treatment with American ginseng, ginkgo extract, or Saint John's wort alone failed to offer neuroprotection to injured retinal ganglion cells. However, treatment with a mixture of American ginseng, ginkgo extract, or Saint John's wort significantly augmented retinal ganglion cells survival 7 days postaxotomy. Treatment with the combination also induced a significant increase in the number of regenerating RGCs 21 days after optic nerve transection.

Rams with reduced libido recovered by the seventh or eighth day with no morphologic changes in the structure of both testes and epididymides.

Another study (Jensen, 1968) found the total milk yield to be around 6% higher in dairy cows fed 3% Ascophyllum nodosum in a fortified seaweed meal, over a 7-year period in Norway, than in controls. The test concluded that the fortified seaweed meal was superior to the standard mineral mixtures for milk production. In the seaweed group, the incidence of mastitis was markedly reduced (90% in the control group); the number of services needed per conception was decreased and the number of no returns was increased; and a marked increase was seen in the iodine content of milk.

A dose of 15 g of a concentrated extract was administered three times daily (Li, 1997). A protective effect is exerted by ginkgolides on platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced bronchoconstriction and airway hyperactivity. Oral or intravenous injection of ginkgolide B antagonizes cardiovascular impairments and bronchoconstriction induced by PAF. Ginkgolide B does not appear to interfere with cyclooxygenase, but it does have an effect in an earlier step involving PAF receptors and phospholipase activation. Eosinophil infiltration occurs in asthma and in allergic reactions, the number of eosinophils increasing during late phase. Because PAF is a potent activator of eosinophil function, it has been argued that ginkgolide B may interfere with the late-phase response (Hosford, 1988). A randomized, double-blind, crossover study involved patients with atopic asthma who were challenged with a specific dust or pollen antigen. After 6.5 hours, participants were subjected to a provocation test with acetylcholine. Mixed ginkgolide standardized extract, 40 mg three times daily, or placebo was given during the 3 days before the test, and a final single dose of 120 mg of extract was given 2 hours before the challenge. Results suggested that ginkgolides were effective in both the early phase and the late phase of airway hyperactivity (Braquet, 1987).",

It is no surprise that traditional herbal medicine \u201cdiuretics\u201d played an important role in the treatment of urinary tract disorders. However, the term diuretic in herbal medicine is not the same as that in conventional medicine; it can be used in a number of other ways. Traditionally, herbs were given as a decoction or infusion for urinary conditions, and the additional water consumption would have produced an observable diuresis. Hence, many herbs were classified as diuretics, whether they had genuine diuretic action or not. The \u201cflushing\u201d of the bladder naturally assisted in the treatment of cystitis. This strategy can also be employed in treating animals. Simply encouraging animals to drink more water or broth may accomplish the same end. Nonetheless, in many traditional herbal writings, diuretics were herbs that were considered to enhance excretion of waste through the kidneys (perhaps better classed as \u201cdiuretic depuratives\u201d); they included herbs like Dandelion leaf (Taraxacum officinale), Cleavers (Gallium aparine), Burdock (Arctium lappa), Red clover (Trifolium pretense), Heartsease (Viola tricolor), and Celery (Apium graveolens).

The mechanism of action of parsley seems to be mediated through an inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump that would lead to a reduction in Na+ and K+ reabsorption, leading thus to an osmotic water flow into the lumen, and diuresis (Kreydiyyeh, 2002).",

The bladders of treated animals showed less edema, ulceration, and cellular infiltration when compared with those of controls (Deshpande, 1982). A crude extract at 100 mg/kg given orally to rats significantly reduced stone formation (81%) (Prabhakar, 1997). The effects of oral administration of Crataeva nurvala bark decoction on calcium oxalate lithiasis have been studied in rats. Crataeva reduced the oxalate-synthesizing liver enzyme, glycolate oxidase, which is produced by the feeding of glycolic acid; this caused a regulatory action on endogenous oxalate synthesis. Increased deposition of stone-forming constituents in the kidneys of calculogenic rats was lowered with decoction administration. Increased urinary excretion of the crystalline constituents, along with lowered magnesium excretion, in stone-forming rats was partially reversed by decoction treatment (Varalakshmi, 1990). Among 46 human patients with calcium oxalate stones that used 50 mL decoction twice daily for between 1 and 47 weeks, 28 passed the stone and 18 experienced symptomatic relief. This is thought to be due to the tonic contractile action of the drug on smooth muscle (Deshpande, 1982). Stem bark decoction was used in patients with calcium oxalate stones. After 12 weeks, a significant reduction in pain and dysuria was observed, along with some reduction in the size of stones (Singh, 1991).",

Astragalus can increase albumin level in plasma, decrease the output of urinary protein, and increase muscle protein. These actions may help prevent glomerular sclerosis (Zhou, 1999). Oral doses improve renal function in rats with experimental nephritis, and large doses are traditionally used in the treatment of chronic nephritis (Chang, 1987). A total of 30 human patients with chronic glomerulonephritis were enrolled in an open study. After injection of 40 mg/day for 3 weeks, proteinuria dropped dramatically\u2014by more than half (Shi, 2002). Two other studies in 106 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and in animal models that included immune complex nephritis have also demonstrated the ability of Astragalus to significantly reduce proteinuria (Peng, 2005). Thus, the effects of Astragalus on reduction of proteinuria may have benefit in slowing the progression of renal disease. In another study, serum creatinine was significantly reduced and creatinine clearance increased in patients treated with 32 g of Astragalus per day, compared with controls, in whom no significant change was observed (Zhao, 2000).",

Initially, it was thought that the antibacterial effect of cranberry juice was a result of its ability to acidify urine and, therefore, to inhibit bacterial growth. However, recent work has focused on the effects of cranberry in inhibiting bacterial adherence and on the effects of antiadhesion agents in cranberry juice. Bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces is considered to be an important step in the development of urinary tract infection (Reid, 1987). It is facilitated by fimbriae on the bacterial cell wall, which produce adhesins that attach to specific receptors on uroepithelial cells (Beachey, 1981). Proanthocyanidins extracted from cranberries have been shown to inhibit the adherence of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cell surfaces, suggesting that proanthocyanidins may be important for the stated effects of cranberry in urinary tract infection (Howell, 1998). Cranberry juice cocktail provided antiadherence activity directed toward gram-negative rods, including Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Proteus species (Schmidt, 1988). In a review of two randomized controlled trials, it was found that cranberry (as juice or capsule) significantly reduced the incidence of urinary tract infection in women. Evidence supports the use of cranberry to prevent urinary tract infection in some populations, but none to support its use as a treatment (Griffiths, 2003).",

Traditionally, it has been used for cystitis, urethritis, dysuria, pyelitis, lithuria, and, specifically, acute catarrhal cystitis with dysuria and highly acidic urine (British Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 1983; Wren, 1988). The antiseptic and diuretic properties claimed for uva ursi can be attributed to its hydroquinone derivatives, especially the constituent arbutin. Arbutin is absorbed intact from the gastrointestinal tract and during renal excretion is hydrolyzed to yield the active principle, hydroquinone, which exerts antiseptic and astringent actions on the urinary mucous membranes (Matsuda, 1992b). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, 57 women with more than three episodes of cystitis in the previous year received herbal extract or placebo. The herbal medicine consisted of bearberry and dandelion root and leaf. Treatment for 1 month significantly reduced the recurrence of cystitis during the 1-year follow-up, with no cystitis in the treated group and 23% recurrence in the placebo group. No adverse effects were reported (Larsson, 1993). It should be noted that alkaline urine is necessary for arbutin to work. Urinary acidifiers inhibit the conversion of arbutin to an active hydroquinone, making uva ursi less effective (De Smet, 1993).",
