Downstream from the replicase gene, there are smaller ORFs which encode the structural proteins S, E, M, the nucleocapsid (N) protein and a number of presumptive non-structural proteins of largely unknown function (Luytjes, 1995).",

            "text": "The role of CCoV in inducing enteric illness in canids has been the subject of active investigation for over two decades. The virus is responsible for mild to moderate enteritis in dogs; in young pups, or in combination with other pathogens, illness may be severe with diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration, loss of appetite and even death (Evermann et al., 1980, Appel, 1988). Shedding of CCoV in faeces occurs over a range of 6\u201314 days post-infection (Keenan et al., 1976, Tennant et al., 1991), however, faecal shedding in infected pups has been detected by n-PCR for periods from 37 to 150 days (Pratelli et al., 2001, Pratelli et al., 2002a). The value of CCoV vaccines in providing adequate immunity under field conditions is controversial. Although the efficacy and the duration of immunity engendered by inactivated vaccines have not been substantiated, killed CCoV vaccines have been licensed in the USA. In a recent study, the low efficacy of an inactivated CCoV vaccine in reducing the viral shedding in faeces of dogs after CCoV infection is described (Pratelli et al., 2003). A modified-live (ML) CCoV vaccine was licensed in USA in 1983, but was rapidly withdrawn due to a high rate (about 5%) of serious adverse reactions (Martin, 1985, Wilson et al., 1986). A ML CCoV vaccine, available in California and recently licensed in USA, appears to be safe and 1-year duration of immunity is claimed by the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the CCoV vaccine, when combined with canine cell-grown distemper vaccine (Rockborn strain), resulted in a high frequency of post-distemper encephalitis (Carmichael, 1997).",
