            "text": "Scientists, policy makers, and industry experts support the gradual electrification of road transportation as a strategy to reduce transport-related oil dependency, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and urban air pollution (e.g., IEA, 2009, EGCI, 2010, EU, 2012, Weeda et al., 2012). In pursuit of these objectives, mass-produced battery-electric cars were introduced to the market around the year 2010. The number of manufacturers and the diversity of models offered has been growing since. However, battery-electric cars are still relatively expensive and suffer from short drive ranges and the absence of a wide-spread recharging infrastructure. It appears questionable whether battery-electric cars can penetrate the market at a large scale without policy support or substantially increasing oil prices (Weiss et al., 2012). More, immediate potentials for the electrification of road transport, notably in urban areas, may be offered by electric two-wheelers such as e-bikes, e-scooters, and e-motorcycles.",

Fully-charged drive ranges of 20\u2013160 km (Weinert et al., 2007b, Eicher, 2010, ZM, 2013) appear to be sufficient for urban operations, where trips typically remain within a distance of 10 km (e.g., Weinert et al., 2007c, Hendriksen et al., 2008, ITRANS, 2009, Delcampe, 2010, Paffumi et al., 2013).

However, a multidisciplinary analysis that reviews and expands the established knowledge on electric two-wheelers is still missing. Here, we address this gap and provide an overview of the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers. Our analysis focuses predominantly on e-bikes for two reasons. First, the bulk of the literature on electric two-wheelers addresses this vehicle category. Second, e-bikes outsell globally any other category of electric two-wheelers and currently seize a rapidly growing market in Europe. The results of our research can provide rationale for (i) designing energy and transportation policies and (ii) advancing vehicle technology and urban transportation infrastructure with the objective of making road transportation more sustainable.",

To this end, we establish estimates for the mean price, as well as mean price differential between electric-two wheelers and conventional two-wheelers, based on the data samples shown in Tables S3\u2013S7 (see Supplemental Material). To quantify the cost decline in the manufacturing of e-bikes, we conduct an experience curve analysis (Henderson, 1974). We separately model the absolute price [EUR2012] and the specific price [EUR2012\n kW h\u22121] of e-bikes as well as the price differential [EUR2012] between e-bikes and bicycles [P(xt)] as a power-law function of the cumulative global e-bike production [number of vehicles] as:(1)P(xt)=P(x0)\u00d7xtx0bwhere P(x\n0) represents each of the three price parameters expressed in Euro less value-added tax, deflated to the base year 2012; x\n0 and xt represent the cumulative global e-bike production at starting point 0 and at the end point t of our analysis; b represents the experience index. By plotting experience curves on a double-logarithmic scale, we obtain a linear curve with b as slope parameter. We calculate for each experience curve the learning rate LR (%) that represents the percentage change of the respective price parameter with each doubling of cumulative production:(2)LR=(1-2b)\u00d7100%\n",

The focus on Germany and the Netherlands is justified because these two countries together constitute 65% of the European e-bike market (Colibi and Coliped, 2014).

By 2005, the Chinese e-bike fleet counted 120 million and outnumbered by far the fleet of 80 million conventionally-powered scooters (Weinert et al., 2007c). With e-bike sales reaching 28 million units in 2012 (estimate based on Bento, 2012), China comprises 90% of both, the 31 million e-bikes yearly sold and the 150 million e-bikes used worldwide (Jamerson and Benjamin, 2013). Factors driving the market penetration of e-bikes in China include (Weinert, 2007, Weinert et al., 2007a, Weinert et al., 2007c, Weinert et al., 2008, Cherry, 2010):\u2022Legislative support: gasoline-powered two-wheelers were banned in 148 Chinese cities in 2006 following air quality concerns; policy intervention made bicycle-style and scooter-style e-bikes compete mostly against public transportation or bicycles; the introduction of performance standards that classify e-bikes as bicycles if these weigh less than 40 kg and have a maximum speed of 20 km h\u22121 allowed consumers to use e-bikes without a driver\u2019s licence and vehicle registration on a designated bicycle infrastructure; performance standards and vehicle legislation were loosely enforced on larger electric two-wheelers.\u2022Technological improvement: Between 1990 and 2006, the introduction of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries increased the energy density by 30% and the battery life time by 160%, resulting in larger drive ranges and lower maintenance costs; the introduction of brushless motors and neodymium magnets increased the lifetime, power output, and efficiency of electric motors.\u2022Price reduction: E-bike prices declined by one third between 1999 and 2006 (Bento, 2012) driven by technological learning, innovation, economies of scale, and enhancing market competition.\u2022Favorable transportation infrastructure: Public transportation appeared often inconvenient, while individual transportation suffered from road congestions. At the same time, a dedicated bicycle infrastructure was available in many cities.\u2022Favorable socio-economic and cultural conditions: Decreasing electricity prices and increasing gasoline prices have been accompanied by rising household income and an increasing need for mobility. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 accelerated the mode shift from public transportation to e-bikes, supported by a wide-spread cycling culture.\n",

Compared to conventionally-powered two-wheelers, the environmental impacts of electric two-wheelers are shifted from vehicle use to vehicle production, end-of-life treatment, and electricity generation. Electric two-wheelers, just as battery-electric cars, shift the environmental impacts of motorized transport away from numerous and difficult-to-control vehicles to less numerous and more concentrated point sources, predominantly located outside of urban areas (Cherry, 2007). Such relocation decreases human exposure to pollution, and can be expected, ceteris paribus, to decrease the detrimental health impacts of road transportation (Cherry, 2007, Ji et al., 2012). However, caution is necessary because mode-shift behavior matters: Electric two-wheelers could increase energy use and come at an environmental burden when replacing bicycles or public transportation instead of conventionally-powered two-wheelers or cars.",

Moreover, conversion losses can vary greatly among regions depending on the electricity mix and the efficiency of power plants. Chiu and Tzeng (1999) find that electric two-wheelers in Taiwan, with largely fossil-based electricity generation, reach a well-to-wheel efficiency of about 15%, which is similar to the efficiency of conventionally-powered motorcycles. Weinert et al. (2008) report for China a well-to-wheel energy use of small electric two-wheelers (7 \u00b1 1 kW h 100 km\u22121) that is substantially lower than that of conventionally-powered two-wheelers (29 kW h 100 km\u22121). The regional variability in both electricity mix and power plant efficiency demands a case-by-case assessment of the well-to-wheel energy use of electric two-wheelers. The majority of the well-to-wheel energy use of electric two-wheeler can be attributed to the well-to-tank stage, contrasting the situation for conventionally-powered vehicles that tend to consume three-fourths of their well-to-wheel energy use in the tank-to-wheel stage.",

            "text": "Whether electric two-wheelers can decrease the energy demand and the environmental impacts of road transportation depends on the actual mode-shift behavior of consumers. The empirical insight into mode-shift behavior remains partial and largely case specific. Still, literature suggests that consumers substitute e-bikes to a considerable extent for bicycles and public transportation and tend to undertake trips they would not have done in the absence of e-bikes (Table A3 in Appendix). Such mode-shift behavior appears to increase consumer well-being but diminishes environmental benefits that would emerge if e-bikes and larger electric two-wheelers substituted conventionally-powered two-wheelers or passenger cars only. To illustrate the case: Assuming the mode shift behavior observed by Dekker (2013) in two cities of the Netherlands\n4, e-bikes can save 286 \u00b1 83 GW h (44 \u00b1 61 kt CO2-eq.) compared to the current transportation pattern. These savings are, however, 50 \u00b1 50% lower than the potential energy saving of 533 \u00b1 208 GW h and 60 \u00b1 120% lower than the potential CO2 emission savings of 102 \u00b1 91 kt CO2-eq. that could be achieved if e-bikes solely replaced conventionally-powered two-wheelers. Thus, mode shift in not negligible and should be accounted for when evaluating the environmental impacts of electric two-wheelers. This, in turn, necessitates case-specific analyses. Finally, electric two-wheelers can only decrease the energy use and environmental impacts of road transportation if they penetrate the market at a large scale. Whether this is likely to happen depends, among others, on their economic performance, which we address next.",

These preliminary findings suggest higher relative price differentials for e-bikes and mid-size electric two-wheelers than for battery-electric cars (320 \u00b1 210 EUR2012\n kW\u22121; Weiss et al., 2012). The absolute price differentials of e-bikes (1300 \u00b1 700 EUR2012), mid-size electric two-wheelers (1200 \u00b1 1400 EUR2012), and large electric two-wheelers (4000 \u00b1 2100 EUR2012) are, however, lower than those of battery-electric cars because the former are equipped with smaller batteries. The relatively low absolute price differential may explain the rapid market penetration of e-bikes that offer an obvious additional use value compared to bicycles, i.e., power assistance. The additional use value of e-scooters and e-motorcycles, e.g., the availability of low-end torque for strong acceleration may be less apparent to consumers and may not yet justify the present price differentials.",

The learning rates for the price of e-bikes in China and the specific price of e-bikes in Germany and the Netherlands are similar to those of hybrid-electric cars (7 \u00b1 2%; Weiss et al., 2012) and lithium-ion batteries (6\u20139%; Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015) but lower than the average learning rate of energy-demand technologies (18 \u00b1 9%; Weiss et al., 2010).",

Battery production costs range from 25\u201340 EUR2012\n kW h\u22121 for lead-acid batteries (Budde-Meiwes et al., 2013) to 230\u2013310 EUR2012\n kW h\u22121 for lithium-ion batteries (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015).

In fact, travel speed appears to be a main factor explaining why consumers prefer electric and conventionally-powered two-wheelers over alternative transportation modes (Cherry and Cervero, 2007, Montgomery, 2010, Kopp, 2011). With respect to electric two-wheelers, case studies indicate that e-bikes are faster than bicycles and buses in Kunming (China) but 11% slower than conventionally-powered scooters in Shanghai (China; Cherry, 2007). E-bike trips in the Netherlands are 1.5 times longer (9.8 km) than bicycle trips, suggesting mobility benefits for citizens. The use of two-wheelers in general faces practical constraints. Literature suggests that workers in business attire, as well as citizens in need of transporting goods, commuting in the dark, or faced with bad weather are less likely to commute by bicycle (Heinen et al., 2011). The number of bicycle trips appears to increase over car trips with rising temperature and sunshine duration. Although these findings address bicycle use, similar effects are likely to apply to electric and conventionally-powered two-wheelers.",

Users of two-wheelers are vulnerable in case of an accident (Weinert et al., 2007a, Haworth, 2012). Death rates per distance travelled are globally 30 times higher (Johnston et al., 2008, Haworth, 2012) and in the EU 18 times higher for powered two-wheeler users than for car drivers (EC, 2010).

Although we consider our results to be robust, updating part of the presented data is recommended. Second, we assume average carbon intensities of the electricity mix when estimating the carbon emissions of electric two-wheelers. This assumption is made based on data availability, but it simplifies reality. The electricity demand of new electric two-wheelers would likely be satisfied by marginal electricity that is potentially produced by outdated and inefficient power plants that would otherwise be taken off the grid. If so, we may underestimate the primary energy use and carbon emissions associated with electric two-wheelers. Third, the presented experience curves are subject to a range of uncertainties, including heterogeneity of the analyzed technology and the use of prices as proxy for production costs (see Weiss et al., 2010).",

Currently, electric two-wheelers are more expensive than their conventional counterparts. In spite of persisting price differentials, e-bikes have been penetrating the market because they offer an apparent additional use value (i.e., power assistance) as compared to bicycles. Larger electric two-wheelers do not offer such an apparent additional use value and may only penetrate the market if conditions change (e.g., fuel price, taxation, and infrastructure). Our research demonstrates that technological learning has been reducing the price differential between e-bikes and bicycles in the past decade. Similar dynamics are likely to also reduce the price differentials of larger electric two-wheelers and battery-electric cars. Technological learning in the manufacturing of electric two-wheelers can also generate spill-over to the benefit of novel ultra-light three- and four-wheel vehicles. In view of widespread urban traffic congestions, the mobility benefits offered by electric two-wheelers may provide scope for policy intervention, e.g., through the introduction of access taxes for conventional cars and two-wheelers or the establishment of environmental driving zones. These measures could be complemented by:\u2022the establishment of a dedicated infrastructure (Lamy, 2001);\u2022taxation that lowers the relative costs of electric two-wheelers;\u2022the provision of parking and recharging infrastructure (Chiu and Tzeng, 1999) and effective anti-theft protection (Lamy, 2001).\n",

However, immediate market potential exists only for e-bikes; persisting price differentials and the absence of an obvious additional use value appear to present a barrier for the market penetration of mid-size and large electric two-wheelers. We derive the following conclusions:\u2022If Europe is to decrease transport-related carbon dioxide emissions, urban noise and air pollution, and inner city traffic, policy makers should consider supporting electric two-wheelers.\u2022Given the regional variability in, e.g., the electricity mix, mode-shift behavior, infrastructure characteristics, and geographic and climatic conditions, the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers should be assessed on a case-specific basis by taking an integrated approach to urban mobility.\u2022The boom of bicycle-style and scooter-style e-bikes in China suggest that a mandatory phase out of conventionally-powered two-wheelers from urban environments is an effective measure to increase the market penetration of electric two-wheelers (Yang, 2010).\u2022Technological learning has been decreasing the price differential of e-bikes and will likely continue to decrease absolute prices and price differentials of all categories of electric two-wheelers. Battery costs will have to decline substantially before mid-size and large electric two-wheelers will penetrate the market at large scale.\u2022A shift from cars and conventionally-powered two-wheelers to electric two-wheelers will necessitate adaptations of the existing transport and electricity infrastructure and the management of newly emerging safety issues, e.g., through the introduction of dedicated drive lanes and minimum noise requirements.\u2022The battery capacity of the global electric two-wheelers fleet (125 \u00b1 42 GW h) exceeds that of battery-electric cars (4 \u00b1 2 GW h) by a factor of 30 and constitutes a huge reservoir for technological learning, economies of scale, spill-over effects from which economy-wide battery applications in general and the electrification of transport in particular could benefit.\n",
