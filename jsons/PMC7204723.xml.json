Due to an increased demand in SARS-CoV-2 screenings, alternative protocols with similar sensitivity were needed ([8], [9], [10], [11]). Thus, we compared sensitivity from Health Canada approved SeeGene AllplexTM 2019-nCoV rRT-QPCR Assay (thereafter SeeGene) and Altona, with and without RNA extraction. Samples originated from remaining swabs media and RNA extracts from symptomatic individuals that had been previously screened using the CIUSS-MCQ routine method.

Next, we measured the stability of the detection in 5 additional samples by amplifying from fresh (stored at 4 \u00b0C), frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C overnight, thawed and stored at 4 \u00b0C for 3 days (T0, T24, T48 and T72) (Fig. 3B). Ct values remained constant across the experiment and all samples could be detected at all timepoints.

First, we used extracted and purified RNA from five positive specimens (Ct between 12,61 and 14,22) that we diluted using saline or water and used for rRT-PCR. All five samples were detected by the N target when diluted in saline or in water. However, when samples were stored in saline, Ct for the N gene were above 30 compared to a mean of 22 when RNA was diluted in water following SeeGene. The E gene could not be amplified from saline dilutions (Fig. 4\na). These results suggest that saline is not compatible with direct rRT-PCR. We assessed the sensitivity in water and diluted a positive swab by performing five serial dilutions (each 1:10) from this swab. These dilutions were also used for RNA extraction and amplification using the standard procedure. The undiluted sample and 4 of 5 dilutions showed detectable levels of using N gene and S gene, with both Altona and SeeGene. Ct values of the E gene and of the N gene were similar whether RNA was extracted or not, and whether SeeGene or Altona was used (Fig. 4b).",

Twenty-seven of them could be amplified post-thawing when RNA or swabs were used with Altona\u2019s multiplex assay. Thirty-two could be detected from RNA eluates or directly from swabs with SeeGene\u2019s multiplex assay (Fig. 5b). The initial Ct mean (before freezing) of samples that were lost following thawing was significantly higher than the Ct mean of samples that could be amplified (25,7 vs 33,7; p < 0.0001; unpaired t-test) using Altona and SeeGene (25,97 vs 35,68; p < 0.0001; unpaired t-test). This suggests that storing specimens in water at -80\u00b0C can lead to a significant sensitivity loss for low viral load samples. Direct rRT-PCR was as efficient as RNA extraction followed by rRT-PCR to detect positive samples using both methods. In addition, Ct values of the internal control was significantly higher using direct rRT-PCR compared to rRT-PCR from purified RNA with Altona (p = 0.0002, paired t-test), suggesting PCR inhibition when RNA is not purified which was not observed with SeeGene. From this experiment, we conclude that RNA extraction can be successfully skipped when swabs are collected in molecular water. However, storing samples at \u221280 \u00b0C collected in water before screening could impact the sensitivity and a decrease detection of patients with lower viral loads.",
