Since children are less than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based practice recommendations. The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020. Results were analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics. Results Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were identified. Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3). Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines. Conclusions As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available. This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.

            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. [1] [2] [3] The rapid worldwide spread of severeacute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related disease has led to its designation as a global health emergency. [2] By early March 2020, more than 100,000 infections and more than 4000 deaths worldwide were attributable to COVID-19. [4, 5] Most available information on COVID-19 currently stems from the Chinese experience, ultimately characterized by aggressive and uniform public health responses. [6, 7] In contrast, the federalized European states have not introduced uniform countermeasures, which may render their responses more comparable to the US than to the more centralized Chinese public health response. [6, 7] As fewer than 1% of reported COVID-19 cases have been children, information about COVID-19 in the pediatric population is sparse. [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] The majority of available information concerns the major risk populations, including adults with significant comorbidities and the elderly. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Consequently, there is an urgent need for information to guide the management of other patient populations. Development of such guidance is especially challenging in highly specialized fields with small target populations, such as pediatric nephrologists caring for children with kidney transplants, receiving dialysis, or being treated with immunosuppressive therapy for kidney disease. There is significant concern that such patients are more likely to develop severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet, they may have an increased risk of exposure due to the need to have ongoing clinical care, including dialysis and laboratory monitoring. The current pandemic provides a challenge to the international community to develop new approaches for rapid analysis and dissemination of information to guide the management of patients with unique healthcare needs.",

In contrast to other datagathering techniques, Delphi studies use feedback processes (iterations), to develop a consensus concerning a specific topic. This allows participants to reassess their initial judgments at a later time based on information provided earlier. [24] The first Delphi round started with an open email invitation to all EPDWG members to share their current knowledge, experience, information, and guidance for COVID-19 prevention, diagnostics, and management in their target population. Replies were gathered for 24 h. Information provided by the EPDWG members was analyzed using a modified form of meaning condensation analysis. [27, 28] Email replies were first read through to gain an overview of the collected data, after which themes were extracted and clustered according to common meanings. Clustered themes and corresponding quotations for each center were synthesized in a summary of finding table sent to all participants. Thus, participants could see the findings for each theme and center, including their own. The goal of the second Delphi round was to edit the wording, propose amendments, and check correctness of the summaries extracted from the experts' statements. A summary of findings containing the final version of clustered themes and participants' quotations for each center was created. In the third Delphi round, participants were asked to complete information on existing themes they had not addressed previously. Replies from rounds 2 and 3 were collected within 48 h. After the third Delphi round, no new information emerged and data saturation was achieved. Modified meaning condensation analysis [27, 28] was further utilized to formulate thematic questions and accompanying answer statements to systematically categorize the whole range of the specific, gathered knowledge. A set of clustered thematic questions and answer statements was created (Table 1) . For the fourth Delphi round, this thematic question and answer statement set was circulated, and experts were asked to rate each statement with \"total agreement\" or \"no agreement\" in accordance with their local practice. We did not aim at consensus due to the descriptive character of our Delphi exercise, but rather aimed for rapid sharing of knowledge and practices to allow improved guidance of local management.",

[12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This lack of targeted clinical evidence will likely not change within highly specialized fields, such as all pediatric subspecialties. For example, in the recently published pediatric COVID-19 case series (almost exclusively based on Chinese data), no cases of children with kidney transplantation or on dialysis were reported. [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] In this context, expert knowledge, experience, and guidance may provide the best available \"evidence\". Since COVID-19-specific reports of children with kidney disease, kidney transplantation, or dialysis were unavailable, as was guidance from respective professional societies, we conducted a Delphi exercise among experts in pediatric nephrology, representing 13 centers in 11 European countries (including two Italian centers).

[30, 31] For example, testing of symptomatic patients was uniformly performed in all centers as mandated by health authorities. However, testing of asymptomatic patients and asymptomatic HCP with varying risk factors markedly varied among EPDWG centers, likely reflecting decisions of individual expert teams responsible for clinical care, thus influenced by local expert attitudes and hospital policies. It is important to stress that criteria and strategies for COVID-19 testing are changing rapidly as the geographic spread of COVID-19 expands, as are physician attitudes and hospital policies. In accordance with current literature [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] , our study found no cases of confirmed COVID-19 in children with dialysis. However, we identified the first case of confirmed COVID-19 in a child with kidney transplantation in Spain. This child was doing well at the time of manuscript submission.",

Local hospital policies, physicians' attitudes, and available resources also significantly influenced the diverse patterns of responses among EPDWG centers. Future studies, performing detailed longitudinal assessments of these interdependent variables will be needed to obtain a deeper understanding of determinants of individual response patterns. Such studies should be able to compare the efficacy of any country-specific responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The concise description of multi-country European response patterns may allow experts in other countries affected by this pandemic to base their own responses on an improved level of evidence for recommendations unavailable for the time being through standard methodologies. The COVID-19 pandemic is expanding in the United States with a lag of about 2 weeks compared to continental Europe. [4] This lag may provide crucial opportunities for US experts to learn from the European areas enduring a more advanced state of the pandemic.",

The use of a mixed method qualitative approach allowed retrieval of evidence on international clinical response patterns within an extremely short time. In times at which quantitative data and corresponding evidence under given circumstances is scarce, qualitative expert knowledge, experience, and guidance may be the best evidence available. These principles will apply to every situation in which quantitative evidence is lacking in the setting of an emerging international pandemic threat.",
