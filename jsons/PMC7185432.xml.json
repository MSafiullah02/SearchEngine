            "text": "The OAS/RNase L system, discovered in the 1970s, was one of the first characterized interferon (IFN) effector pathways. The pioneering work of P. Lengyel's and I. Kerr's groups revealed a cellular RNase whose activity depended on IFN and correlated with the synthesis of 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylates (2\u20135A) in infected cells. This led to the model presented in Figure 1\n, where IFN induces the expression of oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) that synthesize 2\u20135A in response to viral infection. 2\u20135A act as second messengers to trigger dimerization and activation of latent RNase L. Activated RNase L cleaves viral and cellular single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and thereby limits virus replication and triggers the apoptosis of infected cells.",

The three OAS (OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3) differ in their number of OAS domains, oligomerization level and type of synthesized 2\u20135A. In addition to OAS, human and mouse genomes encode \u2018OAS-like\u2019 (OASL) proteins. The unique human OASL is catalytically inactive. In mice, Oasl1 is inactive while Oasl2 can synthesize 2\u20135A (reviewed in [4, 5]). Binding of dsRNA triggers the catalytic activity of OAS, which convert ATP into 2\u20135A. 2\u20135A are short oligoadenylates linked by 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiester bonds, whose general formula is [pxA(2\u2032p5\u2032A)n; x\n = 1\u20133; n\n \u2265 2] [6, 7]. The only known function of 2\u20135A is RNase L activation [8].",

It is described as a cytosolic enzyme, but is also detected in other subcellular compartments such as mitochondria where it regulates mitochondrial mRNA abundance [3, 9]. RNase L comprises three domains: (i) a N-terminal ankyrin domain composed of 9 ankyrin repeats (R1\u2013R9) involved in 2\u20135A recognition; (ii) a central catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain which contributes to RNase L dimerization; and (iii) a C-terminal enzymatic domain that cleaves target RNA. Recent structural studies show that 2\u20135A bind R2 and R4 of one RNase L protomer, and R9 and the pseudokinase N-terminal lobe of the other, thereby triggering RNase L dimerization [10\u2022\u2022, 11, 12\u2022\u2022]. RNase L cleaves viral and cellular ssRNA with little specificity (UN^N sequence), leaving a 5\u2032-OH and 3\u2032-monophosphate [10\u2022\u2022].",

This is indeed the case for some OAS, which have RNase L-independent antiviral activity [38\u2022, 39]. For example, upon dsRNA binding, the catalytically inactive human OASL can activate RIG-I. Even more surprising is the intensity of 2\u20135A production since these compounds have a unique known function, the activation of RNase L [8]. First, it is possible that 2\u20135A have another function. Second, the use of 2\u20135A as second messengers may allow tight regulation of RNase L, as 2\u20135A are quickly degraded by phosphodiesterases. Third, some analogy exists between the OAS/RNase L pathway and the cGAS-STING pathway, which leads to IFN expression. Both involve the synthesis of non-canonical nucleotides acting as second messengers: 2\u20135A for OAS/RNase L and cyclic AMP-GMP for the cGAS/STING pathway. Cyclic AMP\u2013GMP can be transferred between cells, in a gap junction-dependent manner, to activate IFN synthesis in neighboring cells [40\u2022\u2022]. 2\u20135A could similarly signal to neighboring cells to prime the RNase L-mediated positive feed-back into the IFN response.",

(a) IFN secreted upon viral infection activates the transcription of hundreds of genes including oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) genes. dsRNA resulting from viral replication switches on OAS, which convert ATP into 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylates (2\u20135A). 2\u20135A then bind to RNase L and trigger its dimerization and activation. RNase L degrades single-stranded viral and cellular RNA, decreasing viral replication and inducing apoptosis. (b,c) Schematic (b) and crystallographic structure (PDB ref 4OAV) (c) of active dimeric human RNase L, showing 2\u20135A bound to two RNase L protomers. 2\u20135A bind ankyrin repeats 2 and 4 of the first protomer and ankyrin repeat 9 of the other protomer (as well as the N-terminal lobe of the pseudokinase domain).",

Influenza virus NS1, mouse hepatitis virus ns2 and Theiler's virus L* proteins are examples that act on different steps of the pathway. NS1 is a broad spectrum inhibitor that acts upstream, by sequestering dsRNA. It therefore concomitantly inhibits other antiviral pathways that depend on dsRNA such as PKR, Mda5 and TLR3. ns2 degrades 2\u20135A and thus acts downstream of OAS. It is unclear whether 2\u20135A have functions other than RNase L activation. L* directly interacts with RNase L, which ensures a specific effect.",
