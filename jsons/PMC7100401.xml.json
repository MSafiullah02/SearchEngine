            "text": "Tybur et al. (2009) propose that there are three domains of disgust (i.e., pathogen, moral, and sexual), each of which is elicited from distinct stimuli and serves a particular function, but has a similar affective state of repulsion. Pathogen disgust is elicited in response to physical stimuli, such as mold, open wounds, and other vehicles of disease transmission, for which the emotional response protects against the ingestion of substances that may be physically harmful to the self (Neuberg et al. 2011; Rozin and Fallon 1987). For example, people who see mold on their food likely will experience pathogen disgust and, thus, remove themselves from the food by disposing of it in a trashcan. Pathogen disgust is particularly likely to be elicited within contexts in which pathogen threat is either immediately present or primed. Therefore, in situations where contagion is a salient threat, people are likely to behave in ways that diminish their risk (Tybur et al. 2014). An example can be seen through the general public\u2019s reaction to the recent coronavirus outbreak. Persistent media messages of contagion appear to have created avoidance of public areas and aversions to interpersonal contact, and they may have even contributed to prejudicial attitudes toward individuals who are perceived as infected (e.g., Chinese-Americans; Kesslen et al. 2020; Kwai 2020). Pathogen disgust, in this context, may be the mechanism through which environment harvests behavior.",

For example, observing a political leader deliberately manipulating constituents may elicit moral disgust and motivate negative attitudes toward, or removal of, the leader. Disgust in response to a moral violation is thought to promote avoidant behaviors toward violators because those who engage in immoral behaviors may be incapable of providing the reciprocity of benefits that are expected of in-group members. Instead, violators may be perceived to engage in costly interpersonal behaviors, such as stealing from, lying to, or more severe immoral behaviors such as killing (Tybur et al. 2009). Thus, avoidance of the violator may be self-protective. Within cultural contexts that are heavily influenced by religious ideology, such as politically conservative regions, sensitivity to moral disgust is prevalent (Rozin and Haidt 2013). This may be because religious and conservative communities often have larger variability in the types of behaviors that are perceived as immoral, relative to more secular and liberal communities (Haidt and Graham 2007). Therefore, moral disgust appears to be influenced by the stringency of traditional moral values.",

(2009) suggest that sexual disgust is elicited from sexual stimuli and partners who may be biologically costly for reproductive success. Other researchers, however, offer a counter-conceptualization that may be favorable for researchers adopting a sociocultural perspective. Morrison et al. (2018) suggest sexual disgust is likely to be elicited among people who possess rigid notions of sexuality. Thus, sexual stimuli and behavior that fall outside of culturally normative conceptualizations of sexuality are likely to elicit sexual disgust. For example, men who engage in sexual activity with other men may elicit sexual disgust among people who rigidly adhere to traditional notions of sexuality. Therefore, cultural contexts in which there are stern sexuality and gender norms are likely to have high prevalence of sexual disgust sensitivity. When sexual disgust is elicited, it would be expected to promote interpersonal avoidance and hostile attitudes because associating with individuals who engage in behaviors outside traditional sexuality may be a threat to self-status within a social hierarchy (Kiss et al. 2018; this perspective is described in more detail in the following). Because we are primarily theorizing from a sociocultural perspective, we refer to sexual disgust as the conceptualization proposed by Morrison et al. (2018) moving forward.",

            "text": "Disgust as an emotional response to gay men is a phenomenon that has recently gained attention in the psychological and sociological literature. Initial work examining antigay attitudes suggests disgust is a common reaction to gay men and may reflect a prominent emotion in response to homosexuality (Herek 1986, 1988, 1993). Indeed, Embrick et al. (2007) identified disgust as a theme in qualitative interviews exploring working class men\u2019s attitudes toward homosexuality in the workplace. More recently, research has begun to examine the outcomes of such emotional arousal. Several studies have presented results suggesting that people with increased disgust sensitivity report more antigay attitudes (Crawford et al. 2014; Inbar et al. 2009; Olatunji 2008; Terrizzi et al. 2010) and that the manipulation of disgust can amplify negative attitudes toward sexual minorities (Cunningham et al. 2013; Inbar et al. 2012). Meta-analytic findings have highlighted the robust association between disgust and antigay attitudes, with results indicating a moderate-to-large effect across studies (Kiss et al. 2018). Interestingly, there is some evidence to suggest that the effect of disgust on attitudes is larger in response to gay men than to lesbian women (Cunningham et al. 2013; Inbar et al. 2012), which may partially explain society\u2019s generally greater dislike of gay men compared to lesbian women (Bettinsoli et al. 2019). Therefore, further research attentive to the influence of disgust on prejudicial attitudes toward gay men, in particular, seems warranted.",

            "text": "Researchers have sought to develop a theoretical framework to explain the particular function of disgust in response to gay men. Most research in the current literature utilizes the framework proposed by the behavioral immune system (Schaller 2006; Schaller and Park 2011). Theorists suggest that over the course of evolution, humans have developed a behavioral immune system to protect against novel pathogens that could cause harm. This cognitive system is tasked with identifying contamination threats and initiating cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses that serve to mitigate such threats (Schaller and Park 2011). The primary way in which the behavioral immune system evokes adaptive behavioral responses is through the elicitation of emotion (Neuberg et al. 2011; Schaller and Park 2011). Situations in which there are contamination threats\u2014such as interpersonal contact with unfamiliar groups\u2014are likely to elicit disgust, which would motivate the development of hostile attitudes and behavioral avoidance (Schaller and Park 2011). These outcomes would be evolutionarily adaptive because they would decrease the likelihood of being exposed to deadly pathogens, which would bode in favor of the individual\u2019s reproductive fitness and eventual reproductive success (Cottrell and Neuberg 2005). Proponents of the behavioral immune system suggest the framework can be adapted to explain disgust in response to gay men as well as subsequent antigay attitudes (Crawford et al. 2014; Inbar et al. 2009; Inbar et al. 2012; Terrizzi et al. 2010). Specifically, gay men may be perceived as vectors of parasites and their presence could evoke disgust as a mechanism to create boundaries (Crawford et al. 2014; Inbar et al. 2012; Terrizzi et al. 2010). The development of hostile attitudes would then aid behavioral avoidance by decreasing the likelihood of interpersonal contact with gay men (Inbar et al. 2012; Terrizzi et al. 2010).",

In the following we focus on the latter explanation. We outline a theoretical framework and describe an empirical study that tested the strength of association between the three domains of disgust and subsequent hostile attitudes.",

Theories concerned with group-based social hierarchies, such as social dominance theory (Pratto et al. 2006; Sidanius and Pratto 1999), suggest social hierarchies can be arbitrarily structured to systematically privilege or discriminate against groups based on characteristics such as race/ethnicity, nationality, religion, or sexual orientation. Several distinct social hierarchies (i.e., based on discrete attributes) can concurrently exist within a single society (Pratto et al. 2006). Each hierarchy is legitimized and justified through ideology (often referred to as \u201clegitimizing myths\u201d) that is deeply embedded in social institutions, intergroup processes, and individual attitudes (Herek 2007, 2016; Pratto et al. 2006). For example, ideology operating to justify social hierarchical structures can be reflected through governmental regulations or policies, preferential treatment of dominant group members, and individual prejudices or stigma toward \u201csubordinate\u201d or minority group members (Herek 2007, 2016; Herek and McLemore 2013; Pratto et al. 2006; Sidanius et al. 1994). Such ideologies, and their subsequent outcomes, are expected to disproportionately benefit the dominant group\u2014compared to subordinated groups\u2014at all levels of society (i.e., social institutions, intergroup processes, individual attitudes) in ways that serve to maintain dominate groups members\u2019 status atop the social hierarchy (Herek 2016; Jost and Banaji 1994; Pratto et al. 2006).",

Heteronormativity can be conceptualized as an institutionalized social force that dictates acceptable behaviors based on the assumption that heterosexuality is normal (Habarth 2014; Kitzinger 2005; Yep 2003). That is, heteronormativity defines boundaries of \u201cnormality\u201d and sets expectations for men and women to behave and express themselves in accordance with traditional gender norms (Habarth 2014). Although gender norms include general notions\u2014such that men and women are expected to behave in a \u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine\u201d manner, respectively\u2014they also assume that men and women engage in heterosexual relationships and sexual behavior (Habarth 2014; Kitzinger 2005). In this way, individuals who strongly internalize heteronormative ideals conceptually intertwine gender and sexuality. Thus, heteronormative men are likely to perceive that they must engage in sexual behavior with women, and not men, in order to be sufficiently masculine (Herek 1986; Kitzinger 2005). Those who engage in behaviors outside of heteronormative ideals\u2014such as people who engage in same-sex sexual behavior (e.g., gay men)\u2014are presumed to be inferior, which could be used to justify their lower status (relative to heterosexual people) within a social hierarchy (Herek 2007, 2016; Whitley and \u00c6gisd\u00f3ttir 2000).",

First, gay men may serve as a threat to the stability of society and social institutions that have historically favored heterosexuality (Kiss et al. 2018; Nagoshi et al. 2019; Whitley and \u00c6gisd\u00f3ttir 2000). Because gay men engage in sexual behavior that violates heteronormativity (i.e., same-sex sexual behavior), they could be seen to disrupt the ideology that maintains the arbitrarily set social hierarchy. This may be threatening\u2014particularly among dominant group members who strongly adhere to heteronormative ideology\u2014due to the more recent inclusion of gay men in American culture and institutions. Specifically, the inclusion of gay men in social institutions that had been previously reserved for heterosexual people (e.g., marriage) imply that norms are shifting and there is heightened openness to sexual behavior that falls outside the realm of heteronormativity. The credibility and inclusion of gay men is further evidenced by the recent historic presidential run by the first openly gay candidate, Pete Buttigieg (Fitzsimons 2020). Such a shift in norms could subsequently alter the social hierarchy in ways that no longer give structural preference to heterosexual people (Kiss et al. 2018; Nagoshi et al. 2019).",

Nagoshi et al. (2019) explain that others\u2019 deviations from normative gender behavior are a threat to the social status of the observer. This may be because heteronormative ideology prescribes stringent gender and sexuality norms (e.g., exclusive engagement in other-sex sexual behavior) for which men are expected to adhere if they wish to be considered sufficiently masculine by societal standards (Herek 1986). In some cases, proximity with violators of heteronormativity (e.g., gay men) may increase the likelihood of being misclassified as gay, thus threating the masculinity and social status of nearby heterosexual men. Consequently, heterosexual men may seek to avoid (Bosson et al. 2006; Bosson et al. 2011; Buck et al. 2013) or differentiate themselves from gay men by displaying antigay attitudes or behaviors (Bosson et al. 2011; Herek 2016; Parrott 2009; Parrott and Zeichner 2008), which would assist in preserving their individual status within a heteronormative social hierarchy.

Thus, disgust would serve to exclude lower-status groups from social institutions and enhance group-based social hierarchies in favor of the dominant group. However, disgust reactions are stronger in response to gay men than many other social groups (Cottrell and Neuberg 2005; Crawford et al. 2014; Tapias et al. 2007), suggesting the emotion of disgust may be selectively induced in response to \u201cthreatening\u201d social groups holding specific characteristics.",

Therefore, it seems sexual behavior that is beyond cultural norms may be particularly disgust-eliciting. In accordance with these data, it would be expected that gay men\u2019s sexual behavior would be the disgust-eliciting stimuli producing hostile attitudes. Within a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, gay men\u2019s sexual behavior is in stark contrast to the ideology that maintains it (i.e., heteronormativity) and, thus, may be perceived as deviant, impure, or abnormal (Crawford et al. 2014; Herek 2007, 2016).",

The current study tests these assumptions b examining the relationships among heteronormatively, disgust sensitivity, and antigay hostility. Based on frameworks proposed by group-based social hierarchical theories, we first hypothesized that sexual disgust sensitivity will statistically mediate the relationship between heteronormative ideology and hostility toward gay men (Hypothesis 1). Second, we expected that the indirect effect (i.e., statistical mediation) through sexual disgust would be significantly stronger than the indirect effects through pathogen disgust (Hypothesis 2) or moral disgust (Hypothesis 3). Finally, we hypothesized that heteronormativity will directly predict antigay hostility (Hypothesis 4).",

This suggests other fit indices may better capture model fit. Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA = .038), Comparative Fit Index (CFI = .987), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR = .036) were examined and determined the model fit the data well (Kline 2016).

Second, the partial statistical mediation of disgust sensitivity suggests the existence of other variables within the relationship between heteronormativity and antigay hostility. Similarly, the third variable problem may be present for which a variable that was not considered may fully account for the observed relationships. A further statistical limitation is that the measurement and structural models failed to achieve exact fit (i.e., a non-significant value for the Chi-square Test of Model Fit).",

MTurk tends to produce samples with higher levels of education and lower incomes than other online sampling methods (Levay et al. 2016). Additionally, the current data had an average political ideology value that significantly differed from the neutral midpoint (i.e., toward the liberal anchor); thus, the sample showed some evidence that it may have demographic deviations from the general population. Given the use of exclusively heterosexual men, it is unclear if the results could generalize to other groups of people (e.g., attitudes held by heterosexual women), which is another limitation. Last, although the association between disgust and antigay attitudes is robust (Kiss et al. 2018), the extent to which the emotion affects attitudes toward gay men in real world situations is unclear.",

First, for a full understanding of the phenomenon, it is important for future research to continue investigation into why disgust is elicited in response to gay men. We outline theory suggesting that gay men\u2019s sexual behavior may serve as a threat to status among heterosexual men. Experimental studies, such as those manipulating a masculinity threat from gay men, should consider measuring disgust as an outcome variable. This may provide additional evidence suggesting that one function of disgust is to enhance disparities in group-based social hierarchies.",

If gay men\u2019s sexual behavior is perceived to violate heteronormativity, thus eliciting disgust, we might expect exposure to violations (e.g., same-sex sexual behavior) to produce heightened levels of disgust. Experimental research could investigate this question by exposing participants to different levels of sexual contact between gay men and measuring participants\u2019 emotional responses, as well as their antigay attitudes. Such future research would be incredibly beneficial to the understanding of antigay attitudes and may ultimately inform interventions that could mitigate its prevalence.",

(2018), very little research has focused on perceptions of gay men\u2019s sexual behavior and how it relates to attitudes toward them. However, the results of the current study indicate that attitudes toward gay men are strongly associated with sexual disgust sensitivity, which suggests that the elicitation of disgust may be stemming from gay men\u2019s sexual behavior. Therefore, increased research attention should be devoted to understanding perceptions of gay men\u2019s sexual behavior and why it elicits disgust. We hypothesize that disgust is elicited because gay men\u2019s sexual behavior violates heteronormativity, and this speculation is supported by the observed relationship between heteronormativity and sexual disgust sensitivity. In addition to advancing understanding of links among heteronormativity, disgust, and antigay attitudes, the current study also contributes to the current literature more broadly, which suggests that emotions have the ability to affect judgments, attitudes, and behavior toward certain social groups (DeSteno et al. 2004), particularly those who elicit such emotions (Tapias et al. 2007).",

Because so little disgust research has examined social hierarchies, we sought to outline why disgust would be elicited in response to gay men and how it would serve a functional purpose in this context. More specifically, gay men\u2019s sexual behavior may elicit disgust among heterosexual men who strongly adhere to heteronormative ideology because it could threaten their social status. Subsequently, hostile attitudes may function to maintain the social hierarchy. Results more strongly support social hierarchical theoretical frameworks compared to the behavioral immune system.
