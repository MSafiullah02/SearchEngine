Recent immunosuppressive strategies have reduced acute rejection episodes and improved early cardiac graft survival\n[2]. However, these improvements did not ameliorate chronic allograft rejection, which remains an obstacle for better long-term heart transplant survival\n[3]. Chronic rejection of an allograft causes an intimal fibrosis in the vessels that leads to cardiac allograft vasculopathy\n[4]. Another consequence of chronic rejection and inflammation is cardiac fibrosis accompanied by increased stiffness of the heart and diminished contractility\n[5]. Ultimately, these fibrotic reactions can result in myocardial infarction or sudden death\n[4,6].",

            "text": "On a molecular level, fibrosis is associated with a disruption of the extracellular matrix and with deposition of extracellular collagen produced by myofibroblasts\n[5]. In various studies TGF-\u03b21 has been identified as the key cytokine orchestrating fibrosis development\n[7,8]. TGF-\u03b21 is produced by macrophages after stimulation by IL-13 via the IL-13R\u03b12 in the presence of IL-4 or TNF-\u03b1\n[9]. Further studies have shown that this pathway is a key initiation point for a complex fibrotic program in chronic TNBS colitis\n[10]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 inhibition ameliorates lung fibrosis, chronic allograft nephropathy, and also cardiac allograft fibrosis\n[11-13]. However, no effective therapy to prevent heart allograft fibrosis has been identified so far, possibly because ideal murine transplant models have been lacking to study potential targets and therapies. A mouse model for the examination of cardiac allograft fibrosis should enable long-term survival of a transplanted allograft and develop cardiac fibrosis in the setting of chronic rejection. Tanaka et al. have developed a transplantation model in which FVB (H-2q) donor hearts were placed into DBA/1 recipients that display a similar major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (H-2q), but different non-MHC genes (CD5, CD8a, NK1.1, and Thy-1)\n[14]. In this model, the heart allografts survive for up to more than 100 days without immunosuppression and developed graft coronary artery disease as the result of chronic rejection.",

            "text": "The study presented here shows increasing levels of IL-13 and IL-13+ cells within allografts of transplanted mice, in contrast to control mice receiving syngeneic grafts. Multiple studies have demonstrated that IL-13 is essential for the development of dermal, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary fibrosis, as well as fibro-obliterative lesions found in the bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) syndrome\n[9,10,17-20]. Consistent with these studies, IL-13R\u03b12 was detected only in the FVB allografts transplanted into DBA/1 recipients in our experiments. This receptor has been shown to link IL-13 signaling with further fibrotic downstream effects\n[9,21]. In follow-up, we detected elevated levels of TGF-\u03b21 in the mice receiving allogeneic grafts exclusively. Results from previous studies have indicated that TGF-\u03b21 is the key cytokine for development of allograft fibrosis in murine models and in humans, and that depletion of TGF-\u03b21 can prevent allograft fibrosis\n[7,12,22]. Other cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17 can modulate the TGF-\u03b21-mediated fibrotic reactions\n[7,8]. Additionally, a study by Faust et al. concluded that T cell TGF-\u03b2 signaling was required for the development of allograft fibrosis\n[8]. In parallel to the elevated levels of TGF-\u03b21, we found increased allograft-infiltration with CD11bhighGr1intermediateTGF-\u03b21+ cells in the DBA/1 mice transplanted with FVB allografts; it has been shown by our group and others that CD11bhighGr1intermediate cells are the main source for TGF-\u03b21 production\n[23-25]. In the allogeneic situation of the mouse model we used, activation of the profibrotic IL-13/TGF-\u03b21 interaction led to allograft fibrosis that was continuously increasing over time after transplantation.",

After treatment with IL-13R\u03b12 siRNA, an almost complete reduction of TGF-\u03b21 production by CD11bhighGr1intermediate cells (the main producers of TGF-\u03b21 in this model) was observed\n[24,25]. The reduction of TGF-\u03b21-producing cells and reduced TGF-\u03b21 levels consequently led to diminished collagen deposition in heart allografts and therefore reduced allograft fibrosis. Tregs were also considered as contributors to the TGF-\u03b21 effect. While CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs can produce TGF-\u03b21 to mediate their tolerogenic functions and expand induced regulatory T cells (iTregs), there was no difference in their numbers in control versus IL-13R\u03b12 siRNA-injected mice\n[26-29]. Notably, after therapy with IL-13R\u03b12 siRNA, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were found at levels that were similar to mice receiving syngeneic grafts, and were much lower than in allotransplanted mice not given IL-13R\u03b12 siRNA treatment.",

            "text": "For our investigations, we used a heterotopic murine heart transplantation model in which FVB hearts were placed in DBA/1 recipients. This chronic rejection model with minor multiple non-MHC mismatches has been used previously to study graft coronary artery disease\n[14]. We show that the FVB to DBA/1 model can also be used to examine allograft fibrosis. Over time, transplanted allografts are infiltrated by increasing numbers of CD4+, CD8+, and CD11b+ cells, a fact that was also observed by Tanaka et al. in the original description of this transplantation model\n[14]. We further demonstrated by PCR array that a 'fibrotic program\u2019 is active in this FVB to DBA/1 model. Profibrotic factors such as IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 that play a role in liver fibrosis development, and TNF-\u03b1 which is an essential cofactor of IL-13 to induce the expression of IL-13R\u03b12, were upregulated. Further, Ccl-12 and Cxcr-4 that were both shown to be involved in pulmonary fibrosis, Ccl-3 which has been described to be important in systemic sclerosis, and Ccr-2 that is associated with allograft fibrosis, were overexpressed\n[9,30-33]. Additionally, the PCR array showed upregulation of other influential molecules such as Fas/Fas ligand, which is important in the development of fibrotic lesions associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MMP-1 and MMP-13 (involved in remodeling processes occurring during fibrosis) and \u03b22-microglobuin were also overexpressed in the PCR array and positive in the immunohistochemistry of FVB allografts transplanted into DBA/1 recipients\n[34-36]. In contrast, genes like Gremlin-1 that may contribute to reversibility of lung fibrosis in rats, and Smad6 which in complex with Smurf-1 effectively attenuated TGF-\u03b21 signaling, were downregulated\n[37,38]. Altogether, these findings support the fact that this FVB to DBA/1 transplantation model is suitable not only to study graft coronary artery disease, but also to examine organ allograft fibrosis.",
