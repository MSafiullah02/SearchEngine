Exposure to particulate matter (PM) pollutants in the atmosphere increases risks for diseases in the respiratory and nervous systems and decreases life expectancy (Allen et al., 2013, Allen et al., 2014; Hunt et al., 2003; Maher et al., 2016; Pope 3rd et al., 2009; Weuve et al., 2012). As one of the major components and pathogenic agents, airborne microorganisms, such as bacteria, are considered to be closely related to air pollution that causes human allergic responses and respiratory diseases (Kim et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2016). Many studies have been carried out on airborne bacteria in environment (Fang et al., 2007). And it has been well documented that the air within hospitals or stock farms is highly contaminated with bacteria (Clark et al., 1983; Park et al., 2013; Solomon et al., 2017). Microorganisms are believed to have varying concentration in the ambient air depending on the pollution state (Liu et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Bacterial infections are becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance (AR or ABR), when bacteria evolve in response to antibiotics and make them ineffective. ABR is a global health crisis that leads to increased morbidity, mortality, and medical costs. In China, 92,700 tons of 36 frequently detected antibiotics were used, according to Zhang's investigation, and 53,800 tons of which eventually entered the environment (Zhang et al., 2015). The development of antibiotic resistance among bacteria has been facilitated by the misuse and abuse of antibiotics in humans and animals. Moreover, antibiotic resistance can be transferred between bacteria in environment (Allen et al., 2010; Hiltunen et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2019). Large amounts of antibiotic resistant genes were found in air samples from Beijing smog (Pal et al., 2016), causing great public concern and panic. The existence of antibiotic resistant genes indicates the potential for resistance to be transferred between bacteria in air (Xie et al., 2019). Antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the air, particularly pathogenic bacteria, may cause respiratory diseases of a longer duration due to their resistance to antibiotic treatment. There have been studies on ABR in food or other environments, such as soil, waste water, or hospital settings (Gao et al., 2018; Uhrbrand et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017). However, few studies have evaluated the changes in the percentage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in polluted and non-polluted air.",

Nutrient agar (NA) formula (OXOID, England) were added to distilled water and mixed well according to manufacturer's instructions. After sterilized by autoclaving, culture medium was distributed into plastic culture plates. After solidification, the culture plates were directly placed on all six stages of the sampler to collect air samples.

This could be attributed to the environmental conditions, sampling time, and bacteria's capability of adhering to PM in the ambient air. Air sampling using different sampler could bring various difference to bacterial concentration. The limitation of using Andersen Samplers is that it could damage cells during sampling process which may cause missing of a fraction of culturable bacteria. Still, it is a convenient and efficient method for air sample collection. Bacteria concentrations in indoor air were lower than in outdoor air under both weather conditions. Similar findings have been reported (Shelton et al., 2002; Emerson et al., 2017). In addition, results suggested that in polluted weather, most bacteria collected outdoor and indoor are likely to influence the secondary bronchi and terminal bronchi, respectively, indicating that people who remain inside during polluted weather may still be at risk of bacterial infection, particularly of the lower respiratory tract. Therefore, residents should better use health protective equipment (e.g., an air purifier) if they stay at home in polluted weather. It has previously been demonstrated that microbes can become attached to ambient particles and have significant effects on climate change (Brodie et al., 2007), increasing the risk to human health. Biological agents in both indoor and outdoor environments have been associated with reduced health, including allergies, asthma, infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, and even cancer (Douwes et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2018; Yoo et al., 2017), which may have high socio-economic impacts (Ghosh et al., 2015).",

After several generations, those bacteria may become too weak to grow continually. In this case, a total of 56.2% bacterial isolates (53.4% from the polluted weather samples and 78.1% from the non-polluted weather samples) were found to be culturable airborne bacteria. GPB were dominant under both weather conditions, which was in agreement with other studies (Brandl et al., 2014; Fang et al., 2006; G\u00f3rny and Dutkiewicz, 2002; G\u00f3rny et al., 1999; Liang et al., 2013). However, in both the indoor and outdoor samples, GNB had a higher relative abundance in polluted weather than in non-polluted weather, which indicated a potential correlation between pollutants and GNB. Actinobacteria were most abundant at the phylum level, and multiple genera within Actinobacteria were soil inhabitants (e.g., Streptomyces) (Ventura et al., 2007), indicating that soil inhabitants may be one of the key components of the airborne bacterial community, which was also found by Cao et al. during a severe smog event (Cao et al., 2014). Bacteria has correlation with the ground disturbance caused by human activities, which can stir up the dust and small soil particles from the ground. The relationship between air pollutants and GNB need further research to explore.",

MDR was defined as acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in \u22653 antimicrobial categories (Magiorakos et al., 2012). And \u226510 categories of antibiotics and their combinations were used to detect MDR bacteria in this study. A total of 23.7% of all tested culturable bacteria were MDR, which raises the question as to whether these bacteria could serve as reservoirs of resistant genes in the air and could pass on this resistance to more bacteria, including pathogenic species. MDR bacteria occupied 70% in GNB, compared to 17% in GPB. It is worth noticing that compare to GNB, GPB dominant much more in ambient air, which we believe may influence this difference of MDR occupation percentage to a certain extent. Still, the situation of MDR bacteria occupation in the ambient air was serious, approaching the percentage of airborne MDR bacteria that have been isolated from swine feeding operations (Chapin et al., 2005) or wastewater treatment plants (Teixeira et al., 2016). MDR bacteria occupied approximately one forth in both polluted or non-polluted weather, which also suggest the serious situation of airborne MDR bacteria. And interestingly, the distribution of MDR bacteria is not dependent on the weather conditions.",

Airborne AMR bacteria could be causing health problems by contributing to the conservation or expansion of the antibiotic resistance and resistant gene pool in the environment, thereby increasing the risk of resistance transfer to pathogenic microorganisms. It has been proven that resistance genes are capable of moving from animals to the environment and from the environment to the clinic (Cabello, 2006; Forsberg et al., 2012), with the latter representing a great threat to human health. Furthermore, transmission from the clinic to the environment can also occur, causing resistance to arise in environmental microorganisms, which may cause them to emerge as pathogens that continue to transfer resistance genes to other microorganisms. The antibiotic/antibiotic resistance phenomenon and ARGs have been present in the environment since long before their discovery by humans, because microorganisms produce antibiotics to defend themselves against competing organisms. It is widely known that resistant bacteria can be selected when high concentrations of antibiotic drugs are used therapeutically, particularly when these are misused or abused. Subtherapeutic application of antibiotics can also promote the development of antibiotic resistance (Lu et al., 2005). However, it has also been shown that even very low concentrations of antibiotics are sufficient to provide a selective advantage for resistant microorganisms (Gullberg et al., 2011). Furthermore, the presence of heavy metals and biocides could co-select antibiotic resistance in the environment. Resistance genes from this increasing environmental reservoir can then be transferred to pathogenic bacteria (Allen et al., 2010). While the results of this study are essential for public health, regretfully, it cannot be confirmed whether this bacterial resistance originated from the clinic or the environment. Therefore, further research is required to expand our understanding of MDR in the air around China and the world.",

(3) Approximately one-fourth of bacteria in the ambient air were MDR, regardless of the weather conditions, which may serve as a potential pathway for antibiotic resistance transfer between bacteria. (4) Penicillins was resisted by over 70% of bacterial isolates from the ambient air. These findings emphasized the importance of studying the antibiotic resistance of bacteria in the air. Future studies may focus on the pathway of AMR (and MDR) in the human respiratory tract by obtaining a larger number of air samples more frequently and by designing cross-sectional or case-control studies to determine whether the isolation and virulence of pathogens from the air are associated with human or clinical diseases.",
