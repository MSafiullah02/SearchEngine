This restriction can be the result of helpful personalized algorithms, that suggest user connections or rank highly information relevant to the users\u2019 profile. Yet, this isolation might inhibit the growth of informed and responsible humans/citizens/consumers, and can also be the result of malicious algorithms that promote and resurrect social, religious, ethnic, and other kinds of discriminations and stereotypes.",

Since there is no objective definition of what bias and biased concepts are [27], we let users define them. For these concepts, the model computes the support and the bias score of a web domain, by considering the support of this domain for each aspect (i.e., dimension) of the biased concept. These support scores are calculated by graph-based algorithms that exploit the structure of the web graph and a set of user-defined seeds representing each aspect of bias. As a running example we will use the biased concept of greek politics, that consists of nine aspects of bias, each one representing a popular greek party, and identified by a single seed; the domain of its homepage.",

This behaviour leads to rating bubbles when positive social influence accumulates [24] and minimizes the exposure to different opinions [31]. This is also evident in WSEs, where the personalization and filtering algorithms lead to echo chambers and filter bubbles that reinforce bias [4, 12]. Remarkably, users of search engines trust more the top-ranked search results [25] and biased search algorithms can shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by as much as 20% [8].",

In each iteration there is a history independent and non-symmetric probability of activating the neighbors of the activated nodes associated with each edge, flowing the support to the neighbors of the activated nodes in the . This probability is represented by the weights of the links of an activated node to its neighbors, and each node, once activated, can then activate its neighbors. The nodes and their neighbors are selected in arbitrary order. Each experiment stops when there are no new activated nodes. After n runs we compute the average support score of nodes, i.e., .

The biased surfer always starts from the biased domains (i.e., the seeds of an AB), and either visits a domain linked by the selected seeds or one of the biased domains again, with some probability that depends on the modeled behaviour. The same process is followed in the next iterations. The Biased-PR differs to the original PageRank in two ways. The first one is how the score (support in our case) of the seeds is computed at any step. The support of all domains is initially 0, except from the support of the seeds that have the value \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathtt{init_{seeds} = 1}$$\\end{document}. At any step, the support of each seed is the original PageRank value, increased by a number that depends on the behaviour of the biased surfer. We have considered three behaviours: (a) the Strongly Supportive (SS) one, where the support is increased by \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathtt{init_{seeds}}$$\\end{document} and models a constantly strongly biased surfer, (b) the Decreasingly Supportive (DS) one, where the support is increased by \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathtt{init_{seeds} / iter}$$\\end{document}, modeling a surfer that becomes less biased the more pages he/she visits, and (c) the Non-Supportive (NS) one, with no increment, modeling a surfer that is biased only on the initial visiting pages, and afterwards the support score is computed as in the original PageRank. Biased-PR differs also on how the biased surfer is teleported to another domain when he/she reaches a sink (i.e., a domain that has no outgoing links). The surfer randomly teleports with the same probability to a domain in any distance from the seeds. If a path from a node to any of the seeds does not exist, the distance of the node is the maximum distance of a connected node increased by one. Since the number of nodes at a certain distance from the seeds increase as we move away from the seeds, the teleporting probability for a node is greater the closer the node is to the seeds. We expect slower convergence for Biased-PR than the original PageRank, due to the initial zero scores of non-seed nodes. The algorithm is given in Algorithm 3.\n",

The huge scale of the web graph has the biggest performance implication to the the graph-based computation of the ABs support. What is encouraging though, is that the algorithms are applied over the compact SFG graph, that contains the SLDs of the pages and their corresponding links. The complexity of IC is in , where n is the number of experiments. LT is much slower though since we have to additionally consider the joint support of the neighbors of a node. Finally, the Biased-PR converges slower than the original PageRank, since the algorithm begins only with the seeds, spreading the support to the rest nodes. Also, we must consider the added cost of computing the shortest paths of the nodes from the seeds. For the relatively small SFG used in our study (see Sect. 6), the SS converges much faster than the DS and NS, which need ten times more iterations.",

Users can submit ABs and BCs into the bias goggles system and get notified when they are ready for use. However, what is important is to let users explore in real-time the domains space for any precomputed and commonly used BCs. This can be easily supported by providing efficient ways to store and retrieve the signatures of already known BCs, along with the computed support scores of domains of available ABs. Inverted files and trie-based data structures (e.g., the space efficient burst-tries [15] and the cache-consious hybrid or pure HAT-tries [2]) over the SLDs and the signatures of the ABs and BCs, can allow the fast retrieval of offsets in files where the support scores and the related metadata are stored. Given the above, the computation of the bias score and the support of a BC for a domain is lightning fast. We have implemented a prototype7 that allows the exploration of predefined BCs over a set of mainly greek domains. The prototype offers a REST API for retrieving the bias scores of the domains, and exploits the open-source project crawler4j8. We plan to improve the prototype, by allowing users to search and ingest BCs, ABs and domains of interest, and develop a user-friendly browser plugin on top of it.",

The higher the value, the more easily we can discriminate the golden domains from the rest. On the other hand, the AGS is the average similarity of the golden domains to their corresponding ABs. The higher the similarity value, the more biased the golden domains are found to be by our algorithms towards their aspects. A high similarity score though, does not imply high support for the golden domains or high disimilarity for the rest. The perfect algorithm will have high values for all metrics.

Regarding the Biased-PR  only the SS variation offers exceptional performance, especially for AGS. The DS and NS variations are more expensive and have the worst results regarding AGBR, especially the NSS that avoids bias. In most cases, algorithms benefit from more iterations. The SS variation of Biased-PR needs only 40 iterations for BC1 and 31 for BC2 to converge, proving that less nodes are affected by the seeds in BC2.
