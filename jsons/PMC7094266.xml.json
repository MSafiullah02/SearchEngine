Clinical signs include hypersecretion of cervical apocrine glands and mucoid diarrhoea, which causes severe dehydration that can rapidly proceed to death. Large outbreaks of sticky kit syndrome at mink farms are not uncommon, causing death in up to 30\u201340% of affected kits (Englund et al., 2002). During one such outbreak, post-mortem examinations conducted at the Michigan State University Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health (DCPAH), in Lansing, MI, revealed that the intestinal mucosa of affected kits was colonized by gram-positive coccoid bacteria. Bacterial culture and typing indicated that they were a strain of Staphylococcus delphini that was capable of producing enterotoxins A and E (Sledge et al., 2010).",

On gross examination, the coats of kits 1, 2 and 4 appeared normal except for mild faecal staining in the perineal region, while kit 3 had a rough and greasy hair coat. The stomachs of all kits contained milk. The small and large intestines of kits 1, 2 and 4 contained moderate amounts of yellow\u2013orange, mucoid to liquid faecal material (Fig. 1\n). The jejunal and ileal contents of the third kit were yellow\u2013white and mucoid, while the colonic contents were bright green and of mucoid to liquid consistency. Brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, pancreas and small and large intestine were collected from the four kits and were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 24 h. Representative sections were processed routinely and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (5 \u03bcm) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Selected sections of the small intestine were stained by the Gram's method (Hucker-Twort stain). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for coronavirus as previously described (Garner et al., 2008).",

The small intestine was negative by IHC for ferret enteric coronavirus in all the kits. For bacterial culture, representative sections of fresh frozen small intestine were pooled based on the age of the affected kits. For each pooled sample, intestinal contents were cultured as described by Sledge et al. (2010). Similarly, pooled samples of faeces were collected for parasitological evaluation and sections of small intestine were tested for the presence of ferret enteric coronavirus and group C rotavirus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (Wise et al., 2006, Wise et al., 2009). Small intestinal samples were negative by PCR for ferret enteric coronavirus and group C rotavirus and by qualitative faecal examination for intestinal parasites in all the kits.",

Phylogenetic analysis using the nucleic acid sequence of the three selected genes identified the bacteria as S. delphini (Fig. 4\n). The amplified nucleic acid sequences of the 16S rDNA and Hsp60 genes were identical among the bacterial isolates obtained in the current study and the S. delphini isolated previously from mink with sticky kit syndrome (unpublished sequence) (Sledge et al., 2010). Further, the 1,052 base pair sequence derived from 16S rDNA in the current study was 100% identical to multiple corresponding sequences from S. delphini in the GenBank database and the 485 base pair sequence of the Hsp60 gene had 95\u201399% similarity with corresponding sequences for S. delphini in GenBank.

The clarified bacterial culture supernatants were positive for enterotoxin(s) by ELISA. The presence of staphylococcal enterotoxin genes A to E was assessed by PCR assays, using PCR primers designed to amplify fragments of the Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin genes (sea, seb, sec, sed and see) (Fischer et al., 2009).

Minimal degeneration of intestinal epithelium with rare associated neutrophils, likely representing a mild reaction to bacterial toxins, was present in one ferret kit. In previous reports, bacterial colonization of the intestine by S. delphini with associated diarrhoea and excessive cervical apocrine gland secretion was described in mink kits ranging from 10 to 14 days of age (Sledge et al., 2010). The four ferret kits described in this report showed similar clinical signs to those \u2018sticky\u2019 mink kits: the ferret kits had pasty, yellow diarrhoea and one kit had also a sticky coat. However, ferret kits were affected at a wider age range (1\u20134 weeks) than mink kits. Many of the features of the diarrhoeal disease described in these ferret kits, including the intestinal colonization by gram-positive cocci, the isolation of S. delphini and the partial nucleic acid sequences of three genes of the isolates, are consistent with the findings previously described in the mink kits with sticky kit syndrome (Sledge et al., 2010).
