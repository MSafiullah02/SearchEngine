To date, little is known about the coping strategies adopted by emergency nurses in addressing uncertainty and changes during an epidemic event. The present study explored emergency nurses' behaviours and strategies in handling uncertainty and practice changes during an epidemic event. A qualitative study based on the Straussian grounded theory approach was established. Semi-structured, face-to-face, individual interviews were conducted with 26 emergency nurses for data collection. Adapting protocol to the evolving context of practice was revealed as the core category. Four interplaying subcategories were identified: (1) Completing a comprehensive assessment, (2) continuing education for emerging infectious disease management, (3) incorporating guideline updates and (4) navigating new duties and competencies. The nurses demonstrated the prudence to orientate themselves to an ambiguous work situation and displayed the ability to adapt and embrace changes in their practice and duties. These findings offer insights into the need for education and training schemes that allow emergency nurses to acquire and develop the necessary decision-making and problem-solving skills to handle a public health emergency.",

One major challenge faced by emergency nurses amid an EID outbreak is the elevated but unpredictable risk of infection. For example, the infectious status of most of the attendees in the AED is unknown. This uncertainty increases the risk of exposure to frontline emergency nurses compared with that of other healthcare professionals during an epidemic event [7] . In addition to the occupational risks associated with EIDs, a well-reported challenge encountered by emergency nurses is adapting to the changes in the existing guidelines and recommendations for addressing a particular EID [8] [9] [10] . Studies have highlighted that emergency nurses are required to frequently and rapidly adjust their practice in accordance with amendments to infection control guidelines, even if such amendments are subtle and/or implicit [8, 9] . The literature suggests that the antecedents of these challenges could be consequential to the uncertainty and changes experienced by emergency nurses in the workplace during an outbreak: changes and uncertainty within the work environment thus seem to be major and primary barriers to the emergency nursing practice [10] .",

A qualitative study was designed to explore the perceptions and experiences of emergency nurses during epidemic events. The grounded theory approach [13] was selected to facilitate the interactive process of data collection and analysis. Grounded theory attempts to understand the involvement of individuals through the exploration and interpretation of their perspectives and meaning within a social phenomenon [14] . This approach prioritises the interpretation of interactions among individuals within the embedded realities of a phenomenon, which offers insight into the elements that shape their beliefs and actions [15] . In addition, this study adopted the Straussian framework of grounded theory data collection and analysis that was developed by Anselm Strauss and Juliet Corbin [13] . The Straussian framework offers explicit and well-defined analytical steps for data analysis with the provision of a coding paradigm. This paradigm facilitates the discovery of associations among conditions, interactions and consequences [13] . The detailed framework of data interpretation supports the procedural operations of the data analysis process, which might help to establish the plausibility and completeness of the findings while preserving the intertwined and dynamic nature of the data [16] . This study thus used the Straussian framework to help gain an in-depth comprehension of the strategies adopted by emergency nurses to address uncertainty and changes in EID management.",

A purposive sampling strategy was used initially to recruit the first 10 participants. This strategy allowed for participants to be selected from the relevant population according to an initial set of criteria [17] . For inclusion, the participants had to be a full-time registered nurse in an emergency department in Hong Kong, Cantonese, English-speaking and willing to participate in the study and share their experiences. After initial recruitment, additional participants were solicited using a theoretical sampling strategy. This sampling strategy uses a systematic and cumulative participant recruitment method and is considered to be the major impetus to the progression of data collection and analysis in grounded theory studies [13] . Theoretical sampling is an iterative process wherein the participant recruitment and data collection processes are driven and performed according to the concepts alluded by the previous data [17] . It enables the ongoing development and elaboration of preliminary concepts and categories that emerge in the data analysis process and thus grants greater representativeness to the findings [18, 19] . In general, participant recruitment by theoretical sampling is continued until theoretical saturation is achieved, i.e., when no additional relevant information emerges from the data analysis and the concepts and categories are amply unfolded to display patterns of properties and dimensions [20] . In the present study, the repetition of concepts and categories continued after data had been collected from and analysed for 26 participants, when no additional concepts or categories were yielded. The participant demographic information is summarised in Table 1 . ",

According to the findings, the uncertainties surrounding the workplace environment amid epidemic-created obstacles for emergency nurses, preventing them from performing and adopting the skills and tactics required to handle EID management tasks in a fully prepared manner. To address this problem, emergency nurses attempt to obtain information regarding an encountered situation, which involves information about the disease and specific guidelines in response. Acquiring precise information during an EID event is essential for nurses as it provides them with the relevant facts, such as disease identification, management and prevention. In addition, effective information provision could strengthen nurses' capacity to offer health promotion and health education in the community, which could help calm public fears about EIDs [21] . Despite the importance of the swift provision of epidemic information, the emergency nurses included in this study noted that the disease information they receive might be temporary or incorrect, and such erroneous information can lead to confusion and conflict in practice. In fact, similar problems regarding issuing unreliable information during epidemics have been reported in previous studies [22, 23] . These findings indicate the need for healthcare facility administration and management to review and revise the effectiveness of current information dissemination strategies and systems. The findings of this study suggest that healthcare administrators should not merely disseminate information among nurses across services but should also appropriately streamline information to facilitate its integration into routine practice.",

Although this strategy is seemingly useful to nurses for obtaining first-hand information on an EID event, it may result in inaccurate estimations of the disease situation and adversely affect their awareness of the situation [24] . For instance, Sridhar et al. [25] reported that healthcare workers might underestimate the likelihood of Ebola infection because its incidence and seriousness are comparatively lower based on their practice experience than those quoted in the existing data. Consequently, this underestimation might undermine their awareness of the disease. The findings of the present study underpin the importance of maintaining effective communication between healthcare facilities and frontline healthcare workers, particularly emergency nurses, in improving the estimation of the magnitude of an EID situation.",

Such changes include changes in the disease situation, in the information provided and in emergency nursing practice. As frequently reported in the literature, changes in the workplace typically create tension for an organisation's stakeholders, including those who decide to initiate the changes and those who are required to implement the changes [26] . Changes in the general clinical context of EID management can have a considerable impact on the usual practice, expectations and work practices of the nurses. For instance, a change of the disease situation might induce structural changes in the workplace, which, in turn, might require nurses to change a well-adapted and accepted behaviour or working style to a new and unfamiliar practice. These changes might induce insecurity and create further uncertainty among nurses [27] . Other workplace changes might pose challenges to nurses' practice. For example, an increase in workload might increase the likelihood of mistakes being made during practice [28] . This issue may partially explain the reluctance of some of the participants included in the present study to accept changes made in different aspects of emergency care provision during EID management.",

This finding is in line with those of previous studies, showing that changes made within healthcare facilities might not always be in line with the ability of healthcare workers to adjust [29, 30] . Discrepancies may exist between the expectations of hospital administration on the renewal of existing practices and the actual preparedness and capacity of the staff to adopt the new practices [8] .

These altered duties and new tasks are often considered by emergency nurses to be far beyond their originally perceived scope of practice. For instance, nurses might be required to shoulder the responsibility of public health surveillance during an EID event, including case ascertainment and contact tracing, which could be perceived by emergency nurses as an extra duty outside of their usual domain of practice. To strengthen the capability of emergency nurses in subsequent epidemics, education and training should be provided to equip them with the relevant skills, knowledge and attitudes required to effectively perform their duties in the unprecedented circumstances of an EID outbreak. The training and education that is provided in hospitals to prepare emergency nurses for EID management is often focused on instilling the technical knowledge and skills required to implement infection control measures, such as hand hygiene practices or PPE use [32] . The provision of training and practice in the acquisition and augmentation of decision-making and problem-solving abilities may be overlooked. Thus, in addition to technical skills, we propose that education and training should place equal emphasis on developing nurses' cognitive skills, such as critical thinking. Such training will help equip nurses with the core skills required to process and apply knowledge in chaotic and complicated conditions.",
