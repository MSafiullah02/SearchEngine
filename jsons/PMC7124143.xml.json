As an example, Ruparelia et al. have reported on the synthesis of CuNPs involving the well-known wet-chemical reaction between sodium borohydride and copper nitrate, used as precursor. The resulting nanoparticles were dried in a reducing environment and stored in air-tight containers until biological testing. The presence of nanoparticles in suspension would ensure a continuous release of ions into the nutrient media [17]. Many redox processes can be used similarly. Among these, we outline the possible use of vitamin C [18], citrate [19], glucose [20] or similar nutrients/food additives to reductively produce CuNP colloids. At present, these nanomaterials have not been tested specifically as nano-antimicrobials, although such an application could have unprecedented advantages from the use of non-toxic reductants in the colloidal formulation.",

CuNPs were synthesized in phenyl ether using Cu(acac)2 as a salt precursor, oleyamine as a surfactant, and 1,2- tetradecanediol as a reducing agent. The solution was degassed and stirred while its temperature was raised at a rate of \u223c2\u00b0C/min to 155\u00b0C and was held there for an additional 1 h. During heating, the color of the reaction mixture changed from blue to dark red, signifying the formation of CuNPs. Cu nanorods were obtained by the same route as CuNPs, except that 0.1 equivalent of dodecylammonium bromide was added as structure-directing surfactant. The Cu nanostructures prepared by this route could be further functionalized by exchanging weakly bound surfactants to tighter binding alkane-thiols. This functionalization allowed for the control of surface chemistry and solubility of CuNPs and CuNRs in different solvents, and yielded nanostructures that were stable in solution for prolonged periods of time. Noticeably, copper nanoparticles functionalized with positively charged thiols were stable in water for several months. Cu-containing particles could be precipitated from phenyl ether with ethanol and re-dispersed in toluene or hexane for further use [21].\n\n",

Since it is known that CuNPs may aggregate quickly in colloidal media, the extent of agglomeration can be effectively reduced by lowering the surface energy by adsorption of stabilizers such as polymers or surfactants present in the medium. The incorporation of smaller inorganic particles into larger polymers is also desirable in order to combine the key properties of both the materials. A few years ago, the group of C. Neckers reported on the synthesis of functionalized CuNPs/polymer composites. The preparation protocol was based on two steps: at first, functionalized CuNPs were obtained by a modification of the Brust\u2019s procedure, introducing a polymerizable acrylic functionality into the NPs shell. Then, CuNPs were integrated into the polymer backbone by means of a specific cross-linking process, providing a way to control on the ionic release from the particles [22].",

As a result, 14-nm copper nanospheres were selectively immobilized at the bentonite nano-platelet surface. Key feature of this technology is the in situ formation of bentonite-supported metal nanoparticles which are assembled at the surface of the cationic polymer latex. As a consequence, a fragile inorganic shell is obtained, which is ruptured during melt processing, producing very uniform fine dispersions of bentonite/metal hybrid nanoparticles. This approach was demonstrated for PMMA but offers several new preparation routes for other acrylic and styrene monomers [24].",

Moreover, the biopolymer oxygen-rich functionalities and their affinity towards metals make them ideal candidates for the stabilization of nanoparticles [26, 27]. For example, agarose has been utilized to prepare bioactive composite films containing metal/semiconductor nanoparticles by introducing a metal/semiconductor precursor solution followed by a reducing agent, such as hydrazine hydrate, during the agarose gelation process. In a typical synthesis, agarose powder was dissolved in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth kept at 80\u00b0C with constant stirring. CuSO4 was added to this system at two different concentrations (about 3 and 6 \u03bcg of Cu per millilitre of LB broth), followed by the addition of N2H4 hydrate solution. The immediate appearance of wine red color was observed, indicating the formation of CuNPs which became faint upon solidification, and then was masked by the components of LB broth. The nanoparticles were trapped in the LB agarose matrix, which was then employed to check the NPs antibacterial activity, without further modification [26].",

CuNPs were prepared using a small-scale electrolytic process, performed by using a three-electrode cell, equipped with a copper sheet as sacrificial electrode, a platinum sheet as cathode electrode, and Ag/AgNO3 0.1 M in acetonitrile as reference electrode. During such a process, when the applied potential is sufficiently high, the anode dissolves under the form of metal ions that are subsequently reduced at the cathode surface in the presence of proper surfactants, such as tetra-n-alkyl-ammonium salts, which stabilize the nanoparticle under the form of a core\u2013shell structure in which the copper core is surrounded by quaternary ammonium ions (Fig. 3.7) [42\u201346]. Core\u2013shell CuNPs were directly obtained as nanocolloidal dispersion in a solution of disinfecting quaternary ammonium species, and then they could be easily mixed to water-insoluble polymers which were ultrasonically dissolved in the electrolysis solution. Several dispersing polymers were tested, including polyvinyl-methyl-ketone (PVMK), polyvinyl-chloride (PVC), polyvinyldene-fluoride (PVDF),estel 1100, etc., as a function of the final application envisaged. The resulting CuNPs/polymer hybrid solutions \u2013 with different CuNPs loadings \u2013 were directly spin-coated onto proper substrates for further characterization or applications.\n",

Using supported materials in place of unsupported ones, affords a higher environmental compatibility for a wider range of applications, either as free-standing nanocomposites or as deposited thin nanostructured films. Lipophilic nanoparticles embedded into water-insoluble polymers cannot be released into the environmental media or when allowed in contact with aqueous solutions. Using different amounts of core\u2013shell particles or properly choosing the stabilizing shell was shown to provide a way to finely select the concentration levels of released Cu ions. In fact, the stabilized structure of the CuNPs allowed a gradual and controlled copper ions release, when the nanocoatings were exposed to aqueous solutions (Fig. 3.8). The release extent of bioactive ions was demonstrated to be easily tuneable by a proper selection of preparation parameters, such as, for instance, the metal loading in the film. Noteworthy, the latter is a key aspect in order to kill or inhibit the growth of harmful species, without affecting the health of human beings [42, 47].\n",

FACVD is a relatively simple atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique that is compatible with both small volume batch and high volume continuous coating processes. Use of this method with low hazard aqueous solutions of simple metal salts can yield metal oxide thin films, which represents a major advantage in terms of precursor cost and environmental impact compared to alternative CVD methods [58].",

Two controls were established: the culture without any polymers or biocides, and the polymer lacking any copper particles. The latter was important to probe the effects of the polymer matrix or the irradiated photo-initiator on cell growth. Cell growth of the green algae was correlated with absorbance measured at 24-h intervals at 680 nm. The cell growth of the diatoms was monitored daily by measuring in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence (\u03bbex = 436 nm; \u03bbem = 680 nm). The antimicrobial activity of the acrylated copper nanoparticles developed by Neckers\u2019 group matched well with conventionally used biocides [22].",

Biological activity is not compromised by the use of controlled releasing of Cu-nanomaterials; on the contrary, we have recently demonstrated that these materials may have a great value for the development of antibacterial paints and coatings for household materials, textiles, biomedical devices, hospital and food storage equipment, etc. [47]. Thus, metal-polymer nanocomposites can be a valid option for such purposes because of the highly dispersed nature of the metal releasing-clusters and a large nanoparticles\u2013polymer interface area that ensures high reactivity. Advanced antifungal coating materials, such as hyperbranched polyamine/Cu nanoparticles, low-polydispersion copper NPs and NRs, functionalized CuNPs and Cu-grafted carbon nanotubes, are very important innovations for a number of biotechnological applications [21, 22, 25].",
