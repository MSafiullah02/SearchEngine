            "text": "Renin has a long and fascinating history. What began with its discovery in 1898 by Tiegerstedt and Bergman, who named it a kidney hormone [1], was forgotten for 40 years. However, by 1971, renin was recognized as an essential enzyme of the kidney renin angiotensin (AGT) aldosterone system. Its biochemistry, components, their location, and its function had been established. So when Detlev Ganten [2] proposed that there was renin in the brain independent of kidney renin, it required high standards of proof. Each time a new, more precise tool has become available, the role of brain renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been revisited. Early data was based on radioimmunoassay and enzyme assays [2, 3]. About that time, angiotensin II (ANG II) had become very interesting, physiologically and behaviorally [4]. When ANG II is injected into the brain, it elicits a pressor response and, if water is available, a drinking response. The behavioral act of drinking obviously requires neural circuits in the brain. It was reasoned that the effects of ANG II in the brain were isolated from circulating RAS by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, circumventricular organs (CVOs) lack a BBB and the circulating RAS and the endogenous brain RAS appear to have a complex interface in the CVOs [5, 6].",

Felix and Phillips [7] showed that ANG II activated neurons in the brain and in the subformical organ (SFO), and a peptide antagonist of ANG II, saralasin, inhibited ANG II-induced activity in those neurons. This suggested that ANG II is a nonclassical neurotransmitter. Taking the concept a step further, it was reasoned that if ANG II, formed by brain renin, was involved in hypertension, then inhibiting brain RAS would lower blood pressure. Simply injecting saralasin alone into the brain of stroke prone hypertensive rats (spSHR) temporarily reduced high blood pressure [8]. This occurred even in the absence of kidney renin when the spSHR rats were bilaterally nephrectomized [8]. The finding was later confirmed by molecular inhibition of ANG II synthesis in the brain [9]. It meant that brain RAS plays a role in neurogenic hypertension.",

What was needed were actual measurements of the renin and ANG II proteins. This was the achieved with high-performance liquid chromatography [13, 14] and direct protein assay [15].

This proved that there were sites within the brain that had evolved to be activated by ANG II made in the brain. Minute injections of ANG II into key brain nuclei showed that ANG II could differentially produce pressor effects, elicit drinking, release vasopressin, inhibit the baroreflex, and increase sympathetic nervous system activity [20, 21]. The confirmation that there was a separate brain RAS, independent of the circulating RAS, gave rise to the more generalized concept of local or tissue angiotensins in most other tissues including heart, blood vessels, and, ironically, the kidney [21] Whitebread et al. [22] and Chiu et al. [23] reported that there were two subtypes of the ANG II receptor, AT1 and AT2. From this has sprung not only insight into genes involved in brain function but also the highly successful angiotensin receptor blockade class of antihypertensive drugs. The development of the transgenic mice [24] was relevant to brain RAS with transgenic mice overexpressing AGT by a metallothionein promoter [25]. Transgenic mice, overexpressing AGT in brain and liver, led to high blood pressure [26, 27]. But, what about renin? Renin exists in only one form in humans, Ren-1, but in two forms in mice, Ren-1 and Ren-2. After inserting a mouse Ren-2 gene into a transgenic rat [TGR(mREN-2)27], Mullins et al. [28] reported fulminant hypertension in transgenic rats, even though circulating ANG II levels were low. The homogenous offspring developed malignant hypertension and had high mortality. The heterozygous offspring had end organ damage in the heart and kidney with extreme hypertension. Hypertension disappeared when the brains of these mice was anesthetized. Curt Sigmund\u2019s group [29] developed transgenic mice that overexpressed human renin and human AGT. With either a glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter or a synapsin-1 promoter, to stimulate gene expression in neurons or glial cells, hypertension and increased drinking resulted.",

If the inserted gene or the deleted gene of the transgenic animal is not embryonically lethal, it may be compensated for by other genes duplicating its role. This may account for the surprisingly benign effects of AT2 knockout transgenic mouse [30, 31]. To overcome this possibility, we developed gene suppression methods in adult animals using in vivo RNA-based inhibition. Antisense inhibition of AGT mRNA or AT1R mRNA oligonucleotides delivered to the brain reduces hypertension in SHR [32]. Antisense inhibition of AT1R specifically diminishes AT1 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus and Organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis [33]. Functionally, AT1 antisense inhibited the effects of ANG II in the brain including the pressor response, vasopressin release, and drinking [34]. In the double transgenic mice developed by Sigmund and colleagues [35], to overexpress both human renin and human AGT so that they constantly have high ANG II levels, antisense to AT1R mRNA dramatically reduced the blood pressure.[Phillips et al., unpublished].",

Cre, a bacteriophage P1-derived DNA recombinase, serves to recombine precisely defined DNA sequences that have been \u201cfloxed\u201d by loxP sequences prior to embryonic development. Because Cre recombines the loxP sequences, the floxed segment is deleted and rendered nonfunctional. Sinnayah et al. [37] microinjected Cre with a promoter into selective targets, such as the SFO and supraoptic nucleus, delivered by adenovirus vectors or feline immunodeficiency virus. With this technique, the Sigmund group have demonstrated the presence of brain RAS and its physiological and blood pressure effects [38, 39].",

ANG IV is an endogenous agonist that has been identified in the brain in areas distinct from those where AT1 and AT2 are located and probably acts on an AT4 receptor. An action of brain RAS is implied in memory and learning by the finding that stimulation of AT4 receptors potentiates the release of acetylcholine from hippocampal brain slices [40]. ACE 2 generates ANG (1\u20139) from Ang I [41, 42]; ACE 2 is a human ACE homolog that differs greatly from ACE in substrate specificity and its activity is not modified by ACE inhibitors [41].

ANG (1\u20137) is formed from ANG II via the action of several tissue-specific endopeptidases or from ANG I via ACE 2. ANG (1\u20137) can be metabolized by ACE to ANG (1\u20135); it is a peptide with no known biological activity. ANG (1\u20137) produces its biological effects such as vasodilatation, diuresis, natriuresis, and antitrophic via the Mas receptor [46]. Mas receptor stimulation also induces to production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin. This new view of the RAS suggests that overexpression of ACE-2 and ANG (1\u20137) receptors are potential targets for therapies. Another new concept has been proposed by J. Paton that baroreflexes can be controlled by systemic ANG II through activation of AT1 receptors on endothelial cells in capillaries close to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). The AT1 stimulation releases NO, which passes across blood vessels into NTS neurons and triggers the reflexive decrease in heart rate [47, 48]. This points to a complex interface between the brain RAS and the systemic RAS in controlling vital cardiovascular functions.",

The dementia presents as primary indicator with memory loss following progressive cognitive impairment and personality changes [69]. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of AD [60]. The amyloid plaque (AP) hypothesis postulates that AP is generated by proteolytic activity of the \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase processing the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, although AP was observed in transgenic mice with mutations of APP and presenilin-1 (PS1) genes, the mice did not exhibit neurodegeneration or memory loss observed in AD patients. Supporting the presenilin hypothesis, it postulates the neurodegenerative and behavioral effects independent of AP. An increase in the ACE activity and alteration in others components of brain RAS has been demonstrated in AD [61\u201364]. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown in animals and humans suggesting reducing brain RAS activity is important. There are many effects of decreased ANG II activity including reduced blood pressure, less acetylcholine release, and increase of substance P\u2014a substrate of ACE which is reported to increase neprilysin activity, a recognized amyloid \u03b2 degrading enzyme [59].",

Some clinical trails (SYST-EUR, Systolic Hypertension in Europe; PROGRESS, Peridopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke) and randomized studies using antihypertensive treatments have been performed using different combinations of ACE inhibitors: AT1 receptor antagonists, \u03b2-blockers, and diuretics treatments [61\u201364]. AT1 receptor antagonists normalized the expression of cerebrovascular nitric oxide synthase, cerebrovascular compliance, and protected cerebrovascular flow [66]. Similarly, cerebral blood flow was increased by ANG (1\u20137) and reduced by a selective ANG (1\u20137) antagonist A-779 [67]. These data suggest that ANG (1\u20137) could have protective effects in ischemia. In general, the results of treatment show a reduction of BP, stroke, vascular dementia, and cognitive decline [64]. Zhou et al. [68] showed evidence of an active local RAS in brain microvessels influenced by circulating prorenin and ANG II with a predominant localization to the microvessel endothelium. Kagiyama et al. [69] induced stroke with middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats and found that local ANGII levels and AT2 receptor concentrations increased. They concluded that brain RAS and AT2 receptors increase apoptosis in cerebral ischemia.",

Maul et al. [75] showed that in AT1 knockout mice, ANG II affected alcohol consumption, but AT2 receptor and bradykinin receptors are not involved [75]. Furthermore, ethanol-induced inhibition of hippocampal LTP is mediated by AT1 receptors [76]. Recently, Sommer et al. [77], using rats treated with spirapril\u2014a blood-brain-penetrating inhibitor of ACE\u2014or transgenic rats [TGR(ASrAOGEN)680] with reduced central AGT expression, showed that increased ethanol consumption was associated with an upregulation of AGT transcript levels and a downregulation of local AT1 mRNA. Taken together, these data suggest that reducing brain RAS could be a strategy for treating alcoholism.",

            "text": "Brain RAS distribution of AT1 receptors follows the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. During stress, both the peripheral and the central ANG II systems are stimulated, with increases in AT1 receptors expression and ANG II levels. Different types of stress have been associated with peripheral sympathetic nerve stimulation, increased plasma renin activity, and higher circulating ANG II [83]. AT1R are increased in brain by isolation stress induced by short periods of isolation and to 24-h isolation stress. AT1 receptor blocker prevented this response and the ulcerations of the gastric mucosa produced by isolation stress [66]. Peng and Phillips [84, 85] demonstrated that in cold-induced hypertension, AGT and ANG II in the brain predominate and in different brain areas, AT1R are upregulated and AT2R downregulated. AT1 antisense treatment reduced the cold-stress-induced high blood pressure [84]. Experimental studies also showed that pretreatment with losartan provide protection from stress induced by immobility or forced swimming [86]. ANG II is an important stress hormone, and blockade of AT1 receptors might be considered for stress-induced disorders. To inhibit central AT1 receptors may be impractical, but the hypothesis of Paton suggests inhibition of AT1R in brain capillaries could be an alternative if NO is involved [47, 87].",
