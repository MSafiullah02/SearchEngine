            "text": "An outbreak of a severe respiratory illness occurred in Washington, DC, in 1965 and another in Pontiac, Michigan, in 1968. Despite extensive investigations following these outbreaks, no explanation or causative organism was found. In July 1976 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, an outbreak of a severe respiratory illness occurred at an American Legion convention. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an extensive epidemiologic and microbiologic investigation to determine the cause of the outbreak. Dr Ernest Campbell of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, was the first to recognize the relationship between the American Legion convention in 3 of his patients who attended the convention and who had a similar febrile respiratory infection. Six months after the onset of the outbreak, a gram-negative organism was isolated from autopsied lung tissue. Dr McDade, using culture media used for rickettsial organisms, isolated the gram-negative organism later called Legionella. The isolate was believed to be the causative agent of the respiratory infection because antibodies to Legionella were detected in infected survivors. Subsequently, CDC investigators realized the antecedent outbreaks of febrile illness in Philadelphia and in Pontiac were caused by the same organism. They later demonstrated increased Legionella titers in survivors' stored sera. The same organism was responsible for the pneumonias that occurred after the American Legionnaires' Convention in Philadelphia in 1976.",

Clustering of cases and outbreaks is useful in recognizing common epidemiologic and clinical features and is helpful in initiating investigative efforts to determine the cause of such outbreaks. Without the large number of cases in the Philadelphia 1976 outbreak, the eventual identification of Legionella pneumophila as the cause of legionnaires' disease would have taken longer. A key clinical finding in legionnaires' disease (ie, relative bradycardia) was noted in early descriptions. Subsequently, because the criteria for relative bradycardia was not defined, the clinical importance of relative bradycardia has been overlooked and underestimated (Fig. 1\n).1, 2\n",

Legionella may be extracellular or intracellular. In the lung, Legionella cells infect mononuclear cells (eg, alveolar macrophages). To demonstrate Legionella in respiratory secretions, monoclonal antibody staining is preferred to polyclonal antibody staining. With polyclonal antibodies, false positives (ie, cross-reactions with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bordetella pertussis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bacillus sp) may occur. Cross-reactions with a monoclonal antibody are infrequent but may occur with S aureus or Bacillus species. Colonies of Legionella appear on Legionella solid culture media after approximately 3 days but some Legionella species may require 2 weeks to develop visible colonies.

By appreciating the relative diagnostic importance of various signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests, clinicians can apply these principles using a weighted diagnostic point score system that permits a rapid presumptive clinical diagnosis.

Although virtually every radiological manifestation of legionnaires' disease has been described, certain findings argue strongly against the diagnosis of Legionella CAP (ie, rapid cavitation within 72 hours, hilar adenopathy, or massive or bloody pleural effusion). Cavitation or abscess formation is rare with legionnaires' disease. Most characteristic of legionnaires' disease radiographically are rapidly progressive asymmetrical patchy infiltrates on CXR.39, 40 The rapid asymmetric progression of CXR infiltrates even with appropriate anti-Legionella sp therapy is usual with legionnaires' disease. When Legionella presents as severe CAP, the CXR is important in limiting/eliminating other diagnostic possibilities. Severe CAP with no/minimal infiltrates and profound hypoxemia should suggest a viral cause (eg, influenza [human, avian, swine], hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS], severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], or cytomegalovirus [CMV]). The differential diagnosis of severe CAP with focal segmental/lobar infiltrates includes Streptococcus pneumoniae (in patients with impaired splenic function), legionnaires' disease and zoonotic atypical pathogens (eg, Q fever, tularemia, or adenovirus).35 Because rapid asymmetrical progression of infiltrates on CXR may occur despite appropriate anti-Legionella therapy, the unwary clinician may be misled into thinking that the CAP is not caused by legionnaires' disease.28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35\n",

The consolidation with S pneumoniae is usually not sharply demarcated in contrast to legionnaires' disease with sharp demarcation of consolidation.42\n",

Similarly, splenomegaly is not a clinical feature of legionnaires' disease.

Most nonspecific laboratory markers of legionnaires' disease may occur (eg, highly increased ESR, highly increased CRP levels, mildly increased serum transaminase levels, highly increased serum ferritin levels) with other causes of CAP. Otherwise unexplained hypophosphatemia is an important nonspecific laboratory marker for legionnaires' disease because it is not associated with any other CAP pathogen. Hypophosphatemia occurs commonly with legionnaires' disease. Hypophosphatemia, when present in legionnaires' disease, may occur at any time during the in-hospital clinical course (Table 6\n). Although hypophosphatemia of legionnaires' disease may be prolonged in duration, more frequently it may be transiently present early and easily missed. It is not uncommon for the hypophosphatemia in legionnaires' disease to resolve spontaneously within the first day or 2 of hospitalization (Fig. 3\n). Unless serum phosphorus levels are obtained on admission or in the first few days of hospital admission, hypophosphatemia may be missed. Because serum phosphorus levels are not always ordered on admission by physicians in patients with CAP, an important clue to legionnaires' disease in a patient with CAP is often missed or its clinical significance overlooked (see Fig. 3 and Table 6).35, 49, 56\n",

Increased cold agglutinin titers, excluding influenza (human, avian, swine), CMV, and adenovirus, are not associated with extrapulmonary clinical features. Being aware of the pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement with various pulmonary pathogens, clinicians should have no difficulty in evaluating the clinical significance of mild/moderately increased serum cold agglutinin titers. Highly increased cold agglutinin titers in a patient with CAP points to the diagnosis of M pneumoniae CAP. Mild to moderate increases of cold agglutinins may also be present in patients with Q fever CAP. In a patient with CAP, the higher the cold agglutinin titer is over 1:64, the more likely it is that the patient has M pneumoniae. CAP with highly increased cold agglutinin titers (ie, >1:256) is virtually diagnostic of M pneumoniae CAP.

In CAP patients with extrapulmonary findings and a negative history of zoonotic contact who present with relative bradycardia, hypophosphatemia, or increased serum ferritin levels, the likelihood of legionnaires' disease is high. Clinically, given these findings in a CAP patient, there is no alternative diagnosis that would be readily confused with legionnaires' disease (Tables 10 and 11\n).35, 65, 66, 67\n",

            "text": "Clinically, legionnaires' disease and M pneumoniae CAP are the commonest nonzoonotic atypical CAP pathogens. Atypical CAP pathogens may be clinically differentiated from typical CAP pathogens by the presence or absence of extrapulmonary clinical and laboratory findings. Similarly, among the atypical CAPs a presumptive clinical diagnosis based on the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement of each individual pathogen is relatively straightforward. The zoonotic atypical CAP pathogens may be eliminated from consideration with a negative recent zoonotic contact history. If the patient has CAP and extrapulmonary findings ie, has an atypical CAP with zoonotic atypical pathogens eliminated by history, the differential diagnosis is limited to the nonzoonotic atypical CAP pathogens. Mycoplasma and legionnaires' disease are often in the differential diagnosis of non-zoonotic atypical CAPs, not because they resemble each other but because the M pneumoniae CAP is so common. Clinically, in terms of pattern of organ involvement and nonspecific laboratory tests, legionnaires' disease and M pneumoniae CAP are easily differentiated. The key cardinal findings that serve to differentiate legionnaires' disease from M pneumoniae are relative bradycardia, mildly increased serum transaminase levels, early/transient hypophosphatemia, highly increased ferritin levels, and microscopic hematuria. Although all of these findings are not present in every patient with Legionella CAP, sufficient findings will be present to permit a presumptive clinical diagnosis, and prompt specific laboratory testing for Legionella. Mycoplasma pneumoniae CAP has none of these features. Because M pneumoniae CAP is not accompanied by a pulse-temperature deficit (eg, relative bradycardia, hypophosphatemia, highly increased ferritin levels, or renal involvement), the presence of several of these findings eliminates M pneumoniae CAP from further diagnostic consideration. Conversely, the hallmark laboratory abnormality present in approximately 75% of M pneumoniae patients is increased cold agglutinin titers. Although low titers of cold agglutinins may be associated with some viral infections and may be associated with a variety of medical disorders. Highly increased cold agglutinin titers should suggest the possibility of M pneumoniae in a patient with CAP. The only other pathogens that could be confused with M pneumoniae CAP are Q fever and adenovirus. Excluding other causes of highly increased cold agglutinins (eg, cold agglutinin disease) with CAP patients with highly increased cold agglutinin titers (ie, \u22651:64) should be considered as having M pneumoniae CAP until proven otherwise. The cold agglutinin titers with M pneumoniae may not be present on clinical presentation but may be elevated in the course of the infection. Although the diagnosis of M pneumoniae is likely in a patient with CAP and highly increased cold agglutinin titers, (ie, >1:64); elevated cold agglutinin titers occur in only 75% of patients. The diagnosis of M pneumoniae CAP is confirmed by demonstrating elevated M pneumoniae IgM titers acutely and increasing IgG titers during convalescence.33, 35, 50, 68, 69\n",

            "text": "Q fever is an uncommon cause zoonotic atypical CAP. CAP in patients with a recent history of close contact with a zoonotic vector is often overlooked or not appreciated. An initial history regarding zoonotic contact vectors is often not elicited in patients presenting with Q fever CAP. Although patients can recall contact with sheep, they often overlook the potential clinical significance of a neighbor with a parturient cat. Q fever may mimic legionnaires' disease in onset of clinical presentation. Although legionnaires' disease may have a subacute onset, legionnaires' disease onset is acute when presenting as severe CAP. Q fever CAP usually has a subacute onset, as with most cases of legionnaires' disease. Relative bradycardia may be present with Q fever, as with legionnaires' disease. Among the extrapulmonary manifestations that overlap with legionnaires' disease are headache and less commonly mental confusion. The cardinal clinical finding in Q fever CAP is the presence of splenomegaly. In a patient with CAP and splenomegaly, Q fever is the most likely diagnostic possibility; alternatively, psittacosis should be considered in those with a recent exposure to psitticine birds. Splenomegaly is not a feature of legionnaires' disease but may be easily overlooked or may not yet be detectable on physical examination. In patients with CAP, splenomegaly is usually detected as an incidental finding if the abdomen is included in the CXR or chest CT. Among the nonspecific laboratory tests, mild increases of the serum transaminase levels occur with Q fever, legionnaires' disease, and psittacosis. Increased serum ferritin levels may also occur with Q fever CAP, although they are less frequent and not as highly elevated as with legionnaires' disease. If ASM antibodies are present in a patient with atypical CAP, it points to the diagnosis of Q fever. In patients with an atypical CAP, otherwise unexplained thrombocytosis occurring during hospitalization is an important clue to Q fever CAP. Although thrombocytosis may occur with M pneumoniae CAP, it is more common, pronounced, and prolonged with Q fever CAP. Other nonspecific laboratory features (ie, increased serum transaminases) readily differentiate Q fever from M pneumoniae CAP. Although there are no pathognomonic radiologic features that clearly differentiate legionnaires' disease from Q fever, round opacities or infiltrates, if present, are most helpful. The presence of so-called ovoid or round infiltrates should suggest the presence of Q fever in a patient with atypical CAP. Round or nodular infiltrates are not usually present in legionnaires' disease but may be present with Legionella micdadei CAP.35, 53, 54, 55, 69\n",

Although there is no pathognomonic radiographic presentation of legionnaires' disease, the radiographic behavior of the infiltrates is characteristic. Rapidly asymmetrical progression of infiltrates is characteristic of legionnaires' disease on CXR, which is not usual with adenoviral CAP. Adenoviral CAP often presents with a focal segmental/lobar infiltrate mimicking legionnaires' disease, Q fever, psittacosis, or typical bacterial CAPs. Although adenoviral CAP is not accompanied by relative bradycardia, many of the nonspecific laboratory findings associated with legionnaires' disease may be present in patients with adenoviral CAP. Most commonly, adenoviral CAP may be accompanied by a mild increase of AST/ALT levels, most commonly mimicking legionnaires' disease and less commonly, Q fever or psittacosis. Increased CPK levels are also frequently present in adenoviral CAP and legionnaires' disease. The key nonspecific markers of legionnaires' disease (ie, increased serum ferritin levels, hypophosphatemia, microscopic hematuria) are not features of adenoviral CAP. Of course, adenoviral CAP does not respond to anti-Legionella antibiotic therapy. Mild increases of cold agglutinin titers may be present, which would argue against the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease. Diagnosis is confirmed or ruled out by acute/convalescent adenoviral titers.35, 70\n",

In the differential diagnosis of severe CAP, common diagnostic considerations include influenza (human, avian, swine), SARS, HPS, CMV, and adenovirus. In compromised hosts (eg, patients with impaired CMI), Pneumocystis (carinii) jiroveci may present as severe CAP. Similarly, in transplant patients, CMV CAP is an important diagnostic consideration. Excluding zoonotic pathogens, the severity of CAP depends primarily on host factors rather than to the inherent virulence of the pathogen. In a patient presenting with severe CAP with focal segmental/lobar infiltrates on CXR, the differential diagnosis is often between legionnaires' disease, S pneumoniae, and adenovirus. Patients with S pneumoniae CAP do not usually present as severe CAP unless there is impaired humoral immunity (HI) (ie, impaired splenic function).35 Adenovirus is the \u201cgreat imitator\u201d of bacterial CAP. Unlike other viral CAPs presenting as severe pneumonia, adenovirus on the CXR may have focal segmental/lobar infiltrates without bilateral symmetric diffuse patchy infiltrates as with other viral pathogens (eg, influenza [human, avian, swine], CMV, HPS, or SARS). Patients with legionnaires' disease presenting with severe CAP, like patients with adenovirus, may be accompanied by various degrees of hypoxemia. Legionnaires' disease should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe CAP. The likelihood of legionnaires' disease in patients presenting as severe CAP is enhanced with otherwise unexplained relative bradycardia, hypophosphatemia, increased AST/ALT levels, or highly increased ferritin levels.35, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78\n",

When doxycycline is used for any serious systemic infection (eg, legionnaires' disease), optimally it should be administered using a loading regimen (not a loading dose). Because doxycycline is highly lipid soluble and has a long half-life (t1/2 = 21\u201324 hours), it takes 4 to 5 days with IV/PO dosing to achieve steady state concentrations.

All quinolones are highly active in vitro and in vivo against all Legionella species. Although doxycycline is highly active against the common typical CAP pathogens (ie, S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis), the \u201crespiratory quinolones\u201d have even higher activity against these pathogens. Doxycycline is highly active against penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae and most strains of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S pneumoniae, but \u201crespiratory quinolones\u201d are preferred for MDR S pneumoniae. Like doxycycline, quinolones are effective against typical and atypical CAP pathogens (eg, Legionella sp). \u201cRespiratory quinolones,\u201d like macrolides and doxycycline, penetrate well into alveolar macrophages and concentrate intracellularly to supraserum concentrations. \u201cRespiratory quinolones\u201d provide optimal monotherapy for CAP caused by either typical or atypical pathogens. In patients who are quinolone intolerant doxycycline remains a highly effective agent for all Legionella species that cause legionnaires' disease. \u201cRespiratory quinolones\u201d have excellent bioavailability (ie, more than 90% absorption) and are ideal for PO or IV to PO switch therapy for CAP. Because of their excellent absorption, even in seriously ill patients, \u201crespiratory quinolones\u201d may be used to treat legionnaires' disease entirely by the oral route.35, 70, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97\n",
