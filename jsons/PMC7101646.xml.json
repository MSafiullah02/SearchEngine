All three of the cases were travelers who had recently returned from Ontario, Canada, via Detroit, USA. Following this initial report, the number of confirmed cases steadily rose. About a month later, on June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to phase 6, the highest level. For a period of several months, many articles on the influenza pandemic were published in different parts of the world. According to these reports, the symptoms, disease severity, and mortality of the pandemic influenza virus seem to have differed from nation to nation. Available findings highlight the importance of early use of antiviral drugs. In Japan, antiviral drugs for influenza, including both oseltamivir and zanamivir, are available at all medical institutions.",

In 2009, the city had an estimated population of 510,000. In total, 1,122 tests were performed after informed consent was obtained and 190 patients were examined more than twice during our investigation period. Out of the 1,122 cases tested, 608 (54.2%) were male. The age of the patients ranged from 10 months to 94 years (median 18, interquartile range 10\u201334). The clinical features were compared between the patients who tested positive and negative for the influenza A virus in the RIDT. After diagnosis, all of the patients were given warning leaflets with the emergency phone numbers of our institutions. The study conformed to the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the internal review boards of our institutions. Informed written consent was obtained from every subject.",

Among the 389 positive patients, 72.2% (281 patients) were younger than 18 years and only 3.1% were 51 years of age or older. In total, 229 (58.9%) of the positive patients were male, and the difference between the percentages of males and females was significant. The median time from the onset of symptoms to the positive result in the RIDT was 24 h (interquartile range 14.5\u201324). The maximum body temperature was significantly higher in the positive group (median 38.5\u00b0C, interquartile range 38\u201339) than in the negative group (P < 0.001) (Table 1). As shown in Table 2, symptoms of cough, headache, and rhinorrhea were present in 81.7, 51.4, and 48.8% of the patients in the positive group, respectively. The incidence of diarrhea was quite low. Incidence of muscle pain and arthralgia did not differ significantly between the two groups. Impaired consciousness was not observed in any of the patients in our series. A history of recent contact with persons suffering from influenza-like illness or influenza at home, school, or in the workplace was significantly more frequent in the positive group than in the negative group, (influenza-like illness 74.3 vs. 47.1%, P < 0.001; influenza 62.2 vs. 39.9%, P < 0.001). Pneumonia were recognized in only two patients from the positive group. One of these patients was admitted to a university hospital and definitively diagnosed with pandemic influenza by a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT\u2013PCR) assay. Oseltamivir was administered to 284 (73.6%) of the positive patients and zanamivir was administered to 98 (25.4%) of the positive patients. Four of the patients received neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir. Of the 389 positive patients, 94.9% visited one of our institutions within 48 h of symptom onset and received either oseltamivir or zanamivir immediately. No deaths were observed among the 389 RIDT-positive patients. In addition, more than 20% of the patients who tested negative in the RIDT also received antiviral drugs. Nausea and vomiting occurred in 3 patients, all of whom were taking oseltamivir. No severe adverse effects were reported. Multivariable logistic-regression analysis identified the following as independent risk factors for positive RIDT findings for the influenza A virus: age less than 30 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54\u20133.04), maximum body temperature of more than 38\u00b0C (OR 2.91, 95% CI 2.13\u20133.97), cough (OR 3.53, 95% CI 2.55\u20134.88), rhinorrhea (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.81), anorexia (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08\u20132.45), and history of contact with persons with influenza (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.05\u20132.47) (Table 3).\n\n\n",

Most of the affected patients have been young. During our investigation period, more than 70% of the RIDT-positive outpatients were under the age of 18 years, and only 3.1% were 51 years of age or older. Influenza morbidity was much more common in the young than in the old in our investigation. This was identical to the trend observed for the morbidity of seasonal influenza. One reason proposed for this young age distribution has been the higher risk of influenza exposure in school environments. Although seasonal influenza-associated hospitalization rates and mortality are higher among persons 65 years of age or older and young children than among healthy older children and younger adults [8, 9], none of the patients in our series, including the older adults, deteriorated to serious conditions. Chowell et al. [4] reported that low rates of morbidity and mortality from the pandemic influenza among the elderly reflect relatively stronger protection for persons who had been exposed to H1N1 strains during childhood, before the 1957 pandemic. There is reported evidence that exposure to a 1918-like H1N1 virus contributed to the induction of a cross-reactive antibody response to the pandemic influenza virus [10]. Similarly, both studies in England and in Japan have revealed that serum donors from older adults who had probably been exposed to the 1918 virus or a closely related H1N1 virus carried high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the 2009 H1N1 [11, 12].",

Therefore, differences in seasonal effects, the length of time from onset to treatment, and the severity of the illness might have affected the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances.",

[14] on 426 patients with pandemic influenza in China, 0 of 19 patients who presented with abnormalities on chest radiography developed severe pneumonia. This might have been partly the result of early diagnosis and early treatment with oseltamivir, because 18 of their 19 patients with pneumonia were given oseltamivir within 48 h from the onset of symptoms. From the report in Mexico [5], the time between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission ranged from 4 to 25 days (median 6). None of the 18 patients of Cao et al. received oseltamivir before admission. In our series, 94.9% of 389 positive patients visited our institutions within 48 h of the onset of symptoms and received either oseltamivir or zanamivir.",

Without this diagnostic confirmation, we were unable to determine whether there were any cases with influenza A subtypes other than pandemic influenza. However, the Japanese IDSC reports that the proportion of pandemic influenza to all influenza virus was 99% during our investigation period [3]. Only a very small number of positive patients were thought to suffer from seasonal influenza virus. Second, the sensitivity of the RIDTs is still poor [16\u201318]. According to the report and to guidance from the CDC, the specificity of RIDTs is generally high [16, 17]. When influenza viruses are circulating in a community, a positive test indicates that the specimen is likely to be infected with the influenza virus. On the other hand, the CDC guidance also reports that the sensitivity of RIDTs for detecting pandemic influenza A virus infections ranges from 10 to 70% compared with RT\u2013PCR. For this reason, false negatives may have led to underestimation of the true burden of the influenza A virus.",
