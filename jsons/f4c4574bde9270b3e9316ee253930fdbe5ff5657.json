The authors presented several plausible factors to explain these findings. The adequacy of initial antibiotic treatment was lower in the aggressivelytreated group, which therefore extended the antibiotics exposure. Moreover, the waiting time for blood cultures and observation of the clinical course may also disclose alternative diagnosis to infections. At last, up to 25% of patients initially diagnosed as septic shock did not have an identified infection 24 h after their initial diagnosis [11] .",

Presence of shock without an alternative diagnosis other than infection, and a diagnosis of infection based on cultures, bacterioscopic examinations, and imaging results for the initiation of antibiotics is currently considered safe practice. Furthermore, clinicians can consider investigating feasible alternative diagnosis for shock in unstable ICU patients before antibiotics initiation. Consideration of antibiotic use in our ICUs is essential, and if necessary; there is great plausibility in changing our mindset to restrict antibiotic use.",
