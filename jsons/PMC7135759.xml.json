The \u201cSpanish flu\u201d of 1918 to 1919 resulted in 20 to 40 million deaths worldwide.1 In the late 1990s, after several decades of fairly stable human influenza viruses, highly pathogenic avian influenza infected humans in Southeast Asia for the first time. In the setting of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and emerging human infections with these highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, the prospect of a pandemic looms large for public health authorities and should prompt preparative measures from emergency care providers.",

Neuraminidase facilitates release of progeny virions from host cells after replication and is the target of antiviral therapies. These proteins are also used to identify different strains; to date, 15 hemagglutinin (H1-15) and 9 neuraminidases (N1-9) have been identified. Only 3 hemagglutinin (H1-3) and 2 neuraminidase (N1, N2) subtypes of influenza A persist in humans. Certain hemagglutinin and neuraminidases subtypes are associated with pigs (H1, H3, N1, N2) and horses (H7, N7, N8). All hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes are established in aquatic birds.2, 3\n",

Local epidemics, like the severe \u201cflu season\u201d of 2003 to 2004 in the United States, are caused by antigenic drift. This means that random point mutations in the genetic sequence escape repair, leading to gradual \u201cdrift\u201d of the gene pool. The genes coding for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are inherently unstable and constantly undergoing genetic drift. People are more susceptible to these slightly altered strains but also retain some degree of crossimmunity from prior influenza exposures. Thus, resultant epidemics are limited in scope and severity.",

At the same time, H5N1 is resistant to the antiviral action of these excess cytokines.16 Also unique to influenza A strain H5N1 is its propensity to affect other organ systems, renal, hematologic, and gastrointestinal in particular.6\n",

These agents reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when initiated within 2 days of symptom onset.2 These antiviral medications have not been well studied for avian influenza but may play a role in preventing concomitant human and avian influenza infection. The current H5N1 avian strain is resistant to M2 protein inhibitors.4, 9, 11 Neuraminidase inhibitors, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were variably used in the recent H5N1 outbreaks. Given the relatively small number of patients and the completely uncontrolled manner in which the medications were used, however, no conclusions can be drawn regarding their efficacy. Influenza vaccination appears to be the most logical method of controlling the spread and prevent potential epidemics, but current vaccines provide no protection against avian H5 or H7 strains. Because H5 and H7 strains are highly lethal to chicken embryos, current vaccine production methods cannot produce avian vaccine efficiently. Newer vaccine production techniques, including the use of reverse genetics technology that can tailor rapidly to specific influenza strains, appear to be promising.17\n",
