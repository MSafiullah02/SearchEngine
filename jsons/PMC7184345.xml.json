Unfortunately, CQ did not show efficacy in inhibiting viral replication in a mouse SARS-CoV model [3]. Nevertheless, by considering its anti-inflammatory properties, it has been postulated that CQ/HCQ may have some effect on SARS [3, 4]\u2014in particular, by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin [IL] 6) and consequently blocking the subsequent cascade of events which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4].",

This paradoxical effect has been explained by a delay in immune adaptive response to the virus provoked by CQ administration that could nullify the antiviral activity shown in vitro [8].",
