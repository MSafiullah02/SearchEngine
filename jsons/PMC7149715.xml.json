Some parameters such as bile acids, cholesterol and urea follow a diurnal rhythm that also affects the total and differential white cell count (Fox and Laird, 1970; Fekete, 1989; Loeb and Quimby, 1989). Stress associated with car journeys or a period in unfamiliar surroundings will increase blood glucose and alter haematological parameters such as the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Pregnancy affects parameters such as protein, haematocrit, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides (Viard-Drouet et al., 1984), glucose, sodium, calcium, phosphate and red cell indices (Palm, 1997). Serum cholesterol is the parameter that is most affected and can be up to 30% lower in pregnant than in non-pregnant animals (Palm, 1997).",

Some reference ranges are an amalgamation of other references ranges and result in a range so wide that almost any result will fall within it. For example, the reference range for serum albumin concentrations of pet rabbits is given as 27-46 g/l (Malley, 1996) based on four published sets of data. Gillett (1994) gives an even wider range of 27-50 g/l for laboratory rabbits based on five sets of data. For some parameters there are big differences between published reference ranges. An example is blood calcium. Gillett (1994) gives a range of 1.5-3.4 mmol/l in comparison with 3.4-4.0 mmol/l by Harkness and Wagner (1995). Differences in calcium content of the diet between the groups of rabbits or differences in analytical technique could explain these discrepancies. Different laboratory methods can result in large differences between reference ranges. An example is alkaline phosphatase. Collins (1988) gives a reference range of 4.1-16.2 IU/l in comparison with 10-70 IU/l (Gillett, 1994) or 112-350 IU/l (Harkness and Wagner, 1995).",

The red blood cells vary in diameter within a range of 5.0-7.8 \u03bcm (Sanderson and Philips, 1981). This variation in diameter (anisocytosis) is a feature of blood smears from rabbits and is not a significant finding (see Plate 2). The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measurement of the variation in size of erythrocytes and is higher in rabbits (11-15, Idexx reference range) than in dogs and cats (8-10; Bush, 1981). In dogs and cats, anisocytosis is indicative of the presence of reticulocytes and a regenerative anaemia. In rabbits, 1-4% of circulating erythrocytes may be reticulotytes. Polychromasia and reticulocytes in rabbit blood smears have been attributed to the short life span and high turnover of erythrocytes (Kraus et al., 1984). Nucleated red cells and Howell-Jolly bodies can also be found occasionally (McLaughlin and Fish, 1994).",

Administration of exogenous adrenaline to rabbits results in redistribution of lymphocytes from spleen and bone marrow to peripheral blood, lungs and liver (Toft et al., 1992a). Conversely, exogenous corticosteroid administration results in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen to the lymphatic tissue in rabbits (Toft et al., 1992b). Prolonged periods of stress cause neutrophilia and lymphopaenia. Marked changes in white cell distribution with a relative neutrophilia and lymphopaenia were found in a study of the cortisol levels and haemograms of rabbits after transport, either by air or by lorry. The changes in white cell distribution lasted for 24-48 h and were correlated with increased cortisol levels (Toth and January, 1990).",

Diabetes mellitus has not been described in pet rabbits and there is some difference of opinion about its importance as a clinical disease (Hoefer, 2000; Jenkins, 2000; Rosenthal, 2000). Herbivorous animals withstand the absence of insulin more readily than carnivorous ones (Bentley, 1998) and are therefore not so susceptible to diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus has been induced in laboratory rabbits by the administration of alloxan. It has also been described as a hereditary disease in rabbits. A laboratory strain was selectively bred as an animal model of human diabetes mellitus. (Roth and Conaway, 1982). Affected animals were polydipsic, polyuric and polyphagic with severely impaired insulin release. Elevated glycosylated haemoglobin values of 12.2% were observed in the overtly diabetic animals in comparison with 3.9% in normal animals. Increased glycosylated haemoglobin levels did not correlate with plasma glucose concentrations (Cannon and Conaway, 1981). Histologically there was hypergranulation of \u03b2-cells of the islets of Langerhans. Obesity and ketoacidosis were not features of diabetes mellitus in the laboratory rabbits. The hyperglycaemia was in the region of 540-590 mg/dl (30-33.4 mmol/l) and there was marked glycosuria. Roth and Conaway (1982) described the maintenance of one diabetic individual on insulin at a dose of up to 8 units per day for 3 years. Ketonuria was not observed.",

In a study by Harcourt-Brown and Baker (2001), pet rabbits kept in free-range conditions had significantly higher serum albumin concentrations than rabbits that were suffering from advanced dental disease. They were also significantly higher than rabbits kept in hutches that were not suffering from dental problems (see Figure 6.1). The difference in albumin levels was attributed to differences in diet and husbandry. Caecotrophs are a source of amino acids for rabbits and normal caecotrophy is an important element of their protein metabolism. Low fibre diets, obesity, dental disease or skeletal abnormalities can prevent rabbits ingesting caecotrophs from the anus and reduce the available amino acids for protein synthesis. Rabbits that are kept in hutches are more likely to be eating a low fibre diet and to suffer from obesity and skeletal problems than rabbits living outside with unrestricted access to natural vegetation and exercise.",

Dietary protein concentrations and quality, withholding food and natural diurnal rhythms can all affect blood urea concentrations. Higher levels occur in the late evening (Loeb and Quimby, 1989). The rabbit's urea metabolism is further complicated by urea utilization by caecal microflora during catabolism or during periods of dietary excess. Therefore small fluctuations in serum urea concentrations are difficult to interpret. Laboratory reference ranges apply to animals that are fed a standard diet and have usually been bled at a specific time of day. Pet rabbits are subject to greater fluctuations in blood urea values due to the variation in diet and other factors, and can have values slightly higher than laboratory reference ranges. Prerenal azotaemia associated with poor renal perfusion occurs during periods of dehydration. The rabbit has a limited capacity to concentrate urea and a greater volume of urine is required when urea load increases (Brewer and Cruise, 1994). Increased blood urea values were recorded in a study by Licois et al. (1978) of young rabbits with diarrhoea experimentally induced with coccidiosis. The authors suggested that the blood urea values rose as a result of intense nitrogen catabolism during weight loss associated with the disease. Water deprivation can lead to high blood urea values as high as 40 mmol/l in association with creatinine values in excess of 200 \u03bcmol/l (Harcourt-Brown, unpublished data).

PTH assays have been performed on pet rabbits as part of an investigation of the possibility of metabolic bone disease as a cause of poor tooth and bone quality and the development of dental disease in rabbits (Harcourt-Brown and Baker, 2001). Sample handling is of paramount importance as the hormone is labile and haemolysis interferes with the assay. Samples require separating and freezing immediately after collection and must be shipped in the frozen state to a laboratory. Sufficient, non-haemolysed blood to harvest 1-2 ml of serum or plasma needs to be collected. As PTH is responsible for the minute to minute regulation of blood calcium, values can vary over a wide range making interpretation of a single result difficult. Diet, age, pregnancy, lactation, diurnal rhythms cause physiological variations in results. Warren et al.

Lesions were not seen in the brain until at least 8 weeks after the first detectable antibodies, suggesting that serology is a sensitive procedure for early diagnosis (Cox and Gallichio, 1978). Therefore animals with clinical signs that are seronegative are unlikely to be suffering from encephalitozoonosis, although experimental infections with Encephalitozoon cuniculi have shown the presence of granulomas in the brain of animals that had become seronegative (Kunstyr et al., 1986). Conversely, asymptomatic rabbits can be seropositive. Therefore serology can only be used as a guide in the diagnosis of Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection.

Urinary pH is approximately 8-8.2. Rabbit urine is normally turbid due to the presence of calcium carbonate that can be seen as sediment in collected samples. The urine from anorexic, pregnant, lactating or young rabbits is often clear. The colour of normal urine can vary from pale yellow, to orange, brown or red, mimicking haematuria. Plant porphyrin pigments are the cause of red coloured urine and can be distinguished from haematuria with urinanalysis dipstick tests. Alternatively, a Wood's lamp can be used, as urinary pigments fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light (Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999). In addition to the presence of calcium carbonate crystals, oxalate or ammonium magnesium phosphate crystals can also be found in normal rabbit urine. The specific gravity of rabbit urine is difficult to evaluate accurately due to the presence of mineral deposits (Goad et al., 1989) but is approximately 1.003-1.036. Traces of glucose and protein can be present in normal rabbit urine. As in other species, rabbit urine can be spun and the sediment examined microscopically for the presence of crystals, red cells, inflammatory cells and bacteria. Cultures can be taken to confirm bacterial infection and aid antibiotic selection. Examination of urine sediment stained with gram stain can reveal Encephalitozoon cuniculi spores that are oval, strongly gram-positive with a coiled filament inside (Pye and Cox, 1977; Patton, 2000). Ketones may be detected in the urine of anorexic rabbits and is a poor prognostic sign as it is associated with the development of hepatic lipidosis.",

The first step in faeces examination is to determine which type of faeces has been collected. It is often samples of soft faeces or caecotrophs that are collected for examination because their consistency is abnormally loose or the owner has mistaken uningested caecotrophs for diarrhoea. Microscopically the two types of faeces are completely different. Hard faeces contain indigestible fragments of plant debris and little else. Caecotrophic material contains a wide range of microorganisms including large gram-negative bacilli, Bacteroides, large metachromic staining bacilli and many other bacteria including oval and fusiform rods. In some types of diarrhoea, a mixture of indigestible fragments of plant material can be seen alongside a range of typical caecal microorganisms. This signifies a failure of the proximal colon to separate the indigestible and digestible fractions of the diet. Coccidial oocysts or eggs of the non-pathogenic oxyurid Passalurus ambiguus can be found in both hard and soft faeces of infected rabbits. Coccidial oocysts can be confused with a non-pathogenic Saccharomyces, a budding sporogenous yeast that can be present in large numbers in rabbit faeces (see Figure 6.2\n).",

As part of an investigation into the relationship of metabolic bone disease with dental disease, blood samples were taken from pet rabbits presented for veterinary treatment or for health checks. At the time of sampling the rabbits were assigned to one of four groups: ADD (advanced dental disease), EDD (early dental disease), H (healthy rabbits kept in hutches), FR (rabbits kept in free-range conditions in a large enclosure with unlimited access to exercise and natural daylight all year round). No rabbits in the free-range group (FR) showed signs of dental disease; all the rabbits in the ADD, EDD and H groups were kept in hutches. Blood results from rabbits that were found to be suffering from other conditions, such as renal disease or neoplasia, were not included in the statistical analysis. The ADD group consisted of rabbits that were presented for veterinary treatment for dental disorders such as acquired malocclusion or abscesses. All the other rabbits in the EDD, H and FR groups were presented for neutering, health checks, vaccination or euthanasia. Rabbits in the EDD group had signs of early dental disease, such as horizontal ribs on the incisors, swellings along the ventral border or the mandible or epiphora related to elongation of the roots of the upper primary incisors. The investigation was conducted to compare blood parameters related to calcium metabolism in rabbits with or without dental disease. The healthy free-range group was used as a control. During the course of the study, differences in haematological pictures and albumin values emerged among rabbits kept under the different husbandry regimens. Complete blood counts from free-range rabbits were comparable with laboratory reference ranges whereas there were significantly lower red cell and lymphocyte counts in rabbits suffering from advanced dental disease. The low lymphocyte counts of rabbits with dental disease suggest they suffered from chronic stress. Serum albumin values were significantly higher in rabbits kept in free-range conditions than in those suffering from advanced dental disease or those unaffected by dental disease but kept in hutches. Total serum calcium concentrations were highly correlated with serum albumin levels. Rabbits kept in hutches showed trends towards anaemia and lymphopaenia. Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were higher and total serum calcium concentrations were lower in hutch-kept rabbits with advanced dental disease in comparison with rabbits kept in free-range conditions. These results indicated that acquired dental disease of pet rabbits is related to husbandry and is associated with alterations in calcium metabolism.

(a)Coccidial oocysts and saccharomyces (\u00d7 100). Shows large numbers of coccidial oocysts interspersed with Saccharomyces guttulatus. The faecal sample was from a 14-week-old, thin rabbit that was suffering from diarrhoea. Faecal material was emulsified with water before being passed through a fine sieve to remove the coarse debris. The homogenate was then centrifuged and the supernatent discarded. The residue was mixed with saturated salt solution and centrifuged again. After the sample had been spun, more saturated salt solution was added to the test tube until a meniscus formed. A cover slip was placed over the meniscus and the sample left for approximately 30 minutes for the oocysts or worm eggs to float to the top of the tube. At the end of this period, the cover slip and surface film was removed from the test tube, placed on a microscope slide and examined under low power. (b)Eimeria steidae (high power) (Image kindly supplied by Dr Sheelagh Lloyd, Division of Animal Pathology, University of Cambridge). Several Eimeria spp. affect rabbits and mixed infections occur. The species can be differentiated by the morphological characteristics of the oocysts. The most pathogenic species is Eimeria steidae, which causes hepatic coccidiosis (see Section 16.4.1). E. steidae invades the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and can cause severe liver damage. Oocysts may be seen in faeces from infected rabbits or in smears of bile collected from rabbits during post mortem examination. The relative sizes of coccidial oocysts and Saccharomyces guttulatus can be seen in (a,b). Worm eggs are larger than coccidial oocysts. The most common helminth infestation of pet rabbits is Passalurus ambiguus. Adult worms or ova from P. ambiguus may be seen in rabbit faeces. The ova are ovoid, slightly flattened and asymmetrical with a cap at one end. (c)Saccharomyces guttulatus (high power) (Image kindly supplied by Idexx Laboratories, Wetherby).
