As a subhospital of West China Hospital, Wenjiang Hospital maintains the same level of care as the main hospital at all times. According to the actual situation and architectural characteristics of the hospital, prevention and control measures are rapidly deployed according to the local conditions to prepare for the outbreak before it arrives. According to the overall requirements of the hospital, under the organization and leadership of the director of the subdivision hospital, the NCP epidemic prevention and control working group of the branch was established. The head of the subdivision hospital serves as the group leader; the chief of the medical section, the infection control administrator, and the director of the outpatient department serve as the deputy group leaders; and the heads of the respiratory specialty, ICU, lung cancer center, laboratory, equipment department, logistics, security, radiation, color Doppler ultrasound, cleaning, and other related departments serve as team members. All members work together; closely monitor the development of the epidemic situation in the whole country, hospitals, and hospital areas; report the epidemic situation to relevant departments in an accurate and timely fashion; and organize regular meetings to discuss, formulate, and revise prevention and control plans and measures and are responsible for the full implementation of plans, resource organization, and coordination.",

Once outpatient clinics are opened, patients from all over the country will become vulnerable to nosocomial infection of NCP. In accordance with the technical guidelines for the prevention and control of NCP in medical institutions (first edition), suspected cases of fever must be isolated in place.\n2\n To minimize cross\u2010infection in the hospital caused by NCP. On January 17, 2020, the NCP epidemic prevention and control working group of Wenjiang District carefully studied the architectural features and space utilization of the district, formulated an emergency plan for the prevention and control of NCP in the affiliated district, and set up a preexamination and triage station and a tent observation area for patients with fever at the entrance of the hospital. The isolation observation room was rebuilt according to the relevant provisions of the \u201ctechnical code for hospital isolation.\u201d\n3\n The objective is to isolate patients with fever or suspected cases for early detection and minimize cross\u2010infection in the hospital. The NCP emergency plan regarding guidelines for prevention and control in subhospital areas will be regularly adjusted and improved according to the provisions and control requirements of the country and the hospital in different periods.",

Wenjiang Hospital in West China intends to strengthen the education and training of staff regarding knowledge, information and regulations related to epidemic prevention and control through WeChat, QQ, TV, video, and other media as well as through listening to important speeches and work arrangements online. For the patients and their family members, they should receive education and training on epidemic prevention knowledge and information about special management requirements of the hospital during the epidemic through small unit modes such as bedside or nursing groups as well as through television, posters, and admission propaganda and education communication. Through multiple approaches, employees, patients, and family members can pay more attention to and understand the epidemic situation; gain enhanced awareness of prevention and control; master the right protection skills; and reduce the chance of cross\u2010infection.",

Primary prevention and control monitoring are set up at the gate of the hospital, secondary monitoring is set up at the only entrance of the building, and tertiary monitoring is set up at each reception point and ward in the building. At each gate, professional nurses and security personnel are responsible for strict temperature monitoring, personnel identification, source inquiries, and registration of the personnel coming in and going out. The key questions are whether people entering the hospital come from Wuhan or other key epidemic areas, key patients are interrogated and closely monitored, and suspected patients are observed in time for timely isolation and treatment. To further ensure the effective implementation of various measures, the subdivision hospital also adopted a three\u2010level supervision mechanism. The first level is the director, who conducts site inspection once a week and carries out in\u2010depth supervision of the effectiveness of epidemic prevention in hospital areas, understands the daily epidemic situation and work situation, and then provides timely guidance and coordination in case of difficulty or doubt. The second level is the supervision of the department of infection control. Each unit is inspected at least three times a week to check whether the protective measures of various departments and personnel are in place and effective. The third level is the daily routine inspection of monitoring and protection of each unit of the hospital by the head nurse. The head nurse supervises the key monitoring links in the first and second levels to ensure the effective implementation of the measures in each link. In addition, the hospital accepts the supervision and inspection of local health law enforcement departments, thus forming the joint prevention and control of multiple departments.",

To avoid crowd gathering and reduce the close contact between people, the subdivision hospital and departments strictly implement the management of three channels. The patient channel is completely separated from the staff. Patients enter and exit the hospital following one way, and the staff enter and exit through another channel. Given that the main building of the hospital has only four floors, the elevators are divided into patient elevators and logistics elevators, and the employee elevator is no longer in use to encourage employees to use the stairs. All other channels are closed. Each channel has clear and eye\u2010catching signs for guidance; additional security, nursing personnel, volunteers, and other specially assigned staff are assigned supervision and guidance roles; and crowds are dispersed 1 meter apart to avoid contamination and close contact. Moreover, hospital fire inspection should be strengthened to ensure a special control period of fire safety. Canteen service is canceled, and delivery service is provided\n8\n to enhance the cleanliness and disinfection of the hospital floor and surface of objects. According to regulations for strengthening the management of medical waste of NCP, special routes are planned to strengthen the disinfection of sewage, and the frequency of testing is increased from quarterly to monthly. The cleaning, disinfection, and operation modes of the air\u2010conditioning ventilation system are in line with the requirements of the \u201ccleaning and disinfection code for centralized air\u2010conditioning and ventilation systems in public places\u201d (WS/T 396\u20102012). The operation mode is changed to the fresh air mode, the return air system is closed, the fresh air volume is increased, and the windows are frequently opened for ventilation.\n9\n, \n10\n\n",

All personnel were required to refrain from unnecessary medical activities and prohibited from walking to other places. To reduce crowd gathering, the number of companions was limited to one per patient, and whether visitors were allowed to stay depended on the condition of the patient. Each patient admitted to the hospital was required to fill out the \u201coutbreak\u2010related investigation form\u201d and signed the \u201cinformed consent form for accompanying management\u201d and \u201cepidemic commitment form.\u201d The management of all staff in medical care, work, property, administration, etc., was strengthened; those who had an epidemiologic history, fever, or other discomfort were strictly isolated, and daily monitoring and reporting were performed. Ophthalmology, otolaryngology, physical examination, endoscopy, etc., were stopped. The number of outpatients and inpatients was reduced, and all departments were to be gradually opened to the public according to the epidemic situation.\n8\n The admission and treatment of patients were carried out according to priority procedures, such as critical illness and restrictive surgery.",

From January 25 to February 27 (during the epidemic prevention and control period), a total of 8,863 outpatient patients, 3,874 hemodialysis patients, 3,400 inpatients, 119 surgeries, and 10 fever patients were protected from NCP, and no NCP occurred in the hospital. The control of epidemic prevention in the subdivision area was effective. Of course, all epidemic prevention measures are not immutable and need to be revised and adjusted according to the development of the epidemic situation and gradually improved. The only constant is the high and close attention to the epidemic situation. Effective emergency plans should be formulated from the very beginning, and safety control measures should be taken decisively. Only in this way can the infection be controlled to the minimum.",
