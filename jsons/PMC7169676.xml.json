            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) that arises by a mutation from the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Vennema et al., 1995). When FCoV is present in a cattery, it is likely to infect 90\u2013100% of the cats and all the cats are likely to be seropositive (Addie et al., 2000). The poor specificity of serological tests often induces use of other clinico\u2010pathological changes as diagnostic markers of FIP. Clinical findings are often non\u2010specific, especially in dry forms, and the diagnosis of FIP needs to be supported by the presence of non\u2010regenerative anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, lymphopenia, hyperproteinaemia, increased total\u2010, \u03b1\n2\u2010 and \u03b3\u2010globulins (Pedersen, 1995). Unfortunately, some of these changes can also appear in cats as a consequence of chronic inflammation, stress or crowding (Kristensen and Barsanti, 1977; Jain, 1993): in the case of fever, neurological signs, hepatic or renal failure because of diseases other than FIP, cats with the above\u2010mentioned laboratory alterations may be erroneously suspected to have FIP and isolated from the colony (Addie and Jarrett, 1995) or euthanasized.",

Based on these data, internal ranges of each parameter were calculated in all the colonies (Lumsden, 2000) in order to design the laboratory profile of each cattery and to look for any possible difference between these ranges and the reference ones. Results from cats with symptoms suggestive of FIP recorded in the same catteries since 1997 were also examined in order to check if the use of internal ranges would affect the possibility to correctly diagnose the disease.",

The avidin\u2013biotin complex (ABC) method with a commercially available kit (Vectastain Elite, Vector Labs Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) was used to detect the positive reaction, as previously described (Hsu et al., 1980), after inhibition of the endogenous peroxidase (H2O2 1% in methanol) and antigen unmasking using microwave pre\u2010treatment (two cycles of 5 min in citrate\u2010buffered solution, 0.01 m, pH 6.2). 3\u2010Amino\u20109\u2010ethyl\u2010carbazole or diaminobenzidine served as chromogen for the reaction and the slides were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxilin. Some sections of each sample were used as negative controls, with the primary antibody substituted by an equal amount of normal mouse serum (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). In each session of immunohistochemical test, a section of liver with a fibrinous perihepatitis from a cat with FIP was used as a positive control.",

This cat was treated with sulfamethopyrazine (Vetkefizina\u00ae, Ceva Vetem) and had a complete recovery. Cat nos.10 and 40 had fever of unknown origin (FUO) that persisted for about 1 month in spite of different antibiotic therapies. Fever disappeared using Cefazoline (Cefamezin\u00ae, Pharmacia) and Enrofloxacin (Baytril\u00ae, Bayer), respectively. Both these cats were still alive after 2 years (cat no.10) and 4 years (cat no. 40) and did not show any other symptoms consistent with FIP: the observed FUO can thus be interpreted as a consequence of some bacterial infection responsive only to Cefazoline and Enrofloxacin, respectively. Cat no. 9 had fever, jaundice and a peritoneal effusion on which neutrophils, many of which degenerated, and lymphocytes were detectable. At the necropsy, a multi\u2010focal to coalescing severe necrotizing and suppurative hepatitis was detectable (Fig. 1). Cat no. 33 had fever, weakness and a progressive paralysis of the leg: large and immature myeloid cells were detectable in both peripheral blood and bone marrow (Fig. 2) suggesting the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), most likely myelomonocytic. Histology confirmed this diagnosis (Fig. 3). Cat no. 34 had a thoracic effusion on which clusters of epithelial cells with cytologic patterns consistent with the diagnosis of neoplasia were detectable (Fig. 4). At the necropsy, pulmonary carcinoma was diagnosed (Fig. 5). Immunohistochemistry for FCoVs was negative in all these cats.",

But also the non\u2010symptomatic cats of the same cattery had altered parameters. As a consequence, mean values and internal ranges calculated using the lowest and the highest values observed at each sampling, as suggested by Lumdsen (2000) for small groups of animals, were strongly different not only among the catteries but also among the different samplings. In order to reduce the variability because of transient alterations, mean values and internal ranges have been calculated also based on the results recorded during the whole study period. Although this might not be considered statistically correct, it can be the best way to represent the real laboratory profile of cats living in small or medium catteries. The majority of breeding catteries, in fact, are composed by 5\u201330 animals and have \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018mixed\u2019 management, because of repeated participation in cat shows and frequent exchange of cats with other catteries. In this situation, it is quite impossible to use a wide statistical approach and to avoid mild to moderate outbreaks of infectious diseases that can induce transient fluctuations of laboratory parameters.",

            "text": "The comparison of mean values obtained in the whole study period allowed to detect that, with the exception of total protein concentration that was in all the catteries close to the highest limit of the reference range, as already reported for colony cats (Kristensen and Barsanti, 1977; Kaneko, 1997), each cattery was characterized by a particular laboratory profile and, as a consequence, by the presence of cats with some parameter out of the reference range. The presence of these changes seems to depend on the characteristic of the cattery rather than on the prevalence of FIP. In fact, the most evident haematological and eletrophoretic changes were detected in catteries 3 and 4, which had a high prevalence of FIP, open management and a poor health condition, while they were rare in cattery 1, which also had a high prevalence of FIP but close management practices and few cases of infectious diseases. The high number of lymphocytes in cattery 6 may depend on the recent appearance of FIP, as lymphoid hyperplasia in cats living with FCoV shedders has been reported (Kipar et al., 1999). These suggestions can be confirmed by the analysis of the number of cats per cattery that had, at least in one sampling, values different from the reference range: also in this case, the number of cats with laboratory changes was low in cattery 1 and high in catteries 3 and 4. The high number of cats with hyperproteinaemia in catteries 2 and 5 might depend on their high percentage of old cats, which are known to have high total protein concentration (Kaneko, 1997). Moreover, all the cats from cattery 6 had increased \u03b1\n2\u2010globulins and this might be further support to the hypothesis of a recent contact with the FCoV, as an increase of this electrophoretic fraction has been recorded just after experimental infection with the FCoV, most likely depending on the increase of acute phase proteins (Stoddart et al., 1988). However, it must also be considered that it is very likely to find at least one change compared with a range, when seven parameters are considered for three time\u2010samplings. For this reason, also the presence of multiple laboratory alterations, that has a high diagnostic value for FIP (Sparkes et al., 1991; Pedersen, 1995), was evaluated. The type of change most frequently observed, however, was very variable among the catteries, most likely depending on the laboratory profile of each cattery. In fact, cats with simultaneous changes were mainly detected in catteries 3 and 4, with electrophoretic changes associated with lymphopenia in cattery 3 and neutrophilia in cattery 4.",

A possible consequence of using internal ranges would be the lack of ability to identify cats with FIP.

These parameters were not calculated in this study because they have a statistical validity only if calculated on large populations with known prevalence of infection (Jacobson, 1991) and, as previously mentioned, such a situation rarely occurs in breeding catteries. Only in catteries 1, 3 and 4 were both cats with FIP and with other diseases sampled. However, sensitivity and specificity can be interpreted as the possibility to avoid false negative and false positive results, respectively. On this perspective, in some cats with FIP values out of the reference range fell into the internal ones, thus decreasing the sensitivity of these changes (hyperproteinaemia in cattery 1, lymphopenia in cattery 3, neutrophilic leucocytosis in cattery 4). In contrast, the number of cats without FIP with anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis and increased \u03b1\n2\u2010globulins recorded in cattery 1 was higher compared with the internal ranges than compared with the reference ones. The specificity of these changes thus decreased, but, except for \u03b3\u2010globulin concentration, their sensitivity increased, as the number of cats with FIP that had these changes compared to internal ranges, was higher than compared to the reference ones.",

This risk might be avoided by using internal ranges, calculated on the basis of the results of repeated samplings from cats without symptoms consistent with FIP. The use of these internal ranges rarely affects the possibility to correctly diagnose the disease in cats with symptoms suggestive of FIP.",
