As mentioned above, TLRs are type I transmembrane and endosomically expressed proteins that are evolutionarily conserved and have been identified as the key pathogen recognition receptors in innate immunity. TLRs 1 through 10 are present on human innate immune cells and act through cellular signal cascade to augment host immune response through inflammation. TLR agonists can modify host inflammatory responses, potentially offering increased protection from infection. Currently, TLR agonists are licensed and being used in human subjects in the setting of microbial infection and cancer. They can be tailored to specific diseases and administered through multiple routes. Microbial ligands recognized by TLRs are constitutively expressed and highly conserved structural molecules less prone to rapid genetic mutation, and thus TLR agonists are less likely to select for resistant strains (\nFig 1).",

Potent antiviral activity in mouse and primate models against herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Banzivirus, Rift Valley fever, influenza, and West Nile has been demonstrated. Their IRM models also suggest utility against Leishmania, Listeria, and Mycobacterium species. Imiquimod is currently applied 2 to 3 times per week with active immunomodulatory effects between treatments. IRM models suggest administration 3 to 4 days before exposure provides adequate anti-infective protection. Rare inflammatory side effects have been reported, specifically in those with T cell\u2013mediated autoimmune disorders that subside after therapy is discontinued. Potential systemic side effects, such as fever, are possible in conjunction with cytokine toxicity. Genetic polymorphisms might play a role in response variability. 3M screened blood from more than 100 individuals and demonstrated variable IRM response, but cytokine production was observed in all subjects. Fatigue and influenza-like symptoms have been reported with use. There is concern about the relationship between TLR7 agonists and autoimmune disease; however, in extensive preclinical and clinical trials with IRMs, autoimmunity has not been observed. Aldara (imiquimod 5% cream) has gone through phase III clinical trials and is approved for the treatment of external genital warts, actinic keratosis, and basal cell carcinoma. Other TLR7/TLR8 agonists are in preclinical and clinical development for multiple indications, including cervical HPV infection.",

Three different classes of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are distinguished by their structure and immune effects. A-class (also known as type D) CpG ODNs stimulate plasmacytoid DCs to secrete high levels of IFN-\u03b1 and natural killer (NK) cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3,5 as well as monocyte maturation into functional DCs,6 with little IL-6 or B-cell stimulation. Conversely, B-class (type K) CpG ODNs induce modest IFN-\u03b1 production, weak NK cell activation, and profound B-cell and monocyte activation, with secretion of IgM, IL-10, and IL-6.7 C-class CpG ODNs have intermediate immune effects7 and are very stable in vivo, with easy formulation. CPG 7909, a B-class ODN, was the first ODN to enter clinical trials in 1999. CPG 10101, a C-class ODN, recently entered clinical trials as monotherapy for chronic HCV infection. A recently developed type of CpG ODN (fma CpG ODN) by Daniela Verthelyi and Serge Beaucage at the FDA has an altered chemistry that will allow for CpG ODNs to be prepared as prodrugs, thereby easing their production (Beaucage and Verthelyi, unpublished data).",

A single-dose, dose-escalation, phase I clinical trial with intranasally delivered CRX-675 (a moderate-strength TLR4 agonist) is currently underway for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. CRX-527 is a highly active synthetic TLR4 agonist that induces innate resistance to airway challenge by viral and bacterial pathogens. Studies in mice have demonstrated that CRX-527 enhances protective immunity in the airways to L monocytogenes, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Haemophilus influenzae, with resistance to infection persisting between 4 and 7 days accompanied by induction of cytokines, chemokines, defensins, and type 1 IFNs. Animal models suggest response within hours of administration and lasting up to a week. Weekly or biweekly administration can extend protection without inducing tolerance. Protective doses of CRX-527 are significantly lower than toxic doses, suggesting a safe therapeutic index.19, 20 A phase I, multidose, dose-escalation trial with CRX-527 (a high-activity TLR4 agonist) is scheduled for early 2006. It is expected that CRX-527's effects will last between 3 and 7 days, with biweekly dosing extending the duration for 6 to 12 weeks. Redosing might avoid prolonged innate stimulation and potential autoimmune reactions. Biweekly intranasal delivery has not been associated with systemic inflammation. Corixa does not anticipate that genetic polymorphism will significantly affect TLR4 agonist responses; however, a recent study suggests phylogenetic and individual diversity in TLR4 responses, suggesting possible variability in efficacy for TLR4 agonists. A phase I clinical trial with CRX675 was recently completed, with no serious or severe adverse events reported. Additional clinical trials with CRX527 (phase I safety study) and CRX675 (phase II) are planned for 2006.",

Exogenous administration of IFNs will activate antiviral pathways faster than TLR ligands and might be an effective form of preventative therapy before and after exposure for certain viral infections. Anticipated duration is between days and weeks for a daily dose of IFNs given for 5 to 14 days (or biweekly doses given over 1 to 2 weeks if using pegylated IFNs). There are side effects to chronic IFN treatment seen thus far in HBV and HCV treatment, including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, depression, nausea, weight loss, musculoskeletal pain, and leucopenia. However, midterm to long-term protection can be administered for weeks to months at nontoxic doses. Prophylaxis through IFNs could trigger harmful inflammation because IFN therapy has resulted in autoimmune reactions in various case reports with large doses of IFNs. Smaller doses over a short period of time or autoantibody serial testing to monitor for exacerbations might limit possible autoimmune reactions. Genetic polymorphism is likely to play a role in IFN responsiveness. Race appears to affect responsiveness to IFN therapy in HCV (African American subjects have a reduced response relative to white subjects). Published data cited by AFG Biosolutions demonstrate the safety of aerosol IFNs; however, in-depth evaluation for treatment in infectious diseases in human subjects must be demonstrated. Literature from the mid-1980s using aerosolized IFNs for treatment of rhinovirus infections shows that aerosolized IFNs resulted in some reduction in virus replication but little relief from symptoms and increased blood and nasal secretions compared with placebo.25, 26 Inhaled IFN is likely to have similar side effects to current routes of administration, which might be acceptable in the setting of a biothreat agent (BTA).

Anti-HMGB1 antibodies have been shown to prevent death in animal models by inhibiting the activity of HMGB1, which disrupts epithelial cells in organs.30 Tracey and colleagues are currently investigating this possibility for \u03b17 expression and cholinergic agonist responsiveness. CAP68 (acetylcholine agonist) is a small molecule that prevents overproduction of cytokines like TNF and HMGB1. This is accomplished by targeting \u03b17 receptors on macrophages, which in turn inhibit nuclear factor \u03baB activity, the cytokine regulator responsible for the release of the lethal cytokines TNF and HMGB1. Blocking HMGB1 has already been shown to prevent death caused by peritonitis,30 supporting CAP68's possible role in lethal infection. It is likely that anti-HMGB1 antibodies will enter clinical trials within 12 to 18 months.",

            "text": "After review of the literature and submitted proposals, we suggest the following responses to Hackett's questions:1.In theory, the most broadly active immunopotentiators should yield the broadest protective response. Candidates for innate immune receptor activation include TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TH1, CD4, and the IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 receptors. Concern exists for variable expression of targets between small animal models and human models (eg, human subjects express TLR9 and TLR8, whereas mice only express TLR9 but in a much greater variety of cell types). Thus a correlate between the efficacy and duration seen in animal models must take into account these species-specific differences to accurately represent human response to immunomodulation. The most likely route of attack (respiratory or gastrointestinal) is probably the ideal route of protection to minimize drug exposure.2.Innate immunity is relatively brief in duration, especially in the absence of an active threat or stimulus. Protection with immunomodulators usually lasts between 1 and 2 weeks, regardless of the mechanism targeted. The potential for readministration should extend the protective effects for greater than 2 weeks. The exact duration will vary on mechanism of action, delivery method, and any adverse effects of chronic use.3.Enhancing innate immunity carries an inherent risk of inflammatory response. Some immunomodulators, such as TLR4 agonists, raise concerns for the possibility of innate overactivity on the basis of their pivotal role in the development of septic shock.4.Some individuals are more prone to autoimmune reaction or retroviral activation with innate immunomodulation. This becomes increasingly more likely if the target yields polyclonal B-cell activation (ie, TLR9 and TLR7/TLR8 agonists) because of increased likelihood for loss of self-tolerance and development of autoantibodies. There is also some concern for the possible relationship between IFN and autoimmunity that remains to be established.5.Genetic polymorphism is an important potential variable, depending on the molecular target selected for therapy. Better comprehension of genetic variability could lead to improved treatment for nonresponders and discovery of novel targets for innate immunomodulation and could affect adverse events (inflammatory response) in predisposed individuals.\n",
