            "text": "Coronaviruses are a family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory pathogen of chickens that can also affect the kidneys and reproductive systems (Raj & Jones, 1996; Cavanagh, 2005), therefore resulting in both bird mortality and decreased reproductivity (Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000). As with all coronaviruses, the IBV input genomic RNA is translated by host cell ribosomes to generate an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rep1a, Rep1ab) (Lai & Cavanagh, 1997). This complex is responsible for the transcription of viral subgenomic mRNAs via a discontinuous mechanism (Pasternak et al., 2006) and the generation of new genomic RNA. Both the genomic and subgenomic mRNA are 3\u2032 co-terminal and share a common 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), whereas the 5\u2032 end of the genomic mRNA has a unique 5\u2032 UTR.",

The problem of vaccination efficiency against IBV is compounded due to the extensive antigenic variation between different strains (Jackwood et al., 2005; Bochkov et al., 2006), caused by the high frequency of mutations due to error-prone replication and also recombination (Wang et al., 1993; Kottier et al., 1995; Lee & Jackwood, 2000). Other important steps that are taken to control IBV infection are serological monitoring to determine virus exposure, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and haemagglutination inhibition to detect IBV antibodies (Adzhar et al., 1996; Chen et al., 2003). Due to the high probability of new and emerging strains of IBV and other coronaviruses in general, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Peiris et al., 2004), the need to develop alternative strategies to vaccination is paramount (Cavanagh, 2003, 2005; Weiss & Navas-Martin, 2005).",

After these treatments the amount of virus was determined by plaque assay. The data indicated that there was no significant variation in virus titre of IBV treated with the range of LiCl concentrations, and therefore LiCl did not have a direct virucidal effect on IBV (Figure 3). However, temperature was shown to influence the IBV titre; when the virus was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the titre was approximately 10-fold higher than when the virus was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 16 h.

The potential effect of LiCl on cellular protein expression was determined by examining the amount of GAPDH, a cellular housekeeping protein, compared with total protein present. Cell lysates were prepared from either mock-infected or IBV-infected Vero and DF-1 cells either untreated or treated with 5 to 50 mM LiCl. The yield of total protein was determined using the BCA assay and equivalent amounts of protein extract from each experimental treatment used for western blot analysis. The data indicated that the amount of N protein decreased in proportion to the amount of LiCl treatment with apparent abrogation in the amount of N protein when either Vero or DF-1 cells are treated with 50 mM LiCl. Western blot analysis indicated that the amount of GAPDH did not vary between LiCl-treated or untreated Vero or DF-1 cells. Thus the effect of LiCl on the amount of protein was specific to IBV (Figure 4).\n",

Previous studies on herpes simplex virus have shown that LiCl inhibits DNA synthesis (Skinner et al., 1980), and therefore it is possible to tentatively hypothesize that LiCl may inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are characteristic of positive and negative stranded RNA viruses. One possibility is that the activity of components of the IBV-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases may be affected by LiCl. As the activity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus helicase is magnesium dependent (Tan et al., 2004), and metal ions can also inhibit the activity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3CL protease (Hsu et al., 2004), the same may also be true for IBV. Another precedence for this is the inhibition by LiCl of the activity of certain cellular proteins. For example, LiCl can inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta by several different mechanisms (Doble & Woodgett, 2003; Jope, 2003), including competition for magnesium ions (Ryves et al., 2002). These hypotheses were tested by comparing the levels of viral RNA between infected cells treated and untreated with LiCl.",
