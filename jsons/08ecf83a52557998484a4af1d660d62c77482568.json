An excess of the tertiary base had to be used in the reaction for temporary protection of the sterically hindered 30-COOH of the aglycon. The formation of the CONH bond in activated ester 3 was a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction that formed the desired product as a result of elimination of the OSu group. The resulting HOSu remained in the aqueous solution during isolation of the reaction products whereas the target carboxy-substituted GA conjugates were insoluble in H 2 O and precipitated.",

The cytotoxicity and antiviral activities of the compounds were studied on passaged human T-lymphocyte (MT-4) culture for the traditional model of acute HIV-1 infection using strain HIV-1/EVK as before [8, 9] . The antiviral activity was assessed by the reduction of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and inhibition of virus antigen accumulation (virus-specific protein p24) on the fourth day of cultivation using an immuno-enzyme analysis method in culture fluid and comparison with a control (without added compound). Furthermore, the fraction of viable cells was determined after staining with trypan blue by counting in a Goryaev chamber. The known anti-HIV drug azidothymidine (AZT) and purified (97%) 18E-GA were used as references [10] . The mechanism of action of the former is related to blockage of viral RT and termination of viral DNA synthesis. Table 1 presents the experimental results.",
