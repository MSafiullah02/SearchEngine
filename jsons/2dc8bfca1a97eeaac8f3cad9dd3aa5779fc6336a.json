Detailed methods are presented for expression, purifi cation, and release testing of SARS recombinant spike protein antigen, followed by adjuvant formulation and animal testing.

Before being controlled by quarantine measures, ~8000 humans were infected, with fatality as high as 50 % in the elderly and an overall case fatality rate of ~10 % [ 2 ] . More recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) has caused a series of serious and, in some cases, fatal human infections [ 3 ] . Given the risk of future serious human coronavirus outbreaks, development of a suitable vaccine platform to protect against such viruses is a major priority. These vaccines present several challenges including the rapidity with which these outbreaks develop and hence the need for rapid vaccine manufacture. Hence, a successful coronavirus vaccine platform must overcome multiple challenges. SARS CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus 29.7 kb in length with 14 open reading frames [ 4 ] . Initial SARS vaccine candidates were produced from inactivated virus. Inactivated whole-virus vaccines provided only modest protection, inducing low-neutralizing antibody titers that did not protect against infection but were associated with faster lung clearance of virus [ 5 ] . However, immunization of mice with inactivated vaccines either alone or formulated with alum adjuvant resulted in severe lung eosinophilic pathology in response to virus challenge [ 6 -9 ] , similar to enhanced lung pathology seen with SARS virus reexposure after primary infection [ 10 ] . Hence a major challenge when developing a SARS vaccine is to identify strategies to avoid lung eosinophilic pathology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 213, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 271, "end": 276, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 443, "end": 448, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 596, "end": 601, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1089, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1370, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1561, "text": "[ 6 -9 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1655, "end": 1661, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A further challenge when developing vaccines based on inactivated SARS virus is the need for high-containment biosafety level 3 cGMP manufacturing facilities [ 11 ] .

S protein could thereby provide an ideal antigen with which to induce neutralizing antibodies against SARS virus [ 14 , 15 ] . However, while immunization with S protein in animal models provided some protection against SARS virus [ 16 , 17 ] , S protein-immunized animals when subsequently challenged with live virus developed severe lung eosinophilic immunopathology, with this problem exacerbated even further when S protein vaccine was formulated with alum adjuvant [ 6 , 9 ] . A similar problem of lung eosinophilic immunopathology has been seen with other viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, which prime for an excessive and harmful Th2-dominated lung immune response upon subsequent virus exposure [ 18 ] . Lung eosinophilic immunopathology is exacerbated by formulation of such vaccines with any adjuvant that induces excess Th2 immune polarization, e.g., aluminum salt adjuvants [ 6 , 9 ] . Hence, while S protein would appear to be an ideal SARS vaccine antigen, there is fi rst the need to reduce the risk of lung eosinophilic immunopathology being induced by the vaccine.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 290, "text": "[ 12 , 13 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 406, "end": 417, "text": "[ 14 , 15 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 524, "end": 535, "text": "[ 16 , 17 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 763, "end": 772, "text": "[ 6 , 9 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1030, "text": "[ 18 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1216, "text": "[ 6 , 9 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Described below are methods used for the development and manufacture of a recombinant subunit vaccine based on an S protein antigen lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (S \u0394TM) that was expressed using a baculovirus insect cell expression platform.

The recombinant protein expressed by this vector was termed SARS S \u0394TM. This truncated version of the S protein was selected as it contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and was able to be expressed in insect cells at a higher level than the full-length membrane-bound version. The SARS S RBD has been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies against the SARS CoV [ 14 , 15 ] . After infection of expres SF+ \u00ae insect cells with the recombinant baculovirus, the S \u0394TM protein is expressed and secreted into the cell culture medium [ 17 ] . The procedure detailed below for purifying the SARS S \u0394TM protein can be followed after production of the protein in a baculovirus/insect cell system. The process is designed for a 45 L fermentation in a 60 L bioreactor but may be adjusted to other scales as necessary. Following harvest, the SARS S \u0394TM protein is purifi ed by column chromatography; a schematic is provided in Fig. 1 . In the fi rst step, the supernatant is fl owed through linked UNOsphere S (UNO S) and DEAE sepharose columns. DNA and protein impurities are removed, and the SARS S \u0394TM protein remains in the fl ow through. The fl ow through from the UNO S/ DEAE step is applied to lentil lectin sepharose, SARS S \u0394TM binds, and impurities are removed. Following elution from the lentil lectin sepharose column, the protein is concentrated, and buffer is exchanged by ultrafi ltration. The retentate from the ultrafi ltration step is processed through a 0.22 \u03bcm fi lter, and the purifi ed protein is stored at \u221220 \u00b0C.
