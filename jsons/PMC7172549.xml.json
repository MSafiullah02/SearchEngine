The heptanucleotide or so-called shifty sequence has an X XXY YYZ consensus, where X can be any base, Y is A or U and Z is A, U or C. It is thought that when this sequence enters the A and P site of the ribosome, the pseudoknot structure causes pausing of the ribosome, giving time to shift to the \u22121 reading frame. Although in most cases a pseudoknot is found to be responsible for ribosomal frameshifting, also a hairpin structure in HIV 8 and Escherichia coli dnaX\n9, 10 and a three-way junction in IS911 11 have been shown to be functionally active. Whether the pseudoknot structure acts as an independent unit, regulating the ribosomal frameshift by its structure or stability, or acts in concert with auxiliary proteins is still not understood. The importance of its structural identity is evident, however, since pseudoknots can for instance not be replaced by a functionally different pseudoknot 12 or replaced by a hairpin with a similar base-pair composition. 13\n",

These base-pairs are probably important for function: in almost all frameshifting pseudoknots, S1 starts with three or four G-C base-pairs, and mutational studies showed that changing the third base-pair decreased frameshift efficiency by approximately 50%. 17 To be able to study a monomeric RNA pseudoknot (iv) we changed the second base-pair of S1 into a C-G base-pair, thereby interrupting the stretch of four guanosine bases. This mutation resulted in a complete disappearance of the two broad imino-proton peaks around 11 ppm supporting our hypothesis that the multimerization was due to the four consecutive guanines.",

At the 5\u2032-end of L2, at C20, the backbone turns sharply into the opposite direction and is held in position by A21, which forms two hydrogen bonds between its N1 and the amino proton of G18, and between its amino proton to the O2 of C2 (Figure 5(b)). Subsequently, A21 serves as a platform for consecutive stacking of all residues up to U27, with the exception of C24. A23 and A25 are stacked, evidenced by NOEs from the H2 of A23 to the H2 and H1\u2032 of A25, while C24 is bulged. The dynamic properties of C24 (visualized in Figure 4(d)) are transposed to the next residue and cause line broadening of the aromatic proton resonances of A25. However, in the calculated structures A25 is firmly held in position close to the minor groove connected by a strong NOE between its H2 and C17H1\u2032 (Figure 2(a)). No hydrogen bonds can be detected between residues 22-25 and S1, so it appears that the structure of this part of L2 is primarily formed by stacking interactions between the adenine bases.",

Most of the interactions between S1 and L2 consist of base triple formation between adenines in the loop and the bases of the base-pairs in the stem. We want to mention the one exception, namely the A26:G4-C16 base triple, which is stabilized by a single base zipper motif (Figure 5(c)). Intramolecular ribose zippers, unique to RNA since hydroxyl groups are involved, have previously been observed in the P4-P6 domain of group I intron ribozymes, 31 the HDV ribozyme 32 and the L11-binding domain of 23 S rRNA. 33, 34 In these structures at least two pairs of riboses interact by hydrogen bonding to form the ribose zippers, which are characterized by shared hydrogen bonds between the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group and a pyrimidine O2 (or purine N3) of one nucleotide and the 2\u2032-hydroxyl of its partner. In the SRV-1 pseudoknot the riboses of the next residues in the stack, U27 and G15, are not participating in the ribose zipper. Therefore, in a more general sense the hydrogen-bonding pattern found here for a single ribose pair might be considered the signature of a ribose zipper motif.",

Different views, however, have been articulated for the presence of the U29-A13 base-pair at the junction. In the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) pseudoknot an unpaired adenine was found at the junction, leading to a bent pseudoknot, which has been proposed to be an essential structural feature for frameshifting. 36, 37 The MMTV pseudoknot and variants thereof with an intercalated adenine base at the junction showed frameshift efficiencies of about 20%. For variants without an intercalated adenine the frameshift efficiencies were much lower (2%). Functional data 38 led to the proposal that the SRV-1 pseudoknot would, at the dispense of the U29-A13 base-pair, also contain an unpaired intercalating adenine at the junction to create this characteristic bent conformation. 37 Mutational studies 39 of the SRV-1 pseudoknot in which the uridine had been changed into all other three nucleotides without affecting frameshift efficiency further supported this hypothesis. In our work, however, we firmly assigned a hydrogen bonded U29 imino proton and unambiguously established the presence of a closed U29-A13 base-pair at the junction. Earlier work by Hoffman and co-workers, who were able to assign the U29 imino proton, also indicated the presence of this base-pair. 40 Thus, an unpaired, intercalated nucleotide at the junction is not necessarily required for efficient frameshifting of the SRV-1 pseudoknot.",

This graph shows that for canonical A-type RNA the shortest phosphorous-phosphorous distance (\u223c8 \u00c5) occurs after a build-up with seven base-pairs, thus leaving a gap that can be bridged by one (or two) nucleotides. The distances measured in the TYMV and SRV-1 pseudoknots nearly coincide. In the SRV-1 pseudoknot a distance of 6.8 \u00c5 is reached when S2 is six base-pairs long. This distance can easily be bridged by one nucleotide. A similar situation obtains in the TYMV pseudoknot. Here S2 is five base-pairs long and the remaining gap, 11 \u00c5, can be spanned by two nucleotides, the effective length of L1. In the BWYV pseudoknot the situation is significantly different. Here the phosphorous atoms of the third and fourth base-pair of S2 are already at a distance of 6.5 \u00c5 from the sampling phosphate. Again this distance can be, and in fact is spanned by one nucleotide. Below it will be discussed that the twist angle between the two base-pairs at the pseudoknot junction is an essential element in imposing these differences.",

First, it facilitates bridging of the major groove of S2 by a small number (one or two) of nucleotides. Secondly, it opens the minor groove at the junction to accommodate base triple formation in the TYMV 20, 16 and the SRV-1 pseudoknots (Figure 4) or base quadruple formation in the BWYV pseudoknot. 21 Formation of the base quadruple in the latter molecule also accounts for the large difference with the proposed secondary structure model.",

Subsequently, the upper part of the helix (cylinder) is rotated by 180\u00b0 around an axis perpendicular to the plane through the mentioned base-pair, taking the point where the helix axis crosses the plane as the pivot point. If one takes the base-pair tilt equal to 45\u00b0 it can be envisaged easily that the combined large twist and tilt angles lead to a bend of 90\u00b0 between the upper and lower part of the helix.

For this one has to realize that the number of base-pairs in the helical stems, S1 and S2, in the pseudoknots do not entail a complete helical turn, suggesting that the reported bends refer to local instead of global bends. To appreciate the importance of this remark a comparison with the situation in an A-type helix is enlightening. If one takes a perfect A-form helix of 12 base-pairs the apparent bend between the helix axis of the upper and lower 6 bp stems, generated by either programme Curves 42, 43 or NEWHEL93 (R.E. Dickerson, University of California, Los Angeles), amounts to \u223c22\u00b0. Thus, examination of two stacked helical A-type stems smaller than one helical turn by either these programmes or by eye inspection may lead to the conclusion that the molecule is bent while actually the global helix is straight. This does not mean that in pseudoknot structures no bending of the global helix axis occurs at all. It is, however, in our opinion rather modest.",

            "text": "The overwinding with the pivot point located at the centre of the helix is, however, not possible in practice. It would require a lengthening of the phosphorous-phosphorous distance, which is prohibited. In fact, variation of the distance between two consecutive phosphorous atoms in the same strand is only possible within small margins. In nucleic acid structures this is reflected in the presence of almost constant phosphorous-phosphorous distances. 44 This means that in reality the rotation axis has to be moved close to the cylinder wall. Then rotation of the upper part of the helix will leave the orientation of its helix axis unaltered with respect to the same rotation in the situation above. However, this rotation will now result in a shift of the helical centre of the upper with respect to that of the lower helix in the intersecting plane. This is illustrated in Figure 8(b), where the effect of overwinding to a helical twist of 49\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 in the SRV-1 and BWYV pseudoknot, respectively, is compared with the situation in a normal A-type helix. In Figure 8(b) the black rectangle represents the last base-pair of the lower helix, and the grey shaded rectangles represent base-pairs in the upper helix stacked upon the last base-pair of the lower helix. Build up of the upper helix in the normal A-type helix by seven base-pairs brings, in this two-dimensional projection, the 5\u2032 terminus of the upper stem, indicated by the little sphere attached to the upper base-pair, close to the 3\u2032 terminus of the lower stem, indicated by the little sphere attached to the black base-pair. This results in a distance of\u223c8 \u00c5 between these terminal phosphates (cf Figure 8(b)). In the SRV-1 pseudoknot the twist angle between the upper base-pair of the lower helix (stem S1) and the lowest base-pair in the upper helix (stem S2) amounts to 49\u00b0, giving rise to a shift of the helix centre of the upper helix, as can be seen from the shift of the upper helix with respect to that of the lower helix. Note that the rotation is around the pivot point P located at the crossing of the two circumferences, leaving the distance of the consecutive phosphorous atoms of the upper base-pair of stem S1 and the lowest base-pair of stem S2 virtually unaltered. A build up of the upper helix by six base-pairs brings its 5\u2032 terminus as close to the 3\u2032 terminus of the lower stem as the similar build up by seven base-pairs in the A-type helix. This clearly underscores the proposition that increasing the twist angle shortens the distance between the two termini in nice correspondence with the results depicted in Figure 7(b). The effect is even more dramatic in the BWYV pseudoknot. A twist angle of 90\u00b0 between the base-pairs at the pseudoknot junction leads to a much larger shift between the centres of the helices, leading to a short distance of the free termini of the upper and lower stems after a build up with three base-pairs and the stacking adenine. Again this nicely conforms to the experimental results in Figure 7(b).",

The absence of interactions between the single L1 residue A7 and the major groove of S2 strongly suggests that neither the identity of the crossing nucleotide nor the base-pair composition of S2 is important for frameshifting. This fully agrees with the various SRV-1 pseudoknots mutated in this region, that only show slight changes in frameshift efficiencies (Figure 9).\n18 The only known exception, i.e. a drop of 13% upon changing two G-C pairs into A-U pairs, supports the notion that base-pair composition of S2 is not important provided that stability is maintained. The intricate interactions at the S1-S2 junction and at the L2-S1 interface suggest that in this part of the pseudoknot the nucleotide composition is much more important. Again this concurs with the various mutational studies performed. The wild-type sequence at the 3\u2032-side of L2, CUUA, is apparently suboptimal in terms of efficiency, since deletion of two (CU) or three (GCU) residues from L2 was shown to increase frameshift efficiency to a level of 34% and 30%, respectively. 18 This suggests that the interactions at the L2-S1 interface, i.e. base stacking, base-triples and the ribose zipper motif, are probably important elements in the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. In other words, absence of the well-defined structure in the wild-type pseudoknot at the junction might explain the decrease in frameshift efficiency. When AG, which does not show direct contacts with S1, was deleted from the loop, frameshift efficiency was slightly less (21%) than the wild-type level (23%). In the case of deletion of CU, a guanosine is left between A26 and U27. Here the higher frameshift efficiency might be due to additional stacking interactions of the guanosine between A26 and U27 and a triple interaction with one of the base-pairs in S1. Further shortening of L2 progressively diminishes frameshift efficiency, which can be the result of disruption of the prime interactions at the junction by tension of a too short L2. When a block of three base-pairs in S1 is inverted, the frameshifting efficiency drops to 10%, 17 which can be attributed to the loss of two triple interactions. For our NMR studies we introduced a single base-pair inversion at G2-C18. In the NMR structure the sharp turn of L2 at the base of S1 is held by a hydrogen bond between the N1 and the amino proton of A21 and the amino proton of G18 and the O2 of C2, respectively. Although it can be envisaged that in the wild-type pseudoknot a similar hydrogen bond can be formed by shifting A21 slightly over in the L2 minor groove, this minor change might decrease the overall frameshift efficiency to the respectable value of 16%.",

This clearly shows the need for further structural and functional studies to fully comprehend the importance of the structural details of the SRV-1 pseudoknot. In particular, it will be very important to see whether the tertiary interactions at the junction as found in the pseudoknot structure of the SRV-1 derivative presented here are also present in the wild-type pseudoknot.

In line with this observation Brierley and co-workers 19 found for an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) derived pseudoknot an adenine at the 3\u2032-end of an 8 nt L2 essential for efficient ribosomal frameshifting. By increasing the size of the loop to 14 nt, the specific requirement of this adenine is lost. However, the IBV pseudoknot is structurally similar to the MMTV frameshifting pseudoknot with two nucleotides in L1 and an intercalating adenine at the junction. Since our structure of the SRV-1 pseudoknot is distinctly different from the MMTV pseudoknot 36 it is not evident that when the three bases (GCU), deleted from loop L2 in SRV-1, are reinserted, the typical structural features and requirement of adenine 28 is lost in SRV-1 as well.",

Beyond the A-type double helix, our poor knowledge on the structural properties of loops and bulges leaves us unable to explain the effect certain mutations have on the frameshift efficiency. Therefore it is important to understand the structural effect of subtle changes in the loops, such as the change of a single adenine in the IBV-based pseudoknot. 19 Further structural analyses by either NMR or crystallography not only of the wild-type sequences, but also of mutant pseudoknots are called for.",

Therefore, the discovery of a common feature present in all types of pseudoknots might provide a basis for a better understanding. In fact the only general feature that has been recognized so far for the frameshifting pseudoknots is the definition of formation of a classic pseudoknot itself: a single-stranded region which folds back and forms base-pairs with residues in a hairpin loop. Therefore, as a consequence of the pseudoknot structure, the translating ribosome proceeding along the mRNA will approach a hairpin structure and a third strand connected to the loop upstream. Unwinding of the pseudoknot might be difficult because of the stability of S2 and the loop-helix interactions, thereby leaving time for the ribosome to pause and shift to the \u22121 frame. Alternatively the specific interactions between L2 and the minor groove of S1 as seen in the SRV-1 pseudoknot that lead to the formation of a triple helix raises the intriguing possibility that a triple helix connected by a loop might be the recognition signal for a translating ribosome to frameshift.",

The final concentration of the unlabelled sample was 3 mM and 1-2 mM for the residue-specific 13C/15N-labelled RNA samples. Addition of 6 mM magnesium did not alter the chemical shifts or NOE patterns, indicating that the presence of magnesium does not influence the pseudoknot structure.",

NOE cross-peak volumes involving non-exchangeable protons from the 100 ms NOESY were converted into distance restraints using the approach as described by Barsukov and Lian, 59 which qualitatively takes care of spin diffusion, by using the H5-H6 NOEs (2.45 \u00c5) for short and intraresidue H1\u2032-H6/H8 NOEs of helical residues for longer distances (3.65 \u00c5 on average) for those cross-peaks that were only visible at longer mixing times. By this method, the distances that are derived from the 100 ms spectrum agree very well with those from longer mixing times, and the possibility of large errors exceeding the error bandwidth can be virtually excluded. Initially we made use of \u00b120% error bounds for distances derived from the 100 ms NOESY experiment, because in our experience this gives a higher convergence rate, while the number of violations is kept to a minimum. Additional tests, using larger (\u221230%/+40%) error bounds resulted in structures with virtually identical overall and local folds, albeit with slightly larger overall rmsds (1.84 \u00c5) and number of violations. Small NOEs taken from the 300 ms 3D NOESY-HMQC were subdivided in four classes strong (1.8-3.0 \u00c5), medium (2.0-4.0 \u00c5), and weak (3.0-5.0 \u00c5). Small NOEs from the 200 ms NOESY were classified as very weak (4.0-6.0 \u00c5). As spin diffusion might become important for a molecule of this size, the upper bound for very weak NOEs was set to 6 \u00c5, which is a rather conservative estimate. Distance bounds for partially overlapping peaks were set to 1.8-6.0 \u00c5. Non-NOEs (i.e. lower bounds of 4.5-5 \u00c5 between a given proton pair) were put in at later stages of the structure calculations when the distance between a given proton pair came out smaller than 5 \u00c5, while there was clearly no cross-peak visible in any of the NOE spectra. The given lower bound is very conservative, and had no influence on the calculated structures, but merely helps defining the allowed conformational space during the molecular dynamics runs. Non-NOEs were only included for residues for which we established separately that they are not involved in intermediate exchange. Scalar couplings between H1\u2032 and H2\u2032 were determined from a DQF-COSY and a NOESY experiment, and were converted to N- or S-type sugar puckers (using dihedral restraints) in case of small (<3 Hz) or high (>7 Hz) values, respectively. The sugar puckers of A21, A22, A23, C24 and C36 were left unrestrained because intermediate scalar couplings of 4-6 Hz were measured for these residues. All residues had intra residual H1\u2032/H2\u2032/H3\u2032 to H6/H8 NOE intensities that are indicative of an (-angle in the anti range, except for C24 and were therefore restrained 202(\u00b130)\u00b0 for the stem residues and 202(\u00b160)\u00b0 for the others.",

All residues within the stem regions were therefore assigned glycosidic and backbone torsion angles in accordance with canonical A-type RNA with error bounds of \u00b120\u00b0 for those residues. Distances relating to imino protons were conservatively estimated from a 300 ms NOESY spectrum. Hydrogen bond restraints, according to Saenger 60 with error bounds of 0.1 \u00c5, and planarity restraints were imposed for residues involved in Watson-Crick base-pairing, as evidenced by the imino proton spectra and all observed NOEs and chemical shifts. Hydrogen bond restraints for the two junctional base-pairs were loosened (i.e. error bounds were increased to 0.5 \u00c5) in order obtain a more unbiased result in this region of the RNA molecule. No standard restraints were imposed for any of the backbone torsion angles between the sugar of C6 to G8, and that of C19 to U29, to ensure an unbiased course of the polynucleotide chain. For these domains, the \u03b2 and \u03b3 torsion angles were left unrestrained, except for A29, for which we found evidence in the 1H-31P HETCOR experiment 55 to restrain \u03b2 to 0-120\u00b0. The angle \u03f5 was set to 225(\u00b160)\u00b0, in order to exclude the stereochemically forbidden gauche+ region.
