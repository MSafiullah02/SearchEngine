The median age of death was 69 years (48\u201394) with no significant difference between male and female subjects. We have read about the prevalence of a more severe disease course in men, but in this particular list, the difference is so striking that we cannot be completely sure that it is only attributable to sex-related biological factors.",

As we know, the Hungarian physician and scientist discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics. The mortality rate in April 1847 was 18%. After hand washing was initiated, the rates dropped to 2% in June and to 1% in July. However, he was severely opposed by the medical establishment of his time and his theories were not believed until he died alone, aged 47, in a psychiatric clinic after having been severely beaten. Interestingly, since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have witnessed a dramatic decrease of alert infections from multidrug-resistant organisms in our hospital. Could this be linked to the reinforced awareness of the importance of hands hygiene among health professionals?",

Although the average younger age and predominant female sex of nurses may have contributed to a milder course of their disease than that of medical doctors, we have reason to believe that another contributing factor may be the nurses\u2019 long-standing tradition of taking care of personal and environmental antiseptic and aseptic measures. In this regard, not only lies the risk of being infected but also the amount of initial viral load. Microbial load is a usual determinant of severity in infectious diseases and COVID-19 seems to make no exception. Among 76 patients admitted to a hospital in Nanchang, China, it was noted that the mean viral load of severe cases was 60 times higher than that of mild cases and these data remained stable for the first 12 days after onset [4].",

The dispute about the availability of personal protective equipment is beyond the purpose of this commentary. Time and other investigations will tell if medical subspecialties may have been linked to different rates of exposure and risk of contracting COVID-19. For sure, general practitioners were and are our first line of defense in the battle against the virus. Hopefully, they have not worked and died in vain. Disease course and hospitalization rate seem to have weakened and slowed down since the introduction of home health care nurse\u2013physician teams that visit patients at home providing early diagnostic and therapeutic support.",

Second, when we become patients, perspectives change suddenly both in coping with the disease and in coming back to our jobs.
