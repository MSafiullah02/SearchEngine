The countries of the study population were preselected to cover a wide range of pilgrims from different continents. The selection reflected the Hajj pilgrims' population, and included countries with MERS-CoV cases, countries with close geographic proximity to KSA, and countries with frequent and significant population movement from and to KSA. These countries included those with the highest annual number of Hajj pilgrims. The individuals chosen for the trail from the selected flights were recruited on a voluntary and random basis (by selecting every 4th pilgrim from the queue at the airport processing area upon arrival or before boarding returning flights) regardless of their age, gender, or medical conditions (excluding children). A standardized data collection form was used to obtain information regarding the participants' age, gender, country of origin, and medical conditions. Vaccination history was determined from the participants' vaccination documents.",

Briefly, nucleic acid was purified from a 200 \u00b5L volume of sample using Magna Pure LC nucleic acid extraction kit (Roche).

These results are in accordance with a previous cohort survey conducted during the 2012 Hajj, which showed lack of nasal carriage of MERS-CoV among French pilgrims returning from Hajj [21]. A cohort of 154 French Hajj pilgrims were systematically sampled with nasal swabs prior to returning to France, and screened for MERS-CoV using the same RT-PCR assay used in our study. Despite a high rate of respiratory symptoms (83.4%), including 41.0% influenza-like illness, no case of MERS-CoV nasal carriage was detected [21]. Although our cohort represents a small proportion of the overall Hajj pilgrim's population (>1.9 million in 2013), the results showed a lack of nasal carriage of MERS-CoV among pilgrims. In addition, the results showed the lack of transmission of the virus among pilgrims.",

By contrast, Breban and colleagues [22] calculated that the risk of MERS-CoV to have pandemic potential does not exceed 5%, but they did not take into account the effect of the Hajj mass gathering in their scenario. Memish et al [23] showed that circulation of the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia is much lower than it was feared, announced, or predicted, and that no significant rise in detection rates could be observed along 1 year. In addition, mass gatherings in KSA during the pilgrimages of 2012 and 2013 were associated neither with an increased number of cases, nor with reported clusters of cases [24], suggesting poor or moderate interhuman transmission. Our results support the latter and that MERS-CoV in its current form may not have the pandemic potential as those of other respiratory viruses, including that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [22].",

This advice was also endorsed by the US CDC for pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia for the 2013 Hajj. In our study, 15.3% of the population was \u226565 years old, and although data on underling health conditions were available for a minority of the cohort and only related to diabetes and hypertension, 18.7% had at least 1 of these 2 conditions. Both are disorders for which the Saudi MoH recommended potential participants postpone doing the Hajj in 2013. Although our results cannot be extrapolated to all Hajj pilgrims, they suggest that despite the MoH recommendations, a proportion of the pilgrims were unaware or did ignore this advice. This is not without precedent; a study of a cohort of 167 French pilgrims participating in the 2012 Hajj season found that 39% were over 65 years of age and 59% had at least 1 risk factor mentioned in the MERS-CoV MoH recommendations [21]. In 2013, in preparation of the Hajj, a similar study (360 French cohort) reported that 30.8% were over 65 years of age, and nearly half had at least 1 disorders for which the Saudi MoH recommended potential participants postpone doing the Hajj [25]. In the latter study, nearly 65% of the respondents were aware of the ongoing MERS epidemic in the KSA and 35.3% were aware of the Saudi MoH recommendations for at-risk pilgrims to postpone performing the Hajj in 2013. Among 179 at-risk individuals, none decided to cancel their participation in the Hajj, even after advice during pretravel consultation [25].",
