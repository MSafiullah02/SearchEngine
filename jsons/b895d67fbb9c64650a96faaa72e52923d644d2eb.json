With the advent of rehydration therapy, the mortality rate from acute diarrhea has decreased sharply, although persistent diarrhea (>14 days) remains a significant health burden. In the United States and in developing countries, infectious diarrhea remains a cause of considerable morbidity and health care expenditure. Infectious diarrhea has been estimated to be the major complaint in up to 10% of pediatric outpatient visits, with a cost to society of between $0.6 and $1 billion each year in the United States alone [1\u2022\u2022] .",

The epidemiology of these commonly found organisms has changed little over recent years. With the advent of more sophisticated technology (such as electron microscopy and immunologic antigen testing to identify new organisms), numerous potential pathogens have been implicated as factors in diarrhea. As modes of detection are becoming more advanced, identification of pathobiologic mechanisms is increasingly important because the presence of a microorganism in the stool does not prove a causal relationship to disease (diarrhea). Furthermore, the self-limiting nature of the majority of diarrheal diseases currently makes this expensive technology impractical for everyday use. Knowledge of the etiologic agents of infectious diarrhea and their pathologic mechanisms is also useful as new therapies in the treatment and prevention of diarrhea are developed. This review, though not intended to be all-inclusive, aims to address the causes of acute infectious diarrhea with emphasis on some of the more newly implicated pathogens and the therapeutic modalities involved in the treatment and prevention of these diseases.",

The majority of severe illness occurs in children aged under 2 years, after which natural immunity usually occurs [4] .

The disease-causing strains are organized into five major groups, largely by pathobiologic features inherent to their virulence. Enterotoxigenic E coli produces infant and traveler's diarrhea. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli, serotype O157:H7, is responsible for most instances of hemolytic-uremic syndrome and has been associated with outbreaks of infectious diarrhea in the United States. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli can also cause sporadic illness and may be the most common cause of infectious bloody diarrhea in North America [12, 13] . Enteroinvasive E. coli has been identified as a cause of shigella-like diarrheal illness. Enteropathogenic E. coli is a common cause of acute and persistent diarrhea among infants in the developing world. The pathogenic features of this organism include localized enterocyte adherence, microvillus membrane effacement, and initiation of several signal transduction pathways leading to intestinal secretion [14] . Enteroaggregative E. coli and diffuse enteroadherent E. coli are described on the basis of their adherence patterns to tissue culture cells. Enteroaggregative E. coli have been associated with acute and chronic diarrhea in Western Europe [15] , while diffuse enteroadherent E. coli have been suggested as a cause of diarrhea in Mayan children [16] . In a US multicenter study examining the etiology of outpatient nondysenteric diarrhea, the leading causes of bacterial disease were E. coli strains identified by a diffuse Hep-2 cell adherence pattern [1\u2022\u2022] . Little is known regarding the pathologic mechanisms in which diffuse and enteroaggregative E. coli cause diarrhea. The epidemiologic association of these organisms with diarrhea has led to speculation that they are indeed pathogenic. Aeromonas species are gram-negative, oxidase-positive rods that have been associated with diarrheal disease. They have been found with a frequency of 2% or higher in children with diarrhea but not in asymptomatic controls [17, 18] . Infection is more common in warmer months. The diarrhea is usually watery and self-limited, although bloody stools and persistent diarrhea may occur [17] . At least one human isolate of Aeromonas hydrophila has demonstrated a high degree of cytotoxicity [19\u2022] . Pleisomonas shigelloides, a related organism once classified as an Aeromonas species, can also cause human diarrheal illness.",

            "text": "Finally, Clostridium difficile has been clearly identified as playing a causal role in diarrhea. C. difficile is a grampositive, spore-forming anaerobe that has been long known to be involved in antibiotic associated colitis. Infection with the spore, acquired through an oral-fecal route, may result in a range of clinical outcomes including asymptomatic carriage and a fulminant pseudomembranous colitis that can require surgical intervention. Normal colonic flora can suppress colonization with this microorganism, which is almost always associated with previous antibiotic therapy. C. difficile exerts its effect mainly through toxin production. Toxin A is thought to be the predominant mediator of human disease by binding to an enterocyte surface receptor and activating an intracellular G-protein-dependent signal transduction pathway. Toxin B is tested for the most frequently in routine microbiology laboratory procedures. Recently, it has been suggested that, in children, testing for toxin B alone will miss some toxigenic C. difficile. In one study, 18.5% of patients with C. difficile were positive for toxin A alone, and 48% were positive for toxin B alone [22\u2022 ]. The frequency of misdiagnosis, therefore, decreases considerably when testing is performed for both toxins. Interestingly, 10% of term infants and 55% of neonates in intensive care units are C. difficile positive by cytotoxic assay and lack symptomatology [23] . It is possible that the infant intestine developmentally lacks the appropriate receptor or signaling pathway to mediate the toxic effect. The incidence of asymptomatic carriage in children aged over 2 years drops to approximately 3%, which is the colonization rate in adults. Symptoms, when they are present, usually include watery, nonbloody diarrhea accompanied by crampy abdominal pain and anorexia. In more severe cases this can be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Occasionally, colitis develops and is characterized by bloody stools and the development of pseudomembranes. A fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon may then develop, ultimately requiring surgical intervention [24\u2022 ]. Resolution of symptoms usually occurs within 3 days of initiating therapy.",

In an effort to document patterns of parasitism in the United States, results of 216,275 stool specimens collected by state laboratories were reviewed by the CDC. Giardia was present in 7.2% of stool specimens submitted to state diagnostic laboratories in 1987. This represents an almost twofold increase in the identification of Giardia lamblia over what was seen in 1979, with 40 states reporting increases [25] . More recently, in a limited multicenter epidemiologic study, Giardia was found in 22 of 147 pediatric patients (15%) with nondysenteric diarrhea, a finding that reflects a higher incidence in children [1\u2022\u2022] . CDC's FoodNet identified an incidence rate of Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora infections at 2.8 and 0.3, respectively, per 100,000 population in 1997 [11] . Data on the long-term trends of these infections are pending and important because they may reflect isolated outbreaks of these parasites during this time period. Other known pathogens, including Entamoeba histolytica, Isospora bella, and Balantidium coli, occur much less frequently.",

In 1985, Gorbach [29] identified a lactobacillus organism as a result of screening bacteria present in fermented milk products thought to be beneficial to human health. This lactobacillus species was acid-and bile-resistant, adhered to human intestinal epithelial cells, and had growth characteristics necessary for commercial development. This strain, identified as Lactob a c i l l u s G G , i s o n e o f s e v e r a l p r o b i o t i c s , o r nonpathogenic organisms, used to benefit human health by improving microbial balance [29] . Following this discovery, multiple candidate microorganisms were developed to aid in human disease. Of these organisms, Lactobacillus GG remains the most popular strain to be tested in controlled trials. The reader is referred to review articles by Vanderhoof et al. [30\u2022\u2022] and Golden [31] for a more comprehensive discussion of probiotics in pediatric disease. Lactobacillus has been used to study the prevention of diarrheal illness in undernourished infants in Peru. [32] . Lactobaccillus GG used daily for a period of 6 to 7 days over a 15month period has been shown to reduce the occurrence of acute diarrhea in undernourished, non-breast-fed infants aged 18 to 29 months but did not significantly affect younger infants or infants receiving breast milk. In addition, Lactobacillus GG has been shown to decrease the incidence of traveler's diarrhea when given as a prophylactic measure [33] . Lactobacillus was an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in a study of 71 Finnish children [34] . Results were modest, including decreased duration of diarrhea by approximately 1 day. Lactobacillus has been successful in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile diarrhea after standard therapy in four of five adults [35] and four children [36] . In the latter study, retreatment was necessary in two children after stools became toxin positive. Long-term follow-up demonstrated no relapse after 8 to 18 months. As our experience grows, probiotics are likely to find a place in the treatment of specific problems related to diarrheal illness.",

In addition to the rotavirus vaccine, immunization strategies are being developed or have been developed for numerous enteric pathogens. The ways in which vaccines are developed is also evolving. The hypothesis that an immune response can be invoked by antigens found in foodstuffs, along with the technology of plant recombinant genetics, have led to the concept of transgenic foods as vehicles for active immunization. Fourteen human volunteers in a preliminary trial were asked to eat a potato product transformed with the B subunit of heat labile toxin of enterotoxigenic E. coli. This activity resulted in mucosal and serologic immune responses similar to those induced by the organism itself [44\u2022\u2022] . In addition, several animal studies have validated the concept of using plant products transformed with the Norwalk virus capsid protein as potent vaccines [45] . Human trials with this immunization strategy are pending. The use of transgenic foodstuffs as immunogens against enteric pathogens is in its infancy but shows great potential. These vaccines could be produced inexpensively and in bulk for use in developing areas and thus have significant impact on pediatric diarrheal disease.",
