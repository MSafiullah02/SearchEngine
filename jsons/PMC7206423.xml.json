The first case was recorded on February 18, 2020, and since then the exponential growth has greatly increased surpassing the China cases (81,669 cases). In Italy, according to worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/), a website tracking COVID-19 cases, the total number of positive COVID cases are 124,632 with 15,362 deaths and 20,996 recovered patients (effective date as of April 5, 2020). In a short time, Italy has been surpassed by Spain, which has the second-highest number of COVID cases (130,759 with 12,418 deaths), and the USA, which holds the dramatic record of infected cases (311,637 with 9,454 death). However, the reason why the number of deaths in Italy is so high compared with other countries is still unknown. One factor may be the age of its population because Italy has the oldest population in Europe, with approximately 23% of residents 65 or older. However, some concerns have been raised regarding the different testing strategies, thus accounting for dissimilarities among the counties.2\n",

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, though found almost exclusively within the respiratory epithelium, is also seen in the renal tubular cells, hepatic cholangiocytes, and cardiocytes.3 This could account for the multiorgan involvement in high-risk patients with COVID. A study from China identified that almost 85.5% of patients had evidence of extrapulmonary disease with cardiac involvement seen in almost 74% of these cohort groups.4 The characteristic computed tomography chest scan findings include bilateral ground-glass opacities, whereas the hyaline membrane and interstitial thickening are the pathognomonic histologic changes identified in the disease.5\n",

Neurosurgery also has been left crippled by this pandemic. Most of the elective surgeries have already been canceled. Although the incidence of road traffic accidents might have decreased, owing to the lockdown, the neurosurgeons still need to plan emergent care for patients with cardiovascular accidents, acute hydrocephalus, and tumors with impending herniation. Moreover, all of their patients are at risk for finding available beds in intensive care units, and for those in the intensive rehabilitation unit, the discharge from hospital is almost difficult. The study from Italy has provided a framework for creating an emergency task force and creating focused treatment hubs.9 They have implemented transfer of needful patients into these hubs either primarily or through secondary transport from the peripheral spokes. Most of the urgent neurosurgical procedures can be performed by a strict number of operators. The clinical situations defined as neurosurgical emergencies are cerebral hemorrhage, acute hydrocephalus, brain tumor with a forthcoming risk of intracranial hypertension, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, and spinal cord compression.9 Also, a direct neurosurgical involvement in the management of infected patients cannot be excluded because of the recent evidence of acute brain hemorrhage observed in patients with COVID-19.10\n",
