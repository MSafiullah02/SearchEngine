Increases in urbanization, the process of people living together in towns and cities rather than rural areas, result in denser populations that are subsequently more prone to spreading infectious diseases. This is particularly true in overcrowded urban centers and those that lack adequate sanitary conditions and clean water supplies. Globalization is the expansion of economies, populations, and businesses to areas throughout the world. Globalization has facilitated the ability of infectious diseases to spread rapidly between countries through trade and travel. Increased trade between countries can promote the spread of infectious diseases, particularly those found in food or animal products. Illegal activities, such as the trade of bushmeat, also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases. As an example, the U.S. Geological Survey found that bushmeat that had been confiscated at US borders contained novel herpesviruses and retroviruses. The illegal trade of bushmeat is extensive, providing an avenue for zoonoses to be transferred to the human population. In fact, the HIV pandemic may have begun with the acquisition of bushmeat contaminated with simian immunodeficiency viruses.",

A person traveling from one country to another can spread infectious diseases in this way, as occurred in the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was characterized by severe lower respiratory symptoms, pneumonia, and fever. SARS was later determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus, named SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In this case, the virus initially appeared in November of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, and was spread by travelers within weeks to over 30 countries in Europe, North America, and other areas of China and Asia. In total, 8098 people were infected, and 774 (9.6%) died. In Guangdong Province markets, the virus was isolated from palm civets, a meat- and fruit-eating mammal with a cat-like appearance that was sold for meat. SARS-CoV was also isolated from civet meat from a restaurant that employed a worker that had contracted SARS. Although the palm civets were the most likely source of SARS-CoV in this outbreak, much higher rates of SARS-CoV were found in palm civets from local markets as compared to palm civets on distant farms. This suggested that the palm civets themselves may have contracted SARS-CoV from another animal source while in the market. The virus has also been identified in horseshoe bats, the likely natural reservoir of this zoonosis.",

The consequences of urbanization and globalization\u2014including but not limited to deforestation, habitat modification, and the use of wild land for farming\u2014impact the emergence and reemergence of potential zoonoses. Increases in the human population have led to the encroachment of humans into animal habitats formerly unoccupied by humans. These circumstances contribute to humans coming in contact with animals with which they would not normally interact, putting them at risk of being exposed to zoonotic viruses that are found in the local wildlife populations. The transfer of zoonotic viruses to humans can occur directly or indirectly. For example, during an outbreak of 276 cases of Nipah virus in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998\u201399, most infected individuals had contact with sick pigs that were being farmed commercially as livestock and then slaughtered for meat. The pigs contracted Nipah virus from the local bats, which were thought to have spread the virus through urine or by dropping partially eaten fruit, laden with bat saliva, into the pig stalls. The bats may have acquired the fruit from the fruit trees on the farms. Human infection with Nipah virus causes encephalitis, fever, headache, and reduced consciousness. Forty percent of infected individuals died during this outbreak. Interestingly, Nipah virus infection is asymptomatic in bats.",

It is highly contagious, and infection leads to a severe illness that lasts about a week. Infection can cause serious complications, including deafness, encephalitis, blindness, seizures, and pneumonia. Death occurs in 2\u20133 of every 1000 infected individuals. Worldwide, 20 million people are infected annually, causing over 145,000 deaths each year. It is one of the leading causes of death in young children.Measles is not a newly emerging disease. The first documentation of infection dates back to the year AD 900 in an account written by a Persian doctor trying to distinguish measles from smallpox. It remains endemic in certain areas of the world, including portions of Europe and Africa. However, vaccination has proven effective in reducing cases of measles and its complications. For example, in the United States, three to four million people contracted measles each year before the vaccine program was initiated in 1963. These infections caused 400\u2013500 deaths, 48,000 hospitalizations, and 4000 cases of encephalitis annually. In 2000, the United States declared that measles had been eliminated from the country, attributable to strong vaccination campaigns.Unfortunately, measles has been making a comeback in the US in the past decade, imported from foreign countries or from unvaccinated individuals that have visited these countries. Unlike previous occasions when the virus did not meet many susceptible hosts, measles has recently been able to spread locally in the United States because of pockets of individuals that have refused vaccination. Although the vaccine is 97% effective, a small percentage of previously vaccinated individuals have also contracted the disease, further emphasizing the importance of high vaccination rates.Several large outbreaks have occurred from 2008 to the present (Fig. 16.3C). 2014 saw 668 cases of measles in the United States, the largest number observed since 2000 and more cases than occurred in 1996. As of September 18, 2015, 189 measles cases have occurred in the United States during 2015. Most of these (117) were associated with an outbreak at two Disney theme parks in California. Among 110 infected California residents, 45% were unvaccinated. Twelve were too young to receive the vaccine, but 76% of the unvaccinated individuals declined vaccination due to personal beliefs. The uptick of measles in the United States and other countries in which the virus was previous eradicated emphasize the importance of the measles vaccine and efforts to maintain high immunization rates.\nwas through the ingestion of fresh date palm sap, which is harvested from date palm trees much in the same way that maple sap is tapped from maple trees to produce maple syrup. Local bat species also visit the pots of date palm sap and lick the sweet sap as it is being collected, thereby contaminating the sap with virus-containing saliva and providing a route of exposure to humans that drink it. Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus also occurred after the virus entered the human population.",

As a consequence, rodent exposure to humans is increased, concurrent with the frequency of rodentborne viruses. This occurred in the emergence of the Sin Nombre virus, a hantavirus that causes a potentially deadly respiratory syndrome, in the Four Corners region of the Southwestern United States. Preceded by six years of drought, the 1993 spring season was characterized by extremely heavy rains (as a result of an El Ni\u00f1o) that increased 10-fold the population of deer mice (Fig. 16.4A\n).

These include mean temperature, wind speed, dew point, soil moisture, and rain accumulation, among others. Long-term increases in global temperature due to climate change also affect the emergence/reemergence of viral diseases. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the combined land and ocean surface temperature in 2014 was 1.24\u00b0F above the 20th century average, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred within the past 20 years. Warmer winter weather allows female mosquitoes to more easily overwinter, surviving to the spring. Warmer daily temperatures in an area also expand the habitat for certain mosquito populations, concurrently expanding the populations that can be infected by the viruses they carry. In the United States, mosquito populations in tropical and subtropical Florida support local infections of DENV and Chikungunya virus, the latter of which first emerged in Florida in 2014. As average temperatures increase in states, so will the frequency of zoonotic viruses into states whose climate did not previously support these mosquito species. Similarly, climate changes affect the distribution of ticks and the migratory routes of birds and other animals, changing the locations that are exposed to the zoonoses they carry.

For example, Japanese encephalitis virus normally circulates between mosquitoes and birds but can be amplified in pigs, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus has an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and rodents but is capable of initiating a rural epizootic cycle in horses. Both of these transmission cycles can result in tangential infection of humans if infected by the arthropod vector. On the other hand, an urban cycle involves the direct transmission of the virus between mosquitoes and humans. In this case, the viremia that occurs upon human infection is sufficiently large to transmit the virus when the person is bitten by the mosquito. Urban cycles occur with yellow fever virus and DENV, although both of these viruses possess enzootic transmission cycles as well. Intermediate cycles are also possible in which vectors transmit the virus back and forth between human and nonhuman hosts.",

Within Flaviviridae, the Flavivirus genus contains over 50 different species, the majority of which are transmitted by vectors. It includes several notable human pathogens, including yellow fever virus, DENV, Japanese encephalitis virus, WNV, and St. Louis encephalitis virus (see Table 16.2). DENV is currently the most common arboviral disease in the world, infecting around 400 million individuals and causing over 12,000 deaths each year. Dengue-like epidemics have been recorded in tropical areas of the world since the 1600s, and the virus was first isolated in 1943\u201344 by Albert Sabin and others from soldiers in the Pacific and Asia during World War II. DENV is considered a reemerging virus due to the expansion of the domesticated Aedes aegypti mosquito (Fig. 16.6A\n), the primary vector, and Aedes albopictus, a lesser vector for DENV. The spread of these mosquito species is attributable to the factors mentioned above. Currently, the mosquito species live mainly between the 35\u00b0S and 35\u00b0N latitudes and below 3200 feet in areas where the evening temperature does not fall below 50\u00b0F (Fig. 16.6B and C). They are associated with human-populated areas and cities, and as such, DENV is communicated primarily via an urban transmission cycle.",

Patients with fatal disease die of these conditions typically between day 6 and 16 after the onset of symptoms. In the 2014\u201315 outbreak in West Africa, the average was 7.5 days. Individuals that survive typically improve around day 6 and are thought to cease being infectious when virus is no longer detectable in the bloodstream or in urine. Interestingly, EBOV has been found in the semen of men that have recovered from EVD long after virus was undetectable in other fluids.\nCase Study: Chikungunya Fever Diagnosed Among International Travelers\u2014United States, 2005\u201306\nExcerpted from Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, September 29, 2006/55(38);1040\u20131042.Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus indigenous to tropical Africa and Asia, where it is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, usually of the genus Aedes. Chikungunya (CHIK) fever, the disease caused by CHIKV, was first recognized in epidemic form in East Africa during 1952\u201353. The word \u201cchikungunya\u201d is thought to derive from description in local dialect of the contorted posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with this disease. Because CHIK fever epidemics are sustained by human\u2013mosquito\u2013human transmission, the epidemic cycle is similar to those of dengue and urban yellow fever. During 2005\u201306, 12 cases of CHIK fever were diagnosed serologically and virologically at CDC in travelers who arrived in the United States from areas known to be epidemic or endemic for CHIK fever. This report describes four of these cases.Case Reports\nMinnesota. On May 12, 2005, an adult male resident of Minnesota returned from a 3-month trip to Somalia and Kenya. He had onset of illness hours after arrival in the United States, including fever, headache, malaise, and joint pain mainly in a shoulder and a knee. Serum obtained on May 13 was tested at CDC and determined to be equivocal for CHIKV RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), consistent with low-level viremia. A recent CHIKV infection was confirmed by demonstration of IgM antibody in this acute-phase serum specimen and neutralizing antibody in convalescent-phase serum (collected 214 days after illness onset). Arthralgias resolved after several weeks.\nLouisiana. On January 15, 2006, an adult female resident of India had onset of an illness characterized by fever, joint pain (in the knees, wrists, hands, and feet), and muscle pain (in the thighs and neck). In March 2006, she traveled to Louisiana, where she sought medical attention for persistent joint pain. At CDC, tests of a single serum sample collected on March 30 (74 days after illness onset) were positive for IgM and neutralizing antibodies to CHIKV.\nMaryland. An adult female resident of Maryland visited the island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean from October 2005 through mid-March 2006. On February 18, 2006, during an ongoing CHIK fever outbreak in the island, she had onset of fever, joint pain (in the hands and feet), and rash. A local physician clinically diagnosed CHIK fever, but no laboratory tests were conducted. After returning to the United States, the patient sought medical attention for persistent joint pain. At CDC, tests of a single serum sample collected on March 22 (32 days after illness onset) were equivocal for IgM and positive for neutralizing antibody to CHIKV, consistent with a recent CHIKV infection in which IgM antibody was waning. At 5 months after onset, the patient had persistent joint pain (in the hands and feet).\nColorado. An adult male resident of Colorado visited Zimbabwe during April 17\u2013May 29, 2006. On April 29, he had onset of illness with fever, chills, joint pain (in the wrists and ankles), and neck stiffness; a rash appeared a few days later. All symptoms resolved within 2 weeks, except for joint pain, which persisted for approximately 1 month. At CDC, tests of a single serum sample collected on June 12 (44 days after illness onset) were positive for IgM and neutralizing antibody to CHIKV.\nReported by: E Warner, Denver, Colorado.

            "text": "\nSection 16.1 Factors Involved in the Emergence of Viral Infectious Diseases\u2022An emerging infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen that has not before been observed within a population or geographic location.\u2022A reemerging infectious disease is caused by an established pathogen that appears in a new geographical location or was once controlled but begins appearing at a higher incidence.\u202275% of emerging/reemerging diseases are zoonoses, infectious diseases of animals that can be transmitted to humans. Most zoonoses are transmitted by wildlife or arthropod vectors.\u2022Many human factors are involved in the emergence of infectious diseases. These include urbanization, globalization, travel advances that allow global travel, inadequate public health-care systems, and human behaviors that facilitate transmission. The susceptibility of the human host is also a factor in viral emergence.\u2022Nearly every emerging viral disease is associated with an environmental/ecological component. The encroachment of humans into pristine environments for farming or land modification puts them in contact with new wildlife and the viruses they carry. Weather and climate, including human-induced changes, also play a role in the emergence of viruses from their natural reservoirs.\u2022The molecular make-up of the virus determines whether or not an emerging virus will successfully infect and spread within a population. Reassortment of genetic segments, such as with influenza virus, can lead to antigenic shift and the emergence of a novel human virus. Recombination and mutation are two other means of acquiring genetic change.\u2022RNA viruses are the most common cause of emerging diseases in humans, attributable to the high mutation rate resulting from the low fidelity of their RNA polymerases.\n",

            "text": "\nSection 16.2 Notable Emerging and Reemerging Viral Diseases\u2022The great majority of emerging viral diseases are zoonoses transmitted by arthropods or nonhuman mammals.\u2022Arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted to humans or other mammals by arthropods, primarily mosquitoes and ticks. The virus is acquired when the arthropod takes a blood meal that contains the virus, which then replicates within the arthropod and is transmitted within infectious saliva to a new host.\u2022Arboviruses can be transmitted through several transmission models. The virus cycles between the arthropod vector and a wild animal in the enzootic cycle. In the rural epizootic cycle, the virus causes an epidemic within domestic animals when they are infected by the vector. An urban cycle involves the direct transmission of the virus between mosquitoes and humans.\u2022Flaviviruses include several notable vector-transmitted human pathogens, including yellow fever virus, WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and dengue virus, the most common arboviral disease in the world.\u2022Dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, whose range has been increasing due to climate change. Three-quarters of dengue infections are asymptomatic, but dengue virus can cause dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue, a serious condition characterized by hemorrhagic fever leading to shock and multiorgan failure.\u2022\nRodentia (rodents) and Chiroptera (bats) are the two most species-rich orders, and both are host to high-impact zoonotic viruses. Arenaviruses are transmitted by infected rodent urine and feces, and several can lead to hemorrhagic fever.\u2022Bats are thought to be the natural reservoir of Filoviruses, enveloped helical \u2013ssRNA viruses that are capable of causing hemorrhagic fever. Marburg virus and ebolaviruses are filoviruses. Five species of ebolaviruses have been identified, four of which infect humans and cause high mortality rates.\u2022Until the 2014\u201315 EBOV epidemic in West Africa, all ebolavirus outbreaks (with the exception of a researcher infected with TAFV) had occurred in Central Africa.\u2022The 2014\u201315 West African EBOV outbreak is thought to have originated with the infection of a 2-year-old boy in Meliandou, Guinea, by a spillover event from an insectivorous free-tailed bat. The virus quickly spread to the capital of Conakry and nearby countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali.\u2022The 2014\u201315 EBOV outbreak was declared over in January 2016. In total, 28,639 cases were documented, accounting for 11,316 deaths (39.5%).\u2022EBOV is spread from person to person through direct contact of broken skin or mucous membranes with infectious blood or bodily fluids or from contaminated syringes. The incubation period averages 8\u201312 days, at which point a person develops symptoms and is infectious. EVD begins with the sudden onset of fever, fatigue, chills, myalgia, headache, and loss of appetite. After about 5 days, this is followed by vomiting, severe watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Internal and external bleeding occurs in about a fifth of patients.\n\u2022No antivirals or vaccine exists for EVD. Treatment is supportive in an attempt to prevent dehydration, multiorgan failure, shock, hemorrhages, and other complications. Patients with fatal disease die of these conditions typically between day 6 and 16 after the onset of symptoms.\n",
