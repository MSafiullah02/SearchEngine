Among the three genera of influenza viruses (A, B, and C), influenza A and C viruses infect humans as well as other species, while influenza B virus mainly infects humans. The most common and serious infections of humans are caused by influenza A virus. Influenza A viruses are further divided into subtypes based on their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes, which encode the two viral surface proteins.",

In general, influenza A virus infections are self-limiting in healthy human adults, and mainly cause life-threatening disease in the very young and in the elderly. Notwithstanding, this depends on the circulating type. Aquatic birds serve as the main reservoir of influenza A viruses and carry all of the known subtypes (H1-16, N1-9) without necessarily developing disease upon infection. The virus can adapt to other species such as poultry, pigs, horses, or humans. In humans, thus far the H1, H2, or H3, and N1 or N2 influenza viruses have established transmittable infections.",

Point mutations that cause gradual changes are referred to as antigenic drift, and allow the virus to evade protective neutralizing antibody responses induced by previous infections. Most annual epidemics are caused by antigenic drift variants. Rearrangements of the HA- or NA-encoding gene segments between viral types circulating in humans and those endemic in animals result in more dramatic changes, also called antigenic shifts, and the pandemics of 1957 with H2N2 and 1968 with H3N2 were caused by such new types of influenza virus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a pandemic is the emergence of a serious new disease caused by an agent that spreads easily among humans. WHO recommends three measures to lessen the impact of the next influenza virus pandemic: (1) increased surveillance to allow for the earliest possible warning that a human pandemic has started; (2) early intervention to stall global spread and prevent further adaptations; and (3) development of an effective pandemic vaccine.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are enveloped spherical viruses which contain eight segments of single negative-stranded RNA. Segments 1, 2, and 3 encode the transcriptase complex composed of basic polymerases (PB)2 (segment 1) and PB1 (segment 2) and acid polymerase (PA, segment 3). Segment 4 encodes the hemagglutinin (HA), which has receptor-binding activity, promotes cell fusion, and is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. Segment 5 encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) which complexes the viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid. NP is a major target for cross-reactive CD8+ T cells in mice and humans (Falk et al. 1991). Segment 6 encodes the viral neuraminidase (NA), a cell surface protein with enzymatic activity, which also provides a target for neutralizing antibodies. Drugs such as zanamivir and oseltamivir, which block the enzymatic cleavage of sialic acid residues by NA, are available and can be used to treat or prevent infections (Garman and Laver 2004). Segment 7 encodes matrix (M) protein 1 and 2. M2 has ion channel activity, which is blocked by the antiviral drug amantadine (Ison and Hayden 2001). M protein is also a target for cross-reactive CD8+ T cells in humans, while the M2 ectodomain is a target for nonneutralizing but nevertheless protective antibodies (Zhang et al. 2006). Segment 8 encodes nonstructural proteins (NS) 1 and 2.",

            "text": "The first pandemic of the twentieth century started in 1918 in the USA and then spread to Africa and Europe, first to France and then Spain, and subsequently to every part of the globe. This pandemic was caused by an H1N1 virus and is paradoxically and unfairly referred to as the Spanish Flu. The pandemic that started in March of 1918 and lasted until June of 1920 killed half a million Americans and somewhere between 50 and 100 million humans worldwide (Johnson and Mueller 2002). This virus infected nearly 50% of the population and killed 2.5% of all of those that became infected. It is estimated that 25 million people died during the first 25 weeks of the pandemic. Death rates were high in humans between the ages of 20\u201340, an age group which generally recovers easily from influenza A virus infection. During the initial stages of the pandemic, the early symptoms of infection, which included hemorrhages and lung edema followed by death within 24\u201348 h, were commonly misdiagnosed. The severity of the symptoms is assumed to have been caused by an excessive release of cytokines in response to the virus (Kash et al. 2004), which was most severe in healthy adults with sturdy immune systems. The 1918 H1N1 virus was recently isolated from victims preserved in permafrost, and upon sequencing the virus was rederived through genetic engineering (Tumpey et al. 2005). This allowed for an extensive characterization of the virus using modern tools of science. The 1918 H1N1 virus has several distinct features that may explain its unique virulence. Most types of influenza A virus require trypsin-like enzymes for cleavage of the viral HA, which in turn restricts their cellular tropism. The NA of the H1N1 virus of 1918 can directly or indirectly cleave HA, thus rendering this virus independent of trypsin-like enzymes (Steinhauer 1999). Increased virulence was further enabled by NS proteins, which allow the virus to disable the interferon (IFN) pathway (Seo et al. 2004), a crucial component of both innate and adaptive immunity. Human-to-human transmission, a prerequisite for a human pandemic, appears to have involved a switch in preferential binding of the HA protein from \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid found in the avian enteric tract to \u03b1 -2,6 sialic acid present in the human respiratory tract (Tumpey et al. 2007). This altered receptor binding activity can be achieved experimentally through a single amino acid exchange at position 190 of the HA of the 1918 H1N1 subtype. Additional changes in the viral PB and PB2 proteins, which contain four amino acids that are conserved in human viruses and that differ from those prevalent in avians, are likely to have affected transmission between humans (Russell and Webster 2005).",

During this year, a total of 18 human cases were reported from Hong Kong, of which six were fatal. The virus rapidly caused pneumonia and multiple organ failure in infected individuals, which were mainly young adults. Culling of infected flocks of poultry initially appeared to have stopped further spread, but then in 2003 additional human cases with a similar H5N1 virus were recorded in Vietnam (Tran et al. 2004). As of January of 2008, 349 human cases of H5N1 virus infection with 216 deaths have been reported from Asia, Eurasia, and North Africa.15 Most cases occurred in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Egypt. Highly pathogenic H5N1 virus was also isolated from poultry and wild birds in Europe, including the United Kingdom. Thus far, the virus has been transmitted by human contact with infected birds, and only a few isolated cases were suggestive of direct human-to-human transmission. Further mutations of H5N1 virus, either in the form of adaptive point mutations (i.e., antigenic shift) or through reassortment in humans concomitantly infected with a different influenza A virus, could eventually allow for sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Control measures have focused on culling of infected flocks of domestic birds and restriction of poultry trade between countries. Some countries implemented vaccination programs for poultry (Steel et al. 2008; Cristalli and Capua 2007). Other countries rejected the idea of bird vaccination due to fears that this may mask infections and allow for further mutations that may promote human transmissibility.",

Such changes include resistance to the antiviral drug amantadine due to a M2 mutation first reported in 2004 from Thailand (Cheung et al. 2006). The virus has become more lethal for humans and mice, and has gained robustness against destruction in the environment. The virus has increased its host range and has been shown to cause disease in felines such as tigers (Keawcharoen et al. 2004), which are otherwise resistant to influenza A virus infections.",

            "text": "More than 90% of deaths during seasonal influenza virus outbreaks occur in the elderly (\u226565 years of age). Immunosenescence during aging leads to impaired immune responses, which increases the susceptibility of the aged to infectious agents. The elderly are affected by primary immunological changes, which are part of the natural aging process, and secondary immunological changes caused by underlying diseases and unhealthy life styles (Malaguarnera et al. 2001). Primary changes of the immune system in healthy elderly involve mainly T cells, though changes in natural killer (NK) cells and NK T cell function with age have been noted (Ginaldi et al. 1999c; Solana and Mariani 2000). T cells show clonal senescence, their potential for expansion is decreased, and their ability to produce certain cytokines and to respond to cytokines decreases. The proportion of T cells with a memory cell phenotype increases while numbers of na\u00efve T cells decrease. Stimulation with new antigens appears to result in shortened immunological memory (Ginaldi et al. 1999b). The T cell repertoire loses diversity (Effros et al. 2003) due to chronic antigenic stimulation, leading to continued clonal expansion of some T cells, which undermines the homeostatic balance of the immune system. Primary B cell responses in the elderly are commonly low and short-lived, resulting in antibodies with low affinity (Ginaldi et al. 1999a). Formation of germinal centers is decreased, antigen transport is impaired, and follicular dendritic cells show atrophy and their capacity to form antigen depots is reduced (Zheng et al. 1997; Aydar et al. 2004). Autoantibodies are more common and the B cell repertoire becomes more restricted. Many of these changes reflect secondary effects due to an age-related decline of helper functions from CD4+ T cells, which show reduced expression of critical costimulatory receptors that are essential for activation of B cells, germinal center formation and rearrangement, and hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes. Underlying chronic diseases dramatically increase the risk of serious complications of an influenza virus infection. Patients with one or two chronic diseases have 40- or 150-fold (respectively) greater risk for developing pneumonia upon influenza virus infection (Janssens and Krause 2004; Stott et al. 2001). Underlying chronic heart, lung, or liver diseases increase the risk of serious influenza virus infection in all age groups, not just the elderly.",

Viral clearance following a primary infection is mediated in part by CD8+ T cells and in part by antibodies, which in turn require the activity of CD4+ T helper cells for their induction. Lack of CD4+ T cells does not affect induction of a primary CD8+ T cell response to influenza A virus (Yap and Ada 1978; Mozdzanowska et al. 2005), although absence of CD4+ T cells in general reduces the magnitude of the memory CD8+ T cell pool and the CD8+ T cell recall response. Neither IFN-\u03b3 nor IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 appear to be essential for viral clearance (Price et al. 2000), although loss of both IFN pathways has been reported to exacerbate disease. Perforin is essential for viral clearance, and mice lacking perforin show delayed viral clearance and increased mortality to influenza A virus infection (Topham et al. 1997). Increased mortality was also observed in IL-1 receptor knockout mice (Szretter et al. 2007); these mice developed normal CD8+ T cell responses and viral titers were only modestly above those of normal mice. IL-1 receptor knockout mice showed a defect in recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection, most notably neutrophils and CD4+ T cells.",

Some mouse studies showed that adaptive transfer of neutralizing secretory IgA protected the animals, while transfer of neutralizing antibodies of the IgG isotype was inefficient (Renegar and Small 1991). Other mouse studies showed that protection by H5-specific IgG1 monoclonal antibodies can be achieved against H5N1 infections (Hanson et al. 2006). Yet others reported protection by IgG antibodies that bound HA but failed to neutralize the virus (McLain and Dimmock 1989). One monoclonal neutralizing antibody was described that cross-reacted between H1 and H2 and consequently protected animals upon passive transfer against infection with either virus (Okuno et al. 1994). In other virus infections, such as those with rabies virus, where neutralizing antibodies are known to play a dominant role in protection against infection and disease, protective titers of neutralizing antibodies have been defined. For rabies virus, a titer of or above 0.5 international units protects against challenge; this knowledge has greatly facilitated vaccination efforts. In contrast, it is still not known what titer of influenza A virus-neutralizing antibodies reliably provides protection against disease. In general, it is assumed that titers above 1:40 are protective, although numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that humans with lower titers were protected while others with higher titers developed symptomatic infections.",

As already mentioned above, some neutralizing antibodies can cross-neutralize several subtypes of influenza A virus. Nonneutralizing antibodies to the ectodomain of matrix protein (M2e) can protect against heterotypic challenge in animal models (Mozdzanowska et al. 2003). The 23 amino acid (aa) long M2e is conserved in its nine N-terminal amino acids and shows relative minor variability in the remaining sequences. This is likely to reflect a lack of selective pressure, as natural infections or traditional vaccines induce only low antibody responses to M2e (Feng et al. 2006). The currently circulating avian H5N1 and H7N2 subtypes show sequence variability with previous human isolates that affect M2e antibody-binding sites. For example, they show changes in amino acids at positions 10\u201316 of M2e (H5N1: PIRNEWG to PTRNGWG, or PTRNEWE) (Liu et al. 2005).",

Ada showed that adoptive transfer of influenza virus immune cells provided protection against challenge with a heterotypic subtype of the virus (Yap and Ada 1978). These studies were confirmed by R. Dutton and colleagues, who studied the efficacy of passively transferred, in vitro activated CD8+ T cells isolated from mice transgenic (tg) for a T cell receptor (TcR) to the influenza A virus HA (Cerwenka et al. 1999). Transfer of na\u00efve TcR-tg CD8+ T cells failed to provide resistance to challenge. Protection against a lethal infection could be provided by the transfer of rested memory-like or effector TcR-tg CD8+ T cells, although the latter effected more rapid viral clearance, which may indicate that the rested CD8+ T cells needed to expand before they assumed effector functions. Protection was only mediated by CD8+ T cells that were able to home to the infected respiratory tissues. Poxvirus vectors expressing the influenza A virus NP, which induce a CD8+ T cell response (Andrew et al. 1986), were shown to induce some protection against heterotypic challenge (Endo et al. 1991; Altstein et al. 2006). Further studies showed that although vaccinia virus vectors expressing the influenza virus NP induced only limited protection in mice, adoptive transfer of T cells isolated from NP-immune mice and expanded in vitro were highly effective (Mbawuike et al. 2007). Yet another group reported that a vaccinia virus vector which expressed a sequence of NP that induced a sturdy CD8+ T cell response in mice, including in their lungs, completely failed to induce protective immunity as assessed by peak viral loads, morbidity or mortality (Lawson et al. 1994).",

Another group reported that protection upon intranasal immunization with an adjuvanted nucleoprotein vaccine was mediated by T helper cells of the Th1 type rather than by CD8+ T cells (Tamura et al. 1996). Yet another group reported protection with an adenovirus vector expressing nucleoprotein (Roy et al. 2007). In our hands, subunit vaccines expressing the nucleoprotein induced strong CD8+ T cell responses that could readily be detected in spleen, blood, or even lungs of vaccinated mice. Nevertheless, vaccinated mice were not reliably protected against disease or death following challenge with influenza A virus (unpublished). Overall T cell protection studies largely agree that adoptive transfer of in vitro expanded CD8+ T cells provides protection against influenza virus. Results on the protective nature of in situ activated influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells range from solid protection to complete absence of protection, even under circumstances where high numbers of influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells were present in the airways at the time of challenge. The lack of consistency of protection through CD8+ T cells may reflect genetic differences in the mouse strain used for the experiments, differences in the dose or type of challenge virus, differences in the interval between vaccination and challenge, and/or differences in the functionality of CD8+ T cells induced by various approaches.",

Protection through M2e-expressing vaccines is mediated by humoral immunity and can be achieved by passive transfer of monoclonal M2e-specific antibodies prior to virus challenge (Mozdzanowska et al. 2003). One vaccine developed by W. Gerhard and colleagues was based on an M2e peptide linked to universal T helper cell epitopes. Others developed M2e vaccines based on papilloma virus-like particles (Ginaldi et al. 1999a), or fusion proteins linking M2e to hepatitis B virus core protein (De Filette et al. 2006). All of these subunit vaccines elicited antibodies to M2e in animals that protected against subsequent challenge with different types of influenza A virus, and the M2e-hepatitis B virus core fusion protein vaccine has now entered a phase I trial (EurekAlert 2007). The immunogenicity of an M2e vaccine could be increased by adjuvants such as Toll-like receptor 5 ligands (Huleatt et al. 2008). In one study, passively immunized animals were challenged with influenza A viruses that were identical or that differed in their M2e sequence; animals were protected against viruses that expressed the same M2e sequence but not against subtypes with M2e variants, (Fan et al. 2004). Several M2e sequences corresponding to the H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 influenza subtypes were formulated using a liposome-based vaccine technology and evaluated as potential immunogens for the development of a \u201cuniversal\u201d influenza vaccine. Mice immunized with the polyvalent liposomal M2e survived challenges with different subtypes of influenza virus, and antiserum from immunized mice provided passive protection to na\u00efve mice (Ernst et al. 2006). One study on a DNA vaccine expressing M2e fused to the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus reported increased mortality in vaccinated pigs, indicating that a poorly immunogenic vaccine (and DNA vaccines are commonly poorly immunogenic, especially in larger species) may exacerbate influenza virus-associated pathology (Heinen et al. 2002). In most studies, vaccines expressed one sequence of M2e. Notwithstanding, although M2e is far less variable than HA, it is not completely conserved, and mutants such as those present in recent H5N1 variants have been observed, suggesting that a universal M2e-based vaccine for influenza A virus should incorporate several common variants of M2e, including those that are present in the currently circulating pathogenic H5N1 viruses (Aydar et al. 2004). M2e vaccines induce some protective immunity, although this protection wanes against high challenge doses of virulent virus. M2e vaccines thus need to be optimized further, either through the use of novel adjuvants, or by their incorporation into more immunogenic vaccine carriers. Once this is achieved, M2e vaccines may well become part of an ideal universal vaccine for influenza virus, alleviating the need for a pandemic vaccine.",

The highly virulent H5N1 viruses rapidly kill embryonated chicken eggs, which are used to propagate the influenza A viruses for the annual vaccines. A number of manufacturers thus started to develop cell culture systems based for example on Vero or MDCK cells to propagate H5N1 influenza virus. Cell-grown influenza virus vaccines were tested in humans and showed immunogenicity and safety profiles that were comparable to those of egg-grown vaccines (Halperin et al. 2002). Others used reverse genetics to develop reassortant viruses in which gene segments encoding HA and NA were derived from highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, and all other genes were derived from the H1N1 virus A/PR/8/34, which was isolated in Puerto Rico in 1934 and is commonly used in animal studies (Lipatov et al. 2005b; Subbarao et al. 2003). The HA gene was further modified to replace the stretch of six basic amino acids at the cleavage site that can be digested by furin (Shi et al. 2007), and the resulting virus is avirulent in chickens and can be grown readily in eggs.",

These vaccines achieved protection in mice, ferrets, or birds against pathogenic subtypes of influenza A virus expressing the same or a closely related HA through the induction of neutralizing antibodies. In a human clinical trial with an inactivated H5N1 influenza virus vaccine attenuated through reverse genetics and changes of the HA cleavage site to allow propagation in eggs, protective titers of neutralizing Abs could be induced in volunteers after two doses of the vaccine (Treanor et al. 2006). Unfortunately, the dose that was needed to induce immune responses was six times that used for current influenza A virus vaccines. In a subsequent larger trial, the vaccine was adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, which did not improve the vaccine\u2019s immunogenicity (Bresson et al. 2006). Others reported the opposite results (Leroux-Roels et al. 2007). Additional clinical trials were conducted with inactivated whole-virus vaccine, which caused seroconversion in \u223c80% of vaccines that received the highest vaccine dose (10 mg), again indicating that the HA of H5N1 viruses is not a potent inducer of neutralizing antibody responses (Lin et al. 2006). The immunogenicity of H5N1 vaccine could be increased by adding MF59 adjuvant (Nicholson et al. 2001). Clinical trials have also been initiated with an attenuated H5N1 vaccine.15\n",

DNA vaccine priming followed by a booster immunization with a replication-defective vector of adenovirus of the human serotype 5 (AdHu5), both expressing NP, augmented specific T cell responses and provided superior protection against challenge (Epstein et al. 2005). Two groups explored AdHu5 vectors expressing H5; they were shown to induce B and T cell responses against HA which protected against challenge with a pathogenic H5N1 virus (Gao et al. 2006; Hoelscher et al. 2006). Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that seroprevalence rates of neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5 are high in humans, especially those living in Asia or Africa, and that such antibodies strongly dampen antibody responses to the transgene product expressed by an AdHu5 vector. Fowl pox vectors (Qiao et al. 2006) and alpha virus replicons (Schultz-Cherry et al. 2000) expressing H5 were also shown to induce protective immunity against H5N1 influenza viruses.",

Initiating widespread vaccination before the actual pandemic starts would thus raise ethical questions\u2014any vaccine, even one that is well tolerated, carries risks for the recipients. Without any clear indication that H5N1 is turning into a pandemic virus, the risk of vaccination would surpass the benefit to the vaccinated individual. This was demonstrated during the swine flu vaccine debacle of 1976, when vaccination against a virus that never spread caused a serious, crippling disease in hundreds of recipients. In addition to causing harm to these unfortunate individuals, this incident continues to provide ammunition to the vocal community of vaccine opponents that seem to have forgotten the haunting images of humans disfigured by poxviruses or wards full of polio virus-infected children on iron lungs. In contrast, a universal vaccine could be given before a pandemic, as such a vaccine would prevent seasonal influenza, thus providing a tangible benefit to its recipients.",

If we take a Socratic view of the form and shape of the next pandemic influenza virus, mass production of a vaccine that induces protection through subtype-specific antibodies before a pandemic virus has actually evolved makes no sense. Making sure that an infrastructure is in place to rapidly and efficiently respond to a pandemic is, on the other hand, a prudent approach, and global agencies such as WHO in concert with governments are preparing for the next pandemic. Constant monitoring of evolving subtypes, new human infections and potential human-to-human spread in order to detect a pandemic at the earliest possible time is a vital task, and this been established. The sharing of virus isolates to identify potential vaccine candidates is important and requires international collaboration. Indonesia, which has the highest incidence of H5N1-related human deaths, initially refused to provide H5N1 samples to WHO in order to focus attention on their concern that while developing countries provide new viral isolates, any resulting vaccines produced by commercial companies would likely be used primarily in developed countries. By March 2007, Indonesia, which was the only country that took this stance, reversed its policy.",

A number of vaccine manufacturers have started to increase their production capacity, and it is expected that the current capacity will double by 2009. The long-term goal is to increase production capacity to three billion doses per year. It is also expected that manufacturing will commence in less developed countries. Idiosyncrasies of the actual pandemic vaccine, such as the required dose and the potential need for repeat injections, will determine whether this capacity will suffice. This is being addressed by attempts to increase the immunogenicity of influenza virus vaccines through novel adjuvants. Poorly growing vaccine subtypes could also offset the speed of production, and this is being tackled by developing cell-culture-based systems and through the use of reverse genetics to achieve rapid attenuation of influenza viruses. Recent studies indicated that antibodies to currently circulating viruses show some cross-reactivity with H5N1. 15These studies must be confirmed. If indeed annual vaccinations with certain types of vaccine offer some degree of heterotypic protection a broadening of seasonal influenza vaccine coverage would certainly be warranted, especially in countries that have advanced to a \u201cpandemic alert period.\u201d",

Quarantine was very successful in stopping the SARS epidemic of 2003 (Hsieh et al. 2007). The SARS virus has a longer incubation time than influenza virus, and peak virus titers are not reached until several days after the onset of symptoms. Isolating cases thus proved an effective way to prevent the further spread of SARS, but it is unlikely to work against influenza virus. WHO recommends exit screening for international travelers that leave countries that are affected by an influenza virus pandemic.
