As of 2011, approximately 1\u00b72 billion Chinese citizens (more than 95\u00b77% of the total population of 1\u00b73 billion people) are covered by one of three social health insurance programmes: the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) scheme, the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) scheme, and the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS; panel\n).7, 10 To improve fairness in health insurance coverage, the central government in China announced the decision to integrate URBMI and NRCMS into the new Urban-Rural Resident Medical Insurance (URRMI) scheme at the end of 2015.11 However, low levels of service coverage for some beneficiaries and high levels of patient cost-sharing (from out-of-pocket fees for health services) have raised concerns about the lack of adequate financial protection for patients with non-communicable diseases.10\nPanelChina's main social health insurance schemesThe China New Health System Reform, introduced in 2009, has expanded social health insurance coverage such that in 2011 95\u00b77% of the Chinese population were covered.7 Three main social health insurance schemes exist.The UEBMI scheme, which covers urban workers, was launched by the Chinese State Council in 1998. All urban employees are required to join this scheme, which consists of a pooled fund for inpatient stays and individual medical savings accounts for outpatient visits. Approximately 283 million people were enrolled in UEBMI in 2014.8 It is financed by payroll income from employees (2% of their salary) and employers (equivalent to 6% of employee's salary).9 The per-capita fund of this scheme is US$424\u00b77.10\nThe URBMI scheme aims to insure the rest of the urban population, including children, students, and other unemployed urban residents who are not covered by UEBMI. In 2014, 315 million people were covered by URBMI. The scheme is funded by a government subsidy (70%) and individual contributions (30%).9 The per-capita fund of this scheme is $66\u00b72.10\nThe NRCMS was launched in 2003 for the rural population, and expanded rapidly to cover about 802 million rural residents by 2013.10 NRCMS funds are pooled at the county level. The NRCMS is financed by the premiums of those enrolled (approximately 20%) and generous subsidies from both central and local governments (approximately 80%). Annual government subsidies per enrolee increased from \u00a520 (US$2\u00b79) in 2003 to \u00a5380 ($55\u00b72) in 2015. The per-capita funding for NRCMS is $61\u00b72.9\nChina has also established a medical assistance programme for subsistence allowance recipients, people in poverty, low-income household members, and critically-ill patients in poor families. This programme is jointly funded by the central and local governments. At the end of 2015, the Chinese Government announced the decision to integrate URBMI and NRCMS as the URRMI scheme, to achieve universal health coverage.11 This integration has enabled a further extension of funding pools and narrowing of disparities in access to health-care services and medications, which existed between different insurance schemes.UEBMI=Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance. URBMI=Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance. NRCMS=New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme. URRMI=Urban-Rural Resident Medical Insurance.",

We identified 12 articles that examined the association between multimorbidity and health-care use and expenditure in China. One study examined the association between multimorbidity and health-care use among 162 464 people in Guangdong province. However, we identified no national-level studies that used panel survey data in their analysis to examine the effect of multimorbidity on health service use and financial protection by socioeconomic group and populations covered by various social health insurance schemes in China. Research is urgently needed to generate evidence to inform health policy and health system responses to multimorbidity.\nAdded value of this study\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first longitudinal analysis to examine socioeconomic group differences in the prevalence of physical multimorbidity in China, and its effect on health-care use and catastrophic health expenditures. Our findings indicate that physical multimorbidity is common among Chinese adults aged 50 years and older. Individuals in higher socioeconomic groups have more physical multimorbidity than those in lower socioeconomic groups.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOur findings differ from the evidence from high-income countries, where the prevalence of physical multimorbidity is higher among lower-income groups than in higher-income groups, but this difference might be due to limitations in the current study data, which excluded mental health conditions and relied mainly on self-report. Further studies examining the effect of multimorbidity due to other common chronic conditions (eg, Alzheimer's disease, depression, asthma) and infectious diseases (eg, tuberculosis, AIDS, coronavirus disease 2019) are also warranted. The social patterning of multimorbidity in China requires further research that should include a wider range of morbidities, and more robust measures of both mental and physical conditions than has been recorded to date.\n",

The overall response rate to CHARLS was 80\u00b75% in the first wave. The total sample size of the CHARLS baseline survey in 2011 was 17 708 individual respondents and these participants were followed up once every 2 years to repeat the survey. The data included individual weighting variables to ensure that the survey sample was nationally representative.

However, lower educational attainment was found to be associated with slightly lower number of non-communicable diseases (IRR 0\u00b795 [95% CI 0\u00b792\u20130\u00b799] for those who completed secondary school; and IRR 0\u00b794 [0\u00b789\u20130\u00b799] for those who completed a college course, compared with those who completed primary school and below). Second, we investigated the association between number of non-communicable diseases and number of outpatient visits and inpatient hospital days (appendix p 7). The results were consistent with our main findings, showing physical multimorbidity was associated with an increase in the number of outpatient visits and inpatient hospital days. Finally, we repeated our catastrophic health expenditure analysis using the WHO and World Banks's definitions at various household expenditure thresholds. We found similar associations between physical multimorbidity and catastrophic health expenditures at different thresholds (appendix p 8).",

The likelihood of physical multimorbidity increased with older age, among women, with higher per capita household expenditure (ie, in higher socioeconomic groups), and possibly with higher educational level (although our sensitivity analysis did not support this finding).

A possible explanation for this observation is that less financial risk protection was available to people in the lowest income quartile who were enrolled in URBMI due to restricted benefits packages and a lack of coverage for some medications and inpatient services, which has probably led to a high incidence of catastrophic health expenditures. The cost of health care in urban health facilities is higher than that of rural health facilities. This difference could explain why lower socioeconomic groups covered by URBMI had a higher likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures than those covered by UEBMI. A previous study has indicated that the per-capita annual fund contribution for UEBMI was about six times higher than that for URBMI, suggesting that beneficiaries of UEBMI are likely to have smaller out-of-pocket spending than individuals enrolled in URBMI.9\n",

Further studies examining the effect of multimorbidity due to other common chronic conditions (eg, Alzheimer's disease, depression, asthma) and infectious diseases (eg, tuberculosis, AIDS, coronavirus disease 2019) are also warranted. The social patterning of multimorbidity in China requires further research that should include a wider range of morbidities, and more robust measures of both mental and physical conditions than has been recorded to date.
