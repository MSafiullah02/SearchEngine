However, identification of such models has not yet been explored in detail, and the models have not been validated by real data. In this paper, we present several different spread models from the literature and explore their relationships to each other; for one of these processes, we present a sufficient condition for asymptotic stability of the healthy equilibrium, show that the condition is necessary and sufficient for uniqueness of the healthy equilibrium, and present necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the spread parameters. Finally, we employ two real datasets, one from John Snow's seminal work on cholera epidemics in London in the 1850's and the other one from the United States Department of Agriculture, to validate an approximation of a well-studied network-dependent susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model.",

A virus model is called homogeneous if the infection and healing rates are the same for every agent, and heterogeneous if they are different for each agent. In this work, we will focus on discrete-time SIS models.",

Ignoring network structure is clearly a huge assumption and using a full probabilistic model can become very computationally expensive as the size of the network grows. For these reasons we focus on a nonlinear network-dependent ordinary differential equation model. To the best of our knowledge, no work has been done on the identification of spread parameters from data for these models. Since these are the main models studied in the controls field, validation of the models is important. Many virus spread papers using these models have claimed to use real data to test their models, but no true validation of non-trivial network-dependent SIS spread models has been done. Those papers that use real data only build the network structure using real data, but do not have real spread process data over that network. In [11] , [12] , Wan et al. compare their model to a simulator of SARS, not real data. In [2] , Chakrabarti et al. use a router network from the state of Oregon and simulate an artificial spread process over that network.",

While now, partially due to Snow, we understand cholera, how it spreads, and how to mitigate it, it is still a serious problem in poorer parts of the world today.

In Section III, we analyze one of the discretetime spread processes from Section II that has not been explored in detail. In Section IV, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for learning, or identifying, the spread process parameters of the same model, from data produced by the models. In so doing, we establish several assumptions that need to be met by the USDA data. In Section V, we validate the results from Section IV via simulation. In Section VI, we introduce Dr. Snow's seminal cholera dataset from 1854 and use it to validate the spread model. In Section VII, we introduce the USDA dataset and the associated subsidy programs, and we learn the homogeneous spread parameters of the ACRE program using data from one part of the country and verify the learned parameters by simulating the spread model over the complete contiguous United States and comparing the simulated data with the actual data. We conclude with some discussion of the results and future work in Section VIII.",

Snow created this map to illustrate to officials that the cholera epidemic was being spread by infected water from the Broad Street pump, and not through the air, as was the common belief of those times. We have plotted this data in Figure 4 , with diamonds indicating a water pump and red dots indicating deaths. Snow also documented the cumulative deaths per day in Table I of [13] , plotted in Figure 5 . The time of deaths for each address is not recorded. Note that the total cumulative deaths is 616, but the total number of deaths on the map are 489. Therefore, there is a discrepancy of 127 deaths, whose household addresses are not included in the map.",

The dataset allows for the possibility to investigate the spread of the ACRE program through several different networks. Farmer-to-farmer networks could be created from the data by connecting farmer-nodes who receive payments on the same field or live nearby. Alternatively, farms can be aggregated to the county level. This approach allows us to convert the binary decision to enroll in ACRE into a continuous measure of the proportion of eligible farms that enroll in ACRE in each county. The proportion of farms enrolled in ACRE corresponds exactly to the density of infection, facilitating our investigation of the spread of ACRE.
