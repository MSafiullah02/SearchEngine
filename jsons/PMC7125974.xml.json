            "text": "Pandemic influenza A 2009 H1N1 was the predominant virus worldwide in the 2009\u20132010 influenza season and has claimed thousands of lives since 2009 (WHO, 2010a). 2009 H1N1 is generally resistant to adamantanes, leaving neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors as the only drug class available for antiviral therapy (Deyde and Gubareva, 2009, Deyde et al., 2010). Oseltamivir is the most widely used NA inhibitor for the treatment of influenza A and 2009 H1N1 (Deyde et al., 2010). However, resistant influenza A variants have spread worldwide during the 2008\u20132009 season (Sheu et al., 2011, WHO (World Health Organization), 2009), and increased oseltamivir use during the 2009\u20132010 pandemic season raised concerns that resistant 2009 H1N1 variants may emerge. Indeed, more than 300 resistant cases have been reported worldwide (CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), 2009, Wang et al., 2010, WHO (World Health Organization), 2010b), including resistant isolates detected in low oseltamivir-usage regions (Hurt et al., 2011a). Oseltamivir resistance is associated with mutation on NA type 1 at residues impacting the catalytic site (Maurer-Stroh et al., 2009). H275Y (H274Y in N2 NA numbering) is the most commonly reported NA mutation, in which a change from a histidine (CAC, wild type) codon to a tyrosine (TAC, mutant type) codon confers the viral resistance to oseltamivir (CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), 2009, Renaud et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010, WHO (World Health Organization), 2010b). Other mutations neighboring the active site might alter oseltamivir susceptibility, but data to support this are inconclusive (Hurt et al., 2009, Sheu et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Rapid detection of oseltamivir resistance is clinically essential for directing appropriate care in a pandemic season. The NA inhibition assay is considered the gold standard (Gubareva et al., 2002, Mungall et al., 2003) but is time consuming and technically complex, making it impractical for use in clinical laboratories. The mismatched amplification mutation and cycling probe methods offer molecular alternatives (Hata et al., 2010, Suzuki et al., 2011) but are not specific to the 2009 H1N1 virus. Detection of H275Y using genotypic-specific primers may be useful (Operario et al., 2010), but the procedures are not straightforward for clinical laboratories. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) could be useful for detection (Bolotin et al., 2009, Renaud et al., 2010), and the assay, however, either was for seasonal influenza A or needed 2 reactions with multiple primers, and data interpretation is indirect. We describe a molecular assay using RT-PCR coupled with a pyrogram procedure (RT-PCR-pyroseq) to detect the NA H275 residue of 2009 H1N1. This assay has a short analytical time, is relatively simple to perform, and provides direct results for characterizing oseltamivir resistance in 2009 H1N1.",

            "text": "Detection of drug-resistant viral variants for patient care becomes extremely important during influenza season, especially for severe influenza cases in immunocompromised patients. Several molecular approaches have been reported for such detections as described in the Introduction section. Methods using real-time RT-PCR reported for the detection of H275Y mutation may be good either for seasonal influenza A (Bolotin et al., 2009) or for surveillance applications (Deyde, et al., 2010). Pyrosequencing for molecular marker detection has proved to be useful in surveillance laboratories (Couturier et al., 2010, Deng et al., 2011, Deyde et al., 2010). The RT-PCR-pyroseq method described here was designed for clinical laboratory applications, and the results from this study (verified by Sanger sequencing) demonstrated that it provides reliable detection of NA H275 residue sequences with analytical time below 8 h. The rapid assessment of oseltamivir susceptibility is clinically important, as traditional approaches require time-consuming and laborious viral cultivation (Lackenby et al., 2008). The RT-PCR-pyroseq method was specific for 2009 H1N1 and did not produce amplification or valid sequences from the tested non-2009 H1N1 viruses or bacteria (Table 2). The analytical sensitivity of RT-PCR-pyroseq for H275 residue sequence detection (43\u2013417 TCID50/mL; Table 1) was similar to that reported for pyrosequencing-based detection of seasonal H1N1 drug-resistant mutations (Lackenby et al., 2008). This sensitivity level should be sufficient for properly sampled positive clinical specimens, as indicated by our detection of NA H275 sequences in all tested 2009 H1N1\u2013positive clinical specimens. Compared with Sanger sequencing, the pyrosequencing method can save time and costs (about 1/5 and 1/10 of Sanger sequencing, respectively). This pyrosequencing approach is thus specific, quick, reliable, sensitive, and money-saving, which are the key traits for clinical laboratory use and may even be applicable for developing countries.",

Recent report indicated that the dual H275Y + S247N mutant in 2009 H1N1 variants had extremely high oseltamivir resistance (Hurt et al., 2011b). Meanwhile, a small number of specimens in each test run will certainly decrease the assay efficiency and increase the supply and labor costs. Precaution measures for biosafety and cross contamination should be implemented to prevent both laboratory-associated infection of laboratory personnel and testing discrepancy during processing of patient specimens. After all, the RT-PCR-pyroseq method for detection of oseltamivir resistance among 2009 H1N1 viruses is well adapted to a clinical laboratory, yielding reproducible results within a short time. This could greatly benefit patient care during upcoming influenza seasons.",
