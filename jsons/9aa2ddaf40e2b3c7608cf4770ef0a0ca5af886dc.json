E-mail: pcawthon@sfcc-cpmc.net Dear Editor, The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound effect on every aspect of daily life worldwide. Many communities are following social and physical distancing rules to mitigate the spread of the virus. Older adults are particularly susceptible to severe disease and death (1) . The impact on research studies, especially studies that involve older adults, is considerable (2) .",

Such information would help guide the continued clinical management that may be required for those who recover from acute disease. In addition, observational studies will also be able to describe the effects of the social distancing rules on the health and well-being of participants. Given the variations in the timing and strictness of these rules across the United States and worldwide, these data could help inform which aspects of social distancing may have particularly detrimental (or perhaps surprisingly beneficial) effects on older adults.",

We plan to administer this questionnaire to participants in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS, aged \u226585 years) (3) and the Study of Muscle Mobility and Aging (SOMMA, aged \u226570 years). Both studies have paused in-person assessments; so, study staff will instead administer the questionnaire by phone or by mail. An added benefit of administration of this questionnaire is that study staff can continue productive research work and meaningful engagement with study participants to maximize retention, while working from home to abide by social distancing rules.",

The questionnaire is reasonably short, and includes the three item loneliness scale (4) .

We do not ask about intubation and ventilation for several reasons. First, those responding to this questionnaire during the early phase of the pandemic are unlikely to have recovered from intubation/ventilation sufficiently to answer questions from study staff. Second, self-reported information about intubation/ventilation may be inaccurate; we recommend collection and adjudication of medical records to collect such data.
