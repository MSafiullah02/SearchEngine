Of particular importance is the question of how the model structure constrains its dynamics. This paper discusses an algebraic framework to study such questions. The systems discussed here are given by mappings on an affine space over a finite field, whose coordinate functions are polynomials. They form a general class of models which can represent many discrete model types. Assigning to such a system its dependency graph, that is, the directed graph that indicates the variable dependencies, provides a mapping from systems to graphs. A basic property of this mapping is derived and used to prove that dynamical systems with an acyclic dependency graph can only have a unique fixed point in their phase space and no periodic orbits. This result is then applied to a published model of in vitro virus competition.",

            "text": "In several areas of engineering, discrete mathematical models, such as finite state machines, Boolean networks, Petri nets, or agent-based models, play an important role in modeling processes that can be viewed as evolving in discrete time, in which state variables have only finitely many possible states. Decision processes, electrical switching networks, or intra-cellular molecular networks represent examples. There is a long tradition in the engineering literature of work related to an understanding of how the structure of such models constrains their dynamics, see, e.g., [3, 2] . This problem is important both for the design of networks as well as for their analysis. In both theoretical and applied studies of dynamical systems, the problem of predicting dynamic features of the system from structural properties is very important, see, e.g., [7, 9] . An instantiation of this problem is the question in systems biology whether the connectivity structure of molecular networks, such as metabolic or gene regulatory networks, has special features that correlate with the type of dynamics these 1 networks exhibit. (This type of application motivated the present study.) Some progress has been made on this question. For instance, in [1] it was shown that certain small network motifs appear much more often in such networks than would be expected in a random graph. The work in this paper was motivated by the desire to provide a theoretical framework within which the relationship between structure and dynamics of certain families of dynamical systems can be studied. We briefly describe this framework and show one example of a result and its implications.",

As described, such systems are set functions without additional mathematical structure. It is therefore advantageous to impose additional mathematical structure on X, namely that of a finite field. This is of course utilized in the case of Boolean networks. Evaluation of Boolean functions is equivalent to carrying out arithmetic in the Boolean field with two elements. The translation between Boolean functions and polynomials is straightforward, with the Boolean operator AND corresponding to multiplication, addition corresponding to XOR, and negation corresponding to addition of 1. Once we have a finite field structure on X, which we shall now denote by K, it is well-known that any function K n \u2212\u2192 K can be represented as a polynomial function [8, p. 369 ].

The set of n \u00d7 n matrices carries an algebraic structure using max and min operations, which has been studied previously over the real field, see, e.g., [4] . Here we prove a result about the relationship between properties of dynamical systems in P under composition and properties of the corresponding adjacency matrices in the max-min algebra. As a consequence of this result, we derive a dynamic property of PDS with acyclic dependency graphs.

In that case, the center cell plays a very special role. It is represented by the only node in the network that does not receive any inputs from other cells and is therefore constant. (Note that, in order to have an acyclic dependency graph, a PDS must have at least one node without incoming edges.) The state of that node then plays the role of an external parameter, and a particular choice of state/color for this node is part of the system description. In this We conclude that in this case any initialization of the system, that is, any assignment of colors to each of the nodes in the network, results in a unique steady state, namely the state in which all nodes have the same color as the center node.",

With a very straightforward proof we have shown that dynamics is very simple in the absence of feedback loops. It is worth observing that this result, Corollary 4.1, could also have been obtained as a consequence of a more general result that says that for the existence of more than one fixed point, a positive feedback loop is required in the dependency graph, and for periodic orbits to exist a negative feedback is necessary (but not sufficient). This result implies that in order to obtain more than one fixed point or periodic orbits, it is necessary that the dependency graph of the system have feedback loops [9] . However, the proof we have given here of this same result is very simple and stems from a basic property of the mapping P \u2212\u2192 M rather than complicated phase space arguments. It emphasizes our belief that the proper framework for studying the relationship between structure and dynamics of PDS is the algebra inherent in this mapping.",

If y = z \u2212 ky, y(0) = y 0 with k > 0, then lim t\u2192\u221e y(t) = z 0 k (regardless of the value of y 0 ). Proof. First, notice that from y = z \u2212 ky we obtain y(t) = y 0 e \u2212kt +t 0 e k(s\u2212t) z(s)ds. Furthermore, y(t) \u2212 z 0 k = y 0 e \u2212kt + t 0 e k(s\u2212t) (z(s) \u2212 z 0 )ds + t 0 e k(s\u2212t) z 0 ds \u2212 z 0 k . It is easy to show that lim t\u2192\u221e t 0 e k(s\u2212t) z 0 ds \u2212 z 0 k = lim t\u2192\u221e y 0 e \u2212kt = 0; then, we only need to show that lim t\u2192\u221e t 0 e k(s\u2212t) (z(s) \u2212 z 0 )ds = 0. First, since lim t\u2192\u221e z(t) = z 0 , it follows that z(s) is bounded (let us say by M ) and lim t\u2192\u221e sup s\u2208[ t 2 ,t] {|z(s) \u2212 z 0 |} = 0. On the other hand we have",
