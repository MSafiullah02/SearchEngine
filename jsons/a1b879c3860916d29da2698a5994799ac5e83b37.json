Even for viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm (e.g. many negative-stranded RNA viruses), it is not uncommon for specific viral proteins to enter the nucleus during certain stages of infection to achieve specific functions such as antagonising the host's immune activation (Katze et al., 2002; Ramachandran and Horvath, 2009; Goodbourn and Randall, 2009) or global inhibition of host gene expression (Petersen et al., 2000; von Kobbe et al., 2000) . The nuclear import and export of viral proteins depend on the host cell machinery and are subject to regulation by pathways that normally modulate the trafficking of cellular proteins, including post-translational modifications. Conjugation of modifying groups such as phosphate, acetyl group, ubiquitin (Ub), and Ub-like molecules is a rapid and efficient way of modulating the properties of proteins after their synthesis (Ulrich, 2005) . Particularly, Ub and small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) have drawn much attention in recent years due to their roles in diverse biological functions (Denuc and Marfany, 2010; Liu and Walters, 2010) . Although the regulatory functions of Ub and SUMO in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of cellular proteins have been extensively studied (Wilson and Rangasamy, 2001; Shcherbik and Haines, 2004) , their involvement in viral protein trafficking has been only recently appreciated.

Unmodified RanGAP1 is diffused in the cytoplasm, whereas SUMO conjugation targets it to the nuclear pore complex, where it regulates protein/RNA trafficking across the nuclear membrane (Matunis et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al., 1998) . Since then SUMO has been associated with the nuclear/subnuclear targeting of various cellular proteins (discussed below). The vertebrate genome encodes at least four SUMO isoforms, namely SUMO1-4.

The best-characterised example is the tumour suppressor gene p53 (reviewed in Shcherbik and Haines, 2004; Stehmeier and Muller, 2009; Lee and Gu, 2010) . P53 is ubiquitinated on its six C-terminal lysine residues by the E3 Ub ligase Mdm2 (Honda et al., 1997; Rodriguez et al., 2000; Lohrum et al., 2001; Nakamura et al., 2002) . Although polyubiquitination results in proteasomal degradation, monoubiquitination by the same E3 ligase leads to nuclear export (Li et al., 2003) [pathways (1) and (2) in Figure 2 ]. It has been postulated that Ub modification induces a conformational change, leading to unmasking of the NES which resides in the proximity of the Ub sites (Shcherbik and Haines, 2004) . Once in the cytoplasm, p53 can be deubiquitinated by the deubiquitinase USP10, resulting in its translocation back to the nucleus (Yuan et al., 2010) [pathway (3) in Figure  2 ]. Polyubiquitination of transcription factors Smaand MAD-related protein 3 (Smad3) and hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-\u03b1) has also been linked to their export from the nucleus and termination of transcriptional activation (Fukuchi et al., 2001; Groulx and Lee, 2002) . Alternatively, ubiquitination can favour cytoplasmic localisation by inhibiting nuclear import, which is exemplified in the case of CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT-\u03b1). The regulatory enzyme CCT-\u03b1 can switch between an inactive form in the cytoplasm and an active form in the nucleus. It possesses an NLS located in close proximity of the putative ubiquitination site. By using CCT\u03b1-Ub hybrid constructs that vary in the intermolecular distance between Ub and the NLS, the authors showed that monoubiquitination masks the NLS, resulting in the disruption of importin-\u03b1 binding and consequently a blockage in the nuclear import (Chen and Mallampalli, 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 234, "text": "Shcherbik and Haines, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 235, "end": 262, "text": "Stehmeier and Muller, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 263, "end": 280, "text": "Lee and Gu, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 367, "end": 387, "text": "(Honda et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 388, "end": 411, "text": "Rodriguez et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 412, "end": 432, "text": "Lohrum et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 433, "end": 455, "text": "Nakamura et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 587, "end": 604, "text": "(Li et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 798, "end": 826, "text": "(Shcherbik and Haines, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 959, "end": 978, "text": "(Yuan et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1254, "text": "(Fukuchi et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1276, "text": "Groulx and Lee, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1945, "text": "(Chen and Mallampalli, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 630, "end": 638, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 995, "end": 1004, "text": "Figure  2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Ub and nuclear import/export"}, {"text": "There are currently few examples of Ub playing a direct role in the nuclear import of target proteins.

The ubiquitination sites have been mapped to the Cterminal lysine residues (K263, K280 and K284). Mutating these three K residue results in a dramatic reduction of polyUb and monoUb of Tax, whereas the three N-terminal K residues have minimal effect on Tax Ub (Chiari et al., 2004) . Several groups have shown that ubiquitination of Tax is associated with its cytoplasmic localisation, although whether this is effectuated through promoting nuclear export or Review cytoplasmic retention is still controversial (discussed below). Gatza et al. (2007) showed that monoUb promotes the nuclear export of Tax in response to DNA damage [pathway (1) in Figure 3 ]. Following UV irradiation, a rapid translocation of Tax from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was observed. The UV-induced translocation correlates with an increase in monoUb of Tax at K280 and K284 residues. The K280/284R double mutant is not ubiquitinated and does not translocate to the cytoplasm after UV treatment. Moreover, fusing a copy of Ub to either the N-terminal or C-terminal of Tax to mimic monoubiquitination induces nuclear export. Interestingly, the nuclear export of the Tax-Ub fusion protein is blocked by leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM-1-dependent pathway, indicating that the Ub-induced nuclear export of Tax is still dependent on a functional NES. The authors proposed that monoUb facilitates the dissociation of Tax from TSS in the nucleus, promoting its nuclear export (Gatza et al., 2007) . Lamsoul et al. (2005) also reported that Ub favours cytoplasmic localisation of Tax. Overexpression of Ub results in increased cytoplasmic localisation of Tax, which is phenocopied by fusing one copy of Ub to the C-terminal of the protein. Because co-localisation between Tax and exogenously expressed Ub is observed only in the cytoplasm, the authors concluded that ubiquitination is involved in the cytoplasmic retention of Tax.

SUMOylation seems to be required for targeting Tax to nuclear bodies [pathway (2) in Figure 3 ] because Ub/SUMO site mutants fail to localise to nuclear speckles, and nuclear body formation can be restored by C-terminal fusion of SUMO but not Ub (Lamsoul et al., 2005) .

LF2 binding induces the translocation of Rta from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and represses its activity, but this redistribution of Rta seems to be independent of its SUMOylation (Calderwood et al., 2008; Heilmann et al., 2010) . Similarly, Zta can be modified by SUMO-1, 2 and 3, but in contrast to Rta, SUMO-1 modification of Zta seems to repress its transactivation activity (Adamson and Kenney, 2001; Adamson, 2005; Hagemeier et al., 2010) . SUMOylation does not seem to play a role in the subcellular localisation of Zta because its localisation pattern remains unaltered when SUMO-1 is overexpressed or when its SUMO-1 conjugation site is mutated (Adamson, 2005; Hagemeier et al., 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 130, "text": "(de Oliveira et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 535, "end": 555, "text": "(Speck et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 762, "end": 781, "text": "(Chang et al., 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 782, "end": 803, "text": "(Chang et al., , 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1086, "text": "(Calderwood et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1109, "text": "Heilmann et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1286, "text": "(Adamson and Kenney, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1301, "text": "Adamson, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1325, "text": "Hagemeier et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1550, "text": "(Adamson, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1574, "text": "Hagemeier et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epstein-Barr virus proteins"}, {"text": "EBNA3C is a viral latent antigen involved in primary B cell transformation by EBV (Saha et al., 2009) .

Ub depletion by proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and bortezomib restricts matrix to the nucleus, which is phenocopied by mutating the putative ubiquitination site (K258) from lysine to arginine. Moreover, fusing a copy of Ub to mimic monoubiquitination restores nuclear export to the K258R mutant, supporting the hypothesis that monoubiquitination of matrix promotes its nuclear export. However, our current data are also compati-ble with an alternative model in which ubiquitination inhibits nuclear import of the protein, favouring cytoplasmic retention.
