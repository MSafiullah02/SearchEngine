During the first 4 months of spread, this deadly disease has infected about three million people resulting in about two hundred thousand deaths in more than 209 countries. These figures are mostly of the hospital admissions of a handful countries as reported by the media. Real numbers would never be known. The United States of America has the maximum number of casualties as well as infections, followed by Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. These figures are largely reported by a handful of developed countries. However, there is limited information of fatalities reported from developing countries, many of which do not have adequate testing facilities and/or hospital beds to treat all the patients. Therefore, the extent of actual damage by COVID-19 would be limited in its accuracy.",

During 165-180 A.D., the Antonine Plague, is thought have killed more than five million people in the Roman Empire. During 541-542 the bubonic plague, named as Justinian (after the name of the Emperor) killed up to one tenth of the world's population [12] . The Black Death during 1346-53 killed more than half of the population of Europe [12] . During 1545-48, the Cocoliztli epidemic took the lives of fifteen million people of Mexico and Central America. The Great Plague of London during 1965-66 killed about one hundred thousand people, and the Great Plague of Marseille during 1720-1723 wiped out thirty percent of the population of the area [12] . The Russian plague during 1770-1772 took the lives of about one hundred thousand people in and around Moscow, and Flu pandemic during 1889-1890 took the lives of about one million people globally [12] .",

According to [18] , administration of moxifloxacin, Lopinavir, interferon, and methylprednisolone to non-ICU patients was successful in treating ICU patients-26 patients were discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) and sixteen were relived from the hospital. There are some unconfirmed success stories of treatment of COVID-19 with herbal ingredients like black seeds, ginger, and honey, etc. These ingredients are indeed recognised as good for health in general.

There seems to be some controversy about the effectiveness of face masks. Various outlets have frequently reported the shortage of medical grade masks (N95) due to high demand for medical professionals and general public globally. The Centers for Diseases and Prevention (CDC) has also advised people to use face masks, and even use cloth masks if proper ones are not available. Studies have revealed that even the best face masks cannot prevent some unfiltered air getting through. In order to make them highly effective, social distancing is recommended to reduce the risk of contaminated droplets being spread from an infected person to other people through coughing or sneezing. Self-isolation is also a very useful technique to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",

According to [24], world's working class, estimated to be more than three and a quarter billion strong is being severely impacted by the sudden and unimaginable slowdown in the world economy causing unprecedented loss in employment in all countries. One of the reasons cited for the heavy toll lies in the fact that more than four-fifth of the workforce lives in countries which are under severe restrictions of distancing and lockdown due to curfews and other mandatory closures. According to [26] , decline in working hours by 1st Aril 2020 is estimated to be equivalent to two hundred million fulltime job loss. Many developed countries are facing a two digit unemployment rate forcing people to seek unemployment benefits, severely impacting the economies of those countries. If the pandemic is prolonged, the loss of jobs could be many folds.
