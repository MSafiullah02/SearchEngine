All of these materials will find their way into sewage systems during the process of waste elimination (toilet flushing) and cleaning (e.g., bathing, hand washing). In addition to release during active infection, pathogens can be washed into sewage systems from cleaning of indoor (floor washing, kitchen sink use) and outdoor (auto washing, driveway cleaning, storm water collection) facilities. Thus, sewer systems collect pathogens from over a wide area to a common carrier, where they are transported to a central facility for processing.",

Monitoring of centralized wastewater allows detection of intentional, natural, or accidental contamination events. Because of recent bioterrorism concerns in the U.S., routine monitoring is potentially useful since it can result in better preparedness of utilities and the public health response system (Meinhardt, 2005). The qualitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework can be used as a tool to develop and interpret this type of wastewater monitoring system. Because the threat level drives the risk assessment analysis, a monitoring system should be coordinated with findings from modeling studies on the survival and dispersion of contaminants (Kim et al., 2007, Romero et al., 2008, Sinclair et al., 2008), the contaminant point of introduction (Danneels and Finley, 2004), the health risk (Haas et al., 1999), and the locations of early warning systems/sensors in wastewater and water treatment systems (Murray et al., 2004).",

Monitoring programs for pathogens or surrogates could potentially aid in the accomplishment of these goals. The aim of this review of published literature and reports is to assess the feasibility of monitoring sewage systems as an early warning system for the release of pathogens from an intentional, natural, or accidental biological contamination event. We address issues from a QMRA perspective and explore methods to detect and monitor pathogens in wastewater. The review presents our conclusions on: (1) the potential biological agents that might be released into a sewage system, (2) the likely background level of those agents in sewage, (3) laboratory methods and detection, and (4) the probability of detecting select biological agents in sewage.",

As indicated in Table 9.3\nand a previous publication (Sinclair et al., 2008), many select agents may occur in bodily excretions or secretions even though this may not be their primary site of replication. It would appear that all of the viral agents are excreted in the urine and most of the bacterial agents in the feces or saliva. Since none of the organisms cause enteric infections they have seldom been sought in sewage, however, Bacillus anthracis and Yersina pestis (plague) have been detected in sewage. The source of B. anthracis spores in the sewage was believed to be from an African import tannery operation (Perone and Gelosa, 1982) and presumably not from enteric infections, which would normally result in the presence of spores in the feces. Category B agents differ in that, and they include many enteric pathogens which are excreted in large numbers in the feces (Table 9.3). All of the other agents in this category appear to be excreted in the feces; many of the viral agents are excreted in the urine. No studies were found that report examining sewage for their presence. The Category C viral agents appear to be excreted in the saliva and urine (Tables 9.3 and 9.4\n). No references for the presence of these agents in sewage could be found. Some typical blood-borne agents such as Hepatitis B virus (Alter et al., 1977) and Human Immuno-Deficiency virus (Levy, 1989) have been detected in sewage by molecular methods (Table 9.4). The coronavirus, which causes Severe Acute Respiratory Disease (SARS), is also excreted in the feces and other bodily fluids such as tears (Loon et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2005) (Table 9.4).",

            "text": "The duration and concentration of pathogens released by a host during the course of an infection varies, with greater numbers being released in more severe infections. After infection, the number of organisms released usually rises rapidly reaching a peak when the symptoms appear in symptomatic infections. This is usually followed with a long decline in the amount of agent released by the host as long as death does not occur. For example, poliovirus appears in the throat and feces 7\u201310 days before clinical illness (fever) is apparent and may be excreted for more than 30 days after infection (Fig. 9.2\n). Poliovirus will also be detectable in the blood and urine during the course of infection (Pichichero et al., 1998). Hepatitis A virus appears in the stool of infected individuals 2\u20133 weeks before clinical illness (Belshe, 1991). Parainfluenza, a virus related to influenza, can be detected in nasal secretions in less than 24 h after infection and up to 2 weeks afterward (Belshe, 1991). In the case of SARS, the virus may still be present in the feces for 37 days after infection (Holmes, 2003). Variola major, the virus that causes smallpox, is released for up to 19 days after infection at concentrations of 102\u2013105 per ml of urine (Table 9.5\n) (Sarkar et al., 1973). In many infections, the greatest concentrations are released during the first few days after the initial infection. Brucella abortus is excreted in concentrations as high as 106 per ml of urine for up to 12 weeks (Table 9.6\n). Marburg virus and flaviviruses are excreted in the urine of animals for 10\u201312 days. In summary, all of the nonenteric agents of interest (Categories A, B, and C) are released in the host for at least days to weeks in concentrations likely to be detectable in sewage systems (Table 9.6) (Sinclair et al., 2008).",

In the case of enteric viruses, the ratio of viruses detected by infectivity assay may be 100\u201350,000 times less than that detected by a molecular method (Ward et al., 1984). This is because cell culture methods have a low efficiency in virus quantification from clinical and environmental samples; however, they do provide a robust measure of viral activity not feasible with molecular methods.",

Many of the enteric viruses such as the enteroviruses and adenoviruses may replicate both in the intestinal and respiratory tract. Using molecular methods the number of enteric viruses detected can approach peak concentrations of 1012 organisms per gram of stool while protozoa can approach 106-107 per gram. Cultivatable enteric bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella may also occur in concentrations as large as 1011 per gram (Feachem et al., 1983). By infectivity assays, the concentration of respiratory viruses ranges from 105 to 107 per ml of respiratory secretion. Even blood-borne viruses such as HIV will be found in the feces of infected persons (Ansari et al., 1992) and it appears that many viruses will occur in the urine during infection of the host (Table 9.6), although these excreted viruses may not be infectious. Little information is available on the concentration of pathogenic viruses or bacterial agents of interest in the urine. The total amount of virus released by a person is, of course, also related to the amount of feces, urine, respiratory secretion, and skin that is released by the person.

The relationship between the occurrence of poliovirus in sewage and clinical incidence of disease in a community was first noted in the late 1960s (Nelson et al., 1967). These early detection studies were designed as longitudinal epidemiological investigations to assess the success of polio vaccination campaigns (Riordan, 1962). The results of these studies demonstrated that a definite correlation exists among the isolation of enteroviruses in sewage, and the isolation of viruses in stools, and the number of recognized clinical cases within the community. Using cell culture assay techniques (which measure only infective viruses) and only grab samples (i.e., no steps to concentrate the sample) poliovirus could be detected when only 0.27\u20130.4% of the population was excreting the virus. It was also demonstrated that small outbreaks and epidemics of enterovirus and adenovirus disease within a community can be predicted by monitoring a community\u2019s sewage. Virulent or wildtype (nonvaccine strain) poliovirus type 1 was detected in sewage 9 days before the first clinical case became evident (Kuwert et al., 1970). In an outbreak of Coxsackievirus B5, the virus was detected in the sewage 10 days before clinical cases were positive (Nelson et al., 1967). These studies make it clear that grab samples collected on a regular (weekly or every few days) basis could be used to assess the introduction of a new infectious agent in the community. This approach was later adapted to monitor the success of poliovirus vaccine campaigns internationally (WHO, 2003).",

The World Health Organization has published guidelines for the environmental surveillance of poliovirus circulation (WHO, 2003). These guidelines assume that a single infected person will excrete 107 polioviruses per day and that one person infected in 100 could be detected using an infectivity assay without concentrating the sewage. However, if the tested sample is concentrated 100 fold then one infected person among 10,000 could be detected.",

In the past this has been accomplished by using different cell lines or incubation conditions to limit the growth of the vaccine strains. However, today this can be accomplished by the use of molecular methods and sequence analysis. Sequences amplified directly from processed sewage samples by PCR using primer pairs specific for the indigenous type 1 genotype could be used to assess its occurrence in the presence of vaccine strains (Tambini et al., 1993). Vaccine strains have unique sequences from wild type strains of pathogens allowing easy differentiation. In addition, sequence analysis of sewage isolations has been shown useful in tracking the spread of wild type poliovirus from one country and community to another (Deshpande et al., 2003, Manor et al., 1999). This review of poliovirus is offered here as a case study and justification for the use of monitoring additional CDC select biological agents. With current molecular techniques and updated concentration methods, a much greater sensitivity and specificity can be achieved for poliovirus and many other CDC select agents.",

It was also demonstrated that pathogens can be greatly retarded in a sewage systems allowing a detection time over many days for a one-time release into a sewage system.

Based upon the conclusions of the Helsinki experiment, which measured infectious poliovirus (Table 9.11), one individual excreting 108 infectious virus per gram of feces for a period of 4 days could be identified in a population of 10,000. If we consider the concentration and amount of infectious agent in the fluid or feces released during infection, this same sensitivity should be achieved with the agents of smallpox, Brucella, botulism and perhaps influenza.

Because PCR can detect both culturable and nonculturable organisms, it can be expected to be more sensitive than methods that have been used in the past for sewage surveillance. Use of PCR should increase sensitivity by as much as 50,000 over cultivation methods (Ward et al., 1984). Also, when using PCR to detect viruses in sewage, a 10-fold loss in sensitivity is likely with current methods. This loss is due to interfering substances present in the sewage, but still leaves a method that may be 5000 times more sensitive than conventional culture methods. Increasing the volume of wastewater that is tested may also increase the sensitivity of current methods. Technology is available (Hurst and Crawford, 2002) which allows for the concentration of bacteria and viruses from up to 10 l of raw sewage. Thus, increasing the volume analyzed from 400 to 4000 ml could increase the sensitivity of detection another 10-fold.",
