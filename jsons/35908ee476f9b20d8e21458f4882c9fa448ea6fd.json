In particular, the different restrictive actions taken by governments to prevent the spread of the virus have changed the way humans interact and conceive interaction. Due to geographical, behavioral, or economic factors, different sub-groups among a population are more (or less) likely to interact, and thus to spread/acquire the virus. In this work, we present a general multi-group SEIRA model for representing the spread of COVID-19 among a heterogeneous population and test it in a numerical case of study. By highlighting its applicability and the ease with which its general formulation can be adapted to particular studies, we expect our model to lead us to a better understanding of the evolution of this pandemic and to better public-health policies to control it.",

From the first self-isolation measures to total lock-downs and quarantines for preventing its spreading, the way humans interact has changed, and probably, for good. Joined efforts from the scientific community have helped to design strategies for supporting public-health policies, and for providing a better understanding of the current scenario. In particular, several mathematical models have been proposed in recent weeks to fit public databases on the SARS-CoV2 outbreak and forecast its evolution. Despite their particularities, most of them evolve from the well-known SIR model proposed by [1] . The basic idea behind this model, and its variants, is to divide a population in different compartments, representing the S (susceptible), E (exposed), I (infected), A (asymptomatic), R (recovered), D (dead), Q (quarantined), among other fractions of it. Centering our analysis on the spread of COVID-19, and restricting our search to those models recently proposed, we may find different combinations of the variables mentioned above.",

[8] presented a modified SEIR model, where variables S and E had an in-out function, accounting for quarantine, and E was considered to be infectious. Even though the model involved several variables, the parameter-fitting stage only considered an exponential approximation, leaving unclear how the infection and recovery rates were decoupled. Another variant of SEIR models was presented by [9] , including an equation for the concentration of SARS-CoV2 in the environmental reservoir. [10] present a sophisticated 7-compartment variant of SEIR models, where the extra variables account for the quarantined Q, dead D, and insusceptible P fractions of the population. Moreover, their model includes the temporal evolution of the rates of recovery and infection-driven death. [11] used a stochastic dynamic model to fit publicly available datasets of Wuhan to give better insights on the early dynamics of COVID-19, and therefore predict if newly introduced cases would generate outbreaks in other areas. [12] present several public health recommendations, based on the modeling of the effect of different regulations for preventing the spread of COVID-19 on a SEIRA model similar to the one presented by [13] , highlighting the challenges that an epidemic of an aerial contagious virus with asymptomatic patients pose.",

In our model, we represent the interactions between the different groups by a non-necessarily symmetrical matrix connecting the different sub-groups, accounting for the fraction that effectively interacts. Particularities of novel COVID-19 were used to model the infection dynamics, so individuals could be infected by foreigners in their region, or while they are visiting a different one.

Fractions of C are likely to provide services in zones A and B, and therefore interact with their population. Zone B acts as the center of the city, where people meet for office work. Supposing e is the characteristic fraction of the population working in different zones, the interaction matrix \u03a6 1 in normal circumstances (Case 1) is given by equation 13. Once the outbreak took place in A, its dynamics were controlled by parameters (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8), which were also valid for its propagation to B. As life quality and access to public-health is worse in C, we will suppose such parameters to be, respectively, half and double from the values reported for them in A. The contagious rate in C would also be higher (for example, a 10% higher), as the lack of work-safety policies would press people to work even if they already started to feel sick. Then, the dynamics in C would be characterized by (2\u03b2, \u03b3 2 , 1.1\u03b8). Aware of this consideration, but unable to quantify its effect, the government studied to isolate A partially and to limit its contact with C, generating a new interaction matrix \u03a6 2 (Case 2): Other studied possibilities were the reduction of social interaction by the application of obligatory quarantine after a time t c from the day of the first infection, generating cases 3 and 4, which considered the evolution of case 1 or 2 respectively. Following the idea of [24] , we assume the rate of contagion is directly proportional to the factor of exposure, so that: Figure 4 show the results of numerical simulations of cases 1-4. The comparison of the different scenarios shows that under these considerations our model was able to adequately represent the effect of the dynamics, providing useful insights to lead the decision-making processes when different behavioral groups interact.
