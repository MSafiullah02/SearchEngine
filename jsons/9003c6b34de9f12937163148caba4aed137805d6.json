We studied the epidemiological and clinical outcomes in 55 asymptomatic carriers who were laboratory confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 through nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swab samples.

It was reported that the virus was transmitted between humans [2, 3] , especially among family members [4] . Prompt public health measures were taken in China, including intensive surveillance and epidemiological investigations. According to the latest recommendations [5] , 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is classified into 4 types: mild, ordinary, severe, and critical. Mild and ordinary cases have good prognoses, but severe cases, and especially critical cases, always present with systematic organ dysfunction and involve prolonged hospitalization [6] . To date, no obvious breakthroughs in the treatment of severe coronavirus infection have been identified. Previous reports have indicated that the onset of symptoms may help physicians identify patients with poor prognosis and that meticulous supportive care can be effective [7] .",

To better minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, preventive measures focusing on high-risk populations are recommended.
