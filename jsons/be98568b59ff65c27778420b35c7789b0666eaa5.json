However, difficulties in obtaining samples from patients or convalescent subjects have hampered research in this direction. We demonstrated a strategy, tetramer-guided epitope mapping, that specific CD41 T cell epitopes can be identified by using PBMC from subjects that have not been exposed to the infectious organism. Sixteen HLA-DR0401-and 14 HLA-DR0701-restricted epitopes within spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were identified. Among these, spike protein residues 159-171, 166-178, 449-461 and 1083-1097 were identified to contain naturally processed immunodominant epitopes based on strong in vitro T cell responses of PBMC (as assayed by tetramer staining) to intact spike protein stimulation. These immunodominant epitopes were confirmed in vivo in HLA-DR0401 transgenic mice by immunizing with spike protein. Furthermore, the epitope-specific T cells from naive donors secreted IFN-g and IL-13 upon re-stimulation with corresponding tetramers.

Identification of dominant T cell epitopes within the infectious organism using blood samples from infected or convalescent subjects is one of the steps that are essential for understanding and monitoring host immune responses. However, these samples can be difficult or impractical to obtain, in part because of geographic location and relative disease rarity.

In 2003, the brief outbreak of the disease resulted in >8000 cases with ;10% mortality (8) . SARS-CoV, the pathogen responsible for SARS, is a positive-sense, single-strand, ;29 700-nt RNA virus (9) . SARS-CoV is related to but genomically and serologically distinct from other common coronaviruses (5, 10) , including strains 229E and OC43 that cause 15-30% of common colds in humans (11, 12) . Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV encodes four major structural proteins, the spike (S), envelope, matrix glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid protein (8, (13) (14) (15) . Among these, the S protein plays a central role in mediating viral infection via receptor binding and membrane fusion with susceptible cells (16, 17) . Natural human infection with SARS-CoV induces a long-lived neutralizing antibody response against the S protein (18, 19) . There is also a good correlation between neutralizing antibody titer and protection from wild-type virus challenge in murine studies (20) . In addition, it has been demonstrated that S protein is a dominant antigen for CD8+ T cell responses (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . To date, few studies have focused on CD4+ T cells in SARS-CoV infection (26, 27) . As a result, very little is known about the SARS-CoV epitopes recognized by CD4+ T cells. In applying the tetramer-guided epitope mapping (TGEM) approach, we identified several naturally processed epitopes derived from SARS-CoV S protein by using PBMC from healthy subjects. These S protein-specific CD4+ T cells are present and responsive to antigen stimulation in most healthy subjects. As expected, these antigenspecific T cells were phenotypically naive, but they secreted significant amounts of IFN-c and IL-13 following antigen stimulation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using PBMC from healthy subjects to identify T cell epitopes of a microbe recognized by the naive repertoire.

Identification of T cell epitopes against these infectious microbes is a key step in understanding how the human immune system reacts against these pathogens. However, blood samples from infected human subjects are not readily available for research. In response to this problem, we hypothesized that relevant T cell responses could be induced and studied using blood samples from nonexposed individuals. We developed a protocol in which PBMC from healthy subjects were used to identify antigenic peptides within the spike protein of SARS-CoV. In these experiments, cells were stimulated with overlapping peptides that span the entire spike protein and positive T cell responses were screened by the TGEM approach (29) (30) (31) . Subsequent validation of these peptides by stimulating PBMC from multiple subjects with intact spike protein and by immunizing HLA transgenic mice indicated that several of these peptides contain epitopes that were naturally processed and presented.

While some subjects had a measurable response to more peptides than others, positive responses were detected in every subject studied. To some degree, it was surprising that antigen-specific T cells could be expanded and detected with relative ease from the naive population in the absence of dendritic cells. However, our previous study of CD4+ T cells directed against anthrax-protective antigen (32) implied that this approach would be feasible. The key factor for measuring these naive responses may be our use of tetramers, which can detect responses consisting of <0.5% of the total expanded T cell population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "When measuring T cell responses to peptides, there is a possibility that only some of the responses correspond to naturally processed epitopes.

Additional experiments using sorted tetramer-positive cell lines confirmed that p32, p126 and p136 were also naturally processed and presented, while p121 was not naturally processed. The remaining putative epitopes could not be individually tested by protein stimulation because our attempts to clone tetramer-positive T cells failed. In our previous studies of other antigenic proteins (32, 33) , ;80% of the peptides identified using peptide stimulation and tetramers were shown to be naturally processed. Therefore, we expect that some of these uncharacterized epitopes are actually naturally processed. The remaining peptides, along with p121, may reflect 'false-positive' artifacts of the peptide stimulation or these could be cryptic epitopes that can only be processed and presented by certain cell types or under certain inflammatory conditions.

Given the length of the peptides used and the lack of endogenous mouse class II protein, these recall responses almost certainly reflect DR0401-restricted CD4 T cell responses. The fact that the immunodominant epitopes observed in these transgenic animals mirror those identified in vitro using tetramers further validates the efficacy of our strategy.

A paired sequence homology analysis was performed for the selected peptides against S protein sequences from several other coronaviruses, including human coronavirus 229E, human coronavirus NL63, human coronavirus OC43 and human coronavirus HKU1. The observed homology was insufficient to suggest CD4+ T cell cross-reactivity with these other S proteins (Supplementary Figure 3 , available at International Immunology Online). Rather, the homology analysis implied that the identified epitopes are unique for SARS S protein. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that CD4+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV peptides (p22, p23, p41, p62 and p148) were readily detected in sorted CD45RA+ (naive) but not sorted CD45RA\u00c0 (memory) T cells (Supplementary Figure 4 , available at International Immunology Online). So it would appear that the observed SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T cells were naive rather than cross-reactive memory cells specific for other coronaviruses. These results differ from a previous study in which H5N1-reactive T cells were detected in healthy Caucasian subjects (32) . In that study, the majority of H5N1-reactive T cells was of memory phenotype and showed cross-reactivity to previous circulating influenza viruses.
