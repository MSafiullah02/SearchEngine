Travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) and long-term travelers have higher exposures to vector-borne infections such as malaria, and are less likely to take health precautions before and during their residence abroad. These categories of travelers may be important groups that need to be reached with pre-travel advice.10,11 Immigrants and migrant workers who return from lower-income countries to visit friends and relatives may also introduce vector-borne infections such as chikungunya into new geographic locations that did not have prior endemic infection.12 As a clinician, how do we prepare travelers for these unpredictable events? We do know that most emerging infections have zoonotic origins and many have viral pathogens as etiologic agents. The primary routes of transmission include contact with animals, mosquito bites and respiratory exposure to infected persons. This can form the basis for advice to travelers who want to take the appropriate precautions, and provide targeted screening criteria for ill travelers returning from outbreak-affected areas. For example, travelers to China should be advised to avoid contact with poultry to minimize their risk of acquiring avian influenza, and those going to the Middle East should understand that current medical knowledge indicates that camels and bats are potential animal reservoirs or intermediaries for MERS-CoV infection.13,14",

Various national or international websites such as the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Centres for Disease Control (ECDC), National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNAC) and WHO are of great benefit and provide resources to guide practice. Travel medicine conferences bring clinicians together with industry and academic partners to share updates on travel medicine and discuss issues of relevance. HealthMap trawls internet sources in different languages and provides near real-time ability to geo-locate disease occurrences and outbreaks.16 Ultimately, however, it is not information systems but the networks of people and astute clinicians who make sense of data, identify emerging trends and minimize the effects of emerging infections.",
