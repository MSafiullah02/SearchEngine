After excluding these patients, 132 patients were finally included. The patients' baseline demographic characteristics are given in Table 1 .

Diabetes was diagnosed based on the 2019 WHO diagnostic criteria for diabetes [5] . The COVID-19 patients were divided into three groups: A, B, and C. Patients in group A had no diabetes and their HbA1c level was 6.0; patients in group B had no diabetes and their HbA1c level was >6.0; patients in group C were diabetic.

This is the first study to report that diabetic patients contracting COVID-19 have more severe inflammation and higher mortality [6] , and that inflammations markers such as serum ferritin level, CRP level, and ESR in COVID-19 cases and the coagulation factor Fbg were positively correlated with HbA1c level, while SaO 2 was negatively correlated with HbA1c level. Even in patients with only elevated HbA1c level and no diabetes, the levels of inflammation markers and Fbg were also significantly increased ( Fig. 1 , P < 0.05). However, little is known about the mechanism concerning the increase in the levels of inflammation markers and HbA1c level in case of COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that diabetes not only causes epithelial dysfunction of pulmonary cilia, increased vascular system permeability, alveolar epithelial damage, and alveolar collapse but also contributes to abnormal immune system function [7, 8] . Similarly, in severely ill COVID-19 patients, the lungs, spleen, and lymph node structures are damaged, and lymphocyte counts are reduced [9] . Both diabetes and COVID-19 may synergistically damage the Table 2 immune and respiratory systems. Further, diabetic patients have more comorbidities due to which there is more target organ damage; this together with COVID-19 leads to a more severe inflammation, hypercoagulability, an even low oxygenation, and eventually higher mortality. COVID-19 patients with higher HbA1c level may exhibit relatively higher level of severity, and the infection itself may also lead to an increase in HbA1c level. Previous studies have also found that in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients, even those with mild symptoms (who do not receive glucocorticoid therapy during the course of the disease), had higher fasting blood glucose levels [10] . In our study, after excluding treatment with exogenous corticosteroids, hemolysis, the HbA1c level of 66.7% (88/132) patients was still higher than normal (4.0-6.0%), of which 12.1% (16/132) patients were newly diagnosed with diabetes. For the new-onset diabetes patients, previously reported studies along with this study suggest that COVID-19 may cause and aggravate abnormal glucose metabolism.",

Previous studies have reported that some viruses can directly cause pancreatic b-cell damage [11, 12] , and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor has higher expression in pancreatic endocrine tissues than in exocrine tissues [13] . Autopsy showed that although a small number of islet cells were degenerated in pancreatic tissue, while immunohistochemical analysis and polymerase chain reaction tests did not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic islet cells [9] , thus indicating that there is insufficient evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2-induced damage of islet cells. Levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, CRP, serum amyloid A, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 have been shown to be increased in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. IL-1b can cause islet b cell dysfunction and apoptosis, and the levels of these factors can be reduced by lifestyle-related changes and weight loss, which suggests that inflammatory markers may be involved in islet b cell damage and insulin resistance [14] . Inflammatory factors released in response to SARS-CoV-2 may also be involved in islet b-cell damage and insulin resistance resulting in abnormal glucose metabolism. In our study, patients had 14 (IQR 10.0-17.8) days from the onset of symptoms to admission. Abnormal glucose metabolism for a long period of time may cause an increase in HBV1c level.",

Second, due to the limitation caused by the number of deaths, multivariate regression analysis could not be performed to determine whether the increase in HbA1c level was an independent risk factor for the death of COVID-19 patients. Third, after 3 years of follow-up of SARS patients, Yang et al. found that the fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, and insulin levels of the SARS group and their paired healthy non-SARS siblings were similar, suggesting that SARS-CoV-related islet damage and insulin resistance is for a short duration. Similarly, whether the increase in HBA1c level in COVID-19 patients is transient is also uncertain due to the short observation time; hence, further investigations are required.",
