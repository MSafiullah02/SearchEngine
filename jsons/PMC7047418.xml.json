            "text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is highly prevalent worldwide. It is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), a disease associated with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, reproductive disorders, enteric diseases and respiratory signs, which are responsible for great economic losses [1]. Horizontal transmission via the respiratory tract is one of the main routes of PCV2 infection [2]. Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is considered to be a commensal colonizer of the upper respiratory tract in swine, but it can also breach the epithelial barriers and cause infections, leading to arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia and septicemia [3, 4]. A total of 35 serotypes have been reported based on capsular polysaccharide antigens, and serotype 2 (SS2) is frequently isolated from clinical diseased pigs [5]. In clinical studies, coinfections can often be determined among PCVAD cases [6]. The morbidity and mortality of PCVAD increases when PCV2 affected pig herds experience secondary infections or concurrent infections with other pathogens, such as Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae [6, 7]. In recent years, PCV2 and S. suis coinfection cases have been frequently detected [8]; however, there is poor understanding of whether/how PCV2 increases the risk of infection with S. suis.",

Both PCV2 and SS2 are pathogens that can cause disease through infection of the respiratory tract; thus, we hypothesized that PCV2 could promote SS2 translocation across the respiratory epithelial barrier. The respiratory epithelium is an important barrier to defend against foreign particles; dysfunction of the epithelial barrier is an important cause of pathogen invasions [10]. The integrity of the epithelial barrier is maintained by intercellular junctional complexes, including tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes [11, 12]. Tight junction proteins (TJ) are located at the apicolateral boundary of epithelial cells, and they significantly contribute to the barrier function of the epithelium [12]. However, the integrity of TJ could be disrupted during infection, resulting in the passage of microbial pathogens into subepithelial tissues [13]. The aim of the study is to investigate whether and how PCV2 infection disrupts TJ and contributes to SS2 translocation.",

Piglets were infected with PCV2 through intranasal (2 mL) and intramuscular (3 mL) inoculation or inoculated with DMEM through the same route. The infective doses and inoculation methods were determined by consulting the literature [22, 23]. Blood samples were taken at 0, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 21, 24 and 28 days post-inoculation (dpi) with PCV2 for serum isolation.

Viral loads test was performed in triplicate for each sample and each set of qRT-PCR assay was repeated three times. All the piglets were sacrificed and necropsied at 28 dpi with PCV2. The lung samples (apical, middle, caudal right lobe and accessory lobe) were collected for further analysis. The total protein and RNA extraction samples were prepared from taking equal amounts of lung tissue from different areas of the lungs.

The number of adherent bacteria was determined by spreading on THA. For invasion assay, extracellular bacteria were killed by the addition of DMEM containing 5 \u03bcg/mL penicillin (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and 100 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin (Solarbio, Beijing, China); the cells were then incubated for another hour.

The TEER increased rapidly during the initial 7 days, reaching a stable level around day 8 and this level was maintained for the next 3 days (Figure 4A). The in vitro epithelial barrier models were infected with PCV2 at day 8. Compared with the control group, PCV2 infection significantly decreased the TEER at 36 h and 48 h after infection, and there was no differences at 24 h post-infection of PCV2 (Figure 4B). Measuring of the TEER has been widely accepted as a quantitative technique for monitoring epithelial barrier integrity [30]. Then, the numbers of SS2 penetrating across the epithelial barrier model were counted after 36 h and 48 h of PCV2 infection with SS2 infection times of 2 h. The number of translocated SS2 in the PCV2 infected group was greater than that in the control group (Figure 4C). Furthermore, compared to the SS2-infected alone, PCV2 and SS2 coinfection resulted in a greater TEER reduction (Figure 4D), indicating that coinfection increased the permeability of the epithelial barrier. Thus, we established an in vitro tracheal epithelial barrier model using STEC; PCV2 infection gradually reduced the TEER value and induced breakdown of the epithelial barrier integrity; PCV2 and SS2 coinfection induced increased-permeability and more SS2 translocation compared to SS2 infection alone.",

            "text": "To detect whether the MAPK pathways regulate PCV2-induced disruption of tight junction proteins, STEC were infected with PCV2 for 36 h and 48 h (at the time points, PCV2 infection induced a decrease in the TJ levels); the phosphorylation of p38, ERK and JNK were determined by Western blot. The results show that JNK was phosphorylated, indicating that JNK was activated in the process of PCV2 infection in STEC, while activation of p38 and ERK were not detected (Figure 7A). To determine the function of JNK on tight junction proteins, STEC were treated with inhibitor SP600125 to suppress the activation of JNK during the PCV2 infection period. The cell proteins were collected at 36 h and 48 h of PCV2 post-infection. Western blot analysis shows that inhibiting the activation of JNK would lessen the PCV2 induced reduction of ZO-1 and occludin protein levels to some degree (Figure 7B). Furthermore, we analyzed the epithelial barrier integrity by quantifying the amount of FITC-dextran crossing the Transwell chamber. Relative to the uninfected control, we found that the increased paracellular permeability caused by PCV2 infection were abrogated or partially abrogated by the JNK inhibitor (Figure 7C), providing further evidence that PCV2 induced disruption of the epithelial barrier occurs through the JNK/MAPK pathway. As shown in Figure 7D, the integrity of tight junction proteins is protected when treated with JNK inhibitor in PCV2 infected STEC. In summary, PCV2 infection activates the JNK/MAPK pathway; JNK phosphorylation plays an important role in disruption of TJ in STEC, and is related to the increased-permeability of the epithelial barrier caused by PCV2 infection.",

In the present study, we demonstrate that PCV2 infection down-regulated the expression of TJ ZO-1 and occludin in the respiratory epithelium, increased the barrier permeability and contributed to the translocation of the bacterial pathogen SS2. Similar findings have been reported: rhinovirus causes the loss of ZO-1 in human airway epithelial cells and disrupts epithelial integrity, which promotes the paracellular migration of H. influenzae [33]; HIV-1 down-regulates mRNA and protein levels of TJ (claudin 1, 2, 4, occludin and ZO-1) and impairs epithelial barrier integrity allowing bacterial translocation across the epithelial monolayers [34].",

In order to study the consequences and mechanisms of PCV2-induced reduction of TJ, we established an in vitro cell infection model and tracheal epithelial barrier model with STEC. Epithelial cells are target cells for PCV2 infection in vivo and are used for culturing, and for studying internalization and infection of PCV2 in vitro [35\u201337]. Here, Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence assays were carried out to assess the effects of PCV2 on ZO-1 and occludin in STEC. The results were consistent with those in vivo that prolonged the infection time of PCV2 to 48 h in STEC. In addition, PCV2 infection reduced the TEER, increased the permeability of the tracheal epithelial barrier and increased the translocation of SS2. PCV2 infection did not increase the adhesion and invasion of SS2 to STEC during the experiment, suggesting that PCV2 promoted bacterial translocation across the epithelial barrier through the paracellular route, rather than the transcellular route. Although SS2 did not reduce protein levels of ZO-1 and occludin, the TJ were reorganized (data not published), which was reported to be associated with the increased paracellular permeability [38] and bacterial translocation [24].",

The downstream genes of the JNK signaling pathway, including AP-1, c-Jun, ATF-2 and ELK-1, are reported to regulate epithelial barrier functions [41\u201345]; further study is required to determine which downstream molecules in the JNK pathway were activated by PCV2.",
