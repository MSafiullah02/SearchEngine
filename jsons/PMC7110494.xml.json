In fact, several studies exploring and reporting the burden and clinical impact of RSV among adult populations across various geographical regions, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, have been published in the last two decades (Falsey et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2013, Volling et al., 2014, Mullooly et al., 2007, Thompson et al., 2003), including in recent years (Colosia et al., 2017, Ambrosch et al., 2018, Belongia et al., 2018, Kestler et al., 2018, Ackerson et al., 2019). RSV infections have been shown to be more severe among immunocompromised adults, those with cardiopulmonary conditions, and the elderly (Volling et al., 2014, Colosia et al., 2017, Belongia et al., 2018, Chatzis et al., 2018). Notably, various studies have suggested that the disease burden associated with RSV infections in the adult population is higher than that resulting from influenza virus infections, including in older adults (Kwon et al., 2017, Ambrosch et al., 2018, Kestler et al., 2018, Ackerson et al., 2019).",

In adults, the clinical features of RSV infection are non-specific, making its distinction from other frequent respiratory viral infections challenging (Walsh et al., 2007, Walsh and Falsey, 2012). As a result, laboratory confirmation is needed to confidently establish an RSV infection diagnosis (Walsh and Falsey 2012). Even still, compared to infants and young children, virus titers in respiratory secretions are lower and the shedding duration is shorter, further increasing the difficulty of RSV identification in adults (Hall, 1978, Falsey and Walsh, 2000, Walsh and Falsey, 2012). Optimal diagnosis requires Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays or serology, while antigen detection with immunofluorescent tests, enzyme immunoassays and cell culture are considered to be of low sensitivity in adults (Walsh and Falsey 2012).",

Third, because only a small number of included studies focused exclusively on adults, most did not characterize the adult populations assessed for RSV. Thus, we were not able to assess the differences between the adult populations evaluated in each study, which could be in part responsible for the variability observed in terms of RSV detection.",

The proportion of RSV infections among these patients was variable across included studies, even when comparing those including patients with the same condition and conducted in the same country. The included studies suggest that RSV infections may be a significant cause of hospitalization in the adult populations in Latin America, including in younger adults. In view of the scarcity of RSV data focusing exclusively on the adult population in Latin America, further studies on this matter could prove invaluable to provide a clearer understanding of this virus\u2019 real burden.",
