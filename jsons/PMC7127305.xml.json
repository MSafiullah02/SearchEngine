The parallel development of high-resolution NMR methods has increased the feasible size of RNA structures that can be determined, as evidenced by the structure of the 101-nucleotide RNA responsible for signaling core encapsidation in Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) [2\u2022]. Figure 1\nshows the average size of RNA structures determined by year, as catalogued in the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) [3]. The solution of the first ribosomal subunit structures in 2000\u20132001 demonstrated that methods for the determination of large RNA structures were available. These methods are now being widely applied to a variety of biologically important RNA structure analyses.",

Although many secondary and tertiary structure motifs have been identified and characterized in terms of sequence preference, structural constraints, energetics and dynamics, it is an open question as to whether we have observed a large or small fraction of the universe of motifs. Immediately after the structure determination of the large [5, 6] and small [7] ribosomal subunits, inspection of the rRNA structures suggested that they consisted mainly of known RNA structural elements (i.e. few, if any, novel motifs were observed). More detailed studies are showing, however, that there is an abundance of information still to be extracted from these structures and correlated with RNA structural features observed in other biomolecules.",

Other structures include the specificity domains of both A- [17] and B-type ribonuclease P [18\u2022\u2022]; RNAs corresponding to a guanine-responsive riboswitch (xpt) complexed with guanine [19\u2022\u2022] or hypoxanthine [20], and an adenosine-responsive riboswitch (add) complexed with adenosine [19\u2022\u2022]; a highly conserved stem-loop motif found at the 3\u2032 end of the genome of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus and other coronaviruses [21\u2022\u2022]; the core encapsidation signal of MMLV [2\u2022]; and complexes between a high-affinity RNA aptamer and the NF-\u03baB p50 homodimer [22], and between the archaeal RNA-binding protein L7Ae and an RNA K-turn derived from a H/ACA small RNA [23]. In addition, a series of crystal structures of the hepatitis virus ribozyme in its pre-cleaved state [24] showed that significant conformational changes take place and a metal ion is lost in comparison to the product form of the ribozyme [25]. Finally, structures of a high-salt left-handed RNA duplex [26] and a mirror image (or l-configuration) [27] RNA duplex show variations on the canonical \u2018standard\u2019 RNA double helix. These structures demonstrate not only the prevalence of well-known RNA structural motifs, but also the presence of numerous novel structural elements that potentially may serve as common modules in biological RNA.",

In MMLV, such a region, which includes three stem-loop structures, is highly conserved. The sequences of the three stem-loops (tetraloops) in this region were changed to prevent intermolecular interaction and enhance crystallization, while retaining function. The structure of this engineered, functional RNA, which corresponds to the core encapsidation signal, has been determined by NMR methods [2\u2022]. As seen in Figure 4\n, two of the stem-loops form a coaxial stack connected to the third stem-loop by a flexible linker. In addition to several familiar structural motifs, a new element, termed an \u2018A-minor kink turn\u2019, was observed. This structural feature, with similarities to both the A-minor motif and a kink turn, is formed by the interaction of an extruded uridine and a GGAA bulge. In this element, two unpaired adenosines pack in the minor groove of a neighboring stem, inducing a kink in the helix.

Currently, the most successful approach to predicting RNA motifs begins by predicting the secondary structure by means of either energy minimization using nearest neighbor thermodynamic rules, as implemented in MFOLD [40] and the Vienna RNA package [41], or covariation analysis, or a combination of both [42]. Next, potential motifs are identified in the predicted secondary structure loop regions using sizes and sequences known to be compatible with the motifs. The sequence profiles of homologous aligned RNAs are then checked against these potential motifs to confirm compatibility.

The residues involved in ribose zippers were also found to be phylogenetically conserved and to demonstrate covariation patterns.

Detailed examination of recently determined biological RNAs has revealed many new structural elements, in addition to finding repeated examples of previously characterized motifs. In fact, by far the greatest proportion of RNA structure can be described as consisting of combinations of well-characterized structural modules: double helices, motifs in hairpin loops and internal loops, and tertiary interaction motifs.

The most recent of these is a proposed RNA target, formed by kissing hairpin loop tertiary interaction motifs, for the binding of the KH2 domain of the fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP) [45]. This complex interaction competes with the binding of FMRP to brain polyribosomes and is associated with a crucial known mutation. Another example is a proposed explanation for lead toxicity by hydrolysis of mRNAs containing the leadzyme motif [46]. Finally, models of the role of mRNA secondary structure in a variety of human neurodegenerative diseases (trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases) caused by the expansion of CAG repeats in the open reading frames of certain genes have been proposed and are under active study [47, 48].",
