            "text": "The proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a crucial step in genome replication and CPs assembly in the order Picornavirales, whose genome generally translates a large precursor polyprotein. After translation, the viral precursor polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved to generate mature functional viral proteins (Dougherty and Semler, 1993). This maturation process is usually mediated by (more than one) proteases, and a 3C (for the family Picornaviridae) or 3C-like (3CL) protease (for other families) plays a central role in the cleavage of the viral precursor polyprotein (Le Gall et al., 2008, Palmenberg, 1990). To date, 3C and 3CL proteases have been extensively studied in several viruses in the order Picornavirales, particularly hepatitis A virus (HAV), poliovirus (PV), human rhinovirus (HRV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), human enterovirus 71 (EV71), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the family Picornaviridae (Bablanian and Grubman, 1993, Bonderoff et al., 2008, de Breyne et al., 2008, Ghildyal et al., 2009, Goodwin et al., 2009, Harmon et al., 1992, Lawson et al., 1999, Lu et al., 2011, Rivera and Lloyd, 2008). Furthermore, the crystallographic structures of picornaviral 3C proteases from HRV, HAV, FMDV, and EV71 have been determined, which facilitates the identification of the active sites of these 3C proteases. The functional and structural studies of 3C or 3CL proteases have revealed that most of them are cysteine proteases and contain the chymotrypsin (two \u03b2-barrel) fold; therefore, they are also called \u201cchymotrypsin-like proteases\u201d (CHLPro) (Allaire et al., 1994, Cui et al., 2011, Gorbalenya et al., 1986, Malcolm, 1995, Matthews et al., 1994, Sweeney et al., 2007).",

In addition, the viral structure and genomic organization of iflaviruses are quite similar to those of the viruses of the family Picornaviridae (Le Gall et al., 2008). Ectropis obliqua virus (EoV) was initially identified by our group in 2000 and was classified as a member of the Iflaviridae family in January 2010 (van Oers, 2010, Wang et al., 2004). EoV is an insect positive-strand RNA virus that leads to a lethal granulosis infection in the larvae of the tea looper (Ectropis obliqua), which is an important agricultural pest that can seriously damage tea leaves. To date, the genomic RNA of EoV has been cloned as full-length cDNA and completely sequenced. The genome of EoV consists of 9394 nucleotides (nts) excluding the poly(A) tail and contains a single large open reading frame (nt 391\u20139351) encoding a polyprotein of 2987 amino acids. In this polyprotein, structural and nonstructural proteins are located at its N- and C-terminal regions respectively, and the conservative Hel\u2013Pro\u2013Pol and CPs domains have been identified as well (\nFig. 1A) (Wang et al., 2004). In the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR), an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has been shown to play an essential role in mediating EoV cap-independent translation (Lu et al., 2007, Lu et al., 2006). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of EoV has also been identified (Lin et al., 2010). In addition to EoV, the family Iflaviridae comprises other invertebrate viruses, such as infectious flacherie virus (IFV) of the silkworm, Sacbrood virus (SBV) of the honeybee, Perina nuda virus (PnV), deformed wing virus (DWV), and Varroa destructor virus-1 (VDV-1), as well as some tentative members like slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV) and Nasonia vitripens virus (NvV) (Christian et al., 2005, van Oers, 2010).",

The putative EoV cysteine protease motif GXCG is located in the C-terminal half of the polyprotein precursor, upstream of the RdRp domain, and the putative catalytic triad of H2261, D2299, and C2383 is also conserved in EoV and other iflaviruses (Fig. 1B) (Wang et al., 2004). Despite the importance of 3C and 3CL proteases in viruses in the order Picornavirales (Le Gall et al., 2008), 3CL protease activity in iflaviruses has not been formally determined, and consequently, the molecular mechanisms of 3CL-mediated cleavage of iflaviral polyproteins have not yet been studied, which significantly limits our understanding of this new family.",

These experiments were independently repeated several times with extended reaction or exposure time, and the same results were obtained (data not shown). Interestingly, the autocatalytic processing activity of His-Pro2026\u20132492(D2299A) was much weaker than that of wild-type His-Pro2026\u20132492 (Fig. 4B, lane 4 vs. Fig. 3C, lane 3), indicating that the D2299A substitution inhibits but does not abolish the protease activity of EoV 3CL. The mutagenesis analyses of the EoV 3CL protease showed that the conserved H2261, D2299, and C2383 play critical roles in EoV 3CL protease activity and provided further confirmation of the cleavage activity of EoV 3CL.",

Therefore, we sought to determine whether EoV 3CL could intermolecularly cleave its natural substrate, the EoV polyprotein, in trans. His-tagged EoV 3CL protease (His-3CL) was bacterially expressed and purified as the functional enzyme, and the protease-defective His-3CL(C2383A) mutant was used as the negative control (\nFig. 6A). On the other hand, the purified fusion protein His-3C3D\u2032(C2383A) contains a cleavage site between the 3CL region and partial 3D-like/RdRp domain and was used as the trans-cleavage substrate. The C2383A substitution completely abolished the 3CL protease activity in the fusion protein, thereby excluding the possibility of any intramolecular cleavage. The trans-cleavage products were analyzed via 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B). After 6 h of incubation, wild-type His-3CL efficiently cleaved His-3C3D\u2032(C2383A), as the level of the 53-kDa band corresponding to both His-3CL and the trans-cleavage product His-3CL(C2383A) was increased and an additional \u223c21-kDa band corresponding to 3D\u2032 appeared (Fig. 6B, lane 4), when compared with the levels of the same reaction mix before incubation (Fig. 6B, lane 2). As expected, the reaction of the substrate with the active site mutant His-3CL(C2383A) did not exhibit any cleavage (Fig. 4B, lane 3).",

Then, we examined the effects of various divalent cations on the protease activity. To this end, the reaction was supplemented with 5 mM of HgCl2, CuCl2, MgCl2, CaCl2, or ZnCl2.

We also observed that proteolytic processing efficiency was higher at the C-terminal site Q/S than at the N-terminal site E/A. In the cleavage assay, the C-terminal (Q/S) cleavage products were obviously much more prominent than the N-terminal (E/A) cleavage products (Figs. 2B and 5); likewise, in the trans-cleavage assay, cleavage in Q/S was more effective than in E/A (Fig. 6C, lane 4). Consistently, most 3C and 3C-like proteases appear to prefer glutamine (Q) to glutamic acid (E) for cleavage (Palmenberg, 1990). The specificity for glutamine has been attributed to the ability of the carboxamide group of the glutamine to form hydrogen bonds with two conserved amino acids (threonine, histidine) in the substrate binding pocket of 3C and 3CL proteases (Matthews et al., 1994).",

In contrast, the 3CL proteases of mouse hepatitis virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are insensitive to 100\u2013500 mM of Na+ (Seybert et al., 1997, Xu et al., 2010). Moreover, the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ did not visibly affect the proteolytic activity of EoV 3CL. In addition, we found that the optimal pH for EoV 3CL is about 7.5 rather than the acidic pH we previously expected based on the physiological environment in insect cells. These biochemical features suggest that the EoV 3CL protease is localized and functions in a limited environment such as an intracellular organelle within infected cells. Moreover, instead of the optimal temperature of 27 \u00b0C for insect cell culture, the optimal temperature for the protease activity of EoV 3CL is around 22 \u00b0C, which corresponds well to the appropriate environments for the growth of the natural host of EoV, the tea looper (Ectropis oblique, 20\u201324 \u00b0C). In nature, the growth and reproduction of tea loopers are greatly affected by various meteorologic factors, and the temperature is one of the most important factors (Xue et al., 2009).",

The standard errors of the means of results from three independent experiments are shown.",
