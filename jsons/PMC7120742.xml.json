First, while there are many studies that analyze airline efficiency or productivityfor specific routes, destinations or countries, there are only few studies which look at the overall population of major airlines from countries around the world. Second, there are few studies that link competitiveness in both production and cost, and jointly investigate the two as complementary. Looking at both sides of efficiency will improve the scope of interpretation by appropriately addressing the issue of the efficiency in airlines, while simultaneously reflecting on the ongoing process of airlines\u2019 entry and exit from the highly evolving and competitive market. Such an approach is less likely to make a biased estimation on the global competitiveness of airlines. Third, this study uses up-to-date estimation methods and long time series of individual airlinescovering substantial numbers of airlines from each region of the world including the Asian region, where there have been relatively fewer studies. Each of these three contributions is valuable in its own right, and we hope collectively they will make a valuable contribution to the literature by providing a clear picture of the performance and strategic decision-making of the industry.",
