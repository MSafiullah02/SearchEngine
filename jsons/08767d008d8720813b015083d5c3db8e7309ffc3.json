Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%-11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients. Conclusions. The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 hours of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

(1) Clinical manifestations are absent or mild in a substantial proportion of subjects who test positive for SARS-CoV2. Bilateral pneumonia is the main finding in hospitalized patients and at least 5% initially present in serious condition, requiring advanced medical support or intensive care. (1, 2) Bilateral pneumonia, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation activation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure have been described as key features of severe COVID-19. (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) Signs of myocardial injury are present in at least one quarter of severe cases. (2, 9) It has been postulated that the high mortality observed among COVID-19 patients may be partly due to unrecognized pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary in situ thrombosis. Estimates of the risk of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic complications are still preliminary and depend on local diagnostic and pharmacological preventive strategies. (10, 11) Better understanding of COVID-19-related thromboembolic risk will help to optimize diagnostic strategies and guide the design and conduction of randomized controlled trials on VTE prevention.

Our results indicate that thromboembolic complications may represent an integrating part of the clinical picture of COVID-19 and be already present at the time of initial hospital admission. Their incidence, however, may have been highly underestimated due to the paucity of specific imaging tests performed. It remains unclear whether increased intensity of thrombosis prophylaxis in selected patients may provide clinical benefit. Interventional and management trials should be conducted to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombotic complications in these patients. coagulation and cardiac biomarkers have been described to be elevated in COVID-19 patients: they reflect an inflammatory status characterized by coagulation activation and endothelial dysfunction, and are predictors of death.(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)9) We showed that, despite the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis, the rate of venous and arterial thromboembolic complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was remarkable, approximately 8%.Indeed, this already high figure may represent an underestimation of the actual values. We postulate this based on four key findings: (i) VTE was actively searched in only 10% of COVID-19 patients, (ii) one third of VTE imaging tests were positive, (iii) more than half of venous or arterial thromboembolic events were diagnosed within the first 24 hours of hospital admission, representing often the first manifestation of COVID-19, (iv) the vast majority of PE events was \"unquestionable\" from a radiological/anatomical perspective.The observed rate of thrombotic events is in line with recent preliminary analyses, although the severity of patients and the use of thromboprophylaxis were heterogeneous and may have influenced the estimates. In a recent Dutch paper, symptomatic VTE was diagnosed in 28 (15% of total; cumulative rate 27%) of 184 patients receiving thromboprophylaxis during intensive care and mainly consisted of PE (n=25).(10) In the Dutch study, only a minority of patients experienced arterial thrombotic events (n=3).",

A recent analysis from a French group showed that the rate of thromboembolic complications in 150 COVID-19 patients with ARDS was much higher (11.7%) than what observed in a historical control group of non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (2.1%) despite anticoagulation.(16)We showed that the majority of thrombotic complications were venous and primary represented by (isolated) PE. Consistently, the proportion of positive CTPA out of total (33%) appeared higher than that of positive CUS (21%) out of total CUS performed. As indirect as this evidence is, one may postulate that in case of suspected PE, the execution of CUS may not necessarily add useful information and delay CTPA testing. It has been suggested that the use of higher prophylaxis dosages may improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.(10, 17)The results of our analysis suggest that a lower threshold of suspicion to perform VTE imaging tests may be reasonable, even upon admission or in the very early phases of COVID-19. We observed at least half of thromboembolic events were diagnosed within the first 24 hours of admission and, therefore, not preventable by inhospital thromboprophylaxis, which would have been otherwise inadequately dosed in the presence of acute VTE.Routine thromboprophylaxis is not recommended in ambulatory patients with acute medical illness or respiratory symptoms.(18) It has been postulated that the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin during the earlier phases of SARS-CoV2 infection may exert a positive effect not only in terms of thrombosis prevention, but also reducing systemic and pulmonary inflammation, and limiting viral invasion.(7, 17,(19)(20)(21) In several country, a number of patients is being managed on an ambulatory basis, also for logistical reasons.",
