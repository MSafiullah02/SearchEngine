These tasks require methods to characterise the information contained in these sequences with a view to compare and contrast different sequences to determine their functions and place in the biological domain. The symbolic DNA sequence representation has been the legacy mainstay of such analyses carried over from the oligonucleotide sequence days, falling far short of the requirements of the broad sweeping overview of local and global base distributions, multiple sequence similarities and dissimilarities, molecular evolution and other studies necessary for an overarching assessment of the relationship of any DNA/RNA sequence to the biome through the accumulated data in the nucleic acid databases.",

However, in the conventional methods, the time complexity of sequence alignment varies as ~O(l\n2) for two sequence segments of length l (Kobori and Mizuta 2015). In the realm of genomic sequences, this clearly consumes an enormous amount of computation time, which grows even worse when multiple alignments are necessary. The reason behind such sequence alignment is the fact that mutational changes in nucleic acid sequences through individual nucleotide mutations and rearrangements in nucleotide distributions brought on by various biological processes are reflected in the DNA/RNA sequences we observe today. This constitutes one of the main considerations facing biologists trying to understand the variations between different sequences of the same genera and their evolution (Qi et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Numerical characterisation of the DNA/RNA sequences is one of the main tools in undertaking this task, and a number of methods were developed to analyse specific attributes of DNA sequences. For example, the dot plot (Gibbs and McIntyre 1970) is used to visualise identical sequence segments between two proteins by the diagonal runs in a matrix of the constituents of the two sequences. Needleman and Wunsch (1970) used dynamic programming techniques to align protein or nucleotide sequences; another dynamic programming scheme was later proposed by Smith and Waterman (1981) (Smith et al. 1985), for improved scoring local sequence alignment, but the computational complexity and time requirements have limited its use. For protein secondary structure prediction, Chou and Fasman (1974a, b) developed an empirical technique, which, however, has been superseded by new machine learning techniques. In particular, dynamic programming techniques that analyse DNA sequences in terms of discrete small segments to eventually merge into the full sequence require time commitments of ~O(l\nk), where k is the number of sequences to be aligned and is expensive in the use of computing resources, whereas fast Fourier transform (FFT) requiring resource time of ~O(l log l) is only slightly better (Hanson, thesis 2003). Multiple alignment fast Fourier transform (MAFFT) with a simplified scoring system to reduce the computational overhead (Katoh et al. 2002), discrete Fourier transforms (Yin et al. 2014) and wavelet transforms (Dodin et al. 2000) that displays regularity in patterns in DNA sequences have been some of the other methods deployed to extraction of information of interest from the DNA databanks. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is one of the most popular search tools for local alignments; it uses a heuristic algorithm that takes shortcuts to identify, very rapidly, sequences in a library that most closely resemble the query sequence (Altschul et al. 1990, 1997).",

The basic procedure in all these methods is to identify a vector with each type of nucleotide and plot each vector successively until the end of the sequence, thus drawing out a trajectory in the space of the model; associating a numerical value with the curve results in a descriptor of the sequence. This allows for quantitative comparisons between sequences and forms a powerful tool for analysis of similarities and dissimilarities between genes on a local and global scale. These novel approaches dispense with the need for alignments, which, for large sequences, become less reliable due to divergence of species and subsequent rearrangements (e.g. reversal, transposition or block exchange) occurring over evolutionary time scales; corrections introduced to take care of these divergences depend upon significant homologies between the sequences and the genes to be compared and thus become restrictive (Qi et al. 2011).",

(2008) to compare the chromosomal DNAs of human and mouse to find several examples of palindromic runs in almost the same manner in the two species. Wiesner and Wiesnerova (2010), in an innovative application of 2D graphical techniques to multiallelic marker loci from Begonia x tuberhybrida Voss, suggested that the DNA walks could be correlated with genetic diversity to predict new allele-rich loci and improve new DNA germplasm identificators. Applications of the graphical representation and numerical characterisation techniques were made by Liao and his group (Liao et al. 2005, 2006) to analyse the genomic sequences of the viruses in SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic of 2003 and generate their phylogenetic relationship tree. Humberto Gonzalez-Diaz and his group applied the underlying concepts in an analysis of protein sequences for drug discovery research through numerical parameters analogously to quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) topological indices (Estrada and Uriarte 2001; Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al. 2007), determination of mass spectral data of proteins, toxicoproteomics, toxicity prediction and diagnosis of cancer patients (Cruz-Monteagudo et al. 2008; Gonzalez-Diaz et al. 2008a, b; Aguero-Chapin et al. 2009).",

Li et al.

It will be seen that some of the issues related to vaccine design and drug discovery are more easily and readily approached using graphical techniques, and these approaches with their visual representations also give fresh insights into base distribution and composition characteristics. These have led to determination of vaccine targets in the virions, tracking viral progress across geographical and time boundaries, computation of phylogenetic relationships and possible regulation of base composition and distribution in DNA/RNA sequences. Brief discussions of these applications and methods of surveillance of viral developments and progress are covered in another section of this chapter.",

A graph invariant is a graph-theoretic property which is preserved by isomorphic graph (Harary 1969; Jane\u017ei\u010d et al. 2007). A graph \ud835\udc3a is defined as an ordered pair consisting of two sets, \ud835\udc49 and \ud835\udc3a=(\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc3a), \ud835\udc45), where \ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc3a) represents a finite nonempty set of points and \ud835\udc45 is a binary relation defined on the set \ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc3a). The elements of \ud835\udc49 are called vertices, and the elements of \ud835\udc45 also symbolised by \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc3a) or \ud835\udc38 are called edges. Such an abstract graph is commonly visualised by representing elements of \ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc3a) as points and by connecting each pair (\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63) of elements of \ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc3a) with a line or edge if and only if (\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63)\u03f5 R. The vertex, \ud835\udc63, and edge, \ud835\udc52, are incident with each other, as are \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc52. Two vertices in \ud835\udc3a are called adjacent if (\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63)\u03f5 R, i.e. they are connected by an edge. A walk of a graph is a sequence beginning and ending with vertices in which vertices and edges alternate and each edge is incident with vertices immediately preceding and following it. A walk of the form v\n0, e\n1, v\n1, e\n2, \u2026, v\nn joins vertices v\n0 and v\nn. The length of a walk is the number of edges in the walk. A graph G is connected if every pair of its vertices is connected by a path. The distance (\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63) between vertices \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc63 in G is the length of the shortest path connecting \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc63.",

Each matrix element is calculated as follows: Taking the (1,6) element, i.e. the first base A to the sixth base C as an example, the Euclidian distance is calculated from the coordinates shown in Table 9.15 and is divided by the minimum distance between two consecutive points which is \u221a3. The division by the minimum distance is performed in order to normalise the distance scale, so that the Euclidian distance between adjacent vertices equals 1 and not \u221a3 (due to taking the side of the cube to be 1). Now this value is divided by the number of edges before the sixth base, i.e. 5 here. Thus, the value obtained is = (\u221a3/\u221a3)/5 = 0.200 (Table 9.16).\n\n",

Some of the result sets had to be trimmed to accommodate in the list. Brief descriptions are given below for the results listed of some of the methods to understand the computation.\nYao-Nan-Wang plot (section \u201cYu-Hua Yao, Xu-Ying Nan and Tian-Ming Wang plot\u201d): Three curves had been proposed as part of this method (i.e. RY, MK and WS). Ideally each curve is described by a 3D vector (of \u03b8, gR and \u03c1), among which only the results for the WS curve have been listed.\nLi-Ji plot (section \u201cLi and Ji TB curve\u201d): The method proposes three curves the same as in Yao-Nan-Wang one. Only the leading eigenvalues for the L/L matrices corresponding to the RY family are shown in here.\nZhao-Qi-Yang plot (section \u201cZhao Qi Yang 2D plot (based on nucleotide triplets)\u201d): The method proposes a 21-dimensional vector, of which the 0th set, given no weight, always ends up with a value of zero. Thus, it can be considered as a 20-dimensional vector, effectively. Values for only positions 1st, 2nd, 19th and 20th are listed for representational purpose.\nLi et al. plot (section \u201cLi et al. 3D plot\u201d): This method prescribes a unique descriptor using \u2018piecewise function\u2019. It depends mainly on the average number of bases per sequence in a given dataset (in our case, this is 440.25) and a factor \u2018k\u2019 (logarithmically dependent on the aforementioned \u2018average\u2019 factor, which is ~4 in our case,). As per the proposed representation, the length of the representative vectors for our dataset would have been 12 for each sequence. Hence, for the sake of simplicity and a biting space crunch in hand, we did away with the critical representation and presented the endpoints of the prescribed 3D curve as a numerical descriptor for each sequence instead (Table 9.19).\n\n\n",

In contrast to that of nucleic acid sequences, graphical representation of protein sequences is complicated, given there are 20 amino acid residues as the basic units of proteins, while nucleic acids can be defined by only 4 bases. Initial efforts were made to portray the amino acids in terms of four properties so they could be represented in a 2D coordinate system like for the DNA sequences and later extended to multidimensional representations (see review Randic et al. 2011). We proceeded to simplify the representation intuitively by projecting the primary sequence in a 20-dimensional Euclidean space which can be used to understand the phylogenetic relationship, provide mutational insight and identify conserved regions for groups of proteins. We briefly mention just this one method in this chapter on nucleic acid research for completeness.",

The 20 amino acids are assigned to 20 axes in the Cartesian framework (Nandy et al. 2009); all the axes are equivalent, and the choice of association of amino acids with the axes can be made arbitrarily but once made will remain constant for the duration of the exercise. The computation starts from the origin and moves a step in the appropriate axis direction for the first amino acid in the sequence, another step in the respective axial direction for the next amino acid in the sequence and so on. Tracing the path for the occurrences of all the amino acids in the sequence in order results in a series of points in the abstract 20D space generating a 20D curve. An index for the protein sequence can be considered as a vector from the origin of the coordinate system to the endpoint of the graph. In order to eliminate the disadvantage that different distributions of the residues with the same composition in the sequences will lead to degeneracy in these vectors, the algorithm is designed to choose the characteristics of a sequence by a weighted centre of mass approach, first used for DNA sequence (Raychaudhury and Nandy 1999) and defined by:",

This was a type A H1N1 virus that brought about an onslaught of worldwide pandemic, spreading to far corners of the world, including the Arctic and isolated islands in the Pacific (Mamelund 2011). By the end of the pandemic that had come in three waves between 1918 and 1919 (Taubenberger and Morens 2006), it had reportedly killed 50\u2013100 million people (Patterson and Pyle 1991), mostly affecting the demographic age group of 20\u201340 years (Simonsen et al. 1998). During the peak of the pandemic in USA, more than 100,000 deaths were occurring in a week (Reid et al. 1999). It is interesting to note that post first infection wave, herd immunity within the population should have immunologically protected a second wave of infection in the same year. But on the contrary, the second wave drastically increased mortality rates. A key enigma, genetically, is the occurrence of the three infection waves in rapid succession within a period of 6\u201312 months: the H1N1 virus had to accumulate immense mutational changes or acquire key genetic alterations for it to become so fatal so rapidly which normally requires years of circulation within a population. However, in this case the virulence had increased over a matter of weeks (Reid et al. 1999).",

The avian strain was from wild waterfowl found in Eurasia, and the human strain originated from the H1N1 strain that was already present in the population. It is speculated that the surface proteins of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase that had adapted to humans were replaced by those found in the avian strains (Reid et al. 2004). The 1957 epidemic, \u2018Asian influenza\u2019, originated in China and resulted in two million deaths caused by the type A H2N2 virus (Pyle 1986). The Asian flu virus next underwent antigenic shift to give rise to the H3N2 virus that brought about the 1968 \u2018Hong Kong influenza\u2019 epidemic; in a report one million people died from the viral infection (Knobler et al. 2005). Towards the end of the century, in 1996, H5N1 virus was identified in China in geese which subsequently jumped the species barrier to infect poultry; some humans were incidentally infected in the 1997 wave and caused serious concern of another pandemic (De Jong et al. 1997). In the next few years, the H5N1 avian flu spread across various countries around the world and millions of wild as well as poultry deaths were seen. Human deaths arising from this avian influenza through physical contact were recorded globally till early 2014, but till date no human-to-human transmission has been observed, fortunately.",

In 2014\u20132015, the poultry industry in the USA was faced by an epidemic of H5N2 bird flu that is believed to have been a reassortment with Asian H5 and North American N2 proteins, which could mutate to a human-infecting pandemic although no human infection has been noticed to date (Nandy and Basak 2015). In 2017\u20132018, flu season in the USA, an H3N2 type A influenza epidemic has affected thousands of people and led to the death of around 140 children, once again underlining the high pathogenicity of the influenza virus.",

Although, IDV has been found to infect cattle (Hause et al. 2014; WHO 2018a, b), its detection in swine has raised the possibility of its spread in other mammals, including humans. Wild aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of the influenza A virus. The bird flu scare of around 1997\u20132005 was noteworthy because of the rapidity with which the virus spread throughout the globe causing huge fatalities among birds and animals; it still continues to precipitate frequent outbreaks.

The terminal sialic acid residues of the human cell receptors, where the HA binds, are of two types, \u03b1-2-3 linked and \u03b1-2-6 linked, having differential distribution in the lower and upper respiratory tract of humans, respectively (Kumlin et al. 2008). Distribution of the \u03b1-2-3-linked and \u03b1-2-6-linked sialic acid receptors in swine respiratory tract is much more uniform. In contrast, birds have only \u03b1-2-3-linked sialic acid receptor in their respiratory tract. This atypical distribution of sialic-linked glycoprotein receptors in the animal kingdom plays a significant role in evolution and dissemination of the virus. In China and the Far East, where poultry and swine herds are raised in numerous villages and farms, avian influenza with \u03b1-2-3-linked sialic acid receptors can infect swine and develop the ability to bind \u03b1-2-6-linked sialic acid receptors. This enables the modified virus to infect humans in the upper respiratory tract and make transmission between humans easy through sneezing and coughing. The scare with the bird flu, H5N1, was for this particular possibility \u2013 the virus has a high mortality ratio but to date can infect humans only through the \u03b1-2-3-linked sialic acid receptors. Were it to develop the ability to bind the \u03b1-2-6 linked sialic acid receptors, humans would be susceptible to a pandemic catastrophe.",

The enzyme required for influenza gene replication in the host cell, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is devoid of any proofreading activity, which allows mutations during replication to be retained. Mutational changes in IAV are known to proceed by two well-documented mechanisms, antigenic drift and antigenic shift (CDC 2017b). Antigenic drifts arise out of random point mutations. If they occur in the viral antigenic site, the host cell may lose immunity against the virus, and the infection-immunity response cycle starts all over again. These drifts can cause seasonal outbreaks or epidemics, but they are not potent enough to give rise to pandemics. Antigenic shifts are less recurrent, occurring only when two or more virus subtypes infect a host cell. As the virus has segmented genome, the progeny virus may pack genes from different subtypes in a process known as reassortment. This may give rise to new and unique subtypes, sometimes introducing novel surface-exposed HA or NA that may predispose the viral host to high degree of pathogenesis. Antigenic shifts are often the causes of pandemics.",

Similarly, the H7N9 avian flu that struck China in 2013 (Gao et al. 2013) was a reassorted virus, picking up genes from multiple hosts like HA genes from H7N3 virus of domestic duck, NA from H7N9 virus of wild migratory birds and six other genes from the H9N2 virus of domestic poultry (CDC 2013; Liu et al. 2013).

If a host cell is coinfected by two different strains of the same subtypes, the RNA polymerase may jump during replication from one RNA segment to its counterpart on the other strain at a consensus sequence of the gene referred to as a break point, continue replication and then revert to the original strain at the next break point. This phenomenon is termed as copy-choice recombination. This can give rise to progeny virus having a novel RNA segment not present in either of the infecting strains. We have also considered the possibility of the natural division of distinct segments of a gene, such as HA1 and HA2 of HA as break points, a topic we discuss in some detail later. Recombination in viruses is a controversial subject where the incidence of recombination through copy-choice method is expected to be below 2% (Hao 2011; Boni et al. 2012). However, a mechanism where whole segments of a gene are exchanged between two strains of the same subtype by polymerase jumps has occurred in about 5% of the cases examined (De and Nandy 2015).",

Assuming that mutational changes in the sequences will be quantified by estimates of the graph radii, g\nR, in a 2D graphical representation model (Nandy 1994), we assembled a database of 173 neuraminidase sequences for the years 1996\u20132005 and computed the average g\nR values separately over periods when the flu was highly pathogenic to humans (1996\u20131997 and 2003\u20132005) and when less pathogenic (1998\u20132002). We found from computations of the g\nR that, e.g. an H5N1 neuraminidase A/Chicken/Hong Kong/220/97(H5N1) had a very close similarity to another NA sequence from the same year, A/HongKong/156/97(H5N1), a result that matched with a conventional phylogenetic study by Suarez et al. (1998), whereas comparison with A/chicken/China/1/02-(H5N1)NA 5 years later showed that the two sequences were dissimilar almost seven times as much as the dissimilarity between the previous two sequences as estimated through \u0394g\nR. This provides a descriptor-based insight into how rapidly the virus mutates over the years. A more detailed analysis with the g\nR of the individual segments showed that the g\nR expanded in the years of high pathogenicity to humans, more so for the period 2003\u20132005, whereas the period of low pathogenicity showed reduced values of g\nR. This indicates a relative increase in the A, T component of the neuraminidase gene sequences in the pathogenic years, which could be a contributor to the high pathogenicity observed (Nandy et al. 2007).",

Studying a group of 682 strains of the H5N1 virus over the years 1997\u20132008 (Ghosh et al. 2009), we came across an interesting phenomenon: How far a strain had travelled geographically and temporally. Considering the property that the same g\nR of two sequences implies very close similarity of sequences (Nandy and Nandy 2003), we found that identical sequences have appeared over significant distances in space and time, raising questions about a virus\u2019 longevity. Based on the statistics, we found it compelling to hypothesise that virions could probably survive ex vivo (Ghosh et al. 2009, but also see Bean et al. 1982) in dried mud or dirt carried over long distances by wild birds to infect other birds and poultry in wetlands in distant areas.",

The role of recombination in viral sequence changes is hotly debated (Hao 2011; Boni et al. 2012), the general opinion being that if recombination does take place in RNA viruses at all through the copy-choice method, it would be below 2%. We enquired into the possibility of another style of recombination, complete segments of a gene being exchanged through polymerase jumps at the segment boundaries: the neuraminidase gene with three segments \u2013 transmembrane, stalk and body \u2013 is a good example. Taking A/chicken/Afghanistan/1573\u201365/2006(H5N1)NA as a test case (Ghosh et al. 2009) and computing g\nR values for the three segments individually, we compared each segment with corresponding segments of a selected group of H5N1 neuraminidase genes in terms of the g\nR values. We found that the g\nR value for the transmembrane segment of this strain was identical, for example, with the g\nR value of the transmembrane segment of A/turkey/Islamabad/NARC7873/2007(H5N1)NA, i.e. they have the exact same sequence, implying a segment exchange had taken place at some time. Similarly, the stalk segment was found identical in the test sample and in A/greatcrestedgrebe/Denmark/ 7498/06(H5N1)NA, and the body was found to have been duplicated in A/turkey/Islamabad-Pakistan/NARC-7871/02/2007(H5N1)NA, which implies that recombination-like events through exchanges of individual segments do take place (Ghosh et al. 2009).",

Our study (De et al. 2016) involved a total of 1274 HA sequences comprised of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes from Asia over the period 2010\u20132014. In this database we searched for sets of three strains where a HA1 from one strain and a HA2 from a different strain would combine to form a third, daughter strain (see schematic, Fig. 9.11). This was easily accomplished by computing g\nR values for each segment for all the strains and comparing to find duplicates, with the proviso that the two parental strains were from the same time and place. We found a total of 73 daughter strains, but, interestingly, there were no exchanges between different subtypes of the hemagglutinin. The daughter strains comprised 16 out of 427 H1 subtype, 30 of 408 H3 subtype, 20 of 350 H5 subtype and 7 of 89 H7 subtype in our database totalling 5.73% of all the strains in the database. Extending the analysis to 102 new strains from 2015 yielded another 5 instances of segment-wise recombination-like events. Thus, while the evidence for copy-choice recombination event mosaic in any gene sequence may not be readily evident, segment-wise recombination-like events do appear to occur in around 5% instances.\n",

There was also an observation that the influenza over the years had shown only a few subtypes instead of large numbers possible from the existence of 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes. Clearly, there was some interdependence between the two proteins, but there was no idea of what and how strong the interdependence could be. We undertook a study through graphical representation method (Nandy et al. 2014) and hypothesised a coupling between the HA and NA nucleotide sequences which could be measured through the g\nR values. We assumed that subtypes that exist would have strong coupling and subtypes that are not found in nature would be weakly coupled, i.e. their interdependence would be weak, and hence those strains would not survive in nature. Our results (Nandy et al. 2014) amply bore this out and in fact showed that the couplings were stronger for avian flus compared to human-infecting flus, which one would have expected since wild birds seem to be the reservoir of influenza viruses of different kinds. We carried this analysis further and forecast the effects of possible reassortments of the H5N2 virus affecting poultry in the USA for therapeutic development and surveillance purposes (Nandy and Basak 2015).",

One particularly important query is identifying conserved segments in any gene sequence. By scanning the relevant sequences through a window of the appropriate size and determining the number of instances where the g\nR values remain identical, the best conserved segments of a gene sequence can be identified. Correspondingly, taking the protein sequence and computing the p\nR values in the 20D model (see Sect. 9.2.3.2), the conserved domains in the protein can be identified. These techniques are an important tool in rational design of peptide vaccines where we may target those peptides that are conserved and have the capability of appropriate immune response to be the basis for vaccines that can outlive several generations of mutational changes. We had followed this procedure to identify best target sites in the NA of H5N1 (Ghosh et al. 2010) and the HA of H7N9 (Sarkar et al. 2015) influenza subtypes.

With influenza there are so many different strains that finding a traditional vaccine against all types poses a perennial problem. Based on global surveillance data generated by WHO\u2019s in-house surveillance system, viz. the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), vaccine strains are chosen for every year on the basis of preponderance of viral strains in each hemisphere. At present, for 2017\u20132018, WHO recommended four A and B strains, viz. A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2)-like virus, B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage) and B/Phuket/3073-like virus (Yamagata lineage), to be used as quadrivalent vaccine in the northern hemisphere (WHO 2017). The CDC also recommends vaccines for a year based on their assessment of prevailing virus strains in the previous year. While these do reduce the scope of the infection, in some years the vaccine is only partly effective as in 2014\u20132015 season and again in the current year, i.e. 2017\u20132018. These are partly due to the continuing mutations in the viral strains and partly errors in the vaccine as is reported to have happened this year.",

There have been claims off and on of a universal flu vaccine, but to date no such vaccine has been marketed. We undertook a graphical and numerical analyses of 514 strains of the H5N1 and 425 strains of the H1N1 influenza virus neuraminidase gene and determined six regions which remained conserved (Ghosh et al. 2010). This was facilitated by our examination of the graphical representation of the neuraminidase gene sequence which showed a strongly conserved 50/51 base (17 aa) region near the 3\u2032 end of the gene. When examined in the 3D crystallographic structure of the protein, this region was seen to be responsible for the bonding between the adjacent proteins in the neuraminidase quaternary structure and therefore extremely important for the structure\u2019s stability. The other regions we identified as being conserved also turned out to be surface exposed. These observations indicated a possibility, albeit subject to experimental verification, of designing inhibitors for broad-spectrum pandemic control of flu viruses with similar NA structure that could remain active for many generations of mutations of the underlying neuraminidase gene sequences (Ghosh et al. 2010). In another exercise, we explored the HA protein of H7N9 influenza virus using an improved protocol since there were concerns that the H7N9 could mutate to a human-infecting virus. We determined several targets in both the HA1 and HA2 regions of the hemagglutinin that could be used for rational design of peptide vaccines (Sarkar et al. 2015). It is to be noted that the HA1 of the hemagglutinin is highly variable, but HA2 is comparatively much more stable and is one of the targeted regions for a universal flu vaccine.",

Some of the methods employed in viral discovery and analysis include tissue culture studies, immunohistochemical assays, singleplex and multiplex assays, serology and high-throughput sequencing (Lipkin and Firth 2013). One of the primary applications of disease surveillance and analysis is in the development of drugs and vaccines. The antigenic differences in the existing vaccine and the viral strains in circulation call for the synthesis of appropriate vaccine compositions to establish renewed immunity in the host population against epidemic- and pandemic-causing viruses (Smith et al. 2004). For surveillance of influenza, the Influenza Division at CDC collects specimens from over one million patients USA-wide which then follows a protocol for testing of the patient samples in various laboratories, followed by gene sequencing on approximately 6000 influenza viruses annually. Out of the pool of 6000 viruses, antigenic compositions are analysed in 2000 of them. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is used to identify the subtype of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of a new influenza isolate on the basis of inhibition of hemagglutination by subtype-specific antibodies (Pedersen 2014). About 50 virus variants are filtered annually for potential vaccine production.",

A study (De et al. 2016) of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H1N1, H5N1, H3N2 and H7N9 subtypes from Asia, spanning the years from 2010 to 2014, showed that there were homologous recombinations of whole segments between the same subtypes. Some instances indicated that the parental and progeny strains were from same geographic regions, while others showed unexpected regional disparity, for example, parental H1N1 strains were found to be from Kowloon and Guangdong in China, and the daughter strain was isolated in Singapore. These genomic trails can be used to glean movement patterns of pathogenic viruses. In another study (Ghosh et al. 2009), it was found that H5N1 strains in geese from Qinghai, China, were also observed 5000 km away in strains in swans from Southern Russia in 2005; H5N1 strains were detected in poultry in Turkey that were also observed in chicken in Israel, via the trade route; and the same H5N1 strain were found in Egypt and Ghana, while H5N1 samples collected in 2006 from ducks in Hunan had the same sequence as found in human samples isolated from Indonesia.",

Furthermore, an application that has come into prominence is the use of millions of data available from the social media platforms on the World Wide Web. However, the risk of inaccuracy in predictive analysis based on such data is high. A wide margin of error is required to compensate for over- or underestimation. Google Flu Trends, which is the recent surveillance tracking arm of the search engine giant, came into the spotlight for over-calculating the doctor visits for influenza-like illness than the reports generated by CDC which relies on records procured from laboratories (Lazer et al. 2014). The idea was to correlate search criteria with flu incidence and establish a trend. The initial trials matched 50 million searches with 1152 data points (Ginsberg et al. 2009) and came out with erroneous results due to certain ad hoc procedures. Even after corrections to the programmes, GFT persistently overestimated flu prevalence and has been relegated to the background for now in favour of more traditional procedures as adopted, for example, by CDC. Ideally, perhaps a combination of the two approaches could auger for better predictive trend analyses.",

            "text": "With any scientific research, one must take into account the ethical implications of their work and inferences. A bone of contention in the prevention of spread of avian influenza and possible epidemics in human population is the recent trend in culling of poultry birds suspected to be infected by the H5N1 and H7N9 avian flu. The ethical dilemma arises between the prices of avian life against human population safety. Furthermore, WHO sheds light on the risks which the healthcare professionals place themselves in and also illuminates on the extent of travel restrictions that can be imposed in order to mitigate the spread of disease and the individual rights to freedom of movement. In 2006, WHO published a manual to integrate ethics with the influenza pandemic response structure (WHO 2007). The guide advocates sharing of surveillance information across borders during the pandemic, as well as prior and post pandemic. Resnik (2013) talks about the dilemma faced with the morality of dissemination of scientific knowledge, exemplified by the two censored and redacted papers, authored by Kawaoka and Fouchier Enserink 2012). Their papers showed the conclusions of genetically inducing mutations in H5N1 that conferred onto the viruses the ability to transmit through air among ferrets in the form of respiratory water droplets. The authors asserted that similar conditions among human populations would produce similar results. The NSABB, National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, allowed revised and heavily edited versions of the papers to be published in fear of dual-use research concerns (DURC) where scientific findings can be used for catastrophic implications. The NSABB, after much deliberation, recommended the full publication of their work.",

We explained in brief some of the proposals put forward for graphical representation and numerical characterisation in various dimensionalities and mentioned some of the many applications done using these novel, alignment-free approaches. In particular, we concentrated upon several applications done through the simple and intuitive 2D graphical representation of Nandy (1994) to give an idea of how these approaches can be utilised to compare and contrast the several variants of the influenza virus, determine homologous recombinations between strains of the same influenza subtype, identify conserved segments in influenza gene sequences and design peptide vaccines. We have seen that these approaches can yield phylogenetic trees to understand the relationships between the various strains and subtypes and assist in focused surveillance to ensure advance knowledge of developments that could lead to epidemic and pandemic varieties. Graphical representation and numerical characterisation thus are very general but quantitative approaches that can be used to unravel myriad aspects of viral characteristics.",
