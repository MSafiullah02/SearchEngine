Installation of thermal scanners at the borders to detect febrile travellers entering the country was implemented, with a dedicated ambulance service to send suspected cases to the designated hospital. Health-care workers at all emergency departments, isolation wards, and intensive care units were required to wear full personal-protective equipment including N95 masks, gloves, and gowns. Each inpatient was restricted to two visitors, who had their details recorded to help with contact tracing.",

Medical and nursing student clinical postings were cancelled. Each patient could only have one visitor per day, and checkpoints were established at all hospital entrances. Movement of patients and health-care workers between hospitals was restricted, and rotations of junior doctors suspended. Medical conferences were cancelled, leave for health-care workers was curtailed, and elective surgical procedures were postponed. Hospitals restricted overseas travel for their employees, mandating quarantine or virological screening on return from countries that had reported local transmission. Additionally, travellers who had returned from Mexico were quarantined for 7 days. Schools were required to begin temperature monitoring of all students. Public health messages went out on social distancing, hand hygiene, and social responsibility. These measures were only de-escalated to DORSCON yellow on May 7, when it became apparent that the disease was not as virulent as predicted. Visitor restrictions with staff temperature surveillance and enhanced infection control in hospitals continued.",

Isolation of patients has been associated with adverse outcomes11 as has the prolonged use of personal-protective equipment by health-care workers.12, 13 The unintended consequences of resource diversion on the rest of the health-care system during SARS have been reported.14 It remains to be seen if the draconian measures taken by previously SARS-affected countries will be cost-effective in the control of pandemic influenza. There is a crucial need for well designed prospective quasiexperimental studies to evaluate these responses. These studies will form the evidence base in preparation for a pandemic of emerging infections with different degrees of virulence.",
