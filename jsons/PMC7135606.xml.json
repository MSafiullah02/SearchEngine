Airborne transmission, ie, dissemination of small droplet nuclei or particles occurring over longer distances, is also believed to occur, but this mode remains controversial and is likely far less frequent.5 Limited data are available about transmission modes for novel influenza A (H1N1), but the CDC and others report that patterns are likely similar to those of seasonal influenza but with higher transmissibility.6, 7\n",

The triage process should include specific criteria to identify suspected cases among individuals with influenza-like illness, ie, temperature greater or equal to 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) plus cough or sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than influenza. Suspected cases are then identified as any patient with influenza-like illness who has had contact with anyone with a confirmed case, travel to a region with greater than 1 confirmed case, or residence in a community with greater than 1 confirmed case. Although early in the outbreak the CDC recommended airborne precautions with N95 mask use for health care workers caring for those with suspected or confirmed cases, guidelines have since evolved. The most recent ACEP and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommendations advise droplet precautions only, with the following exceptions: for patients requiring supplemental oxygen, add private room with closed door, and in instances in which respiratory procedures are being performed (ie, intubation, nebulizer treatment, suction, sputum induction), patients should be placed in an airborne isolation room.2\n",

Rapid testing can be done at the bedside, with turnaround times of 10 to 30 minutes, but most EDs still rely on the central laboratory, resulting in turnaround times of 1 to 4 hours. An important limitation of rapid tests is their inability to distinguish between seasonal and novel influenza A (H1N1) viruses. There are also a variety of other slower but more sensitive and specific tests that require central laboratories for processing. These include direct immunofluorescence, polymerase chain reaction, serology, and viral culture.",

Not surprisingly, the majority occurred in those with chronic underlying conditions (see the table in the full CDC text for details).10 Several recent reports implicate that pregnancy and obesity are associated with increased risk of complications.15, 16 A surprising dearth of clinical prediction rules exist to aid disposition decisionmaking for those with seasonal influenza, with the exception of one that has been validated for adult patients older than 65 years.17 In that study, risk factors for hospitalization or death included increasing age, male sex, previous-year hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza, increased number of outpatient visits, and presence of pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, renal disease, dementia, stroke, or cancer. In a recent pilot study, we used influenza viral load as a surrogate to predict hospital length of stay.18 Future work is required to develop and validate clinical or biomarker prediction guidance for the novel influenza A (H1N1) infection.
