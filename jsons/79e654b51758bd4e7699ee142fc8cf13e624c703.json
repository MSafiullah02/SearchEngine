[23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Most studies have employed a healthcare worker to assist in taking measurements. Nevertheless, early evidence for unassisted visual acuity testing and subjective refraction is emerging. [28] [29] [30] [31] A validation study of a web-based refraction and visual acuity test (Easee BV Amsterdam, Netherlands) in adults (aged 18-40 years) showed excellent agreement with conventional subjective refraction (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.92); and did not find a significant difference in acuity measurements when compared to the ETDRS chart (p>0.05). The study was limited to a refractive range of -6 to +4D and excluded individuals with diabetes. [28] Other studies which have employed self-testing have shown less successful outcomes. Unassisted use of a smartphone-based refractor application (Netra, EyeNetra Inc., Somerville, MA, USA) in adults (aged 18-35 years, refractive range -9.25 to +0.50D) showed a significantly more median myopic overcorrection of 0.60D when compared to conventional subjective refraction. Median visual acuity estimates were also significantly lower with the app. [29] The findings echoed previous work where the same app showed absolute differences in spherical error of more than 0.50D for approximately 60% of eyes when compared to subjective refraction, and estimates of VA were also poorer (participant age range 20-90 years, refractive range \u221215.25 to 4.25D). [32] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f A more intermediary approach to visual acuity estimation was found by using remote control of the computer based COMPlog test chart (Complog Medisoft Inc, UK). [33] Measurements were obtained in adults (age range 18-51 years), both with and without the physical presence of an optometrist. No significant difference in outcomes was noted between the two approaches (p>0.05).",

Images of conjunctival hyperaemia obtained using different smartphone cameras and lighting conditions showed that although objective evaluation of images differed, clinician evaluations remained unaffected. [60] Nonetheless, it would be helpful to develop image standard references similar to those available for the posterior eye. [61] The introduction of objective image analysis software and other semi-automated image segmentation tools could then be used to further standardise practice. [62] [63] [64] However, it is hard to envisage current smartphone technology being able to detect corneal pathology such as infiltrates and neovascularisation without accessories. In addition, the palpebral conjunctiva is not visible without specialised techniques. [65] ",

The feasibility of lens fitting apps is likely to be limited by difficulties in visualising lenses, particularly soft lenses, against the non-uniform background of the ocular surface, without the magnification and illumination benefits provided by a slit lamp. The potential for future lens fitting assessment apps may be inferred from studies investigating video evaluation of lens fits. Smythe et al (2001) reported an approximate 80% agreement in fit reliability between live versus (electronically compressed) video evaluation of the RGP lens fits by ECPs, [66] although the agreement for estimation of refit parameters was slightly lower (67%). Belda-Salmer\u00f3n et al (2015) went further by comparing video evaluation of soft lens fits using objective analysis software to subjective lens evaluation by optometrists. Though, good concordance between subjective and objective approaches was reported for a range of parameters, objective analysis was deemed more reliable and sensitive. [67] 6. Summary J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f There are, of course, many other vision related apps which show promising outcomes e.g. for the assessment of manifest and latent deviations; [68] visual field screening [69] ; and contrast sensitivity.",
