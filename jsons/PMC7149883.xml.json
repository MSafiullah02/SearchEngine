Because treatment is mainly supportive and nonspecific, many animals can be managed without determination of a definitive diagnosis. Nevertheless, it is important to identify parasites and enteropathogens that require specific treatments and to identify surgical diseases (e.g., foreign bodies and intussusception).\u2022Treatment of acute diarrhea is based on rehydration therapy and dietary modification. Symptomatic therapy with antidiarrheal agents may be considered. Nonspecific or mild acute diarrhea often is self-limiting in a day or two without treatment or with restricted food intake.\n",

In extreme cases, the feces may appear oily, greasy, and pale. Hair around the perineum may also have an oily texture from contact with fatty feces.\u2022Small bowel diarrhea is generally free of grossly visible mucus or blood. When there is bleeding from a lesion in the proximal GI tract, the blood pigment becomes dark black during transit (melena). In the absence of gastric bleeding, melena generally indicates small intestinal parasitism (e.g., hookworms), infection (viral, bacterial, fungal), ulceration (e.g., drug induced), severe inflammation, or neoplasia.\n",

For long-term feeding of a home-prepared diet, recipes for balanced diets containing novel protein sources can found in veterinary nutrition text books or various reliable websites under supervision of Diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition.\u2022An alternative approach is to use a diet containing hydrolyzed proteins (oligopeptides) that may be less antigenic (e.g., Prescription Diet z/d, Hills; or HA Diet, Purina).\u2022In cases in which hypoallergenic novel protein diets have not been effective, other dietary adjustments may be beneficial as an adjunct to medical therapy for IBD. This includes fiber supplementation (psyllium, bran, canned pumpkin) of the regular diet or switching to a commercial diet enriched with fermentable fiber (e.g., beet pulp) marketed for improving colonic function and ameliorating diarrhea in animals with colitis.
