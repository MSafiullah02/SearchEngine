            "text": "Genetic and environmental factors jointly determine the susceptibility to develop MS. Collaborative efforts during the past years achieved substantial progress in identifying genetic risk factors that predispose for MS [2]. HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles of the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are the highest-risk-conferring genes for most major autoimmune diseases including MS which is particularly associated with the DRB1*1501 allele encoding HLA-DR2b. Less-robust susceptibility effects have been identified for MHC class I alleles and in non-MHC regions. The role of environmental as opposed to genetic risk factors in MS is much less well defined, despite the fact that infections have long been thought to critically contribute to disease development. In 1894, Pierre Marie, a former student of Charcot, argued strongly that infection was the cause of multiple sclerosis. He felt that infectious pathogens, or more likely combined infections, initiate MS [3]: \u201cThese gentlemen, are suppositions, and I put them before you without unreasonably insisting upon them. The one point in this discussion which I would fix in your minds is the following fact, a fact, thank God, has been well established, viz., that the cause of insular sclerosis in intimately connected with infectious diseases.\u201d More than a century later, intriguing epidemiological but weak immunological and virological evidence has resulted in a bewildering list of usual suspects including measles, rabies, scrapie-like agent, Carp agent, paramyxovirus, coronavirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, herpes zoster, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, rubella, mumps, canine distemper, Marek's Semliki forest virus, animal and human retroviruses, and human T-cell lymphoma virus type I. Almost universally, these associations have later not withstood scrutiny. Such unclarity and vagueness spurred the notion that a pathogenic role of infectious agents in MS cannot be established unless experiments provide unequivocal evidence that the postulates of Koch have been met.",

            "text": "Traditionally, microbiologists have used postulates formulated by Robert Koch and Friedrich Loeffler to demonstrate whether a particular microbe causes a specific disease: a microorganism must be (1) found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy animals; a microorganism must be (2) isolated from the host with the disease and grown in pure culture; (3) the specific disease must be reproduced when a pure culture of the microbe is inoculated into a healthy susceptible host; and (4) the pathogen must be recoverable from the experimentally infected host [4]. These postulates retain historical importance, but fulfillment of all four postulates is not required to demonstrate causality, even in infectious diseases. Indeed, Koch applied these criteria in the 19th century to establish the etiology of tuberculosis, but he abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of cholera [5]. Likewise, not all individuals exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis become infected, and progression towards clinical tuberculosis is far from an inevitable consequence of infection with M. tuberculosis, since only \u223c 10% of the vast number of infected individuals actually develop clinical disease [6]. Such observations led to the development of the field of human genetics of infectious diseases and the identification of genetic traits that predispose to infection and clinical disease development [7]. The insight that clinical infectious diseases result from complex interactions between the infectious agent, the environment, and host factors rather than following a simple \u2018one organism\u2013one disease paradigm\u2019 has implications for our understanding of how infectious pathogens might trigger complex autoimmune diseases such as MS. Current data suggest that infectious agents that contribute to MS development are most likely ubiquitous and highly prevalent in the general population. Moreover, they require a permissive genetic trait that determines the susceptibility of the host to develop MS. Finally, the distinct conditions, under which primary infection with these pathogens is encountered, might further modulate disease risk. Here, we review new data for an association of certain infectious pathogens with MS and illustrate mechanisms of infection-induced immunopathologies in experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS inflammation.",

This geographic distribution can be attributed to both genetic effects and environmental influences. Arguing for the genetic hypothesis, the prevalence of MS differs strikingly between geographically close, but genetically distinct populations. Ethnic groups like Lapps in Scandinavia, Gypsies in Hungary, Maoris in New Zealand, or Aborigines in Australia are rarely or virtually not affected by MS, although the disease is otherwise common in these latitudes. Similarly, MS is rare among Japanese, Chinese, African Blacks, North and South Amerindians, and the native population in southern countries of the former Soviet Union, but occurs notably more frequently among Caucasians living in the same area. Further examples are the different prevalence rates in genetically distant populations living on the same island as it has been reported for Sardinia, Cyprus, and Ireland [8].",

As an example, first-generation immigrants from the Caribbean and Asia whose genetic susceptibility is proven by the high rates of MS among their UK-born children [17], [18] rarely develop MS themselves, suggesting that individuals born in low-risk areas appear to benefit from some long-lasting protection that is, however, not transmitted to their children [13].",

Thus, pathogens are recognized as adjuvants for the immune response against them and could, via pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated activation of APCs that contain self-antigens obtained from dying cells or tissue damage, activate autoreactive T and B cells. Alternatively, the Th1-driven environment during viral infection could facilitate activation of autoreactive bystander T and B cells via proinflammatory cytokine production. An even broader form of bystander activation is achieved by microbial superantigens, which cross-link MHC class II molecules with TCRs that contain a certain V\u03b2 domain, leading to T-cell activation independently of specific antigen recognition. Staphylococcal, mycoplasma, endogenous retrovirus-derived, and enteric microbiota-generated superantigens were suggested to be involved in the disease exacerbation in animal models of MS [19].",

Polyspecific or so-called degenerate TCR recognition is considered to represent a compromise between the need to provide host protection against virtually any pathogen-derived epitope and, at the same time, the need to ensure thymic positive selection and peripheral maintenance of this T-cell repertoire via intermediate affinity recognition of self-peptides that are presented by self-MHC molecules. Such degenerate specificity, however, also carries a certain risk for autoimmunity under special circumstances, e.g., strong innate immune activation. It has previously been shown in a number of animal models transgenic for human autoreactive T-cell receptors that microbial peptides can induce MS-like disease through mechanisms of molecular mimicry [25], [26], [27].",

For example, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) is a model of MS in which intracerebral TMEV infection of mice leads to an autoimmune demyelinating disorder 30\u201340 days after infection [33]. Persistent infection of microglial cells with TMEV has been shown to upregulate expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules and to enhance the ability of these cells to function as effective APCs [34]. Furthermore, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) immortalizes B cells and assists in their differentiation into long-lived memory B cells. These mechanisms could support the survival of autoreactive B cells or of a reservoir of APCs that can present autoantigens to promote autoimmunity [35], [36].",

            "text": "The evidence for a biological role of these mechanisms mainly stems from experimental autoimmune disease models. Testing whether these mechanisms are indeed relevant in human autoimmune diseases such as MS is challenging because og a number of reasons including the following:1.Chronic autoimmune diseases are likely to become clinically apparent only after a considerable period of subclinical autoreactivity, at which time the pathogen might have already been cleared and/or the antiviral immune responses might have subsided.2.The proposed mechanisms by which a pathogen or a number of pathogens potentially initiate and sustain MS are likely dynamic, not mutually exclusive and might occur simultaneously or sequentially. A simple \u2018one organism\u2013one disease\u2019 or \u2018one mechanism\u2013one disease\u2019 paradigm might not apply to complex and heterogeneous diseases such as MS.3.The flip side of the idea that autoimmunity is driven by viral infections is that autoreactive immune responses, or even only a predisposition to the development of these responses, might affect the ability of the host to control infections and to regulate antiviral immune responses. The latter probably accounts for the occurrence of polyspecific antiviral humoral immune responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment in patients with MS, which are characterized by intrathecal synthesis of IgG antibodies towards a variety of viruses including measles, rubella, varicella zoster virus, and the human herpesvirus 6 [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. Intrathecal humoral immune response against measles, rubella, and varicella zoster virus (MRZ reaction, MRZR) is present in 80\u2013100% of patients with MS but less common in acute inflammatory diseases of the CNS [41]. Although these alterations could potentially be used as surrogate disease markers for diagnostic purposes, there is no evidence that they contribute to the initiation and progression of CNS tissue damage in MS [42].\n",

Although many epidemiological studies link VZV to MS, a report evaluating 40 studies in the period 1965\u20131999 indicated that there is insufficient evidence to support the association of MS with varicella or zoster infections [47]. Recent studies conducted by Sotelo et al. [48] indicated the presence of VZV DNA in CSF and mononuclear blood cells of MS patients in relapse, while VZV viral particles were observed by electron microscopy in patients' CSF [49]. Conversely, another study failed to show the presence of VZV virions or DNA in the CSF or in the acute plaques of MS patients [50]. Furthermore, recombinant antibodies prepared from clonally expanded plasma cells in MS CSF, which are thought to represent the intrathecally synthesized oligoclonal IgG, did not bind to VZV-infected cells [50]. Therefore, the role of VZV in MS remains controversial, and further studies with more rigorous methodologies are required to support the environmental role of VZV as a trigger of MS.",

Other reports suggested that constitutive presence of active HHV-6 infection in glial cells in inflamed CNS tissue could result in virus-triggered immunopathologies in MS [61].",

A recent meta-analysis reviewed 14 studies, 11 case\u2013control and 3 cohort studies, which investigated the association of IM and MS. The analysis concluded that the combined relative risk for development of MS after IM was 2.3 and in HLA-DR2-positive individuals even 7 [68], indicating that symptomatic EBV infection is a risk factor for MS [69]. These observations were confirmed by Ramagopalan et al. who compared more than 14,000 MS cases and 7000 spouse controls. Their study found a positive correlation of MS disease with history of IM, while no such association was observed for history of symptomatic measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella infections, or with history of measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and influenza vaccination [70].",

While EBV-specific antibody titers were similar between cases and people who developed MS before the age of 20, a two- to threefold increase in EBV-specific antibody titers was observed in MS cases after the age of 25. The strongest risk factor, rising MS susceptibility tenfold, were increased titers of serum antibodies to EBV-derived nuclear antigens (EBNA) and, in particular, to the EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) [74], [75]. A recent study confirmed these results by reporting that EBNA1-specific antibody responses occurred 15 to 20 years before onset of symptoms in MS patients [76]. Although these observations suggest an EBV-specific immune dysregulation preceding MS onset, a limitation of the abovementioned studies is that they compared EBV-specific responses only to HCMV responses and not to those towards other viruses, suspected in MS association.",

CIS patients showed increased humoral and cellular immune responses to EBNA1 but not to other EBV-derived proteins. IgG responses to other viral antigens and frequencies of T cells specific for HCMV and influenza virus gene products were unchanged in CIS patients. Furthermore, EBNA1 was the only viral antigen with which immune responses correlated with number of clinical disability and MRI metrics during the follow-up period and increased EBNA1-specific IgG responses in CIS patients predicted conversion to clinically definite MS. Higher IgG responses to EBNA1 in patients with CIS and relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) were also reported to correlate with increased frequencies of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells [78]. In line with the results of the former study, Farrell et al. [79] found higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to EBNA1 in CIS and RRMS patients, whereas responses to lytic EBV capsid antigens, HCMV, and measles-virus encoded proteins were unchanged compared to healthy blood donors. In these patients, elevated EBNA1-specific IgG responses were associated with the development of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions and predictive for T2 lesion volume change and clinical disability for a period of 5 years [79].",

Activated CD8+ T cells were also present close to EBV-infected B-cell foci, suggesting that EBV-specific lymphocyte responses may be involved in MS immunopathologies. However, these findings could not be reproduced in several subsequent studies [84], [85], [86]. Further research should clarify the source of this discrepancy.

The two- to three-folds increased risk of developing MS among individuals with history of IM compared with subjects who acquired EBV without symptoms, the almost universal seropositivity for EBV in adults and children with MS, and the steep and monotonic increase in MS risk with increasing titers of antibodies to EBV in apparently healthy adults could suggest that EBV infection is causally linked to MS development.
