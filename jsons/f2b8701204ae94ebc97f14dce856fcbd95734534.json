SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is thought to have first transmitted from an animal host to humans in Wuhan, China in late 2019. On March 11, 2020, after the rapid increase of the cases outside China, the World Health Organization (WHO) eventually declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic (WHO 2020). As of April 25, it is officially reported that more than three million people are infected by this virus in 210 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances (Worldometer 2020) . During a pandemic with a high infection rate, prompt mitigatory actions play a crucial role in decelerating the spread and preventing the new hotspots of the disease. Though, taking immediate actions requires the capability to detect the early warning signs of the outbreak and to characterize the dynamic of the spread in a near real-time fashion. In the case of COVID-19 pandemic, delay in developing the test kits, the limited number of kits, complicated bureaucratic health care systems, and lack of transparency in data collection procedures are the major origins of postponement of effective preventive interventions and mitigatory (Washington post; Achrekar et al. 2011 ). Lai et. al. 2020 could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases would have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas (Lai et al. 2020) . To fill this gap, Epidemic Intelligence (EI) is being used to explore alternative mostly informal sources of data to gather information regarding disease activity, early warning, and infectious disease outbreak (De Quincey and Kostkova 2010) . Human activities and interactions on the web are one of these informal sources. For instance, Google Flu Trends exploits web search queries to estimate flu activity (\"Google Flu Trends\" 2012). Social media content is another powerful tool that provides invaluable crowd-sourced near realtime data for sensing health trends.",

            "text": "Based on the epidemic models, usually in the early stages of an epidemic we expect an exponential growth trend in the number of the cases of disease (Martcheva 2015) . However, it is difficult to monitor the growth trends of the infection in real-time and detect the outbreak without significant delay. This delay is often caused by the time-consuming and bureaucratic procedures of diagnosis including test development, test processing time, and reporting time (Rong et al. 2020) . In this study we examined the possibility to fill this gap by detecting the early signs of an outbreak using Twitter content. We collected tweets containing the common symptoms of COVID-19, right before and after the formal outbreak. A challenging issue in analyzing this data is to differentiate between general public concerns regarding the outbreak, and personal infection by COVID-19 to detect any anomaly in tweets' trend. To address this issue, Smith et al. 2015 , use NLP to classify flu-related tweets into two categories of personal infection tweets that express an awareness of influenza. They show the temporal trends of these two categories are very different (Smith et al. 2015) .",

On the other hand, we expect to observe exponential growth in the volume of the personal infection tweets, when an outbreak is happening in the given state, even prior to the official detection of the outbreak by formal medical procedures. Looking into the temporal trends in the Twitter data in 50 states of the US, prior to the official detection of the epidemic outbreak in any of the given states, as expected, we observe linear growth in the number of tweets following the news media reporting on the outbreak in china and later in western Europe. However, for each state there is a tipping point that happens before any official reports of the outbreak in those states where the growth trends change from linear to exponential, implying that the number of personal infection tweets not only dominate the general awareness tweets, but also define the growth behavior of the aggregate number of the tweets (implying that an outbreak is happening on top of a general awareness growth.)",

The observations of the current study, as a proof of concept, suggest that the behavioral patterns of an epidemic outbreak emerges in the temporal trends of the informal data streams like Twitter data, as an early sign of an outbreak in local level. In sum, this approach has potential to be used further as a decision support system to inform the policy makers deploying the intervention policies in a timely manner.",

We used a simple analysis of temporal trends of the relevant tweets. Our results have shown that the trend of tweets containing the common COVID-19 symptoms such as cough and fever, are highly correlated with the official CDC dataset. Although, a significant temporal lag, between 5 to 19 days, was observed between the exponential growth phase of tweets and the confirmed cases which could be related to inherent delays in the testing and diagnosis procedures. Therefore, we conclude that Twitter data provides a near real time assessment of an outbreak which can be utilized as an early warning system to increase the public awareness. It also can be used as a decision support system to inform policy maker in taking timelier mitigatory and preventive actions.",
