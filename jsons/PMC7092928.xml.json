            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, the latter often leading to hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. HCV is an enveloped RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family, with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of \u223c9.6 kb. The viral genome consists of one long open reading frame (ORF) that is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends [2], [3]. The ORF encodes a single polyprotein of 3010 amino acids that is proteolytically processed by cellular and viral proteases into at least 10 polypeptides, including structural proteins and nonstructural (NS) proteins [4]. The 65-kDa HCV NS5B protein carrying RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity is the key player in HCV RNA replication [5]. It is a compact globular protein consisting of three sub-domains called the palm, finger, and thumb, and resembles a right hand, similar to other related enzymes [6].",

            "text": "HCV core protein is a viral structural protein that packages the viral RNA genome [7]. Its binding to the 5\u2032-UTR of the HCV genome has been suggested to be important for specific encapsidation of the viral genome [8]. In addition to its roles as a structural protein, HCV core protein also displays pleiotropic functions though its interaction with cellular proteins [9], [10]. Besides its roles in virus particle assembly and in pathogenesis, HCV core protein has been postulated to be involved in regulation of HCV RNA replication. It has been suggested, based on comparison of the RNA replication level of a selectable full-length HCV replicon with that of an HCV subgenomic replicon lacking HCV core/E1/E2 structural protein expression, that the decreased level of HCV RNA in cells containing the full-length replicon might be due to the presence of viral structural proteins [11]. Consistent with this hypothesis, other groups have reported that the efficiency of colony formation by the full-length replicon is about 3\u20134 logs lower than that of subgenomic replicons [12]. In addition, the subcellular localization of core protein is likely to overlap with that of viral RdRp, since both proteins were shown to be associated with intracellular lipid-raft structures [13], [14]. Together, the results described above suggest that HCV core protein might indeed be involved in regulation of HCV RNA replication. To date, however, the precise role of core protein in HCV replication remains unknown.",

We also observed that, in cells expressing core protein, both HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES)- and cap-dependent translation are inhibited by activation of PKR (data not shown). These results underscore the contribution of core protein in the negative regulation of viral genome translation as well as in the regulation of the polymerase activity. When core protein accumulates in infected cells, both viral replication and IRES-mediated translation might be blocked to switch the HCV life cycle from viral replication to packaging of the genome and release of virions. The modulatory function of core protein in HCV replication thus may play a significant role at the late stage of infection. Alternatively, our results may suggest a novel mechanism by which HCV core protein controls the viral replication level through its interactions with the NS5B, likely for the establishment of persistent infection. In other RNA viruses, coat protein was shown to enhance or inhibit RNA replication, likely depending on expression level of coat protein [23]. Similarly, the coat protein of alfalfa mosaic virus is required for initial viral RNA infection and translation [24], but a higher concentration seems to inhibit viral replication [25]. Our results are thus consistent with the possibility that HCV core protein plays more than one role, depending on the stage of the HCV life cycle and the interaction of core protein with various viral and/or cellular proteins.",
