This study aims to report outcomes, with focus on CLD, of preterm infants managed with a bubble CPAP (b-CPAP) bundle of care. METHODS: Infants <1500 g were stratified into four groups depending on intubation status through first 3 days of life. The incidence of mortality, CLD and other morbidities were compared over four chronological epochs. Outcomes of the most recent epoch were compared to contemporaneous benchmarks from Vermont Oxford Network (VON). RESULTS: Of 773 infants (median GA = 28 weeks, average BW = 995 g), 24.5% were intubated in DR and 11.7% in the first day of life. Mechanical ventilation, bCPAP and oxygen days in survivors were 1.5, 29 and 14, respectively. Overall incidence of CLD was 6.4% that remained consistent in the four epochs (7.6%, 7.5%, 5.8% and 5%), respectively. In comparison to VON, CLD was significantly less (p < 0.001). Initial DR intubation was not associated with increased CLD compared to initial management with CPAP that required subsequent intubation. CONCLUSION: It is feasible and sustainable to administer a b-CPAP bundle of care to decrease CLD. Cluster randomized trials are needed to validate the reproducibility of this approach.",

            "text": "Chronic lung disease (CLD) continues to lead neonatal morbidities in premature infants despite surfactant discovery and the emergence of newer modalities for mechanical ventilation. 1 The use of mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation are the two major attributes to CLD. 2 The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as the primary mode of respiratory support in premature infants has recently increased. In addition to avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury, CPAP optimizes the functional residual capacity of the lungs, splints the airways and diaphragm, and stimulates lung growth; these effects have the potential to minimize the risk for CLD. 3 Multiple randomized controlled trials compared early use of CPAP to mechanical ventilation and did not show difference in the primary outcome of CLD. 4, 5 Consequently, the American Academy of Pediatrics considered it an acceptable practice to support premature infants with CPAP in the delivery room (DR) without routine intubation and surfactant administration. 6 However, when these trials were analyzed collectively in a meta-analysis, the early use of CPAP demonstrated a marginal but statistically significant decline in the composite outcome of survival without CLD. 7 As much as these trials were crucial to clarify the safety of not routinely intubating premature infants in DR, and therefore they were instrumental for the change in DR management and practice, these trials left multiple questions unanswered. Significant variations in the incidence of CLD were reported among these trials despite recruiting infants with comparable inclusion criteria and using the same definition of CLD. In addition, the majority of these trials were not able to reproduce the success previously reported in anecdotal experiences. For example, in neonatal units experienced with the use of bubble CPAP (b-CPAP), very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants were reported to have oxygen requirement at 36 weeks in 4-6% of infants with combined mortality and CLD of 13\u221217%. 8, 9 However, in randomized trials, the combined outcome of mortality and oxygen use at 36 weeks was mostly around 30% or higher. 10 Therefore, CPAP as a tool is not able to explain the wide variation in CLD among neonatal units. In fact, in a recent report, significant increase in long-term pulmonary morbidities were associated with increased use of noninvasive ventilation during infants' stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 3 We hypothesize that it is not the CPAP tool that decreases CLD; what matters the most is the bundle of care associated with the use of CPAP. The bundle would include: (a) device-related guidelines: type of facial interface, the source of delivered CPAP pressure, the timing of starting and weaning off CPAP, the method of weaning CPAP, (b) bedside skills and competencies: positioning of the infant, maintenance of patent airway, keeping nasal interface in place and maintaining sealed respiratory circuits, and (c) nonpulmonary management: early fluid management, feeding practices, nutritional goals, and transfusion practices. We therefore described the components of this bundle of care in our experience and provided the outcomes associated with this overall bundle. This study was designed to achieve two goals: (1) distinguish between the CPAP bundle of care and the CPAP device, and (2) to set the precedence of associating a respiratory bundle of care, rather than a device, with clinical outcomes. We also compared our recent outcomes using this bubble CPAP bundle with contemporaneous outcomes from Vermont Oxford network to assess the effectiveness of this bundle of care. Consequently, future trials that will use CPAP would need to specify the exact CPAP bundle and practice guidelines used to ensure uniformity among participating units.",

The population was divided into four epochs, 4 years each, in chronological order of admission. Analyses of outcomes over time were conducted to test the stability of these outcomes. The overall population was stratified into four groups depending on the status of respiratory support in the delivery room and during the first 3 days of life. These four respiratory groups were: Group 1 received CPAP in DR and continued with b-CPAP for at least 3 days; Group 2 received b-CPAP in DR but were subsequently intubated within 3 days; Group 3 were initially intubated in DR and successfully extubated within 3 days; and Group 4 were intubated in DR and remained intubated for at least 3 days.

            "text": "1. Delivery room management: Infants were not routinely intubated in the delivery room. Premature infants were allowed a chance to spontaneously breathe after tactile stimulation followed by 30 s of bag-and-mask ventilation if needed. If an infant had spontaneous breathing, he/she would be supported with CPAP using the t-piece connector (Carden valve or Neopuff, Fisher & Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand) and would be immediately transported to the NICU and supported by b-CPAP while other care elements were established such as attaching cardiac monitoring, temperature check and anthropometric measurements. 9 2. Early use of CPAP: The b-CPAP circuit was the primary type of CPAP used in the NICU. Detailed description of the circuit components was previously reported (Fig. S1 ). 11 CPAP pressure was maintained at 5 mH 2 O that could increase to 6 cmH 2 O if an infant experienced retractions or increased oxygen requirement. The facial interface was always via nasal prongs; the prongs were snuggly fitted into both nostrils. Prongs were short to allow the least resistance and curved to follow the anatomy of the nares. 3. Use of surfactant: if an infant did not have spontaneous breathing in the delivery room, he/she would be intubated. Surfactant therapy would be administered only in the presence of oxygen requirement and radiographic findings suggestive of respiratory distress syndrome. Intubated infants were extubated as soon as acidemia and hypercapnia improved and oxygen requirement (FiO 2 ) was weaned to <30%. 4. CPAP failure criteria: While supported with b-CPAP, if an infant showed signs of respiratory compromise including frequent apnea or increased oxygen requirement (FiO 2 \u2265 50%), he or she would be intubated and started on conventional mechanical ventilation. Surfactant would be administered if tracheal intubation occurred in the first 24 h of life. An infant might benefit from a trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) via nasal prongs prior to intubation if the compromise was mainly related to apnea. 5. Airway care: infants were closely monitored for patency of airway including the use of the right-sized nasal prongs and deep suctioning of the nasal and oral pharynx. Suction was applied gently every 3\u22124 h to avoid any harm to nasal mucosa. The position of the nasal prongs and respiratory circuit tubing were secured to a snug head cap to ensure the prongs do not impose any pressure or trauma on the nasal septum. An indwelling orogastric tube was used to prevent abdominal distension and evacuate gastric air during care every 3\u22124 h. A neck roll was used to maintain the neck slightly extended. The use of b-CPAP did not prohibit positioning the infant prone or on the side as long as airways were maintained patent. A checklist that included detailed b-CPAP care competencies was maintained at the bedside for the caregiver to complete each shift. Staff were trained on the application of each component of the checklist at the bedside. 6. Weaning off CPAP: Infants were supported with b-CPAP until they no longer required oxygen supplementation and breathed comfortably. In addition, those with birth weight <1000 g were maintained on b-CPAP, even if their FiO 2 requirement was 21%, until their weight was at least 1200 g and post-conceptual age was at least 32 weeks. Infants were weaned off b-CPAP directly to room air. If an infant displayed any sign of distress such as tachypnea, retraction, or oxygen desaturation, b-CPAP would be restarted and no weaning trials were attempted for 24 h. Daily weaning attempts would continue until infant was fully weaned off CPAP. Infants were not weaned to nasal cannula or any other source of oxygen or airflow. 7. Use of caffeine: Infants \u2264 26 weeks of GA were routinely started on caffeine, otherwise caffeine was administered to infants only if they were symptomatic with apnea or irregular breathing. Once started, infants were continued to receive caffeine until their post-conceptual age was close to 35 weeks and they were no longer supported with b-CPAP. A few infants might be weaned earlier when they had tachycardia or gastritis. 8. Oxygen saturation: The lower monitor alarms were set at 85%. High monitor alarms were set at 95% when FiO 2 is >21%. Oxygen saturation range was attempted at 87-93% with narrower targeted range of 90-93%. 9. Fluid and nutrition management: For infants < 1000 g, fluids were started at volume of 120 ml/kg/d and the goal might change every 8 h in response to point-of-care serum sodium concentrations. Aggressive parenteral nutrition approach was followed with protein intake of 1\u22122 g/kg/d in the first 24 h of life. Early trophic feeds were started and goal feeds of 130 Kcal/kg/d was achieved at 14-21 days of life based on BW and clinical conditions. Fluid intake for infants with BW > 1000 g were initiated at 100 ml/kg/day with less frequent electrolyte checks. 10. Transfusion practices: Infants with BW < 1000 g were managed with liberal transfusion practice attempting to maintain hematocrit \u226540% during the first week of life and \u226535% after 1 week. Infants with BW \u2265 1000 g were maintained with hematocrit \u226535% during the first week of life and \u226530% thereafter.",

The practice did not allow for a pressure higher than 6 cmH 2 O. Some studies associated the use of higher pressure (8 cmH 2 O) with a significant increase in the risk to develop pneumothorax. 5 The greater incidence of pneumothorax with the use of 8 cmH 2 O pressure could be a marker that such pressure is higher than physiologic and would be concerning to impose trauma to alveoli even in the absence of pneumothorax. The pressure used in the DR was also 5\u22126 cmH 2 O without routine bag-and-mask ventilation or sustained positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in order to avoid harm to premature lungs. Animal studies have reported that inappropriately high pressure in the DR is associated with significant lung damage even when pressure was introduced for a few breaths. 17 A recent trial on the use of sustained PEEP was discontinued due to lack of safety with potential harms with such approach. 18 The interface used in this b-CPAP bundle was a specific type of binasal prongs that are wide, short and curved to accommodate the natural nasal passages (Hudson CRI, New Jersey or Babi.Plus, Carlsbad, CA). This type of prongs can fit snuggly into nasal apertures without imposing pressure on the nasal septum. Other types of prongs that are single, longer or narrower increase airway resistance and work of breathing. The use of nasal mask can be gentler to the nasal septum; however, the inherent leak around the septum is inevitable thereby providing inefficient pressure.",

This practice guideline was initiated based on an animal study that showed increased lung growth with longer use of CPAP; the continuous distending pressure generated by CPAP was associated with increased lung volume, weight, cytoplasm and DNA contents in male ferrets after 2 weeks of therapy. This lung growth effect was not achievable after 1 week of therapy, which indicates that the stimulation of lung growth by CPAP requires time. 19 In a subsequent clinical trial, weaning off CPAP prematurely with transitioning to nasal cannula was associated with a longer duration of oxygen use when compared to continuing the use of CPAP until oxygen is no longer required. 20 A recent trial demonstrated the effect of extended use of CPAP on lung growth; premature infants that randomly received extra 2 weeks of CPAP had doubled their functional residual capacity when compared to controls. 21 The use of nasal cannula early in the course of RDS is not helpful either.

H Aly and MA Mohamed recent multicenter randomized trial. 22 One of the troubles associated with the use of nasal cannula is the lack of pressure control; studies measured a wide range of pressure (0\u221214 cmH 2 O) in the pharynx of infants supported with nasal cannula. 20 Some nasal cannula devices allow adequate heating and humidification, although many of them will display significant water rain-out that leads practitioners to use colder and less humidified gas. Relatively dry and cold gas can add to the reactivity of respiratory airway especially those with existing lung disease. 23 In addition, the bundle includes a careful attention to the patency of nasal and nasopharyngeal airway through frequent suctioning. Upper airway suctioning could be a challenging task especially in the smallest GA categories \u226424 weeks; it has to be efficient to clear all secretions, gentle not to cause any trauma, and fast to avoid apnea and oxygen desaturation. Thus, bedside training and experience are crucial for the success of the bubble CPAP bundle. Based on the above, our cohort had some infants who received b-CPAP without O 2 supplementation at 36 weeks. Based on the definition of CLD used in major randomized controlled trials and The prevalence of severe ROP was minimal in this cohort. None of the infants in the cohort received any laser or anti-VEGF therapy since 2010. The vast majority of infants received treatment for ROP prior to 2010 were those \u226424 weeks of GA and typically received mechanical ventilation early in the NICU course (data not presented). It is plausible that the ventilator-associated inflammatory cascade may contribute, in addition to CLD, to retinal injury that leads to ROP. It has been recently recognized, in animal model, that mast cell activation is responsible for the abnormal neovascularization of the retina that leads to ROP; mouse strains lacking mast cells do not develop ROP when challenged with hyperoxia. 24 Another explanation to the absence of ROP for several years could be the application of a tighter goal oxygen saturation range that possibly minimized episodes of hypoxemia.",
