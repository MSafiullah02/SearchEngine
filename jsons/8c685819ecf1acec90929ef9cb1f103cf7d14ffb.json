Responses to past pandemics are instructive on evaluating how anxiety sensitivity and disgust proneness influence broader anxiety reactions to illness risk. For example, in a college student sample (N=315) disgust sensitivity was a significant predictor of fear of contracting H1N1 (swine flu) in data collected during times of peak media attention to the pandemic in 2009 -2010 (Wheaton et al., 2012 . In a student sample (N=107) gathered during J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the peak period of concern over contracting Ebola in the United States in late 2014, the physical concerns subscale of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007) and disgust sensitivity (assessed with the Disgust Scale-Revised; DS-R, Olatunji et al., 2007) were correlated with fear of contracting the illness, although neither were significant in regression analyses (Blakey et al., 2015) . Similar findings were observed in a sample of students and other members of a university community (N=216) during the time of the Zika outbreak, in 2015-2016, where the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale and the DS-R were significantly correlated with fear of contracting the illness, but were not significant predictors in regression analyses (Blakey & Abramowitz, 2017) .",

The nature of COVID-19, with particularly significant respiratory symptoms, and respiratory failure as one of the ways in which the virus can be fatal, increases the relevance of anxiety sensitivity. Reviews of the literature have shown that a general fear of respiratory symptoms is associated with anxiety sensitivity (Horenstein, Potter, & Heimberg, 2018) . Additional research has demonstrated a significant role for disgust in health-related concerns, such as hypochondriasis (Weck, Esch, & Rohrmann, 2014) . Further, considering that recommended public health measures emphasize potential risks for contracting CoV-19 from surfaces and objects, disgust would be expected to additionally J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contribute to avoidance given its established role in contamination fear (McKay, 2017) , particularly disgust sensitivity (Olatunji, et al., 2014) .",

Disgust propensity is the extent that one is likely to experience disgust for a range of putative disgust elicitors (van Overveld et al., 2006) . These emotional experiences form a part of the behavioral immune system (BIS; discussed in Taylor, 2019) ; in short, the BIS is a system of psychological mechanisms that detect cues to the presence of infectious pathogens in the immediate environment and trigger disease-relevant emotional (e.g., fear, anxiety, disgust) and cognitive responses that promote the avoidance of disease cues (Schaller & Duncan, 2007) . Disgust propensity and sensitivity should moderate the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and COVID-19 anxiety. The rationale for a moderating relationship is that both anxiety sensitivity and disgust have health relevant components. Activation of the BIS increases the disgust salience for objects and situations that were not previously found disgusting. As pandemics such as COVID-19 arouse heightened physical monitoring, when present in conjunction with disgust propensity and sensitivity, it is expected that fear of contracting CoV-19 would be heightened.",

The depression and anxiety subscales have adequate reliability and validity (Zanon et al., in press) . We used the Chinese instrument version, validated previously (K. Wang et al., 2016) . Internal consistency (coefficient alpha) in our sample was .82 for depression, and .76 for anxiety. (CoVGAD-7) .

The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f scale uses a Likert-type frequency scale from \"0 = Not at all\" to \"3 = Nearly every day.\" Total scores are considered valid and reliable (Plummer, Manea, Trepel, & McMillan, 2016) . The measure is widely adopted, including as part of the Mental and Behavioral Health Registry of the American Psychological Association (Wright et al., in press) . We used the Chinese version, validated by He, Li, Qian, Cui, and Wu (2010) . We tailored instructions to inquire about COVID-19 anxiety, asking \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems because of the Coronavirus outbreak?\" The internal consistency for the present sample was .90.",

As individual participants were not interviewed, more detailed evaluations of specific manifestations of the emotional reactions to COVID-19 could be examined. This limitation emerged from active quarantine conditions, and hence in-person questionnaire administration or interviews could not be conducted. Additionally, it is possible that participants self-selected based on their concerns over COVID-19, and thus may not be fully representative of the population affected, such as through J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f quarantine or other closures, by the pandemic. Further, as these data are crosssectional in nature, we cannot make causal statements regarding the relationship among the study variables. It is expected that the findings from this study can be used as a basis for future investigations either as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, or future pandemics. For example, interview based examinations could further probe the relationship among the variables here, and additional evaluate factors underlying the BIS. Pre-existing concerns with pathogens might be also further evaluated for it's potential role in activating the BIS and contributing the relationships identified in this study. Prior research has suggested that obsessive-compulsive symptoms may play a role in anxiety sensitivity when considered in the context of prior pandemic fears (i.e., H1N1; Brand et al., 2013) and thus may serve as an additional focus of investigation.",

The total model when examining the predictive value of the ASI-3 physical concerns and DPSS-R propensity was F(6,901)=151.98, p<.001, with Adjusted R 2 change=0.50.

The total model when examining the predictive value of the ASI-3 physical concerns and DPSS-R sensitivity was F(6,901)=153.97 p<.001, with Adjusted R 2 change=0.51.

As the hypothesis centered J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f on the physical concerns subscale of the ASI-3 in conjunction with either the propensity or sensitivity subscales of the DPSS-R, the same pattern of significance was found for the cognitive concerns and social concerns subscales of the ASI-3.
