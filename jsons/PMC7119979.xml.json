Tropical climate is characterized by high ambient temperature; some tropical regions receive heavy rains, while others get little precipitation. The rainy tropical ecosystem promotes the survival of pathogenic microorganisms outside the human host and is suitable for proliferation of parasites and vermin that cause disease or act as reservoirs, intermediate hosts, and vectors. On the other hand, water scarcity in the arid regions increases the susceptibility of kidneys to relatively minor insults. The tropics are home to a number of poisonous snakes and arthropods. Flooding of burrows in the rainy season forces snakes to come to the surface at a time when large numbers of workers are in the fields for planting or harvesting crops, leading to a spike in the incidence of bite victims. Seasonal variation in the incidence of AKI due to tropical infections and snake envenomation is a common feature throughout the tropics.",

Some recent studies, however, have shown that the outcomes are similar even with the use of a fixed lower dose of antivenom. Supportive measures include judicious volume replacement, inoculation with antitetanus immunoglobulin, and appropriate management of bleeding risk by the use of fresh frozen plasma as needed. Patients bitten by myotoxic snakes need aggressive fluid therapy and urinary alkalinization to prevent intratubular precipitation of myoglobin. Mortality from snakebite envenomation is estimated to be up to 35%.

Kidney injury is usually secondary to hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis, though direct toxicity has also been proposed. Less commonly, AKI has been described following isolated stings secondary to anaphylactic reactions or thrombotic microangiopathy [12]. Apart from AKI, proteinuria and nephritic and nephrotic syndromes have also been reported after insect stings [13\u201315]. The diagnosis is usually obvious.

There is a significant variation, however, in the frequency and outcome of obstetric AKI in different parts of tropics. In India, the contribution of obstetric AKI declined from 22% of all cases of AKI in the 1970s to approximately 8% in the 1990s. This decline was attributed to legalization of abortion and improvements in antenatal care [16]. In other parts of the tropics, however, obstetric AKI continues to be prevalent and has a poor prognosis even today. Septic abortion is the cause of AKI in 52% of patients in Ethiopia [17], and in Argentina and Nigeria, gynecological and obstetric complications still account for about one third of patients with AKI [18\u201320]. In one hospital in Pakistan, of 100 patients with obstetric AKI seen over a 3year period, over 90% needed dialysis, 7% died in hospital, and only 44% were off dialysis at discharge [21]. About 20% of all patients develop acute cortical necrosis, the most catastrophic variety of AKI. In recent years, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, secondary to genetic abnormalities in complement regulatory proteins, has been recognized in several cases of third trimester and postpartum AKI (Ramachandran R, unpublished).

Even some of the commonly ingested tropical plant foods can have toxic effects if consumed without proper preparation (Fig. 14.2). An example is the consumption of beans from the djenkol plant, a delicacy in several Southeast Asian countries [23]. Ingestion of a large amount of uncooked beans, especially in individuals with a low fluid intake, can cause oliguric AKI secondary to the intratubular precipitation of djenkolic acid crystals. The breath and urine of these patients have a characteristic, sulfurous odor, and the needlelike crystals can be seen in urine under light microscopy. Increased fluid intake and urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate help to dissolve the crystals.\n",

            "text": "In addition to the severity of the disease, poor healthcare systems and the lack of infrastructure are believed to contribute to mortality and morbidity from AKI in the tropics. Even though HD is available in most tropical countries (with the possible exception of a few sub-Saharan African nations), facilities are concentrated in large cities that are often unable to cope with the huge demand for their services. Peritoneal dialysis is often resorted to, especially in remote areas [51] and for small children [52]. In view of the simplicity of technique and minimal technical requirements, the ISN, in association with the International Pediatric Nephrology Association, International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, and the Sustainable Kidney Care Foundation, is implementing the Saving Young Lives project in tropical countries of Africa and Southeast Asia. Under this project, children with AKI are treated with PD [53].",
