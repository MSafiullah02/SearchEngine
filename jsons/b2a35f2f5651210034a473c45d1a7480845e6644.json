During the acute phase of the disease MHV infection causes acute encephalitis, and some strains of virus cause also hepatitis. Infection with the JHM strain of MHV causes severe panencephalitis, whereas MHV-A59 causes mild to moderate encephalitis involving specific limbic and limbic related areas of the brain and brain stem. The target cells are neurons and glia including oligodendrocytes. Demyelination during the acute stage is due to cytolytic infection of oligodendrocytes. After two weeks, the disease process enters a chronic stage of immune-mediated demyelination, in the presence of high levels of anti-viral antibodies and persistent low levels viral RNA in glial cells, without detectable levels of infectious virus or viral antigens.",

            "text": "The mechanism of demyelination in the model system of MHV-induced demyelination has been the subject of intense controversy. In the early years following its original description, the MHV model has been considered a perfect example of virus-induced demyelination due to direct cytolytic effect on oligodendrocytes, as opposed to EAE and the Theiler's virus induced encephalomyelitis model, which were considered the prototypes of autoimmune demyelination. In recent years, evidence was presented in favor of an immune-mediated mechanism in MHV-induced demyelination. However, examining the strong evidence that supports each mechanism it appears that the only explanation for to this discrepancy is that the two mechanisms co-exist in the same model. While the early descriptions referred to the cytolytic mechanism of acute infection, the later evidence described the mechanism that dominates the chronic disease. In the following chapter the histopathological features of MHV disease of the brain will be described for the two stages of the disease.",

MHV infection has been extensively used as a model system for viral persistence and for acute and chronic neurologic diseases (Weiner 1973; Knobler et al. 1981; Stohlman and Weiner 1981; Sorensen et al. 1982; Wege et al. 1982 ; Barthold and Smith 1983; Buchmeier et al. 1984; Perlman et al. 1990 ). The experimental models of neurotropic MHVs exhibit a bi-phasic disease. Acute meningoencephalitis (with or without hepatitis) is the major pathologic process in the first two weeks following inoculation. Subsequently, subacute and chronic diseases develop, which can be either an inflammatory demyelinating disease (in JHM and A59) or vasculitis (in MHV-3).",

Cheever and co-workers isolated JHM, a strain of MHV, from the brains of mice with hind leg paralysis (Cheever et al. 1949) . A detailed histological analysis by Bailey et al revealed disseminated encephalomyelitis and areas of demyelination with sparing of axons in the brain and spinal cord (Bailey et al. 1949 ). Twenty-four years later, Leslie Weiner studied in more details the pathogenesis of demyelination induced by JHM (Weiner 1973) . He found that the development of demyelination was a function of the age of mice, the dose of virus and the route of inoculation. The study was focused on demyelination during the 7-15 days post infection. There was evidence of viral antigen but no evidence of immunopathology. Immunosuppressive treatment did not abolish demyelination and taking all this information together the study concluded that JHM-induced demyelination was due to a cytopathic effect of the virus on oligodendrocytes. In the same year Lampert and co-workers came to the same conclusion.",

            "text": "Several laboratories including our own showed evidence of persistent coronavirus infection in both glial cell cultures and in animals. Persistent virions were demonstrated in chronic infection with ts mutant of JHM (Knobler et al. 1982) , and persistence of viral genome was found following infection with MHV-A59 . Persistent infection of glial cultures with MHV-A59 was used to demonstrate induction of MHC class I expression on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, mediated by a soluble factor (Suzumura et al. 1986; Suzumura et al. 1988; Lavi et al. 1989) . MHC class II induction mediated by viral particles has been demonstrated in glial cell infection with JHM (Massa et al. 1986 ). In the last decade the role of an immune mediated pathogenesis as the major mechanism of chronic MHVinduced demyelinating disease has been suggested based on indirect evidence. Adoptive transfer of demyelination with T cells from JHMinfected rats and in-vitro sensitivity to myelin basic protein suggested the possibility that MHV induced demyelination can be at least in part an immune-mediated, EAE-like disease (Watanabe et al. 1984 ). Immunosuppression of mice infected with JHM decreased the incidence of demyelination suggesting that the chronic demyelinating disease is immunemediated (Wang et al. 1990 ).",
