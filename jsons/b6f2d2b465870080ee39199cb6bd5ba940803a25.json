The present study studied the longitudinal profile of antibodies against SARScoronavirus (SARS-CoV) in SARS patients and evaluated the clinical significance of these antibodies. Methods: Two methods, ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent assay, were used for the detection of the anti-SARS-CoV IgG and IgM in 335 serial sera from 98 SARS patients. In 18 patients, serum antibody profiles were investigated and antibody neutralization tests were performed from 7 to 720 days after the onset of symptoms. Results: The ratios of positive IgG/IgM by ELISA were 0/0, 45.4/39.4, 88.6/71.4, 96/88, 100/48.6, 100/30.9, 100/17.1, 100/0 per cent, respectively, on 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, 29-60, 61-90, 91-180 and 181-720 days after the onset of symptoms. Antibodies were not detected within the first 7 days of illness, but IgG titre increased dramatically on day 15, reaching a peak on day 60, and remained high until day 180 from when it declined gradually until day 720. IgM was detected on day 15 and rapidly reached a peak, then declined gradually until it was undetectable on day 180. Neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the convalescence sera from SARS patients. Conclusion: The persistence of detectable IgG antibodies and neutralizing viral antibodies for up to 720 days suggest that SARS patients may be protected from recurrent SARS-CoV infection for up to 2 years.",

It was a life-threatening pandemic, affecting more than 8000 people worldwide with a case-fatality rate as high as 9.6%. [1] [2] [3] Studies showed that SARS was a rapidly progressive, atypical pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus. [4] [5] [6] [7] Since the discovery of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), laboratory diagnosis of the infection has become an important part of patient management, contact tracing and epidemiological studies. Recent studies have demonstrated that > 95% of patients with SARS mount an antibody response during convalescence. [8] [9] [10] [11] The most widely used current methods for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV in acute and convalescent phase sera are ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). 4, 12 The aim of this study was to investigate the longitudinal profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV in SARS patients during the course of illness using ELISA and IFA and to assess the effect of convalescent serum from SARS patients on SARS-CoV using the virus neutralization test. The intention was to gain a greater understanding of the immune response in humans following SARS infection. ",

All patients in the study demonstrated seroconversion to SARS-CoV, thereby confirming the diagnosis. IgG and IgM could not be detected within the first 7 days of illness. The earliest seroconversion occurred on day 10 after the onset of the disease. IgM antibodies were detected later than IgG antibodies, which may be because of the earlier development of IgG antibodies or the differential sensitivities of the class-specific ELISAs. IgG antibodies were significantly elevated on day 15, peaked on day 60, and remained high beyond day 180. IgM antibodies were detected and peaked on day 15 and disappeared by day 90. Almost all patients with serological evidence of SARS coronavirus infection developed pneumonic change on CXR. Most patients improved clinically and CXRs had resolved to a large extent by day 15 when serum antibodies began to rise or peaked, suggesting that these antibodies may be important in eliminating or neutralizing the CPEs of the SARS-CoV.",

The prolonged production of IgG suggests that, not only does it play a principal role in the humoral immune response against acute SARS-CoV infection, but also plays a crucial part in cleaning up residual virus during the recovery phase. Shi et al . have similarly shown that the activity of anti-SARS-CoV IgG remains active on day 210 after onset. 11 Recently, Woo et al . reported on the use of recombinant SARS-CoV, nucleocapsid protein, ELISA-based antibody tests for the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV pneumonia. 16 They showed that all convalescent patients (from whom serum samples were available) were still positive for anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG antibody on day 240 following the onset of illness. This study is the first to describe the longitudinal profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV in SARS patients up to 720 days after the onset of illness. The patients' IgG titres still remained positive on day 720 following the onset of symptoms, although their average titre was close to the cut-off value for positivity (1:10).",

All patients but one showed positive neutralization effects on day 540 and 720 after the onset of illness. This is an important observation as the presence of these antibodies may be necessary for the recovery of the patients as well as for the prevention of reinfection by SARS-CoV. However, this protective effect may not be permanent and may decline or even disappear over a period of 2 years, suggesting an appropriate vaccine may be necessary at that time.",
