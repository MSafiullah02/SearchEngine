The pandemic had a reproduction value of approximately 1.5 and appeared to exhibit a community transmissibility similar to the respiratory pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4] [5] [6] . Even though the most commonly affected age group was 5-45 years old, the influenza also affected other age groups, such as older adults, pregnant women, and children. By the end of the pandemic in 2010, it was registered that the virus caused the death of around 20 000 people all over the world, and it was fueled by the mobility between regions and different countries. In Ref. [7] the authors studied the role of travel restrictions in halting pandemics by using short-range mobility data and explored * lgalvere@mdp.edu.ar alternative scenarios by assessing the potential impact of mobility restrictions. However, although this strategy could be very effective, it was found only useful to slow down the spread of diseases, which might give time to the health authorities to develop a better strategy to stop the epidemic, for example, the development of a new vaccine. Fortunately, in the case of the H1N1 pandemic, it was possible to develop and deploy a vaccination campaign just in time to prevent further spread of disease.",

            "text": "It is well known that infectious diseases usually spread by physical contact between individuals in a society [8, 9] . Over the years, researchers have found that the best way to model these types of contact patterns [10] [11] [12] is by using the topology of complex networks [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , where people are represented by nodes and their interactions as links. A commonly used model for reproducing the dynamics of the spreading of endemic diseases, such as seasonal influenza or SARS [6] , is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [18] [19] [20] . This model groups individuals of a population into three compartments according to their state: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). When a susceptible individual is in contact with an infected one, it becomes infected with probability \u03b2, which is the same for everyone. Infected individuals recover after a period of time t r , i.e., they become immunized and cannot be infected again or infect others. When the parameters \u03b2 and t r are constant, the effective probability of infection is given by the transmissibility T = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) t r [21, 22] . The SIR model has a treelike structure with branches of infection that develop and expand, and this is because infected individuals cannot be reinfected, so the infection can only move forwards. It has been proven that this process can be mapped into link percolation [23, 24] , and thus the dynamic can be described using the generating function framework. The most important property in this framework is the probability f that a branch of infection will expand throughout the network [24] . When a branch of infection reaches a node with k connections across one of its links, it can only expand through its k \u2212 1 remaining connections. It can be shown that f satisfies the transcendental equation 1] , is the generating function of the underlying branching process [23] . Note that G 1 (1 \u2212 Tf ) represents the probability that the branches of infection do not expand throughout the network. In the steady state of this process, there is a critical threshold T c that separates an epidemic phase from a nonepidemic phase. When T T c there is an epidemicfree phase with only small outbreaks, which corresponds to finite clusters in link percolation theory. But, when T > T c an epidemic phase develops, the branches of infection contribute to a spanning cluster of recovered individuals. Thus, the probability of selecting a random node that belongs to the spanning cluster is given by",

            "text": "The spread of epidemics in networks [25] [26] [27] [28] have been the focus of motivation of several investigations that seek to develop and study different strategies of mitigation for decreasing the impact of diseases on healthy populations [18, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . On one hand, referring to nonpharmaceutical strategies, one of the most common and studied is \"quarantine,\" in which all individuals of the affected population must remain in isolation for a period of time. This scenario is difficult to perform, besides it involves a great economic loss. On the other hand, a more moderate strategy proposed is \"social distancing\" [34] [35] [36] . In this strategy, susceptible individuals distance themselves from infected or from those having the symptoms of the disease by removing links to them. Although all these strategies are beneficial, without any doubt, the most effective one is \"vaccination\" [37] (and references therein). In the early times random vaccination has been studied [38] . In this protocol susceptible individuals are vaccinated regardless of whether they are in contact with an infected individual, which requires a huge amount of vaccines and resources that may not be available. One way to improve this strategy is targeted vaccination [39] , that is, to vaccinate those people who have many connections and therefore higher probability of getting the disease and transmitting it. However, this strategy is difficult to implement, since the degrees of nodes in the network must be known in detail. In Ref. [40] , the authors proposed the acquaintance immunization strategy which does not require knowledge of degrees. In the model, a fraction of nodes is chosen at random, then some of their closest contacts get immunized. So, given that in scale-free networks a randomly chosen link points with high probability to a high degree node, this strategy is actually a preferential immunization of the hubs, which reduces dramatically the amount of vaccines needed to control the epidemic.",

With this new insight, the spread of epidemics was once again an important subject to investigate [32, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . On top of that, the cases of the H1N1 pandemic (2009) and the Ebola outbreak in Africa (2014), and their catastrophic consequences worldwide, have prompted the research of new mitigation strategies to avoid similar future epidemic outbreaks [36, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . With this motivation in mind, we develop a vaccination strategy which we called \"dynamic vaccination\" on the topology of a multiplex network. We are interested in studying how epidemic spreads in the presence of this vaccination protocol. In our model, the group of susceptible people that have a relation with infected individuals is the target of the immunization strategy. The contacts or neighbors of an infected person receives a vaccine with a probability \u03c9. If the susceptible individuals are vaccinated, then they acquire immunization and cannot be infected or infect others anymore.",

Those pairs of nodes in network A and B represent the same individual acting in different networks. For example, one network could represent the personal contacts of the individuals at their workplace and the other network their family or friends. Here q = 0.7. The colors of the nodes represent the following states: green ( ) for susceptible (S), red ( ) for infected (I), blue ( ) for recovered (R), and black ( ) for vaccinated individuals. In this case, we assume t r = 1. At t = 1, the patient zero infects one of its neighbors in network A and the other becomes vaccinated. Since this infected patient is present in both networks, it can also spread the disease in network B. The red lines indicate the direction of the branches of infection. In the next time step, t = 2, this patient zero recover in both networks and the newly infected individuals continue to spread the disease.

We randomly infect an individual in network A, which we call patient zero, and also its counterpart in network B, in case it belongs to both networks. Then, all the neighbors of this patient zero (in both networks, A and B) will be vaccinated and hence immunized with probability \u03c9. For the sake of simplicity, we consider that this probability is the same for all individuals. On the other hand, those neighbors who did not get vaccinated will be infected with probability (1 \u2212 \u03c9)\u03b2. Once an individual receive a vaccine, it can no longer acquire the disease and becomes immunized. Infected individuals will recover after t r time steps and cannot be affected by the disease anymore. In Fig. 1 we illustrate the dynamic of our model for t r = 1 and q = 0.7. We illustrate the model in Fig. 1 . At the beginning of the dynamic, at t = 1, there is only one infected node (patient zero in red). In network A, this individual has two neighbors: One of them gets vaccinated with probability \u03c9, and the other one becomes infected with probability (1 \u2212 \u03c9)\u03b2. As both individuals are present in both networks, their counterparts in network B are also vaccinated and infected, respectively. At t = 2, patient zero recovers in both networks and the newly infected individuals will try to infect their susceptible neighbors. In network A, one of the newly infected individuals has only one vaccinated neighbor and thus cannot spread the disease, and the other has three susceptible neighbors: One gets vaccinated, the other becomes infected, as well as the counterpart in network B, while the last remains susceptible. In network B there are two infected individuals, of which only one manages to infect one of its neighbors. At the next time step, this infected individual recovers and the newly infected individuals continue to spread the disease. The dynamic continues until the system reaches a steady state in which there are no more infected nodes (t = 4) and the epidemic process ends.",

Hence, for less interconnected networks a more virulent disease is needed in order to become an epidemic.

For high values of \u03b2, such as \u03b2 = 1, when \u03c9 = 0.1 the disease reaches 90% of the population, regardless of the overlap. But as \u03c9 increases, the immunized individuals block many of the paths that would be used by the disease to spread through the population. This causes a decrease in the probability that the disease might spread or \"percolate\" through an edge. Thus, as the probability of vaccination gets higher, the disease has to be more virulent to reach the entire system, which translates into an increase in the critical infection threshold \u03b2 c . Notice that for \u03c9 0.8, the disease never originates an epidemic despite its virulence. In contrast, in Figs. 2(b) and 2(d), we can see that the total fraction of vaccinated nodes does not behave monotonically with \u03b2. For small \u03b2, V increases until it reaches a maximum value and then starts to decrease. This maximum value varies with \u03c9, is more pronounced for low values of \u03c9, and vanishes as \u03c9 becomes larger. The inset in each plot shows this peak as a function of \u03c9. When the probability of vaccination is equal to zero, there is no vaccinated nodes. However, slightly above \u03c9 = 0 a peak exhibits. Then, as \u03c9 increases the fraction of vaccinated individuals in the peak also increases, reaching a certain value of \u03c9 above which the peak vanishes.

For instance, let us consider the case of low values of \u03c9, such as \u03c9 = 0.1. Slightly above \u03b2 c , the disease is not virulent enough so increasing \u03b2 the number of infected and vaccinated nodes increases. This is true until a certain value of \u03b2 that corresponds to the peak in V , above which individuals are more likely to become infected rather than vaccinated. On the contrary, in the case of high \u03c9 values, the peak is not exhibited. This is due to the fact that the virulence of the disease is not strong enough to overcome the vaccination. Furthermore, as \u03c9 increases and for high values of overlap, the fraction of vaccinated individuals is much higher than for low values of q. Now, in order to study the interplay between the layers, we vary the overlap in the system and consider a scenario of low and high probability of vaccination, \u03c9 = 0.1 (left) and \u03c9 = 0.7 (right). We show in Fig. 3 the difference between the total number of recovered individuals (R A -R B ) of each layer as a function of \u03b2. Each curve corresponds to different values of q, with q \u2208 [0, 1], and q = 0.1. In Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) we consider in layer A an ER network with average degree k A = 4, k min = 0 and k max = 40, and in layer B a SF network with \u03bb A = \u03bb B = 2.5, k min = 2 and k max = \u221a 10 5 , and an exponential cutoff c = 135, thus k B 4 [23] . Note that this type of SF network is appropriate to describe scenarios and structures of real-word systems [60] . For the case of isolated networks, q = 0, we can observe that there is a notable difference between the fraction of recovered individuals in each layer. For low values of \u03b2 it is well known that the level of the epidemic is higher in layer B due to the ultrasmall-world property [61] . In Fig. 3(a) , when the probability of vaccination is low, there are two regimes: for low values of \u03b2, the disease spreads more in the SF network, but above a certain \u03b2 value the ER network topology is more efficient to propagate the infection. In Fig. 3(c) , the networks have the same topology, and thus, it is expected that there will be more recovered individuals in the network (layer B) with larger average degree.",

We can see that there are two well marked regions: an epidemic and a nonepidemic phase, separated by a critical value of \u03b2. Increasing the overlapping q facilitates the spread of the epidemic, thus, \u03b2 c decreases and the epidemic phase regime is smaller. In all figures there is a critical value of \u03c9 above which, regardless of the virulence of the disease, there is no epidemic. In the case of no vaccination, \u03c9 = 0, we recover the regular SIR in multiplex networks and as \u03c9 increases, there will be more vaccinated individuals so \u03b2 c increases.",

Furthermore, as we increase \u03c9, for all values of q, we can see the existence of a threshold above which, even for very virulent diseases, the outbreak will never become an epidemic. The behavior of the plots in Fig. 4 is similar. From the figures above, we can see that by decreasing \u03bb B , we increase the heterogeneity of the network, and this facilitates the spread of the disease, since once the infection reaches a hub, a high degree node, it spreads rapidly across the network. The same applies for figures on the bottom: By connecting two networks with low average degree, the infection does not propagate so easily.",

In Fig. 5(a) , when the total fraction of vaccinated individuals is, for instance, V = 0.2, for the case of random vaccination R 0.55, while targeted immunization performs much better, R 0.15. On the other hand, note that for dynamic vaccination there are two possible outcomes of R depending on \u03c9. Using the same amount of vaccines (V = 0.2), if \u03c9 0.3, then R 0.4, but for \u03c9 0.6, we have a much more interesting scenario where the final fraction of recovered individuals is close R 0.1. In this last case, there is almost no difference between targeted and dynamic vaccination. In some cases, there is a threshold value V * , above which there is no epidemic. For instance, in Fig. 5(b) , V * = 0.45 (targeted) and V * = 0.65 (random). However, in the case of dynamic vaccination V * \u2192 0 when \u03c9 \u2192 1, i.e., a very small amount of vaccines is needed to prevent the epidemic. In short, from Fig. 5 we can see that, for the same amount of vaccinated individuals, the number of recovered individuals is significantly lower for dynamic vaccination compared to random vaccination. This is observed in all plots, which indicates that our strategy is significantly more effective than random vaccination. Especially, in more heterogeneous networks, such as SF networks, we can see that this strategy is even more efficient.",

In our model, susceptible individuals in contact with infected patients have the opportunity to be vaccinated before the their neighbors attempt to infect them. That is, each time an infected person comes into contact with a susceptible individual, this one will try to get vaccinated with probability \u03c9 and if he does not succeed he will be infected with probability \u03b2. Each infected node is assumed to recover after t r time steps and will become immunized. Besides, vaccinated nodes are also immunized and cannot be infected or infect others. By mapping this process into bond percolation and using the framework of generating functions, we analyzed analytically the total fraction of recovered and vaccinated nodes in the steady state as a function of the virulence of the disease \u03b2 for different values of \u03c9 and q, and we found a perfect agreement between the theoretical and the simulation results. As expected we find that as \u03c9 increases, the epidemic threshold \u03b2 c becomes larger and disappears for very large values of \u03c9. We also find a peak, for certain values of the parameters, in the fraction of vaccinated nodes as a function of \u03c9, which is determined by the competition between the vaccination strategy and the spread of disease. We find an interesting phase diagram in the plane \u03b2-\u03c9, where we can see an epidemic phase, which diminishes as q and \u03c9 increase, and a nonepidemic phase, where the diseases cannot spread. A remarkable result of the phase diagram is that for certain values of q and \u03c9, regardless of the virulence of the disease, it will never become an epidemic. Finally, we demonstrate that our strategy is always more efficient than random immunization and, depending on \u03c9, performs better or worse than targeted vaccination. For high vaccination probabilities, i.e., when the population is more receptive to be vaccinated, dynamic immunization is the most effective strategy to avoid or mitigate an epidemic. This goal can be achieved using efficiently the available vaccines, immunizing a small fraction of the population and creating a barrier of vaccinated individuals that the infection cannot pass through.
