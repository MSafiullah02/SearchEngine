The superior diagnostic yield of multiplex PCR means that a pathogen is detected rapidly in a much greater proportion of patients, so therapy can be quickly tailored to the responsible organism. In some situations, this will allow narrowing of antimicrobial therapy: for example, identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae facilitating a change of antibiotics to penicillin, in geographical areas with a low prevalence of penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae. In other cases, it may facilitate a change or escalation of antimicrobial therapy: for example, the identification of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which would not be covered by empirical regimens in many areas. The absence of detection is also helpful: the sensitivity when compared to culture of molecular assays is very high so can reassure clinicians that organisms are not present and so support decisions to stop unnecessary antibiotics or to deescalate antibiotics that were used empirically to cover organisms subsequently not detected.",

Gadsby et al. developed and internally validated their own syndromic molecular assay for pneumonia. They used this to test sputum samples of 323 adults admitted to hospital with CAP16. Their assay detected a pathogen in 87% of patients (as opposed to 39% of patients using only routine culture). As a result, they proposed that 77% of antibiotic prescriptions in CAP could have been de-escalated based on results from multiplex PCR testing.

It found that patients who were tested with the FilmArray were significantly more likely to receive a single dose or shorter course of antibiotics24 than those who were not.

A post hoc analysis56 of patients who tested positive for respiratory viruses in the trial highlighted an association between rapid turn-around time (defined as <1.6 h), shorter hospital admission and shorter durations of antibiotic therapy. It is our belief that point-of-care testing represents the ideal strategy for new, rapid diagnostic test platforms allowing clinicians to maximise the benefit from such accurate tests early in the decision-making process. Clearly, rigorous quality assurance is essential for any diagnostic test irrespective of the site of testing. It should also be noted that the tests described in this article are not currently CLIA waivered - a requirement for use at the point-of-care in the US.",
