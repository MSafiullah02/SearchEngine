Family history was unremarkable with no effected family members. Mother was 22 years old and had an uncomplicated pregnancy; however, hypoplastic nasal bone and microcephaly of the baby had been detected on antenatal ultrasonography (USG). Neither amniocentesis nor further investigation for the dysmorphic findings were performed prenatally. The proband was born at term by normal vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 3.800 g (+ 1.5 SDS). Microcephaly, proptosis, and hypoplastic nasal bone with midface hypoplasia were noticed on examination. Intubation and transfer to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were required due to respiratory distress. He received mechanical ventilation and intensive medical support. Clavicular fractures including one healed fracture had been detected on X-ray taken at the first day of life. Hypocalcemia (5.4 mg/dl; N: 9\u201311) with elevated PTH (430 pg/m; N: 15\u201365) and low 25-OH Vit D (10.9 ug/L; N: 30\u2013100) levels had been detected on 2nd day of life during routine screening for the fractures and treated with intravenous Ca and vitamin D supplementation. No other hypocalcemic event had been detected during the follow-up. Tracheostomy operation and gastrostomy tube insertion were performed at the postnatal 48th day and at 5.5 months of age, respectively. Echocardiography revealed mild insufficiency of mitral and tricuspid valves and pulmonary hypertension. Patient could be discharged to home with home ventilation at the age of 8 months. Although his cranial MRI was normal at birth, hydrocephaly was detected at 5 months of age (Suppl. Fig.). Ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation was performed at 9 months of age.",

PCR conditions and primers will be provided upon request. Data were analyzed with Sophia-DDM-v4 software. Heterozygous c.1645C > T (p.Arg549Trp) missense mutation and novel heterozygous c.863 + 5G > C intronic variation were detected (Fig. 4). First mutation is a known to be pathogenic according to ClinVar and Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD). Second mutation is not present at these databases and GnomAD, 1000 Genome, and ESP5400 databases. According to in silico analysis with Mutation Taster and Human Splicing Finder; c.863 + 5G > C variation is predicted to affect splicing. Since there were no patient derived cells or total RNA material, we could not further evaluate the effect of this novel mutation on expression of FAM20C. After considering of all this bioinformatic processes and our patient\u2019s phenotype, this variation accepted as a pathogenic mutation. Segregation analysis revealed that his father had heterozygous c.1645C > T (p.Arg549Trp) and his mother had heterozygous c.863 + 5G > C mutation and the patient was only child of the family.",

            "text": "Genotype phenotype correlation had been suggested for lethality in RS, since, mutations in lethal and non-lethal phenotypes affect different domains of the protein. FAM20C mutations located in the signal sequence (SS) domain can affect the secretion of protein because of improper protein stabilization/folding, while the mutations effecting C-terminal domain (CCD) may cause loss of function of the kinase activity [3, 4, 14, 16]. The majority of the lethal mutations are located in the conserved CCD [2, 3]. The c.1645C > T (p.Arg549Trp) mutation detected in our patients was localized in the CCD of the protein and reported in a lethal RS case in homozygous state [2, 29]. The maternally inherited novel c.863 + 5G > C variant is located in the intronic region of the gene, which might have a deleterious effect on splicing for the proper formation of FAM20C protein as analyzed with in silico tools. Our patient had severe/lethal genotype; however, he had survived up to the 17 months of age due to prenatal detection of hypoplastic nasal bone and early intervention with intensive care settings, which enabled him to survive through most critical neonatal period. However, he had severe neurological delay and never gained any developmental milestones and stayed in a vegetative state. Genotypes and clinical features of previous cases with RS have been summarized including the present case in Fig. 4 and supplementary Table 2.",

Midface cranial deformities lead to major dysmorphic features of the disease and tightening supraorbital rim decreases the orbital volume causing exophthalmos, as in our case. Furthermore, our patient had optic atrophy with hypoplastic optic nerve, periventricular calcifications, corpus callosum hypoplasia, and hydrocephalus requiring shunt operation at nine months of age. Intracranial calcifications are commonly reported in RS [3]; however, hydrocephalus [27, 28, 33], optic atrophy [19], and corpus callosum dysgenesis [37] are reported rarely. Here we showed that hydrocephalus was not congenital and triventricular, suggesting that underdeveloped posterior fossa led to obstruction of CSF circulation with age. Similar to our patient, previously reported cases with hydrocephalus required shunt operation at 6 to 8 months of age [27, 28, 33]. These cases were also most severely affected non-lethal RS cases with severe mental and motor delay [27, 28] or lethal cases live long enough to develop hydrocephalus [33]. Thus, it must be kept in mind that patients with RS can develop hydrocephalus with time and cranial imaging is required in case of neurological deterioration.",

            "text": "Generalized osteosclerosis is the most common radiological finding of RS. In our case, serial skeletal X-rays revealed diffuse osteosclerosis at birth, which was gradually reduced by the age of 5 months. Medullary space of long bones became distinguishable with \u201cbone-within-a bone\u201d appearance (Figs. 2, 3). This type of bone changes has not been reported previously in RS. Although we did not have any histopathological tissue analysis, we hypothesize that this appearance might develop as a result of hypomineralized periosteal bone formation on a sclerotic background bone during the course of the disease. Reducing osteosclerosis and visible medullary space occurred at the same period. We think that undermineralized periosteal bone formation or decreasing osteosclerosis could be related to the hypophosphatemia and related osteomalacia. In case of inherited hypophosphatemia, hypophosphatemia and rickets develop after birth following cessation of transplacental phosphate transport, which is also evident in a few RS cases studied shortly after birth [31]. In line with that, undermineralization, but not osteosclerosis, had been detected in conditional Fam20c knockout mice in older ages [10, 41]. However, all reported cases with generalized osteosclerosis in RS were detected at birth or shortly after birth. Only a few cases could be studied for long-term radiological features in milder form (non-lethal) of the disease. Fradin et al. [20] reported generalized osteosclerosis at birth which decreased with age, and the patient had normal appearing bones with distinct corticomedullary differentiation and normal cortical thickness at 3 years of age. Additionally, RS cases presenting in older ages had preserved corticomedullary junction or only focal sclerosis and mildly increased bone mineral density [5, 20, 24, 28, 37, 39]. Therefore, it seems that osteosclerosis and especially periosteal bone formation is related to the severity of the RS. Most severe form with early postnatal lethality showed extensive sclerotic periosteal bone formation which could be detected prenatally [2, 29, 31]. However, cases with non-lethal RS have osteosclerosis at birth which decreased with age and remained as focal sclerosis or mildly elevated bone mineral density. No case similar to that presented here had been reported with evolution of radiological findings with severe form of the disease in the literature.",

Overexpression of DMP1 fails to rescue bone phenotype and hypophosphatemia in Fam20c knockout mice suggesting that DMP1 is not the major causative factor [18]. Although this mechanism is clearly known today, biochemical data of previous RS cases have not always been reported (Suppl. Table 2) [2, 30, 31, 36\u201338]. FGF23 levels could be studied in a few cases and shown to be elevated [4, 5, 28, 39], but elevated urinary phosphate excretion had been shown in almost all cases including the case herein [24, 27, 28, 34, 39]. However, serum phosphate levels were found to be normal in some of the patients [4, 20, 32\u201335]. Additionally, the development of hypophosphatemia in cases with normal phosphate levels is also detected in later ages, in puberty and in adulthood [34]. Therefore, in case of normal phosphate levels, follow-up for the development of hypophosphatemia is required. There are only a few data about the effect of treatment with alfacalcidol/calcitriol and oral phosphorus in RS. In this report, we could not normalize PTH and phosphate levels in our patient in spite of dose increments, but phosphate doses could not be increased further due to elevated PTH levels. However, some improvement was seen in ALP and rickets findings. Mild hyperparathyroidism can be seen at initial presentation due to inhibitory effect of FGF23 on 11,25(OH)2D, leading to poor calcium absorption from gastrointestinal tract in hypophosphatemic rickets. After the initiation of phosphorus, hyperparathyroidism is mostly due to higher phosphate doses relative to calcitriol doses. However, in our patient with RS we could not normalize PTH in spite of calcitriol dose increment. Poor treatment response similar to our case was also detected in two non-lethal but severe RS [27, 28]. These observations suggest that in severe RS cases, much higher than regular doses of calcitriol could be required. Alternatively, novel treatment options such as anti-FGF23 monoclonal antibody could be tried. However, in milder form of RS, spontaneous improvement of hypophosphatemia and/or no rachitic changes have been observed in older patients [4].",

Our patient had hypocalcemia at the second day of life with elevated PTH and low 25-OH Vit D levels. Similarly, hypocalcemia with elevated PTH and low 25-OH Vit D has been detected in one non-lethal but severe RS case at 2 months of age and treated with vitamin D and calcium, but continued to have hypophosphatemia and rickets [28]. Thus, it seems that patients with RS are prone to hypocalcemia in early neonatal period most probably related to the abrupt cessation of transplacental calcium transport, especially in vitamin D deficiency settings. On the other hand, either increasing Ca influx to the bone or decreased bone resorption might be operative in osteosclerotic conditions and contribute to the development of hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia should be checked at early postnatal hours in these cases even in the absence of symptoms as in our case.",

            "text": "Perivascular, white matter, and basal ganglia calcifications are common and reported in 95% of RS cases (Suppl. Table 2). Nephrocalcinosis is not examined in most of the cases; however, 6 cases with nephrocalcinosis including the case reported herein were identified. Ectopic soft tissue calcifications and calcification in different organ systems such as ovaries, liver, and spleen have been also reported in RS [20, 21, 25]. It seems that intracranial calcification is a consistent feature of the disease and independent from serum calcium and phosphate, as it has been described at birth and/or antenatal USG [2, 31, 38]. Furthermore, nephrocalcinosis also appears to develop independently from calcium and phosphate status since it was present at the first day of life in our case and has also been described in a case with normal serum calcium and phosphate levels [20]. Although mechanism of nephrocalcinosis, intracranial and soft tissue calcification in RS is not known, we hypothesize that FAM20C deficiency leading to impaired phosphorylation of OPN and BSP might have a role in calcifications (15), since OPN and BSP are localized to matrix vesicle and regulate extracellular matrix calcification. Additionally, it has been shown that SIBLING derived protease-resistant phosphorylated peptide (ASARM peptide) is also phosphorylated by FAM20C and non-phosphorylated ASARM peptides enhance mineralization while phosphorylated ones inhibit mineralization [42, 43]. Thus, phosphorylation defects related to the FAM20C deficiency of SIBLING or its degradation product (ASARM peptide) might cause dysregulated mineralization in bone and soft tissues in RS.",
