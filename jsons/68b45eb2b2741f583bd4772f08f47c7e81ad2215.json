A set of specialized proteins in this 46 semipermeable membrane, work like gatekeepers to the cell and regulate entry of these 47 biomolecules. One class of such surface proteins is termed as receptors. Viruses bind to 48 one or more of these receptors and manipulate gatekeepers for their own successful entry 49 into host--cells. A membrane protein that influenza A virus (Flu virus) uses for entry into 50 the cells was not discovered till date. This study reports for the first time, a receptor for 51 3 influenza A virus, that was sought after by researchers for decades. The viral receptor is a 52 promising target that can be used to inhibit virus entry into host cells. 53 54 Introduction 55 The outermost surface of mammalian cells typically bear a covering of branched sugar residues 56 (oligosaccharides) that allow a wide range of interactions with different biomolecules 57 (hormones, cytokines, growth factors etc.) of the matrix (1). These oligosaccharides are often 58 linked to membrane proteins (glycoproteins) or lipid (gangliosides) at the cell surface. The type 59 of sugar residues and their branching is responsible in deciding specificity of oligosaccharides 60 towards biomolecules coming in contact with the cell surface. This interactions between 61 oligosaccharides and biomolecules play a diverse physiological role and are important in 62 maintaining communication and transport of molecules, between the cell and its surroundings 63",

Information on a 71 host glycoprotein receptor that can pull virus into the cell is largely unknown. Most of the 72 published literature on influenza entry are centric to the early attachment factor viz. 73 oligosaccharides. The importance of the role of SIA in IAV entry has been documented as early 74 as 1959 (6) however, there are reports showing IAV entry into host cells even in the absence of 75 SIA (7, 8, 9).

Critically, we argued that CD66c 269 being a membrane glycoprotein might also be expected to serve as a low-specificity receptor 270 for viruses other than IAV. To this effect, we sought to establish the specificity of CD66c 271 towards influenza virus against an unrelated RNA virus -HCV. We conducted these 272 experiments in human hepatoma Huh cells that were siRNA-mediated-silenced for CD66c 273 expression. We monitored HCV entry into these Huh cells by checking the expression levels of 274 the HCV NS3 protein (Figure 9 ). This data clearly showed that the absence of CD66c in Huh 275 cells had not inhibited entry of HCV, thus proving that CD66c was not a low-specificity 276 general viral receptor. 277",

Thus, we incubated 1\u00b5g 282 of biologically active recombinant CD66c (rCD66c), that was produced in mouse myeloma cell 283 lines, with 7.4 X 10 7 PFU IAV before intranasal infection of BALB/c mice. After ten days of 284 infecting mice with virus through intranasal inoculation, we noticed a considerable reduction in 285 alveolitis in the mice that were infected with rCD66c bound IAV ( Figure In our search for a receptor for IAV, we chose to follow the experimental path followed by 297 many other research groups to identify new viral receptors (13-20). We conducted similar 298 experiments in detail, which could validate the interaction between viral NA and host CD66c at 299 the outer cell surface, during IAV attachment and entry. The results thus obtained from these 300 experiments provided sufficient evidence that suggested CD66c as the glycoprotein receptor for 301 influenza virus. The validation of a protein receptor for influenza virus from this study provides 302 valuable insights into some unresolved problems of influenza entry. For instance, it was cited in 303 the earlier studies on influenza entry that although sialic acid was required for virus binding, a 304 specific subset of glycoprotein receptors was necessary for effective viral entry (8, 9) , which is 305 yet unknown. Therefore, with the results presented here, we suggest that CD66c is at least one, 306 of the possibly many, glycoprotein receptors. Additionally, this study may further lead to the 307 discovery of other glycoprotein receptors or co-receptors playing a role in virus entry besides 308",

In addition to that, Sialyl-Lewis X is reported as the common 330 receptor determinant of a number of influenza viruses of the terrestrial poultry (30). Therefore 331 presence of Sialyl-Lewis X on the CD66c molecules makes the latter a strong glycoprotein 332 receptor candidate for the IAV.

It is important to mention here that, the receptor 352 and their modulated co-expression by type I and type II interferon was reported recently (33, 358 41).

In that context, here a decrease in viral 199 load in cells knocked down for CD66c (Figure 4a) may be implicated due to a corresponding 200 down modulation of cell survival pathway (PI3K-Akt). Therefore this result (Figure 4a) is not 201 sufficient to claim CD66c is a receptor. To validate CD66c is a receptor for viral entry, we need 202 evidence to demonstrate effect of direct interaction, between CD66c and NA at the host cell 203 surface, in virus entry. Therefore, we conducted the receptor-blockade experiment. An 204 experiment demonstrating that a disruption of physical interaction between host CD66c and 205 viral NA at the cell surface could affect viral entry. Initially, we performed antibody-mediated 206 receptor blockade experiments on CD66c overexpressing NIH3T3 (NIH3T3-CD66c) cells. For 207 experiment revealed significant decrease in virus infection in a dose dependent 210 manner. The virus entry levels in these cells were determined by the mRNA levels of viral NP 211 (Figure 5a). Likewise inhibition of virus entry was observed by determining expression levels 212 of viral NP protein in NIH3T3-CD66c cells, when treated with increasing concentrations of 213 anti-CD66c mAb prior to infection (Figure 5b). From these results, lower levels of NP (mRNA 214 and protein) in anti-CD66c mAb treated cells suggested that masking of CD66c on host cell 215 surface by mAb reduced its access to NA spike protein present on the envelope of the infecting 216 virus particles thus inhibiting virus binding and uptake.

For extracellular 429 staining was two-step process, wherein cells fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were incubated 430 with primary antibody (anti-CD66c or anti-NA) followed by respective fluorescent secondary 431 antibodies, bypassing the cell permeabilisation step. Primary antibody was used at a dilution of 432 1:100 and secondary antibodies were used at a dilution ratio of 1:1000 in antibody solution. 433 434 Flow cytometric analysis 435 For intracellular Influenza NP staining, viral infected cells were washed with PBS and 436 centrifuged to remove debris. Single cell suspension thus formed was fixed with 4% 437 paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Fixed cells were then washed twice with PBS containing 3% 438 FCS and resuspended in a permeabilisation buffer (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD) for 10 minutes. 439 The permeabilised cells were incubated for 45 minutes with Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 440 conjugated NP antibody (primary) in PBS (with 3% FCS). The stained cells were washed with 441 buffer (3% FCS in PBS) to remove unbound antibody and taken for cytometric readings. For 442 extracellular staining of CD66c or the viral NA attached to cells during virus binding 443 experiments, we performed standard extracellular staining protocol bypassing the cell 444 permeabilisation step. Cells with or without virus on their surface were fixed with 4% PFA in 445 PBS, followed by washing with PBS. Fixed cells or cell-virus complex were then incubated 446 with anti-CD66c primary monoclonal antibody or anti-NA primary antibody in 50 \u00b5L of PBS 447 with 3% FCS for 40 minutes at 4\u00b0C (antibodies to solution ratio was 1:200). After washing 448 unbound antibodies cells were incubated with secondary antibody against these primary 449 antibodies (anti-CD66c, anti-NA) in 50\u00b5L of PBS with 3% FCS for 40 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Ratio of 450 secondary antibodies to solution was 1:1000 (v/v). After washing unbound secondary 451 antibodies to cells in PBS with 3% FCS, stained cells were taken for cytometric analysis.452",

Scand J Immunol 58: 628. (a): Flow cytometry analysis of surface expression of CD66c in A549 cells. Cell 660 surface expression of untagged CD66c was determined using flow cytometer, where cells were 661 stained for CD66c (Alexa-594). Cell population transiently overexpressing CD66c shows 662 signal for higher expression of CD66c on the cell surface (black) as compared to A549 cells 663 (grey). The unstained control cells are shown in white. 664 (b): Flow cytometry analysis of virus binding on A549 cells and CD66c 666 overexpressing A549 cells. 5 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of PR8 virus binding to a 667 monolayer of A549 cells was measured by determining signals corresponding to stained NA 668 protein (Alexa-488) of the virus on host cell surface. In figure, black curve denotes signal of 669 unstained cells while grey curve depicts the signal for viral NA corresponding to the virus 670 binding on the cell surface. The left panel shows that virus is binding to ~ 18% of A549 cell 671 population. However, the right panel shows that PR8 virus binding is increased to more than 672 80% of CD66c overexpressing A549 cell population. 673 (c): Demonstration of virus binding to A549 cell surface, through 675 immunofluorescence assay and confocal microscope. To a monolayer of A549 cells, binding 676 of 5 multiplicity of infection (moi) of PR8 virus was observed under confocal microscope 677 (A1R; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 60X magnification, after extracellular immune-fluorescence-678 assay (IFA) staining of viral NA and host CD66c protein. Panels can be numbered 1 to 4 from 679 left to right. Panel 1 shows cell nuclei stained with DAPI in cells of the selected microscopic 680 field. Panel 2 shows that, CD66c (red) being a membrane protein is mainly at the periphery of 681 cells. Panel 3 shows that virus is present at the surface of A549 cells (green), as cells were fixed 682 just after their brief binding on cell. In Panel 4 we see the colocalisation (yellow) of NA protein 683 of PR8 virus (green) with host membrane protein CD66c (red) at the periphery of cells. (a): Real time quantification of NP and M1 mRNA in viral infected A549 cells. 686 The untagged CD66c expressing plasmids were transfected into A549 lung cell lines. 48 hour 687 post transfection, cells were infected with 1.0 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) A/PR8/34 688 influenza virus. 8 hours post infection (8 h.p.i) infected cells were harvested for mRNA 689 isolation and subsequent quantification. Levels of two viral mRNA NP and M1 were quantified 690 to compare the viral load in infected lung cells. Figure shows higher mRNA levels of NP (left 691 two bars) and M1 (right two bars) in cells overexpressing CD66c. Each bar represents mean of 692 five independent experimental readings. (b): Semi quantification of viral M1 by RT-PCR. 693 For the above mentioned reaction condition (8 h.p.i, and 1 m.o.i.) viral M1 mRNA was also 694 measured semi-quantitatively. A549 cells are denoted with 'C' before respective lanes and 695 likewise A549 cells having overexpressed CD66c with 'T'. Cycles are the number of PCR 696 cycles. (c): Flow cytometric analysis for virus load in A549 infected cell: Following similar 697 gene expression and viral infection conditions (8 h.p.i,), in another set of experiment, A549 698 cells were harvested to quantify protein level of viral NP through flow cytometry, in cells 699 infected with 0.5 m.o.i. of A/PR8/34 influenza virus. NP expression levels in cells were 700 measured through intracellular staining by NP-FITC conjugated antibody. The bar diagram 701 shows rise in viral NP in CD66c overexpressing A549 cells (right) than that in A549 cells (left). 702 Each bar represents mean of three independent experimental readings. Data represent mean 703 values of at least three independent experiments \u00b1 SD. Statistical significance was assessed by 704 student's t-test, (*) for p \u2264 0.05, (**) for p \u2264 0.01 and (***) for P \u2264 0.001. 705 (d): Representative FACS snapshot of unstained A549 cells showing no signal corresponding 706 to NP-FITC in lower-right quadrant. 707 (e): A549 cells show some signal corresponding to NP-FITC in lower-right quadrant. 708 (f): A549 cells overexpressing CD66c is shown to have increased NP-FITC signal in lower-709 right quadrant. Demonstration of rise in viral uptake in CD66c overexpressing NIH 3T3 and 712 Lec2-CHO cell lines. (a): The level of infection as probed by the NP mRNA fold-change is 713 shown as bars. The bar in the right end shows increased influenza infection in CD66c 714 transfected NIH3T3 cell lines. (b): Lec2 CHO-CD66c is CD66c overexpressing Lec2 CHO cell 715 lines. The right bar shows greater virus binding on the surface of cells overexpressing CD66c. 716 (c): The right bar in the figure shows increased level of viral NP mRNA Lec2 CHO-CD66c 717 cells (right bar) as compared to Lec2 CHO cells (left bar) suggesting increased virus entry. 718 (d): The left bar shows levels of mRNA corresponding to lower infection level in HEK cells 719 and the right bar shows an increase in infection in CD66c overexpressing HEK cells. 720 (a): Knockdown of CD66c shows inhibition of virus binding on cell surface 722 under fluorescent microscope. Here, UI denotes uninfected cells; 5', Cells after 5 minutes of 723 virus binding to them. Figure shows that A549 cells treated with siRNA control (negative) do 724 not inhibit expression level of CD66c (green) and therefore binding of 5 MOI of PR8 viruses 725 on cell surface can be seen. Figure shows colocalisation between NA (red) and CD66c (green) 726 in merged view (yellow) (second panel from top, pointed with white arrow). Amount of co-727 localization between NA and CD66c and absence of NA (red color) in control siRNA treated 728 cells signifies possible colocalisation between CD66c and NA at the host cell surface. The 729 lowest two panels show diminished green signals in cells treated with CD66c siRNA 730 suggesting a poor expression of CD66c protein (green). Consequently, virus binding on siRNA-731 CD66c treated cells is not seen, as evident by the absence of any green (CD66c) or red (NA) 732 signal (bottom panel). 733 (b): siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD66c shows inhibition of virus entry into 735 lung-cells infected with 1 m.o.i. of PR8 virus, through western blot analysis. Here, Si-CT 736 denotes control siRNA treated cells; Si-CD66c is cells treated with CD66c siRNA. 8h is cells 737 harvested after 8 hours of infection (one life cycle of IAV), UI, is uninfected cells. A549 cells 738 treated with siRNA shows complete knock down of the receptor molecule CD66c (third panel 739 from top) while control siRNA treated cells do not show any reduction in expression of CD66c 740 (left two wells of third panel). The fourth panel from top shows level of A/PR8/34 influenza 741 virus entry in cells determined by expression levels of viral NP protein. The second well from 742 left shows significant expression level of viral NP protein in cells treated with control siRNA, 743 eight hours after infection. In contrast, the right most well shows a marked reduction of IAV 744 entry in cells treated with CD66c siRNA, as determined by low expression level of viral protein 745 NP eight hours after infection. Conclusively, virus entry was inhibited in absence of CD66c 746 (CD66c siRNA treated cells). CD66c siRNA treated cells do not show any noticeable change 747 in expression levels of EGRF (top most panel) and DC-SIGN (second panel from top). For 748 loading control \u03b2-Actin was probed (the bottom panel). 749 Antibody mediated receptor blockade experiments in CD66c overexpressing 751 cells. (a): The figure shows level of A/PR8/34 influenza virus entry in a monolayer of NIH3T3-752 CD66c cells when treated with mAb anti-CD66c prior to infection. From left to right, the first 753 bar in the figure represents levels of viral NP mRNA (a measure of virus entry) in untreated 754 NIH3T3-CD66c. Bars second to fifth from left show levels of viral NP mRNA in virus-infected 755 cells treated with mAb anti-CD66c at the concentration of 1.0 \u00b5g/mL, 1.5 \u00b5g/mL, 2.0 \u00b5g/mL 756 and 8.0 \u00b5g/mL respectively. Conclusively, the data show decrease in virus entry in cells treated 757 with anti-CD66c in a dose dependent manner. Data represent mean values of at least three 758 independent experiments \u00b1 SD. Statistical significance was assessed by student's t-test 759 (GraphPad), (*) for p \u2264 0.05, (**) for p \u2264 0.01 and (***) for P \u2264 0.001. (b): A western blot 760 showing expression levels of viral NP protein in virus-infected NIH3T3-CD66c when treated 761 Antibody mediated receptor blockade experiments in A549 cells expressing 766 endogenous levels of CD66c. 767 Figure shows A/PR8/34 influenza virus infection levels in lung A549 cells (24 h.p.i.), when 768 incubated with increasing concentrations of anti-CD66c mAb prior to infection. (a): Semi 769 quantification of viral M1 mRNA shows significant difference in virus entry. Left well shows 770 M1 mRNA level in A549 cells, the middle well shows that in cells incubated with mAb anti-771 CD66c. And the right well shows M1 mRNA level in cells incubated with mock antibody (IgG 772 isotype antibody) prior to viral infection. (b): Densitometry analysis of image (a). The cells 773 treated with anti-CD66c showed reduced virus entry as against the untreated and IgG isotype 774 antibody treated cells. The expression level of housekeeping gene acidic ribosomal 775 phosphoprotein (ARPP) is not affected in any of these cells. (c): The black bar represents A549 776 cell populations expressing viral NP protein (a measure of virus entry) after infection without 777 any anti-CD66c treatment. Whereas grey bars (from left to right) represent the same in A549 778 cells treated with anti-CD66c mAb, prior to infection, at the concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5g/mL, 1.5 779 \u00b5g/mL, 2 \u00b5g/mL, 4 \u00b5g/mL and 8 \u00b5g/mL respectively. Here, the population of virus-infected 780 cells expressing viral NP protein determines extent of virus entry. Conclusively, the bar 781 diagram shows that cells treated with anti-CD66c mAb showed inhibited virus entry. The 782 inhibition of the virus entry varied in a dose (of anti-CD66c) dependent manner. Each bar 783 represents mean of three independent experimental readings. Data show the mean percent 784 infection (\u00b1 SD) from 4 independent experiments.
