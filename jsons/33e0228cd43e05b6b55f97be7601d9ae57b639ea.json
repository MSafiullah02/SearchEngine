Gu et al. indicated that a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) could detect lung nodules with a competition performance metric of 0.7967. They proposed a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to improve the detection sensitivity of the network [15] . Also, the CAD system based on a 3D skeletonization feature proposed by Zhang et al. can assist radiologists to differentiate lung nodules from interferential vessels [16] . Transforming an image to the time-frequency domain by the optimal fractional S-transform (OFrST) method can provide meaningful information and features, which can be used to diagnose diseases. This method was applied on lung CT images by Sun et al. to detect and differentiate nodules from the vessels. They employed the Teager-Kaiser energy (TKE) in the time-frequency domain to obtain the energy distribution and characterize lung nodules with 97.87% sensitivity [17] . Sun et al. concluded that the CNN represented higher performance than deep belief network (DBN) and stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) in diagnosing malignant lung nodules with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.899 [18] . Furthermore, CAD systems are a useful tool to monitor lung function after transplantation. In this regard, Barbosa et al. compared the quantitative CT (qCT), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and semi-quantitative image scores (SQS) metrics and found that pulmonary function testing and qCT metrics demonstrated the highest accuracy for monitoring bi-and unilateral lung transplantation with an AUC of 0.771 and 0.817, respectively [19] . The potential of CAD systems can go even further and help radiologists to detect lung abnormalities by computerized analysis of pulmonary sounds [20] and flow and gas concentration of breath [21] .",

The GoogleNet is a deep model, which is trained on either the ImageNet or Places365 datasets. In this study, we used the GoogleNet trained on the ImageNet dataset [25] . The network is 22-layers deep, starts with three convolution layers, followed by 9 inception blocks, and ends with a fully-connected layer. The inception block as a core part of the GoogleNet is shown in Fig. 3e . MobileNet-V2 is a light-weight CNN with 53 layers deep (52 convolution and one fully connected layers) [26] . The primary part architecture of the network is based on inverted residual and linear bottlenecks. The network starts with three convolution layers, followed by 16 inverted residual and linear bottleneck blocks and ends with one convolution layer and one fully-connected layer. The scheme of the inverted residual block, which is the main part of the network and is illustrated in Fig 3f. ResNet is a type of deep network based on residual learning. This kind of learning can facilitate the training of networks by considering the layer inputs as a reference [27] .

ResNet-18 with 22-layers are deep, starts with a convolution layer followed by 8 residual blocks and ends with a fully-connected layer. The main components of the residual blocks of ResNet-18 are shown in Fig. 3g . ResNet-50 is similar to ResNet-18 but has different residual blocks scheme and different number (16) of residual blocks that contain in the network (Fig. 3h) . The ResNet-50 contains 50 layers and same is true for ResNet-101. Therefore, it is 101 layers deep with 33 residual blocks (Fig. 3i) . The last network, Xception, is CNN based on depthwise separable convolution layers [28] .

The results showed that deep learning could distinguish COVID-19 from other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases with high accuracy. The best results were found for the ResNet-101 and Xeption networks.Although the Xeption network implied the highest performances in classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infections, it did not have the best sensitivity. In contrast, ResNet-101 could diagnose COVID-19 infection with the highest sensitivity and implied lower specificity compare to the Xeption network. It is desired to introduce a method with the highest sensitivity to diagnose all patients with COVID-19. In this regard, the ResNet-101 has an advantage over other networks, especially Xeption, due to its highest sensitivity and AUC.ResNet-101 is trained based on residual learning. This kind of learning can facilitate the training of networks by considering the layer inputs as a reference. In addition, residual networks are optimized easier, and the accuracy can be improved as the depth increases[27].This specific residual learning can lead to better training and provide robust model. Hence, the best performance can be obtained using ResNet-101. The radiologist classified two groups based on CT slices and patches. The results show that the radiologist failed to diagnose COVID-19 based on patches. The main reason is that a radiologist needs the whole lung lobe to evaluate the intensity of lesions and compare them with the mean density of adjacent organs and structures. However, since computerized image analysis can recognize the pattern quantitatively with more precision, the CNNs could classify two groups with improved performance. The results of the present study indicate that the discriminative power of the proposed CNN is improved compared with the radiologist (AUC of ResNet-101 vs. and modified only one CNN, and in contrast, herein we compared the ten most widely used networks to provide comprehensive results, and help the other researchers to prevent redundant analysis and select the best network for their works.
