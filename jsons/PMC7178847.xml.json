            "text": "Acute cervical lymphadenitis in children is most commonly associated with a viral respiratory tract infection. The lymph nodes generally undergo reactive hyperplasia due to the viral infection and are usually bilateral, multiple, and small. Erythema is uncommon, and suppuration rarely occurs. Viral agents frequently associated with a respiratory tract illness include adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, reovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. Other common viruses that cause cervical lymphadenitis include Ebstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus. Less common causes include measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. When bilateral enlarged lymph nodes appear in conjunction with typical upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, further work-up is not immediately necessary. The lymph node enlargement generally subsides spontaneously within 2\u20133 weeks. Enlarged nodes that persist beyond this time or continue to enlarge will likely require further investigation.",

The lymph node groups that are affected, in decreasing order of frequency, include the submandibular, upper cervical, submental, occipital, and lower cervical nodes. The adenopathy is occasionally bilateral but more often unilateral. The involved node is usually solitary, large, and tender. Erythema and suppuration are common.

The skin overlying the nodes often becomes dry and flaky, and can develop a pink or purple hue. Patients rarely have other symptomatology, and a tuberculin skin test is at most mildly reactive.

The infections are acquired through the skin or by way of the respiratory tract. Direct skin contact may result in a localized pustule, which can be cultured to establish a diagnosis. Nocardia infections can also cause significant adenopathy, in which case biopsy and culture of the node itself establishes the diagnosis. Sulfonamides are the treatment of choice. Actinomyces species are oral commensal organisms in humans. However, in hosts with compromised defense barriers, local invasion results in craniofacial actinomycosis and cervical nodal involvement. The diagnosis is difficult to make, but sulfur granules may be seen on histologic examination of an involved lymph node. Human immunodeficiency virus in children is usually acquired by vertical transmission from mother to child. Adenopathy is often a prominent manifestation and is sometimes the presenting sign.

Related constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss might indicate a disseminated process such as a lymphoma. Physical examination, especially serial exams by the same practitioner, is of particular importance.

Some also suggest obtaining pulmonary function testing to evaluate peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).

Lymphadenitis is the most common cause of lymph node enlargement in children. However, neoplasia and other uncommon disorders should also be considered. The patient\u2019s history, physical findings, laboratory tests and imaging studies are all important in helping to make the diagnosis and to formulate a plan of care. If acute viral cervical lymphadenitis is suspected, the enlarged lymph nodes should be closely observed for 2\u20133 weeks. If a severe bacterial infection, neoplasm or other unusual condition is suspected, or if the adenopathy has become chronic, then surgical intervention must be considered. The operative technique chosen is based on the characteristics of the lymph node enlargement, and one should avoid a general anesthetic when a large anterior mediastinal mass is associated with the adenopathy. Finally, it is essential to have a thorough discussion with the parents of the child regarding the rationale for the treatment plan that has been instituted.",
