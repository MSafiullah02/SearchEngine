An increasing number of infected with this disease causes the Inability problem to fully care in hospitals and afflict many doctors and nurses inside the hospitals. This paper proposes a smart health system that monitors the patients holding the Coronavirus remotely. Due to protect the lives of the health services members (like physicians and nurses) from infection. This smart system observes the people with this disease based on putting many sensors to record many features of their patients in every second. These parameters include measuring the patient's temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, and time. The proposed system saves lives and improves making decisions in dangerous cases. It proposes using artificial intelligence and Internetof-things to make remotely quarantine and develop decisions in various situations. It provides monitoring patients remotely and guarantees giving patients medicines and getting complete health care without anyone getting sick with this disease. It targets two people's slides the most serious medical conditions and infection and the lowest serious medical conditions in their houses. Observing in hospitals for the most serious medical cases that cause infection in thousands of healthcare members so there is a big need to uses it. Other less serious patients slide, this system enables physicians to monitor patients and get the healthcare from patient's houses to save places for the critical cases in hospitals.",

From the previous motivations (refer to Table ( 2)), finding the hybrid between feature level and decision level is more complex however, it has better accuracy. The new coronavirus has killed nearly 3 times as many people in 8 weeks as SARS did in 8 months [26]. Table ( 3) disuses the comparative study between COVID-19 and Sars in several dimensions. The main reason for the dangers of this virus is a bad impact on respiratory disease. That is caused by increasing high-risk cases by 20 percent of patients and killing more than 3 percent of confirmed cases. Sars is caused by killing 10 percent of infected patients. Older people, whose immune defenses have declined with age, as well as those with underlying health conditions, are much more vulnerable than the young [27]. However, death rates are hard to estimate in the early stages of an epidemic and rely on the medical care given to patients.

Figure (1) presents the proposed smart health system based on the communication between IoT devices in a network. This consists of three tiers: tier1 deals with the different sensors connected by the patient such as in mobile, wearable, IoT devices, or accumulators' sensors for measuring the patient evolution case (as blood pressure). Tier 2 the fusion between the data in multi-sources mostly in different multimedia. The tier3 the visualization and deciding for emergency cases, making profiling for each case, and how to predict the next problem for each patient. It proposes to be a time-series data that includes sequenced data points in a time domain. The data extracted from multiple sensors are gathered sequentially based on multi-variable measurements. It proposes a classification of patient's cases. It also targets observing multiple users concurrently. The proposed technique will be constructed based on the combination between the fusion feature level and fusion decision level. It will rely on the long-short term memory (LSTM) technique that is considered a deep neural network (DNN) technique for sequenced data [28] .

The proposed system E-Quarantine monitors the patient's case flow and predicts the emergency cases around 24 hours by 98.7% based on the supervised previous data. It is based on five parameters, blood PH level, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and respiratory rate. The proposed hybrid fusion is based on a hybrid of feature fusion level and decision fusion level that improves the accuracy results that reach 98.7%. Finding a Dempster-Shafer technique is more powerful in sequenced data than images or videos. The fusion technique is applied to sequenced data for patients and their respiratory sounds. For future work, the proposed system requires higher flexibility to be adaptive with multiple data types to improve the results of each patient.",
