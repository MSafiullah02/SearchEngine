Given variation in personnel across institutions, it is important to establish which departments (occupational health, infection control, quality and safety, human resources) will be responsible for communicating with and supporting potentially exposed healthcare workers. Creating a robust process allows all parties involved to understand their role and responsibility in investigation and disclosure. Adoption of digital support tools, like self-monitoring reporting, tracking and alert systems, can support operations related to exposures and disclosures. Notably, guidelines continue to evolve, and will depend on the phase of the pandemic, but should be referenced in making timely decisions like work exclusion. Regardless of the specific department and evolution of guidelines, the guidance outlined in the checklist can be tailored to the needs of different institutions. To ensure an effective process, staff trained in providing disclosures is important, and the checklist can facilitate training.",

At our institution, to avoid further exposure and facilitate rapid disclosure (within 24 hours of the exposure), phone calls are the preferred means of communication. Recognition that healthcare workers across institutions have diverse socioeconomic status, education, and cultural backgrounds is important in considering how information is relayed and what resources are made available. Once an exposure is identified, disclosure should occur in an open, transparent manner with sensitivity to both the primary language spoken and literacy level. Interpreters should be readily available, and clear, simple language should be used. Mailing or emailing written instructions in the preferred language may be useful. For all healthcare workers, it is essential to provide assurance that there is support as the healthcare worker navigates through this process.",

Similarly, asking the healthcare worker to identify others who may be at risk, including other healthcare workers, patients and caregivers can facilitate isolation and testing of other potentially infected individuals. Ongoing communication may be needed if the provider needs 1) time to construct a list of close contacts at risk, or 2) time to process the information about disclosure. This open, ongoing communication can play a crucial role in curtailing spread.",

Similarly, understanding potential symptoms, the \u201cwhere, when, how\u201d of testing, and how to protect family members from exposure, can mitigate the stress that arises from uncertainty. Finally, the question of returning to work and need for isolation may evolve with changing guidelines; disclosure teams should have a clear plan based on updated guidance and lay out the next steps for the healthcare worker. Managers should be provided parallel information to avoid confusion and misinformation.",

            "text": "Healthcare workers will have varied financial means and available resources; therefore, providing a list of resources regarding food security, housing security, and transportation assistance is key.9\n,\n10 Social workers can play an important role in this process. Not providing these resources to affected healthcare workers increases the likelihood of community transmission, and results in additional stress on the provider and dependents. For communities in which schools and childcare centers are closed as part of social distancing protocols, resources for healthcare workers with children to continue to work are critical; examples include offering emergency daycare facilities, in-home daycare assistance, and flexibility regarding remote work when possible. Similarly, for some, social distancing within the home may be challenging due to the number of individuals, size of residence, or individuals at higher risk of severe infection. Providing temporary paid housing, for example, in the form of hotel accommodations, may be necessary. In addition, providing psychologic support is of utmost importance, and institutions should provide adequate services to support mental health. Healthcare workers dealing with an exposure have to contend with the risk of illness, loved ones affected, and financial stressors as a result of time away from work, and mental health support can facilitate wellness. Peer support can be helpful, as with other safety events or exposures. Finally, reiterating a clear action plan and contact information as questions arise is important in supporting healthcare workers.",
