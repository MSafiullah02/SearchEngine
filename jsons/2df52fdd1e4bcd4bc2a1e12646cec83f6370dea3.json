We illustrate the potential of Internet data streams to improve preparedness and response in outbreak situations by drawing from recent work on the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. We show that Internet reports providing detailed accounts of epidemiological clusters are particularly useful to characterize time trends in the reproduction number. Moreover, exposure patterns based on Internet reports align with those derived from epidemiological surveillance data on MERS and Ebola, underscoring the importance of disease amplification in hospitals and during funeral rituals (associated with Ebola), prior to the implementation of control interventions. Finally, we discuss future developments needed to generalize Internet-based approaches to study transmission dynamics.",

However, transmission models require careful ground-truthing in epidemiologic data to generate accurate incidence forecasts, estimate key transmission parameters such as the reproduction number, and assess the strength of interventions required for control. Detailed epidemiological data are typically scarce, however, during the early stages of an emerging infection, owing to delays in identification of early transmission events, especially in regions with limited surveillance, and reluctance to rapidly release data in the public domain [2] .",

The world of social media and the Internet offers great opportunities to explore the performances of nontraditional surveillance systems in outbreak situations [3] [4] [5] [6] . Of particular interest is the reconstruction of transmission chains between successive cases (termed \"transmission trees\" or \"clusters\"), which is critical to understand the nature of exposure events and transmission heterogeneities, and the temporal evolution of the reproduction number over disease generations. Indeed, the effective reproduction number estimated during the early epidemic growth phase quantifies the transmission potential of an infectious pathogen, in turn informing the likelihood of large-scale outbreaks and the intensity of control interventions needed to stamp out the outbreak [7, 8] . Early estimates of >1.0 for the reproduction number indicate the potential for a major outbreak, and estimates of <1.0 indicate that small transmission chains are possible but that the infection will quickly die out before a large-scale epidemic can be generated. The reproduction number is a dynamic and complex quantity, however, that depends on local conditions that may change over the course of the outbreak, including behavioral and environmental factors, and control interventions.",

The concentration of human infections has been linked to the local population of dromedary camels, which may serve as an intermediate host for MERS [10, 11] . The human-to-human transmission potential of MERS in the community at large appears to remain subcritical; however, outbreaks tend to be amplified via nosocomial transmission [9, 12, 13] . Case importation from the Middle East continues to represent a substantial risk for outbreaks, as recently exemplified by the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea. We concentrate on this large outbreak, sparked by a single index case who arrived in South Korea on 4 May 2015. The index case developed symptoms 7 days later and did not receive a diagnosis of MERS until 20 May 2015, after having sought treatment in several healthcare facilities [14] .",

Systematic near real-time analysis of these online reports allowed reconstruction of MERS transmission chains, which can be considered a single giant cluster in this outbreak (Supplementary Figure 1 ) [18] . The full transmission tree comprised 150 cases linked to nosocomial events, where each case was classified according to occupational and social exposure. It became clear relatively early on that all cases were linked to exposure in the healthcare setting: 150 cases, included 107 hospital patients (including the index patient), 28 visitors or family members, 12 healthcare workers, and 3 nonclinical staff.",

Overall, this outbreak followed a similar trajectory to previous hospital clusters involving coronaviruses [18] , with early super-spreading events generating a disproportionate number of secondary infections, followed by a rapid decline of the reproduction number to <1.0 in subsequent generations as infection control measures gained strength.

He stayed with family, 4 members of which became ill, and died in the hospital. His body was taken back to the village for a traditional burial, where 3 uncles washed his body and soon became sick. B, Cluster 22 (Supplementary Table 1 ). During June-September 2014, after the hospital from cluster 5 closed, a Monrovian patient resorted to receiving care from her church caretaker, who then went to a clinic and infected a guard, whom a healthcare worker and father treated. The guard then infected his son, whose mother denied that it was Ebola. This led to the rest of the family becoming infected. C, Cluster 47 (Supplementary Table 1 ). In October and November 2014, an imam developed symptoms in Guinea and then visited a family in Bamako, Mali.

In contrast to the MERS outbreak previously described, scarce epidemiological data were available throughout the Ebola outbreak from traditional surveillance systems.

Publicly available epidemiological data from the WHO were largely limited to aggregate weekly EVD case counts at the country level. In fact, this was the primary publicly available data set that many researchers around the world used to calibrate epidemic models. Subnational case data became available later and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in transmission patterns across West Africa, which could have affected epidemic forecasts and transmission potential estimates [22] . And at the time of this writing, >2.5 years after the onset of what may be one the most important outbreaks of the decade, detailed transmission chain data arising from official contact tracing efforts remain scarce and limited to a few clusters [20, 21, 23] . While our study is restricted by the amount of online information that could be processed manually, scaling-up would be possible with more-sophisticated computational tools that scour the Internet, social media, and other big-data streams to identify information on a larger set of transmission chains. These automatically sensed data sets could then be fed into modeling studies of the type we have shown here.",

The frequency of Ebola cases arising from funeral and hospital cases in our data peaked during the early months of the epidemic, which suggests that amplified transmission events in the healthcare setting and during funeral ceremonies facilitated the transmission of the virus across communities. Hospital exposures declined considerably after July 2014, likely as a result of the improvement in infection control measures in healthcare settings. Similarly, funeral exposures have occurred sporadically during the later containment phase of the epidemic. The decline in hospital-based transmission is in line with a decline in the proportion of healthcare workers in our data and statistics retrieved from the WHO situational reports [28] .",

This pattern could result from a combination of factors, including changes in population behavior that mitigate transmission, characteristics of and spatial heterogeneity in the underlying network of contact over which the disease spreads, and control interventions. Standard compartment model theory stipulates that an outbreak should follow exponential growth before susceptible depletion or interventions set in. In contrast, a number of real epidemics have been shown to follow subexponential growth, with the effective reproduction number declining toward 1.0 in the first 3-5 disease generations, even in the absence of control interventions, depletion of susceptible individuals, or population behavioral changes [36] . The observed transmission patterns in EVD and MERS case clusters presented in this study, particularly the decline in the effective reproduction number over few disease generations, are in agreement with the subexponential growth rate behavior identified from population-level time series data [22, 37, 38] Temporal variation in exposure patterns and reproduction number should provide crucial information for the design and calibration of epidemic models particularly when these are intended to generate forecasts of the epidemic trajectory.",

Second, larger clusters tend to be included in news reports. Finally, the amount of information in each story or news report varies, with variables such as age and sex missing in the great majority of the clusters. Reassuringly, while our sample of case clusters extracted from Internet reports corresponds to just a small fraction of the total EVD case burden in the 3 most affected countries in West Africa, the broad epidemiological features of the Internet-based data (age, timing, and exposure) were well in line with summary statistics from health authorities.",

It is worth pointing out that translational research in this field has been slow or has not been properly recorded. Careful documentation and feedback from end users and stakeholders (eg, clinicians, policymakers, and public health officials) is warranted to foster further development and refinement of digital epidemiology tools.",

            "text": "Our work on analysis of transmission patterns from Internet sources has relied on manual extraction and analysis of text information, a task that requires a significant amount of time that grows approximately proportionally to the amount of data in the sample. Moreover, our search focused on Internet reports and did not capture other digital data streams, including Twitter and other Web-based resources. Scaling-up the amount of information used would yield more powerful and potentially less biased analyses but would require design of novel computational tools to search, extract, analyze, interpret and visualize unstructured data from different sources. Highly flexible open source programs have been developed to scrape Internet data and could be the bedrock of such computational tools, especially in light of the rapid expansion of mining packages in R [43] . Yet the development of these tools poses several challenges related to the need for systematic and integrated search, extraction, and curation of diverse Internet data sets that contribute information about travel patterns, changes in social behavior, exposure settings, and healthcare demand and capacity. Moreover, the analysis tool kit could include the detection of critical events (eg, effects of interventions), sentiment analysis [5] , and visualization of temporal and spatial epidemiological patterns. Other challenges in this process include the classification of large volumes of data with varying levels of reliability [39] . Clearly, further computational work and careful ground-truthing are needed to assess the potential of state-of-the art textdata-mining tools to compile information that can be used to model the dynamics of emerging and reemerging infections.",
