Samples were stored on ice during the collection, and Superase Inhibitor (Ambion) was added to samples immediately after the collection, to a final concentration of 100 units/mL. Samples were then stored in \u221280 \u00b0C, or RNA was isolated immediately. Stratified saliva secretions were stimulated by citric acid. Parotid saliva was collected as described by Lashley (20), using a Lashley-like cup that was fabricated by the UCLA Life Science Machine Shop. Submandibular and sublingual saliva collections were obtained by use of a Wolff collector according to the published protocol (21)(22). GCF was collected with the paper strip sampling technique with minor modifications (23). Briefly, 5 sterile paper strips (Periopaper) were gently inserted into the mesiolabial or distolabial gingival sulcus between the upper anterior teeth within 2 mm. To prevent saliva contamination during GCF collection, oral fluid was first removed with cotton rolls at the sampling site and the site was dried with a gentle stream of air. After 90 s of GCF isolation, the strips were placed in microcentrifuge tubes containing 500 \u03bcL of phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton X-100. When blood contamination was noticed on the strip during the GCF sampling, the paper strip was discarded. Oral epithelial cells were collected by use of a Cytology Brush (Medical Packaging). The buccal mucosa was brushed gently 5 times after the field was dried by use of dental gauze. The Cytology Brush was then place in a microcentrifuge tube containing 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton X-100 for 30 min. The oral epithelial cells were centrifuged at 14 000g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.",

We refer to these transcripts as the normal salivary core transcriptome (NSCT). As a first step to understand these NSCT mRNAs, we evaluated the integrity of 5 NSCT mRNAs from 8 healthy participants. The genes that we selected were \u03b2-actin, RPS9, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), IL8, and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT) mRNAs. \u03b2-Actin, RPS9, and GAPDH are cellular housekeeping genes, and their transcripts are present at high concentrations in saliva (6). IL8 and SAT were used as oral cancer biomarkers in our previous study (4). To first validate the presence of these mRNAs in the saliva samples, we performed RT-PCR using primers that yield short PCR amplicons that range from 88 to 154 bp (Fig. 1A ). These 5 genes, their full-length mRNAs, the expected sizes of the PCR amplicons, and the locations of these amplicons on the mRNA (in parentheses) are listed in Fig. 1A . In all participants, we were able to successfully detect short PCR amplicons for all 5 mRNAs (Fig. 1B ). Initially for participant 3, no amplicons or only small amounts were detected, likely because of the small amount of starting RNA material in the saliva. We detected all 5 mRNAs (Fig. 1B , lane 3*) in participant 3 by use of a 5-fold higher amount of RNA and 5 additional PCR cycles compared with the other samples. These data confirm that the NSCT mRNAs are present in the saliva of healthy persons.",

As shown in Fig. 1D , compared with the 5\u2032 region of the \u03b2-actin mRNA, we detected \u223c50% of the middle region amplicon (P <0.001), whereas the middle/3\u2032 region was present in similar but slightly lower amounts (P = 0.075). Analysis of IL8 salivary mRNA showed that we detected \u223c7-fold less of the middle amplicon (P <0.001) and \u223c3.5-fold less of the 3\u2032 amplicon (P <0.001) than the 5\u2032 amplicon (Fig. E).

To test this, we performed a time-course analysis in which the saliva was incubated at room temperature for different periods of time followed by RT-qPCR analysis of \u03b2-actin mRNA in the isolated RNA. As a control for degradation of nonsalivary RNA, we added purified total RNA from an ES-LW1 mouse cell line to the human saliva at the beginning of the incubation and monitored the stability of m\u03b2-actin mRNA. Because the \u03b2-actin primers used in the experiments reported in Figs. 1 and 2 recognize both human and mouse \u03b2-actin mRNAs (data not shown), we used species-specific primers for this analysis (h\u03b2-actin and m\u03b2-actin primers). As shown in Fig. 3A , within 1 min of incubation, <10% of m\u03b2-actin mRNA was detected. In contrast, the salivary h\u03b2-actin mRNA concentration did not decrease significantly, and even after 20 min of incubation, we recovered >40% of h\u03b2-actin mRNA (Fig. 3B ). The half-lives of mouse cellular \u03b2-actin and human salivary \u03b2-actin mRNAs were 0.4 and 12.2 min, respectively (P <0.001). These results suggest that the degradation of salivary RNA is relatively slow compared with the degradation of exogenous RNA and indicates that there is a mechanism by which salivary RNAs are protected from degradation.",

To exclude the possibility that these filters bind nonspecifically to RNA, we filtered purified human total RNA through different size pores and recovered >80% of the \u03b2-actin mRNA (see Fig. 1a in the online Data Supplement). The amount of filtered RNA is expressed as a percentage of the amount of unfiltered RNA. We found that the amount of salivary \u03b2-actin mRNA recovered from 0.22 and 0.45 \u03bcm pores was <5% (see Fig. 1b in the online Data Supplement). In addition to the saliva samples, we also measured RNA\u2013macromolecule associations in serum and found that \u223c8% and <1% of \u03b2-actin mRNA could be detected in serum filtered through 0.45 and 0.22 \u03bcm pores, respectively (see Fig. 1c in the online Data Supplement).

For 4 of the 5 genes analyzed, we found long PCR amplicons from at least 1 participant, suggesting that some salivary transcripts are present in full-length forms. In addition, many of these salivary RNAs are likely to contain a poly(A) tail because our microarray (Fig. 2B ) data were generated with oligo(dT)-based cDNA synthesis followed by amplification (4)(6). Our data suggest that different persons have different concentrations and species of long RNAs, possibly because saliva harbors different microorganisms that have different amounts and types of endo- and exoribonucleases, which affect the stability and length of salivary RNA. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, there are at least 2 known types of human nucleases that are active in saliva (8)(11), and different individuals may have different amounts of these nucleases. The presence of partially degraded RNA suggests that endonucleases rather than exonucleases are primarily involved in the degradation of salivary RNA, because exonucleases are usually processive, degrading the target RNA substrates completely or giving rise to significant degradation on one end of the mRNA, as has been shown for plasma RNA (26). On the other hand, endonucleases tend to produce partially degraded products when their concentrations are limited, with no preferential degradation at either end (29). Consistent with this idea, the data in panels D and E of Fig. 1 show that although the assay detected lower amounts of 3\u2032 regions compared with the 5\u2032 regions, it detected even lower amounts of the middle region, which suggests that there is no preferential degradation from either end. We have shown that RNA enters the saliva of the oral cavity from various sources; it is therefore likely that the degradation we observed in the whole saliva mixture is the outcome of different nucleolytic activities.",

We also showed that salivary RNA is associated with macromolecules because it could not be filtered through 0.22 and 0.45 \u03bcm pores. Disruption of these macromolecules by Triton X-100 caused rapid degradation of salivary \u03b2-actin mRNA, suggesting that this RNA\u2013macromolecule interaction is important for salivary RNA stability. This finding could be similar to what was reported in plasma. Plasma also contains nucleases, but studies have shown that endogenous plasma RNA is stable for more than 1 day (12)(13). It has been also shown that plasma RNA cannot be filtered through 0.22 and 0.45 \u03bcm pore sizes, which suggests that plasma RNA is associated with macromolecules (13)(28). Together, these data suggest that RNA degradation in the body fluids may be prevented by (a) protective mechanism(s). It is our future goal to test whether some of these RNA-associated complexes in saliva and serum are from the same origin.",

MUC5B forms oligomers that are highly glycosylated (30), and it is possible that in saliva, some RNA is associated with these oligomers. However, this cannot be the only type of RNA\u2013macromolecule complex because we detected RNA in the saliva from the parotid gland that lacks MUC5B. It has been speculated that in plasma, RNA-associated macromolecules are apoptotic bodies (13)(28). Indeed, incubation of RNA-containing apoptotic bodies with serum protected RNA from degradation (31). In addition, it appears that DNA in the blood originates from apoptosis or necrosis (32). Therefore, it is a possibility that some of these salivary RNA are present in apoptotic bodies.",
