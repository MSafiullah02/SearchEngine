A substantial proportion of pandemic and biological threat preparedness activities have focused on list-based approaches that were in part based on pandemic influenzas of the past, historical biological weapon development programs, or recent outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (e.g., SARS, MERS, Ebola) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017; Casadevall and Relman 2010). But such an approach inherently fails to account for agents not currently known or those without historical precedent. For that reason, preparedness activities that are limited to these approaches may hamper preparedness and lessen resilience.",

While much research on this class of viruses would be low risk and managed by appropriate approaches to biosafety, experimentally engineered antiviral resistance, vaccine resistance, or enhanced transmission, for example, would raise major biosafety and biosecurity concerns. The 1977 appearance of the H1N1 influenza A strain was thought to have resulted from laboratory escape (Zimmer and Burke 2009). It is important to understand the kinds of work being performed with these agents and, in particular, to know of experiments that are being done or are being proposed that would result in increased pandemic risks. Those experiments should have their own special review and approval process that is consistent with the risks and assesses the risks and benefits of this work before approval or funding of this work.",

These considerations could be moderated if they are considered part of a hospital\u2019s emergency preparedness activities and not exclusively as clinical (they also have benefit for antibiotic stewardship activities in both inpatient and outpatient settings). In fact, the use of these devices should be considered on a par with mechanical ventilators, vaccines, antivirals, and antibiotics in the context of pandemic preparedness.
