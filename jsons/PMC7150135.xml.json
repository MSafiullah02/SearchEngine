Concerned by this, the Sixty-Third World Health Assembly (WHA), the governing body of the World Health Organization (WHO), in May 2010 reminded the Director-General of WHO of the need for efficient gathering and exchange of information in and among countries; and adopted a resolution \u2018Advancing Food Safety Initiatives (WHO, 2010).\u2019 The resolution asked Member States to establish disease burden estimation and surveillance and to contribute to the timely conduct of international risk assessments through the provision of relevant data and expertise. And specifically the resolution called upon the Director-General of WHO to help countries build relevant capacity to improve cross-sectoral collaboration along the whole food production chain and to establish with the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) an international initiative for the collaboration of laboratory partners in support of surveillance of FBD, identification of food contamination, and emergency response, including outbreak investigation.",

The regional structure of WHO stems historically from the creation of WHO in 1948, where the preexisting Pan-American Health Organization was included in WHO as AMRO with an existing, independent governance structure. This independent structure was replicated in the other five regional offices, thereby creating an organization with not one, but seven politically appointed heads. In effect this means that each Regional Director is independently elected, and thus in effect can define policy course on his or her own. The regional offices receive approximately 75% of the WHO's budget and because regional directors are not appointed by or formally responsible to the WHO's Director-General, criticism has been voiced that some of the agency's activities are uncoordinated and not based on the best scientific evidence.",

Under the administration of WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, WHO in the late 1990s introduced the \u2018farm-to-fork\u2019 collaborative line with FAO, a policy line mirrored by FAO. This did not mean that the two organizations necessarily agreed in all policy areas, but a cooperative effort was underlined in most areas of work.

            "text": "Whereas the expert groups described above all typically respond to specific requests for scientific advice, in most cases from the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), WHO has in a number of cases initiated scientific work without such request. The examples are manifold, but three important examples shall be briefly described here.1.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health issue that is impacted by both human and nonhuman antimicrobial usage. The continuing emergence, development, and spread of pathogenic microorganisms that are resistant to antimicrobials are a cause of increasing concern. WHO's involvement in the containment of AMR due to nonhuman antimicrobial usage dates back to the late 1990s, and includes the hosting of a number of expert meetings from 1997 to this day. Although the other relevant international organizations in this area \u2013 FAO and OIE \u2013 were not immediately supportive of the suggestions coming out of these expert meetings, through continued efforts from WHO the issue has since 2007 also been included in CAC work. These efforts have led to clear recommendations about prudent use of antimicrobials in animals as well as a description and selection of critically important antimicrobials. Whereas some recommendations have been implemented in some parts of the world, a very significant number of recommendations have not. In most countries, antimicrobials are still used as growth promoters, and veterinarians are still allowed to make profits from selling such drugs.2.Acrylamide was until 2002 considered an occupational health issue only, as this substance had not been found in food. Therefore, it was considered dramatic news when Swedish researchers in March 2002 unveiled research showing very high concentrations of acrylamide in ordinary food items, such as French fries, bread, and coffee. Although some experts dismissed the importance of these findings \u2013 for example, with statements about how \u2018we have eaten these types of food for centuries\u2019 \u2013 WHO maintained a serious attitude toward these findings relative to a substance that had been proven carcinogenic in animals. Thus, a WHO/FAO expert consultation was undertaken less than 2 months after the Swedish news. The consultation considered that the available data suggested that toxicological findings in animals should be assumed to be relevant for extrapolation to humans. The consultation also provided a range of recommendations for further information and new studies to better understand the risk to human health posed by acrylamide in food.3.In September 2008, the INFOSAN Emergency Surveillance System obtained information from the Chinese Ministry of Health (MoH) that a serious and widespread contamination event had occurred in China. The contamination of infant formula with melamine had been spurred by fraudulent use of melamine to disguise the dilution of milk with water. Through further interaction between INFOSAN and MoH the issue of potential other use of the contaminated milk powder as well as parallel (illegal) distribution of contaminated milk powder to other countries was investigated. An INFOSAN Emergency Alert was distributed to the network and subsequently updates were issued regularly during the following months. A WHO Expert Meeting was held in collaboration with FAO a few months after the event unfolded in an effort to elucidate the normal (\u2018baseline\u2019) exposure of humans to melamine, as well as suggest relevant tolerable daily intakes of melamine through food.\n",

            "text": "People in ancient times already understood they could get sick from consumption of infected meat, and that keeping their animals healthy and using dedicated methods of food preparation and conservation could improve their health. Maybe the oldest written document about this, \u2018On Airs, Waters, and Places\u2019 is by Hippocrates that describes how human health is influenced by its interaction with the environment. A clear understanding of the importance of food and food safety for health led to the creation of the FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme in 1963, the active arm of which is the FAO/WHO the CAC. The CAC now meets once a year and agrees on food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice, typically developed in one of its 16 committees and task forces. However, the CAC system had become a very heavy system with significant bureaucracy. Realizing this, WHO and FAO in 2001 initiated an evaluation, resulting in some, but not very profound changes, including a higher level of inclusiveness especially toward developing countries. However, the system has also proven a capacity to move fast, even when dealing with politically charged issues. For example, the development of guidelines for the assessment of GM foods was finalized within a time period of only 4 years. When considering that such standards are developed based on several FAO/WHO expert meetings, as well as several task force meetings, many times with the participation of 50\u201370 countries, this is actually an impressive international achievement.",

Later in this article, forward-looking initiatives by the WHO in this area will be described, but it is noteworthy that it was only in 2007 that CAC agreed to start an initiative in this area, i.e., the Codex AMR Task Force.",

Nevertheless, CAC standards and guidelines have no legal status above this. However, WHO has an international legal instrument that covers certain aspects of food safety, the International Health Regulations (IHR), which is a legally binding agreement for all 194 Member States of the Organization. The aim of these regulations is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health emergencies that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. Such public health emergencies include risks related to food, because diseases can spread far and wide via international food trade. A health crisis in one country can impact the health, livelihoods, and economies in many parts of the world. The IHR aims to reduce unwarranted interference with international traffic and trade, while ensuring public health through the prevention of disease spread.",

Thus, countries have an obligation to inform the global community, through WHO, about any public health risk related to food, which has the potential to cross borders or that are otherwise unique.

FBDs result from the ingestion of contaminated foods and food products and include a broad group of illnesses caused by biological and chemical agents, which contaminate food at different points in the food production and preparation process. In work sponsored by the WHO FBD Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), it was estimated that in 2008, 1.336 million children under the age of 5 years die every year from diarrhea caused by contaminated food or water. Consequently, diarrhea is the second leading cause of death among children after respiratory diseases. In 2009, another FERG-sponsored study estimated that diarrhea-related deaths among adolescents and adults were 1.15 million per year. The total mortality of 2.486 million deaths due to diarrhea is more than deaths due to AIDS, malaria, and measles combined.",

The full extent of the burden and cost of unsafe food is currently still unknown, but its impact on global health security, trade, and development is considered to be profound. Thus, valid estimations of the real FBD burden are basically nonexistent. Recognizing the current data gap, WHO has launched an Initiative to Estimate the Global Burden of FBDs from all major causes using summary health metrics that combine morbidity, mortality, and disability in the form of the disability-adjusted life year. This has been initiated through the establishment of the FBD Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG). The FERG members are mandated to engage in assembling, appraising, and reporting on currently existing burden of FBD estimates, conducting epidemiological reviews for mortality, morbidity, and disability in each of the major FBD, providing models for the estimation of FBD burden where data are lacking, developing source attribution models to estimate the proportion of diseases that are foodborne, and developing user-friendly tools for burden of FBD studies at country level. Although the work of FERG was originally stipulated to result in (some) global FBD data by 2012, the work is still ongoing, and parts of the work seem hampered by recent funding trouble.",

It is likely that new genetic fingerprinting techniques will enable attribution for all pathogenic microorganisms related to food, and new chemical fingerprinting (metabolomics) will enable a significantly better understanding of the effect of chemicals in food. At the same time the new line of risk-based approaches will enable the setting of national \u2013 and international \u2013 targets for disease reduction, as well as provide the evidence base for such reduction efforts.
