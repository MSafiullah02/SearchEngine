Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff for each of these 2 inflammatory markers in differentiating virus-induced and non\u2013virus induced asthma. The optimal cutoff for IP-10 was at 168 pg/mL (area under the curve, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.0); values at or greater than this threshold indicate a viral trigger with a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 70%, a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 3.17, and a negative LR of 0.071. The optimal cutoff for TNF-\u03b1 was 54 pg/mL (area under the curve, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.48-0.94); values at or less than this level indicate a viral trigger with a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 60%, a positive LR of 2.37, and a negative LR of 0.083. Combining these 2 markers yielded an even more powerful test. Thus if serum levels of IP-10 of greater than 168 pg/mL and levels of TNF-\u03b1 of less than 54 pg/mL are present, the diagnostic odds ratio increased to 95.7 (95% CI, 4.6-1950) and the positive LR increased to 19.38 (95% CI, 1.29-292.05). IP-10 also showed some degree of discrimination between rhinovirus and other viruses. An IP-10 level of less than or equal to 1916 pg/mL (but >168 pg/mL) increased the likelihood of rhinovirus more than 2-fold (positive LR, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.86-8.41).",

Previous in vitro studies of rhinovirus infection of human cultured airway epithelium have shown virus-specific induction and release of RANTES, IL-8, IL-6, GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2.17, 18, 19 These findings are supported by increases in these mediators found in natural rhinovirus infection20 and experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma.8 Our work has confirmed these findings and, to our knowledge, is the first to extend them by examining the response of primary BECs derived from subjects with asthma and nonatopic control subjects. We were unable to detect any differences between the groups, although we observed substantial within-group variation in mediator responses. The inherent variation seen within groups was not due to testing inaccuracy because there was excellent agreement between 2 separate mediator detection methods (ELISA and flow cytometry) and all experiments were performed in duplicate. The mediators showing the greatest magnitude of response to RV-16 were IP-10 and RANTES. RANTES is an important chemoattractant for eosinophils and T lymphocytes and is overexpressed in allergic airway inflammation.21\nIn vitro induction of RANTES by rhinovirus infection of BECs has been shown to be specific to replicating virus,18 is triggered by rhinovirus RNA, and is closely related to levels of viral replication in BECs.22 However, RANTES production in BECs also occurs as a consequence of exposure to house dust mite allergen (Der p 1) and therefore is not specific to virus infection.23\n",

However, rhinovirus replication was much greater in BECs from asthmatic subjects independent of the inflammatory response that was also seen. We have previously demonstrated that BECs from asthmatic subjects are more susceptible to infection with rhinovirus, and they respond to infection with a deficient type I IFN response that is associated with increased cytolysis, which is directly related to enhanced rhinovirus replication.26 These results therefore support the concept in BECs from asthmatic subjects that there is a deficient innate immune response that does not adequately react to the levels of rhinovirus replication, although they are still capable of releasing sufficient inflammatory mediators to recruit and activate inflammatory cells to the airways that worsen tissue injury.",

However, when IP-10 was administered exogenously to the lungs of mice that already had established allergic inflammation, there was an increase in eosinophil accumulation in the lungs and increased IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels, and although airway responsiveness was initially dampened, it rebounded by 24 hours.31 However, CXCR3 is not exclusive to TH1 cells, with low levels of expression on TH2 cells,32 and when these TH2 cells are activated, they appear to be selectively recruited to the airways.31, 33, 34 These events clearly indicate that in individuals with established allergic inflammation, IP-10 is capable of worsening preexisting asthmatic airway inflammation and, in association with TNF-\u03b1, might lead to a marked worsening in airway inflammation and epithelial permeability. It is of particular note that IP-10 and TNF-\u03b1 were not as sensitive to suppression with dexamethasone, although RANTES IL-8 and IL-6 production were. This is in keeping with experimental findings that moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids are effective in reducing bronchial hyperresponsiveness and infiltration with eosinophils but do not prevent the accumulation of cytotoxic T cells within the airways after experimental RV-16 infection.8 Involvement of IP-10 and CXCR3 in acute virus-induced asthma might identify signalling pathways that are not as responsive to treatment with corticosteroids and help explain their lack of efficacy in this cause of acute asthma.5, 6, 35\n",

            "text": "The presence of an increased serum IP-10 level was highly specific for acute virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Although rhinovirus seemed to induce a smaller increase in IP-10 levels than other viruses, an increase of IP-10 level to 168 pg/mL or higher was powerful in predicting all virus-triggered asthma exacerbations. This suggests that serum IP-10 levels can be used to differentiate acute virus-induced asthma from non\u2013virus-induced acute asthma. Although at the moment no specific antiviral therapies have undergone a trial in acute virus-induced asthma, effective antirhinovirus agents exist,36 and a simple blood test that identifies those who might benefit would be instrumental in allowing such trials to go forward. Because we did not have a control group without asthma but with an upper respiratory tract infection, we are unable to determine whether the magnitude of increase in IP-10 level is greater in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic subjects. Viral infections elsewhere in the body might also induce the release of IP-10. Its induction has been well characterized in chronic hepatitis C infection, and it can even be used to predict response to treatment with IFN and ribavarin.37 Therefore other viral infections would likely also induce an increase in serum IP-10 level and reduce its specificity to predict acute virus-induced asthma. However, it is very unlikely that our clinical subjects had other viral infections. We recruited adults who reported symptoms of a recent upper respiratory tract infection. None of the subjects had another acute illness at presentation. We did not enquire about possible chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis B or C, but believe it is most unlikely that their presence would have confounded our results in these circumstances. The fact that IP-10 levels decreased dramatically at follow-up is highly suggestive that they were directly related to the acute trigger and that chronic infection was not prevalent in our sample.",

It is known that the airflow obstruction that occurs with asthma during times of exacerbation is characterized by lower lung function and less variability39 and that a history of viral infection is associated with a more gradual worsening of asthma that appears to be less responsive acutely to bronchodilators.40 The presence of mast cells within the airways and specifically within the airway smooth muscle layer is a pathognomonic feature of asthma,41 and these cells express the CXCR3 receptor, for which IP-10 is the only known ligand.42 Moreover, stimulated asthmatic smooth muscle cells produced more IP-10 than control cells, and exposure of human mast cells to these same cells enhanced their in vitro migration, a process neutralized by blocking IP-10.42 Therefore viral infection of the bronchial epithelium might lead to an early release of IP-10 that sets off a chain of events that enhance preexisting asthmatic airway inflammation and encourage the migration and activation of mast cells into the airway smooth muscle layer, thereby worsening bronchoconstriction and reducing the response to bronchodilators.",

We have confirmed, using a cohort of acute asthmatic subjects, that there is increased serum IP-10 release, which appears to be highly specific for virus-induced acute asthma and is also associated with more severe airflow obstruction and a reduced bronchodilator response. These results demonstrate that IP-10, perhaps in combination with TNF-\u03b1, might be a useful clinical maker to identify rhinovirus- and other virus-induced induced acute asthma and suggests that either IP-10 or CXCR3 has a prominent role in worsening airflow obstruction and airway inflammation in acute rhinovirus-induced asthma, highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets.",
