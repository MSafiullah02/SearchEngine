The linkage of our Emergency Response Plan with improvement in HCW influenza vaccination rates is a unique approach that can enhance the effectiveness of both programs. Using components of our emergency preparedness plans, including the ICS model, we were able to reach 72% of hospital employees and vaccinate 39% of our total workforce in a two-day period, nearly achieving the national average for seasonal influenza vaccination of HCWs within that limited time frame. With respect to emergency preparedness planning, the initiative offered an opportunity to organize, execute, and evaluate performance for mass vaccination/prophylaxis in the context of a drill. During the Push phase, the incident manager of the ICS was able to monitor the deployment and success of vaccination teams in real time and to maximize the efficient use of limited resources, and during the Pull phase to monitor the facility lockdown and the activities within the controlled environment of a fixed POD.",

Limiting access to the facility as well as restricting access to the device required to clock in for work only to those employees who had been issued ID validation stickers during the Push POD for either having received or declined influenza vaccine proved to be a successful method for identifying, reaching, and vaccinating additional HCWs. The use of mobile vaccination teams is an important and effective method to increase HCW influenza vaccination rates.26 Such teams engage in face-to-face interactions with HCWs to specifically address their questions and concerns, potentially resulting in an increased acceptance of influenza vaccination.9 HCWs might also be positively influenced by observing their coworkers accepting vaccination. The process also offered the advantages of employee convenience, avoidance of staffing disruptions, and no cost to the employee.",

Although many HCWs declined vaccination in this Pull phase, vaccination declinations had to be signed to clock in for work. Future exercise planning would determine if additional or longer lock-down periods at different shift times can be implemented at our busy urban community hospital. For larger institutions, the manner or feasibility of implementation of the Pull POD needs to be considered.",

Some reluctant HCWs agreed to be vaccinated because of the original mandate, whereas others withheld their consent while awaiting results of legal challenges. There was also anxiety expressed by some HCWs over receiving two vaccinations. In particular, concerns over the \u201cnewness\u201d of the H1N1 vaccine and recollections of problems associated with \u201cswine flu\u201d vaccine in 1976 might have had a crossover effect in creating or reinforcing negative perceptions about influenza vaccines in general.",

We believe that this model can serve as a dual platform for other institutions to improve their HCW vaccination rates and emergency preparedness planning. The ability to reach and offer influenza vaccination to a majority of HCWs early in the influenza vaccination season, and to accomplish such vaccination efficiently, allows for targeted initiatives for those HCWs most resistant to vaccination. Future studies should explore different approaches to the Push/Pull model as it relates to duration, frequency, sequencing, or separating its components to create best practices that fit the needs of different institutions. Mandatory influenza vaccination of HCWs would clearly have the most significant impact on improving acceptance rates but would still not obviate the need to regularly exercise emergency preparedness plans in preparation for other potential infectious disease threats.",
